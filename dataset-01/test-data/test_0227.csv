1,same ole same ole,"ms brown likes to use the *N* word in her books, i want to read a book to enjoy. i understand in older books before people knew better it would be there. but i do not see it to be necessary in this shallow novel. i will not be reading any more of her novels."
4,Great Read...Excellent Mind Vacation,"As a native Louisianian, I generally don't care for books set in Louisiana because they rarely portray the natives accurately. I read this book in 3 nights, though. I actually couldn't put it down. I liked the fact that the herione isn't perfect...she feels all the emotions that a normal human being feels. She's catty, but she is real.Excellent twists and turns. Highly recommended."
4,"""Big Daddy""","Nobody, outside of Tennessee Willliams, does the evil ""Big Daddy"" better than Sandra Brown. If you like Southern fiction you will love WHITE HOT."
1,Creepy Characters & Ridiculous Plotlines,"I'm surprised by the large number of positive reviews for this book, as I consider it one of Janet Evanovich's most disappointing works thus far. The characters had no chemistry, the plot was ridiculous, and I actually felt disgusted reading about their ""romance"", as the leading man was a compulsive liar and creepy stalker in a completely uncharming way! Stick with Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series!"
1,"TONS of mistakes, typos, incorrect formulas in EVERY chapter!","This is an AWFUL textbook. One person in our class has the 2nd edition, and it doesn't have any of these mistakes! The THIRD edition is a piece of GARBAGE! It was so difficult trying to comprehend complex formulas when the examples given arent even correct! Wrong values, wrong, math, wrong symbols, mislabeling...and we're only to chapter 30 so far.Simple things are OVER covered to the point of exhaustion, but when the chapter on filters came up, there was nothing to give examples of how to figure out how to do the problems at the end of the chapter. Power factor correction is barely glanced upon, and the author gives complex formulas when basic Ohms law could be used instead.If you use the 3rd edition in your classroom, PLEASE verify with your instructor so you dont struggle with the homework for no reason"
5,"Leslie's voice is soft and inviting, her lyrics are poignant","I listen to the lyrics carefully and often. And I find new meanings each time. It's clear she has the life experiences to make her words ""feel"" true. This CD is my new sing-along pal."
1,Interesting concepts but lacks detail,"The great thing about this book is that there are a lot of different parts to model. The bad thing about this book is that the drawing dimmensions are very hard to read. All models have step by step instructions yet some procedures have the menu selections in the wrong order or missing. The text is also very hard to read since the author goes off on tangents that do not apply to the procedure at hand. Do not buy this book to start learning Pro/E. However, the examples are great practice for the experienced user.I would not buy this book again! I recommend Pro/Engineer Solutions by Townsend as well as all the Pro/Engineer tutorials by SDC Publications. I own 4 of their books and all are worth their weight in Gold!"
1,"Offensive ""humor""","This kind of ""joke"" is totally ignorant of the misery of schizophrenia and how agonizing it is for people with the illness and their families and friends. Schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities so even the joke itself is inaccurate. This reminds me of the sick leukemia jokes that kids used to make. Can't we as a society get our laughs without mocking the sick, the weak, and the victimized?"
1,New Edition is Overpriced and Unnecessary,"I'm a university professor, and I've used the Norton anthologies in my surveys of English literature for years. But it's absurd that every few years, a new edition is brought out (with little or no substantive changes), forcing students to buy a new text rather than the used texts that are widely (and cheaply) available. A further absurdity is that the hardcover version of the 7th edition is only two dollars more than the paper. Anyone interested in buying the Norton anthologies for reading pleasure (rather than as a required text) would be just as well suited by a used copy of either the fifth or sixth editions."
1,"Arrived, Put batteries in, no cigar...","This item was delivered to my door, I put the right batteries in, and it just didnt turn on. and you cant return it. needless to say, im upset..."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!! worked for 3 mis!!!!!,"I purchased the toy for my girlfriend after she told me she wanted one...when it finally arrived we were so excited to see this baby in action... It was all good for like 3mins, then the vibration stopped working and it's not all that fun without it. Then to make things worse to get it replaced by the company will cost you atleast half of what you paid for it..I read the the reviews, ignored the WARNINGS..DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!!!!"
4,Best but no Stamina,"I've owned multiples of these. The first lasting a year, the next on a few months and last only a couple of weeks. I have tried other products than this but they could never get me there like this one. I don't know if I will replace it again or look for something else again. It's just perfect, until the motor dies."
2,Disappointed.,"I finally received the vibrator and was amazed by the prettiness of it. Was also amazed that it ""danced"", haha. I went to go use it and it doesn't have enough vroom. My regular vibe that cost less than $16 has more vroom that the rabbit does. What a waste of money."
3,Still getting used to it,"Good vibes very quiet seem to work great I just need a little time to get used to it. I have a mental block, any segestionsto get over them."
5,trying to help out,"This is a must buy. However, I would like to help everyone out who gets this and cannot figure out how it turns on. First, it takes three batteries, not two. I didn't think mine was working till I took the battery holder out and turned it over. Secondly, mine did not light up or anything to tell me it was working. There is no on/off button. Press the rotation button and then one of the arrows. Should work just fine. I think it should come with instructions because I can imagine that everyone is as excited as I was when I got it in the mail and isn't thinking clearly enough. Hope this helps someone. Definitely a must have."
3,Decent,"The toy itself is decent. The size, shape, and fit works very well for me. The rotation function is different and can feel really great, the bunny part hits the right spots, and over all I want to love this toy.However, when I got it, it did have a very strong smell and a sticky feeling coating on it. The 2nd or 3rd day I noticed the coating was actually peeling off. I called and asked them to replace it, which they agreed to, but then they sent me the wrong toy :( and after that I couldn't get them to reply to any of my messages.So yeah, if it was better quality it would be way better. The coating just kept peeling off and I had to throw it out."
1,Quit working after 4 months!,Worked great the first few times. I've only had it a few days over four months and it has quit working! Would NOT purchase this again!
4,Early rock -with strings - and great voices.,"A solid choice for fans of the late 50's pop/rock group harmonies. Not the hard edge of some but a softer feel due to the added strings. Still, this is a classic rock and roll group with a truly outstanding lead singer Jimmy Beaumont."
3,Fathers of tight harmony R & R,"Again I am not objective because I grew up around Pittsburgh. The Skyliners contributed two number one hits in 1958. A great regional group. Perhaps not an essential album but worthy of downloading ""Since I Don't Have You"" & ""This I Swear."" A worthwhile segment of early R & R. Not familiar with them? Give those tunes a listen."
1,"Will somebody please get this album out of ""The Persuasions""","Will somebody please get this album out of ""The Persuasions"" category and into ""Clive Gregson,"" where it belongs? Thank you."
5,TDOT Vol 1,"I'm not a biblical scholar and I can't read Hebrew, but I have the TWOT in book form as well as in the Online Bible. The TWOT references the correct page where words are found in the TDOT and I can then track words. After looking at the first 3 volumes and working some words, I can see how the TDOT is a great counterpart to the TDNT. I recommend it for anyone wanting to learn more about the Old Testament and the Hebrew language."
3,Not as fun as I hoped,"I was hoping for music with a lot more ethnic flair to it. There is some, to be sure, but it isn't as great as I had hoped. It's much more ""dance"" than Persian, but even in that capacity a lot of the songs are a bit on the slow side.If you want music that's more fun and danceable, I give it to the Turks and Indians. Turkish Pop and Bollywood are much more fun!"
5,the best children's book ever,"When I was a kid, my dad bought this book for me. the illustrations are incredible. It has a cute little story about a rabbit with magical powers and a czar. I love this book, and I have just purchased myself another for a university fine arts project.you won't be disapointed with this book.:)"
4,Great first helmet!,"This helmet fits our 2 1/2 yr. old son well. And is easily adjustable. He loves the way it looks! Wish the outer shell that has the fin was a little more durable. All the protection is underneath and the fin is just for ""show"" so it is easily dented when smashed or dropped. Still, would definitely buy again."
5,Why have I been using a gas mower? This Rocks!,"This mower is awesome, I can't believe I didn't know about reel mowers sooner. This is perfect for our small Arizona lawn. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to push (even my 2 year old son ""helped"" and pushed it by himself) and stays really sharp. Cutting was excellent and it is neat to see the clippings fly. I can't wait to have many years of great service from this mower. I will never go back to gas again!"
5,100% Love,"This mower is a kick! It cuts well, is quiet, fuel free, and provides a decent moderate workout. I'd buy another one in a minute, but I don't think mine will wear out anytime soon."
3,"Feisty philosopher struts stuff, walks like man","With its inscrutable title, is this the ultimate intellectuals' coffee-table book? She even manages to namecheck both Godard and the Beatles in the final line of the final piece (a reprint from Mademoiselle)! No doubt we all have our favourites. Mine might be the haunting little piece about 'being religious'. If we think we can salvage the good of religion while rejecting its excesses, we are deluding ourselves; 'an idea becomes.. impotent when it seeks reconciliation'. Battle on, faiths! Unfortunately you'll take us with you. (Of course it's not faith that's bad but fighting. Are you listening, America?) I don't suppose they've stumped up for an index to this new edition - but hey, it's journalism, right?"
1,This book is dangerously inaccurate and misleading.,"This book scares the hell out of me too, but for a different reason. It is full of factual and logical fallacies that sound good and could be disasterous for public policy and debate if followed. The fact that it is written in accessible way means that his simplistic and wrong conclusions will be leeched onto by the unwary, uncritical public who will read this junk. Read Paul Krugman's review in the Washington Post to get a more detailed idea of what is wrong with this book"
3,A good man who made a bad mistake,"Shawns meets Troi after loosing his mother to death. He and Troi starts a relationship that looks promising until she suddenly dissappears one day. Then he meets Dawn who mends his confused and broken heart. Again, their relationships looks promising until Troi returns out of nowhere with a baby she claims Shawn to be the daddy of.Confused on what to do, Shawn turns to his close friends for advice, which only confuses him even more. Ultimately, at the end he decides on the right thing: Being there for his child.This book was a good read for me. I enjoyed it, but would have liked to have read more about Shawn and Troi's relationship. Mr. Whitfield leaves his readers hanging with their vauge interactions. Other than that, I would recommend this novel especially if you enjoy humor in the midst of serious situations.Rolanda,Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club"
3,Blast from the Past...,"you can tell this book was written awhile ago, but it is an interesting read, seeing what they think is possible in the 50's."
3,Not bad.,"He didn't, take into account computers and atomic power ibut was a good yarn. He could have developed the alien races better."
3,Nice read,"Attempts to be gripping but fails.Character development lacklusterIf there is a book 2, I'm not really interested. I'm sure there is."
2,Really?,"I've only heard this one cut on the radio today, ""Mr. Elegant's Bow Tie"". The guitar solo starts nicely but then crashes and burns. I went online to see who it was so I could avoid whoever it was.I've heard Mimi Fox play some very nice straight-ahead things, but I've also heard some horrendous playing when she strays from the traditional."
5,great space saver,"extremely flexible product! i like how the seat moves, the tray moves, it is very washable and comfy!"
3,"OK, except...","I have a full size highchair for the dining room, and the space saver for my home office. This is an OK product, except (1) the vinyl cover is more likely to make the baby sweat if she sit in it for a little while, (2) I agree with the other reviewer, somehow the chair comes out the box a bit dusty, (3) compare with a full size highchair, it is built for a smaller/slim baby."
2,It's more like a TV show than a movie.,- The plot is typical of any fantasy movies.- The fighting scenes are laughable.- The special effects look like those of a TV show with a shoestring budget.- The acting is below average.It's more like a TV show than a movie. I regret renting it.
2,dont waste your time,"I'm a huge sword and sorcery fan. Beowulf and Grendal, The 13th Warrior, Dragon Slayer, Conan, and LoTR series, even most of the cheese that the sci-fi channel pumps out, but this movie does not even make the cut. Poor direction, cliche' from beginning to end, and the voice overdubbing is horrible. I watched this one all the way through then tossed the dvd in the trash."
2,Disappointing,"Could have been a nice little film. Great intro, first half was mysterious, entertaining,some cute scenes with the guy and very pretty girl romantic interest, great scenery and skiing.Then it was all, pardon the pun, downhill.The monster was silly, even for that time, although they did some niceforced perspective scenes. But the padding in the last half of the filmwas ridiculous. It needed to be cut by at least 15 if not 20 minutes.Long scenes of going from one area in the snow to another.And the finale was pretty disappointing as well. Rent if you're reallybored and want to do a bit of MST3000 quipping."
2,this is a very frustrating book to use....,The page numbers in the subject index are wrong (not just a few - about half of them); it's not a very useful book when you can't look up terms.
5,A wonderfully informative book,"This book considers the inspirational effect of the Bible on Western Literature and Art. It is based on work done for ""The Encyclopedia Judaica"" Dr. Sivan who was a major contributor to Judaica covers a very wide area in showing how central the Bible is to so much of the creative heart of Western Civilization.The reading of this work gave me much knowledge and enjoyment."
3,not so enthusiast,"Good recording,and fairly good music but not as I was expecting. The violin concert more convincing than the rest. I got this cd after buying the ballet Raymonda and that was good enough but not super convincing. This was another attempt at Glazunov before deciding to go for his Symphonies and Orchestral Music under Naxos label, we talk of about 20 cds. Well the decision is on halt because the Seasons, to me, is a half baked result. Some good moments are interspersed with outright boring ones and I am not able to catch the thread as I am in other composers even in their, let's say, bland moments. At any rate first class execution by Lenard and good sound. Then, considering the price, an attempt should be made after all."
1,Not Factial!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was very excited to see this movie. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed.A lot of what the movie said and showed simply wasn`t true! Flower`s sister Petal was killed by a goshawk not a snake. They changed the name Bulgarion to Titan and Ziziphus to Regan. They completely left out Flower`s cousin Risca`s one-year reign as leader of the Whiskers. Zaphod and Yossarian were Vivian rovers not Lazuli, and when they joined Whiskers they joined with six other Vivian males. Flower did not win her first battle with the Lazuli, she lost it. The movie needed more action (it was to slow moving) . Plus this movie does not show enough of Flower`s early leadership. Flower, Vialli, Holly, Yossarian, Zaphod, Argon, and the other meerkats aren`t played by the meerkats there supposed to be. Flower is played by six different females. READ TIM CLUTTON-BROCK`S BOOK INSTEAD!!!!!!"
1,Watch out for this one,"If you're really gung ho on feeding this to your cat, you might want to pull up a litter box while they eat. Otherwise you could find yourself cleaning diarrhea out of your living room rug.I originally bought three cans of Merrick cat food. The first smelled spoiled and neither of my cats would eat it. The second was fine, though they didn't like the chunks and would just lick up the gravy. And the third one made one of them (and then me!) sick.One for three is an awful average, and I won't be buying this brand again. I'll stick with Wellness and Eagle Pack instead, thanks."
3,Not a beginners book,I'm new to Photoshop and this book is not helping me to learn it. The techniques discribed in this book look great but you have to know Photoshop pretty well before you can use them. Probably a good book - but not for beginners.
2,Get what you pay for.,"These things are cheap, and it shows.I ordered 3 pairs of these to keep around my workstation and out of the 3 pairs, only 1 of them works half way decent.On one pair, the cutting edges don't even line up. They cross over each other.On another pair the cutting edges looked like they had been cutting some metal or something hard. There were many nicks on both halves.The handles are molded plastic and it seems like the mold has some leaks. There'sThe tools I received also had some rust on them. This may just be from the seller but could also be a manufacturing problem.Spend a few bucks more and get something better."
5,I love the west wing,This season is just as wonderful as the first- still brilliant and witty and intellectually stimulating.
4,Television at its best,"Aaron Sorkin is a genius and it shows in each and every episode. That said, the special features on this DVD set are pathetic. The few commentaries are banal and the gag reel is a whopping three minutes long."
2,Damaged disk,I love the tv series The West Wing. Its fast paced and current. I actually learn things from this tv show. Unfortunately one of the disks was damaged. The second disk/second episode breaks up. I had the same problem with another copy of the 2nd sesaon-second disk.
4,Good value,Since we had never seen West Wings we bought it to watch weekends when we go to Vt. The quality of the DVD was good and the story line fine. We have ordered season 2.
1,RIPPED OFF,"THE SELLER LISTED THIS ITEM AS THE ""COMPLETE"" SECOND SEASON OF THE WEST WING. WHEN I RECEIVED THE ITEM THE FIRST DISC WAS MISSING. WHEN I COMPLAINED TO THE SELLER SHE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO SHIP THE ITEM BACK TO HER FOR A REFUND WHEN AMAZON TOLD ME SHE SHOULD PAY FOR THE SHIPPING. THE SELLER TOLD ME AMAZON WOULD CLOSE MY ACCOUNT IF I DID NOT REMOVE THE BAD RATING I GAVE TO HER. I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER USE AMAZON TO BUY ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE OF MY EXTREME DISATISFACTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION. THIS SITUATION GOES FAR BEYOND NOT GETTING WHAT I PAID FOR. AMAZON'S COMPLAINT PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND INEFFICIENT. I TRIED TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT THREE TIMES ONLY TO COMPLETE A VERY LENGTHY COMPLAINT FORM NOT PROCESS DUE TO TIMING OUT ISSUES WITH THE AMAZON COMPLAINT WEBSITE."
3,A lot or information not easily presented.,"First off, any attempt to chronicle the history of psychiatry is commendable. The radical changes in the perception of the mentally ill and the treatment of mental illness requires a great deal of research and discernment. However, I found this book more encyclopaedic than a fluent historical account. Personally, it will probably serve as more of a reference than a straight through read. It does include many interesting anecdotes, just not fluently enough for me to read as intended."
4,Contractual Obligation Album?,"I agree with the other reviewers who said this album is a little uninspired -- just a lot of fancy pickin'.Kottkephiles like me think that's better than 99% of music out there, but I have to agree, it's a ""take-no-chances"" album."
4,Delightful Book of Japanese Fairy Tales,"Introduce your children to the wonderful tales Japanese children know and love! A bit abridged, if you know the tales already, but these are a fine collection.Little One-Inch is Japan's Tom Thumb, and he is shown wending his way down a stream in a boat made of a rice bowl, using a chopstick for propulsion.There are ten stories in all, sweetly illustrated in Japanese style. Kids 3 to 10 will enjoy these; my favorite is The Rabbit Who Crossed the Sea ...on the backs of sharks he somewhat maliciously tricks into helping him. The listener learns Rabbit's hard-won lesson about fooling people, and they are given a delightfully amazing picture of Rabbit using the sharks as an inter-island bridge.One warning: there is a color picture of Little One-Inch poking a needle into the eye of a demon, but I've seen more frightening pictures in Disney publications. In general, the book has nothing scarier than what western fairy tales offer."
1,Not Credible,"This biography reveals more truths about Albert Goldman than it does about Elvis Presley.An experienced reader will quickly detect Goldman's biases and turn instead to a credible writer to learn the truth about Elvis.Goldman's greatest skill is in finding unflattering words in his thesaurus.Ultimately, Albert Goldman discredits not Elvis Presley but himself."
4,Great for infants!,"This glider is great for infants. Our newborn sinks nicely into the seat, which supports her head perfectly. It is so much better than a swing, which sometimes leaves the baby's head without adequate support even in a reclined position. The gliding movement is smooth without any jerking motions to it. The battery life seems to be quite long, and I put in the cheap $1 batteries from the dollar store. The toy bar is just at the right height, since I see our daughter looking at the toys from time to time. (The only annoying thing about the toy bar is that it reminds me of the handle on a car seat, which it is not...so if I try to move the glider without thinking, and I pick it up by the toy bar, it will fall off.) It assembled very quickly and without any complicated directions. I would not call this a bouncer though, since it does not vibrate the way a lot of bouncers do. Anyway, this is a great product, and the price I bought it for ($50) was a great deal too."
2,So So,"I received this glider as a shower gift and hoped to have the same great experience that most reviewers have had. However, I find the glider to be overly loud (not the music, but the motor). In addition I find the motion to be jerky rather than smooth as the name suggests. My baby does seem to enjoy the gliding motion sometimes, hence the two stars. However, the motion is so jerky that when the baby has just eaten, I cannot put him in the glider with motion or he'll spit up his milk.Also, I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the base is so heavy as to make moving the glider or using it on a table impossible or at least not feasible."
1,"too slow, too big, too expensive","We received this as a gift, and my daughter did not like at at all (at least she didn't seem ""soothed"" to me). The movement was way to slow to soothe her and was not smooth like rocking-- unlike swings, it doesn't work from momentum, so it seems jerky to me. It is heavy, hard to move, and loud. She much prefers her swing, and it actually takes up less space."
2,OK as an infant bed,"Well, I guess every kid is different. I saw reviews saying their babies love it and can be soothed to sleep, not the case with my son or daughter. They can sleep in it, but if they are awake, they wouldn't want to stay in it and neither the gliding nor the music would please them. It's still ok as an infant bed. So now it's in our living room as a spare infant bed for my daughter."
1,I don't understand all the good reviews,"After reading all these great reviews, I made this buy. This product did nothing for either of my babies-- in fact it made them fuss, which was not their normal behavior. It did not move fast enough at all! The swing is far superior, so I don't get the point of having this. It takes up too much room as well. If it moved a lot faster or vibrated, it might be useful, but I wouldn't recommend this at all."
2,Don't waste your money,Buy the Bobby travel swing. There is one for a boy and one for a girl. It is low to the floor. It collapses a stores easily. I bought that huge swing that had all the bells and whistles on it. It was the baby soothing center. I had it ready for my little girl when we brought her home and she hated it from day one. We tried for months. I took her to my sisters house and put her in my nephews Boppy travel swing and she fell asleep like that. I tell you it is between 50 and 70 bucks and goes every where with you. A great thing to have that doesn't take up a lot of space. All these other swings are a waste of money.
2,Too Loud,I put my two month old in This glider and he couldn't stand it!!! Was way too loud when it moved & really not for moving everywhere if you've been on your feet all day.
4,Very - very good product. Buy it!,"We got this product for our baby shower and used it from our baby's birth till he was 5 months old and started trying to get out of it.I was at first concerned that it is so primitive, just gliding back and forth and it does not have vibration, but our baby never liked vibration and he would fall asleep in the glider and stay there for long-long time.We absolutely love it! The batteries it came with lasted all 5 months and sometimes our baby was in the glider for several hours a day. It is a great advantage that it does not need to be plugged in the wall so you can move it to whatever room you want.I only give it 4 stars because the safety belt got small for our son very soon and we stopped using it. Not a problem for us, but some people may want to know about it."
4,One of the best in this category,Product is sturdy and does not appear to be cheap. very comfortable for the baby. But make sure you want a glider not a bouncer while purchasing this item.
5,A MUST-HAVE FOR NEWBORNS,"I received this glider at my shower and it was awesome! When my daughter was a newborn, the soothing motion kept her calm and quiet. As a baby, she would snuggle up into the glider and looked sooo cozy! It trained her to be independent and saved me from having to hold her all the time. It's easy to clean and was a great gift."
2,Too slow to sooth baby,"This product is not versatile nor effective enough for me to recommend it. We got it as a gift and I tried using it every day for about two weeks and my baby would just look at me thinking ""are you crazy mom!? there is NO way I will sit still in this!"" She would just squirm around trying to get out. It is much too slow to do anything for a baby and is bulky and ugly and heavy as well! I got a lot more use out of the Baby Bjorn Sitter which is a little more money but my baby likes it, sits in it for at least 10 minutes (that is a lot for her!) and it folds flat and does not require batteries."
2,"Looks cool, but think twice...........",I was one of those parents who paid [$$$] for this toy. It's not even worth [$$$]. It's not very durable and the kids aren't at all impressed with it. I think it's horrible. One of the worst toys I've bought.
1,Typical Hot Wheels,"I vowed I would never buy Hot Wheels again because, aside from the cars, I've never had one of their products pass the durability test ... that it does what its supposed to without falling apart. I broke down and bought this for my son after much bantering. Result? Back to the store it went for a refund, with my son asking 'Mom, why doesnt it work like it did on TV?' Hmmm, good question.........."
3,The same as all hot wheels tracks,"As usual it has a hundred pieces to put together. Then my son loses the track pieces. The slime didn't last very long even though we put it back into the container after use. It was no time and it was dirty. We couldn't get the arm to elivate by itself. I was under the impression by the commercials that it would. My son loved it, but now it's just another toy under his bed."
4,Good,This was a pretty good movie but i have seen better movies. Wish it gad more action and killings. Overall i liked the killings.
1,Misinformed!,"This sticker is very inapproiate. Schizophrenia is not to mixed with M.P.D (Multiple Personality Disorder) or split personality. If you are going to make a product, do a litte research before you make it!"
1,Misinformed... Agreed.,"Jeanie, it appears you've already beat me to the statement I wanted to make!But I suppose I will add that even if the word 'schizophrenia' were replaced (on the bumper sticker) with 'DID' or 'multiple personalities', it would still not be funny. And not simply because we're talking about mental disorders. While I imagine this bumper sticker is probably not the best way to make friends--and mental disorders indeed are not a joking matter at least not close to my vicinity--it still remains that even if it WERE 'politically correct' and NOT misinformed... the joke itself is still plainly not funny.(And I won't even go into the hideous font and color.)"
2,so so,Looks OK even though not as good as I thought. The very bad thing is many fluff balls appear after only a week's use and they stick to hair and clothes! Now I can only use it on top of another blanket...
4,Sad but sweet,"Wade Hollister was given Joanna as a bride by her father, because he didn't want to lose their very prosperous ranch.Wade ran both ranches anyway.Wade took Joanna because he needed the money her ranch was bringing in to pull his ranch out of the red. Joanna left as soon as the ink was dry on the marriage licence.Now Joanna was 21 Wade thought it was time she lived up to her side of the bargain.But Wade's sister Megan was mean to Joanna.Until Joanna got fed up with Wade being short with her and Megan being mean to her.She lets rip.Wade now find he could lose Joanna to his best friend Holt."
5,Excellent look at a monumental time,"With the fight for health care, I've been interested in looking back at the administration of the last (great) liberal President: LBJ.For years his achievements in domestic policy were overshadowed by Vietnam.Time is ripe to re-evaluate his Presidency and appreciate what he and Martin Luther King accomplished for all Americans. What extraordinary men they were, what an extraordinary battle they waged.One negative: no Kindle version."
2,Good book for five year olds!,I bought this book for my niece who is three. Way beyond her comprehension level. Stickers were the best part for her.
4,a great reference for writers,I used this book for my my english classes in college and I used it more than any other. It is well written and easy to understand. It helps the writer find and fix problems with their writing with ease.
3,Needs Work!,"This humble writer likes the Cruxshadows. Danceable, with catchy lyrics and a wonderful live show, she often wonders why this band hasn't made the mainstream.That being said....She wishes the good songs, like ""Sophia"" and ""Windbringer"" weren't so long. Good as they may be, not everyone as the patience to listen to a five or six-minute song, which is how long on average most of their songs are.Also, this humble writer feels that Rogue should stop using mythological references in his songs. Not everyone unfamilliar with who Dido is, for example, wishes to have to buy a copy of Bullfinch's Mythology and page through it everytime they don't get it.Some of the songs, also, like ""Defender"" were so stupid that this writer had to skip them halfway. There are just some songs that Rogue's Peter Murphyesque aren't suited for.All in all, not a bad album, but not one this humble writer would want to listen to again."
4,Bonus for Quoting Eudora Welty,"As might be clear from the title, this is Southern folk, shot through with memory and heat. Kate Campbell quotes Eudora Welty on the fusion of past and present, living and dead. One song includes sound bites from George Wallace and Martin Luther King, whose voices -- espousing and denouncing segregation -- sound remarkably alike. Some of the songs are excellent, particularly in the second half of the play list -- Jerusalem Inn, Trains Don't Run From Nashville, and -- ending the CD on the best note -- Bury Me in Bluegrass. All that said, there's a torpor here too, not a whole lot of passion expended in the playing or the singing and a couple of very weak songs -- Locust Years, the album's shortest cut, seems endless and trite. Good, but makes me wonder if she challenges herself more on some of her other recordings."
4,Not just a Harry Potter rip off...,"I bought this book thinking it would be a total Harry Potter rip off, but maybe still enjoyable. Not far into it I decided it was worth a read on it's own merit. I look forward to the sequel. It's a nice, light, pre-teen intro into fantasy reading."
4,Good Battery,This battery arrived in a timely fashion and holds a charge as advertised. Would buy again.
1,Mediocre driver software,"I bought the Jabra BT620s and a320s together, and I've been quite happy with the BT620s (apart from co-workers making fun of my flashing ears), but about a month ago I ran into a rather large problem: I lost CD with the driver software for the a320s. This software was never great to begin with (I had to re-""pair"" the headset to the computer all the time), but at least it worked. But when I went to the Jabra site to download another copy of the driver, I discovered that Jabra doesn't offer the software for download. I called tech support, and found out that they won't even give you a new copy. Their only answer, again and again, was ""well, it came with the product, didn't it?""I've never run into this before: the software is just a peripheral to the real product, and companies always let you download the latest version of the driver from their site.I'm never running into this problem again - this is the last Jabra product I plan to buy."
3,Does not work with 64bit XP or Vista!,"We bought two of these - one for boyfriends XP 32bit computer and one for my Vista 64bit computer. His installed perfectly and works with no problems. Mine on the other hand would not install and Jabra's customer support center is full of people that have no clue about their products (at least THIS product). So, we gave it 3 stars for the way it works with XP32bit. We deducted 2 stars for Jabra's lack of customer support and their misleading product representation (box states ""works with Vista""). I don't know for sure if it works with Vista 32bit, but the product info should be clearer to avoid frustration. Finally found out it does not work with 64 bit programs. If you have 64bit and want a dongle that works out of the box, get an AZIO BTD603-132 or an AZIO BTD-V201 (I bought the latter - it's tiny and installed perfectly.)"
4,Decent Product,"Pros: Connects/Identifies my bluetooth headset fast.Cons: Not covering more distance, maximum covered is areound 25 feet."
2,Disappointing DVD,"I was very disappointed in this Travel Guide DVD. It gave no helpful information for someone who is planning a trip to NYC. It didn't even cover the Broadway theater district. Who cares about roller blading in Central Park? The only good feature was the coverage of Ground Zero. It touched on many items but never went into detail...such as walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, or how to navigate the subway system. This was a waste of money."
1,The Story of the Little Mole Who Went in Search of Whodunit,"I can not imagine how I would incorporate this book in my pre-k classroom. My 12 year old and my husband laughed, but for a 4 year old I find it totally inappropriate - especially in the classroom."
4,You'll be rolling on the floor...,"This book has to be the most original idea for achildren's book that I've ever seen. Hillarious,though probably more so for older ""children"".A must have for those who love a little bowel humor. :)"
3,An Good Book For Math Magic Lover !,"I recommend this book for math magic lover. All the math tricks have pre-determined outcomes that either absolutely certain or have a high probability of being correct. Because the tricks has pre-determined outcomes, we will not be able to do the trick twice to the same audience."
3,Imfomative overview of Frequency Hopping and a good read,"Engineers working with GSM networks that have not yet implemented Frequency Hopping in their system will find this book very helpful and imformative. The author presented the basic principles of Frequency Hopping and some enhancement capabilities in a consise way, however there are several optimization techniques that the Authors might have not yet encountered to maximize the network performance. Already available in the market are Automatic Frequency Planning Tools like CellOpt AFP that can handle complex frequency planning criteria for Synthesized Frequency Hopping Networks. Nevertheless this is a good read and recommended for Engineers and Managers wishing to implement BFH or SFH in their system."
2,looks better in the picture,"This costume is very poor quality, you can probably buy a better quality costume for the same price."
5,muhehehehe,"yeah, im not a kid. just not a big fan of filling things out online.anyways, this album was great. i enjoyed every song excpet maybe ""morgue than just words"". pick it up if you're a fan of the genre."
1,simply didn't work,"I just received this, put in brand new batteries, and it was already malfunctioning. It would simply turn off and turn back on and turn back off again with the slightest movement. Of course, I can't contact the seller to complain, because this seller doesn't allow that option, so I just sent a very long, upset email to Amazon support. Hopefully they can fix this and give me what I paid for."
3,"Just ""Okay""",This product is just okay. Nothing special about it. I've only used it twice since purchasing 6 months ago. I have a few toys and this one is rarely used. I prefer the Jack Rabbit. I can neither recommend or tell you not to buy this product because everyone is different and you would have to try it yourself.
3,Extruders in food applications,"It provides a fair enough overview of extrusion, but is by not means an advanced text. The book is not well edited. Several parts of the different chapters are alike, making the book appear disorganized. Furthermore, there were some mistakes in some concepts. Explanations for certain aspects were too elementary."
5,The King's Lust,"This is a novel based on the historical facts of Henry VIII's first divorce and subsequent marriage of Anne Boleyn. The story is entirely from the point of view of Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII's first wife who never agreed to divorce him. The historical facts in itself are fascinating from the multitude of different conflicts going on: the monarchy succession, the budding religious wars, the national-state rivalries, the personalities, the class struggle, all these aspects combine at a crucial moment in history playing the background to the story of Catherine from her childhood to her grave."
5,Excellent,One of the best guides for Family Businesses I have read. I already recommended it to my family partners.
1,Nice Try But Get Marine Aquarium 2.0,This could be a nice little product except the graphics are not very good. The fish movements do not look very natural and they look a little like cartoon characters so you will probably be disappointed. Check out Marine Aquarium 2.0 instead.
3,Not real excited,"Ms. Rysdky refers to allot of other books in her writing of this one. So, I'm not too sure how much information is truly of her experience. I recommend this book to someone who is just curious, like I am about Shamanism."
5,Worth the money!!,"This product is worth the extra money. I have the terry cloth covers and they feel rough and the elastic came undone within 2 months on one of the covers. I have two of these, one in yellow and one in sage. They are so incredibly soft and easy to keep looking nice."
2,Fluffer Stuff,"First Off this DVD only has 5 episodes1. Out of the Past2. Out of the Past II3. Nightcrawler4. The Lotus and the Steel5. The Final Decision (Bonus)Only 1 episode really has to do with Wolverine. The rest is fluff. In ""Out of the Past"" Part one we see how Wolverine got his claws. In ""Lotus and the Steel"" he goes back to a monastery in Japan. In the third and fifth episode, Wolverine is just a regular X-men. This DVD is just a way the studio can make a quick buck because of the X-men 2 Movie hype. The X-men Animated Series is great and should be released as a BOX SET, not single discs. But getting back to the DVD. There are other episodes that are probably better for this DVD. Like “Red Dawn” with Omega Red, “Repo Man” which tells of his claws and time with Alpha Flight. “Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape” tells of his time as Weapon X. And “Old Soldiers” which is about his adventures in WWII with Captain America. But technically the transfers to dvd look clean and crisp."
5,working wood,"excellent source for those who want to learn from a master,also excellent source for those who are dyslexic and not ableto learn in a class room setting. Paul Sellers takes you step bystep through the program and our highschool dyslexic son enjoysit tremendously especially being hands on. it is that easy to follow."
4,Cool and funky exotica,"I was trying to figure out how to explain the sound of this music and I can't do any better than that: ""cool and funky exotica."" The beats on this record are tight and most have the flair of a South American evening on the town.These cuts are ripe for DJ's everywhere to sample.Cool, cool stuff and yet another score for ESL."
5,Glorious sound.,"I think this was one of the first Haydn's sonatas recordings where the fortepiano was used.(Actually two of them;a 1798 Viennese Rosenberger and a 1801 English Broadwood.)The pianist,Richard Burnett,founded Finchcocks Museum,where this disc was recorded in l979;the museum houses an excellent collection of keyboard instruments.Burnett's playing is very fresh,especially in the first two sonatas,where he uses the Rosenberger with startling effect;the sound is glorious.The Broadwood used in the other two pieces sounds more mysterious,the notes emanating from the instrument in a 'halo' of sound.The use of two very different instruments was a felicitous one.Highly recommended."
5,Good CD if you're into drums,If you have an appreciation for drums and African chants then you will like this CD. Go for it! :)
3,JUST OK,"I'm a little disappointed with this product after all the "" rave "" reviews it has gotten. The producted arrived fast, fresh, and perfectly packaged. My problem is that there isn't a lot of apple/cinnamon filling in these tarts! The pastry and the icing over power the filling by far. The apple/cinnamon mixture tastes great, but there is just not enough. I also purchased the strawberry Pop Tarts package. There is about 3 times the amount of filling in those,( in comparison to the apple tarts). The price is good but it is more like eating a sugared tart than an apple one."
3,Its ok but ....,Well I did buy the game and if you are going to work out its a fun thing to did but if you have a x box are a Playstation it will be good to buy it for that. But the TV is not that bad but if I had a xbox or a playstation I wood have get it for one of them but if you are trying to loss weight and do not have one of the game system the TV is good but there is something I did not like about it The graphics are bad and no No words in the songs. But like I said it good for working out. and that way I will give it 3 star.
4,Kids like the dual DDR,"My three kids, 12, 10 and 8 have liked the dance pad DDR. We had purchased a different TV based product that did not work and this one was a better value and quality."
3,HOW MANY,DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MANY SONGS DO THEY HAVE FOR THIS DANCING PAD AND ARE U ABLE TO PLAY SONGS ON IT USING UR MP3????
3,Dance,This works with the gaming system I've got but the songs aren't great and the visuals are NOT good. Elementary.
1,It was confusing and boring,"I managed to watch the entire movie and it started out really strong. It was a joy to watch and then it just got bad. The plot went from topic to topic I had no idea what was going on or what the underlying message was supposed to be. For me, this is the worst movie of the year."
3,Simple and Predictable,The only reason I read this book was because my son has Asperger's syndrome. I will not read another book by Nicholas Sparks. The book is more of a love story. Yes like a soap opera. Nicholas Sparks is the male version of Danielle Steel.It is an easy read and is predictable.
2,"Flimsy Characters, Not Enough Conflict","I bought the book because the movie is about to come out in theaters. I've never read Nicholas Sparks before but I loved The Notebook (movie) so I thought I'd give this one a try. Right away, I was bored. All the characters were too nice, doing everything in everyone else's best interest, pretty much all the time. I didn't feel a deep connection between ANY of the characters. I think Sparks was trying to portray love at its highest form, where everyone thinks of other people's needs first, but it just didn't work for me. No excitement. John was so good and ""reformed"" that he barely wanted to kiss Savannah. And yet, he blows up over her suggestion regarding his father (whom he never felt particularly close to). He falls in love too fast, is then scared to act on it, and the story overall feels like it was trying too hard. I'm hoping the movie will be better."
4,"Easy-to-read love story, but too predictable","I decided to read this book after seeing previews for the movie (although I have not seen the movie yet). I was looking for an easy read that I hoped would not be too much of a cheesy love story, and this ended up being just what I wanted. Its not just a love story about a boy and a girl, but its also about a relationship between father and son (the later being what actually touched me more emotionally.) About halfway through, most things started to become predictable for me though. It does have a bit of an awkward ending, which left me wanting a little bit more, but at the same time I was glad that the author didn't sell out and conveniently kill off anyone just to give the readers the ending we'd want. Of course, it includes familiarities of North Carolina, which I love. All in all, an easy-to-read love story and I enjoyed it... just glad I spent less than $5 on it. (I purchased the Kindle edition for my I-Touch. Kindle is awesome!)"
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The issue of soldiers stationed overseas and all of the issues they deal with related to loneliness and stress about what is going on back home are very serious and important. So while I like the idea and storyline of ""Dear John"" I just simply did not think the execution was very good. The writing was amateurish and the characters were all very one-dimensional. I would like to see what a more capable writer could do with this same story."
5,True Sparks - Can't stop thinking about this one :),"You know a book was well written, hate it or not, when you can't stop mulling over the characters ofttimes days after reading the last page. I'm a Sparks fan, so yes, I'm biased and yes I loved everything about the story from the setting to the main characters to the ending even though it made me wince. I felt Sparks communicated the struggles a soldier endures not only before, during, and after war, but the internal struggle to exist between two very different worlds, one abroad and in combat and the other ""at home."" This very real struggle is what propels the story and it grabbed me at the jugular from the very first page. There are no political statements here and I loved that too. Sparks was true to himself as a writer and kept to what he knows and does best, the study of the journey of human frailty as our relationships are subjected to things larger than ourselves."
2,Was this really written by Nicholas Sparks?,This was the worse NS book I have ever read. It was a hole lot of blah. I was surprised that they made this into a movie. The lost song is much better and muc more worth your time.
3,"Good at first, disappointed towards the end....","I am always weary of reading a Nicholas Sparks book as I am always afraid that I will be disappointed in the end and this time I was. While I loved the book initially, I knew towards the last third of the book that I was going to be disappointed. The book did not end the way I had wanted it to, which would've been the ""how predictable"" way as other readers might put it, but I wanted to read a sappy, happy ending."
1,Too much...,"Yes, I read it and yes, I wanted to see how things happened. With the beginning I just knew it wasn't going to work out, yet I kept thinking that maybe the Dear John letter wasn't the end. Realistic? No. Desirable? No. Sad? Not really. By the end I thought the story was just too much schmaltz. My book club loved it (or so they say), not me. I've read better by Nicholas Sparks."
4,Cozy book,Again it was not what I imagined. I like Sparks cause he doesn't use profanity. Books can be written without it.
4,Dear John Review,"Savannah Gabbard1) John meets Savannah at the beach when her purse falls.2) Savannah takes John to a bonfire.3)John meets tim.4)John and Savannah quickly become more than friends.5) John get's ready to go back into the army.6) Savannah tell's John that she thinks it's a possibility that his dad has asbergers. (He is so distant, and he is obsessed with his coin collection)7) John gets mad and break's tim nose.8) Tim and Savannah forgive John.9) John goes off to the army. He promises Savannah he will marry her when he gets back.10) Savannah and John communicate through letters.11) Savannah quits replying to John for a while, she sends him a letter starting with ""hello"" and ending with ""goodbye"".Read it to find more out!!!"
4,Very real and close to the heart,"I love Nicholas Sparks and he definitely did a wonderful job when writing this story. There were so many times that I thought ""wow, thats exactly how i felt when my husband was still in the army""...I recommend this to any young women with husbands in the army or anyone who enjoys a good romance novel."
5,Dear John by Nicholas Sparks,The book arrived very quickly....and in great condition. I love using Amazon.com...it is thebest way to get a book and fast...and very goodprices. I can say nothing but wonderfulthings about getting this book delivered right tomy door. It is amazing. Thank you Amazon.com
3,It's okaaaayyyyy. Maybe a bit of a spoiler.,"I'm sure it's unfair of me, but I keep waiting for another Notebook-esque novel from Mr. Sparks. While this novel isn't by any means a disappointment, it certainly didn't end the way I was expecting (re: hoping!) and I'm not sure I like the path it took at the end. I did enjoy getting to know the characters, but I wish I wasn't ""leaving"" with such a bitter taste in my mouth about Savannah. Maybe that's the Army Wife in me, though... I will admit to crying more than once (while sitting on airplane, no less!). I'll be interested to see the movie when it comes out."
5,Another winner from Nicholas Sparks,"I loved this book from start to finish. What makes it so compelling is that from the start, the reader pretty much knows how it will end - well almost! Even so, I was propelled along, hoping for a different outcome or an unexpected twist. We got that twist, and although it wasn't particularly comfortable, it was totally in keeping with Sparks' understanding of what real love is.I respect Sparks for using contemporary themes and not hitting us over the head with his political agenda. That's not always easy to do for a writer. He presents the war from the character's perspective as part of the story and allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.I would love a sequel to this book - perhaps one with a happier ending for the characters. Maybe someday!"
3,Disappointing,"So much about this book irritated me. To be fair, I saw the movie first and read the book wanting more. The book took me in the opposite direction. Why is Savannah so annoying in the novel? Who approved the Hollywood ending when the book is so different? It is only right to say that my opinion may be colored irrevocably by the movie, which is why I gave it three stars. Otherwise I would have given it two."
4,Fast read,This book was a fast read. I enjoyed it. It was a tear jerker at some parts. I passed the book along so others could have an easy read.
3,Disappoints but a good read,"I LOVE Nicholas Sparks. This book was well written and did not bore me as other readers had said. I think that if I hadnt had high expectations, I would have enjoyed this book much more. The ending leaves something to be desired, but is a good contrast to the themes of his other books."
4,Don 't forget the tissues!!!,"Buy the book, buy some tissues, and read it! Definitly worth .y money, and a reread. :)"
5,Dear John,I loved Dear John so much such an amazing book it had its happy and sad parts. I recommend this book if you like romantic chick flicks
2,Could not get into this.................,I think so many of his books are getting to be the same. Nothing grabbed me about this one. Did not have that WOW factor of some of his earlier books.
3,OK story....,"Nicholas Sparks is not a Great Writer...his words have no Magic in them at all....he has no FUn element or style...none the less his wrtiring is very simple and esay...tht the fast read makes the book enjoybale...but here, theres nothing much at all...its a ROm-Com book but it has an Unusual ending...and thts the only reason why i am giving it a 3 out of 5....for not being so obvious...LOVE is not BLACK nor White...its the GREY space tht leaves u here nor there....."
2,A failed TV series...,"This is a compilation of 3 TV afternoon episodes which, after the brass at Disney TV animation viewed them, decided not to make any more, and release them on DVD after interstitial connections were made to sort of make them into a movie. Much the same track taken with ""Belle's Magical World"" and ""Cinderella 2"". When the studio execs judge that the three test episodes of a projected TV afternoon series aren't good enough to make it on TV, the DVD obviously won't be very good, either."
1,It's Pathetic,"To be frank, Atlantis 1 wasn't that good, but still it was a real honest effort by the Disney team. Thats why I feel that Atlantis is such a good movie (3.75/5). As far the sequel is concerned, I don't even give a .... If you just look at the front cover of this DVD, ull notics that the faces of Milo Thatch And Kida look VERY different. If Disney can deform the faces of the main characters, I would say that this DVD would deform the disney DVD collection of any Disney fan. Instead go for Treasure Planet."
4,Milo's Return,Another Disney adventure movie. Can't wait til my grandson it of age to watch this with me. I know he will enjoy it too.
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping for something like ""Little League Confidential"" for the college admissions scene, which may have been setting myself up for disappointment. This was a generally pleasant but forgettable read, with only a few chuckles and no laugh out loud moments. Basically an extended version of the ""college application nightmare"" column that every feature columnist for every newspaper in America churns out at one time or another. There are much better things to spend $10.95 on -- many of them that last longer than the scant hour it takes to read this very short book."
5,A Necessity!,"Would that Hank Herman's wisdom was available to all who have suffered through the college application nightmare with their teenagers!Herman's practical, funny, and absolutely scary scenario of the trial-by-fire that college application has become is a must for every parent of an applicant. Highly recommended.Linda Phillips,Darien, Connecticut"
5,Good seller,The graphic novel I bought off of this seller was in brand new condition as they stated and arrived in a short period of time.
3,For 2 disk product with DVD,"The music is 5 stars as usual, the DVD gets 1 star because it came as Region 2. I can't play it on any of my DVD players or computers. The web site said nothing of this and I paid a premium to get it. I didn't know about the region issue until now. Google and you'll learn more."
4,It pulls you in....,"I read this while in New Zealand, and it is one of my favorite contemporary works of fiction. The fact that I am a Christian and I wasn't offended by the relationship between the angel Xas and Sobran shows how skillfully and tactfully Knox writes. This book is full of aesthetic beauty-- the way knox descripes the angels, the land, the people, etc.-- but it is the subtleties that slowly pull you in and the give the story that real complexity and profound meaning that all great novels have. The ideas presented of heaven, hell, sensation and experience are thought-provoking and tied in to the story in a way that doesn't seem preachy or overly-critical of Christianity.That being said, this book is not for everyone. If you are especially squeamish, or are looking for a novel with the themes that reiterate traditional Judeo-Christian values, I'd stay away."
3,Not as Good as I Hoped,I thought the premise of the story was very good but the actual story didn't work for me. Some of the characters where well developed but I wanted more.
5,Yum!,Good price for this product. The scent is lighter than the cologne and the lotion itself is very moisturizing. I wish I could find Red Door in a bath powder and bath gel or oil.
2,But it somewhere else.,The basic content is there but the book is super small and the binding prevents you from reading close to the margins. The paperback is less expensive and easier to read.
2,Catechism Review,"The book contained all I expected. It is a good hard cover book and the only drawback is the printing is small, which may make it a little bit hard to read."
4,well written,Understanding one another is important whether we agree on a religious format or none at all. The information is easy to understand.
5,The BEST Lenny Breau EVER!!,Anyone who is a fan of Lenny's music needs to purchase this recording. This is far and above some of his best recorded work. The sound quality is excellent throughout and Lenny's choice of material is also excellent. Volume One was originally released on LP and then on CD but has been out of print for many years now. Volume Two has NEVER been released on LP and was available on CD years ago. The new 2 CD set contains both volumes with extra tracks and all tracks have been digitally remastered. First class Lenny Breau!!
5,Holy Wow Wow Wow...,The album looks incredible. I can't wait to hear it under some heavy halucinations.
1,NOT the Paul Roche Translation!,"This is not the modern and very fine Paul Roche translation, but rather the 1912 stogy, antiquated translation of Francis Storr. Full of ""didst"" and ""thou"" and ""'twas"" and other such pseudo Shakespearean twaddle. Silly and well nigh unreadable. I will be asking for a refund."
3,Fine,"Used, highlights annoying, not disclosed, but the text serves its purpose. Detailed Chapters explaining the brain's function, mind, memory, cognition."
3,Tire Problems and Belt,"Good piece of equipment with a couple of things the manufacture must fix. This is a rough cut mower, which means anywhere the four wheeler will go, it should cut (within reason)... it does. Problem I have had is numerous flat tires.. The tires are skinny, two ply tires, cheap as you can get, with an even cheaper inner tube. Flat after flat. If this skinny, then need to be a no-air tire... Personnaly, I think they should have been a low pressure atv tire, full of gunk, like the atv.Other things,Belt disintegrates if you bog down and don't turn the blades off. It is hard to change. Basically, need to take both covers off and the engine to install.The control cable is about 2 feet short to do any good.If the tires didn't go flat so often, it does the job of a 30K tractor for a fraction of the cost. And you wouldn't get stuck"
4,Dakota-Wagons West #11,"Purchased this book, along with 11 others, all used, in the Wagons West series. This purchase completed the 24 books in the series. Very enjoyable reading, historical, romantic, suspense, educational. Learned a lot about the early days of the forming of our nation."
3,Average,"It's a good choice to check out what Schumann is known for, but the interpretation often didn't inspire me much. For example, almost any piano player can play the ""Träumerei"", and this interpretation is just about like that. Not very inspiring. Sound quality is O.K. though."
2,Best of Schumann,"The best of Schumann is the only CD that failed to please me. I can't identify the music style and i think that Mozart has a similar ""weird"" style which i don't understand."
1,Looks are deceiving,I ordered this as a birthday gift for my husband because he specifically asked for the Chicago Roller Skates 805 series. The package arrived quickly a little too quick. They sent me the 400 series which I could of purchased cheaper elsewhere. I was highly disappointed especially since the picture shows a Chicago 805 skate. Use discretion when ordering unless you do not care what your getting.
5,great stuff,"This is a second one a bought for another laptop. The first worked so well, and that was about 2 years ago, so when I needed another one, I looked it up online and found it here. I like that it uses NO power from my laptop. whether you buy one with a fan or not, the computer still heats up. I like that it tries to keep the computer cool naturally. The air circulates under the tilt between the computer and the stand.Amazon.com has lots of stuff when one can't find it in stores."
5,Iron and Ironing Board Holder,Great item. Strong and convenient. Holds both iron and ironing board in one storage organizer.
4,Good product,"I was sick of shaving. I tried waxing and sugaring...too messy. I tried my mother's EpiLady when I first started shaving my legs 15+ years ago. I still remember the pain. I decided to try epilating again. This product is great. Not even close to the pain of the old-time EpiLady. Yes, it does still hurt... after all, you are ripping the hairs out of your legs! But, the more I use it, the less pain there is. It still leaves some hairs, but the product works better than I expected and my legs are smooth for about 2 weeks. The product info says you can use it on your underarms and bikini area, although I haven't been brave enough to try it. I would still recommend pretreatment with a martini...or two."
1,Listen-proof Zorn,"Sorry, this is of the Listen-Proof variety to me. I've got around 30 Zorn albums, but sold this one.If you like his really, really difficult music, then you might go for this one. It's improv, and there's little structured musical content here. Not hardcore--just not pleasurable."
4,Great condition,"I ordered this book for a summer class of mine, because it was cheaper to buy than rent from the school. It came very late, but was worth it. It is in much better condition than the school books too. The only thing wrong with it is VERY LIGHT normal wear and tear, just a little tear on the book binding. If all books from this company are in this great condition, I give it my top recommendations! Thank you!"
3,a little confusing,This book is a little confusing for a begenning Accountant. A mandatory book for college level accountants and business management undergrads. Good luck to future students!
4,Silk Road review,Delivery was excellent...but Silk Road is a little dull...mostly falls in category as a travel log. But will watch it but think will pass on 2nd box set.
2,Um... not that good of a book!,"This book I think was kinda boring because nothing new happened. It just talked about the cloud of smoke, helping them by giving them fruit and by tripping after tripping. It was really boring also because Count Olaf really wasn't in it so it didn't have action. He was in it but he wasn't in the setting. He was in the dentist office just waiting for Klaus to come and Violet and Sunny. It was really boring for me but I don't know about you. :/ WOULDNT REALLY READ THIS!!!"
4,The Miserable Mill,I think The Miserable Mill over all is great. The beginning of the book was kind of boring though. As the book went on it got more interesting. I read the first few chapters and could not put the book down. I read the book for hours!!! When I was finished with the book I was so sad because the book was so good!!!! I decided to read another Series of Unfortunate Events book. So yes I do recommend the book.
3,A Good Book,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment after reading the best, exquisite, awesome, kick rear end, coolest book ever, the Wide Window. This book is over okay but under great. It was only okay because you hardly see Shirley, and some of the stuff was just boring. But it was still a good book.TrEvOr"
3,Pretty good,"After reading the next few books this one just seemed kid of boring. It was not boring all the way through but, i have to admit it was boring in parts."
4,The Mill,"For the people who love the adventures of children, those people should read this book. It is easy to enjoy the writings because Lemony explains the words that are so hard that you would need a dictionary for. There is no was this book could be boring. There is suspense and mystery within these pages. I recommend this book to all ages."
3,The miserable mill by lemony snicket,"I am reading this series to my children ages 3 and 5; my five-year-old loves the series. After the first one, the plot is the same thing over and over and it gets old. Count Olaf always pops up, he is defeated, and the children are moved on to another care giver. In it's favor, it is a fun read (out loud anyway) and I like how they define words that children may not know, thus expanding their vocabulary. This book is about the same as the ones before it."
5,Great Book!!,Love this book. Wilton gives the how to on using many different decorating tips. Beautiful color illustrations.
4,L'ESSENTIELS,"I was not sure of purchasing this CD since I had heard just a few clips; however, Francis Cabrel has ""beaucoup de don"" on this CD. I truly enjoy the range of his vocalisations and music abilities. I can certainly see the reason he is a favorite in Paris and across France.When I mentioned the CD to my French instructor she stated ""que sa mère"" has a CD of Francis and sings along with ""La Dame de Haute Savoie"". His version of Willie Nelson's ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain"" is translated into French ""mot à mot"" and is quite unique.It is a joy to listen to his music. So much talent. . . . .voilàBon écoutant mes amis"
4,Best of Beethoven,"I am not a great fan of Beethoven. However, the legendary Symphony Nr 5 as well as the amazing Overture to Egmont will take your breath away !"
2,To Bazaar For Me,I have no argument with the authors writing ability the plot however is a different story altogether. I was lost almost from the get go it just didn't click for me and my attention was never engaged. It's one thing to be dropped into the past or future but to report to a group responsible for art recovery and immediately be believed by the hero was a strange twist that never jelled for me. I read this book only because it was offered as a free download and sounded somewhat interesting. I recommend this book if you like this sort of thing otherwise move on there are many other books out there that would be more entertaining IMHO. Enjoy
5,ROAD TOOLS RULE!,"GREAT NEW DESIGN! Needed extra pad for new computer. Older model is 10 yrs. old - this one is even better. Hidden ""wings"" give extra support. Increased slant makes laptop keypad more like a real keyboard. Highly recommend ROAD TOOLS for quality, dependability, and value for money. If you own a laptop, you should own a COOL PAD. Don't waste time & $$ on noisy USB gadgets that take up ports & break. Just get a CoolPad - you'll be glad you did!"
4,"Recommended, for travelers and home users alike","I use the CoolPad regularily now - it really does make a difference. Before, having set the computer down on a flat surface, it would heat up after about an hour, making me look for something to put underneath it to cool it down. The CoolPad is excellent, and not only is great at cooling the notebook down but also has some usefulness in its swiveling ability. If I'm working at a table with others, I can easily swing the laptop around to show them a video or a figure, and bring it back to face me. The stands grip the notebook well. It's not the fanciest device, but I wouldn't take my laptop somewhere without it. Highly recommended."
5,The best pad out there.,"I've had the pleasure of using this simple device for five years with laptops of all sizes and can say with all honesty that there isn't a better thing out there. If you have a laptop that requires another pad with fans to be blowing in order to keep it cool, well, you've got bigger problems. For most everyone else this does the trick nicely. The ability to swivel from side to side so I could show coworkers and friends what I was seeing is a neat ""twist"". It's slim, well built, and something that should with care, like anything, last for a very long time. I've decades in PC support with major corporations and have seen my fair share of junk being peddled and this is the one thing that satisfies my philosophy of keeping it simple, stupid."
2,I used to like Baldacci's books,"I've read and liked nearly all of David Baldacci's previous books. Camel Club wasn't his best but I'll give any author a weak one every now and then. However, The Collectors picks up where Camel left off and goes downhill from there. Baldacci's characters are either all sweetness and light or evil personified, the plot is far too contrived and his story contains several glaring technical errors. Sorry, The Collectors was my last Baldacci."
1,A disappointment,"There are two interesting overlapping plots and one, while developed, is finally just left unfinished. I wonder what was going on; did the publisher insist on having a final manuscript or is someone being greedy? If I am asked about the necessary sequel, I will not buy it! To quote the New England saying, ""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!)"
2,colledtors,"baldacci has lost his creativity in his style of writing.he has created a group of individuals in whom he can protract a series ofnovels with a thin story line.it's like the secret seven or the famous five style of novels.he is not the only author who has followed this path.i.e. Preston and Child have created similar characters in the museum series.sorry,don't like it."
4,It was a pretty good one,"I enjoyed this book, although I have a difficult time grabbing ahold of these characters (both this one and the Camel Club). Thankfully, Baldacci didn't resort to an amazing set of coincidences to make the story work. Overall, I would recommend this book (and have before)."
3,Not Much Suspense Here,"Read more like a story about the ""Keystone Cops"" than an ex-CIA killer and his rag tag bunch of friends."
3,Only slightly better than the first book in the series,"The first book in this series, ""The Camel Club"", was so poorly written and the plot so poorly developed that I almost believed it was a spy spoof. While ""The Collectors"" shows a bit of improvement in style, Baldacci still has a lot to learn about how to write a decent thriller. Right now he's almost as bad as John Grisham, except that Grisham's style and plots have actually declined over the last ten years.Since ""The Collectors"" was a bit better than ""The Camel Club"" I'll hold off any further judgement until I read the next book in the series, but I don't think there'll be much of an improvement. This next book will obviously feature a battle between Oliver Stone, Annabelle Conroy, and Jerry Bagger - and Bagger makes your average movie Mafioso look like a genius."
2,"""Disappointing Sequel""","I was not a Baldacci Fan. But someone sent me ""The Camel Club"" which I thought was great. SO, I decided to give Mr. Baldacci another chance. Was really disappointed in ""The Collectors"". There are just too many elements that Baldacci tried to tie together, in this effort.As a Note; one of the Editorial Reviews (Publishers Weekly?) confused Caleb Shaw with Oliver Stone/John Carr. Oliver/John is the triple six."
2,New to Baldacci,"This is the first that I've read by this author. I almost stopped reading the book during my reading of the first two chapters. At times his writing was trite and his descriptions just lazy.I think the book did get better; however, I'm not running out to check out his other books. Thank goodness for libraries, as I would have never bought the book myself.Oh, and I thought the Fox News watching reviewer's review was hilarious. Simply had me smiling and LOL. I'm not a Fox watcher nor do I live in the US anymore, but I didn't think the book was too left of center. Ah, the vagaries of our own politics!"
2,Not in My Collection,"Every once in a while I give Baldacci another try, hoping he will return to his earlier excellence. Perhaps a more recent book will deliver, however this one needed serious editing. I thought it would never end and then it did, sort of since it will be continued in a future book. I recall when Last Man Standing turned me off on this author. This one was fun enjoying the fantasy of con artists, but over 500 pages just was overkill. No thanks."
2,Boring..not to Baldacci's standards,Amateurish writing. Completely unbelievable plot. Author created situations that don't tie together just to fill pages. Worst book by this author that I have read and I am a regular. Very disappointed. Only reason to read this book t is that he introduced characters that will be needed to understand future Camel Club books. Don't waste your time with this one. Laborious.
2,A bit of a mess,"I enjoyed The Camel Club, but this sequel to that novel is a bit of a mess with a number of continuity errors. The material involving the short and long cons perpetrated against the owner of an Atlantic City casino constitutes the more interesting part of the book, but one has to wonder how the Camel Club members manage to survive in their segment, given how utterly incompetent they are. Time and again, they are kidnapped or blackjacked from behind. And I hardly know what to say about the convenient placement of a box cutter that allows for the improbable escape from deadly peril by two of the characters. If one can read this book with an entirely uncritical eye, there is some entertainment value here, but there is a nearly unlimited number of thrillers out there that would be more worth someone's time."
2,Amateurish,"I don't believe I've ever returned a paperback for a refund before, but about half-way through this book, I couldn't force myself to face another page. The writing is about on par with a 1940's cliff-hanger serial, and the characters as believable. I can't imagine what the intended audience might be.I give it two stars, instead of one, because I hold out some hope that the story might have been interesting if I had been willing to wade through the amateurish writing to the end."
4,Good tape to prepare your child,"I bought this video for my son (who was 5 at the time) because I figured he was going to be losing a tooth sometime soon. I wanted to be sure he wasn't nervous about it when the time came. But this tape, coupled with a few of his pals losing teeth at the same time really made him anxious to loose his!"
5,Best Pilcher Work,"This is my favorite of Rosamunde Pilcher's works. I read this a long time ago, and recently re-read it...and it was just as enjoyable. A sprawling novel with carefully drawn characters, and wonderful prose, I wish that I could give this book more than five stars. If you are tired of authors who dumb down their stories for a fast beach read, this book is for you. If you want a story that will stay with you long after you put it down, and may even cause you to lose sleep so you can read that last chapter, this book is for you. This is an intelligent family saga with romance, intrigue, and very thoughtful and colorful storylines that weave a beautiful, enjoyable tapestry. One of my favorite books of all time."
4,Easy read,Entertaining book. Easy read. It was not one of my favorites and had some parts that were hard to reconcile. All-in-all a good book
4,UO Rocks,"Ultima Online is still the best online game out. I have been playing for 4 solid years. Ultima is going through some growing pains and changes , some people whine at anything. Things will settle down and people will adapt their comfort zone to again embrace their favorite game.Come get Pk'ed on Atlantic!!Don't litsen to the crying Ultima Online is awesome!!!"
1,if it aint broke don't fix it,"This game when it first came out was simply great and remained great for a year or two and then they decided to ""up-date"" the game or to ""improve"" it which the 2nd age was a wonderful update but everything after that was down hill from there and the more they update it the worse they make it I realize there just trying to improve it but the game was better back before UO: Renissance came out and everything they have done since then including UO:R has been a major dissapointment and this new Age of Shadows update is without a doubt the worst one yet and i definetly suggest you not purchase this game unless you are already a UO player and are already deeply involved with a house(es) and extensive fortune if not play another game this one is as the title imply's only a shadow of it's former glory"
2,Put this game on hold for a few months!!,"I'm not new to online gaming but am to the Ultima experience and have found the game to be very enjoyable to play (more on that later). If you played AD&D while growing up and liked it then you'll love this game. Currently there is a major problem with instability with the servers used to play that Origin blames on not enough server memory. They state no more memory can be added to the current servers so now we have a major problem. Constant server crashes and more often than not, major lag becomes a huge factor making the game nearly unplayable at the current time. The features and gameplay are fantastic WHEN you can get on and play for a while. My suggestion would be to wait until summer before spending your money on this game. Maybe then they'll have there end working. A quick comment on in game support, I'm writing this review while waiting on it (6 hours and counting)."
1,Ultima Offline,"Up until this upgrade of the UO, things have been great. Since this update on 2/11, logging onto the server has been very slow if at all. If you are lucky enough to get logged on, then you have to put up with all the lag, either because of all the custom houses on the server now, or because UO was not ready for an influx of people, either way, it makes for a lousy time. The new world Malas is too small, and does not really add to the game at all. I hope they can fix these problems, but if not, then I will be looking for a new online game."
1,Complete garbage,"After almost 3 years of playing Ultima Online, and loving every minute of it, they release this Age of Shadows.They've reduced a wonderful, exciting game to a shadow of its former self. Before this expansion, your character relied on his/her skills to carry them forward. Now, it's all about the items you own. Their new ""item insurance"" feature ensures that if you have the gold, you will never lose an item, taking away the risk factor for almost every encounter, whether it be fighting monsters, or fighting other players.If you want a game that is a race to see who has the best items, by all means buy it. If you want a world filled with wonder and challenges at every turn, you missed the boat.Thumbs down..."
3,Not Enough Space,UO 's New expantion Just is not big enough as usual when it came out all the housing space was filled with in a day or 2 so any one that had delayed shipping lost out on a new house .The new area also is getting some severe Lag time even for pl with DSL and Cable .UO would have done better to make the house planting area 3x the size they did.
3,can't agree--this is a run of the mill dance track,"considering some of the incredible, powerhouse dance tunes out there, progressive, trance, tribal, vocal anthems,hardhouse, you name it, none of the mixes on this CD are really outstanding. Listen to the whole disc and you'll discover that, while it's definitely danceable due to the beats, the SONG itself AND the vocal melody just aren't all that interesting. There are tribal mixes, funk house mixes, and a couple of attempts at trance, but the vocals don't much go with any of the mixes, so you have just a load of ok mixes that you aren't going to turn to again and again."
2,YAWN !!!,"I'LL MAKE IT SHORT. IT'S NOT A BAD BIO, BUT THE AUTHOR RUINS IT WITH HIS SUBJECTIVE, SIMPLE MINDED AND EMBARRASSING PSYCHOANALYTIC INTERPRETATIONS OF NAPOLEON, AND THOSE AROUND HIM. COME ON, I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT KIND OF BABBLE SINCE I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND THOUGHT WE'D PROGRESSED BEYOND IT. I WAS WAITING FOR AN ASTROLOGY READING. IT'S NOT WORTH THE INDIGNATION, FIND ANOTHER."
1,Junk,"Do not buy this media, Waste of money, Bought it to use with my Toshiba XS32 recorder and they do not work so I was like fine I can use them on my PC take them to my PC and mind you I have 2 different PC DVD recorders a Sony and a Toshiba and they both wont read or write to them. These things are junk, Firmware is upgraded to latest on both drives, That is not the issue. I would give 0 stars if I could, A complete waste of money."
1,Useless media,"I've tried using these discs in several different DVD recorders and DVD burners. Same result every time, the product is a waste of good money."
2,"It's does have good range, but...","This thing does has good range. I was able to pull in signals from a couple of my neighbors. It worked in both of my new notebook (running xp) and old notebook (running ME). However, as decribed by some other comment somewhere. It started to stop responding, and in a few days, it went totally dead. Well, I am glad it died so early. Otherwise, I would not be able to return it and get my money back."
3,Don't know if its working or not?,I bought this item to use in our church building. The WiFi transmitter is about 40 yards away. I have recieved the signal up to 30 yard form the transmitter. In the room I am in I receive the signel but not strong enough. This item was not able to increase the signel strenght enough to pull in that last 5 yards.
3,Just Buy A New Drill,At $36. this battery cost more than a corded drill I had to buy (while I unsuccessfully) attempted to find a replacement locally.
4,Great Read,Great Read....couldn't put the book down. Can't wait to see what bp3 has in stored! Al-Saadiq is one of the best. Thanks
3,Better than Timberlake,"I will say that I like this style far better than ""Cry Me a River"" by Justin Timberlake. JC - you got it going on with this song. But if you listen, you will see similarites with the Symbol artist ... Prince. It is a blast from the past!"
4,Great Band...Good Album,"It seems Groundation continues to put out solid efforts time after time and this cd is no exception. The tracks with Don Carlos and The Congos are fantastic and ""Weeping Pirates"" is my other favorite track. Yes, the singer has a unique voice which some may find hard to take but I sort of compare the band to Geddy Lee and Rush because once you get used to the singer's style, the whole band comes together very nicely. The band has a fantastic keyboard player (and rythym section) who have become one of my favorites of all time. Many of the best songs from this album appear in dub form on their new ""Dub Wars"" cd which is also very good if you are into the band. These guys need to stop doing Bob Marley Tribute shows and play their own stuff more often. Definitely check them out."
5,My Faves,"Absolutely awesome describes the album! The Statlers are my all-time favorites. I grew up listening to Elvis, Fabian, The Everly Brothers, Dion, Frankie Avalon, Rick Nelson, etc. But the Statlers have won my heart hands down. The song doesn't matter...one just has to hear those voices and is sold. Every song tells its own story, stories that so many of us can relate to in one way or another. The guys are down to earth...I watch reruns of them on Gaither Gospel, sometimes 3 times in one week but each time they are fresh and new again. I will never ever tire of them or their music. I am going to burn some of my CD's so I can hear them sing no matter which room in the house I am in. A day without Harold, Don, Phil and Jimmy is like a day without sunshine."
3,Review of Book,This book had a lot of underlining and really looked used. I've bought used books before but never in this condition...
1,first book of crap,This was a waste of money. I'm not even giving it as a gift. It's awful. Don't waste your money
5,Great book,This is a great book for any fiber/embroidery enthusiast. It goes into the origins of motifs and embroidery techiniques from different places in the world.
3,"It's cheap, and will not last","I chose this dartboard because of the excellent reviews and low price. The colors, thickness and quality of the bristle is fine. Upon receipt, the bullseye area was compressed where the wires enter it, definitely a defect and a result of thick wires.The wires are too thick and poorly anchored. Because the wire is rounded and thick, many bounce outs occur... especially when aiming for the bullseye, where there are many wires converging on a small area.The bullseye is my biggest complaint. The wires are loose and have de-lodged from the bullseye. This happened within a few weeks of use!!! (see my photos)I would not recommend this item, but for $25 it is hard to pass up."
4,A selection of fine furniture,"This book has an excellent selection of photographs of fine furniture of the 18th Century. The most notable thing about the book is that the author has exhibited fairly good taste in his selection of specimens to include, and has largely ignored the more shabby pieces of the era. This is in contrast with Nutting's ""Furniture Treasury"", which has truly extensive selections of photographs of all furniture of the era (good, bad, or indifferent). Greene's book also contains good historical information on the furniture trade of that era, and has an excellent bibliography of furniture books written in the 18th Century (some of which remain available).The author is a former mechanical engineer, who now hand crafts replica 18th Century furniture for a living."
2,Wavered whether to select 1 or 2 stars,"Disappointed. His logic and reasoning is poor. Was looking for something that gave not only valid scientific evidence but also something that discusses specific Biblical passages as they written in original languages. I'll try another writer. Hoping to find that 'one book' that gives a good argument to buy for friends who are new earthers or who are agnostic. I happen to already be convinced of old earth just by reading the Bible without a preconceived idea. I gave him 2 stars because his heart seemed to be in the right place, and so I feel it would not be charitable to say I hated it."
2,Buyer Beware,"Until I purchased my last rod, a St.Croix, I fished exclusively with Shimano and, with the notable exception of the Syncopate, I cannot complain about Shimano. The Syncopate, though, is a different matter. I tried three separate times to line this reel up and each time the line came loose and, as a result, line was pulled out with no drag at all and the reel could not pull the line back in. I attempted to contact Shimano about the problem and received no reply. After abandoning the Syncopate, I bought a Shimano R2000 reel for $10. It is remarkably smooth and I am getting better cast distances from the $10 R200 than from the $40 Syncopate."
2,waste of money,"Doesn't work like intended, but after hours it grabbed the limb so I could use my chainsaw to cut it and pull it down. I had to go the hardware store and replace the flimsy clip because the sand bag kept coming off with each throw. I can use it ,but not as it was intended. Thank goodness it was on sale."
3,Ok,Its ok. The rope is very cheap and came apart after the first time using it. I had to add my own rope to use it.
1,Poorly made - waste of money,While cutting down the first and only branch the bands that old the rope closed on each end of the chain saw and the one that holds the loop for the bag all broke along with one of the handles at the end of the chain saw. Poorly made if it cannot even cut one branch before falling apart.
4,Worth the money!,"We did increase the weight on the metal directional tag by adding duct tape and replaced the cheap little clip on the bean bag with a small carabiner for easier on&off. With these adjustments the rope saw worked splendidly, cutting limbs from 1"" to 8"" in diameter. We loved it!"
3,Works with a little effort,"Hardest part is getting the line over higher branches, especially if they're a little crowded. Found that underhand tosses worked best. Getting the chain to line up on the cutting edge is tricky too. You can't always get the 45 degree angle in the instructions. But once you get everything lined up, it cuts well. Like other reviewers, I found the bag clip to be very flimsy. A good plastic tie wrap will work better.Free Amazon shipping was very fast."
4,not bad,"worked right on a few 4-5 inch limbs that i had to remove, though it did pinch really bad on one of them as the limb bent down. wasn't the saw's fault tho. as this is likly to happen again, i will keep a couple long pieces of pvc pipe around to lift the limb and unstick the saw."
5,Worked like a charm,"I received this & soon after had removed a large (6-7"") limb and had it on the ground by myself, great product I hope it holds up because I have lots more limbs to go!"
1,High Limb CS-48 Rope-and-Chain Saw,Unable to use. Chain would not stay cutting edge down. It kept twisting over and would not cut thru the limb.
4,Worth it,"Having read previous reviews regarding the inadequate bag clip, I immediately changed it. Binding can be a pain in the neck, but in general it is worth the investment as cutting is fairly fast and there is no other way to get at some of those high branches."
5,Who Doesn't Like A Bargain?,"This book sits in my car's center console because it offers a thorough listing of the many thrift, antique and consignment shops in the California Bay Area.For those of us who enjoy this type of shopping/spending - this guide makes it possible to locate the often hard-to-find secret stores in unfamilar towns (or perhaps right under your nose?!).Akers divides the book by counties, and within each county she notes the name of each shop, their address and phone number, plus information regarding any organization affiliation (such as salvation army.)Underneath each shop heading is a comprehensive account of what the store specializes in - prices you can expect - and specials or events to watch for...In other words, if you are looking for furniture while driving past Hayward - you might want to check out the thrift store on Suchandsuch St.Your second-hand shopping will never be the same with so much out there to explore."
1,Dice Bell,"Not packed well...Ordered two bells,skull and dice.skull bell wraped in bubble wrap and dice bell loose in box. Electra logo scratched from loose packing.Expected better packing/"
3,Not so much Pursuit of the Grander as writers travel diary,"An entertaining book, although the title is a little misleading. This isn't about one persons dogged pursuit of a 1000lb Marlin but a diary of trips where the author is asked to captain or share the boats of the world's moneyed anglers. The narrative jumps a little and you can lose track as to when he is referring his accounts. The book was not proof read very well as the grammar leaves something to be desired at times and can make you go over a sentence a couple of times. These gripes aside, the book is an enjoyable read to anyone interested in the world of big game fishing and this type of book makes a refreshing change to the 'how to' manuals. Bring the price down a bit though!"
5,Good beginnings for Blinking Red Light,The book was awesome. Once I got started I didn't want to put the book down. It keep me wanting to flip to the next page. The author did a good job of keeping me enticed. I give this book a five star.
3,4/3 and not micro 4/3,I have a Panasonic GF1.... It's a Micro 4/3 camerathis lens is a for 4/3 camerasSo just be aware that you need a DMW-MA1 Mount Adapter to fit this ring on an micro 4/3.I must admit that it is my fault but a focus on this possible problem would have been apreciate.I ordered the Adpator... so didn't have time to use the lens.. but I'm confident
2,A Disappointment,"Allowing for the fact that the section on the C-17 will be, of necessity, short this is still a very brief look at the three airframes that have borne the Globemaster name.The parts dealing with the C-74 and C-124 (which are presumably why the majority of purchasers would want this book) leave far, far too much of the story of this interesting transport untold. There is a good book to be written on the Globemaster story but this is not it.A further annoyance is that the book is absolutely littered with spelling mistakes.Buy this only if you're a real die-hard Globemaster enthusiast."
3,Big plane,I was hoping for more about the C-74. Most of the book is dedicated to the C-124. There were only a handful of pictures of the C-74. My Dad had flown this plane out of Brookley and I was looking forward to more pictures I guess.
1,"Actually, I give the book no stars!","The book states that the files used to gain an insite into Fireworks 4 are available to download. No files or CDs come with the book. The publisher considers the book to be out of print, and therefore all Fireworks 4 files have been taken off of their website. There is no reason to buy the book, since there are no hands on files to use in conjunction with the book."
4,What a story!,"I really enjoyed this book, although I have to admit I almost put it down after reading the first chapter because I couldn't handle the abuse she received. I really enjoyed the part in the convent, I found it very interesting and informative. The only part I disliked was that Gabbie wasn't able to face her mother in the end. Although I know Gabbie wasn't the type to ""get even"", I was hoping her mother would have been made accountable for her horendous behaviour while she was still alive."
3,My first and possibly last,"This was not at all what I had expected after all the hoopla over Danielle Steele. I'm gonna try one more and see if it's better. If not, on to the next author."
5,Couldn't put it down,Steel gets better and better. It's hard to believe that someone could survive this abuse. Very thought provoking
3,the f/x are still pretty good but the story really shows it's age,"i loved this one as a kid but though the f/x still look good today the story really isn't that good. while i was young i guess i must not have been able to see all the problems with the script,like the way the captian suddenly becomes a slave to religion when up till then that was never brought up is a little silly and it makes me mad that the only person on the trip who has religion is played as the nut who may kill them all. i still like the movie but this little fact took a lot of the fun away for me,still we have a classic sci-fi movie that i like but the religion as the bad guy hurts the over all story!"
3,"B scifi by Pal, but only a C- feature","Conquest of Space was produced by George Pal. I bought it out of curiosity. It is a 50's space flick with the donut space station housing space experiments and military power. The story begins by exposing the stress level of the current personnel. The acting is so-so and the script isn't much better. It has nice sets and effects (if you ignore some physics) for 1955. I do not regret my purchase, but there are many films on this site which are far far better than this one. Cast includes William Hopper (Paul Drake) and Benson Fong (Charlie Chan character)."
2,"Disappointing sci-fi ""realism"".","This 1955 epic was a commendable effort by producer George Pal to give the public a more-or-less realistic look at what space travel might be like a few decades ahead, with no monsters and aliens and all that. But the result is a film that is MORE dated, and less enjoyable, than SF films made even earlier which DID have monsters and aliens and all that. Almost every character is a corny stereotype, including the inevitable crude -but-basically-smart funny guy from Brooklyn. The film includes two memorably ridiculous plot contrivances."
3,We are going where?,"Pretty good sci-fi story of a trip to Mars. No monsters, aliens or black holes but still a pretty entertaining picture. Eric Fleming of Rawhide fame is the main player. If drama and comic relief are your meat, then you should enjoy this film."
1,the Real Thing,this Concert was at a small dinner club... I'm sure the people that attended had a great time for it being up close and personal...but it's is not a good show.
3,Not for older kitties,"I have 3 mature kitties - over 9 years - and this tunnel really didn't do anything for them. One was curious to go through it, but that's about it."
2,Disappointment,"Since my cats *love* tunnels, I ordered this one, my second, because it was a lot longer than the first. Alas, the wiring around the openings isn't sturdy enough to keep it open. Once it collapses, that's the end of the tunnel fun."
3,"good reading, but biased","i read this for an assignment for a history class. it turned out to be worth the time i spent on it which is more than i can say about many other books i have read; however, the author is very biased in his assessment of the israeli-palestinian conflict. though he uses a variety of examples to show the injustices against the palestinians, he does not once bring the palestinians into judgment. not a word about the suicide bombings, attacks on civilians, threats against america and europe, and constant foreign aggression (though he talks about this subject, it does not due justice to israel... example, painting them as the aggressor in many of the wars). don't get me wrong, burge did open my eyes to many of the injustices the palestinians are put through, burge does not however give equal billing to the same, or worse, acts of terror by non-israelis."
4,The Carnivorous carnival,This is the 9th book of the series of unfortunate events. The Beldalairs are now in the Hinter Lands. They have put on disguises on so the Count Olaf will not recognize them. They are here to figure out what V.F.D is and if one of there parents are still alive. But there is also a problem. there is no way out of the hinter lands which is a big desert and must stay disguised until there problems are solved.I like how the author makes every ending sad and explains their feelings well.
4,"A wonderful book, best of the series!","As the title says, another wonderful book by Lemony Snicket! As the Baudlaire orphans try to escape a fire in a villin's trunk, they discover how he has found out where they have gone each time.They disguise thmselves as two-headed freaks and Chabo The wolf baby.As this story continues,the children work at the carnival that they have arrived in,Sunny learns to make hot chocolate, and Violet and Klaus are chosen to be thrown into a pit of hungary lions! At the end, the Buadlaire's luck runs out as thier friends join Count Olaf,Sunny is babynapped, and Violet and Klaus tumble down a cliff. Beacause of the bad ending, i took of one star. A superior book for fans of the series!"
4,The Carnivorous Carnival,This is a great book for us kids under 13. I think this book is the best book of the series. It is way more exciting than all the other. Although this is a great book there are twists in the book it is a little confusing but at the end you will understand it. In this book there are new charecters and they make it cool and awesome too. I if you are thinking about buying it i think you should go right and buy it is so good. All of the things i told about this book you would be crazy not buy it.
5,Mr. Snicket's Best,"In the ninth installment of the Series of Unfortunate Events, The Carnivorous Carnival, Mr. Snicket leaves behind the basic kids get a new guardian, Count Olaf tries to get them once again outline of the first eight books. This is the first book in the series where the Baudelaires are guardianless. Instead, they find themselves stuck in a sinister plot involving Count Olaf and his troupe, an enigmatic fortune teller, and one damn creepy carnival. This book is quite well-written, and Tim Curry perfectly depicts the sinister quality on the book-on-tape version.I don't think that this book should be read until age eleven or so. The incident with the lions in the last couple of chapters will leave you feeling distinctly disturbed. I am going on thirteen, and I still cannot read this book at night. But for age eleven and up, or those of us under eleven who can handle the macabre, this is an excellent book."
1,responce to literture,"In the book The Series of Unfortunate Events The Carnivorous Carnival there are three children's names are Klaus, Sunny, and Violet. They are three children who are very unlucky and get into stuff they shouldn't get in to. Olaf captured the kids and what's to get the Baudelaire fortune. Violet, sunny, and Klaus find disguises and put them on. They dressed up like a two headed person and a bay wolf. Olaf finds out who they really are and tries to put them in a pit of hungry lions. Violet tries to escape but does it work read the book to find out. This book is very interesting and I think every one should read it."
1,"Repetitive, Boring, Lame","AHH, the Baudelaires are threatened to be killed by Count Olaf again! This has been the same plot for all nine books and it is SO BORING! For every book, Lemony Snicket has given readers the same problem: Klaus, Violet and Sunny are running away from their enemy and getting themselves in preposterous situations that would not really happen in every day life. This is because there is a little thing now I like to call ""child abuse laws"" and nobody could pull anything like Count Olaf and his troup. The situation is so bleak it is not even believable for a novel. It is like he is just pumping out novel after novel of the Series of Unfortunate Events just to make money and make people afraid of other evil people.YAWN..."
5,A successful gift to a 10 year old !!,I gave the Carnivorous Carnival as a birthday gift to a 10 year old boy whom I babysit. He loved it -- read it cover to cover with enthusiasm. So I pass along this successful gift book recommendation.
2,Nice idea; may not work for you,"The idea is nice but the ribbed surface doesn't work with many radiators - including our flat ones - and it's not easy to fill or clean. Essentially, a nice old idea that works if you have exactly the right radiator but even then doesn't put enough water in to the air to be worth the money. If you have numerous ones it might work well but then, they'd have to be priced differntly."
3,im intruiged despite the inconsistency * * * 1/2 stars,"i really want to like this group alot. The inventive and compelling keyboards,the ambient porudction, massive wall of sound guitars, but the band lacks in variety. Songs like ""goodbyes"" ""delta"" and ""sweet devotion"" and ""paradise"" are brilliant, while others like ""songs of a dead poet"" lag without the same kind of drive as the aformentioned. The atmospheric and inventive keyboard parts are good throughout so all in all im intruiged and wanting back for more"
3,Good if you have no basics at all,"Ok, so you're a business owner.If you're in marketing, skip this. This is too simplified, to general, not a place where you could find new ideas, or that many useful tips.Ok, small business owner. You want to know more about marketing. This may (or not) be the book for you. It claims at the introduction to be a very practical guide, with how-tos and ideas. To some extent, you'll have some ideas, and some preconceptions chewed up for you (like what NOT to give at a tradeshows, or tips on how to evaluate whether or not a tradeshow is justifiable ROI for your business).Would I read it at the library? It'd be more like a perusal. I would not read it word for word. I would suggest other alternatives, like a book called 101 marketing tricks (or something of the kind), because what you're looking for is ""how tos"", exact ideas you can implement, which this book is NOT."
3,Where's the middle ground?,"I originally picked up this book at the library along with a large stack of other books on professional wrestling in order to help me write a research paper. My biggest complaint was that most sections were so obscure that even the biggest wrestling fans would have trouble answering the questions. Other sections, however, were so ridiculously easy that my dad, who is a casual fan at best, was able to answer every one of them. It could have used another level of difficulty between the super easy and the super hard."
4,Excellent Indie Flick,"Picked this one up because of the cover art and didn't expect a lot. I was pleasantly surprised all around.The movie tells the tale of two very different people and the personal redemption they both eventually find while on the bare knuckle fight circuit.Chad Ortis does an excellent job as Michael Dublin, an amoral fight promoter who's only looking out for himself.Rebecca Neuenswander is outstanding as a very feisty Katherine Parker. She's got a bad attitude and something to prove. I really got invested in her character and the inner drive that motivated her to fight.If you're looking for a ""real"" fight, then rent a MMA dvd. If you want to be entertained for an hour and half, give this one a look."
2,A frustrating read.,"I just want to reiterate the reader review titled ""So much potential, so poorly realized"". This could have been a good book, but the author does get out of her own way.Frustrating and disappointing."
1,awful,"It's too bad that Eustace Conway's story had to be told by Elizabeth Gilbert. She's totally immature as a writer, and she doesn't know how to maintain any sort of distance from her subject. Last American Man reads like you'd expect it would, coming from a city gal who has a little romp in the woods with an outdoorsman. She is completely clueless. She retells Eustace's stories without skepticism. She quotes liberally from the work of Richard Slotkin, a hip scholar -- perhaps to bring some heft to this otherwise lightweight work. I travelled to Boone, N.C., shortly after the book came out and talked to folks who knew Eustace, had him in a class, etc. They thought the book was a laughable piece of trash, too -- a not-very-accurate picture of the man, and certainly not an accurate picture of that corner of Appalachia. Don't waste your time. (I notice that most of the reviewers here focus more on whether they like Eustace as a person, and not whether the book is any good. Which it's not.)"
2,"Mottly space opera, but good hard SF","On the plus side, this book is definitely hard SF with few fantasy elements. The technology is pretty well presented and basically plausible. Some of the technology seems to be based on the Kim Stanley Robinson series about Mars. The warstriders of the title are basically improved tanks that appear in many hard SF stories. However, though well described, they are not particularly central to the story.There are various minor negatives. Characterization is so-so, and it's hard to feel much involvement with any of the characters. Lots of the plot involves pretty peripheral stuff, and though it is well told, those parts could pretty much have been cut out without harming the main plotline of the story. The big negative is the ending, which is a real wimp out. Happy ending, but totally unlinked to the rest of the story, just an easy out.All in all, basically a book to painlessly kill a few hours."
2,"Have two pictured, only one is included in this price!","Yes it is a good handle, I was just upset when I orderd two, thinking I would get four handles and only recieved two. When there is clearly two pieces in the picture."
5,"Absolutely stunning, probably his best","This album is, without a doubt, one of the best live recordings I have ever heard. The songs are simple, stripped bare and beautiful, just Townes and his guitar -- I'm convinced it's the way they were meant to be performed; I've heard countless covers of Van Zandt's well-known classic Pancho and Lefty and nothing matches up to the original. The set list and quality of the recording is perfect, and the comments and jokes between songs are great as well.Best tracks: Pancho & Lefty, Mr. Mudd & Mr. Gold, Two Girls, Fraternity Blues, To Live is to Fly, For the Sake of the Song, Tower Song, Waiting Around to Die, Tecumseh Valley, Lungs."
2,only ok,"So, I decided not to buy this for my classroom. The horrible and awful things that happen in the story are genuinely awful (sexual and physical abuse, for example) and are never resolved or portrayed as as bad as they are. If the reader were from a background where these things had never happened to them the book could be read from a position of privelege and ignorance and could be enjoyed more than if read by a survivor who might just sit there struck by the protagonists' inaction. So, it was kind of fun, but I had this constant feeling as I was reading it that these kids should have gone out and done something about what was happening to them. This is not a book I would want to put in the hands of my students."
2,So Lemony Snicket is a real person?,"The first question that popped into my head was ""Is Lemony Snicket a real name or a pseudonym?"" The second was ""How would she sustain the misfortunes and make it a believable story?"" The first one is yet unanswered but the second became clear when I read ""The Bad Beginning."" Without the series title and the warning blurb, this is just your run-of-the-mill children's book. It thrives on conflicts that are mandatory anyway in any fictional work, and pretends that this banality is what makes it unique. Finally, when things seem to have been resolved towards the end, the villain escapes. Did anybody say, ""Scam""? It reads to me like the starting paragraph of the next book in the series. True enough, there have been at least ten books released.I would recommend you wait for the movie. This concept may be more successful in the cinematic form, and it would be a chance to see Jim Carrey monkey up again. As for the book, well, it's well-bound, but only literally."
2,not one of the greats,"I've read reviews comparing the author to Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl (Gorey makes the most sense, especially since the gothic background and language seems at times an homage to, at times a a rip-off of, the past master's work). I found the books in the ""unfortunate events"" series to be, for the most part, like a day-old cookie or pre-opened soda. Looks promising, but ends up tasting stale and flat. There's just something missing that greats like Gorey and Dahl never lacked - let's call it warmth. What made Edward Gorey a classic author was not merely his use of the gothic or the grotesque, but the understated humor, the heart, with which he described his characters' pitfalls. One feels no such warmth within these books. Cynicism and sarcasm alone are fun, but they ultimately make for a thin read; the classics, the truly great books, have more substance than evidenced by this series so far."
5,Sad,This book is very sad but I love it! Lemony Snickett is talented and the ending begs me to by the next book
1,Yuck! Gag!,"This book was horrible. Boring, slow, the characters were 2 dementional, the villin was not the kind you love to hate but as stupid and as meaningless as all the rest of the characters. The Characters were sappy and clingy and didn't quite cach on. The plot was dull and the words in between were meaningless. Honestly I don't know how this book caught on. This book was so horrible it could become on of those ""great novels!"" the your teacher makes you read! If i could give this novel a half of star i would. Don't waste your money. As you can probably tell, i don't take reading a bad novel very well-espeally when so many people rave about it. Read J k rowling instead."
1,A disturbing and possibly dangerous book,"I agree completely with the review of A Reader from Los Altos -- I read this book and was deeply troubled at the message it sends kids. Specifically, it tells them that their parents and other adults are entitled to do ""whatever they want"" to kids, including life-threatening physical abuse and sexual abuse, and that no one can or will intervene. Even a judge is shown as powerless to intervene and help the kids. If a child is being abused, especially sexually abused, it is very difficult for the child to confide that to an adult and get help. Why in the world, then, would a children's book author give kids the message that if they do confide in an adult, they will not be helped -- and will, in fact, be told that the abusing adult has the right to do so? For the first time in my life, I am thinking about physically destroying a book, so that my copy at least will not be read by any children."
4,Fortunately a Good Read,Why my daughter and I enjoyed reading about bad luck that happens time after time to the unlucky Beaudelaires is beyond me - but we did. Each of the seven books in the series so far has similarities but enough unpredictability to make each book worth reading. Violet and Klaus are likeable and empathy-inspiring characters.
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","I loved the idea of unhappy-ending stories for kids. The books look gorgeous, the illustrations are lovely, the children have the potential to be interesting -- but I can't bring myself to care that much about the main characters. The character of the baby, Sunny, is especially unconvincing. The writing style teeters between funny and pretentious, but mostly ends up on the pretentious side. I found the explanations of word meanings annoying and patronising, although I'm an adult so maybe my opinion shouldn't count. Perhaps a child would find the definitions useful, but most unfamiliar words can be worked out from the context, and those that can't can be looked up in a dictionary. I think the concept has potential, but I was disappointed with the execution in this instance."
2,A bad book,"My first impression of Mr. ""Snicket's"" book was pretentious-the word ""pretentious"" here means very, very proud. His gimmacks and tricks quickly became tiresome as I found myself bothered by his silly interuptions with definitions and all the insights he imparts. It's obvious his gimmacks were a smoke-screen to cover up the fact that he had little story.I did find the orphans sympathetic, but the other characters were one-dimensional at best. I suppose that the children collectively were the protagonist, but I never really felt connected to any of them.What disturbed me the most were some of the implications of a child bride and an infant being in danger. I understand Nickelodeon picked up the movie rights. I hope they are careful."
4,good book,"this book i was recomended by my little cousin who is 9 years old. i started to read this book because i was bored and i thought it would be a childish book, but it is not although i would not recomend this book to anyone over the age of 13 i read all the books and absolutely loved them they are full of awesome adventures"
4,An OK book in an AMAZING Series,"OK, so maybe it wasn't as good as the Ersatz Elevator, or the Reptile Room, or the Wide Window, but it was still an A- book!The start of the series most likely is the worse, but still good. This book is the shortest, so I'd reccomend it to a little kid whose just started reading fine realistic fiction, or a person who just wants to read a new series of books to have something to read. This series is definately better if you read it in order, but it's still good if you don't. I myself read the books in this order-3,9,4,5,10,1,2,6,7,8. Basically, I'd reccomend this book to any teachers wanting their kids learning new words and phrases (Snicket is very good at that), and also for people who want a very funny book.hope this helped"
1,This book totally SUCKS,"I have to say that this is absolutely the worst piece of literature i ever read. This is NOT HOW REAL KIDS ACT. First of all they would have resorted to violence, there must have been an assortment of tools they could have used to knock him unconcious with. Or they could have, I don't know, RUN AWAY. They're millionaires after a while of refusing to go back they would put them some place else. There are so many ways that this book could have been different and make it ACTUALLY GOOD and worth reading. But other then that just picture three really idiotic kids, make them do all the stupidest things possible and not trying to save their own lives, I think it was more like a book about suicide then anything else."
3,The bad beginning,"The series of unfortunate events #1. The bad beginning By:Lemony SnicketSunny, Violet, Klaus loses their parents in a fire. luckily the children got cut soon enough. They lived with a relative named Count Olaf. He was terrible and all he wanted was their great fortune. Count Olaf tried marring Violet, but she was too, Smart. Count Olaf gets away. The Bauldelaire's go back to living with Mr. Poe."
4,The unhappy ending,"""The Bad Beginning"" by Lemony Snicket is a dark and exciting book of unfortunate events. There are five main characters :Mr. Poe, Klaus, Violet, Sunny, and Count Olaf. This is a fantasy tale.Violet, Sunny and Klaus are orphans who have a huge fortune of money. Their guardian, the evil Count Olaf is after their fortune. He plans to trick Violet into marrying him in a play, and getting her to sign an actual marriage document. He plans to kill them once he gets the signature. So he can get all the money. Struggling through his treacherous plan, the orphans manage to turn the tables on him and keep their money.I would recommend this book because it is really exciting, sometimes scary and was well thought out. If you like dark stories, you will love this book. Many unexpected events happen in this book. Well, I'm telling you, this book is pretty good!"
2,An ok book,"When I saw the movie I thought it would have been a good series of books. But after I read the book I thought it was a horrible book.The beginning of the book was really boring, so I skipped on to the 2nd chapter and it became some what interesting. There was some action and fantasy at that point of the book.The most interesting part was when Sonny, Violet and Claude got left on the train tracks by Count Olaf. They had to make a slingshot out of some odd objects. They used a toy, a spring from the car seat, and a string from Sonny's shoe. The they shoot it at the levee so that the train would switch tracks and it would not hit them.They were able to call the officer, get away from the crazy Count Olaf and go live with their grandma.The ending was ok. They could of done a little better job if they would have keep the action going strong to convince people to read the series.If I was to rate it from 1 to 10, I would have to give it 4.(...)"
4,The Bad Beginning By Lemony Snicket,"In this book three children try to escape their evil relitive. Also in this book they have many problems to deal with. They have people who they trust and some they don't. When their relitive trys to marry the oldest child, they try to stop him. Do you think they will stop their relitive in time? If you don't believe anything I just said, read the book and find out for yourself."
3,Got my hopes up too far,"The premise is certainly attractive: three siblings, cast adrift in the world, surrounded by malevolent forces. And the grown-ups won't listen.The style just never engaged me, though. The little asides to explain what words meant - they just looked patronizing. There was lots more, like what's with the eyes? I hoped the author would at least give us a clue, but no. They're weird, they appear around that one individual, then he runs off.Harry Potter set the bar pretty high. I can't expect every writer to reach that level, but I can still be disappointed when they don't. The series has become so popular that there must be something in there that I'm just not getting. After reading this book, though, I'm just not tempted to hunt it down.//wiredweird"
3,"Not bad, fun if you like dark fiction","I personally have a hard time with this series, but am determined to get through it - mostly by repeating to myself ""well, how do the orphans get out of it this time?""This is the first book, in which the Baudelaire children are orphaned (a word which here means ""left on their own because their parents died in a horrible nasty house fire"") and sent to live with the first closest (geographically, at least) relative in a string of them: Count Olaf."
4,The Bad Beginning,"It was dark, haunting, mysterious and witty. Lemony Snicket has a talent. It had all the element of a great book and it was a book that was easy to read in one sitting.There some aspects of the book that were a bit disturbing, but I held on to every word until I was finished.The characters were very different and all unique. Count Olaf truly did have a streak of evil in him, The Baudelaire were ingenious.The plot wasn't lacking at all. It was extremely thorough and interesting. There wasn't just one conflict, but many. This book definitely kept your mind busy, easily distracting you from the core problem at hand.This is an incredible beginning and you will not want to miss it."
1,"Like Dubya, ""Lemony Snicket"" Happens","""Lemony Snicket"" (surely a pseudonym) has written a book that I would not want my children to read. Not because of (...) or violence, but because it is a lousy book, poorly written with a poorly contrived plot that is an insult to the reader. The author further insults the reader by talking down to him or her, with frequent interruptions to explain the meaning of words used. Perhaps the intended audience consists of children with no access to a dictionary; but if so, why not be consistent and define ALL polysyllabic words used?I was looking for a book to give it to my nephew for Christmas, and he has already read all five of the delightfulHarry Potter Box set Books 1-7(5 stars each), but I wouldn't offer this junk to any intelligent child.watziznaym@gmail.com"
2,Bad Beginning,"This book begins a series with its own style, different from the typical childrens book. However, this first one is not wonderful. It was not very funny, the characters were flat, the story just fails to capture the way I expected. It seems like Lemony Snicket used this book to develope this style of writing. His next few books are better, though, and go on improving as you go."
5,6th Book in a Great Series,The Ersatz Elevator is a great book because I like to see if kids escape from a evil villian and to see what kind of stuff they do to get away and if the villian escapes! This book is about a 14 year old girl who likes to invent a bunch of stuff who has a 12 year old brother who has read more books than a normal ADULT who has a baby sister with 4 sharp teeth and likes to bite stuff. These kids parents died in a fire and left them a huge fortune and villian who tries to steal it. These kids get stuck in a 38 story building with their friends in an elevator shaft. This is certainly Lemony Snicket's best book so far. This book is best for ages 10-15.
2,series,"The first book in the series, by far the most boring.This is the introduction to a great series, so don't be turned down if you fall asleep in the middle. The scheme made it so that I was alittle nervous to read this to others and I thought alot of it seemed alittlle more adult than something for a child any younger than junior high."
4,Worthy,I think that this book is very exciting and original. It is a educational book even! It is really a pleasent (or unpleasent) family book! I do hope that people of all ages can read it together!
2,"well-written,but weird","i read this book awhile ago(like,2-3 years ago)and while i have to complement lemony snicket on his creativity and imagination,i think that this was the weirdest dark yet comical book that i ever read. it just gives you and icky, uncozy feeling.i also hate terms like ""book the 1st"" or ""book the 2nd"".(i wonder what this guy's like at home)"
1,Horrible book. I cannot believe it was published.,"If you love children, or even like them a little, do not read this book. If you choose to, read with caution."
5,I Love Them all,"This book is a black comedy for children. Along the lines of Creepy Susan. Amusing and funny I can hardley wait for the new books to come out. I have read them all in order and I adore them. They are a great time filler while waiting for the next Potter book. This book series is a bit dim,but with light edge. I recommend it to middle readers only though unless being read by a parent. Some small children may feel scared when the book's childrens parents die. Dont worry I gave nothing away. good luck and good reading"
2,Maybe it would be OK for a 3rd grader...,"The Bad Beginning... well, it wasn't just a bad beginning. The whole time I was reading it I looked for the book to start getting better and it never did. Sure the age level is 9-12 and I am 15, but I have read reviews that said older children and adults would love it too. Lies. Maybe if you were my age and had a reading level of a 10 year old. Then it may have been ok. The overall idea of the story was good I thought, no happy endings. But the way the author wrote the book. I just really disliked the way the it was written and it was a waste of the 1/2 hour it took for me to read it all. I will not be reading any more of these books. And about some people comparing ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" to Harry Potter! Please. Don't waste your time on this book if you are older than 12. Read Harry Potter of LOTR. Thank You."
3,Not sure yet.,"Reading the back of the book and other reviews, I was a little skeptical. Why would I, let alone a child, want to read such a depressing story? But it is popular so I figured I'd give it a shot.I was definitely pulled in by the writing. I loved the definitions provided in the text by Mr. Snicket. The writing moved the story along but allowed me to stop and think without losing momentum.The story worried me a little - what message are we sending to children? These kids were on their own with no reasonable adult paying attention to their dire situation. But, I felt better by the end. The story strongly demonstrated values such as responsibility to your family and resourcefulness in solving your problems.Overall, I thought it was a very well written book that would get children thinking and entertain them. I'm still not sure about the content matter. I'm hoping the subsequent books will win me over completely."
2,unfortunate seires of events,"how long can you drag these books out for? they're all the same, the kids gets sent somewhere, to an evil guardian. but they always escape without any adult help, because they are never beleived. different adults but the same old song and it needs to be changed."
4,"Wits, charm and Unfortunate Events","This book and the entire series that follows are unusual in many ways. The most noticable one is that there's no happy ending, so don't expect any. Every book seems to end with the misrable siblings escaping yet another plot to kill them and steal their fortune. Nevertheless, the books are awsome. Lemony Snicket's excellent sense of humor should also be noted. Mostly subtle and unobtrusive, but very very funny.A word of warning though- the first 7 books are fantastic. Intriguing, funny and leaving you wanting more. But it all goes downhill from there, when the 12th book, the last one out in the date this review was written, is confusing and disappointing. I'm going to read the last book in the series when it comes out because I don't like leaving things unfinished, but I don't have high expectations. In short- read, enjoy, and if you get bored, just drop it. Don't wait for a conclusion because there isn't any (that's my guess, anyway)."
5,a great read,this book was great the author put his own thougts and voice into the story this book was one of the books i have ever read because it is different most books have happy endings which i think are boring because most books have happy endings this book left me wanting more like agreat book should
5,Best book ever!!,"This book has not just a bad ending but a bad beginning. So, if you only like books with happy endings, I do not recommend you this one. Though, if you like sad and mysterious books, I recommend this book to you^^ I hope you like it cause I loved it. After I started reading this book, I couldn't stop."
4,mmmhmmm,"i am, and have been a pretty devoted fan to the series....i've read 1-9...and was unaware that 10 had already hit book stores, but nonetheless, i think this is a great book for young children. lemony snickett tells his stories in such a deep, strong tone, one can't help but find his style humorous. i believe that this book is for younger children, but it is an enjoyable read to a person of any age."
2,Aimed squarely at young readers unlike Harry Potter,"I cannot comment on this book from the POV of a child, as I am an adult. A child might like this book ... quite frankly I don't know. This book received some attention when it was written as a book that was encouraging children to read, along with the more clever and entertaining Harry Potter series. Unfortunately this book, unlike Harry Potter, was written exclusively for young readers and has very little to offer to anyone older than 12. The plot is implausible (and rather disturbing with the pedophilic overtones) and the author's didactic (and pedantic) writing style is distracting and, quite frankly, annoying. You will be disappointed in this title if you have any expectations that it might rival Harry Potter. If you are a child who doesn't know any better and need to choose between reading and watching television, this might be a better choice."
1,I did not like this book,"I read the first few chapters and lost more interest the farther I read.... Not my cup of tea. The Bad Beginning, Middle and End"
4,Lemony Snicket??,"The whole series is cute and well written, but that's not surprising if you know who Lemony Snicket is. Lemony Snicket is an unpublicized alias for J.K. Rowling. That's very true."
4,REVIEW BYLORAINE LILES,I DID ENJOY THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. I AM LOOOKING FORWard to READING MORE about the orphans and their woes.
4,Good book,I read this book years ago but i don't remember any of that happening. But it was very good book.
1,Trash it.,"I just finished this book, which I read since someone recommended it to my son and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I am a fan of children's books and read them often... I do have an imagination, but I hated this book. I did like the writer's style and some of the characters, however cannot comprehend why people would find the abuse of children entertaining. If you want to read about clever children escaping danger and strange predicaments, I recommend the Spiderwick Chronicles. There is adventure, good characters, and no child abuse... I would not want to pass it along to anyone."
1,Disappointing,"As a general fan of teen fantasy literature (I love Harry Potter, mostly), I had high hopes for this series. I should not have wasted my time, and instead should have heeded the warning at the beginning of the book: it's just not good."
1,"One Huge ""Unfortunate"" Event","Take the book's warnings very seriously - there is nothing happy or pleasant about this book. My 7 year old was extremely upset after the first two chapters, in which the main characters are orphaned. I then ""read ahead"" to check on the children's adventures, reassuring my son that, of course, interesting things would follow. I read the whole, miserable story trying to find a spark of something that would interest a child. We love the Harry Potter books which, while sometimes dark, are full of fantastic adventures. This book has little of that adventure. While some adults may appreciate the book's tongue in cheek tone, I did not, and would certainly not continue reading this book to my children."
2,Badly Written Bad Concept,"Sorry, Lemony Snicket, but this book is a depressing read, (as it suggests on the back), and that is not covered up by the poor attempts at humor. The book has constant interruptions by the author defining words, and it is a quick read. I have 2 other books in the series, and I have to say that while they were a small improvenment, this is not the series to buy."
5,I would give this book a 5 star rating because it is interesting,And exciting. I especially liked the characters in the bookI really liked Count Olaf and Mr.Poe and Sunny .sWord's
1,Ripoff,"This may be a good movie but one's enjoyment of it is destroyed by the transfer. I don't know about the USA but Britain has consumer protection laws as does Australia & Canada. Dvds of such appalling quality as this should not be allowed to be sold. This is worse than the worst pirated videos I've seen. I'm not blaming Amazon, but why isn't this Koch transfer in the same legal class as pirated videos? People shouldn't be allowed to charge people for such a product. I haven't seen such terrible video resolution since 1st generation mobile phone videos! I'm binning my copy as I wouldn't inflict in on anyone else"
3,Where's the color??? Where're the subtitles??,I've got a copy of the French DVD release of this film. The color is gorgeous--bright and rich--and the aspect ratio is shown in its correct wide-screen format. It looks and sounds great. But there are no English subtitles. I don't know French but having seen the absolutely horrible b/w dubbed version others describe here (and they describe it correctly) I knew the plot and was somewhat familiar with the dialogue. I'm surprised someone hasn't taken the French release and provide it with subtitles.I give the b/w dubbed release a three-star rating because the plot is fun and the interaction between the characters shows Brigitte at her best onscreen.
3,It was ok,"I was an OK movie. The story was weak and the music left a bit to desired. I can see why it was free. If I had to pay to watch it, I would not ave been happy. Like I said, it is OK to watch, but you wouldn't be missing anything if you passed this one up."
4,Alpha and Omega,Alpha & Omega movie. I bought this movie for my granddaughter and she enjoyed the movie and the characters very much.
2,"Boring, even for a 4-year old","I've taken my 4-year old son to several movies (Toy Story 3, Princess and the Frog, Mega Mind, Despicable Me) and he's loved every one of them except for this one. He was bored with this one. There's not much in it to entertain adults either. There are better choices out there, folks. This movie earned a second star from me only because the animation and 3-D effects were pretty good."
1,Horrible waste of time,"I consider all the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movies monstrosities. I think the el cheapo sequels to Disney movies are a complete waste of a blank DVD and I HATE straight to DVD TV specials. They have many common negatives - terrible dialogue, dumb plots and cheap animation. Alpha and Omega TAKES THE CAKE. This is the first movie review I've done on Amazon because I feel so strongly about how terrible this movie was. It was not my choice, I wanted to rent Despicable Me from Redbox, but I listened to my kids and decided to give it a chance. It was the worst children's movie I have ever seen. Unrelateable characters, stupid storyline, un-entertaining dialogue and odd, out-of-place insinuations for a children's movie. It's so bad I'm feeling a little ashamed I've spent the past 5 minutes typing up a review. I guess I figured I might save some unsuspecting parent from having to endure the worst hour and fifteen minutes of time in front of the TV they will ever spend."
3,Ok,"Not sure this movie is appropriate for all audience, my four year old was asking a lot of questions after watching"
1,Don't waste your time.,"The storyline is boring, jumps around, and the quality isn't top notch neither. Perhaps it's me, I didn't enjoy it. But since I was the only one in the room still watching it, I would say the rest of the family didn't like it either."
2,BLAND MOVIE . . . SO TERRIBLY BLAND,A trite tale that doesn't deliver too much. The theme about the opposites attracting (compared to finding a mate just like yourself) is compelling and rings true but they only deliver it in the most simplistic manner. Kids may be more forgiving than adults when it comes to the story. I would expect nothing more than a mediocre to average experience with this movie. MY GRADE: C to C plus; WHEN WATCHED: 1/18/2011; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; HUMOR: C minus to C.
5,A new take on Verse Anthems,"I just listened to this compilation for the first time, expecting to hear another re-hashing of these beloved tunes done by a fine ensemble (and completely devoid of character!). However, this is not the typical domesticated Men and Boys rendetion you might be accustomed to.Red Byrd utilizes not only pronunciation appropriate to the period, but sings these pieces in a manner more like shaped note American tunes. It is, at first, a bit off-putting. However if one bears with it the pieces spring to life in a new way. In no piece is this more striking than ""This is the Record of John"". The rendetion heard here of the solo line becomes less pious and righteous, and a bit more tongue in cheek with John's repeated ""no"" answer to the questions asked of him by the Temple elders.A must! I know of no other disk quite like this."
5,GREAT CD FROM AN OLD LOYAL MASS FAN !,"this CD is sooooooo funny! these guys beat howard stern! when they were in boston i was a loyal fan, the best!!!! they were so bad they were kicked off boston airwaves... now, they are in NY.. i was just in NY to listen to them, and they are even better!!! i reccomend this CD for a good laugh!"
3,Has it's moments,"The demented world CD is dated now. In fact it's been probably been at least five years since I last listened to any of the tracks. It's kind of funny at times, but nothing great. This is not a reflection of the radio show that currently runs on XM Channel 105. The show now is much more evolved and spends more time talking about current events and having heated debates on real issues, and less on seventh grade humor."
5,This albumn provides tons of laughs.,If you like the jerky boys you will love this cd.This albumn not only has phone pranks but also has comedy bits that are hysterical.I recommend this c.d. to anyone that has a sense of humor or someone that wants one.
4,U have to read the other books first,I luved this book but i would say that read the other books first.its sorta hard roof understand without full.knowledge about what's goin on.
4,Hmm...,"Really interesting...After a while, everything gets to be too predictable, but it's cool. It gets you thinking about loads of stuff.(What's the secret to VFD? What happened to the Quagmires?etc.) Can't wait to see how the series will end."
4,I recommend this book,"I like Lemony Snicket's books because they are full of suspense. For instance, at the end of The Hostile Hospital they are in their enemy's car trunk! I believe the mysterious Beatrice is the Baudelaire's mother. Compared with Harry Potter, it is sadder because bad things keep happening to the Baudelaires but the stories are still very exciting."
5,*insert unfortunate pun here*,"ok,this one doesn't begin with the orphans getting a guardian,it starts directly from where the last one ended, and they all do that from here on.This one has a pretty dark story. If Klaus and Sunny don't do something,Violet's head is gonna be CHOPPED! ouch!Count Olaf is pretty cool in this one,because his disguise is,well.......a radio....lets call it thatIn the end, BAM! fire! fire everywhere! its crazy! Its awesome! its out of control!One of my favorite's!"
5,the hostile hospital,I like this book because its about three talented kids.one likes to read the other one likes to invent stuff the last one likes to bite things.Vilot Clous and Sunny are running from the police because this guy named count olaf blamed them for merder.they run and get on a v.f.d van and you will have to read the book....
4,The Hostile Hostpital,The Baudlaires are acussed of murder and are running from the cops in the middle of no where. They get in a van with V.F.D. singers. They go to a hostpital and work in the Library of Records and find out something out about themselves they didn't know... Read the book to find out.
4,hostile hospital,"On the run from Count Olaf and false accusations that they are murderers, the Baudelaire orphans disguise themselves as hospital volunteers and take a job filing in the hospital basement. Unsurprisingly, Count Olaf catches up, this time disguised as a surgeon he decides to give Violet what could be a fatal operation. Full of wordplay like the rest of his books, Snicket's latest never wavers in its suspenseful tale."
4,Suspension attacks all day when I read this!,Bravo. I must say bravo. This was so far the greatest yet o this series read it is my recommendation
4,"Great, Not Perfect Though","This book was just like the rest of the series - intense, vivid, and funny. But it also was, in my taste, very boring in the beginning. I think Lemony Snicket (phoney name) really makes the beginning too drug out and dull. But once you get to about the 100th page, you start to get into it, and your glad you put yourself through the boredrom. I think you should give the book a chance, just dont give up too quickly if it's not what you expect - it will be."
2,Tony has been tamed,"Wild T's new CD TRUE BLISS did not bliss me out at all. I found his previous 2 CDs (Love Crazy and Givin Blood) to be of true guitar greatness. I found that the primary reason is for the lightweight keyboards. Tony should have stuck to being a power trio. I sometimes wonder that after such a long gap from his last CD, maybe Tony wanted to appeal to more of a mainstream market and sell more CDs? Sorry Tony, this aint the one. I would have released the CD under the name TONY SPRINGER and NOT WILD T. So many songs are just lightweight RnB. God! Luther VanDross and George Benson spring to mind at times. Wild T has also re-released the song Cant getcha out of my mind featuring Jeff Healy. What this CD needed is more guitar frenzy. If he was to do a re-release of a song, I would have suggested Freedom Train, Love Crazy, I'm a River, Mean Mean Mama etc.C'mon Wild T - MORE ROCK needed"
1,Hardly worth your time,"If there was such a thing as a pre-alpha release of a book then, this is it. Granted, at the time its writing WSE 2.0 was in pre-beta, but the author could have covered lots of material to make the book worth it's sticker price by explaining the concepts behind the WS-* standards.In my opinion, this book is work in progress. You would be better of spending your time on MSDN."
4,Intriguing Exotic Romance,"This tale really held my interest over a period of several months. That sounds weird, but it was my ""car book"" that I read when stuck in rush hour traffic. I love adventure romances set in unusual places and this fit the bill."
5,Breathe cleanly with this mask in very dusty environments,This is the only mask that I will use for keeping the nasty dusts out of my lungs and sinuses. My wife MUST use this mask also as it prevents the molds from tripping her breathing problems. The outlet valve keeps the hot exhaust air going out of the mask.
4,"Not good for H1N1, good for other things","We had these in case one of us got sick with H1N1 and we had to prevent the other one from getting sick. Well, I got the flu. We bought these because of the ""easy to wear for long periods of time"" claim. However, we didn't realize that the ""valve"" was actually a flap that opens when you exhale. Not exactly effective in preventing my germs from getting out in the open when I cough. I should have thought harder about what a ""valve"" meant, but I was just going off the comfortablility claims rather than what that actually meant. I believe they added the ""Sanding"" description sometime after I bought it last spring.I could understand how they would work well in wood working, but in the virus area, get a traditional N95 without the valve."
5,excellent protection,"I was limping along with the minimal mask protection, and I read about this online. I ordered a box of them from Amazon, and now they're standard equipment for me for any project involving fumes, dust or flying artifact. My upper respiratory is kind of sensitive, so it's totally worth it to me to have effective protection. They fit, do not inhibit breathing at all, and last a long time. Given these qualities, they're a good value."
4,very useful,"As soon as recieve the package,I put the respirator on.And breathing is not a problem when I equip it on the right way,but I think it still hard to breathing for my grandma when she wear it."
5,"Good masks, great price",These masks work great for use inside a hog barn. I use them daily and can usually get more than 2 weeks out of them. The price seems to fluctuate anywhere from $1.14 to $1.62 each.
3,"Great, But...","This album, ""Miss Gloria Lynne,"" is typical great, sterling Miss Lynne in all her fine vocal form.I have but one complaint, or caution, for those thinking of purchasing this album. The accompaniment here is nearly all organ.This is fine for lovers of organ, but others may be surprised that it's not her usual accompaniment of piano, bass, drums.There are a smattering of other instruments here, such as saxophone and guitar.This would be a four star recording to me. I just don't like organ, so I have to drop it down to three.---"
4,B. Tate,"I have enjoyed all of the Left Behind books, and I also enjoyed the prequals as well. Although the books are fiction, they have Biblical truths that people should not ignore. I truly believe we are living in the end times and the books bring to life the coming events of history. I have come to regard the characters in the books as friends and have read with excitement all they have gone through on their journey. The authors have a wonderful understanding of the Scriptures and have presented them to us in an exciting and wonderful description of what we can look forward to. I will miss them."
1,kool-aid stock is soaring,"I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is ""DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."""
3,The Rapture,"It's a good book, but it's a little slow. I've sat it down a couple opf times already to read something else. I'm sure I will finish it sometime. Just check it out at the library, it's not worth the money of a purchase."
4,Very fun game!,"I really love this game! It took a few to get used to it's version of racing physics, but once I started to get it, it started to get more fun for me. I imagine that a wheel setup would be very good for this game, but I'm just not that much into gaming to have/want one.All (most) of the cars stear/handle/sound quite different, as opposed to other racing games where only the cars skin changes. Some cars are better for some tracks (as in reality), and it's a pretty neat challenge finding which cars react best on a track.The only drawback that I've seen is the VERY annoying requirement of unlocking/collecting cars/tracks. I like the ability to cheat in games, and this doesn't allow you to...but that's the only drawback I see."
5,GREAT VALUE,shower head and hose quality are very good for the low price. different water flows make it good for washing hair and massaging the shoulders....well worth it.
1,"Shower head great ... design as a whole ""no good""","I purchased this item, installed it...used it 3 times and on the third use the swivel unit that allows the handheld to move when in the holder popped out.Its a molded ball joint setup that when assessing it after it broke looks to me like it will happen to all of the units eventually with use(wear)...They could improve the design by making the ball joint part a two piece screw together setup so that the tension can be adjusted and this problem of the ball popping out does not occur...I returned the item for a refund as it could not be easily put back together... not the sellers fault... manufacturer issue..."
4,Dance Shoes,"Overall, these are good dance shoes. I just started ballroom dancing. I like the heel height, because to me they are not too high. They are pretty comfortable and I like the x-strap in the front because it helps the shoes stay on my feet. I got lots of complements from my dance class partners. I also got them for a good price so what's not to love."
3,"Compelling story from an interesting man, amateurly written","Mullen has certainly become a legendary figure in the skateboarding world. However, skateboarding with such dedication has apparently afforded him little opportunity to find his literary voice.This is a standard play-by-play autobiography, and the Mutt cuts an eccentric and striking figure. People interested in Mullen, his youth, and transitions in the waxing and waning skateboard industry will likely be satisfied. Mullen's treatment of living with anxiety is the most pleasant surprise found here, and written well.The problem with the book is that Mullen is not as skillful with his pen as he is with his board. His co-author could and should have guided the text a bit more. It's certainly readable, but lacks illustrative quality and is at times very elementary in style.Overall a good book, but I feel like it could've been better."
1,Editor Seriously Needed,"Just to reiterate what others have said, this book has so many errors it is difficult to trust it at any point at all. Whenever an author has trouble spelling ""OSPF"", (spelled ""OPSF"" numerous times) you know there are going to be other issues. I never write reviews, but felt it was my duty in this case to warn others. The material is difficult enough already without having to deal with this confusion."
5,Really Great Book,"This book is great, I got it for my Moral Devolopment class at school, and it really teaches the Catholic values strongly (abortion, death, etc.) I would definitley reccommended this book for a devout Catholic."
3,Not the best but certainly a must for Dylan lovers,"As a huge Dylan-fan (for over 40 years now) I collect almost every music played and/or written by Bob Dylan. Maria Muldaur sings with a wonderful voice 12 covers. Just relax and listen. Of course, there are better covers, but this album is worth buying it. Only one point of critism. Why weren't the songs ""Is your love in vain"" and ""Love minus zero/No limit"" not covered?"
5,Good summary of comtemporary moral issues.,Richard Sparks presents a summary of contemporary Catholic moral theology that is both traditional and contemporary. He addresses many pressing moral issues in a way that is faithful to Catholic teaching without sounding dogmatic. He also is very ecumenical in his approach which shows the common natue of Christian Morality on most issue (with major exceptions such as birth control etc.). It is an excellent resource for anyone who wants real answers to hard questions in a user friendly format.
5,Family Guy Star Wars Trilogy,"Love, love, love it. Great product that hits both my Star Wars and Family Guy cravings. Funny and interesting, especially Stewie as Darth Vader, very creative. Highly recommended for ani-maniacs."
3,"Words bad, story good.","I am getting increasingly tired of Snicket defining words and phrases as they have to do with his story instead of the true dictionary definition of the word. Besides that, the story was well executed.My favorite thing is that Snicket has decided to age his child characters. Often in series of books intended for children, they remain the same age for the duration of the series, (i.e. as far as I know the Babysitters Club is still 13 and in the 8th grade, and have been since I was 9--and I'm 27). It's nice when the children grow, as well as learn, (i.e. the Harry Potter characters). I'm glad Snicket has allowed the Beaudelaires to do this. It gives me hope that Violet will turn 18 prior to being captured successfully by Olaf."
4,Exciting and unfortunate!,"This book held my attention from the beginning to the end. Once I finished a chapter I didn't want to stop there. I have read from the first through the ninth books in this series. I intend to read the rest as well. I hope Lemony Snicket, the author, never stops creating additions to this series. Everyone should at least start the ""Unfortunate"" series because I think once they do, they will enjoy all of them as much as I have."
1,The Vile Village,"As a fan of the Series of Unfortunate Events, I was sincerely disappointed by this 7th installment. From beginning to end this book is dry and just overall not exciting. The character development is slim to none as the Baudelaires go on this adventure. The story winds on and on for 256 pages of bad writing and a distasteful plot. The reason why I found this plot unamusing is that it doesn't complete the story left by the 6th. This book was a terrible follow up to the superb writing and plot that was detailed in the 6th..In conclusion, I would not recommend wasting your time and money on this terrrible installment."
5,Great condition...,Received in great condition within the anticpated delivery time. Received periodic emails providing updates as to the delivery date. Great job Amazon!
1,not what I expected,"Did not fit like other Lee one-true-fit pants I had bought (much tighter) and were so low-cut I would have never worn them even if they did fit. I returned them and, of course, lost my shipping costs."
3,Mixed Bag,Expected Conduct is essentially a list of 142 pretty good rules for conducting yourself to get ahead in your carreer. Unfortunately the author has also seized the opportunity to express his contempt for humanity. Your best bet is to read enough on each rule to understand its meaning and skip the presumptuous explanatory opinion. Dilbert is funny. This author is not.
4,Becoming a Vessel of Honor,"Good book to read if you need reference in dealing with Satanists and those coming out of it. This is a helpful book that deals with the issues of born-again in Christ satanist. It gives you an idea what's out there, but also gives some info on how to deal with it."
5,Wrong Price for Quart!,"Price is much lower at True Value:Glazol, QT, Glazing Compound, Use For Wood Or Metal Sas$5.85Shopping Cart Glazol, QT, Glazing Compound, Use For Wood Or Metal Sas SKU: 550523 Glazol, QT, Glazing Compound, Use For Wood Or Metal Sashes, Setting Plumbing Fixtures & Filling Cracks Or Nail Holes, Superior To Putty, Use As A Knife Grade Caulking Compound, Remains Pliable, Will Not Chip Or Crack, Year Round Workability. UNITED GILSONITE LAB"
5,Great Product,"What could be easier than once a day tasteless liquid minerals? Just as recommended, they do work for me. Thank you"
1,Not a gaming book.,"Well, mainly, not. The real reason to pay this price for this book is because you'd like to read some short vignettes by unknown authors within a setting contrived for an RPG, not general fiction. I realize some of you like your White Wolf books that way, and you're welcome to them. I just found it monumentally frustrating that the book contains a small pamphlet's worth of actual information I can use, an none of the information I was really buying the book for. I feel I was deceived."
2,"Makes sense, didnt work for me","This product makes sense. It also makes sense for the chips they talk about for the computer in your car. But the best I was able to get was 1 mpg improvment. Not sure if it was the Tornado or the fact that I tuned it up with new plugs, distributor cap/rotor/spark plug wires, cleaned my K&N air filter as I did them all at the same time. Either way, my MPG was 12/16. Any type of improvement when gas is over $4.00 per gallon was an improvement in my book. I did notice a little better responsiveness in the pedal when in the lower 3 gears. SUV was a 2001 Dodge Durango SLT 5.9 liter 360 engine 4x4. So I guess with what size engine I have the gas mileage was good for improvment to 12/17. Driving style did not change."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to the release of this game. Not too many fishing sims have need released lately. Trophy Bass 4 is four years old, and it plays better than this game. The fish graphics are jerky and the fins sometimes disappear when passing in front of a rock or weeds. The look of the game is beautiful, but the play leaves something to be desired. It looks like 2004, but plays like 1999. The lure selection is limited compared to other games. The only high points are the 360-degree lure cam, and the fact you can use live bait (something other games do not offer)."
1,Repackaged 'reference guide' from manual set,"Sorry but adding some Kickstart info from the Customization guide and combining a few chapters into one doesn't really make this different then the Reference Guide I got with my software.The material is good enough but I would have appreciated a disclaimer somewhere that told me I was buying the Reference Guide printed in a bigger font. The sections were slightly rearranged and they stripped off the numbering so it doesn't look quite like a manual but the words are the same (ok so a couple of the chapter intros were re-written, big deal). Sorry but this doesn't make the grade in my book."
1,Beautiful piece!,"I recieved this statue in great timing. I was thrilled to get it. I opened the box and found it not as I hoped. The statue was apart from the base, and the base had a large crack all the way across the bottom and up the sides. It looked as if it was done this way before it was even shipped. I was distressed. The damage is done. I decided to keep it. Being so cheap, what can I expect! Disappointed, yes! But I will try and mend it and save it. At least they sent it fast, and it was wrapped up good."
2,Massey-Ferguson Book,Would have liked for it to be more like a shop manual. Hoped it would have been in more detail and informative.
5,anime soundtracks,"It is very enjoyable to hear ""real"" soundtrack music instead of rehashed pop tunes as background music. This was a requested purchase by my daughter. When you close your eyes and listen you can feel the emotions of the scene. We own all of the original soundtracks for ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" anime. You will find yourself playing it over and over and never getting bored."
4,A Slow Thoughtful Ride Through Regency England,"Midsummer Moon is a novel that is not fast paced,nor is it original in plot. Two things that normally would not send me running to the bookshelf. The author (Joy Reed), slowly pulls you into this story of ""Plain"" Jane and the ""foppish"" Sir George. I came to care about these characters and was sorry the book had to end. Truly a sign of a good book!"
2,Somewhat entertaining,"Maybe this is a good movie, but just not my style. I did like Armegedon. The plot of the movie was that the US found out that in 2 years and asteroid will strike Earth. The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't focus on the asteroid as much as it should. I would bet more that half of this movie had nothing to do with the asteroid. During this time, the movie focusses on the personal lives of the characters of the movie which really isn't that interesting. When the method of destroying the asteroid is discussed, it seems that it was thought up and planned by a 6th grade class. Also, I didn't find the way everyone reacted mostly acurate. So overall, if you have nothing better to do, you could rent this movie. But if you want to see a great movie about an asteroid, see Armegedon."
3,"Should have been titled ""Shallow Impact""","This film seems like an updated version of George Pal's ""When Worlds Collide""; only this time, mankind has sufficient technology to at least avoid the destruction of the earth. The earth inhabitants depicted in this film knew there was a good chance for the ending of mankind; but it didn't give them an excuse for letting the kids stay home from school or let them marry when they weren't old enough to drive or vote. Because of this, it could send the wrong message to minors. Good special effects were wasted in this movie with a mediocre screenplay and acting that really isn't the best."
2,"This movie is like Armageddon, minus the entertainment.","I'm sorry, but this is supposed to be a disaster movie? Since when does a disaster movie have the ""disaster"" in the sub-plot??? This movie is actually a love story between the (then) 18 year old Elijah WOod and 15 year old LeeLee Sobeiski. Nothing more, nothing less. You'll be eager to see the astronauts on their heroic mission, instead you'll be tormented by Elijah staring at LeeLee. This movie also disguisted me, for instance, the point of attack (when the actual movie's meat started) comes during a hyper-close up of a fat guy's cheek blubber shaking as he sloppily eats pizza. The camera is pretty much sitting on the guy's top lip for about six minutes before the guy looks at at screen and realizes an asteroid is about to hit. I give it two stars only because of a moving scene on a beach between a daughter and father."
4,Deep Impact,"A story well done, with good special effects. Characters are believable and given enough depth to carry the plot through to the end."
4,Deep Impact Hits Hard on Blu-ray!!!!,"Deep impact was one of the greatest disaster movies of the 90's. This 50GB AVC Mpeg 4 codec produces a crystal clear and vivid detailed version of this movie. From the trails of the blown up asteroid in the sky to the buildings collapsing, this is the blu-ray to own. Good job to Paramount for cleaning up this movie and for a great HD version as it was intended to be seen."
5,Old but NEW on Blu-Ray,"Loved watching this movie again but with the clarity of blu-ray well, it made it awesome to watch again. This product came on time if not earlier than I expected!"
3,ANOTHER SUMMER OF DOUBLE DISASTER MOVIES,"Does this sound familiar. Last year it was volcanoes. this year, asteroids. This movie made around $150 million at the box office. why? Because everyone was waiting for Armageddon. To be honest, I hated sitting at the movie theatre with 400 other people because I couldn't fall asleep. It wasn't so bad at home, but I still could have watched the first and last fifteen minutes and the movie would have been great. I do have one great thing to say about this movie. MIMI LEDER. She is going to be a powerhouse director very soon. So the movie wasn't a total flop thanks to Mimi."
1,Pathetic,"I thought Armageddon was bad, but compared to this hogwash it is a cinematic masterpiece. I hated the smug way this movie tried to disguise itself as something meaningful and philosophical... I mean, if you're going to make an adventure flick, MAKE one! And make it well, while you're at it. Forget the smug one liners, and PLEASE, for GOD'S sake, forget trying to teach us a life lesson. No matter how you look at it, Deep Impact is nothing more than another factory made, plotless, kindergarten-level scripted, American excuse for a movie. That's that."
2,Mediocre disaster film,"Deep Impact is nothing you haven't seen before. It's the typical lousy disaster film ( excluding Poseidon Adventure and Towering Inferno ). The relationships of the characters are typical stories of love found, love lost, and love found again. The performances are average, the script is dull, and the direction is subdued. What can you say about a film that tries to tell the audience that the coast of Virginia looks like the mountains of California? People were about a half an hour away from Virginia Beach when the asteroid hit, and they were able to run to the tops of mountains more than an hour away in ten minutes! That's what I call bad film making."
1,Extremely boring and bad,"The acting is awful, the story without any thrill... there is so much bad I could say about that movie, probably one of the worst I ever saw. I found it so bad and boring that I quit watching it in the middle after the anti-meteorite mission fails. BTW I wonder if there isn't (maybe unintended) some anti-African racism in it as an America depicted here with all top-leaders (president, etc.) being African fails to protect the planet whereas other movies of this kind show European national leaders succeed? I would not expect this from Hollywood though, so I guess it is unintended.Go and get instead a good comedy like Bulworth. At least you will have some fun, thrill, and food for thought."
2,Special Effects Good,"This movie had a few good actors in it but it wasn't enough to make up for the bad. Ta Leoni is terrible as the news caster and her father in the movie was down right bad. Only watch it for the special effects because other wise, it is just plain bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I got a good laugh out of it. It wasn't very dramatic either! Put it this way, I was hoping a meteor would really hit the earth after seeing this"
2,Canned corn in spades,"If you think that going to the market and buying canned corn will provide you a gourmet meal an hour later, then this is your film...and, boy, is it loaded with corn as well as sap and anything else that can be heaved into a movie to make it trite and cliche. Can't quite knock it down to a one star level since those sorts of movies are ""special"" in their own right but this one was pressing the boundaries. The ending scenes that were supposed to be so deep and emotional I kept on picturing as being a part of ""Airplane"" or ""Blazing Saddles"" and expected the actors to produce on screen a bottle of syrup in order to enhance the effect of their weeping."
4,Deep Impact,"Fun and motivating movie. If you like disaster movies, this one will fill the bill nicely."
4,Story & characters have more depth,"Contrary to its end-of-the-world contemporary film, Armageddon, Deep Impact is more realistic. In this film, no single individual emerges as a lead character or hero who saves the earth. All these great actors/actresses were given bits & pieces roles & they all have their own side stories. This set-up may not work in other films, but in this particular one, it was successful in enhancing each character & the role they play. It is also more serious, heartwarming & sensitive. & definitely, your eyes will not remain dry at the end of this film."
4,"Good movie, definately a buy.","I am tired of hearing ""get Armageddon instead""! Armageddon is a semi-plotless car commercial. The disgusting cue-waving-American flag scene made me want to growl. Tacky. Plotless. Very scientifically unaccurate. A rotating Mir? HA!Deep Impact has real human interaction. D.I. actually made me feel for the characters. A deeply moving plot. Go buy Deep Impact!"
5,Bright & Shiny,This is a high quality bug shield. Great price and fast delivery! You really can't go wrong purchasing this item.
4,Good Salsa From Denver???,"That's right I said Denver There are bands based out of the Bronx and NYC that don't even come close to these guys. Good Straight Salsa Dura NYC Style. A good job with To be with you, and other tracks. A little Latin Jazz thrown in for good measure and you have a good CD. I heard all the cds for this band are worth it. They remind me of the bands over here like Soneros Del Barrio and some of the cover bands we have here in NYC. You won't be disappointed!!!!!!"
2,not the original,This book doesn't live up to the original. The original had tales of children who learned to wantdo the right thing. This book just has stories about children who are tricked into good behavior. Not the same!
4,Sleepytime,"This is a great chill out album in that Nick Drake kind of indie rock style. It's not going to blow your mind or anything, but it's perfect for what it is. Just sit back and relax, light some candles, stare at the ceiling, get a back massage, have someone feed you grapes, then fall asleep on the couch and drool on the pillows. Works for me!"
3,It is not a Horror Movie,"Hey, I don't even know why they put this in the horror section..This film is about child abuse, not some made up film about a monster....It was hurtful...powerful...never trashy...And gave the victims in the film dignity...But no its a drama...not a horror movie"
1,david is one of them,david is one of the bad one. otherwise he could stop ruth and save young girl. david is resposible for this tregedy.
1,VERY SICK MOVIE!!,"I can't understand where the entertainment starts!! This is nothing but a torture movie!! Had to shut it off half way through. No reason for a movie like this, chances are if you enjoyed this movie your already a registered offender!!!"
1,THE GIRL NEXT DOOR,"EN ESTA PELICULA EL TEMA PRINCIPAL ES TOTALMENTE CORROMPER LA INOCENCIA DE LOS NIÑOS,LLENA DE CRUELDAD, TORTURA, EROTISMO A TEMPRANA EDAD, INSITA AL VICIO, AL MORVO, A LA CRUELDAD SEXUAL, HASTA LLEGAR AL ASECINATO.DEMACIADO CRUEL PROVABLEMENTE EXITE A LOS DEPRAVADOS SEXUALES O A LOS PEDOFILOS."
5,A very sad but true story.,If you love true stories this is the movie to get. It made you feel like you were actually there. The emotions of this movie were so true to life.This is a movie that will stick in your head the rest of your life.
2,weak stands,These speaker stands are smaller than regular stands and will not hold a set of 15 inch yamaha speakers without wobbling. Would not buy again!
2,what a waste!,"I,ve heard about this band and bought into the hype. It started off good with samples by Richard Pryor and Red Foxx but the second track where they actually play? music i was let down. I can honestly say that the music is awful! I dont mean to bash them to hard but, this music sounds like it was made by 12 year olds, dyi ethics, c,mon."
3,"Important, but...","I saw Barry MacSweeney at a poetry reading in Huddersfield, about 1998. He was a wreck that night, but a fascinating reader.His poetry is rambling, occasionally incoherent, repetitive, and rude, so it should come as no suprise that it is also fitfully very beautiful and true. The whole of ""Pearl"" is reproduced here, which is disappointing if you already possess it because it comprises at least a quarter of the book. The selection from his other numerous books and pamphlets should have been larger - for instance it contains very few early poems. Having said that, Bloodaxe have honoured an important and neglected man. The Collected will make an even more worthy investment of their time, and yours."
1,Horrible and missing pieces,I bought it and it sucks its missing pieces and it gave me a headache... grrr dont buy it if you want something fun and complete because mine is missing 4 pieces
1,Waste of time and money,"My daughter was very excited to get this toy and it turned out to be garbage. This has got to be one of the worst produced puzzle ever. The included instructions say to remove all pieces with red dots on them as they are ""unnecessary"". After spending an hour and and a half removing these puzzle pieces, as many of the red dot pieces were attached to ""good"" pieces, we ended up with a pile as big as the ""good"" pile! My daughter and I decided to try anyway, but after a while, it was clear there was something very wrong and we were missing a lot of pieces. The worst part of this experience was how disappointed my daughter was."
5,Restoring Your Shield of Faith,A Now Word for the church. Chuck Pierce and Robert Heidler are the authors to give us the Now Word. Easy to understand but pertinent information.
3,Book does not include Joel,"I bought this book especially for what it could offer on Joel 2 since I have to write a sermon on that passage. Even though the description says that the book includes Joel, there is nothing about the book of Joel in this book. I will keep this book and use it for the other prophets it does mention but i am disappointed with how it could leave out the prophet Joel"
5,Excellent Movie,I had looked for this movie for more than 20 years and was finally able to get my own copy. Melvyn Douglas and Gene Hackman are superb. It arrived in a timely fashion and is in excellent shape. I've watched it at least three times since I've had it.
1,DVD faulty,"I Never Sang for My FatherThis movie is recorded on demand. I ordered twice, disc ejected both copies. Why can't you have them check it before sending out?"
3,Another iPod charger,This is another little iPod charger that connects well with the other adapters I have for my iPod.
1,Never worked,It simply never worked and I didn't get around to returning it. (I don't have anything else but I'm required to type a minimum here.)
3,Time will tell,"I bought this not to charge the battery in an mp3 player, but torun it continuously. We have a Sandisk Sanza Clip player whichplays Music-on-hold into our PBX. It's a 24/7 operation so wedon't want to run on batteries. The last Ac adapter/chargerI bought lasted a little over a year, and cost a lot more.If this one lasts that long, it will be a deal, and I'llbuy a few of them next time. In this application, timeis the acid-test for quality. For now, it's working fine."
1,Doesn't work with 2nd gen Nano,"I debated a few days whether I should get it for my 2nd generation iPod Nano, but decided to go ahead and buy it since the price was much cheaper compared to other options. Sadly, this charger does not appear to work for my Nano (tried it both in the United States and Europe). It makes my Nano screen flicker and changes the tone of colors on the screen. It didn't destroy the iPod by just trying it, but I was too afraid to leave it charging for an extended period of time since the iPod started getting too warm and the screen was still flickering.The charger I received is slightly different from the one pictured. It is possible that some of these chargers work with 2nd gen nano and others don't."
4,worth it!!,This product is very useful when you're not near a computer and need to charge your iPod!! It is also great to carry around because of it's size.
4,Cheap USB wall wart,"This does what it's supposed to do, convert 110V AC into 5V DC via a usb port. I use it to run homemade LED spotlights for outdoor holiday decorations. My only complaint is that it does not fit tightly into a socket. It can be too easily unplugged. Other than that, it works fine."
3,does what is needed,It is a useful product except that it will take up more than one space in a surge protector. that is the biggest down side.
1,Defective on arrival,"This is a cheap and low quality product, and you're taking your chances as you may get a defective piece like I did."
1,broke after 5 months light use,Had for about five months before one of the electrical pin connector broke off into the house power outlet. I had to pull the pin out with pliers. Could have shocked someone.
1,caution buyers,"This charger fried 2 mp3 players, both less than 4 weeks old. A new Ipod touch stopped powering up after the first charge using this item. A cheaper mp3 player died after about a week of use. It worked for a few charges, then after plugging it in one day, I noticed the charging light on the player did not come on and it was extremely hot."
1,Misleading Ad for iPod Charger,"Advertisement indicates that this charger is for iPod Shuffle, Nano, etc. I ordered the charger, and after 3 weeks (which is another story), I received the device, but it did not charge my iPod Shuffle. I sent several e-mails to the company (inspiretech), and they finally agreed to send a replacement, and asked me to retract my negative rating. I recently received the replacement, and it also does not charge the Shuffle. After numerous attempts to contact inspiretech, no response. I guess they are done with me. Watch Out!!! THIS WILL NOT CHARGE AN iPOD SHUFFLE, regardless of what the ad says."
3,Worked well while it lasted,"I purchased this in March 2008. It worked well, even on a Blackberry, but it was short-lived. By November, it died, no longer charging."
1,Poor customer service.,"The item works great, the price unbeatable, but waiting over a week for a package that was ""lost in shopping"" and then waiting another week and a half for it to get here, and asking for a routing number and being DENIED said number, that was really uncool."
1,"Works, but....","It charged my RCA H100 with no problem. Hooking the mp3 player back up to the computer though failed. I got a ""unrecognized USB device"" message."
2,Does not work with devices that I have tried.,"This product seems to supply power to a usb port, but because it does not charge anything that I've used it for I have given this a rather low rating.I've tried charging an iPod, iPhone and HTC Incredible. As I said, it does transfer some sort of power from a 120v AC receptacle to a USB port. The only proof that I have of this is that the device does seem to power a cheap LED laptop keyboard light. But seeing as plugging a usb keyboard light into a wall socket or extension cord is rather impractical, I still can't give this product more than 2 stars. All three devices that I would need this product for say that the accessory is not supported."
4,How Bad Can a $5 iPod Charger Be?,"Even with shipping, this charger is only about $5. I was a little skeptical of it, but I figured that $5 was a decent gamble - it has paid off! I have had this for about nine months, and I use it all the time. It charges quickly (much more so than using my computer). Although it is not a thing of beauty (like Apple products are), it does the job and doesn't cost a lot. I gave it four stars instead of five because the price listed is somewhat disingenuous - it isn't $.99 when you factor in the shipping. Overall? This is a steal!"
2,Charger...,Broke in 2 weeks cheap for what you pay for. Although it gets the job done it wont last long.
3,Good enough,"The product looked nothing like the picture. I bought this for my and my sister's 4th gen iTouchs and it worked just fine. However, I gave mine to my sister after hers broke. I ended up getting two Apple brand chargers from a friend."
2,Buyer Beware,I just received my 2 units. The first thing I noticed is that these are not UL Listed devices. After reading other reviews I will not use these devices. I will purchase a more expensive model that is UL Listed.
1,Should of known it was cheap for a reason,"This wouldn't even charge my iPod what so ever. It would act as if it was charging and then 30 minutes later I would check and it would remain at the same battery life, sometimes even less battery life. Waste of money. Good thing it was cheap as hell."
1,USB/AC for MP3 Players-White,"This is the first time, I have got something doesn't work.Yes, that was what I paid for, but I needed it even I paid more shipping.The place like we live is so inconvenient that we have to depend on online shopping.And the company that sold it to me have no response at all.I was lucky that I didn't buy anything valuable."
2,Wall prongs fell out!,"This item worked well to connect our ipod to the wall to charge, or to connect our USB speakers to the wall and use them separately from the computer.However, with a small tug to the ipod cord, the unit pulled away from the wall and the prongs actually came out. Luckily they fell to the floor rather than staying in the wall, which could have been a disaster to get out.Buyer beware: cheap, but works if you're careful."
2,Prong broke off in my wall!,Everything was going fine until one day I unplugged it from the wall only to find a prong missing from the device. It had broken off in my wall! VERY cheaply made!
1,Never even got the product!,"Ordered in november, was told delivery by Dec 7, now its Christmas Eve and i have yet to get any information regarding the package. On my account I am able to ""track the Package"" but it says there is no information for it... Silly.It was only $3, but still, no product despite payment! Dont use this company"
2,"Funny if you're a Democrat, I guess","I laughed at some of these, but alot of them just came across as bitching disguised as humor. I mean, biting humor is supposed to be about humor, not about just flat out hostility towards the butt of your joke."
1,A Pack of Lies,"I suffered through this film, as a favor for a friend. I thought it would straighten me out on some issues, but it was just more Preterist deception. Read the Bible and follow the truth. This movie will lead you astray."
5,Great for fishing,"I needed a rain bib for a fishing trip up in Alaska, found these and they are perfect. Easy to put on and it has a pocket on the inside which is also water proof for storing your phone or wallet."
3,No stellar results yet...,"I purchased the Syflex Pets arthritis formula for my 6 1/2 year old Jack Russell Terrier, who has suffered from arthritis in one of his back knees for a few years now. The reviews were very encouraging and I felt that I had to give it a try. However, it's been nearly a month, and I haven't noticed much relief from his stiffness. There has certainly been a small amount of improvement, but he still favors his ""good"" hind leg and walks gingerly on the affected leg. I'm not sure if I should blame our frigid winter temps and continue with it, or save my $. I'm in a bind over what to do, because the company I purchased it from offers a 30-day money back guarantee. I noticed the most improvement during the first 10 days, when the product recommends doubling the dose. I'm temped to give my dog more than advised, but of course the repercussions worry me."
2,10+ yr old cat does not like the taste / don't see improvements,"we used ""people"" glucosamine on our dog with fabulous results, so when our 11 year old cat started having problems with her hips, we thought this would be beneficial to her as well.first, let me say that she does NOT like the taste of this glucosamine one bit. since the directions say to give her such a large amount, it's not exactly possible to ""sneak"" it to her either. but, i've found that if i mix it with super cold wet food (just enough to help against the taste of the glucosamine) she'll reluctantly eat it, as long as i keep her from her ""real"" food until she's done so.after using this product for roughly 3 weeks, i see no improvement and it's already time to order more. 'not cheap, by any stretch. but, we decided to stick with it for another bottle's worth just to see.as for the seller, they couldn't have been faster in their delivery. so, we're very pleased with them."
5,Great product,Our dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia six years ago. She has used Synflex since then and is doing great. I highly recommend this product.
4,Perfection in Hamlet's Perfection,"I must admit that this is the first Hamlet criticism I've ever read, but I was very impressed. The author is deep and thought-provoking and almost humerous at times while considering this work. The book is a bit dense at times, and tends to make references to other critics that only make sense if you have read them, but that does not damage the book beyond repair. The author bringgs up interesting ideas and interpretations, such as the virgin/whore split in men and Hamlet, that I had never considered before. This book is worth the time it takes to weed through it."
5,Hot song- totally underrated,"With a hot new look, and amazing new album on the way- critics were quick to dog this one- which is odd because it's such a great track!It's a far cry from Genie In a Bottle, a deep and dirty RnB/Hip Hop?Roxk flavored track that makes me wanna jump up and Shake My @ss- I know the song by heart- and the video - I can't even explain how I feel about the video (I gotta keep this at a G rating folks)The B side is one of the stand out tracks from the Album ""Stripped"" an all out Girl Grunge Rock Track-Christina's Back and she's bringing on the heat- Britney's Pop Fluff and Avril's Punk Poser don't stand a chance"
4,Adventures on the Post-Modern Frontier,"I've read all of Doctorow's work, but I keep coming back to Welcome to Hard Times. This slender volume is immense in its ambition, and focuses on elemental questions of courage and cowardice, the problem of evil, and its almost irresistable power. Set in the Dakota Territory in the late 19th century, the novel examines our highly sentimentalized American West through a post-modern lens. Doctorow lays open romanticized notions to expose the raw, ugly reality beneath. As always, Doctorow is almost poetic, and his characters simultaneously repulsive and attractive. If you've not read Doctorow, start here."
2,A big let-down after the first chapter.,"I bought this book because our County library system had no copies...now I see why. There are many more entertaining and better written books in this anti-romantic western genre (if it is a genre). I am not a big reader of westerns but BLOOD MERIDIAN by Cormac McCarthy is high on my list of all-time favorites. I got this book because the author had just came out with a new historical novel (MARCH about Sherman in the Civil War) that has received good reviews. I have read some other books by this author and never knew he'd written a western.The first chapter grabs you with good writing and fast action of the sex&violence; variety. Then the rest of the book drags on and on about the suffering of a fairly whiney, uninteresting lot of folks who try to make a go of the little town of ""Hard Times"". I had to force myself to finish it."
1,This Disappointing Compilation Underdelivers,"I really was looking forward to this book. On the positive side, the author did do a lot of research into the pre-1950 glamour pin-ups of which most of us today are not familiar. On the negative side, the artwork is entirely disappointing - small black & white images do not capture glamour very well. In addition, he puts too many models in the book with insufficient detail to each. Rather than doing a sad overview of the top 1,000 - he should have done a nice portrayal of the top 500. As it was, he was getting pretty desperate to get to 1,000. Elvira (the horror film commedienne), Nichelle Nichols (Star Trek's Lt. Uhuru)and Lily Munster are all fine actresses/characters - but glamourous - not at all. Finally, amazingly, he left out some modern superstars like Emme. Save your money and avoid this one."
2,I Didn't Like This At All,"I didn't like this movie at all. Mason was very obviously a strange and tormented man. He made me nervous with his total inability to fit in. At the same time I felt sorry for him. Joel David Moore did a very believable job of portraying a man who seemed to be on the brink of a breakdown. After Amber entered his life he seemed to improve, though I had trouble understanding why she sought him out and wanted to be with him. I also found it very unbelievable that his boss wanted to look after him. His boss was a very shallow person (in my opinion) who was not the type of person who would care for a very weird man. I kept hoping the movie would explain a common background for the two men that would explain this.I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because of the acting. It was very good."
3,a little too predictable...,"Although i did enjoy the story of the book, i did feel the end to be way too fairytale-ish. but if you are looking for a light, no-strings-attached read, this is a good one. I do love the writing style of Annie Garrett though, and i think that if she would just step out of Fairytale Theatre, she would be superb."
1,Make the Medication Fit the Illness,"Most truly adverse ""side-effects"" are the result of a misdiagnosis. People with tendencies towards manic-depression should not take SSRIs without an accompanying mood stablizer like lithium because, alone, SSRIs can worsen mania which in turn worsens depression. Responsible doctors don't let manic-depressive patients stay on Prozac alone. Sometimes they will simply change the prescription. Not everyone who takes prozac is violent. Not everyone who takes prozac is euphoric. Some people who take it simply become less ill with crippling disorders like depression and OCD. Most side effects pale in comparison with these disorders. And most people can tell whether they are hallucinating and know something is wrong if they are. Not everyone should take SSRIs, but on the other hand not everyone should take vitamin and mineral supplements. No book, certainly not this one, is a substitute for a careful evaluation of the facts of an individual case."
1,It will break!!!,There is a piece of plastic that holds the 2 ends of the armband together...this is made out of cheap plastic and will break!!! Buy an armband made entirely of the elastic material. The plastic is a weak link!!
1,Terrible product!,"This armband is poorly designed period. First, of all it is too big, i am a fit guy (but not skinny) and it doesn't fit my arm, it routinely slips down to my elbow during a workout. Second, it is oriented upside down, so that you have to turn your head downward to see your selections. If you want to wear the band inverted instead, you might risk the sansa falling out of the armband's socket.Through and through this is a cheap and useless product. I simply started wearing workout clothes with pockets so i can place my player inside."
4,Very acceptable,"Like others have said, the buttons and volume control are not easy to use, it does take a little work. Overall though I think this is a really good product. The player fits securely, and while running I've never had a problem with it sliding down my arm. I don't ever really look at the screen while I'm running, and I can't imagine why anybody would want to. I did however make sure I had a screen cover on my player to keep the plastic one on the armband from scratching. Another really nice thing about this is that it is washable, several of these that we looked weren't."
1,Cheaply made product,"This product is very cheaply made. The design is good and the size fits the sansa e200 adequately. However, mine broke during it's first use. It broke on the plastic ring where the velcro loops through. Now it is unusable. I will never buy a product from this company again."
5,Originally by Gucci. Noble Continues On.,"If you were a fan of Gucci's ""Noble"", then you're in for a treat. For quite some time, this much-loved cologne was unavailable until Alexander De Casta purchased the formula, and began producing it again. This is the exact formula, and garners comments everytime I wear it (and I wore it for years). It's nice to have this fragrance back."
3,it is light; I don't know how effective it is,"So this stuff feels good when I put it on. It flows well, isn't too heavy.But when I got dry eyelids, like really dry, it didn't help at all. so now I wonder how much it was doing before.I found this product: ""Canus Goats Milk All Natural Firming Eye Cream"" helped me eyelids a lot."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I was eager to see this rare film, but the quality of the DVD is so poor that it is unwatchable. Both the sound and the picture are terrible."
5,The Most accessible albums from Space,"I have about 30 Sun Ra recordings but this, by far, is his most accessible to the general public. This CD collects 2 concurrent recordings from 1958, and it's not ""far out""-- this could be Duke's big band (and as the liner notes that accompany the CD draw a parallel between Ra and Duke, this music is written specifically for the individual players in each band). You hear hints of Ra's Egypt/ Space mantra, but the music is in the forefront-- fantastic arrangements that really showcase Mr. Blount's writing and harmony abilities more than some of his other works, which tend to be viewed collectively rather than from his individual contributions. Plus, you really hear Ra play piano-- and HE COULD PLAY!! You see that he absorbed all the swing and bop language, before he really went out into the Stellarsphere....If you've never heard Ra, this is a great place to start. A highlight from his fabled career! Get it before this version goes out of print as well."
5,Another Long-Forgotten Gem,"Sun Ra stood as an iconoclast within the jazz world from his first recording in 1953. Indeed, Sun Ra stood as an enigma within our world.Inspired by what he claimed were experiences in outer space, Sun Ra's precept of jazz delved into a much more progressive and avant-garde structure, one that evolved from the be-bop stylings showcased on his first recordings.Jazz In Silhouette, one of many long forgotten Sun Ra albums, highlights the be-bop he cherished before stepping into the fold of the avant-garde. This album is rich in composition, with extended solos throughout courtesy of Sun Ra's Arkestra. To describe the music contained within this album as majestic would be an understatement. The sheer joy of the recording is finely captured here, every note and solo encompassing Sun Ra's larger themes of space, peace, and love.This is Sun Ra before the avant-garde. This is Sun Ra's take on be-bop. This is Sun Ra jazz."
4,Good for the money.,"This is about what you would expect for the price. I just got some new EastWest sounds including ""Stormdrum 2"" and wanted to be able to hit something to make the sound instead of the ol' fingers on the keyboard thing...It's fairly well-built and seems like it will stand up to the abuse of wayward drumstick hits... Set-up is really straight forward, and thanks to the free ""EZdrummer lite"", I was able to test it out on the home computer before going down to the studio to set it up. I only took off a star because I would have liked a little more separation between pads, by either a wider gap or a raised edge, also I would rather have the controls at the bottom and pads at the top...anyway, not a deal breaker by any means and for what I need, it fits the bill."
3,"Good idea, poor execution","This product was a good idea, but the execution of its construction is poor. It is responsive, does what it says, works relatively well as a controller. Problem one was the power, I actually had to send it back to alesis because there was a problem with the jack on the unit. Not a big deal. But the pads, while responsive, are a pain to adjust. The two bottom right pads on mine trigger at the same time (when you hit one, the other triggers too), and I've spent more time trying to adjust this (following the directions) than actually playing the darn thing. Even when I got it, I spent hours adjusting the other pads so they didn't trigger all at once, but those last two I can't fix. I can't even trigger them separately in order to adjust them! After having this for about two years with light use (and, to reiterate, more time adjusting it than actually playing it), I've basically given up on those two pads ever working right."
2,"Beyond Jaynes opening ""leg"" shot....","There's not much this film can offer, unless its some cool-looking British sedans and OK to decent character actors. Quyale is utterly wasted. Jayne is, well, Jayne, and the plot is pretty weak. As far as the picture & sound quality, let's not even go there...."
5,One of the best albums of Bobby Lyle !!!,"I listened to several albums but except ""The Genie"" which is quite funky and groovy, all others were more or less in the same jazzy style - but this album redefines his strength with LatinJazz ! For all others who don't know Bobby Lyle and like quality modern (Latin) Jazz - this should be the first entry album to buy..."
5,Cheap and effective,No complaints. Delivers 1080i and/or 1080p hi-def programing to tv sets from hi-def satelite receivers and dvd players.
2,bad cable,"got this cable from sfplanet but i don't see the lable inspiretech anywhere and no documentation proving this is infact a 1.3b certified cable. i get ok picture on 720p but on blue-ray playback (1080p) its really horrible. i get sparkles. im returning mine and going for the expensive ones, i think its worth the headache."
4,Grabbed by Grim Grotto,"Anyone who has read the first ten books (and I do highly recommend reading them in order) will be both pleased and slightly thrown by this new addition to the fantastically unfortunate series. In this, book the eleventh from Lemony Snicket the disaster-prone Baudelaire orphans make yet another great performance, but are dragged down by the sad change in our beloved villains. Count Olaf is not the menacing character he once was, but has become quite a ridiculous person. I'm mixed about some of the new characters, but am overall happy with this book. I see quite a positive change in Sunny, as she advances from a baby and becomes more like a real person. I did very much enjoy the unique comedy in Snicket's style, and the new mysterious clues of VFD. Despite the minor disappointments of the book it was quite a winning story, and I couldn't put it down."
4,One step closer ot the end.,"Lemony Snicket, The Grim Grotto (Scholastic, 2004)The Baudelaire orphans continue their adventures in this eleventh book of the celebrated series. A Series of Unfortunate Events has gone through ups and downs over the years, and it's recently been in something of a down phase; this looks as if it's the beginning of an upward swing, and thus I'm cautiously optimistic about book twelve (due out, as I write this, a few months from now).If you've liked the series so far, you're not going to find much different here, and it should do right by you. If you've not liked them, or not experienced them, you should probably either go back and start at the beginning (with the aptly-named The Bad Beginning) or, as Snicket cautions many times, just put the whole thing down and walk away."
5,Found By Accident,"I had never heard of Lemony Snicket until recently. I did a search for my favorite book called The Lost Treasure of Grandpa Jingle-Wingle and found out that people who bought that book also bought books by Lemony Snicket. I figued that anyone who likes The Lost Treasure of Grandpa Jingle-Wingle must have a similar taste in books as me. So I took the risk and bought The Grim Grotto, and now I am hooked."
1,STUPIDEST BOOK EVER,It is a really dumb book. About some stupid kids that lost there parents. THEY DESERVED IT!!!!!!!. I DON'T CARE IF THEY DIED TOO. I BOOK IS MORE WORSE THAN EATING CRAPE!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Oregon Scientific Giovannoni,"Purchased the OS Giovannoni in July and as mentioned in the previous customer reviews I too had the same problem with the detachable ""orb"" not working. I called OS directly and was told that the battery was not holding it's charge. He told me that they will be sending a replacement battery, but I am still waiting. I decided not to send back this clock until I got the replacement battery, but it's probably too late now."
3,Not for undergrads,"I bought this with great hopes and was a little disappointed. I do not find fault with the video as much as with my intent. I was hoping to show it to my class and use it to explain the masculine myth. The introduction was more work than anything the film could have contributed. It was just a little above the mark. Again, not finding fault with the film itself, but rather my motivation in buying it"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is ONLY helpful if you have never used FrontPage before. It offers very poor examples of advanced techniques such as DB queries and FrontPage server configuration. You would do just as well with a ""dummies"" book. This book is hardly a bunch of cliff notes, let alone a bible. As you could probably guess...I was extremely dissapointed. Buy a different book."
2,Nice but toaster doesn't work well,The oven works just fine but the up top toaster does not work well. Small food like frozen waffles slide down to the oven. Irritating.
1,SOFTCOVER EDITION COVER PHOTO,THE PUBLISHER COULD ADD SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE BOOK BY HAVING A PICTURE OF THE ARIZONA ON THE COVER.THE ARIZONA HAD TRIPLE GUN 16 INCH MAIN GUN TURRETS.THAT IS NOT A PICTURE OF THE ARIZONA ON THE COVER.IT IS LITTLE DETAILS LIKE THAT YOU WOULD THINK THE EDITOR MIGHT NOTICE.
1,"FAKE KNOCK OFF PERFUME, DO NOT BUY","This seller delivered a fake perfume to me, some people may not realize that perfumes are fake but I could tell the minute I opened the packaging. The perfume bottle and the perfume were definitely fraudulant which is very upsetting since this was supposed to be a christmas present. sellers who promote false advertising and believe they will be getting a ""one up"" on their customers deserve not to profit from deceptive business practices. Please do not buy into this scam."
3,A little strong..,I like all the Burberry perfumes but this one. I just couldn't wear it..to strong for me. It's still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I'll keep it there. I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle. Beware of those magazine samples...that's happened to me before.
4,Holiday Gift,Great to get the Burberry Brit Eau de Toilette. I will be a great stocking stuffer. It will be a winner.
3,Reminds me of Electric Youth,"On my skin, this reminds me of '80's pop sensation Debbie Gibson's Electric Youth. It's not bad, but it smells a little cheap and somebody didn't put a lot of effort into making this perfume. I think that I will stick to my Chanel Cuir de Russie and Frapin 1920."
3,Love the scent,"I really like this perfume's scent, however it doesn""t last very long. Went with the parfum as opposed to the eu de toilette thinking it would be better."
4,burberry brit eau de toilette for women,"Great product, looked like the genuine article, pretty sure it was. It had a little arab writing on the sticker but I still think it was legit. smelled good, madea great gift for someone. Only thing is that the guy has the wrong picture which led to some confusion when i first opened the box but good purchase overall."
5,Buckets of Imagination !,"I don't usually seek out science fiction, but I've learned that Mack Maloney brings more to the genre than anyone since Douglas Adams. The first two ""Starhawk"" books have established all the legs needed for an inspired series...I look forward to many more.Maloney's imagination is stuck on wide open...his story telling concise and so filled with ironic wit that I happily suspend disbelief and hang on for the ride. This newest book, ""Planet America"" puts me in mind of ""the Hitchhikers Guide"" with perfectly rational discussions and wry conversations going on in the most irrational circumstances and locations. Sort of like M*A*S*H (the movie), which brings up an idea!Nah...special effects couldn't do this kind of stuff, could they ?"
3,Batman's Cinematic Debut,"Directed with atmospheric flair by Lambert Hillyer, ""Batman"" (1943) remains among Columbia's better chapterplays. Though lacking the solid production values and crisp pacing of the Republic serials, the studio was more faithful in adapting comic-book heroics to the big screen. Hillyer keeps the low-budget hokum moving at a good clip - regardless of flubbed lines or continuity errors. (When Batman loses his cape during a fight scene, just keep shooting and ask questions later.) Uncensored and relatively uncut, the Caped Crusader's film debut is worth seeing."
4,Batman the 1st!,"This was the live premier of the caped crusader and partner on film. Lewis Wilson was the first to don the cowl for this exciting serial. Douglas Croft equates himself well as the junior partner Robin. The serial 15 chapters of sheer fun.The director was Lambert Hillyer a well known b movie director. This was his only serial. WWII was still happenning and the slang and jibes at the enemy of the times is prevalent. This is to be expected as that was what was said back then. the story is simple and fun. Dr Daka played with relish by J Carrol Naish is the bad guy leading a team of thugs to help him thwart the war effort.I will not bore you with a plot synopsis. but this film is a blast exciting fights. zombie hench men, and a pit of crocidiles just some of the thrills.Alfred is the butler as we know but he showed up here first before the comic books would use him. At this price for the many hours of enjoyment you will get I can only say buy it now!"
2,World War II Batman,"Oh yes, this looks like it was made in 1943, and all I can say is, if you are a Japnaeese American or a German American, you will not like this at all."
4,Another great book from the Honor Harrington universe,The background of this book is an extension of Weber's Honor Harrington universe. We meet familiar figures like Havenite superspy Victor Cachat. The interstellar intrigues are nicely told; my only objection is that they may be too convoluted.
1,"Horrible, boring drivel","I have read almost the entire Honor Harrington series. I'm reading them in order and figured I would read this series as more honorverse back story. WOW IS THIS BOOK BAD.All of the characters are the greatest in the world (well the book say they are over and over and over). Evertyhing they do is a matter of fact with very little real immagination. You don't have to figure anything out. The characters are bland and just not well developed.Heck the editors must have been bored reading this book as it's littered with items where the word used is the wrong word, just off by a letter or two.I'm only reading this book for backstory and forcing my way through it. The other books in the serises I would read in a day or two. After 3 weeks on this one I'm not even 1/2 way through .... it's THAT BAD.If it's Eric Flint's influnce please don't ever write another book with him.IMO, save your money, buy The Shadow of Saganami and get the 1 paragraph recap of the entire book."
4,"A good, not great, Honorverse book","Weber has spent a lot of time and though (and books!) developing the Honorverse book. Whilst Honor is not in the book (much), the book IS about the Honorverse. As such, it does a good job of filling out the Honorverse. Besides that, I enjoyed it !"
4,A new author for a beloved universe,"I was fairly nervous that David Weber decided to share his Honor Harrington universe with another author for a full length novel. I mean, over the course of the Honor Harrington series I've come to really enjoy his work and I didn't want it ruined by an inferior work by a different author. However, this book is no inferior product. True, the tone of the work is different then David Weber's solo works but not too different. Both his vision and Eric Flint's vision seem to be similiar enough to reside in the same universe.That said, this book shares several elements from the previous Harrington books. Its full of action and believable characters. It is quite easy to suspend your disbelief and really get into the novel. However, it is HIGHLY recommended that you read all the previous Honor books before this one.A quick read but worth it."
2,Please Make it Stop,This book began with endless pages of useless dialogue and just got worse. Mr. Weber needs to re-read some of his earlier books that broke up his endless useless details with a little action. This one just goes on and on and on. I felt like confessing to having kidnaped the Lindberg baby about half way through it. What torture. Want my money back. I would say it was a disapointment except I was also disapointed by War of Honor that carried on in the same manner for 800 pages and so I should have know better. Won't get fooled again.
3,Not like the picture,"We purchased this thinking we would receive the one in the picture. However, we received a different style. It is still the same team logo but in an almost completely different way! Other than that we like it."
3,good buy,I purchased this for my husband. He has used it several times and it works just as it is suppose to; although it does have a bit of a short handle on it. Other than that I would recommend this.
1,Pure wackness,Was number one on my Worst singles of 2003 list ajnd with good reason it blew.If you like this I am sorry for you.
5,works for me,"Great worm, gets me alot of bites. I use it on a football shaky heads and bass seem to like it. I also like the black grape for winter months and cold water situations. Cant go wrong with this worm"
4,Texas Motorcyclist Gets His Kicks on Arizona Route 66,"Kirk Woodward's video of his tour of the Arizona portion of Route 66, as well as side trips to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, is interesting and informative for those of us who love The Mother Road. He presents the history of Route 66 and many of the attractions and wonderful scenery found in northern Arizona. This is great viewing for people who want to see some of what Arizona has to offer as well as for the fans of Route 66."
5,The only way to see America,"Although I haven't seen this video, I have done something better... I have traveled the longest stretch between Seligman, Az. and Kingman, through Oatman, and into Golden Shores. I go on the Rt. 66 Fun Run every year, and it just gets better every time. I am going to purchase the video, and I would encourage anyone interested in ""The Mother Road"" to do so also, but go out and drive it as well, you won't be sorry. If you want to see hundreds of old cars from the early 1900's, to the 70's muscle cars, as well as brand new vehicles, this is the place to be. It is usually the 1st weekend in May every year, and it starts in Seligman, on a Saturday, and ends in Golden Shores on Sunday, the 2nd day. Be there, or be square."
3,Far East Redux,"I was hoping it would be a bit more like Morse and Brown's previous movie "" A Town Like Alice "" which was on par with "" For Whom The Bell Tolls ""... But it fell way short. But Helen Morse and Bryan Brown made it worth watching anyway."
2,Book ok but overpriced.,"I was disappointed to find that this book was priced, as a used item, at $5 over the new price on the back of the book. I wrote seller feedback to voice this, but was emailed by the seller and asked to withdraw my feedback, as it would look bad for them. I found the book for much less on another site with shipping (about 1/2), which I explained to the seller in my return email. As the seller complained to Amazon, my feedback was removed because it was 'related to the product, not the seller'. I disagree. The book was ok, but it was being sold for far more than it was worth. It was a seller issue. This really made me angry, and I am finished with Amazon after MANY successful orders before. I have always rated things well...I do not appreciate having my honest feedback deleted with no opportunity to defend it."
5,Great information,"This book was a gift to a friend. He said he loved it because the information was very practical and down to earth. It also helped him to remember some of the things he had forgotten about how to be a better money wise person. He has passed it on to his son to arm him with great information too,"
3,Unrealstic in Real Estate,"My biggest problem with the book is the subject of real estate. He writes as if today I buy a 500K home and two years later it will sell for 900K. Sure that happened in the late 90's up until 2006, but not any more. Also, he says that renting is a waste of money. Well, I pay $1375 for a 2 bedroom apartment. If I bought a house in the same neighborhood, I would pay about $3500 per month. Sure, if your rent is close to a mortgage payment, it makes sense to buy. But he obviously thinks that everyone is paying rents close to a monthly mortgage, which is not true."
3,How to get rich is to write a book about it,"Bach does indeed give a common-sense approach to money management - but that's the problem. Spend less and save more, he says, and most of us heard this from the cradle. If you know nothing about budgeting, investing, credit control, and responsible spending, this book is for you, but there's really nothing in it that most of us haven't heard before. Might be useful for young people just getting started, but not really for people late in life. We've already heard it and if folks who don't get it by now probably won't just from reading this. I DO highly recommend Suze Orman's ""The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke."" It's aimed at 30- and 40-somethings but has practical advice for anyone"
5,Even my teen . . .,"Even my 17 year old son likes this one. I have one for my own use and he picked it up and after reading for awhile said to me ""If I had a bible like this one I'd even read it"". So I'm here looking for a new one just like it."
4,GOOD SHOW,It's the sextet/septet ushering in 1986 without any verbal fanfare. The trombonist Tim Williams does not solo on the first track. I Want To Talk About You is a 10 min. feature for the alto sax of Donald Harrison complete with out of tempo intro and a coda. There is a brief solo from the pianist Mulgrew Miller. Terance Blanchard and Jean Toussiant round out the group.
5,The Poet of Tolstoy Park,One of the best books I've read in a long time. Gives one pause to consider what is important in life and what isn't. A book about courage and taking the road less traveled.
3,Enter the game....,"In a world of Virtual Reality, a wheelchair bound police officer can walk, and a depressed woman can be happy, but a hacker can be trouble. When Walter got the Killobyte system, he thought it was just another game until he got into it. Ball found it a way of seeking happiness that her ex-boyfriend had taken from her. When the meet the understand and like each other. But they also become trapped in the game by Phreak, a teenage hacker. Trapped in a game that could literally mean life or death, Walter and Baal search for a way to beat Phreak and his virus"
5,Wow! A NEW Mark Twain work? Awesome,"Lee Nelson seems to channel Mark Twain in this riveting story of further adventures of Huck and Tom. Had I not known that a second author (in modern times) penned the majority of the book, I would not have noticed; it feels like Twain all the way. I had to specifically follow the reference to identify where Twain ended and Nelson began. This book is full of adventure, discovery, romance, friendships and loyalty, and it deepened my enthusiasm and respect for Mark Twain. It also introduced me to another great author, Lee Nelson.I challenge you to read this book without looking for the division, and I dare you to find a break between Twain and Nelson. This book could be included in an official Twain study. Huck Finn lives!"
5,THIS IS A MUST-SEE,"SAVING FACE is a must-see movie! it is multi-layered, beautifully written and directed, and comically poignant. indie movies do NOT get better or truer to life than this one. joan chen is at her best, and she brings the character of Ma to life. i watched it three times, and i loved it more every time. michelle krusiec does a wonderful job portraying Wil, the sometimes awkward, always uncertain and moving between 2 worlds surgeon. lynn chen is hot! cultural ideas, practices, mannerisms, taboos, everything was depicted accurately (which is not easy to do unless one wants to sell out). i tell ya...it's a must see!"
2,Charming tale that can be watched again & again. Lovely...,"The story of all these actors lives coming together in uncertainty & balance...a beautiful love story that reaches the heart with kindness. Exciting cast, excellent perfomances, a passionate film I shall reflect upon often...Thank-you for giving us this gift.Best of luck at the up-coming awards & congratulations.Best wishes & keep those movies coming!Mary Bell"
3,Saving Face,"This was an interesting movie because it addressed a variety of issues; cultural change, generational differences, sexual preferences and sexual behavior. After all the conflict, I liked that it was hopeful - good for teaching older adolescents about mixed messages and expectations."
1,Saving Face-- in the dark,"The movie was great, that's why I wanted my own copy without commercials, etc.The copy was horrible. It was like the whole movie was in the dark, at night."
4,Nobody Is Safe,I remember watching the preview of Saving Face a week before I got it and for some reason I was expecting it to be more comedy than love story. It slipped my mind what this film was really about but after the first fifteen minutes you see how the two girls look at each other and it becomes loud and clear. If you ask me Saving Face isn't really a love story but more like a story showing that even if it's a girl dating a girl relationships are all the same. That's clear when Vivian (Lynn Chin) gets mad at Wil because her hectic life of being a surgeon leaves her no time to spend with her new love. The love wasn't strong enough to pull you in but the comedy definitely is. You also have the mystery of who is the man that Wil's (Michelle Krusiec) Mom is secretly seeing and got her pregnant. Although Saving Face can get a little long at times it's still worth a watch. You may get a different vibe from it than I did but it's a good film no matter what.
4,It's fine,"Dogs don't like anyone touching their teeth so it's been difficult deciphering if it's useful. But, guess it can't hurt."
2,Terrible,"I looked at the reviews for this movie, thought it'd be worth a shot. Terrible--I just didn't find much of anything funny. Maybe some of the themes in this movie are played out and has become dull. Only a small number of parts were funny. The chicks were hot though. Nicholas D'Agosto did a good job, I could care less about his partner. What's his name in the movie again?"
2,Utterly pathetic,"You need only four words to properly review this movie: the writer was stoned.Actually, no, that's not correct, a stoned writer would have been far more imaginative. This is the most transparent, horribly-written movie I've ever seen. It's so bad that it's close to being a parody without actually getting there.Only thing that saves it is the 2 lead actors; they did a good job (within the restraint of the material). But I have never before seen a more pathetic excuse for a script. Any teenager who's seen the American Pie series could have turned out this crappy copy. Watching it, the movie just screams ""you liked the other teen movies (the ones that were actually original), any room for me?""The football players become cheerleaders. The loser boyfriend gets dumped. They try the Fountain of Troy and fail. And there's a lot of relationship stuff that other movies have already done 100 times.There, I just saved you 2 hours of your life. I only wish I could get my own back."
4,Fired Up is not for wussies.,"I've been out of high school for a while, but I'm happy to see that nothing changes. We all need the jocks, the geeks, the everyday students to show us just exactly what to expect from life. And you better be able to laugh at yourself and others, too! Under all the bravado from the kids in this movie, it is easy to see the softness underneath the brass, and the inevitable fondness the develops all around."
4,Good solid disc,Pharoah Sanders has made a big impression on me with his music&this set is no different.i have always dug the vibe&feel he has with his horn.i have many of his recordings.he doesn't get the love he deserves the man has made alot of great music.check this out.
1,not 8g as described,"This unlabeled thumb drive appears to hold about 4g, not 8g as described. The packaging had a label sticker that said ""32 mb""This seller is either not making an effort to vet their products or is dishonest"
2,Need old computer,I got this second hand and my computer cannot even open it--says it's incompatible. I have Windows 7. Just warning others.
4,Get Gnar,"Beautiful lens. High quality but vignetteing can be a bit of a bummer. I use mine to shoot BMX, but it's uses aren't limited to extreme sports. I've had great results on music video type projects too."
3,It Doesn't Live Up To Its Title,"Frank, Joe and Chet are called upon by Chet's uncle, an instructor at Millwood Art School, to find two valuable oil paintings stolen from the collection of the school's sponsor, Jefferson Davenport. The paintings, of nearby Fort Senandaga, were painted by an ancestor of Davenport's and one of the paintings in the series is supposed to contain a clue to the hiding place of a valuable chain of gold. The book was average, it had an okay plot and a moderate amount of action. I expected better from the interesting sounding title, but it wasn't bad. I recommend reading it, but I don't think that too many fans will get very excited over it."
4,Great CD,"This cd is tight but it has its flaws the best tracks are str8in it out, world fulla killaz, Get Loose, and other hitz that were tight,this cd is solid!"
1,Not what I expected...,After buying Blac Haze's first album and loving every track I expected big things when I saw his second album finally had arrived...sadly it is nowhere near as good as Res-Sa-Rec-Shun...
3,for the open-minded spiritual person,"This exploration of the world's most transcendent story of love is rewritten in its entirety within the first chapters. The reader lives the Egyptian tale of the twins Isis and Osiris through a dramatic romanticization of the renowned myth. The author shows how, via detailed exercises, this myth relates to the modern design of marriage and provides the reader with the search for oneself throughout."
3,Opinions are like...,"Ok I'm a Coldplay fan, and other than the rendition of Clocks, I found nothing of value in this CD (and i prefer to hear the piano version anyway). Like someone else said, a string quartet just isn't enough of a range to truly do Coldplay justice on an instrumental level... it deserves a full orchestra.And the only reason I give Clocks any points is because it will always be a favorite of mine on any instrument; the perfect mix of simple elegance lacing a profound desire... though like I said, nothing will beat the feeling you get when those first chords begin to sound from Chris Martin's piano... nothing.But thats just my opinion. I still bought it, and I occationally listen to it. Just don't get your hopes up just because you see the words ""String Quartet"" on the cover of your favorite band. This ain't no symphony, folks."
3,Just OK,"I was disappointed that there were so many previews of other VHS movies related to this production. But it is usable and does have what I wanted. I will just have to ""que"" it up and not play from the beginning of the tape."
3,Salsa if you please !,"I was wishing Carlos would have played more of his ""Hits"". Didn't care for the two lead rap singers, couldn't tell if Carlos was doing a Rap concert for the younger crowd or sprinkling in some of his older hits for us "" Older Guys"" to keep us content ? If you like Salsa then I think you will like and rate this DVD higher as it is very nicely flavored."
1,The Pits. The end.,"Not sure which movie the positive reviews saw. Surely it wasn't this one. I have to wonder how many are confused with the original '61 version. The acting is above average with a minor star-studded cast- no complaints there. That's the end of the positives. It's a laughable that they have the nerve to call it Poe. It has promising moments of dark violence, torture and insanity, all to be completely overshadowed and undone by the ridiculous ending. It wouldn't have been more pathetic if they had a screen that read ""And they all lived happily ever after..."" It's even complete with fairy tale like soundtracking. Anyone who knows anything about Poe stories knows they don't come with happy endings. It's part of their horror.On the whole, it's Disney's Sleeping Beauty meets snuff film."
4,Very nice socks but quality has gone down somewhat,I bought 18 new pairs of these socks a little more than two months ago. I have really liked these socks for years now and was replacing my latest ones from a couple years ago when they were made by ultimax instead of wigwam. I like the snug and very thin fit of these socks and they have been my favorite running socks for some time now. The only problem is that I think the quality of this newest batch I bought may have gone down because I have had three socks that have gotten catastrophic holes in the toes of the socks from this newest batch that is only a couple of months old. The socks perform just like I like them to but I hope I just had a few bad socks out of the bunch I bought.
1,Poor performance with bad tech support,"This product is a waste of money and time. The picture is grainy and blurry. This card will not capture the middle band channels. My card will not capture channnel 66 to 74. When I called the tech support, I was told that the card requires a PERFECT signal strength. I was informed that this product was a cheap product and that I should not expect much from it. They stated that they aware about the problem but there's nothing they could do. I guess ADS pays their tech support extremely well, $99.00 for a crappy video card is considered ""cheap"". If you are looking to buy a good video capture card, look elsewhere. I have been extremely happy with Hauppauge (I paid less than for it than this junk). Also you can get Windows Remote separately (don't need to buy bundle with this crappy card)."
1,Very Cheap,"Item looks great, easy set-up but its very cheaply made. The platform broke after 2 weeks and it needed to be replaced. I wish I had my money back because its a cheaply made product that will break over and over again. Buyer beware!"
5,"She's not only a bigband leader, also a great piano player","Besides her it's also nice to hear George Mratz on the base, for me one of the best younger base players"
5,Immigrant Students in American Schools,"A great book for you to better understand immigrant students' life or struggles in American public schools. It may make you have a different view about the importance of bilingual education. This is a great resource not only for the teachers or administrators who help the ESL/LEP students at school, also good for anyone who cares about America as a society."
1,"Oh, gimme a break......","Please. This supposed ""true story"" is nothing but an overly-ambitious fantasy of a fan fiction -- and it's not even original. I run a fan fiction webzine, and trust me when I say that every bit of this totally dreadful ""book"" (I use the term loosely) is not only incoherent, but a good bit of it seems an awful lot like it was lifted directly from many of the stories I've published on my website. Neither I nor any of those authors have ever said they were anything but fiction, though! It seems to me that Ms. Waters has a very active imagination and a huge problem separating fact from fantasy. Not worth the paper it's printed on unless you want some very expensive toilet roll...unfortunately, this drives home the potential problems with self-publishing without oversight by an editor!"
1,Fan Fiction,"This is fan fiction, other than what the title and ads attest to. This becomes embarrasingly evident within the first few pages. Written as a novel,it is a lightweight depiction of Beatle John Lennon as experienced through a child's eyes who grows to love him as a young teen. He later falls in love with her (despite the age difference and the true loves in his life, which he brings to meet her as well.) But the devoted teen cannot really come through for him when he needs her the most. Loosely based on Lennon's life through the years, until his murder in 1980, the author attests to this fictional account at the end of the forward, as a therapeutic means of grieving his death. The fictional basis should be clearly stated in the title."
1,Author's say-Janet Celia Waters,"Dear HMV Nipper,HMV Nipper is really the name of the RCA dog. You lied when you said I plagarized your internet magazine. WHAT magazine? You aint nothin but a hound dog. Just don't step on my blue suede shoes.Janet Celia Waters"
1,Order was cancelled by seller,I can't review this item beacause the item was cancelled by the seller. I did not order another!
5,Amer Herit Dict w/CD rom,"An excellent reference whether it be for home or office. The thumb index, a must for any dictionary, does not disappoint, nor does the handsome tables and graphs. A terrific bargain for the price. American Heritage produces another winner."
2,American Heritage Dictionary,"I like the dictionary because of its updated content, font size and many illistrations. I purchased this dictionary because of the CD-ROM that was included for the price. The CD-ROM was a total disapointment. I am unable to use it because of compatibility issues with Windows 7, which is my current operating system. The text version is heavy and cumbersom to handle but well worth the price I paid for the combination. I would have prefered a CD-ROM version of the dictionary that was compatible with Microsoft Windows' latest operating system."
2,"Great dictionary, poor software implementation","I've been using the digital version of The American Heritage Dictionary since 1995. It is one of the most useful references that I have. Hoping to get an updated dictionary and an improved interface I bought this new version. Whereas the dictionary contains updated content and many new words, the software implementation is amateurish. My old version was designed by Softkey, the new one (1999-2006) by Kanda Software. The new interface is poorly designed both aesthetically and functionally. Important features of the old version are missing. Gone is the Word Hunter, which looks for definitions that contain given words. I am so disappointed with this new version that I am still using the old one."
1,Worst Tool Set I've Ever Owned!,"This Wilmar socket set is inexpensive - it ought to be free! The sockets barely meet their size as stamped - some are missing their detent balls, so they just fall off the handle - the ratchet handle is stiff, crude, and takes a lot of effeort to turn. This is a terrible product."
2,Get it cheaper somewhere else,I bought this for my husband. He has yet to use it. He bought the same thing from Walmart for $10. I wish I had looked around. The tools work fine but you can find them cheaper.
1,Cheap is cheap,"Bought this to keep in my car. Used it twice and the ratchet stripped out and is rendered useless. The steel used to make these is well below par. Soft, cheap imported steel. It makes a good paperweight, if a ratchet set fits your decor... otherwise, not worth the low price."
5,Love it!,Very concise and lucid. Perfect for someone like me who does not know Sanskrit but was always curious to know what's in it. Money well spent!
3,Gandhi's Gita,"If you wish to understand the Bhagavad Gita itself, order one without Gandhi's commentary first. Reading the Gita with Gandhi's commentary interwoven can disrupt the flow and continuity of ideas. Nonetheless, by the end of the book you will appreciate some of the major reasons Gandhi loved the Gita, and its calling to truth, benevolence, and non-attachment to the fruits of one's actions. The Gita was of course Gandhi's favorite text, and those wishing to fully appreciate Gandhi's religious thought will find this helpful in giving dimension to Gandhi's Hindu beliefs"
3,*** OK Book ****,I bought this book because I wanted to read the Bhagvad Gita and this one was written by Gandhi.How ever I found that it is not a good translation and at many places uses words which are commonly understood only by hindus. So if you do not have a good background about hinduism then I would not recommend this. Instead the translation by one Stephen Mitchel is much better.
2,It's not worth it.,This books offers nothing. It should only cost $2.00. I don't know why Amazon is even selling it.
2,Too Basic for My Use,"The book is so general that it had little use to me, or probably anyone else with even a modicum of collections business experience. In fact, the only real value I found was a few decent supplier and vendor references, and a dated copy of the FDCPA."
5,works great and cheap,Its works great and its cheap. Started to use this brand when the other brands carbon SUCK! I use both carbon and this remover in all my tanks and fishes seems to be very happy.
2,Could use some work... a lot of work,"Basically it's a boring anime that doesn't have a very interesting storyline. There is hardly any voices and its also kinda hard to follow. I think the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because its creepy and i like creepy stuff. If you dislike maniquines then you will be plenty scared. You will understand if you watch it. If you really want to see it, rent it first. Thats what I did and im glad that's all i did."
5,Great stuff,"""How to Avoid Being Seen"" and ""How to defend yourself with a piece of fresh fruit"" are both classic sketches, and are not to be missed, like everything else in this movie. There are some semi-unsuccessful bits here, but that doesn't matter, along with the fact that it has no plot. Just get it."
1,The worst editions of these three films,"There is only one reason to buy this repackaging of these three films - 'And Now for Something Completely Different', which is not available in a better presentation. Both the versions of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' are the worst possible presentations of these films available on video. In fact, 'Baron Munchausen' is the fist time that I have seen a wide screen film presented on DVD that was culled from a pan and scan video edition, re-framed as letterbox and then mastered to anamorphic. In this era of digital re-mastering in high definition for presentation in anamorphic as the de-facto standard for DVD releases, this edition is a travesty.Don't buy it."
5,Keeps It Simple with your personal seam allowances,"#2 in her wonderful series. A must have for all quilting libraries and for those who have a tough time getting that ""perfect 1/4 inch"" seam allowance. How to design spectacular quilts with simple pieces. What a master at creating the unusual. This book focuses on your personal seam allowance and allows even the most inexperienced quilter to make marvelously pieced quilts."
4,Open Your Mind,"The muted group theory of language development explored in this book gives additional insight to any reader of Deborah Tannen or Robin Lakoff. Though out of print, it is worth searching out. It sparks new thoughts, answers some questions while raising others. For anyone interested in sociolinguistics and gender based language studies, this is a great starting place."
5,I just love this band.,"Reviews on music and art is so subjective I never read them. I just got to comment that this band is such a gem. They have this mean heavily riffed garage sound. I think they were just too early with their sound. I think if they were a few years later, with the Black Keys and White Stripes, they would of definitely had more success."
4,Sasha alive and well!!!,"I found this after xmas Dec 30th at Walmart (in store) clearance price $21.00. You might go to their website and see if they still have any. I my granddaughter loves doing her hair. I did not give her the makeup as it is not suitable for little girls under 13. The hair is durable and can withstand braiding, twisting and brushing without shedding. Good luck in your search."
3,"Not enough info in the ""powder""","There does not seem to be a contact address how to get the powder as a ready-to-go mix.No info on price of the powder, especially if you do not have an adequate health foods store in the neighborhood.For the rest it's a pretty good book!"
5,An underrated classic,"This clever satire is unforgettable--if you get into it and let it work its magic. Miss Brodie is not to be taken at face value; the members of her ""set"" start out admiring her and then gradually find out her dark side as they come of age, move away from her, and even turn against her and betray her--and we can understand why."
2,not what i thought,"This CD is not what it seems and is appropriate only for ""jazz heads"" that have the sophisticated approach that Ray Brown demands."
1,Save your money,"What a joke this was! It was like Yoga cheerleading style! Completely wrong music, stlye, hard to follow, it was obviously a RA RA Aerobics instructor/cheerleader who completely doesn't get yoga at all - making her tape just like all her other lame tapes. She should stick to her dance type tapes and leave the Yoga to the experts."
1,Pretend annoying yoga,I found this workout NOT yoga I have no idea what Denise was swinging her arms around for at all and jumping all over the place like she just had a hit of cocaine or something. Her voice was annoying and constant...she should have been trying out for a . waitress. I am tossing this stupid tape!
2,Not Yoga,"I enjoy Denise Austin's Morning Stretch program on Lifetime, which has a little yoga at the beginning and end. Apparently this product was released before she became enlightened. The title should have given me a clue -- ""Fat Blasting"" and ""Yoga"" don't go together."
2,What a horrible voice...,"I'm not crazy about this DVD for several reasons. She rushes through the movements (yes, it's supposed to be a ""workout"", but it's definitely hard to keep up the first few times). She is not nice to look at. But most importantly, I have never watched the whole DVD with the volume on - I just can't stand that raspy, over-enthused voice. Beginners should start elsewhere."
3,you need a yoga ball,"I never finished the video because you need a yoga ball.It was never mentioned in other reviews.The first part was as usual with Denise its more about exercise then yoga,however you always get a good work out with her program."
4,Good first set of darts,"Really good set of first darts. Not the best in the world, but very solid, and work quite well. If your just getting into the sport, or want to try Tungsten Darts, this is a good first step."
5,Messiah-Great Edition,"Exactly what I expected, at a reasonable price! This score is easy to hold and easy to use when singing."
5,fast service on order!,Our choir is using this book for our Christmas music. I placed several orders and all were filled quickly and efficiently.
5,Excellent,"As a choir student who just learned Messiah for the first time, I found this edition a wonderful work. It is not only a pleasure for Messiah purists (see review below) but also for those newly introduced to Handel's work. I loved using the Watkins Shaw Edition so much!"
3,So So..... Definately Has problems,"Panda Anti-virus is rather inexpensive and it seems to work alright at capturing virus threats. It loads rather quickly is unobtrusive and packed with features. However it has some major issues for an Anti-Virus product.The product does a real time scan for ""unknown"" threats this can cause major problems to your PC. It locked up my PC and I thought I was going to have to reload it. Fortunately I was able to get into the admin section of the software and turn off all the extra features such as IM scanning, and Unknown Threat detection also known as True prevent. If it captures a virus sometimes it is not able to clean the virus and in some cases crashes when it detects malware.If you want to find something inexpensive, then I would suggest AVG or Avast which are free."
2,Broken,Got two years out of this breaker bar. Broke fork that holds the 1/2 inch adapter. Had been coming apart before it broke.
4,Good products,"Good strings. I bought for a 3/4 guitar that i noodle around with. The strings have a nice feel to them but tey don't last as long as elixirs, of course. They did, indeed, stay in tune. Even on my cheap, beloved, pawn shop guitar."
5,Best Ever ??,After stumbling across the Wingman series I found myself hooked on all of Mack Maloneys series...especially Starhawk. I found that I couldnt put it down. I look forward to the spring/summer of 2003 for Starhawk #4. I recommend the Starhawk series to everyone.
5,Always Exciting,"Mack Maloney continues to bring the most exciting and innovative action to his readers. Fourth Empire is a fast paced, entertaining adventure - another in a long line of Maloney hits."
1,Dark Shadows,Actually this movie I bought for my brother who just loves vampire movies. I personally cannot stand horror movies especially vampire movies. What a waste of money to even make such movies.I can't tell you anything about this movie.
1,WARNING! The image on these DVDs is to be CROPPED!,"If you don't like your TV shows cut/edited, you should read further before you buy[...] the original square 4:3 image will be CROPPED (or matted) to a ""fake"" widescreen ratio! That means that those buying the DVD set will be seeing LESS image than on the original broadcasts, just like the botched-up first season set of ""Kung Fu.""MGM does not deserve our money if they're going to monkey around with a TV show's aspect ratio. This series was NOT shot ""widescreen safe"": some production personnel on the series have confirmed that the series was shot in 4:3 and was intended ONLY for 4:3 and are NOT happy with MGM's decision to use a cropped widescreen master for the DVD set.Five stars for the episodes themselves, only one star for this DVD set due to the cropped aspect ratio and lack of extras."
5,Excellant,The whole series and it was great fun watching it again!Funny how the 90's series was put toghether well!
1,Painfully boring,"So we waited, and waited, but about a half hour into this gave up. Boring. Always. Not one interesting scene or conversation. So painful ."
1,Went dead,"Searching for a good humidifier is a lot tougher than I thought. This unit looks good in the picture. It has a humidistat, it's digital, it's programmable etc... etc... There is just one small problem - it stopped working after about a month.My advice to anyone looking for a humidifier is to get the simplest one you can. One that has one or two speeds, is not too loud and has a decent method of filling the tank. The one ""extra"" that is worthwhile is a unit that shuts itself off if there is no water left. A simple humidifier will cost you a lot less than this thing and it'll work just fine."
2,Performs just well enough so you cannot return it.,"This is the second and last Bionaire Hunidifier I will own. This one barely meets (?) the specification for hunidifying the space. The product appears to perform but the amount of water evaporated seems paltry. Humidity cannot be maintained in the space in which I employ it, well under that specified for its use. I disassembled the unit to check the humidifier pad and found 2/3 of it ""bone dry"". I have only used the product for 1 month. The filter replace indicator marginally indicated the filter should be replaced."
2,interpersonal communications,"Was ok, but was the international edition, not the exact one that is used in my class. But it works!"
2,Fiction with exposition on Clicking,"This book is a remarkable work of fiction. The odd thing is that it doesn't matter. The book is an elaborate allegory that depicts the timeline of certain charismatic/pentecostal developments in the U.S., Canada and Great Britain during the latter portion of the 20th Century. It goes into some detail about Benny Hinn's influence of the modern music group U2. It attempts to debunk Dake-Bonoism and instead bolsters the cause. I give my reserved endorsement.The biggest advantage of this book is it's discussion of the contemporary variation on speaking in tongues called clicking. This involves cupping the mouth with your hands while praying in tongues quietly under your breath. The reason it is called clicking is that a slight clicking sound is made with the tongue and soft palate.This book explains it better than I."
1,Not Credible,"The author presents a fictional account of her exploits that simply are not credible. No citations, no footnotes, no endorsements from Christian pastors, theologians, physicians, witnesses, or other Christian writers. If these are missing, beware. This is a wild ride and certain to betray your trust in the power of God to overcome evil, to counsel and seek His own. The Lord Jesus Christ most certainly did not authorize the writer to attack the Catholic Church, and her accusations about Christian church child care centers is simply slanderous and without merit. This book is trash worthy."
4,good reading,"out of all the brothers i thought morgan was the best, big teddy bear and what a heart. the whole series is great."
1,THIS IS AWFUL!,"THIS IS AWFULI have never felt so cheated. I honestly thought this book would be a helpful tool in coping with an extremely difficult surgery. This book was written from a person with the mentality of an 11 year old and the writing capability of a 3rd grade student at best. There are more than 200 errors with regard to simple spelling and punctuation. The graphics and pictures are no better than what is supplied with a generic computer, and barely visible at that. He must have created this on his own at a Kinko's. The sentences are not even properly structured. This book is terrible and extremely expensive. It's not even worth $4 much less $64!!! What a rip off. This so-called 'author' is a cheat. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! No reputable supplier should ever promote or sell this horrible excuse for a book."
1,Riddled with errors - not worth $70,"I feel bad ripping into this book, as the author seems like a nice person but the amount of spelling errors and the level of writing is unacceptable. I cannot believe that one, he did not get someone to proof read his work and two that amazon is selling this product. I personally don't think this was worth the $70+ (cost including shipping) and feel I could write a better book myself. Maybe if I was American the insurance section would have been more helpful but I got better information from personal blogs. I would have maybe paid $20 for this book and think it should have been sold as an online resource."
4,Almost Excellent,"First, let me begin by saying this is a thoroughly enjoyable set, the songs overall are first rate. I've listened to it dozens of times in my store and never tire of it. The Amazon editorial review pretty much has it right on, but it didn't mention the solid cuts from Alphy Blondy (#10) and Kiassa (#12). I'm very much looking forward to hearing more of Kiassa - her voice is strong the hypnotic song makes a nice end to a groovy disc.BUT, I can't give it five stars because it totally neglects Spanish Speaking Latin America. Nothing from Los Cafres? Gondwana? Los Pericos?? Los Fabulosos Cadillacs? HUH? Not just an overisght, but nearly criminal..."
3,A nice try,"This book is an admirable attempt to guide neo-pagan parents to suitable names. However, while it is interesting and fairly well organized by topic, the reader needs to double-check the author's attributed meanings. ""Surya"" (for example), is indeed a Hindu deity, but is the sun GOD and not the sun GODDESS.I'm also a little irritated by the author's apparent theory that if a name is Hindu, it's pagan. It takes more to make a pagan name than merely being non-northern European or non-Judeo-Christian.But a good place to start a search."
3,Overated but good,"Certainly there is some very good music on this album, but I've always thought this album was overated. The shorter pieces suffer from a lack of cohesiveness and ramble on a bit in a laid back, offhand way. They don't really go anywhere. The long centerpiece composition ""Atlantis"" is for the most part an organ workout for Ra and is by turns extremely aggressive, spacey and ultimately exhausting. There are some great passages but its just too long. I would recommend ""The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra Vol. 1"", or the truly magical ""Magic City"" or ""Other Planes of There"" before Atlantis. Those albums all contain long compositions that are more rewarding. Heliocentric Worlds is comprised of smaller pieces that flow into one another creating in effect one long suite. I'm not saying Atlantis isn't worth having because it is, just that there are better Sun Ra albums out there that you might want to pick up first."
3,okay,This was great as far as keeping the dog's bed in place. We had a Boston Terrier who loved to tear and move his beds. I would have liked a tear proof material. I also appreciated being able to throw it in the washing machine.
5,Great Pet Lounger,This product is very durable and fits right beside our own folding chairs in our camper storage compartment. Since it sits a couple inches above the ground it is easy for the dog to step into and you don't have to worry about the ground being damp.
5,Pharoah live - how can you go wrong?,The energy on this album is amazing. The musicianship is stunning and beautiful. Even the bonus tracks are right up there... Highly recommended... This band is on fire thru out the entire set.

5,great story,I got this book because I could not figure the relationship between little dorrit and the family from the video. I was surprised to find the story was written in 70 installments which made it very readable. It was also entertaining to discover what the video left out. very entertaining book.
3,Overly dark illustrations,"I too will discuss the publication; the text is wonderful! Although I like the binding and the large format of the Nonesuch edition, I am totally unhappy with the illustrations. Many are so dark that you cannot make out what they are. I have another edition (Everyman) that has beautiful renderings of the illustrations. I am surprised that no one else has commented on this; I plan to visit Barnes and Nobles and view if this defect is only in this particular title or the whole series. Great book; lousy illustrations."
5,as stated Little Dorrit,"The book was as described and arrived within a reasonable amount of time. The condition was ""good"" and who doesn't like Dickens. It takes too long to read this book in the allotted library time sequence. This way you have your OWN copy."
5,A great read,"Dickens is revered for a reason and this story is a good example of his knack for telling a story and sketching characters. A rags to riches to rags story with a tidy moral bow to wrap it all up, with mystery and surprise to keep the pace. Dickens has an unrivalled ability to succinctly portray a character and human nature, which shines here. His description of a stock bubble mania aptly describes our own times.This kindle version is excellent, with few errors. Included are original illustrations that expand nicely on the kindle fire. Worth every penny."
2,Medieval Boredom,Medieval Conquest is a game that was designed for the bargain bin. Everything about it is shallow or mediocre or worse. There's a reason why its price started at $20 and is now already down to $10. Avoid this game and play Majesty instead.
5,Masterful Storyteller,"This novel tackles a subject of serious and timely concern, the menace of predacious pedophiles. Keene has done a masterful job of storytelling by using fiction as a vehicle to express the collective rage we all feel about social injustice, while at the same time using his informed science background and grasp of Eastern philosophies to make some sense of a sometimes senseless world. By tapping into the timeless realm of the collective unconscious, where archetypes of light and shadow engage in the eternal struggle between good and evil, Keene has personified these forces in the fully developed and complex characters of Emaly and Roger, bringing them to life in the readers imagination. The author successfully juggles multiple plot lines, while simutaneously weaving narrative and dialog in a seamless flow of ideas, images,emotions and action that carry the reader aloft on the white wings of redemption and across the black abyss of the Permanox."
3,Bread and Roses,"I bought and paid for a NEW copy. I was shipped a USED copy with passages underlined in ballpoint. After waiting a month for a response I have not heard from the vendor.However, a good, readable introduction to the causes and beginning of the American labor movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
4,Love this chair!,Just bought two of these for my grandbabies to use when they visit. Fit easily onto our kitchen table and folds flat to fit in the carrying case. The material seems a little lightweight so we will have to see how it holds up over time but overall very easy to assemble and attach to the table.
4,Twins,I like the portability of the Regalo baby high chairs. I purchased these for my twin granddaughters.They were able to enjoy Christmas dinner at the table with us!
2,Poor quality fabric,Fabric is very thin. Bought for my 7 month old grandson but he likes to jump up & down while eating & I was afraid the seams would rip.
2,there are much better clip on chairs out there,"I was looking for a chair to use at grandma's house, and ordered this one. At home we use the Phil and Ted's Me Too everywhere we go, and love it in every way. We like to have the baby at the table with us. The Regalo is clunky, difficult to install, the fabric feels cheap, the baby sits too low and his head hits the metal piping on the top of the chair. He cries whenever I put him in it. This chair is going back."
2,Incomplete Packaging,The chair came with two left arms and cannot fold up as advertised. It's been nearly four weeks and I am still waiting for the manufacturer to make good on this error.
3,Regalo high chair good but confusing,"I am very pleased with the appearance and design of this high chair. I had to figure it out myself, as it came with no instructions or suggestions. One side of the back support tube will not insert into the upright lower tube frame. I might be able to ream out a bump inside the tube that prevents the back support tube from inserting. It appears this chair was returned from a previous customer, perhaps because it didn't work right, as I explained. If so, it should never have been resold.I do hope I can fix it. There might not be a better one in the market."
4,Hook on and eat outside,"The Regalo Hook-On High Chair is easy to clean and is very light and transportable. Ours is the dark blue. The fabric is easy to clean and is soft. The 5 point harness is simple to secure our daughter ( 23 months, 22 lbs.). The only problem that me and my wife have is tightening the screws to firmly secure the chair to the table. It can be a little ackward to tighten it. Overall we both love it and so does our daughter."
3,Doesn't fit table,"I received these chairs (I ordered 3), and was optimistic when I took them out of the package, but was so disappointed because they don't fit my round table. If they clear the skirting underneath, they aren't long enough to get the top handles on top of the table, and if I place them outside of the skirting, they are too short to reach the table top. I should have heeded the other reviews! So if I can't find someone to sell them to, I will have to return them. Disappointed, not in the product itself, but that it doesn't fit my pretty standard round table so is worthless to me. Product quality appeared average."
3,Worth the money,"So for the price you can't beat it. We recently replaced our Chicco hook on seat with this one. First of all it's almost like a big puffer coat but it's a chair. The back comes up pretty high and it's well padded with poof. The harness system is a bit over the top for an older toddler (nearly 2) since the back and sides are so high. But hey, safety is a good thing. It fit on our table fine. Your child does sit pretty close to the table however. If you use a rubber bid with the catch cup at the bottom it could hit the table! It's worth the money."
3,"Good Price, Not Best Quality","I purchased this to use at my in-laws house, and it works fantastically well. Apart from being a bit difficult to attach to the counter, it is very easy to place child in seat, and it is very secure. My only complaint is that within the first two uses of it, one of the knobs that's supposed to hold the chair backing in place pushed into the metal never to be seen again. This particular problem hasn't affected the chairs safety in any way, it just makes it annoying to set up."
4,A for function,"This chair is quite nice.We had the more expensive Chicco chair, but this is just as good for its purpose.This fits our table top because of its adjustable handles and doesn't make our kitchen/dining area look like a childcare.If you are on a budget. This is the one to get.Much better than those big bulky high chairs everyone uses.Only got 4 stars because there is no color choices."
3,table damage,I can find no configuration that would keep this chair from damaging my dining table. I am keeping it for use at picnics.
2,"Works, but Others are Much Nicer","I own this high chair and would not recommend it. If budget is a major constraint for you, then yes, it does work. But, it became well used looking and ragged far too soon. It doesn't fold up small enough to reasonably be carted to restaurants and kept in the car. It is small enough to haul to a friend's or relative's once in a while, though. It is too big to for airlining, as it would take up precious luggage space.I prefer the Chicco travel seats, or even better, the Phil and Ted's travel seat.Unlike other reviewers, I have to say, it DOES fit on skirted tables. My table has about a 4"" skirt and it works. However, getting it on is a puzzle. It's not a hard one, but the first time it took my a minute or two to figure out how to wiggle it just right to get it on.This is decent enough to be passed along as a freebie, but even with careful, limited use, it's not nice enough now to resell. :("
1,Unsafe! Dangerous! Beware!,"This past Sunday, our daughter (6months) fell out of the chair. The seat gave out and swung backwards so that she fell fowards, first hitting her chin on the table, then completely forward/down. Because she was strapped in, her legs were still in the harness and she was hanging upside down from the chair. She then continued to fall to the ground face first.The harness was propperly attached to the table and never moved. But the fabric that makes up the seat wraps around the harness via velcro, and the velcro became undone. I would really caution parents using this chair, we were scared to death when it happened. If you already own this chair, I would at least recommend re-inforcing the velcro on either side."
1,Don't Buy,"I also saw the great reviews and thought for the price this would work great. It's terrible!!! My 11 month old daughter, that only weighs 18 lbs. fell right through the seat within a couple of minutes. The sides are just attached by velcro....yep velcro. Luckily, we didn't trust this product and stayed right close just in case. Ya, we gave it the benefit that it was built better than it looked but it's not. It was also extremely hard to hook to my countertop (with no lip) and it didn't sit flush on top which means little fingers could get pinched. This product is getting sent back!"
1,Never used because the parts didn't fit together,"We got this as a gift of our amazon baby registry. I was excited about it because I want a hook on type high chair for our baby for home and maybe travel. However, we aren't able to use it because the parts don't fit together right. We are sending this back to amazon and looking for another one."
5,Great for small spaces!,"We have a small home and the highchair just took up too much space. This helps if your space is limited! It is also GREAT to take with you to restaurants (as to not use their dirty highchairs), relatives and it's just great because the baby is actually sitting at the table with you. My 6 month old son just loves it and so do we!"
1,"Cheap, but well...CHEAP","This chair has the right idea, but I guess you get what you pay for. The price seemed right. How bad could it be, right?We returned it. Don't buy it. Find the old dicontinued Graco Tot-Loc on ebay or at a consignment store and buy it no matter what you have to pay for it. You'll be glad you did. Even a used Graco is worth the extra money."
2,Better chairs out there...,"I ordered two of these chairs for my daughter's little ones. It does not say anywhere in the description that there cannot be a lip/skirt on the table. Of course both of my girls have lips on their tables so chairs will not work. I have the 'lobster' chair and I luv it! It too cannot have a lip or skirt on the table but my handy hubby rigged it so it was flush under the table and now it works awesome. These Regalo chairs cannot be rigged the same way. I find my 'lobster' chair made much better, sturdier and easier to clean. My daughter said when she plugged the one end of the arm into the chair to put it together, it scratched terrible....just don't think this chair is made as well as the 'lobster' chair. I guess you get what you pay for!!"
1,My Twins Hate It!,"Lots of reviews complained that the seat is flimsy, unsafe, and/or doesn't work. I have no issues with those - I feel it is a pretty sturdy seat, and I also believe that my babies are pretty safe in the seat. Problem is, they won't sit in it! Maybe I'm doing something wrong - it doesn't seem like other reviews are having this problem, but my babies are miserably slumped down in the seat and knock their head on the top support bar. They are able to sit independently and are average size 10-month-olds. They don't mind sitting in their regular high-chair at home, but the second we get these things out at a restaurant they start screaming. I'm so disappointed - I really wanted to use these to keep my babies out of filthy restaurant high-chairs and to have baby seats for visiting friends/family."
5,Couldn't Wait To Get It!,"This chair has made every dining experience relaxing and ejoyable since we purchased it. Most restaurants furnish high chairs without a tray that do not sit baby at table level either. Now our 10 month old can sit at table level with us while eating and he is comfortable, secrure and is not eating where many other babies have left their mess. I recommend it for portability-has fit on every table we have tried. At home our dining table has 4 inch border under the table top and the chair fits fine. We couldn't wait to get it and are very pleased we finally did! Have seen it at specialty stores for twice as much $$-Great price."
3,Not enough options out there,"This is the only hook-on high chair around, so I was pleased to get a good price on this product. As another reviewer noted, deep table aprons will block the pivoting bars. I measured and thought, why not try it: there are no other options out there. And she was right. This product will not allow the pivoting bars to pass under the table.I am going to keep it anyway. The seat will still sit securely when occupied. Many years ago, this type of seat was available without the pivoting bars securing the seat to the table. My babies had no problem with that seat.I'm disappointed that there's no flexibility in the kind of table on which this seat can be used."
2,Important info left out of product description,"This chair cannot be used on a table with a skirt that is wider than a few inches. It does not work on our farm house kitchen table, which has a five inch skirt, or on our dining room table. It works best on picnic tables or tables that are just an inch of so of flat surface sitting on four legs that are close to the center. This is very important information to disclose because many people have tables with skirts and this chair is useless in those cases. If it does not work on my sister's modern table, which does not have a skirt, I will return it. However, I have to disagree with another reviewer about the material. I was actually surprised at how sturdy it seems. Cannot comment on the quality of the straps, however, because I have been unable to attach it to a table."
1,Something's not right!,"My friend has this chair and we use it alot when we visit her for my son. Now we are having another baby, and I didnt want to buy another high chair, so I purchased this...when it came it appears to be manufactured incorrectly...the metal bars are welded on to the supports at the wrong angle, so therefor it doesnt work correctly...I am very displeased with this purchase and plan on returning it."
4,it fits,"I'm really I size 43 bust, but my bottom half is a little smaller. This suit fit well and is standing up fine to my fitness swimming. You can't beat the Amazon price, since Speedo is still selling this for almost $60!"
2,Largely Disappointing,"The book is really only useful for those interested in a literature survey, discussion of public policy, and somewhat tedious discussion of theoretical concepts."
2,Written by academics for academics!!!,"On balance, this book provides a good overview of the subject and of recent academic studies. However, it is often theoretical and ""ivory-towerish."" There is relatively little that really instructs the reader about transactions are actually done. A great deal of time is devoted to discussing why they occur, but little practical insight is provided as to the challenges and issues that must be resolved. This book may be suitable for someone who is curious and interested in reading about M&A but provides little guidance for those interested in learning how to undertake transactions."
3,Good,Webkinz are very fun but they get addictive once you go they make you go every day one game is just like a slot machine the website is very fun bot it barley works the londing takes forever. the site is not very educational there is just one game but no one really plays it.theese toys went from [...] to [...] wow and its even harder to get on the site. If yoy want a stuffed animal stay away. Usually the kids ignore the pet and focus on the webstie. but the worst part is thart there is one game on the website which involves shotting weapons DONT BUY this for kids under 7 yrs!!!!! its very hard to navagate the websit and can get innapropatie.
1,Sadly disappointing,"Having seen Gallagher's other videos, this is a lackluster performance in which he uses some routines from other shows. It's very disappointing. It appeared as though the audience was having some difficulty finding things to laugh at. He's done better work than this."
1,DO NOT BUY IT. HAS A MIND OF IT OWN.,"Needed a humidifier and did not do research thinking that nothing can go wrong with a simple product. I was wrong.-No controls, only switch is an on and off switch.-Water tank cap is sharp and difficult to open due to an overkill gasket.-Also the water tank could air bounds, on many occasion in the middle of the night I notice the unit is not working,so I pick up the tank and reinsert to allow water to flow back in the unit.-The transducer is very sensitive if it is too much water it will shut off and not work. On many occasion I had to empty some extra water from the unit into a bucket, then wait 10 minute for the unit to work.-The manual is very vague, and probably on purpose due to poor quality and design.If I did not throw away the box I would have returned it. Now I can't wait for it to breakdown, so I could buy a different unit from another company."
3,"Vitamins are Fine, Shipping Not So Much","I ordered these almost a year ago and I have no issues with the vitamins themselves. Kirkland is a brand we trust and we've bought these vitamins from the store and had no issues. However, this bottle was shipped in a flimsy plastic bag with NO padding whatsoever (unlike packages from Amazon that usually have too much padding). There was a dent in the bottle, but nothing else seemed wrong with it, and I didn't want to pay return shipping, so I kept it. Now I'm at the bottom of the bottle and I can see that there are many broken vitamins that settled at the bottom of the bottle. Do not buy from this seller unless they specify how they will ship the product. Wish I'd thought of that before."
5,Best alteration DVD ever!!!,"I am petite with a very full bust and sewing tops has been a nightmare until I purchased this DVD. Clear step by step instructions for altering MANY types of patterns to fit bust sizes larger than the standard ""B"" cup used by today's pattern makers. I am amazed by this video and definitely recommend it."
4,Good movie,"Good movie. Storyline is a little classic but characters are great, well played. The end happens too suddenly in my opinion. But too soon too ! ;) I love Moira Kelly and I advise every people who likes her to watch this movie !"
4,Important for any student of modern military history,The history of the German General Staff by Walter Görlitz was at times dry and difficult to read but that does not detract at all from the importance of this work. Gorlitz gives a complete history of the History of the German General Staff from its beginnings to its end in 1945. To truly understand German Military Strategy and operations you must have insight into what was the foundation to German Military thinking. This book gives you that insight. I was especially pleased with what I learned during the German preparation for the preparations for the Franco - Prussian War and WWI. I strongly recommend this book.
5,Great.,Easy to install. So far so good. I liked the length of this rail. These are hard to find in the stores.
3,good product but not what i needed,Product was fine but not what I ended up needing please note this does not work on toddler beds need at least a twin
2,Seemed great at first..,"I am really disappointed in this product. It seemed great..fairly easy to install and ok to travel with. HOWEVER, after just 2 1/2 weeks of use and one time traveling and putting back up, the plastic latch on one end doesn't work, which means that the rail WILL NOT STAY snug against the bed. Defeats the whole purpose. And, the top rail is leaning out slightly now, apparently from the hinge that folds up for travel (which was used properly). I am returning this an hoping to find something better. How hard is it to make a rail that is SAFE? Frustrating!"
3,Eh,Thought this movie was sub par at best. Acting 3rd rate. Story line 3rd rate. Disappointed I actually spend money on this movie.
3,When it comes to content...,"Gory subject matter. Hard to catch on to why we should care about the characters, and how their bizarre society works. Some of the casting choices were worth reconsidering."
3,meh,"Not as good as I had hoped. Cinematography was good, writing was okay, premise was not as interesting as it could have been."
3,Ehhh,"I both read the book and watched the movie. I wasn't really impressed by either to be honest. Katniss seems selfish and whiny to me. I know everyone seemed to have hunger games fever, but I'm just not sold. Overall I thought it was ok."
1,Failed to capture the essence of the book,"I was extremely disappointed with this film adaptation. It lacked important character development sequences, and haphazardly reassigned story details to other characters (seemingly at random), and new irrelevant sequences were added in. It is as if the screen writers only took an executive summary and tried to flesh it out."
1,Hunger Games Blu-Ray,You requested a review. The disc we received was defective (would not spin up in the Blu-Ray player) and had to be returned.
3,Ok movie,"Shipment was fast, the product was in great condition. The movie though was greatly over hyped. I guess I must have missed something pivotal or something."
4,different look into the future,"Having never read the book, the movie was completely new to me.Being an archer and hunter I found many interesting twists and turns that I would have never thought of. The clarity and color of the scenes were fantastic. Can't wait for the next film and no, I will not read the 2nd and 3rd books before I see them. The only reason that it did not receive a 5, is that some of the scenes were a little drawn out and slowed down the flow."
4,the hunger games movie,I have read all three books. The movie was ok but the books were better. I like the movie but there were things that the movie left out that will continue in the other books so that is why it wasn't given 5 stars.
3,Left me hungry,"Read the books, which were great. The film lacked depth and you don't really get a feel for whom the characters are or how bad they have it in the Districts. The books were action packed and the film was not. In fact it moved slowly with little action. Katniss was a survivor in the book and seemingly lucky in the film."
1,Kids killing each other...disturbing!!!,"I can't think of a horror movie I find more disturbing. It's incomprehensible that something like THIS is rated PG 13, but a naked body in a movie is a huge drama.I kept hoping the kids would find a way to take the excitement out of the slaughter and end the senseless yearly massacres for good, but they didn't. They just kept killing each other."
1,Unable to watch it on my PC.,"On the top right corner it says ""You own this videoHD movie playback is currently limited to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Roku or other Amazon Instant Video HD compatible devices.""I'm on a pc. My monitor is 1080p, my graphics card supports HD, my comp can do either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. I can watch other movies and shows on Amazon in HD but not this one? Also the promotion page says I have the option to download this video to a pc also yet I can't find a download link!"
3,If your a fan of movies like Twilight...,"If your a fan of movies like Twilight...you will like this movie..... geared towards young girls, I went into it not knowing this, and was ready to turn it off about 1/4 of the way through. So many holes in the story, and some really bad CGI (what were they thinking during the scene when they are paraded through the city on their chariot thingees... The CGI during that scene is laughable). It's a slow moving movie, and their are some real cheesy scenes. But, like I said, if your into the books (I didn't read them), and like cute boys and girls (teeny-bopper stuff), then you might dig it. I just hope and pray that ""Enders Game"", one of my favorite books of all time (and is currently in production and filming) doesn't get the twilight/hunger games effect.. ie geared towards kids... since Enders Game is about kids in general."
2,Thumbs Down,"After reading the book (which I loved), the movie was not impressive. Had I not read the book first, I wouldn't have known what was going on or why."
2,The Hype was overstated,"Because I never saw this in the theater, my views may be a bit subjective, but I honestly didn't care much for this movie. I bought the DVD because someone told me it was a ""must-own"" type of show. Perhaps my expectations were too great, but The Hunger Games failed to deliver in my opinion. I'll read the book. I know it deserves the hype."
2,weak story. over hyped. slow start,"After reading the book I shouldn't be surprised by weak movie. Donald Sutherland was completely unexplained, and poorly worked into script. The movie has a feel of the 80s movie Brazil which was cool, but sadly unlike Brazil this movie did not deliver. Will not watch sequels."
4,Very good movie!,"Movie was in great condition and very good movie, I watched this in the theater and again after receiving it, my teenage granddaughters and I watched it (2 x for me & once for them), enjoyed it."
5,excellent,This book will keep you wanting more. It will keep you up thinking what will happen next. I definitely recommend this book.
3,No character development,"Having not read the book, I didn't know what to expect. The ""Wonderlandish"" clothing styles was the first thing that keeps you from immersing yourself in the movie. But there was no character development nor did I feel or care for the characters. Close-knit relationships between characters seemed to come out of nowhere."
4,"Good movie but of course, not as good as the book",The movie was pretty good. But read the books first. Much more actioned packed and movie just wasn't as vibrant as the book allowed your imagination to go.
5,Excellent!,Very good movie. It really hooks you in. I would not normally watch this kind of movie but now I can't wait for the next one.
4,follows the book,"Movie follows the book, so if you enjoyed the book you'll like the movie. I don't usually read or watch futuristic type stories, but this was good."
5,Hunger for More,"This movie lived up to the hype, I will watch it again. The actors although young were believable and they didn't make a huge deal of explaining the future just got you going from minute one."
3,"Ok movie, but read the book so much better","I thought the movie was o.k., but I had the feeling that if I hadn't already read the book, the movie would not have made sense to me. Some characters lacked development, Cato for instance, in the book you really got the feeling he was evil/mean, not so much in the movie. The main characters were well played, and did a good job. The costumes/make up were well done, the scenes were good, but the whole movie felt rushed, espcially when they got to the actual games. I was hoping for more, I don't know, energy? It was just lacking something."
3,Movie was great but..,"The movie is great. However, it took forever to receive the product. Then, when it finally arrived and we were watching it, it skipped multiple times and we had to restart."
3,Hunger,"This is a so-so book. I bought it since I was hearing ""hunger Games"" all over the television ... Is this book foreshadowing American society? Is it a call to rebellion? ... You tell me"
3,The Hunger Games Blu-Ray,First I must point out that the movie was a very good portrayal of the book. The video was excellent as well as the sound. The major problem I had was that it took almost 2 minutes to load the Blu-ray and then it just stopped running and I had to restart the disk and wait 2 minutes again. Once the movie started I did not have any more issues. This problem was repeatable; if you did not select play fast enough it would lock up. The Blu-ray also did not let me jump to the main menu. I had to wait for all the pre-view stuff to finish to just get to the main menu. This is unacceptable for a disk I purchased. Overall the movie was very good I only wish the Blu-ray authoring was better.
4,"If you read the books, you'll enjoy.","The movie was awesome...if you have read the books. I have read the entire trilogy, but my sister had not read any of the books, and she had to ask me a lot of questions to figure out what was going on. The books are MUCH more in depth."
4,Good movie but has a bit of tokenism,"I liked watching this movie, there were some interesting underlying statements. The ending,however, was predictable. There was insufficient background on the ""parachutes"" and how and who got them (should have expanded on that aspect), you will have to see it to understand this comment.There was some tokinism I did not appreciate, but all in all I liked it. Not worth seeing twice."
4,the hunger games,"as most movies made from book,the book is always better. because in a book you can feel what writer is saying,if you had not read books would have been a 5 star, once the games started hard to get up and get ur popcorn,didnt want to miss anything,do think it is to bad when the movie makers find the need to change parts of very good books,but i would recomend this movie,good enough to watch again,now gotta wait for next one by then will have forgotted what book was about."
5,Hunger Games DVD,"Loved the books and the movie. Was introduced to these fantastic stories by my 12 year old granddaughter. Had to buy her the video. Waiting for continuation of the videos. Very good telling of the original story. A few changes, but they worked well."
4,excellent,It was an interesting concept. I worry about all the violence in movies today and why it has become so fascinating to us all.
5,Read the books - watch the movie!,"My daughter couldn't wait to own ""The Hunger Games"" movie. She read the books multiple times and saw the movie in the theater. This movie is an excellent adaptation of a complicated book with an extremely dark theme. I read the books myself several months before watching the movie (at home) and must say that many of the finer points in the movie would be lost on a person who hadn't read the books."
5,Absolutely Riveting!,I read the book now I have seen the movie and I am not disappointed. It is beautifully done. The actors picked for the roles fit perfectly. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a perfect film.
3,Poor as a Movie,If you haven't read the book you won't understand a lot of the details of the story. I watched this movie with someone that had read the book and they kept having to fill in major details that I feel should have been included. I think the director crammed in all the action scenes and left out too much backstory and as a result the plot falls flat.In my opinion a movie based on a book is never as good as the book but a movie should be able to stand on its own merits and the bottom line is that The Hunger Games does not.
1,Disturbing,I thought it was disturbing that people could find entertainment in something like this. The story was sad. In a world where we have violent school shootings and we find those things so terrible it is amazing to me that people could sit down and find enjoyment from children in the same age range brutally killing each other. I also had a hard time with the enjoyment the people had while they watched the killings and how worked up they got over it. Maybe I missed the point of the whole movie? Maybe I was just distracted by the brutality and far fetched costumes.
3,Ho hum,"Not really bad, not very good. Donald Sutherland was awful, but, then, most of the acting---no, all of the acting---was weak. Jennifer Lawrence was like a zombie in overplaying the grimness of her situation---which was grim. Harrelson came to closest to giving a good performance. I got through it, but barely."
3,Definitely not as good as the books,"Read the books and loved them! Thought this movie would be great, but it was a let down. I thought it was slow moving and just went through the motions."
3,The book is always better,"I don't know what it was about the movie, but it just didn't move me like reading the book did."
2,Running man/Battle Royale copy,The movie it's OK. But the concept is only a copy of Battle Royale with details of Running Man. If you like that movies you can enjoy this one but don't expèct something original.
4,High Drama,"Very good.... Story is good along with the acting...lots of action and high drama. Well worth the money. Special effect is so so but overall, good."
3,Pretty good,"Book was much better, but always is, isn't it.... I expected more after all the hullabaloo. Still worth seeing so you can converse on the subject."
2,Still Hungry,"The acting was first class. The storyline was sick. Lord of the Flies was a much better, and more realistic movie."
5,The Hunger Games,"I missed going to see this movie in the theater, so I was anxious to see it when it came out on DVD. I had a pleasant surprise before the DVD arrived, when after I purchased the DVD, I received an instant video from Amazon. I watched it from my computer 2 days before the DVD arrived (and twice since receiving the DVD). The movie was excellent and I would recommend this movie. I am looking forward to the next movie."
4,Better than I anticipated,"This movie, of course, got a lot of hype when it was in theaters; for that reason I avoided it. I read the book in a day. I should know better to read the book then see the movie as they always lack the details the book allows. However, all in all, I thought the movie was good."
4,Waiting for the sequel,The movie is good as a stand alone story. I have read the books and knew that some of the minor details were not as they happened in the book. Still it is an entertaining movie.
4,close to the book but needs a bit more,I thought they did a great job translating the book to film. The casting was spot on. The video and audio quality are reference. My only complaint is that there should have been a few exta minutes devoted to Kat's struggle over what to do about the feigned romance - the film makes it seem more comfortable for her than was actually so.
2,Hunger Games,Why would I want to watch a film about kids killing each other!! It's inhumane! I don't understand why people like this kind of thing.
4,Good,"Good, not as good as the book, but that's to be expected. Its got action and a bit of love I guess. It wasn't bad and if you want to see it just to see it, I'd say it wouldn't be a waste."
3,Good but not great,"After reading the hunger games series I was extremely excited to watch the film. But I must say, it was a decent attempt, but as usual the book is far better than the movie. I don't know if the production company thought showing children involved in the violence of the book would be upsetting to the Viewers or if they were shooting for a younger target audience like Harry potter, but the film lacks the edge of your seat feel that you get from the book. The moments of hopelessness, the pain, the transformation from human to beast of survival is not apparent in the movie. Like I said, a good attempt. Just lacking on some key elements in my opinion."
4,Great Movie,"Read the trilogy. As everyone knows, when you read the book first the movie is ussually a dissappointment. Not so in this case. The movie managed to capture the essense of the book--the ""feel"" so to speak. Jen Lawrence was perfect as Katniss--totally nailed it. Woody Harrelson absolutely great as the mangy, cynical, secretly wise Haymitch. I wasn't too crazy about the kid who played Peeta--very bland and he's supposed to be better looking. They also changed around a few things that I thought would be fine left the same way as the book. But they put more emphasis on the head game keeper, and showing how the games are manipulated, than the book did and that was cool! All and all, really liked it."
4,pretty true to the book,"Very close to the book, but lacked her thoughts. If you didn't read the book you wouldn't understand what she's faking for the cameras and stuff like that."
3,Boringly Unimaginative,"Even the basic premise of this futuristic movie is boring. The lower exploited class (ressembling Appalachian coal miners) who rebelled unsuccessfully once before, are now punished and suppressed by having a few chosen representatives forced to participate in a life & death televised game. This story has been told many times before in sci-fi. Please.. please give us something new ... or WE will rebel!"
4,The Hunger Games movie,"The movie is great. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of ""back story"" and character development that is present in the book."
3,Over rated,Don't know what all the hype was about. Just an OK. movie. Ending disappointing. Nothing done to stop the killing of these children/teens. I would have liked an uprising of the people to stop the system and see the downfall of the the elite people responsible for it. The audience would have cheered. Good guys win.
3,Too much left out of the story,"I read the book and then saw the movie. If I hadn't read the book I would have been lost about all the drama that's supposed to be going on. The movie is ok by itself, it just misses so much detail that the book provided that I was disappointed with it. I think that they should have taken book one and made two movies. That way they wouldn't have had to leave most of the plot, and great acting, on the cutting room floor. Two movies, each at least two hours long, would have helped the actors to put the plot together. There was just too much missing from the movie that you need to understand what's going on at a personal level. Hope they do better with the next ones."
2,Amazon dropped me from HD to lower quality 20 minutes into the movie - Netflix NEVER did that!,Movie was very disappointing after reading the book. No character development at all - you didn't feel anything for the characters. Should have skipped the control room scenes (which were NOT in the book) and concentrated on what WAS in the book.
3,Good Movie,"I was a good movie, but I thought it would have been better than what it was considering all the hype."
4,Good but disappointing,"When I saw the movie in theaters, I hated it. I had just reread the book and all of the details were fresh in my mind. The movie changed some details for no apparent reason, e.g. Peeta gets a syringe -- not ointment -- for his leg in the book. I liked the movie better the second time but it's still disappointing to me. It seems much more bland than the book. The arena isn't nearly as terrifying as you might expect. Katniss is supposed to almost die of dehydration, but the movie makes it seem like she finds water instantly.The movie feels like you have to comprise, but I would say it's still worth watching."
4,Of course - it wasn't as good at the book,"the hard thing is, the book is about 50% about the character's thoughts...which is really hard to portray in a movie. so they did a good job with what they had to work with. but a vast majority of the story was lost"
1,Never watch again,"I will never watch this movie again!! The subject of children killing children, even though they are older children, is not my idea of entertainment!"
4,Coal country,One view of a portion of American society. A rather depressing story. Coal country in the movie has changed little since the 40s. I hope the future holds better promise than that portrayed by the decadent society in the movie.
1,"Disc didn't play correctly, but a great movie","Let me start by saying that the movie was fabulous- no problem there. However, the movie/disc got ""stuck"" when Katniss was in the tree and we had to go back to the main menu and start again at the next chapter. I returned my copy frustrated because I felt like we had missed something important. The copy I later bought at Wal-mart did the same thing. (And yes, I tried the discs in multiple DVD players.) my second copy went back too. You would think that with a movie this big someone would have checked to make sure the discs worked."
3,Hungry for some emotional investment in this movie,"I chose an okay rating for this movie because I read the book. Perhaps, had I not read the book and seen the movie I would have liked it better? The thing about the book was the frightening urgency of some of the situations the tributes found themselves in, and the compelling empathy it evoked in me for the characters. The movie didn't scratch the surface to develop that connection at all. I did, however, like the eye into the gamemaker's studio and the interference his panel of technicians could inflict upon the tributes in the arena... well done. The portrayal of the capitol district people was splendid with their extravagant and bodacious costumery(is that really a word?) and pageantry. In the end, these two things are what elevated my rating to okay. I felt as dispassionate for the children in the arena as the capitol district viewers in the movie."
2,A Blatant Rip-Off (sorry),"It's not a new thing for western artists to steal from eastern movies/books and pawn them off as their own, knowing that the larger audience will never know. HUNGER GAMES has just TOO MANY elements from the 2000 Japanese film(and book) BATTLE ROYALE. While HUNGER GAMES entertains and has been very popular, I just wish the larger public could see what I believe is the source material.BATTLE ROYALE is a classic- a metaphor for the cut throat, hyper-competitive state of Japanese education, and the state of today's youth casting off and rebelling against traditional Japanese culture. Make BATTLE ROYALE and HUNGER GAMES a double feature. Should make for great conversation after!"
3,Okay,Used the streaming option to rent the movie. Streaming was smooth and great HD Quality. Movie was okay. Seemed it lacked something. Hope part 2 is better. Great fx and sound.
5,Hunger Games,"This is one of my favorite books and I had preordered the movie after i saw it in theaters. And a few days after it came out on sale I already had the dvd. Amazon's delivery's are fast and very reliable, and I was able to track my order"
5,Excellent Movie,"My daughters and I all read the trilogy (books) over a 1 week time period and found them to be quite excellent. We then proceeded to see the movie at the theater to determine how closely it would follow the book (not an easy task by any means due to its complexity). Of course the book was much more detailed, providing the history and background of the events leading up to the present day etc., I have to say they did a rather good job with the movie. I like how they pulled it together and allowed you to follow the story line event though you may not have read the book first. However, once you see the movie, you will definitely want to read the books. I would highly recommend doing so."
3,Great movie but bad DVD,"I love this movie. I love this book. I love that Amazon gave me the digital copy free with my order(only reason that it is a 3 and not a 2)...but there are no deleted scenes, I'm sorry but that's a real deal breaker. This DVD should be a 2, it's a 3 for Amazon, but it's really a 2. It needs something extra, something that makes it worthwhile. 2 minutes of extra footage would have made this a 5...I only bought it because I'm addicted to the series."
3,Hunger Games: Not About Games,"The film Hunger Games is about a culture that condemns part of its population to poverty and forces that part to offer some of its youth into a homicidal contest (the Hunger Games) where only one individual can survive. The popularity of this film is surprising, considering the pictured varieties of mayhem visited upon the kids. Although I felt that the acting was excellent and the heroine survived, the movie left me feeling sad."
4,Great Babysitter,I rented this movie for my Granddaughter to watch on a road trip. She did not say are we their yet once.
4,Worthwhile viewing; kept my interest!,"I really enjoyed the movie. I did read the book first; so I realize there is so much they can't put in the movie due to time. But, all in all, I feel it was definitely worth the money!"
3,False advertisement about the Ultra-Violet Copy. It's a lie!,Be for warned about this particular package reguarding this movie. It states that you will be able to download a Ultra-Violet copy to you account in the cloud. THIS IS FALSE and a LIE! You will only be able to use you code for the iTune download even though it says that you can choose to do either. VUDU.com doesn't have this movie available yet for Ultra-Violet.
3,"I liked it, but...","This is an ok movie, but it is nowhere near as good as the Japanese original. Having seen Battle Royale first, I can see where Hollywood chopped up the story to make it more ""acceptable"" to American consumers (but they were wrong)."
2,"A long, boring, plodding stinker","This is plodding, predictable film making at its worst, with a bad script, silly costumes, and were it not so truly amateurish and awful, you might even discern how truly revolting its theme is -- the idea of children killing other children for sport. Great, just what we need at a time when maniacs are running loose with guns in this country randomly shooting people. Not even worth a rental. This one's a paint-by-the-numbers snooze."
5,An excellent adaptation of the book!,"I read the first book several times and was looking forward to seeing the movie. The movie was not a disappointment. Sometimes the movie is so different from the book that you wonder how it could have changed so much, but in this case the changes were so minor that the essence of the book remained intact. Anyone who read the book will be pleased with the movie and will look forward to seeing the next two."
3,Was not terrible. Had High Expectations. Disappointed.,"I was hoping for more action rather than dopey adolescent value references. Why are any one of these youngsters any better than others? Because it is written that way. So, we are suppose to identify with the ""better"" people. Fooey!"
5,Best Movie I've Ever Seen,"Wow. The Hunger Games is an amazing movie. I was priviliged to see it twice and look forward to hopefully seeing it again! It has slight language but not too bad. If you have read the books, they of course like all movies have to do, you will realize that they left some content out, but they do a nice job on not making the figting scenes too graphic. I will remind you that if you haven't read the book first, you need to because if you don't, in the movie,you could be possibly confused on what is happening during the storyline. It was a fantastic book and the movie is great too! I highly recoomend this product."
2,The Hunger Games,Sillyl premise and boring. I don't know why it got the rating it did. I have nothing more to say.
4,Fun movie,I enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't call it a great work but it kept me entertained for a coupl hours.
4,Hunger Games,Definately liked that they didn't use bunch of tern crazed strs but sad that so much from the book was change and/or left out.
2,Not my type of movie,"As I am an older gentleman, this was more of a teen type of adventure in my opinion. I really like action movies the best , but this one was more science fiction than anything. If she would have shot the President, it would have been a better ending. I will definitely pass this along to my Grand daughter."
4,entertaining,this movie was fun the kids enjoyed the book so we watched it together while not as good as the book the movie made a good try of it.
4,Good when playing,"Very good except the movie experienced two annoying periods where nothing was playing but a countdown clock. :(. Picture quality was good, and ease of ordering was also good. But pauses are very discouraging!"
5,movie,we really enjoyed the hunger games and will watch it many more time in the future. It will become a classic
5,Good adaptation of the book,"I was a little hesitant to watch the movie because I had heard that it was not a great adaptation of the book, but I think they did a pretty good job hitting on the key parts from the novel. Some of the action scenes seemed very forced but overall a good movie."
5,Christmas gift,"As a reading teacher, I prefer to read the book before watching the movie. Fortunately, my daughter agrees with me."
5,Story line was immaginative and new,Wife and I enjoyed the movie. The story line was unique and the acting and production was good. I would highly recommend it; however the themes are not for children
5,Hunger Games MOvie,"My 12 year old son rented this movie and really liked it. He liked it so much he wanted his mother to watch it. Being 46 years old, his mother was not so interested in watching it, but I finally gave in and watched it and LOVED it!!!"
5,The Hunger Games,Quality of the movie was good. No interruptions during the movie. Easy to download. Enjoy watching on my kindle fire or computer
2,None of the characters looked hungry to begin with.,"I finally rented The Hunger Games. There's two hours of my life I will never get back. Horrible cinematography (would have liked at least ONE steadycam shot), the viewer was not given a chance to feel much of the emotion (which means no emotional inventment at all), and, finally, unlike the book, I didn't really want Katniss and Prim to win.I will not watch the rest of them. Oh, and by the way, Mr. Director of Photography, give your people room to BREATHE. Closeups and dirty-overs were so restrictive (and there were too many of them), that the whole thing could have been filmed at the park across from my High School (which is one block square). I give it 2 stars out of 5. The second star is to fatten the one-star, because not a single character looked hungry to begin with."
3,Read after,This was a really good movie if you read the book after it. To answer the voids they left in the movie. But like most movies that come from books the books are usually better.
3,hunger,Movie was slow like the book and I nodded off a few times. I wish I had watched before buying
1,Do not watch if you read the book,This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time. I have read the book and this movie misses allot of key things that happened in the book. Don't get me wrong this would be a good movie if you have not or never will read this book but if you have just avoid this one.
4,The Hunger Games,"So I read the books before I watched the movie, and while the books were amazingly well written, I preferred the movie because I was not as horrified. Yet again movies somehow managed to gloss over the sheer depravity of human kind and turned it into a form of entertainment."
5,Good film,"I am a grown man, and like this movie. My wife forced me to watch it, but was surprised I really enjoyed it."
2,Hunger games,I was a bit disappointed with this movie the story lagged on and the action was short for my taste was hoping for more of a story.
4,Hunger Games,"the whole family enjoyed this movie, most the movies when we rent we relied on reviews, the reviews were good"
4,Very Good Movie.,This movie was better than I expected. Most of what I heard was that it was a girl's movie. Not true at all.I cannot wait for the next release in the series.
4,nice escape,"this is a nice move about teenage heros. The movie missed a lot of detail that was in the book, but did convey the essesnce of the plot;teenagers can be brave,strong heros. nice movie for an evening at home with family. the costumes are great. really enjoyed this movie, looking forward to the next."
4,Hunger Games DVD,We enjoyed the movie but weren't as impressed with it as to what we expected after all the media hype that preceeded the movie. It was a good movie though.
2,Too simple,Simple and predictable story line. Characters are poorly developed. I would not watch it the 2nd time. g gy dtd
2,It was out of my age range,"I recommend this movie to today's youth. I'm 42 and the loud music and unnecessary violence didn't appeal to me. But 13-25, go for it! It's a living video game!"
1,item arrived damaged and not as described,I should have checked the movie when it arrived so that is my fault. But it was a gift for my son so I just wrapped it.The disc was not viewable. It was scratched and almost broken. It also did not come with the digital copy or a second disc.Not at all what I thought I was buying.
2,Disappointing,"If I had not read the book first I would have been lost as the main topics jumped from highlight to highlight. The choppiness reminded me of DUNE, the one with Sting, only able to be followed after reading the book. I hope the remaining 2 films are better done.Read the books. They are much better than the film."
4,The Hunger Games,Great movie. A lot of suspense and I loved that Katniss was the heroine! Jennifer Lawrence did a great job of playing her. Am going to watch it again.
3,"Broach not included, , disappointing",For all the hype the movie was kinda slow. Neat concept just not to exciting. Somewhet over-priced for what you got in the package.
4,Solid,"Good adaptation of the book, glas Collins had so much input. Excellent casting choices (for the most part). Solid performance for theyou small budget. Looking foreward to the other two movies."
4,It keeps your atttention.,"I never read the books, so I was not knowing what to expect. It was very entertaining. The set up for the next one was a little heavy-handed, but I can't say that I'm surprised."
3,Wish we could give 1/2 start ratings.,"It was close to the book and was interesting. My husband, who didn't read the story, liked it. It did end totally different from what I was expecting and the action was goosed up for the film. Not exactly the story line, but close enough. Will probably watch the rest of the series."
3,Rental Quality,"Not a bad movie, but i am definately glad I only rented it for $1.99 instead of dishing out $20 bucks to see it at the movies."
4,hunger games,"Starts off choppy but cinematography improves. Not too different from book which is good. If you haven't read the book it's probably two or three stars, if you have it's 4. Thoroughly enjoyed watching. Character development isn't fantastic, but it's juvy lit. Acting was good enough to elicite the suspention of disbelief. Looking forward to the sequel."
4,The hunger game,"The Hunger Game wasnt quite what I expected it to be, but before I commit to a review,I'll watch it again just to be fair."
4,The Hunger Games!,Better than I thought it would be. It differed greatly from the book though. Still a great movie!! Cant wait for the next one!
1,dont wast your time,"The whole premise of the movie is toatal garbage. The only reason i can see that this series is popuar with kids is the author/creator has an iq in the same bracket as children. Very little imagination went into the actual plot, it was all spent on stupid clothes and... and i dont know where the rest of it went. I also didnt believe any of the acting, but thats because they used worthless actors. All around an absolute piece of rubbish."
5,The Hunger Games - Bluray,"""The Hunger Games"" is one of the best movies we have watched in a very long time. My husband & I have already watched it 4 times--a record for him--he usually does not watch a movie more than once. I would have rated it higher if I could have.With Amazon, I got this movie for an acceptional price. Thanks Amazon."
1,Just Not My Cup of Tea...,"The basic premise of killing innocent children to insure one's own survival was just too macabre for me. Most of my friends seemed to enjoy the book, however."
3,decent movie,"predictable in a lot of ways. It seems to say that the government is a controlling manipulative bunch of 1%'ers who take advantage of everyone else. like I said, predictable."
1,Something's wrong.,All the buzz was for nothing. I'm a huge fan of action and quest movies. But this one was such a disappointment.
3,Dark but good Story...,I did rate it 4 star then I changed it to 3. The reason being is that it is so dark. I had to change my tv settings to make the color vivid. Otherwise I like the book and enjoyed the movie even though the movie did all match up with the book. But what do you expect most movies are like that.
3,This is Not for KIDS,It is not that I didn't like the quality of the Movie but how can this be for young adults. This movie is about children going out and killing children. And in the wake of all the school shootings that has happen over the last couple of years I'm not so sure why this is so popular. I wouldn't let my children see this movie. I was quite sad to see!
5,Could not put it down,"I was reluctant to read this book based on the subject matter. The idea of kids killing eachother was really disturbing. When I finally did pick it up, I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 books in a week and a half. Highly recommended!"
2,hunger games,People need to stick to the books I do not recommen this movi this movie for anyone under anyone under 15 I was disap I was disappointed in this movie
3,The Hunger Games,"I bought this for my girlfriend since she really likes the books and this movie. I haven't read the books, however I thought this movie was decent. The acting was alright and the story line was interesting. My biggest complaint against this movie would be the action scenes. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield during some of the most intense parts of the movie (for those who don't know, Cloverfield is a movie filmed via camera phone or camcorder so it is very shaky)."
2,MEDIOCRE..,"After reading the reviews for this movie , I had high expectations.Unfortunately, the first part of the movie reminded me of watching the Wizard of OZ.With all the crazy colored hairdo's, swirling beards and mustaches,and the most uncanny people.And of course there was the character that played Dorothy, traveling through the woods,being poisoned, then falling asleep on the ground.(wow...just like in OZ)During the forest scenes,I was expecting the Wizard,to come out from behind the curtain at any moment,and give Dorothy a bow.This may have been a good movie had they left out some of the corny resemblances to OZ.Not impressed."
3,HUNGER GAMES,I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I AM HOPING THAT THE OTHER MOVIE IGOT FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT WON'T BE A WASTE.
4,Misses the mark ... a little,"The movie version of "" The Hunger Game "" is quite good ... but misses being a great movie by steering away from the book . Yeah , I know , it is very difficult to follow the book exactly . It would make the movie too long , The thing is ... the additions to this might total 8 to 12 minutes total . The character Haymitch was cast wrong ( sorry Woody ) Somebody a bit mored ... "" Gruff "" should have been cast . The music was good ... Prim was good ... Peeta was better than expected ... Katniss was strong but not as athletic as I expected ... It seems like I didn't like the film ... But I did . It was a good job but I wqas hoping for a bit better ... The Avengers spoiled me ."
4,Well done movie. Good feature rich combo pack.,"Faithful to the book (although by nescessity abridged).Blu ray is spectacular AV experience, love the ease of the digital copy. Never looked at the 3D copy."
4,Pretty good adaptation,"I loved these books, even though I know that the book version is always better than the movie, I couldn't resist! This movie was really good! Some things that were changed or deleted I can understand, but others I can not.I would say that the overall ""feel"" of the book remains intact. Looking forward to seeing what happens in the sequels!"
4,Good Flick,"Not a bad movie, even if the makeup is a bit over the top. Woody does a good job as usual. Worth ordering to stream."
4,The HUnger Games,"Excelente disco, la película muy buena, llego antes de lo esperado directo a la dirección de mi trabajo en Perú. Lo único malo es que los extras están sin subtitulo, por los demás muy bueno."
5,SECOND GLANCE,"I devoured the books in The Hunger Games trilogy and anxiously awaited the movie release.Upon seeing it, although the cast was perfect (yeah, yeah, the literary Katniss looks nothing like Jennifer Lawrence, but Jennifer IS Katniss), I was kind of disappointed. I thought key plot points were missing, and what was up with those holographic hounds taking the place of the scary-as-all-hell genetically engineered dead tributes/hounds??? That said, I knew I was going to purchase the DVD. I preordered the movie in Blu-ray, and I viewed it 2 days after receiving it. It is a revelation. The colors are sharp and clear and vibrant, the wonderful soundtrack soared through the speakers, the action was well-defined and exciting. I was sucked in like I hadn't been in the theater, and like the books, did not want it to end. This is why they make DVD's in Blu-ray format, and this makes a classic addition to my movie library. And I haven't gotten to the extras yet!"
4,Loved It!,"Great movie to sit down and watch on a inactive day, another strong female lead. I can't wait for hunger Games part 2."
4,"Good, but not great","This is a 4, all because of the limited character development. I like the movie, but other than the two lead roles, I really felt zero connection with any of the other characters. They make you feel as tho you are supposed to care when someone dies for example, but they kill them off before they develop the character."
4,liked it more than i expected.,"I thought The Hunger Games was a pretty good movie, and I liked it more than I thought I would have. Jenniffer Lawrence was great as Katniss, I loved the actresses who played Prim and Rue, and the actors who played Haymitch, Cinna, Caesar were spot on. The only performance I did not like was Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. I think the fight scenes were a little rushed."
5,the hungrf games,great movie it could come true if rommney wins the election in november 2012 he could be in charge of the games.
5,Terrific Movie,We saw this movie 4 times in the theaters and so had to have it when it came out on DVD.
4,"Great movie, better than the book","Kids have really enjoyed this movie. It streamed wonderfully. Nearly as good as watching the Blu-Ray. The only disadvantage being you have neither extras nor subtitles. Movie added a lot the book glossed over adding depth to the characters missing in the book. In some ways the movie was better, in other the book was better. Combined they are wonderful. Suggest reading before watching."
2,Poor rendition of Nobel,"Movie did not reach expectation based on novel. Lead actors were ok, but plot wasn't well established. Character interaction was weak."
5,The Hunger Games,"I enjoyed the entire primess of the move and am looking forward to the next installment. I have only watched twice, however this month is not over yet."
2,Awful,Follows the story but leaves a lot to be desired in developing relationships between characters. Shaky camera is awful and she in no way looks like she's scraping by or had a hard life.
2,Dont get the hype,I wanted to see this movie but after doing so I asked myself why ? I found it boring. To me it just didnt live up to the hype. Glad I watched it on demand and didnt pay full ticket price at movies would have wanted a refund.
4,Great Movie. Even Better book,"I do not have much to say except that this is a great movie but it is missing a lot of the emotion and struggles the books had. I still think it's a great movie to watch. Also, this movie is in no way the same and ""The Running Man"" or ""Battle Royale."" They may have similar ideas but they are not the same and this is no rip off.An apple and an orange are both fruit and stem off a tree but they are not alike in tastes or in texture or in color, etc. Just give it a chance. You won't regret it."
4,Excellent Movie,"Though I have heard people say that the movie does'nt do the book justice, this was a great movie. I am also going to explore the claim that the movie does not compare to the book."
5,Awesome!,"I really loved the Hunger Games movie. There were a few things from the book that didn't make it in the movie, but there always is. I thought it was a great representation of the book with perfect casting. Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, and Elizabeth Banks were all especially perfect for their parts. & Josh Hutcherson did a great job as Peeta, as well. It was solid all the way around, and I can't wait for the second one to come out next Nov.!"
2,Not bad but too much in common with another book/movie,The book and movie bear a lot of situations with a book/movie out prior to this. Check out Battle Royale by Koushun Takami.Battle Royale: The Novel
4,hunger games,"i loved this book and was very excited about the movie. When I saw it at the theater I liked it a lot... It just isn't a movie I will watch over and over. I believe the excitement around the books and now movies is worth the hype so if you have not seen it, it's a must see for sure."
4,"Great Book, Good Movie","The Hunger Games series was great, but as in all movies, things had to be left out. But it was a very good movie anyways. I recommend watching it if you never read the book."
3,Not what I expected,"More for a younger group of people, acting was okay, storyline was good, I think it's just more for teens than for me..."
3,Best for Young Adults,"Haven't read the book, but the film is a preposterous future fantasy death game for young adults. Lots of emotional issues and such to grapple with. Sort of a combination of Lord of the Flies and The Running Man. Young adults would probably like it."
3,pretty good but...............,"First of all, Hollywood really needs to rethink endings of films, they seem to {nowadays} like to leave the endings to your imagination, which some people like, I don't, I prefer it left fully concluded, like the series ""Alien"", sequels were made, but every movie had a solid ending. Anyway, the movie was decent enough, I could pick it apart, but no need, I'm not a critic, it's worth a watch, just not a blockbuster in my opinion."
4,Not Bad,"After all the hype, this movie was much better than I thought it would be. Much credit to Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. They brought out the substance in their respective characters."
1,Read the online version.,"The book is poorly edited, the reference notes are not included and it's the same old version from 2007, nothing new. The price of the book is quite expensive for something you could read online or even print it."
1,the flip,The phone itself is very sleek however the quality of the phone is terrible. Just like most of the negative reviews I have trouble with the flip going in and out. The only suggestion was to but the flip part which indeed will be more than the phone cost me. That is ridiculous. I think the phone is nice looking but I wouldn't recommend for anyone purchasing a new phone. Overall I am dissatisfied and feel as though I was tricked. THe phone sucks.
1,very disappointing,"The very first book of Sidney Sheldon's that I read was ""The Other Side of Midnight"" and from that point forward I was hooked on writing. I always enjoyed the strong female characters and the way he wove the story together. I must have read the first few novels of his 10 times each .... You cannot compare this book to his earlier novels. He may have just needed the paycheck or has a vendetta against trees. The typical strong female characters are not in this book. Good plot twists & backstabbing family members are also missing.This book is very predictable and not written all that well. I was a Sheldon fan for a very long time and I must say that this book has turned me off to his writing. Maybe if I go back and read ""Morning, Noon, and Night"" again it would change my mind. Turn off the light because this book is just not that good."
2,OOPS! Wrong book!,"If you are looking for a fast and well writen book, that's OK. But don't expect much more than that. That old style is lost in a completely absence of subject and content.The absurdity of the plot envolving the two heroines is the book weakness.You may perfectely skeep it."
1,Waste of paper,"First and foremost I would like to say that I am an avid Sheldon reader, and If Tomorrow Comes is still on my best sellers list.That being said, I do not recommend this book to anyone. If you are a moderate reader, you probably have read most of the mini-storylines in other works. In my opinion, Sheldon has simply added ideas from here and there and come up with a sub-standard, cliched filled book. Also the end plot is completely unbelievable and left me feeling like I had wasted my time reading this work. Sidney you can do better than this."
2,Not One of his Best,"I'm a big fan of Sheldon's- having read all his books in the past. This is not one of his better reads, I am sad to say. The storyline is too simplistic, the characters are not believable and the ladies get out of EVERY assassination attempt with ease. I found myself shaking my head after many of these 'get aways'.For me a book is good if I can imagine the scene and place myself in it. This never happened with Are You Afraid of the Dark. It's all just a lot of fluff. I know it's onlya fiction book, but I know Sheldon can do better. He just didn't this time."
5,Excelent for any other author,"This book was great, extradoniary, fast paced, and intriguing, with a great concept to boot. The only problem is it isn't up to par with Sidney Sheldon. I could be as bold as to say, any other writer, this book would be gold, but sheldon, it seemed to be just average. Still a great book, and everyone who likes to read any type of thriller will love this book."
1,Disappointing,"I rarely ever write a review but after reading this book, I feel that I must write one to dissuade people from wasting money on it. I picked up the book from my university's library on the reputation of the author.However, it was a complete waste of time with illogical plots and actions by the characters who weren't fleshed out realistically. I'll still give one of his older books a try but I must say this book was very disappointing for me. A complete and utter waste of my 2 hours. I'm just glad it's from the library and not my pocket."
3,I love a Good Murder Mystery,"I really do. It has been years since I have read a Sidney Sheldon book. I think I was a little scared by the last one I read, but then again that was at least 15 years ago. So I got this one on the Kindle through the library. It only took a couple of days to read, I really couldn't put it down. Here are the things I didn't like. I don't get the title with this story. One character was afraid of the dark. I think that there could have been a few things left out for this to be a great story, without all the extra hoopla added. So all these people are killed and everyone thinks that its accidental, but something just doesn't seem right. All these people work for the same company. So why were they killed and why is the killer now after their family. What kind of work were they doing and why did they have to be killed for it. Will the wives be able to find out why their husbands were killed and be able to save their own lives in the process?"
2,Like a B grade movie.,My first book from this author and if the rest are like this I'd probably pass. I felt no emotional bond to any of the characters. It was like some made for SyFi movie on saturday night.The story was interesting but the (very) end was predictable and trite.
2,Hackneyed,"The ""dialogue"" in this novel is so trite in spots you'd think you were watching a bad ""B"" movie. Plot is predictable, and elements forced to fit the commercial appetite. A good high schooler could do as well or better."
4,Wobblie Radicals,Interesting information on the history of a radical union and how it influenced people during the early years of the 20th Century.
3,High School Students Did Not Enjoy This Documentary,"I ordered this dvd for my AP U.S history class, hoping that this would shed more light on the Wobblies because our textbook only had a little snippet about their endeavors. I found the documentary very informative but my senior AP class absolutely hated it. There are several interviews of former Wobblies. In many of the interviews the Wobblies sing songs from their earlier years. My students hated the songs and were bored with the interviews. So if you are odering this for a high school class I would pass."
5,Chocolate lover's fantasy,"After reading other reviews (especially those by caterers) I decided to purchase this chocolate fountain. First time we used it we had 21 High School girls @ the house for a party! Whew! They were pretty much blown away!It was very easy to set up - I followed the directions - and even easier to clean! I elected to do this by hand (even though it says you can do it in the top rack of the dishwasher). It was easy to clean - almost like a ""silverstone"" coating on many of the parts.Once I started melting the chocolate (in the microwave) in batches I poured them into the bottom of the fountain and voila! It flowed for over 2 hours straight, until I turned it off, without a hitch! I would highly recommend this particular machine - worked like a champ - plan to use it for dessert @ our next Bunco!!!"
3,good but...,I bought this fountain about 6 years ago and we used for about 2 o 3 years and then it stopped working...
4,EXCELENTE,"LA FUENTE DE CHOCOLATE FUNCIONA PERFECTAMENTE, LA RECIBI EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES EN VENEZUELA. LO QUE PUEDO RECOMENDAR ES ESCOGER CON CUIDADO EL CHOCOLATE QUE VAYAN A UTILIZAR PORQUE ESE ES EL SECRETO. SALUDOS"
2,A complex novel that fails to catch your interest,"This book is, frankly, a very boring one. While it does tell a key tale in Krynn's history, and the characters are very real, I couldn't help but ask, ""What does it matter this character did that-and-that and the other character did that-and-that?"" The Irda are quite different from the ancient ogres, as other DragonLance books have mentioned. This book explains little of the Irda except the origins, and I doubt that they haven't changed since they first settled. Paste a new title on it - ""The Old Ogres"" - and give us more attention-grabbing plot developments, then I'll give this book a better review."
2,Definitely not the best Dragonlance book.,"Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper.This is one of the most boring Dragonlance books period.Just read the first 2 chapters and the last 2 chapters of the book, and you got the essential storyline of the whole book.It is that pathetic of a book.Hardly anything intresting happens in this book at all.I don't want to read 300 pages of how Ogres enslave humans and elves, and mistreat them through-out the entire book, and the only excitement in the whole book happens at the end, when some good Ogres break away and make their own civilization.This is not essential reading for Dragonlance at all. You can skip this book completely and still not miss any crucial storyline or timeline elements of the whole Dragonlance Saga."
4,Smaller bottle than last 1.5 oz,The scent is great but I was disappointed that this size 1.5 oz was smaller than the last 1.5 oz I received.
2,You get what you pay for...,"I realize this toy is an affordable $10.00 and it does come with cool sound effects albeit WAY TOO LOUD, it is still a nightmare due to the extreme difficulty of changing the batteries. Duracells don't fit right so I had to hunt down some generic alkaline AA's. My 5 yr old son does enjoy the extending arm and the claw but the sound on that thing is deafening even with my high tolerance to noise."
3,Good Starting Point For Further Inquiry,"As a novice to the world of post-modern philosophy, I found this book helpful in starting the inquiry into the terms, ideas, and metaphors used to explain the post-modern point of view. While obviously not an academic rendering, Anderson's style of writing is informative and journalistic. He may not be accurate in all that he reports, but his book has motivated me seek out more information."
3,OK,"As a newf owner I was really looking forward to this book. it was just ok, no real insight to the breed or how they think, just chapters of antidotes."
2,Dog Lover,"I bought this book thinking it would be more on the lines of photos and short stories. Instead it is more like a novel. The book itself is a nice presentation as far as the cover photo and the printing adequate in size. The content I did not care for at all. I found the subject matter a little to weird. For example she uses descriptions like ""having an intimate relationship with her dogs"" and she needing to be more like a dog and her dog wanting to be more human. I found this a bit to much closeness for me. It was out there. I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through it and stopped reading. If I had actually seen this book in person I would not have purchased it for any price let alone for the steep price of $27.95."
2,disappointed,"I got this book based on my Buddhist teacher's advice to do so. I found it hard to follow and unintelligible in spots. However, it could be my own understanding of it also. This kind of book is similar to other esoteric teachings like the Rosicrucian handbook.It really is for advanced readers and thinkers. I suppose that leaves me out. So, if you are into esoteric teachings with a twist, then by all means get this book. However, I warn you that it might seem like gibberish to the uneducated and unenlightened (like myself).Peace...."
5,Truly A great Read,"The translation of the book is more than worth the price. With the commentary and explanation of the terms it exceeds the price paid. The subject matter and the commentary by Jung makes it pricless. I am familiar with many meditation styles and i must say this is a gem. I would recommend that before this work is done one has trained several years in the magical arts, the worker should at least be over thirty and has a family.Also a working knowledge of chi kung or tai chi should be had. Otherwise the treasure gained will not be as grand or the work never begun properly."
4,Beck Arnley fuel pump,"The fuel pump showed up on time, it came with two types of strainers. It is working great. It is an excelent buy. The pump was $30.00 to $60.00 cheaper and the exact same part as the auto parts stores here were going to charge. They also would have a 5 to 10 day wait. The pump did not come with the fuel tank O-ring but that was an overnight $2.99 Auto Zone part quick fix. Thanks."
2,Is there sound in Space?,"If there is, and it sounded like this, Astronauts and NASA would have stopped their pursuit of trying to get there. This album was a big enough waste of a paycheck to want to warn any of you potential victims. Space is the place for this unrest, for the unknown, for all published copies of this cd"
1,Cold Heaven not even lukewarm,"I've never been more disappointed in a book. I actually thought I had missing pages because the ending was practically nonexistent! There were so many missed connections. The potential was there, but, sadly, Mr. Moore obviously lacked the skill to finish what he started. I agree with the reviewer who said it was repetitive. Not being familiar with the works of Graham Greene, I cannot compare him to Brian Moore. There is no mystery or suspense to give away because absolutely nothing happens! Don't waste your time."
4,Out of print?,"All I can assume with the high price and the fact that it isn't available anywhere else is that this soundtrack is out of print. I'm not much of an instrumental film score buff, but this one has always appealed to me. The main theme always reminded me of Birth of the Cool-era Miles Davis. It's the use of a full brass and wind section and the queasiness of the chord changes. Sophisticated, frightening, beautiful. I just wish I could buy the thing."
2,ehh.,"There's nothing truly BAD about this book--the writing is competent, if not remarkable, and there are no glaring logical errors in the plot...but there's nothing really memorable about it, either. Shunlar never stepped outside her role as the stereotypical Amazon warrior, and the rest of the characters are equally flat. Creedath, the villain, is also thoroughly mediocre; sure, the author has him rape and kill a few people to show how bad he is, but it never makes any impact, somehow. We're told that he's this big, threatening, evil guy, but we're not SHOWN it. As for the plot, I'm not even sure if I remember it. The idea about crossbreeding dragons and humans was kind of interesting, but it never seemed to go anywhere. I hate to trash a first time author; I know personally how tough it is to send out that first manuscript and get rejected time and time again. But I don't want to write a less-than-honest review, either. This novel just never came alive for me."
3,Thurber for Children? I Think Not.,"Other reviewers who have written before me have outlined, in clever ways of which Thurber himself would be proud, the story told in this book. While I admire the enthusiasm of other reviewers, I must say that this is the first Thurber book or story that I have found a bit tedious and redundant. Although I think children would love to play with the clever concept of living in a world without the letter o, or indeed any other vowel, I'm not convinced that those under the age of 13 or so would enjoy the book itself. (My entire career has been devoted to working with children and adolescents, and I am particularly interested in children's literature. This doesn't mean I'm right, but I hope it puts my comments in some context.)Young adults would benefit greatly from having the story explained in its historical context, as I agree that Thurber was commenting on the political world climate when he created this slender volume."
5,Sad it's so hard to find much about Matta in print or Web,"It's incredible that it's so hard to find much useful (or visual) information about this great, great Chilean artists, both in print or even on the Web. Born in 1912, and originaly, an architect and former disciple of Le Corbusier, Matta went on to be recognized as a true genius of the Surrealist movement. His works can be seen in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Art Museum of the Americas, Washington D.C.; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio; and Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, of his homeland Chile. Any book you find on him, get it: you will be delighted to discover his work!"
3,The Symbolism of Electricity in Rene Depestre's FESTIVAL....,"A note from Carrol F. Coates (the translator) about THE FESTIVAL OF THE GREASY POLE: in his review Bob Newman stated that there was ""no explanation"" of the acronym NOFES (National Office for the Electrification of Souls). If he had looked at my introduction, he would have found the explanation: a major project of Francois Duvalier was the production of energy (specifically, electric energy) in Haiti: Depestre even uses the slightly altered name of Peligre Dam, constructed under Duvalier--""Veligre"" Dam in the novel. ""Electricity"" becomes the symbol of control and of the project of ""energizing"" the country by Dictator-President Zachary (the fictional caricature of Duvalier). Unlike the reviewer, it seems to me that the symbolism of electricity as a means and a symbol of control by the dictator is fairly transparent in the text of the novel."
5,Cant say enough good things,"Originally looked into Tri O Plex bars after one of their bars won a ""best protein bar"" review featuring over 40 bars...the review said that these bars were packed with protein, tasted good, and didn't carry all the fat and sugar other bars did.I was blown away how good these tasted. Basically they taste like dried peanut butter molded into a bar...they even have real peanuts in them. I have tasted a bunch of fake sugary and powdery bars in the past but these taste like real food. I believe Chef Jay owns a small place in Vegas and these are made there...I have one a day and always look fwd to it....they taste that good!"
5,MEET THE BEATLES,"This book is fabulous! You really feel like you are there, back in the 1960s, part of the magic that was Beatlemania!This is a different book than the original! first quality and great new pictures!"
5,I was a sceptic but......,"I was a sceptic but had nothing else to lose after 8 years of on and off re-occuring back pain. Had every therapy known to man apart from surgery ( was advised to but was not keen) so thought why not give this book a go. It took me about 4 months of reading, re-reading and convincing myself but....... the pain suddenly just disappeared and I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now. When I get a twinge, which is maybe twice a year, I just think about the cause and it disappears. May not work for everyone but hell of a lot cheaper than all those chiro , stretching, acupuncture sessions!"
5,"When everything else failed, try this","Here's life-long athlete who loves to run around, 5.0 tennis player, skier, decades of soccer, running, 2004 Boston Marathon, never dealt with major injuries or pain, other than tight hammies. Then it started. Over a year of blinding knee pain (tendinitis, so they said), a year of debilitating backpain. Doctor visits, treatment plans, exercise plans, more opinions, PT, chiro, cortisone, deep tissue massage, no more tennis, no more running, ""no more bending over to tie your shoe"" .. per one of the Pats doctors, who then suggested a disk replacement at age 40-something. The next day I saw Dr Martinez at NEBH who concluded a ""benign"" condition and suggested this reading. After only a few pages, I felt like another prototypical case study straight out of the book.A month later, I was pain-free. That was 2 years ago. Words can not describe the gratitude for Dr Sarno and Dr Martinez."
1,Don't waste your money.,A waste of time and money. The author attributes most pain to a psychological basis.
2,Medical vs. non-medical controversy,"An interesting discussion of differing approaches by the medical and non-medical communities. The techniques espoused by Mr. Sarno didn't help my back pain, though."
5,Think it may not be you?,"Everyone carries their stress different. Some manifest it in their shoulders, and seek out a massage for comfort. Some feel it in their neck. Many of us feel it in our back. For the latter of us, this book is a real help. It is hard, in this rush-rush world of ours, to slow down and actually be aware of.. our selves! We dedicate our time to work, family, friends, and for most of us, WE COME LAST! It's why we are the fattest people on the planet with the most stress related illnesses. Dr. Sarno hit it right on the head -- a lot of back pain has nothing to do with deformed spines or degenerating disks. In fact, few people have a ""perfect"" back. Most of us have issues. But only some of us have pain. Why? Some physical, a lot mental. Read this, try it -- it works!"
3,Part 1 of what must be yet to come on this subject.,"A very interesting commenatary on the mind-body connection of illnesses and common conditions. Ok, so I'm convinced. But, now how do we deal with our new insight? What do we do about the conditions that we are now convinced can't be treated by conventional treatments? Other than making a trip to New York to visit this Dr., one is left with very little insight as to how to proceed to treat these conditions. Too much time spent convincing the reader of the mind-body connection and too little time spent on the ""cure."""
5,Sarno's amazing book,"This book is amazing. I have been suffering from stomach problems, specifically a spastic colon, for years. From reading this book I became aware of how much I have been repressing for the past 30 years (and I've had a wonderful life.) I also became aware that all the fear that I have felt has just been a coping mechanism to distract me from facing what I really felt. I read the book 1 month ago, have had numerous revelations about my life and am about 90% pain free. Unbelievable."
1,Try other treatments,"I believed the concepts in this book for sometime but it did not help me in long term. I would recommend trying other alternative treatments such as ""Pain Free"" by Pete Egoscue."
3,Disappointing,"Although it was insightful, it was disappointing as the author does not provide strategies for being healed. You come away with an understanding- which is convincing-that your back pain is due to emotional pain without any guidance to use this information to overcome back pain."
3,Better than nothing,"I bought this product because the damper on our fireplace is broken and its so old we were told it would be hard to get parts for it. I wanted something to block the humid summer air, bugs, etc from coming down the chimney during the warm months.The instructions say to put it at the bottom but the inflation tube and valve are not long enough to put it up past the damper and still be able to operate the valve. So, I ended up going up on the roof and placing it as far down as I could reach. On humid days I still feel some hot air coming in although not as much as before. And, at least it provides a barrier against insects.Bottom line, its better than having an open flue all summer long."
2,"Steven R. Covey, ""The 8th Habit""","The product description states that a DVD comes with this book "" The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1996), the author demonstrates in words and a series of 16 brief DVD clips (included) exactly how to find your own voice and, for leaders, how to support the discovery of the organization's voice."" However no such DVD was included. I ordered the book based on a personal recommendation specifically pertaining to the DVD. I am very disappointed and will consider returning this order due to the omission."
2,The 8th Attempt at More Book Royalties?,"Between the cute circles and multiple diagrams is a kernel of truth: Stephen Covey saw that Rick Warren had touched a nerve with his Purpose-Driven Life, and he wanted a piece of the action. No longer is it good enough to be effective; you have to be ""Find Your Voice and Help Others Do the Same."" Picture Rick Warren without God, and that's what you get. The ""new Habit"" could have served as a new introduction to 7 Habits or an added feature to a new edition of the book. But alas, you don't make money that way, and after all, in the business world, that is the true meaning of ""effective."""
5,Surprised by the punch Covey still has,"I expected to be underwhelmed by this volume. ""More of the Covey machine,"" I thought. I was wrong. This book can reach a part of you that's beyond what you can get to by applying the first 7 habits. ""Life changing"" is an understatement."
2,Habit-forming,"Covey's one-man publishing industry stresses the application of common sense to your pathetic, meaningless life, most importantly in the service of the company/corporation/entity/thing you work for.The 'substance' of this book can be condensed in a magazine article, or a good web article, but that would negate the reason to publish yet another book chock full 'o stories about personal success, vision, leadership, success, enhancement, empowerment, blah, blah, blah, vision, moral integrity, data integrity, success, effectiveness, and other important things.Covey is a thinking man, hence the tweaked model with the 'discovery' of the 8th habit. No doubt a 9th, and 10th habit do exist. Perhaps penning another rehash of previously published material? A true success story."
3,habits for organizations,You must read the 7 habits of highly effective people first. This is more toward organizations. I was kind of disappointed. I was expecting someone else like an improvement. This just proves the 7 habits are sound principles.
5,Buy it,"If you loved the BBA album in the studio. This one is for you ! I put 5 stars for the studio album, I should put 6 stars for this one ! One of my best rock album !! Even if it is quite expensive, you won't be disappointed, trust me ! Jeff plays really great solos on stage and you will hear him play with his talkbox... Bogert Appice really do a fabulous job here... So, buy it !"
3,Tim Bogart needed to keep his mouth shut!!!,"Everyone plays great - Jeff is still my favorite guitar player,but after you hear this once (I had the vinyl back in 74) that one listening will be enough. Just as you get into each song, besides the low grade vox by Bogart - you get his sophomoric and annoying high pitched yelps and screaming in the middle of Jeff's brillant solos. TB is a total buzz kill - as his carreer following this project shows (nada). Great bass player - but he needed to keep his mouth shut. Thinking of how even more impressive this configuration would have been with a real vocalist."
4,A great fit for our Sharp Aquos,"Purchased this to mount our 15"" LCD on the wall. The bracket is great but we had dfficulty with the mounting hardware...needed to get different wall anchors to accommodate our old apt. walls. Once up, the bracket adjusts in several directions...even extends out about 18"" and swivels. Check your walls before attempting to mount."
2,Disappointing for the Price,The price was too high for what was given in my opinion. I felt like I got a $4.95 scholastic book for my child. Refers to products not readly available in the US. Very disappointed.
2,More hype than substance.,"Yes, this has nudity, but it is dull and a poor attempt to capture the Benny Hill flavor of comedy. You can watch this, but I think it is boring and tries too hard."
5,Great book about a strong woman,I found this book as a child in the Pratt Institute Library and am hoping that someone will republish it soon; I would like to introduce my daughters to it. A great book about a strong woman who stands up for what she believes.
4,an interesting book but...,"I read most of Noel Streatfeild's children's books that were readily available in the mid 80's and have just recently discovered her excellent adult novels, especially Grass in Picadilly and Sapling as well as her three autobiographical book-- but there is something about this book that always bothered me when I was younger and still strikes me now. I'm not sure how the father is meant to be presented but he seems like such a distant and demanding person that I just felt bad for the children. What kind of father punishes a child for selling the family's umbrellas (to raise money to afford tennis equipment no less) but not giving her birthday or Christmas presents for two years-- but instead gives her four umbrellas over two years. I certainly sympathized with the children and the pressure they were under to be great at something but whether or not it was intentional, this book takes it further than the other ""shoe"" books."
1,Gung Hokey!,"Very sappy, manipulative management book that starts out with a death scene to soften you up, then takes you on a short trip from a plant facing closure to winning a national award in about 150 5""x8"" pages about 1/2 full of 24 point type. Very lightweight. Your suspension of disbelief will last about 5 pages, unless you have been put under its corny spell like many reviewers seem to have been. If there is an ""Andy"" or ""Peggy"" I'll eat my hat. Here's a sample: ""I love you, Andy"" I choked out. ""I know,"" he said. Then added, ""I love you too. Always have.""Here's some more: ""Oh, no, Andy. No,"" I protested. ""It is you who have blessed me and everyone in the company.""Here's one more: ""Peggy, I'm your father!"" ""Oh, Andy! I knew it! I loooove you!""Oh wait, they didn't go quite that far. But damn close.Save yourself from two hours of this soap opera and read ""The Goal"" instead."
2,Silly,"Very stupid book. It has concepts that are good if judged by their own merit, but they are presented in a very juvenile way."
3,Good Story (If you can last long enough to finish),"This book tells the story of a woman, Chelsea Kane, who, after the death of her adoptive mother, decides to ""discover"" herself by looking up her biological parents. She moves to Norwich Notch (her birth place) to start her search. The book is slow and other than Chelsea, the character development lacks some. But after finishing the book, I decided the slow moving pace of the book represented the slow pace of life in Norwich Notch. Ms. Delinsky starts the book out with a family squabble over a divided set of jewelry, which leads the reader to believe this is one of the conflicts Chelsea has to resolve throughout the book. While the other conflicts resolve in a satisfying way, this story line has no closure."
1,Buyer Beware,"This product was a huge disappointment. Although sang by the original artists, these songs are NOT the original versions. If you're looking for the classics you love and/or grew up with, look elsewhere."
3,Mixed bag,My daughter loves the game but can't finish the final maze. Either there is a bug in the program or she missed something and now can't go back.
4,A bit partial,My dad played Adam. I've been looking for this and enjoyed seeing it again after many years. This was a dark and interesting story.
2,"Good message, bad movie","The movie is based on the true story of a group of Christian missionaries who were killed by an indigenous tribe in the Ecuador's jungle.The message of the movie is amazing: the victims' wives decided to stay in Ecuador and continue to share the Gospel of Christ with the tribe.It is impressive that the son of one of the victims, Steve, forgave the murderer of his father!However, it is unacceptable that in a movie about Christian missionaries, the word Jesus is never mentioned, perhaps in the name of today's political correctness."
4,Absolutely wonderful movie!,"I have rarely seen a more moving story than the one told in The End of the Spear. The acting was superbly done. It gets across not only what the main characters did, but quite a bit of what they were thinking, as well. Much is told through facial expressions and body language, and this is quite well done.My only beef with it and the reason for four stars instead of five is that I thought some of the narration was lacking. Occasionally, it was hard to follow the story, exactly. It helped that I was familiar with the story through Elisabeth Elliot's writings. Some of these things may not be caught by the uninitiated!It is still worth seeing. I am rarely moved by something I see on screen as much as I was by this movie. I recommend it to anyone other than young children. Because of its level of violence, it may not be appropriate for young children, but it is a story that needed to be told."
5,The cost of discipleship,"Here's a well done, true story of the cost missionaries paid to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. I have since went on another web link to find out where the wife of one of the victims, Elizabeth Elliott, is and I have been able to benefit by her pamphlets on grieving the lost of a love one.I recommend this movie to those who have a passion for sharing God's Word. It's a real motivator. To God be the Glory!"
2,Marilyn,If you are a Marilyn Monroe fan-which I am-it MAY be worth it to read this novel.It is abit stupid and the author should be named Joyce Carol Pottymouth...is there a more disgusting woman than this writer?
1,Yikes!,I could barely skim the first ten pages there was so much DRAMA and so many EXCALAMATION POINTS! When I read that JCO used Summers book on Monroe I knew that her product could not be quality.
3,More than Marilyn,"Having read ""Black Girl/White Girl"", I wanted to explore more of Oates' writing. ""Blonde"" is a 700+ page novel based on Marilyn Monroe's life. However, the novel also appears to be an indictment of the creepy movie moguls who run Hollywood studios and ruin young starlets' lives to prove their manhood (or inhumanhood) while attempting to fulfill their every sexual fantasy. Makes me never want to patronize a product that comes out of Hollywood again. Oates has the ability to make her main characters haunt the reader. If you want a long read that explores the Hollywood milieu, leaves you emotionally drained, and gets into the head of MM, an abused child and an abused woman, read this."
3,Disgust & Fascination,"I thought less of Oates for writing this book, speaking ill of the dead. I thpought less of Monroe for learning of her dark side. I thought less of myself for continuing to read it. I was too fascinated to put it down. Sad!"
1,Headache inducing,"I am well aware of Ms. Oates outstanding reputation as a writer, but I found ""Blonde"" to be incredibly difficult to read, let alone enjoy. Her writing style in this book is irritating. Don't read ""Blonde"" if you have a mild headache, because after you've read 30 pages or so, you'll have a major migraine. I don't know, maybe you have to be an intellectual to enjoy this style of prose. If that's the case, then I'm definitely NOT an intellectual."
2,What's the truth?,"I bought this book because I read that this was supposed to be the truth about Marilyn Monroe's life. It showed her addiction to sex and sedatives. But you have to wonder, what's the truth and what's not? How can the author of this book know how Marilyn felt in the different situations? If Marilyn was alive, and could retell her story, then it would be great. But this is based on facts about her life, and the rest seems like guesswork. That doesn't give you more knowledge of her life. I know it is a novel, and not a biography. But when you her that this is the story about her behind the glamour, you expect a lot. And I wasn't impressed by the result. Some chapters are better than others. But once the author repeats herself over and over again in what is supposed to be a poem written by Norma Jean, it is awful. I would not recommend this book for anyone. It doesn't live up to it's high expectations, and you don't get any closer to the truth. Buy another book!"
3,Half Truth or Half Fiction?,"The author warns at the front of the book that ""Blonde"" is ""fiction"", and NOT a biography of Marilyn Monroe. But it's hard to tell where the truth ends & the author's imagination begins. Although it's an engrossing read, the author's imagination takes literary license with Monroe's private life, her friends & her spouses. If some of the real people portrayed in the book were still alive, they'd probably sue for libel -- and win. Ms. Oates feels free to speak ill of the dead."
4,Study of Norma Jean's Life and the Craft of Writing,"I chose to read this book because I admire the work of Joyce Carol Oates and I wanted to see how she addressed such a challenging task: writing a fictionalized biography.She succeeded wonderfully!The only criticism is it went on for a couple hundred more pages than perhaps were necessary - or perhaps it would be better said that the last couple hundred pages were less interesting to me... so perhaps a different edit would change my perceptions although it makes sense that Norma Jean's descent into despair would not be as entertaining writing.Nonetheless, I read this entire book in less than a week while running my business, teaching and doing my usual non fiction reading which is quite a testimony to the ""page turning"" nature of Oates' writing.Definitely worthy of a read and a study of the craft."
5,an incredible experience,"Already a fan of Joyce Carol Oates, when I finished _Blonde_ I almost immediately became a fan of Marilyn Monroe as well. Yes, it is a very long, somewhat foggy fictionalized account of Marilyn's life, but having now read several different biograhpies I see how close to the truth Oates really came. Changing many names (foster parents and producers, for example) and referring to Marilyn's husbands as ""The Ex-Athlete"" and ""The Playwright"", Oates nevertheless fills the book with all the people who surrounded Marilyn, and reveals the roles they played in both her desperate need to be loved and her blind ambition to become famous. The best part about this novel is Oates' ability to BECOME Norma Jeane, to get inside of her head and write in the actress' voice in an extremely believable way (hence the sometimes confusing and ""foggy"" aspect of the narration). _Blonde_ is a very haunting and beautiful work that will always be with me."
2,very disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book... but I wish I had read some of the reviews here first. I am glad to see I am not alone in finding BLONDE just terrible! I have bogged my way halfway through and can't even finish it, it is that bad. The intent is transparent, and fails miserably."
4,Volume I of Shirer's 4 Volume Memoirs (including the volume on Gandhi),"So begins volume 1 of Shirer's 4 volume memoirs. As the title indicates, this volume covers 1904-1930. Shirer talks about his growing up in the midwest, his college year at Coe College in Iowa, and his subsequent experience in Europe. There is considerable interesting material about extensive ex-pat literary community in Paris. Also, there is a nice segment on Shirer's coverage of Lindbergh's landing in Paris.As discussed in the third official installment of the memoirs (Native's Return), Shirer wanted the Volume II to focus on his encounters with Gandhi, but Simon and Schuster turned down the idea and the second installment. So Shirer ended up going with Little, Brown. And the Gandhi volume (which I would consider either volume 1.5 or 4) was later published as a separate volume."
2,overrated,"Mark Doty's poems are seriously overrated. They are overwritten, full of what reads as faked-up emotion, limited in range--both of subject and imagery. Can't think of anything to say? Just pile on more language."
5,"Best capo, best price","I am a pro musician and play alot of songs capod up on the guitar. There is no better capo than the G7th especially if your actively using it and performing alot. It tends to be pricier than the other options but well worth it to me, and Amazon has the best price..."
5,Best capo on the market,"I have currently own This capo for about five years, and I can say that it is the best capo on the market.It only takes one hand to apply and works effectively. You can also use just one hand to move it. Definitely would be a recommended capo to own"
3,I expected more for the price.,"The capo is a wonderful tool for the guitar. When new innovations are made, they are generally priced higher than their older counterparts. The ability to exert the desired amount of pressure that you want from a capo was very intriguing to me. For chording and the ability to move the capo quickly, I give it high marks. If you bend a note and you don't have the capo tightened down enough, the string will stay bent. That is a definite minus. I think it's a great invention. I just think it costs way too much. There are other capos that do essentially the same thing now for 1/3rd the price. Try some less expensive one's. You'll save a lot of money."
5,NO REGRETS!!!,"I bought this being a little wary of paying $40 for a capo, but I figured that if I'm going to be paying $15 every year or two for a new capo, I might as well pay more for just 1 that will last. In a nutshell, I'm very happy with it: easy to use, goes right on, and no retuning necessary. After this, I have NO REGRETS about paying $40 for it. It's money WELL-WORTH it. HIGHLY recommended."
4,One of the best capo's I've tried,"This capo is easy on, easy off and puts even string pressure throughout. I would have given it 5 stars, but it has some difficulty with the low e string when used above the 7th fret on any of my guitars."
5,Love it,"This is a wonderful capo. It is easy to use and looks great. More importantly, it does not squeeze the strings out of tune."
5,G7th Performance Capo,"I READ THE REVIEWS AND TALKED WITH A STORE SALESMAN BUT HAD TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF.IT`S DIFFERENT PUTTING IT ON AND TAKING IT OFF THAN A TRIGGER TYPE,BUT NOT ANYTHING BAD IF YOU CAN ADAPT TO CHANGE.THE TENSION IS ADJUSTABLE AND I USE IT ON A SIX STRING ELECTRIC AND IT WORKS ON THE TWELVE STRING PERFECTLY.DON`T HAVE AN ACOUSIC RIGHT NOW BUT THERE`S NO DOUBT IT WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL.TO ME IT`S NOT HEAVY AT ALL.WAS USING A DUNLOP BUT WAS ON MY SECOND ONE BECAUSE BOTH OF THE SPRINGS BROKE - WHICH IS WHY I NEEDED ANOTHER BRAND.THE ONLY QUESTION NOW IS HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.SEEMS WELL BUILT AND I`D RECCOMEND IT IF YOU CARE TO SPEND THAT MUCH FOR A CAPO.IT`S DIFFERENT,IT`S ADJUSTABLE,IT LOOKS NICE,AND IT WORKS AS A CAPO IS SUPPOSED TO. PLAY ON AND ENJOY YOURSELF."
3,Prefer Kyser,"I had heard this was an amazing capo, but after trying it, I will stick to my Kyser capos. I found that I couldn't remove and replace the G7th as quickly on the frets (as I change frets often), and I had some buzzing."
5,Disappointingly wonderful,"Great book for reading! No strait practical recommendations, but still absolutely helpful. Moody & groovy."
3,It Was Alright-,"This movie reminded me of Pulp Ficition, especially the part when Lucky is captured by Cybil Shepards' character and nearly tortured. My boyfriend enjoyed this movie and I think it's because Lucky held a Puerto Rican stripper hostage throughout the entire movie. Go figure."
2,not one of her best,The hero gray wolf is too controling and selfish and the heroine danette is selfish also. sometimes i just wanted to strangle them both. I have read better cassie edwards books and this one is definatly not one of them. When i start a book i always finish it and it took me so long to finish it cuz i would get sick of what was going on. one thing after the other and lots of complaining from both of them. Drama in the 19th century. It was like reading a soap opera. everything that could possibly happen did. i say skip it
1,Forget it,"I just could not get into this book, it could not keep me interested I tried to read 1-14 and I could not even tell you what I even read it just kept jumping around each chapter and could not keep you interested in it at all."
2,"A good try, but short on several features","The sound quality is incredible - second to none!Why only two stars? First, it isn't compatible with the iPhone 3G. (I don't know about the original iPhone because I don't own one.) Not only isn't there an adapter for the dock connector, but the device doesn't fit in the recessed resting area.Second, the integration with my iPod mini is poorly conceived. The device is smart enough to tell when music isn't playing after a while and turn the power off, but:- it doesn't automatically turn on when you turn on your iPod- it doesn't turn off or even pause your iPod when you power it downThese are basic and integral functions that are inexcusable to neglect. I'm returning mine for a less expensive Bose."
2,So unlike Nora Roberts,"I was so dissapointed in this book. The first book ""Night Shift"" was very good. The second half ""Night Shadow"" was ridiculous. A woman who falls in love with a man who transitions from a normal man to an invisible man, is just so....stupid. To say I was disspointed doesn't begin to sum it up. I couldn't even finish the book."
3,Night Shadow,"I have all the books in the ""Death"" series and they are great. I also have many of Nora Roberts other books which are also very good. Night Shift was an easy, entertaining read. However, I did not especially care for Night Shadow. It seemed as though the characters were ""borrowed"" from the JD Robb, In Death, books. There is Gage who is very wealthy and handsome as is Roarke. Gage owns a ton of high end real estate as does Roarke. Gage has the ability to hack into systems (IRS, etc.) illegally, as does Roarke. Gage's ""Majordomo"" is Patrick and Roarke's is Summerset."
2,Limited information,Many nice position photos but very limited in any information. If you are looking for a book that has useful information than this may not be the one. Not worth the money.
1,Very Disappointed,"First let me say that Thea Devine is one of my favorite authors and I have gotten some delicious ideas/inspirations from her hot..hot..characters and storylines...but this book was just confusing, slow, and disappointing. I never finished the book and it currently sits on my bookshelf gathering dust.Ms. Devine, I will not give up on you or future books to come and everyone gets a free pass once in a while but please do your fans a favor by embracing what works for you:hot Russian Counts, strong-willed independent women, cold foreign lands or hot desert backdrops, wicked/cheating antagonists who just don't understand our heroines and finally that yummy alpha male who knows how to keep your readers satisfied all night long(smile)!"
5,This is a great buy!,I am addicted to e-mail! I admit it! So when I go out of town or if I am on the go...I NEED TO CHECK MY E-MAIL! This card was easy to install and all I had to do was follow the simple step by step on screen instructions. I also downloaded software from my provider that was immediately installed during my next hot sync. I don't browse the internet on this...haven't tried either. But I have used it to gain access to email and instant messaging. I highly recommend this if you are like me..and have to stay connected.
2,This is an extended version of the original book,"I loved the ideas contained in ""The Automatic Millionaire"". However, I felt that this book was portrayed as more of a ""companion"" publication to the book. It isn't. It is essentially the book but bigger and with pages to fill in. If you bought the book, you already have this. Just use a notebook to write your stuff down. If you haven't bought the book, and would like a place to make notes and calculations related to the book's theories, then buy this one instead, and have both in one."
5,"From John Ardoin's review in ""The Furtwaengler Record""","This live 1953 performance is the most compelling in unity of conception & in execution of all Furtwaengler's recreations of this score. Even with reservations about individual cast members, this remains the finest of Furtwaengler's 'Fidelios'--an achievement of heaven-storming power.Furtwaengler sometimes allows the end of a section of dialogue to bleed into the ensuing musical number for a heightened sense of melodrama. But most important of all is his emphasis on the score's harmonic movement. The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is finished & responsive, spurred on by the white heat of the conductor's inspiration. Windgassens's singing is impressive & secure. Martha Moedl as Leonore is incisive but erratic; nonetheless Moedl makes the drama of Leonore's predicament & heroism blaze. Sena Jurinac, soon to be a Leonore herself, is substantial; Edelmann is a solid Pizarro."
5,Comprehensive in Its Breadth,"As others have noted, there are many books on negotiations. What makes this book stand out is the comprehensive breadth of its coverage and that it provides an integrated view on the subject. To my knowledge, it is unique in its coverage of both the ""hard"" and ""soft"" aspects of negotiations.For that reason, I recommend this book to everyone interested in negotiations. Using it as a foundation, you can then read other books to explore more deeply specific aspects of this subject.If your budget allows, I also recommendEssentials of Negotiationas a complement to this book.Once you've read one or both of those, you'll be ready forNegotiation Analysis: The Science and Art of Collaborative Decision Makingby Howard Raiffa."
4,Good (supplementary) book on Negotiation,"The book is very well structured and extremely readable with real case problems. It starts off with the big picture of negotiation, leads to specific points, and includes toward the end a lot of ""people skills"" (likes social dilemmas or different cultures). The book is neately structured with a great conclusion at every chapter. Quantitative support is used only where necessary and therefore kept to a minimum. I recommended as a supplementary book to Getting to Yes (still my all time favourite) or The Art and Science of Negotiation (for the very serious student)."
5,Sheer psychedelic intensity,"The studio albums are a interesting but tame. THIS, however, will blow your doors off. Thundering organ, wailing vocals, cataclysmic drums... In my opinion this beats Big Brother and Jefferson Airplane."
3,"TRAVELLER, B.C","This album was a suprise to me when i first purchased it. Billy has used different approaches to the overall sound of the c.d in this one. Singing can be heard on a couple of tracks which is odd for a solo album of his, however it is good and he plays expertly at both carrying the songs and adding his unique blend of exciting fills.mostly slower tracks, no 200bpm beats here!Apart from the continual change in style throught the c.d billys drums remain superb, and are recorded well."
4,Creative Nonfiction Review,"This book is being used as a text for the online Creative Nonfiction course I am taking through National University. It is a good book and I really appreciate the notes made by Patsy Simms, the editor, at the bottom of each page. They are helping me to write my reading responses for the class."
2,When Hippies Make Movies,"I had looked forward to seeing this movie for quite a while, being a big Sellers fan and a Ringo/Beatles fan - as well had heard through the grapevine that this was supposed to be a fun and interesting movie. It is neither. Perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself. The idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both Sellers and Starr to shine, but the script and story (what there was of it) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to. One strange setting after another ends anti-climatically, which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity. It really does seem that they ""wrote"" it as they went along, if there was anything written at all. And one tired anti-establishmment cliche after another gives good example why professionals instead of hippies should run with the good ideas in order to see them well executed."
3,Twisted late sixties British humor,"While not a great or even a good movie within itself, ""Magic Christian"" is a great late sixties period piece that stretches the dark humor of the excesses of greed. The somewhat Monty Python-like humor makes the movie lightly entertaining at times. The cameo appearances give the film greater interest and a sense of history, although twisted to say the least. The soundtrack is probably the most intriguing part of ""Magic Christian"" with input from Paul McCartney through the band Badfinger and a nice contribution from Thunderclap Newman."
1,Pointless,"This film is pointless, pornographic, and also boring. It is surprising that such an elegant and accomplished actress as Binoche would allow herself to be viewed so unflatteringly. What a waste of her talents!"
5,"That infectious, INSANE laugh!","If you want to hear a great, unbridled laugh...get this movie. It is literally one of the funniest movies. Tom Hanks nails the concept of comedic timing. He is so great at expressing annoyance, delerium, anger, jealousy, skeptiscm, and pride.This movie follows Tom Hanks and girlfriend (Shelly Long) through their tumultuous ordeal of renovating a ""lemon"" of a seemingly beautiful mansion. There is a classic scene where the tub falls through the ceiling onto the 1st floor and that is where the hysteria really starts. But my favorite scene is when Tom Hanks gets stuck in the floor and starts talking about care bears and farm animals. Classic!Anyhow, you will not go wrong in getting this movie, it is a kick in the pants!"
4,HILARIOUS!!,"I CAN'T HELP BUT BE IN TOTAL HYSTERICS WHEN I WATCH THIS CLASSIS COMEDY!! FEATURING SHELLEY LONG AND TOM HANKS, THIS IS COMEDY AT IT'S BEST!!"
3,Gave to daughter - in - law in celebration of homeownership,great film for Katrina victims enough said or understood and unsaid Cheshire cat smiled to oblivion politics is the haven of stupid attorneys why can't they keep only one job
5,CLASSIC COMEDY.,"Classic Comedy!Any One Who Knows His Comedy,Knows This Film.Watch For The Collapsing Chimney.5 Stars."
1,80's humor is so bad!,My husband and I are doing a complete renovation so someone recommend we see this movie. I was expecting it to be really funny but instead it just reminded me of one of the aweful 80's movie! Not funny and not a classic in my book.
2,"Cheap nut splitter, not for automotive use!","This nut splitter will work well on very inexpensive low grade nuts, this is not, and I repeat NOT for use on automotive grade nuts. First nut worked like a champ, but on second nut tool broke, and is now garbage."
3,Dense,The information is too densely packed into this paperback. I had to use it for a Mid East politics class but had a hard time memorizing most of it.Other than that it is a good book for someone who wants to get the gist of the history from 1920s till the 1990s.
4,Enjoyable jazz trio by late great John Hicks,"There is one misinformed 2 star review of this CD calling it ""non jazz."" Come on-this CD defines jazz trio at it's best. The three have an almost symbiotic swinging relationhship. Walter Booker and Idris give tight support to John's piano. They play mostly original compositions on this CD. They play even better on CD's recorded 3 years later. See my reviews of ""Inc. 1"" and ""In Concert."" Of course, these CDs are only the beginning of the John Hicks story. He recorded frequently as a leader and sideman until his death in 2006. I consider him one of the greatest jazz pianists. Listen to him, and he will never disappoint."
5,Enjoyable account of a vietnam special forces operation,"Capt. Krasnoff was the team leader of 5 Australian SAS attached to a U.S. Special Forces unit for project Rapid Fire (B-36). If you enjoy true first-hand accounts of SF operations then this is for you. I had some reservations about buying this book because of another 'anonymous' reviewer who somewhat bitterly alleged that it was a work of fiction. I contacted via email the commander of this particular operation, Col. Bo Gritz. He stated in no uncertain terms that Capt. Krasnoff did indeed serve under him during the operation and that the account was true in every word. He further added that anyone who says different - wasn't there. Since the negative reviewer declined to identify himself it is his own credibility (at best) that is obviously lacking. I enjoyed the book thoroughly!"
4,Quality product makes good use of blind corner,"I purchased theKV Rotary Recycling Center With Out Door Hardware Whiteabout two months ago. I'm very happy with it. This unit makes great use of a difficult space to utilize in the kitchen - a blind corner cabinet. It is extremely convenient to have a 3-bin recycling center in the kitchen. It has saved me countless trips to my outdoor recycling bin.Overall the unit has proved to be very sturdy and holds as much weight as you could possibly put into it. The bins are easy to take in and out for emptying.My only minor complaint is that it did not explain how to shorten up the post (cut it) to fit your cabinet properly. With a little simple measuring though, I figured it out. Just make sure that you don't cut too much off! Measure twice, cut once."
5,Great way to use space in place of broken lazy Susan,"When we bought our house one of the lazy Susan's door was broken. Hubby tried to fix it, but it couldn't be fixed without remodeling the kitchen.So, I found this product while looking for a simple recycling bin. It's a bit pricey. However, it's worth every penny we spent. My hubby had no problem installing the product on the existing lazy Susan pole.I find that with the recycling center right by the kitchen sink we are recycling much more than we used to when the recycling bucket was in a utility closet.We use one bin for glass/metals, one for paper/cardboard, and one for plastics.We are very pleased with this purchase."
3,"Nice and quiet, video quality ok","A totally quiet graphics card (instead of the usual Hoover types)with a reasonably ok display. It seems hardware manufactures are hyper focused on speed and neglecting precise image quality, as required by someonelike me who watches bar charts all day long.I still have 4mb pci video cards while slow, produce a clearer image than anything I could find in current production..a sad state of affairs...Overall the best one I could find after trying 5 others."
1,chris,"i was let down, just a few songs i liked, guess i think of the guess who, and i should have not."
4,Excellent read,Very good read. I enjoyed that it covered the family well . I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend it.
4,A Haunting Tale,Excellent read which draws you into the troubled life of the main character and how it affects the loved ones around her.
4,Literary Romance,"It's been years since I've picked up a Joyce Carol Oats novel,and I don't know why, because she is such a fantastic writer. Longing, regret & tragedy are the trade marks of her novels and this is no exception. A young bride the morning after her marriage discovers her husband has thrown himself into Niagra Falls. What follows is an offbeat but sweet love story that becomes a somewhat traditional melodramatic multi-generational story. However Oats transcends the genre with sharp astute writing that cuts to the core of emotion."
2,Way too long,"I ""read"" this book in audio form, and it was just way too long. Not really exciting, nor gripping. That said, I did finish it, hoping for a astonishing closing.--It didn't happen. It follows a woman and her family from her pre-marriage days, into her early 60's. The main character gets stranger and stranger, yet her children still have unfailing love for her. Which is admirable. But it isn't a novel you finish and say, ""Wow. That was great"" and pass along to someone else. Don't waste your time."
2,Epic trash can!,"'The Falls', to me, was just a bunch of depressed citizens that didn't know what to do with themselves besides cheatign on their spouses and jump over the Niagra Falls. It is really 496 pages of junk, pulp fiction, nothing more."
1,A Disappointment,Too many words where they weren't needed and not enough when the book had some plot. Characters were hard to connect to and like.Very unbelievable main character. I am from the Falls and didn't even like the references to the area that also were not written well. Very disappointing. Very ard to finish reading this book.
3,Why Ike decided not to capture Berlin in 1945.,"This is a short book about why Ike did not use the opportunity to capture Berlin in 1945. This is an earlier book before Ambrose became widely known, and to be honest more scholorly and less reader friendly. It is a short read.Ike did not sanction the capture of Berlin for a number of reasons. First, Berlin was in the Soviet sphere in Germany, and second because his troops were not in as good a position as the Russians of taking the Nazi capital. The cost in human lives would also be great, especially if the city would have to be handed back to the Russians. For these reasons, Ike decided that Berlin was not worth the risk, and sent his forces toward Leipzig. Ike made a sound military decision."
5,An Eye-Opener,This book gives you the perspective of a combatant rather than a historian or journalist. A gripping account of real events that left me thankful I wasn't there and appreciative of those who were.
5,Great buy,This is a great buy. You get a hundred tootsie roll pops of various flavors. Locally I couldn't beat the price nor could I find the quantity in one package.
1,Nature sounds disappear!,"I purchased this prior to surgery thinking it would be great for recovery. However, the ""nature sounds"" only worked the first time I turned it on. After that, despite changing batteries, etc., the sounds never came back again. I wouldn't recommend this purchase."
5,"The best ""Christmas Carol""","This 50 year old Christmas Carol is still the best one. The ghost of Scrooge's dead partner is terrifying. The special effects are amazing considering how old they are. The acting is wonderful, not over or under played. The story is truly captured in this film."
5,A Christmas Carol DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition,"No problems. Prompt delivery. Product in good condition. Black and white amazingly clear, a beautiful picture, better even than the colorized version. It's nice to have both."
4,Better than the last one.,"This film has been released I don't know how many times now. But I'm pretty sure this is the 2nd Blu-Ray version. I think they did a good job with the video transfer portion. But I still can't believe that they can't fix the atrocious ""echo audio"" that plagues much of this movie! And even though I know this makes the purists cringe. Please put the colourised version back on!!!! For those who hate it so much. It's not like you have to watch it. Just pretend it's not there and let those us who like it enjoy it."
5,The Only Scrooge,Alistair Sim is the only true Scrooge. And this movie cannot be beat by any other renditions. This movie is the most chillingly effective version. This restored version makes the entertainment that much better. So do be a Scrooge. Buy this movie and you won't be visited by ghosts of your wrong doings.
3,OK,The DVD worked fine.....package was destroyed and pieces were missing while the packaging was not open. Not sure what happened?
5,memories,"I love this movies as I truly think this is the best ""A Christmas Carol"" filmed! It brings back memories of my childhood."
3,Christmas classic,"A fine film and a nice restoration, although even considering the era, the special effects were a bit cheesy. The Ghost of Christmas Past is just a guy with a black sheet over his head. Surely they could have done better with that costume. You could even see right through the sheet at one point. As for the package, I started watching the 16:9 version but, as I guessed, it was a zoomed version of the original 4:3 ratio, so tops of heads were constantly cut off. It drove me crazy and I ended up switching to the 4:3 version."
5,The all time and irreplaceable classic,"Every Christmas I take time to read ""A Christmas Carol""; and also watch the movie. Lately, it's been difficult to find this version on TV. You can find the George C. Scott version which is excellent and a Disney version too, but they are not the 1951 version with Alistair Sim. Look out for Marley's scream! See if you can spot the cameraman in the mirror. Enjoy Scrooge's transformation. It's absolutely giddy! Enjoy and God bless us everyone."
5,The best of the best,"Alistair Sim's facial expressions, ranging from bitter to incredulous, make this movie one of the best British comedies of the 1950s period. Sim and the movie-makers never play Scrooge's selfishness for sympathy, making his change of heart all the more moving. Also, this version includes two key scenes left out of most versions - we see Scrooge's sister, the only person who ever cared about him in his childhood years, die giving birth to his nephew Fred and we see Dickesn's social message, those two phantom children, Want and Ignorance, huddled next to the Ghost of Christmes Present. The anniversary DVD contains a detailed discussion of the actors and others involved in the making of this movie - for instance, The Avengers' Patrick MacNee plays the young Jacob Marley and Bride of Frankenstein's Ernest Thesiger (Dr. Praetorius) plays the undertaker. ""Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?"" Is there no better version of this timeless story? I don't think there is."
5,The *true* Christmas Carol,"Whether you prefer the colorized or the original black & white, there is only one true Scrooge -- Alastair Sim. This is a true classic and is well worth owning.As to the actual dvd, I've only watched the colorized myself, but have seen no issues with the picture displayed."
2,Bah humbug,"Having recently watched the excellently restored 'Wonderful Life' in colour and black and white, I was expecting more. This is less. We have here, three black and white versions, one on blu-ray, two on dvd including a 16.9 version. I do believe the 16.9 version has been previously released. Looking at the cover, one might have expected there to be at least one colourised version. The quality of the picture on blu-ray is just fair, the 5.1 sound quite awful. This really is of little value if you have a recent dvd version. I purchased this because I have previously lent out my dvd's, never to be seen again. Scrooge would certainly have not purchased it!"
4,Finally! A great transfer!,"A brilliant film, the definitive version of this classic story. After years of frustration, here is a terrific transfer with picture and sound better than I suspect many people saw and heard when this film was first seen in theaters. I'm glad I bought this Blu-Ray disk even though I already had last year's Blu-Ray transfer. This has gorgeous grays, solid blacks, fantastic detail and (finally!) crisp audio. Just remember to select the original mono track to escape the cavernous sound of the synthetic surround mix!"
1,BluRaY Christmas Carol won't play,"I bought this Classic to watch the updated colorized version. When I put it in my Sony Player it said I had to update my software! I have no idea how to do this; so, for my opinion, this product sucks, Amazon sucks for selling it and I am (as you can see) very unhappy with the movie.A Christmas Carol (BLU-RAY) - 2012"
1,Beautiful transfer--but unplayable on Samsung BR players,"Everything played fine (VCI intro, the Maltin sequence) until the feature started. As with VCI's BR release of GENEVIEVE, all moving objects in A CHRISTMAS CAROL had a jerky movement to them as though the print was missing every second and third frames. Reminded me of a very bad silent stop-motion film. I suspect VCI must be using some new type of coding, but until I'm sure, no more VCI blu-rays until I'm sure thie problem has been corrected. Again, I've only seen this VCI blu-ray problem on Samsung machines. Don't know if they'd play any better on other players. Last year's VCI CHRISTMAS CAROL shows no problem at all. I wonder if it could relate to the higher TV refresh rates of today. Darn shame. The transfer looked good, but was unwatchable with this problem."
2,Good book for a beginner,"Books that I would recommend over this one: ""I Am That"", ""Pointers From Nisargadatta"", ""Be As You Are"", Talks with Ramana Maharshi, The Spiritual Teachings of Ramana Maharshi, The Bhagavad Gita, The Ashtavakra Gita, Advaita Bodha Deepika, No Mind - I Am the Self , and The Yoga Vasishta."
2,oceansize,Looking for more prog rock. Really can't find anyone to parallel Porc Tree or Dream Theater. Took ages to arrive
5,This is a great toy!,My 13 month old is in love with this car. It is built extraordinarily well. We think it was a great value for the price with the craftsmanship involved. We're looking forward to a lot of years with it.
1,some misguided advice,"This book doesn't really provide any advice you can't find on the internet. The author's tactics also resemble those of car salesmen themselves. For example, he recommends a certain company that sells extended warranties and goes into great detail over its product. I did a quick search of this company on the internet and found it had gone into bankruptcy and did not have the most reputable business practices. Yes, perhaps the author just made an error in judgment. Are you sure, however, that you want to follow someone's advice when it comes to spending this much money? I would think your money better spent just scanning over a few books at a local bookstore or picking a better book online."
4,Don't Sleep on Carmen!!,"Carmen Bradford's voice is a delicious blend of Natalie Wilson and Ella Fitzgerald if that is even possible to listen to without blowing your mind. From start to finish this albulm is superb, each song outdoing the next. My only criticism is that when covering Mr. Paginini she copies Ella's version scat for scat. You can't copy scat(you can but you shouldn't)it should be individual and spontaneous. With that said this album stirs the soul and should be a part of any vocal jazz lover's collection."
5,Argue,"My son has been wanting this game after playing it a few years ago at someone's house. We've never found it in a store, so I ordered it online for him for Christmas this year. He insisted on playing it as soon as we finished opening gifts. We had a blast, laughing, arguing, and learning a little about each other. It is a fun family game that everyone who can argue can play."
1,Complicated,"This game was more complicated than i expected. Wasn't very fun. Had a time limit per each argument, which was sometimes too long or too short. Game did not pique our interest at all and we will probably never play again. What a waste of money!"
3,What you expect for the price,"Product is what is expected for the price, no real complaints except they are a little flatter than I thought."
1,Save your money!,Save your money! Sunglass lens are substantially smaller than true Aviator. You can get these or better at your local drugstore.
1,Waste of Money,Please do not buy these. The frame was bent when I opened the package and they never sat quite right on my face. Terrible quality and a waste of 5 bucks. I accidentally sat on them a couple days later and let's say I was glad to throw them away ha!
4,Pooh's Big Book of First Words,I bought this book for my 18month old and she adores it. What surprised me is how much my 3year old loves it. She loves to point out the pictures and name them. The three of us love to sit and read it and both are learning from it. It is very colorful and the pictures well labled.
5,Soldier of Fortune,"Excellent movie, the book is better!! Having lived in Asia and some time in Hong Kong, the writer knows these areas and the culture. Makes a lot of difference."
4,"The CDs are fairly ok, but the booklet sucks","The CD is a pretty good intro on the most popular overtone/throat singing styles. The overtone-singing lessons CD is also ok. The booklet, however, is about how overtone singing can heal, bring peace to yourself and to middle-east and that kind of crap. Well, maybe my opinion is too biased, since I'm an engineer, too skeptical for that. In short, I do not regret buying it at all, but do not expect something beyond feng-shui from the text."
2,Great! If you don't want to know how much sugar you're using.,"I bought these on sale through amazon and was so excited that they were Fair Trade. I thought GREAT! Everyone is being paid fairly for their labors and its not coming out of MY pocket! I felt it was win win for the sugar workers and for me... Until I started feeling like something was weird. Every morning when I would make my coffee, it would never taste the same even though I always put 3 sugar packs in. It slowly dawned on me that every single pack has a totally different amount of sugar in it!!!!!!!! Some packs had about 20 grains (literally!!!) and some were so full, they burst when I tore them open. WHat the (*&@!#(*!&@?!??! Who does this? I started thinking that maybe the people who made the sugar were OVERPAID for their efforts and smoking a little too much hashish. Although the taste of the sugar was great..."
1,Packets but no Sugar????,I order this sugar on a regular basis. Usually I have no problem however in the box that I just received approximately 50% to 60% of the packets had no sugar in it. There is a serious issue with quality control.
1,Empty packets and grains clumped and stuck together. Not fresh.,"About 40% packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking. The sugar grains were clumpy and in some packets stuck into a square mass. The product seemed old and not freshly packed as I have noticed the fair trade packets to be in for example the local Starbucks locations. The product is not returnable hence a total waste of the $30, since our aim was to have received a fresh tasting and looking batch of sugar in packets to serve to our clients. Do not recommend to anybody. Would prefer our money back but there seems to be not way of requesting it through returns center. Not buying grocery items from Amazon any more. Too risky!"
4,GUITARRRRRRR!,"A Guitar Lover's must have. This is the album for the Air guitar professional as well. The style is ever changing from tune to tune...Rock, Japanese, Country, Klunky, Jazzy and Classical. My favorite is the slide guitar mastery, simply delicious. This album iws all over the place and can captivate your every mood."
4,Very solid,"This album did not receive the bestreviews at the time of its release but, looking back with hindsight, it's clear it's a very good album.This is the album that brought back Philty Taylor on drums, and they still had Wurzel and Campbell on guitars. So, it's a EXTREMELY heavy album. THe punk ; rock swing is almost gone, it's just sheer weight! The lyrics are, as usual, very good."
1,"Jericoholic # 5,472","This video is terrible. These kids are not the ""future kings of the ring."" They are dirty, ugly and most likely highly stinky. It degrades wrestling as a whole and brings it back to the Rasslin Redneck days of the late 80's and early 90's. If you want to see dirty kids Wrassli'n on the ground and bleeding non stop then get this video. If you have any of the Three I's ( Integrity, Intelegence, or Intensity) you will not buy this video. It is at times boring and it just gets old after the first 15 minutes. If you want to see real hardcore wrestling with clean participants (for the most part) Watch ECW!"
3,Not Their Best,"I hate to say this because I've always like George and Gracie but for me, the only reason to buy this collection of their movies is for W.C. Fields, who is hysterical in the one movie, otherwise I'd tell you not to waste your money."
4,Vallejo Fan,I am a fan of Mr. Vallejo and really enjoy the calendars. In fact I usually buy one for myself and one for my brother-in law.
4,nothing unusual,vellejo and bell ahve always put up a good calendar. and this year was nothing unusual. it definatley shows off both artist work. and is a very pleasing calandar
1,This game will not work on my computer.,After various attempts to make Port Royale 2 work on my brand new Dell computer I still have had no success! I have contacted the manufacturer who has given me several suggestions and I have tried them all. I will never order another product from them until they fix this problem.
2,"Forgot to ask me about property taxes, doesn't do amendments","I switched over to TaxCut from TurboTax because I hated TurboTax so much (buggy, spyware from TY2002, etc.). It looks like I like TaxCut even less. Either it forgot to ask me about property taxes, or I skipped it, but I forgot to enter them, and after filing electronically, I see no way to generate an amendment. I remember that TurboTax at least knows how to generate an amendment (though it cannot be filed electronically). Another thing I didn't like about TaxCut is that it imported some fields incorrectly. It created duplicates of some of my itemized deductions, and it incorrectly imported my children has non-dependents, even though they were clearly marked as dependents on last year's form.Looks like I have to switch back. TurboTax is not perfect, but it looks like it does better than TaxCut. TurboTax claims that they can import TaxCut data. We'll see."
1,No technical support; only wants $$$,I installed the wrong state version but found out this only after I finished the federal portion. It wouldn't let me correct the state and CSR emailed back the next day saying I had to buy an on-line version for the correct state. But why should I pay again for something I already bought???$$$ seems to be the only thing they care about.
1,Trash Product - No support,"1. The software was not for the self-employed (deluxe) as suggested in their ads, the ""complete"" package (...)more is not integrated with the original (advertized to be complete) product.2. I purchased the software, but then - and only then - was I notified that it isn't usable, and wont be usable this month. All the forms are wrong (e.g. 1040!)3. The ""Complete"" product installs in a different area and doesnt update the ""Deluxe"" product, but the ""Deluxe"" product required me to buy the second product during the interview.4. The forms for entering expences for self employment are more difficult than the forms from IRS!!5. There is no telephone support, and I apparently will have to complete a fraud report at my bank to get my money back.Ive used TurboTax in the past. ""TaxCut"" was a total waste."
1,Wasted Time Then wasted Money,"First the shipping took awhile so long in fact that I used Turbotax.com just to get an idea of what to expect for a refund.then when tax cut finally got here it was junk, clunky not that great and came up with a lower refund than turbotax. don't bother with tax cut and all the crap they try and get you install like earthlink. just go online use turbotax pay when you file or print not before."
4,good ol dance music,Starless rules I love that song. Realy catchy dance music. Try to listen to this without dancing. Trust me ive tried and failed.
5,Syrian is DEE BEST!,"I have always wondered what the future of music would be like, and I think I just found it in this band"
4,cute & comft,"I bought these based on reviews written by others. And they were all absolutely right. Running true to size, these cute little shoes are extremely lightweight and comfortable. Great for just running around."
4,Interesting and very entertaining movie,The DVD came in good condition and in a timely manner.I had not known about this movie before. I watched it with my grandchildren and they liked it very much. Especially the crossover between cartoon and real characters. Seeing James Mason brought back memories of many of his movies. As a youngster he was one of my favorite actors.
2,Still a Childhood Fantasy,"The only part I was absolutely afraid of was the scene with the home makers terrifying eyes when she caught the burgler. Even now I feel a spine tingling feeling. Other than that, I still laugh it all off."
3,Mel...What's the Point?,"...the same premise was explored in the Landis/Ackroyd/Murphy piece ""Trading Places"" and that was hilarious. The Brooksian brand of humour was not working here because as the moovy went onto things like being mugged and having shoes taken, they just could not be done funny...or at least not Mel Brooks funny. To the moovy's credit, it got Lesley Ann Warren in a bag lady drag that is quite funny at times, and touching at other times. (Elaine May could have gotten away with that role, not to take anything away from Lesley, though)."
1,This Movie Stinks,"This movie was barely funny, I only laughed twice and they weren't very heavy laughs either. This movie had a weak story line and an over lengthed dance scene which is suppose to be funny... I think. This movie seems like it can just stop anywhere near the end. So using a rating system like Leonard Maltin's I would give this movie * 1/2 stars. That 1/2 saves the movie from being BOMB."
2,No page numbers,"I have to read this book for my class and even though it is fairly good and easy to read, it is irritating that it has no page numbers. I wish I would of known this before I bought it. I would have gotten the hard copy. I can't follow along with the professor. Very disappointing."
5,Most books just a Bag of Tactics - This book gives you the Strategy and Approaches to make Negotiation Work,"This is the starting point for digging into the study of Negotiations. While other books dissect tactics this one provides the frameworks for negotiation. Next augment this book with ""Secrets of Power Negotiation"". One of the authors is the Dean of Business, Queens University. I read this for my EMBA studies cover to cover."
1,tedious reading but it is required for college.,after going through this book I seriously thought I had ADHD.... what a tedious reading... not recommended but it is required for college so if you have to buy it do like me and sell it back QUICK! LOL
5,Awesome,I am very happy with my purchase of Funny Games. I bought it on a monday and received it the next day. There are no problems with the dvd. I am very happy great movie...Thanks!
2,The joke is on the viewer,"I was told to watch this remake before watching the original, because after watching the (supposedly excellent) original, I just would not like the remake. I didn't like the remake anyway. The plot is implausible, the characters are flat and unbelievable. No parent would put up with the two little twerps invading their home and threatening their son without as much as a knife, let alone a firearm. Throw in the fact that the assailants address the camera directly, and you have a worthless film. Now I'm not sure I really want to watch the original."
3,Help Me Understand,"I own this DVD and other than the 'rewind' scene, that I dislike, I would like someone to help me understand a different scene.After the scene which Watts is talking to people,in their boat at her dock. The next scene is her helping Roth into the living room with hisleg wrapped up, and the conversation about her having invited people over, etc. Now my question is do I have a DVD with a glitch, does anyoneelse's DVD show his leg being wrapped, or a conversation inviting people over or etc. If this is not a glitch this is a very poor continuity."
1,"Boring, Terrible","Who ever said this movie was ""Not for Everyone, But a Very Intelligent, Thought-Provoking Movie"" did not see the same movie. I love violent films, but this one was nonsense. All the violence happens OFF SCREEN, and it was a ridiculous waste of time. I hated this waste of time. HORRIBLE"
2,"Disturbing, and somewhat silly.","The film overall is not bad. It is very tense in a disturbing manner.As some have mentioned most of the film you are wondering why the main characters are so passive, it can be a bit frustrating, at times.I liked the intensity of lots of the takes with still camera, it added to the tension of the film.Spoilers ahead...One thing I can't forgive is the very stupid remote control bit. What was that about?, what was the writer, director or whoever said to put that in thinking?, If you read this (director) you owe me 7 dollars (seriously).That bit just destroyed the credibility of the film. Absurd."
1,Disappointing,"It wasn't bad for the most part for a sadistic film,till what they did near the end with the rewind button.I will not say more about that in case you decide to watch.I then had to fast forward to the end just to see what happened.The ending would of been ok with me except for that rewind,it spoiled the whole movie for me."
5,classic study of military leadership,"Nineteen Stars is a laconic, discerning, and professional analysis of the factors which made Eisenhower, MacArthur, Marshal, and Patton the first-rate military leaders they were. The author's extensive interviews and correspondence have revealed many anecdotes and experiences which are published here for the first time. It is a most interesting, comprehensive and accurate delineation of four of our country's greatest military leaders and the qualities of military leadership. This classic study presents the testimony of hundreds of old friends, classmates, subordinates, and superiors of the four great World War II leaders"
5,Best present ever!,"We got this for our 4 year-old son for his birthday. His father works on Caterpillar equipment for a living, and our son always wants to be more like daddy. This is perfect. He spends hours with it, using it on his ""work site,"" and then fixing it when it breaks down. It is really big and takes up a lot of space. It fits best in our garage so he can use it outside. It has a similarly large turning radius, so it really won't fit in the living room. (We learned this the hard way).It took about an hour to put together and my husband said it wasn't bad at all."
1,Editing flaw,"I was quite concerned to find the lack of editing in a highly recommended book. There were misspellings, incomplete sentences, complete thoughts out of context........how could you sell a product that was in draft status?"
2,The Literary Equivalent of a Soap Opera,"If you're looking for ""love in the afternoon"" this is the book for you. If however you're looking for well-written historical fiction, you'll be disappointed by Penny Vincenzi. ""No Angel"" is just the sort of thing one might consider reading while on holiday, or recovering from surgery -- if you can get past the anachronistic but stylish front cover and horrendous editing (typos, words missed, etc.) The poor editing is especially ironic considering the book is a saga about a family's publishing business and frequently references the protagonist's fine qualities as an editor!Overall, I found ""No Angel"" quickly forgettable."
1,terrible book with no depth,"This book was not what I expected based on the reviews. I wanted a light, enjoyable summer read with some interesting writing and instead got a boring, poorly written book about a family that was dull and ridiculous. There was no character development and the story line was totally unrealistic. The plot (if you can call it that) was never fully organized. The author, introduced certain characters and than never finished telling their story. I kept on reading the book hoping it would get better, but it only got worse. This has to be one of the worse book I ever read and was a total waste of time."
2,Felt gipped at the end,"Like other reviewers here, I found Vincenzi's family saga unputdownable--but only for a while. I grew restive in the last third of the book as I sensed increasingly Vincenzi manipulating the ending so that the saga could continue. Some of the action was predictable (of course Lady C didn't run away w/ Sebastian), and some of it, downright implausible. Indeed, I just couldn't buy it that Oliver would be found out as having conducted a transatlantic affair w/ someone else's wife, which would somehow make Lady C feel better. Puh-leeze! I wanted to like it, I really did. But by the end I could see why No Angel was on the Strand's $1 rack."
4,No Angel,"Enjoy the book. It is a continuing family saga which I found to be a bit of history, romance, deception and enjoyable reading."
5,Perfect!,"What could be better? Genuine Flour Sack towels in designer colors. I love the black, it virtually dissappears in my kitchen."
5,Cute puppy,This puppy is awesome. And the price can't be beat. I checked out a lot of sites but found amazons prices to be the best.
2,what the &@#$*!,"for the unitiated william hooker is one noisy mother!!! lee randoldo is from sonic youth and zeena, well, i dont know anything there. this music, to me, is for the real avante garde listerner. you have to have a real keen ear for stuff thats out there. some of sonic youth's stuff is out there but has enough of something to keep it interesting and i love that. this cd is noise. little else. hardly a drumbeat is maintained, not a guitar chord can be heard. all this music equals is senselss, aimless, what-the-hell-are-they-thinking and i-dont-call-this music.there are a few moments of hope but in the end this music gives a bad name to good and true art rock."
4,From the dustbins.,"Renan's book on underground film is a classic ""introduction"" to the American avant garde. Good stuff on Brakhage, was probably a gem in its day. Title sums it up, just short ""blurbs"" on some pretty now obscure filmmakers... a nice companion or something. It's somewhat personal, there are a few filmmakers missing, but was written a long time ago in a land far away, yep. In some ways, I like it better than Sitney.Introduction to the American Underground Film"
4,Great no frills lap top bag.,"Sad to see this bag was discontinued. It was a great item - the perfect thing for my 17 inch powerbook. There is a new version, I believe but it has slightly more feminine styling, at least to my eyes. Only thing missing from this guy was an internal divider in the main pocket - a place to let you store a legal pad and a few papers without it rubbing on the computer. Ebags makes quality stuff. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of their in-house branded products again, given my good experience with this bag."
4,best,"This album is their best studio album. the title track is... enchanting techno? Is there such a thing? Well, they've created it on that particular song, and ""Unicorn"" is mesmerizing as well. They might have broken up a while back but at least they put out six albums and a greatest hits collection? And it's all GOOD. It's all transcendent."
4,You will be floored by this.,"I came to this DVD not only as a skeptic, but totally unfamiliar with the subject matter. Obviously I didn't come away any sort of genius on the topic, as no one documentary could do that, but this DVD is without a doubt a step in the right direction. Followers of the great Crichton Miller will be delighted to see his research and opinions receive generous amounts of screen time. The equally great documentarian Philip Gardiner has outdone himself. And as to be expected, he seals the deal with a downright (forgive the expression) toe-tapping soundtrack. Here's hoping Gardiner and Miller reteam in the near future."
4,Looking at the Sky,"If you have ever wonder how new stars were found, and how scientist came up with the alignment of the planets. Then read Blind Watchers of the Sky:The People that Shaped our Views of The Universe. Discover how the scientist came up with their theories, and the basic history of cosmology. The book flows very well and is interesting. Learn more about the thought of the scientist that have spent most of their lives studying the sky."
5,A Stellar Book,"I don't remember the last time I read a book that was as packed with fascinating facts about astronomy as this one. Better still, Mr. Kolb's dry wit makes the book a very quick read.If you're interested in the history of astronomy and want a book that takes you past the basics, read this book. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,Highly Misleading,"THIS BOOK IS CHRISTIAN LITERATURE. Don't get me wrong, I am not against religious literature or writings, however they should not be marketed as ""self help"" books. In the bookstore I was just cruisin around looking at titles and I had heard this book was good but did not know specifics behind its message. Nowhere on the book jacket were any Christian ideas mentioned (I read it twice), but upon opening it and reading the intro and first chapter, THAT WAS THE ENTIRE MESSAGE. The message is beautiful and strong, but what if my beliefs are anything other than Christian? This should be mentioned on the jacket and the book should be categorized as RELIGIOUS LITERATURE, not self help."
1,Don't bother if you're atheist..,"Waste of money, book is full of references to the Bible and God. I could go on and on about how pointless the story telling is in this book.. but I won't."
1,poor book,"poor book, nothing really worth to listen to. I admit it's cheap, and there is a reason for it."
3,It's worthwhile inspiration,"I don't want to write another book here, so I'll just say this worthwhile inspirational book didn't help me enough to change my life many years ago. Neither did any of the others and I've read most of them. On the first page, Dr. Daniel A. Poling writes ""... Faith in yourself..."" It goes overboard, I think, on spiritual mystical faith and not enough practice on faith in oneself. I'll coin a new word; it's more inspirational than actualational. I made my own discoveries and broke through, some fifteen years after I read this book, and some thirty years after I was too paralyzed from fear and grief to even move. But it's still a day by day process of healing and discovery."
2,Print is poor quality,"Content is fine. However, the quality of the printed text is poor. Letters in words are pinched and connected at the bottom in some areas. Some sentences have a wavy appearance as though the pages were a second generation copy. Text is readable just not what I was expecting for the price."
4,"A little dated in the presentation, but not the content.","I found myself a bit distracted by the lack of specific references as to who the annecdotes were about. A lot of ""a certain high ranking executive in an important industry, in a major US city..."" These days we expect to be told which executive in which industry and and which in which city. Maybe we have all gotten a bit more skeptical about sources in the Internet age.But that quibble asside, I have been making a concious effort to put Dr. Peale's ideas into practice, and found them very helpful. In another 50 years the presentation will seem more dated yet, but I am sure the ideas will be no less important. I am glad I bought the book.As as has been noted in many other reviews, this book is about living a rich, full, happy life in a Christian framework. If that's not what you are looking for, keep looking!"
1,Don't lie to yourself,Don't buy this book unless you can lie to yourself . It's not up to god its up to you ! How does a book about positive thinking piss a reader off on page two? That's not right ....
1,Highly disappointed by religious overtones,"I read half of the book and could not go on any longer. It was splashed with references to ""God"" and ""Believing in Christ"" and I could not turn a page without seeing at least 2 references to religion, namely Christianity. I happen to be an atheist, and the religious overtones of this book highly offended me simply because I bought the book having no idea that it was supposed to be this religious. Nowhere on the back covers or the introduction was religion mentioned at all. I believe the methods that the publishers used to market this book was highly misleading. Therefore accounts for the single star I believe this book deserves. And for you, Norman Peale, if you want to indulge in your religious rendezvous in the future, I suggest you not mislead or lie to the readers in your introductions to the book and place the book under ""Religion."""
2,Good for Christians - not good for me,"This purchase reminded me that I should always read more about the product before ordering it. I will read customer's reviews more thoroughly from now on.I think that this is probably a very helpful book for Christians who wants to make something more of their faith, or people who would like to become a Christian. 'The Power of Positive Thinking' is very well written, and many of the problems it speaks about is pinned down in a precise and nice way.Some times, the author gives interesting advice and interesting new perpectives. But the most given advice is ""pray more and pray hard"", and have faith in Christ.For me, who was looking for techniques in positive thinking, and who is totally un-interested in religion, this book is not helpful. So I will look for another book."
5,Great book,Book has made a huge difference for me really makes you look at the big picture and helps focus on what matters
2,text to speech NOT enabled,"I am so disappointed in my recent purchase of The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale. While I clean house, I listen to my Kindle read books to me. The reason I bought the Kindle version of this book is for this purpose, since I already own it in hard copy. Imagine my disappointment to discover the text to speech had been disabled on this book by the author/publisher.I would really appreciate it if they would reconsider turning on this function. Thank you for a chance to express my disappointment. I will know to look for this in the book details BEFORE I make my next purchase.This is the big letdown I have with my new Kindle Fire. It doesn't have the text to speech feature either. A real disadvantage. If I'd realized this, I would have looked for a reader that had this feature. Now I have to use my old Kindle to use this feature."
2,whatever,"This book was recommended to me but I couldnt get through it. I applaud its concept but its much more religiously based than I expected. If I wanted to read the bible I would, but I prefer the concept of power of positive thinking, keeping religion separate."
2,"CD in good condition, content bad",The CD was in great condition but the content was bad. Maybe it was too rudimentary for me but it was not inspirational like I hoped it would be. He's not telling me anything I don't already know.
1,Too old fashion and religious,This was read by a super old guy who preached biblically. Not very helpful for someone who is not all that religious
4,A Christian way of explaining the power of positive thinking,"The message of this audio book is very good, I have nothing to say against the content of the audio book. It is, true, as somebody remarked, not very long. I simply want to let potential buyers be aware of the fact that you'll hear a lot of ""prayer to God / Jesus Christ/ the verses of the Bible"" etc. Not being a Christian myself, I can get over it, but could see how the tone, voice, pitch and vocabulary of the delivery of the otherwise very good message could bother some. Although Mr. Peale does not sound like some ""Mega-church frenzied MC"", his tone and pace might be a little reminiscent of the exaggerated versions we may hear in the Christian realm. Outside of that, the message is inspirational and motivational if one can get over the format of its delivery."
2,The Collection,It doesn't have the soul and emotion of the earlier album of Curtis Stigers that I fell in love with. It has him singing his versions of some other people's songs.
4,Young girls should love it,"My 3 and a half year old daughter loves this Hello Kitty series, especially this particular one.What makes this a good purchase is that these stories are very G-rated and harmless. The best word to describe it is ""innocuous"". These retelling of fairy tales are watered down so that they won't scare the young ones too much. And because the overall plot of the story is that these characters are just putting on a play, it's one more layer removed from reality."
3,Turtle Color(RED) Wax,"It,s ok doesn't hide the white stained dried up bug spots like i really wanted"
4,Love this stuff,"Over the years I have used this product in black, blue, and green. Just got another car, so I'll need some red. I have found that the more often I use it the better the finish looks. Our oldest vehicle is 10 years old and the finish looks like it's fresh from the showroom. Using the product more frequently is the key here, not using it in greater quantity. Don't worry about different shades of colors, i.e., red is red, blue is blue, etc. Reality check: This stuff won't work miracles. If your paint is badly faded or damaged, this won't fix it. Also, the ""chipstick"" is only a very temporary fix for scratches. I usually don't bother with it."
5,Great fusion album,"I own the LP and recently 'digitized' it. Wow, Jeff Berlin's note-for-note solo on Crossroads. This dics has everything; great players, great tunes, nice variety, and even a dedication to Dirk, Lerxt, and Pratt! :g"
3,Fabulous musicianship - adolescent lyrics,"I love the musicianship on this CD. The ensemble of bass + cello + drums is unusual, but the group creates a lush groove that I loved. What I didn't love was the lyrics: they're often so crass and adolescent that the tunes are practically unlistenable."
4,Pretty good -- if you want to know how to sue,"I bought this book hoping to find out how those credit repair scams work. Todd Bierman doesn't go much into this as I'd like. He simply refers you to his other book, titled ""Guerilla Guide to Credit Repair).The Fix your credit workbook concentrates on how to demand reparations from credit agencies and what to do if they don't respond to your demands. He goes as far as provides stock letters for the credit agencies and a step-by-step guide on how to SUE in federal court by yourself.I'm not a lawyer, but I think its foolish for any lay person to sue a credit agency in federal court without a lawyer. But Bierman does do a good job in case some bold soul out there wants to know how to file a petition in federal district court.I just ordered the Guerilla Guide today and am anxiously awaiting it. The Fix your credit workbook is well written and a must have to deal with these pesky credit agencies nowadays."
4,Decent product,Seems like a quality product. Works for the purpose I wanted it for. Would recommend it to others looking for next step up from the $25 versions.
4,Great simple handy sound meter,I use this meter to take OSHA readings in our plant. It is great to show the workers how loud it actually is and helps them with wearing ear protection more consistent.
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Being a moderate fan of the Halo series I was interested when I heard about the Halo book series. Seeing that the price was lowered to a fairly reasonable price (in my opinion), I purchased it. The day I got the book was on a Friday afternoon and once I started reading it I could not get myself to put it down. The style and voice in the book is fascinating and I ended up reading through entire nights and finishing by the end of the weekend, it was that addicting. I highly recommend this book if you're a Halo fan or are interested in the series. Definitely ready to pick up the next book in the series soon!"
4,Does the game justice then some.,"If you don't know it yet; Halo, the Bungie game that was bought out by Microsoft to run on their XBOX is one of the best first person action shooters ever. Halo: The Fall of Reach was for me a gamble... how good can a story for a game be? It could turn out to be dumb and cheesy I thought. Not the case here, if you bought Halo or rented it and played it till the end and like Science Fiction than this book is the bomb baby!"
5,One Of Da Best,"This book rocks. period. The fall of reach is a prologue to the game Halo. For you guys who don't know what that means, it is the story that leads up to Halo (for X-box) So that means you don't have to have played the game Halo to understand this book. Eric Nylund did a great job writing this book. This is my first book by him and my favorite. He is a great action/battle writer and just kicks ---.The Guide to all the halo books:Halo the fall of reach- the story leading up to Halo the gameThe Flood- This is the actual story of Halo, not the best, but id read if you cant get your hands on Halo for X-boxThe First Strike- This is the story connecting Halo to Halo 2There, hope thats all helpful info"
4,Never played Halo yet enjoyed the book,All I knew about Halo before reading this was the game title and platform. It's a good read and Ididn't feel as if there was missing information - it stands on its own. Not all game books achievethat; I'm looking forward to reading Nylund's other Halo books now. The characters have depth inthis book and the Spartan program history unfolds at a perfect pace. Definitely find an edition withthe adjunct material.
5,"Great History, Best Game - Halo: Reach",Eric Nylund is such an incredible writer! The story is interesting and chilling as Nylund takes the reader deep into the history of the Halo Universe. There is no question that XBOX Halo fans will enjoy this novel most. But even a skeptic will enjoy this book. Enjoy!
3,....what now,i really like the book but when i finished the first1 i looked for flood on kindle geuss what its not there why woul they put the first book then the last 3 like what a load of crap on amazons part
