5,Corn fed,"If you are from the Midwest and don't have this cd, do yourself a favor and get it. After moving away from ol Iowa, the music of this cd moved me so much that I could almost smell the humidity, see the lawns of fireflies, hear the approaching thunder storms, taste the sweet corn - needless to say - very vivid!"
5,...remains the favorite.,"It's a tough call between this Red House offering and""One More Goodnight Kiss"", but this record remains my favorite Greg Brown album and one of my All-Time Favorites (mind you, most of Greg's albums appear on that ATF list!). Each song takes you through the country, no matter wh'er you live there or not. If you've ever sweated in a growing season or you've walked a gravel road, this album's for you..."
4,Witches Nightmare,I don't usually read horror. I'm glad I made the exception for this one. The characters and story were well established and believable. The author did not shy away from taking things to the limit. His use of the Salem history added a touch of reality to the story. It has an ending you could not predict.
3,I'm not too sure,"Although the idea was great, I don't think the execution was all that great. It took me several months to get through it. The first hundred pages were not engaging. It just wasn't what I was expecting."
2,Not worth its weight in gold.,"This was a cute idea, but this is more for a child's bicycle. Not very bright, so you cant see them even at night, past my brake rotors. After purchase, I came across these same lights in a dollar store, which made me feel like an idiot."
4,"Excellent background information, not very useful map","This guide provides excellent background information on the flora and geophysical and cultural history of the area on top of detailed information on the walk and beautiful photographs.But there are some negative points too:- The map is useful as an overview, but do not assume you can hike with it. Elevation countours are barely indicated, other paths and junctions are not shown (except major roads). So buy Ordinance Survey maps in addition! Do not think you can do without!- The guide is low on alternatives. No word about the beautiful Spink trail.- The guide emphasizes three reasons to start the Wicklow way in the South and walk in Northerly direction, but then continues to describe the walk North to South. It would be useful to finally have a guide that does it the other way around.- You will find little to no information about accommodation. For that you'll need Lonely Planet's ""Walking in Ireland"" or sources from the web, like wicklowway.com."
3,Better than the cheap ones,"This pencil is better than the cheap stuff but in the end, it's a pencil. It doesn't waste the pencil lead at the end like some of them do, so that's a plus. However, the pencil is a little fat in the hand, so that's a con. It's also very, very plastic. It looks like metal but feels plastic. It feels cheaper than I would like but still better than the el cheapos from a convenience store. No eraser."
5,From 5th grade till' I find something better!,"I've been using these pilot pencils since I was little brat that dreamt about what I would do during recess (eat grass.. yeah, I ate grass), and I absolutely love these little bulky shaky thingys. I love how you can shake this pencil and lead comes out. It's crazy!"
3,"shaker is annoying, but removeable","I bought this in a pinch because I couldn't find any of my other mechanical's prior to a test.The shaker mechanism is pretty annoying if you're used to a firm writing instrument, but thankfully you can take out the weighted tube inside and remedy the issue.What stinks is that once you remove the metal shaker mechnism, the pencil no longer feels substantial.I'll stick to my 0.3mm drafting style pencils for a finer line and more substantial (and noiseless) feel.On the plus side, the larger grip does make furious essay writing a bit less cramp inducing."
5,A Great Book.,"The Whole Shebang is a marvelous book that expertly explains the working of the universe in a simple and understandable manner, which almost ever reader will comprehend. Whether you're an amateur cosmologist, or just an average Joe (or Joe-Ann) who wants to learn a little about the universe, this book is for you! Ferris does a wonderful job of explaining all the basics of the universe, in a loose and fluid writing style, without overwhelming the reader, making the book a lighter read then some of its counterparts. Does this sound too much like a commercial? Well, if it does, I'm sorry. But this book is by far the best educational literature I have ever read."
4,"The book to read right after ""Shebang""","Although ""Shebang"" is a solid book, those who have read it and would like to read deeper into the current state of particle physics and cosmology may want to look at ""The End of Physics"" by David Lindley. IMO it is a stronger book in the visual images that it offers on such difficult topics as multi-dimensional space and the Higgs fields. But it is also more wise to some of the problems emerging within superstrings and inflation theory that may have as much to do with the nature of theoretical process itself as it does with the logic of the theories. Like ""Shebang"", ""End"" is extremely well written."
2,watered-down pseudoscience,"It is obvious that this book about the ""universe"" is written by an amateur. There are too many words used, too much pseudo-philosophy, and some errors (like the one on pages 230-231. How many zeroes are there in ten to the tenth to the twelfth? 120 or trillion?). Advice to the author: give the book to an astrophysicist for rewriting."
5,Ferris is one of the best...,"A nice companion volume to Coming of Age in the Milky Way. Ferris surveys the current state of modern cosmology and astrophysics. This book could serve as an excellent introduction or review of the state of such topics as string theory, the dark matter debate, the Hubble constant, etc. As always, Ferris' writing is clear and a pleasure to read."
3,"Disappointing, although very in-depth.","This book is quite long and I found myself flipping throuh to get any any good parts. It reads much like a textbook. The author uses clear language, but the book is not filled with anything exciting that you couldn't already get at your local library. It is not a bad read, but you can get much more out of reading ""The Inflationary Universe"" and anything by Hawking. If you have already read books on this subject, skip it.... If you are looking for a good, current book to start your cosmoloy education with, then this will be a good place to start."
4,Great value.,"I bought this paper to produce brochures for my small business. Works great. Prints nicely on both sides (HP Color Laser Jet printer). Folds with a nice sharp crease. Overall, a highly cost effective value."
3,300 count paper,"paper does not absorb ink very well!!! looks watery when printing pictures, looks very unattractive :( that's specifically why I bought these papers to print pictures.. very disappointed."
3,"good, not great, wanted to award the CD 3,5 stars","After reading the reviews I decided to buy this album, hoping to hear music as exciting and fresh as Varnaline's ""Songs in a northern key"". What it does offer is the occasional mediocre song(the title song for instance), strong rock songs (goodbye friend)and nice ballads. What it's lacking for me, is the experimental side of ""songs in a northern key"". Still reason enough to buy it."
1,Did not work for me.,This watch is packed with features and that is the reason I purchased this. The watch worked fine for couple of months and then I started noticing the problems. The watch automatically resets for no reason and I loose all my time settings. Then one day suddenly I could not connect to my computer through USB any more. I thought it was the low battery and replaced the battery with a new one from a watch repair shop. That did not help. I have a small wrist and one of the problems that I have with this watch is whenever I bend my wrist completely I end up pressing the buttons. I was not sure about the return policy on this watch. Anyway now its totally worthless and just sitting in my shelf. I do not recommend buying this watch from Amazon. If you really want to try it then buy it from a shop where you can easily return it.
4,great watch for a great dad,I bought this watch for my father for father's day. He absolutely loves it. He's a big fan of the Timex Data Link Watches even with more efficient devices like a PDA/Cell phone combo.
1,Poor Quality,"I got this watch for Christmas 2007. Three months later the low battery alarm comes on. Seriously? It beeps for no reason. The button is on the wrong side for left wrist wearers (probably most people). Changed the crappy battery only to have it fog up and seize up after. Avoid this watch at all costs. Ooh, I can hook up a USB to make a poor man's palm pilot!!Big deal. Skip this in favor of anything else."
4,Awesome watch but terrible wrist band,"The features of this watch are very excellent and its capabilities are unmatched, as of yet. I had bought the black plastic wristband version of this watch earlier and it tore apart after two years. A replacement wristband cannot be found in the stores except if you mail your watch in for repair with Timex directly.So I thought a metal wristband version would be a better substitute, I was wrong. It is uncomfortable to wear and heavy, and the watch keeps slipping. If you need to adjust the length of the wristband you need to take it to a jeweler/watch repair to get the metal link/s removed to the right length. I tried doing it myself using my own precision screwdrivers but could not.Despite its downfalls, the watch features still outweigh the negatives. If not for its terrible choice of wristbands, I would of gave this watch 5 stars."
4,Beeper died - twice,"I bought one of these watches when they first appeared. I had previously owned the older Datalink model, but the 'flashing screen' interface became increasingly difficult to support on newer computers. I find the ability to keep important information on my wrist incredibly useful - and far more convenient than flipping open a phone. However, my main gripe is that my first watch had to be completely replaced - under warranty - when the 'buzzer' failed. A watch of this nature without an audible alarm is a bit like a car with no wheels! Now, about 12 months later, the replacement has developed exactly the same problem. I wonder if it is a design fault? If it were not for this problem, I would give it five stars. The real problem is - there is nothing else quite like it on the market!"
3,I was an early adopter of these watches,"I had a couple of these DataLink watches when they were brand new about ten years ago now. Back then the data was transferred with a flashing CRT and an electric eye on the watch. Very clever.It is not an overstatement to say that the DataLink watches changed my life. Mostly it was the alarms. I'm the kind of guy who can get focused on a project and totally forget my next appointment. The DataLink watch almost totally solved that problem. I'd use it for everthing from business meetings, to taking medications, to sending out a birthday card to not missing the XFiles (pre TiVo or even VCR days!).But why only three stars? Every Timex watch I've owned in the last decade died an early life. OK, I am a _little_ [...] watches and I live in a hostile climate (the Arabian desert) but I finally swtched to a [...] Casio and it has yet to die. I USED to be a super brand-loyal Timex buyer (for like 20 years!) but no longer."
2,movie the forgotton one,"the dealer was very good, and i would buy again, but the replacement move was only slightly better then the first, so hope they come out with, an american made movie of the one i got, i did like the extra 6 minutes that the cut from the american isue, and i want say thanks to amazon for there help as well. ted"
4,good addition to grooming kit,These are great for when a nail grows too close to the pad as they are small enough so that the pad is not damaged and animal not hurt. Most pet owners are probably not going to be dealing with this issue on a regular basis like a groomer might. Would work for small dogs and probably cats for just regular nail trims. I'm used to a different handle and these are not easy for me to hold. They are a great tool for a professional groomer or animal rescue organization to add to their grooming supplies though.
2,"Band broke after a few weeks, not covered by warranty",I purchased this watch and the band broke after a few weeks. Bad news--the band is not covered by the 1 year warranty. Avoid this watch.
2,The wristband is a MAJOR drawback for this watch.,"I bought this watch for four reasons: the Timex brand, the interval timer function, the wristband feel, and the price. Timex always puts out great products, and I happened to find this one at a price about $10 lower than on Amazon. The interval timers are great for runners looking to do workouts without a coach around. The wristband is nice looking and feels great, but it will separate from the watch at the most inopportune times (like when you're running), and it is NOT easy to put back together. Some people would say three out of four is not bad, but for someone who will wear this watch daily, especially while running, this is not the Timex to get. Stay away from any Timex watches with this type of wristband... you will regret it!"
4,"Nice looking, basic running watch","This watch isn't too bulky and is definitely light weight. It has all of the standard Ironman functions, plus the newest interval feature (albeit only 2 intervals).Many find the strap to be a minus, but I think it's a plus. It just feels and wears lighter than the more common solid rubber/resin band. You might want to check your local Target or Walmart, though, who I found to carry it for $35."
3,POOR Waterproof,"Love everything about it, BUT, this watch is not very waterproof. After less than a yr of swimming, it is NOT waterproof AT ALL! Still works, but water get into the face so you cant even read the time for days, untill it dries."
4,Sturdy Watch for the Price,"I purchased this watch for my husband not for all the fancy timers, but because he has a physical job and needs a tough, easy to clean watch. So far, it has been perfect. The band doesn't collect too much sweat or dirt, and what does collect is easy to wash off. The watch itself is easy to read, fairly easy to set and program, and looks good. He has been very satisfied with it."
5,Great Sports watch,This watch is great. I especially like the interval training feature withit's simple interface to control 2 different intervals that can repeat or end.It's the whole reason I got this watch again after losing it.
2,The band sucks,"The band is a piece of garbage. I have had a Timex Ironman for about 15 years but decided to ""upgrade"" to the ""Sleek."" The watch is decent--it has a much more intellegent user interface than the old Ironman--but it makes strange electronic static sounds when I depress some of the buttons. But the band is a piece of garbage. As other users have stated, it disintegrated within a year. It cracked in multiple places and then finally broke. And due to it's ""advanced"" (AKA non-standard) design, once the band breaks, you're out of luck. I can't find a replacement band from Nike or elsewhere.I'm back to the Ironman that's served me well for 15 years."
1,"Don't Bother, watch band WILL break",Don't waste your money on this watch. The band WILL break in 10 to 14 months. Mine broke exactly 12 months after purchase. There are no replacement bands available. The watch unit itself does work well though.
3,Great watch - bad band,"This is the fourth copy of this watch I've bought. The watch itself is great and does exactly what I am looking for in a runners watch. Unfortunately the band as nice as it is will break. With my usage pattern that happens pretty much after about two years. Unfortunately the band is non-replaceable, thus the whole watch needs to be replaced."
5,Watch for swim work out,"This is the second one I have had of this model. I typically swim daily and these last much longer than other watches that I've had. Also, very easy to read during work outs."
4,keeps on ticking....,"Great inexpensive watch, does all i need for my running and different time keeping activities. This is my second one. The first lasted 9 years and i never took it off. Adveraged 2 showers a day."
1,Avoid Buying this Watch,"The watch itself worked fine for about 6 months, which is when the band broke. This, of course, renders the watch worthless. I expect a plastic/rubber watch band to last years, not months. None of the local jewelers/watch repair places could replace the band. Someone else said in their review that they got their watch repaired (the band broke, of course) by Timex via mail for $7.00, but why pay $7.00 to have a clearly defective product ""fixed""? Unless you have money to burn, do not buy this watch."
3,the picture is deceptive,"I recently bought this for my home. Had i read the description more closely, I guess I would have figured out that only one tray would be sent. caveat emptor, right? Based on the picture, however, I thought I was purchasing two trays. It works just fine and I won't go to the bother of returning it but I do feel that the picture is, if not deceptive, than certainly misleading and should be changed."
3,An interesting but somewhat rattled view of prejudice in America.,"Centered on the 9/11 disaster that struck New York in 2001, this Indian-produced film portrays the prejudice that befell Muslim US residents in the aftermath. The male lead is a young adult with Asperger Syndrome, certainly enough of a handicap in life, who encounters further problems because of his religion and his inability to defend himself from hostility. However his innocence shines through in the end, as he categorizes people as being simply bad or good, and makes that point over and over."
1,Unbelievable and unbelievably BAD,"This film is so ridiculous and unbelievable, it's laughable. It could have been good, it really could have. The filmmakers made it WAY too long, and tried to tackle WAY too many themes and issues for one movie. The film also left a really bad taste in my mouth, because it reinforced these ideas: 98% of white Americans are ignorant, racial-profiling, anti-Muslim idiots, 99% of Indians living in the US are way more compassionate and open minded than other Americans, there was mass anti-Muslim chaos happening all over the US after 9-11, black people are much nicer than white people, George Bush is mean and impersonal and Barack Obama is friendly and personable, etc etc etc. The hurricane scene was COMPLETELY over the top- I can't believe anyone could even watch it with a straight face, let alone release it as a ""serious"" scene. Please don't waste your time with this movie- it's way too unbalanced, biased, and ridiculous to warrant your attention for 3 hours."
3,Two big objections,"It's Bollywood's answer to Forrest Gump, and it's very affecting and entertaining. But here are the two biggest objections:1. After 9/11, San Francisco is depicted as a nest of seething, right-wing bigotry where Muslims are shunned at candlelight vigils and backyard barbecues, where well-groomed whites never miss an opportunity to taunt, bully, or beat a Muslim, where Muslim shops are vandalized and ransacked, and where angry Anglos tear burqas off of Muslim women. This nightmare vision does not accurately portray any corner of America after 9/11, least of all San Francisco.2. The scenes in Georgia will make you roll your eyes. The portrayal of the blacks who live there, especially the massive Aunt Jemima figure and her Buckwheat son who breaks spontaneously into song, is sentimental and patronizing."
1,Item does not work it appears to be used.,I have tried to contact the Friends people and all they want is for me to return the DVD at my cost. They sent me a DVD that is scratched and skips and freezes. I have asked for a refunf 2 times and no answer. They sent the first DVD and it was formatted for another country. This company is the first I have ever written a negative review. They deserve it shop with caution when using Friends THIS COMPANY IS DISHONEST AND DOES NOT STAND BY THERE PRODUCTS. THEY SEND NICE E-MAILS WITH NO SALUTION FEEL FREE TO CALL ME.Larry907-841-9880
3,"politically correct, emotionally manipulative, tear-jerker",I did enjoy some of the performances and if you let yourself wallow in the cheap sentimentality it is pleasurable at points. It's a little too long - an hour too long.
5,Roy's Best?,"Im my own opinion a resounding yes!. I still remember picking this up in the second hand dept of my local record store as a sixteen year old, and being attracted to the cover (I still love it in fact), and wondering who Roy was. I liked anything guitar at the time and still do. Luckily for me there was an informed hippie standing beside me, who told me that if I liked Pink Floyd then I would surely enjoy this album. Well, he was right on both counts, and nearly thirty years later I still have that same LP and play it several times every year, and will until the vinyl becomes threadbare."
1,Useless buy,"Buy any high/middle school algebra book. This book is full of non-SAT type drill questions. If you're in the 650+ range, looking to shoot higher, this book will not help you."
3,LP is sliding,"I was impressed with Lonely Planet's guide to Texas, so I bought this one for a trip to Pennsylvania. It covers the major stuff --- Philly, Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, Hershey, Lancaster --- but doesn't have much more than these major areas. I got ahold of the Moon Handbook for Pennsylvania and was...impressed. It guided me to places I never knew existed: Covered bridges dotting southwestern Pennsylvania, non-tourist infested Amish communities in central and western PA, winieries in North East, and the hiking paradise that I found in the Black Forest area. However, LP did a good job at the places it did cover, and I used it to select accomodations. Guess I justed wanted something a little more in-depth."
4,This stuff actually works,"My elderly mom fell and broke the cartilage in her nose and did some serious bleeding including drops on the carpet. The blood dried in and the cleaning woman couldn't get them out. I ordered this stuff and really soaked the spots. I waited about 25 minutes, much longer than recommended. The carpet is pink BTW. Then I took a sponge and wet it well and microwaved it for 2 minutes to kill bacteria and then started scrubbing at the spots. It was hard work but they came out. The most ANNOYING thing is that it's very hard to pump the product's spritzer and you have to pump it about 2 dozen times per spot. Then soak and micro that sponge again. You're done. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of that &%$#^& container."
1,Product falls way short of promises,"I tried this product on a dried blood stain on a white cotton shirt. I saturated the stain with this product and let it soak for 24 hours. When I washed the garmet, the staind did not go away; in fact, it got darker.If I were you, I wouldn't waste my money on this product."
1,Do not order from 8th street music - BAD company,"8th Street Music is also a bad company to deal with - stay away from them. After ordering an instrument and opting to pay extra for next day shipping, I wait and wait for the shipment. A few days pass and I get a call - they tell me the instrument price has increased significantly and ask if I still would like the instrument at the now higher price - I cancelled the order and have been spreading the word about their unethical practice."
3,"Well, it's okay","I have a 3shb flute bought new a few years ago. I prefer the much sweeter sound of an Armstrong I bought at a pawn shop, even though the Armstrong looks like it lost a fight or two in its day. As to the Gemeinhardt, the low b flat key is a good thing, as is the gismo for highest C. The 3shb's sound is techically fine and all, but this instrument just has no soul."
5,Cast Iron Scrubber Brush,"If you don't already have a brush like this one & you have to clean a cast iron pan, you need this brush."
2,Not so good,"I bought this brush to clean my cast iron grill pan and it's not very effective. Granted I cannot used dish soap on the actual pan, the brush does not give much relief in the cleaning department. It's almost as though it isn't sturdy enough to get all the cooked on food off. I imagine a sturdier brush would ruin the pan itsself though. The brush is better than not having anything at all though."
3,A nylon scrubber with the LODGE name on it,"It does okay. Its a scrubber brush with nylon brsitles. Cleans as well as any other nylon scrubber. I would suggest going to your local supermarket and buying whatever they have there. Any nylon scrubber will wear out over time. Its not a bad product, just not anything special."
1,awful,its a plastic brush. it melted because i didnt wait long enough for the pan to cool. im just glad it didnt stick to the pan. get a metal brush.
4,Just add warm water,"Product is as described. Works great at scrubbing the Lodge Cast Iron. No soap needed, just add hot water and scrub away all the leftover bits!"
1,Don't bother.,I bought this to clean my cast iron cookware. I used it for about 5 months and it fell apart. Lodge makes good cast iron but be wary of the accessories.
2,Okay but not worth the money,I bought this to replace the brush I purchased at the store. It is about the same but cost 3 times as much. I am disappointed in this product and will not buy it again. The only up side of this brush is that the handle is wood and not plastic. In the future I will buy brushes from the store or another brand on Amazon. After the first use the bristols were smashed - in other words the bristols are not very firm.
2,nothing seems,"to do a good job on these pans.... gonna use salt.... can't wash um... this gets some off, but not all.."
5,Scrub-a-Dub-Dub,"There is not a lot to say. These are very nice brushes. They are well contructed, and they do an excellent job cleaning my cast iron pan. We need to replace them about once a year, but they are inexpensive, and well worth it."
2,A pointless exercise in branding generic goods,"I agree with others that this is a cheap, generic brush. Also, because the bristles are nylon, they lose their shape if you are cleaning a pan that still has some heat in it."
1,Buy another brush,On using the brush for the second time. The whole head popped right off! Can't go back on because it's cracked where the metal part that holds the head on connects with the handle. Definitely wouldn't recommend!
2,If this 86-minute movie had about 17 minutes cut ot of it... it'd be 69-minutes long...,"At 69 minutes, this movie would be 17 minutes shorter than it'd be if it WEREN'T an excruciating 86-minutes.Naturally, given the BUDGET, the film isn't going to come accross as TERMINATOR 2.. or, PREDITOR 2.But, you can get this for as little as a buck-fifty..SOLD!I've got a Panasonic Blu-ray player, so I can watch it... and HEAR it at fast-forward... sixty-nine minutes...or even LESS.Some-times LESS is more which reminds me of one of the actor's NAMES: SIZE-MORE!Gotta say the TITLE says it all!"
2,Dissapointed,Purchased when it was on sale; thought it was great value. Was disappointed; the bag was oversized so my golf bag shifted quite a bit inside. I used it for one trip and the zipper broke. Returned to amazon after that.
3,"Not the book I'd hoped for, sadly","Being a library science graduate student, I was eager to read this book, thinking it would be an inspiring trip through the ages regarding my chosen field, so I was somewhat disappointed by what I found to be fairly dry reading. The history aspect is indeed there and the text is clearly well-researched, but the inspiration is lacking, unfortunately.The tone of the author is very subdued and rather droning, which makes for somewhat dull reading in my opinion; I had hoped for a more proactive voice but Battles just doesn't seem very excited about his subject and thus the book sometimes comes across like an intelligent but uninspired history textbook. However, it would serve as a decent reference book for students of this field; I myself was able to use some of its material as a resource in a paper for one of my library science classes.Ironically, I wish I'd checked this one out of the library instead of purchasing it."
5,Readers need know nothing about the freemasons; it's all here,"For thousands of years the Freemasons were rumored to control nations, with their secret society dating back to early times. Most of the great thinkers of the human race have been said to have joined the Society, from Mozart to George Washington and Charles Darwin: THE EVERYTHING FREEMASONS BOOK: UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY reveals all that's known about it, from covering myths and realities to considering its symbols and guarded secrets. Readers need know nothing about the freemasons: it's all here.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,super disappointing,"I thought this book would be one of those witty, charming takes on motherhood that as a mother I could relax with and share with my girlfriends. I was so wrong! The book was instead out of touch with the women I know who are mothers and failed to offer either humor or insight."
3,shattered LOVE????,"i bought this book believeing that i would find out more about Richard Chamberlain's personal life and loves, but this book disappointed me. It barely speaks about the man that has spent so many years by his side. It's more of a movie disography, more of his accomplishements in his career than his love life."
1,tease,"This is just a teaser to get you to buy the more expensive book. The accompanying cd has almost nothing on it, just a few borders and pictures. Fonts are supposed to be available for download from the website, but they offer nothing substantially different from the Word fonts. A waste of time and money."
5,Little Big Book of Christmas,"I've ordered other ""Little"" books and have loved them all, as does my grand daughter. PIctures are special, and to a 3+ year old, it's a nice size for her to hold."
2,not very good as a reference,"This book may be useful if you plan to study each chapter thoroughly, or even go through the whole book, but it should definitely not be purchased as a reference. The index is woefully thin -- a mere 6 pages -- which is extremely unusual and, IMHO, unacceptable for a book about a programming language. (I chose a C++ book at random from my shelf and it has a 37 page index, which one would expect from any useful programming book.) Because of this inadequacy, I think the high cost of the book is unjustified."
5,"Sad text, contrast the luminous photos of his sons & others.","Will Mcbride is as different as a man -saying he was a ""bad father""- as one can contrast with his magnetic images.Never spending much time with his sons or his wife, yet creating nude portraits of them and others that transfix your imagination. Images one would swear were taken by a man doting on his subjects. Divorced later he saw little of his family thereafter. Maybe the camera was the only instrument Will McBride knew to communicate his feeling.How fortunate we are he use it. Beautiful, yet controversial to some,this book establishes again why we should all thank our founding fathers for our 1st amendment."
3,"Its okay, not his best","I am a die-hard Laymon fan.This book is your typical Laymon novel...sex, gore, great writing. Do I reccomend this to readers..... YES.There are several pages in the book that for the first time in reading Laymon books, that I skipped over and those were where Allision debates on whether or not to have sex w/ her boyfriend. These parts were useless to the plot and didn't go with the story at all.As always I like that Laymon did with all the characters...where towards the end they all come together and everything pieces together....how he does this in his books are beyond me. He's a genius."
5,I have to have her!,"This yasmin is probably the most cutest one ive ever seen!I love her beaded skirt and the tinsel.I think these dolls say ""Back off Barbie"".This girl is an absolute have to have for me!GET HER!"
5,Love this mat,This is the first mat I ever bought and I am extremely happy I picked this one. It is thick and soft and perfect for floor exercising.
4,MORE BARBIE FUN!!,"I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my 5-yr-old...but my 3-yr-old appreciated them so much more. Really cute to see her all dressed up with the Barbie sunglasses, and carrying a purse. It's really a riot; the keys makes noises when you push a button exactly the way a real car alarm would.Really a cute, fun toy...and inexpensive!!DYB"
3,cute toy.but a bit pricey,"this is a cute purse with a few extras.I thought the price was more than it should be for what you got.My daughter enjoyed it for a week or so,then it went to the toy Pile!"
2,Too complex,"The SDM configurator is very difficult and requires even changes to the vista settings before it works. The automated configurator is not very reliable and I got intractable configuration errors preventing good operation. After several failed attemps and factory resets, it finally worked with a basic configuration. Unfortunatly, it is so complex and obscure that now I am reluctant to turn on the features I bought this device for."
5,As magical as the music it describes,"Someone once told me that it is impossible to adequately describe jazz music. He obviously hadn't read Fred Turner's book on Bix Beiderbecke. Part culture history, part semi-fictional biography of Bix, and always an artful celebration of that most-American of musical forms, this book is a masterpiece waiting to be discovered.Why isn't this book a New York Times best seller?Perhaps if you read this book you can explain this mystery to me. And if you read it, I guarantee that you are in for one of the best reads of your life."
2,.,"The review below has it down pretty well; and if he really is the bassist, I guess he *would* know. There are one or two tracks I'm quite fond of, and if you want to hear Crescent without song structure and just atmospherics and samples, this is probably the way to go. But if you're not already familiar with Crescent, I'd begin with Now. I think this is only 1 or 2 members of Crescent sort of doing an experimental side project."
4,Very interesting.,"I have no deep academic analysis, but I will say this is an extremely interesting subject. To see the pattern detailed so thoroughly, and to ponder where we are in it, clearly seeing that it is turning over once again, is eerie to say the least.It is not a cycle of esoteric causes, it is a cycle with measurable sociological roots, and when put in that context it makes enough sense to not be disregarded.This is a heady read, and is more textbook than historical journal, but the substance truly is unique."
3,"Sturdy case, faulty latch","I liked this case very much. Loved that it was sturdy, offering my TX excellent protection. I also loved the metal feel and finish. The only problem I had with this case was the latch mechanism. It lost it's ability to remain closed very quickly. I often had to bend the latch so that it would keep closed."
2,Bright enough to read by,"If you require a dark room in which to sleep, forget this little clock. It's very proficient at projecting the time onto any surface, such as a wall or ceiling, but is so bright you need sunglasses in order to get to sleep. Very irritating, especially for a clock this expensive. Note to Brookstone: Design a dimmer switch, so the user can adjust the brightness!!"
2,Completely Disappointed,"I purchased two of these clocks for holiday gifts (12/2010)after enjoying the benefits of the projection feature while staying with friends. After only two months, the LED and projection mode cease to function. Having purchased other Brookstone products to great fulfillment and satisfaction, I am extremely disappointed with this product."
2,Not too reliable,"We have had this clock a little less than 1 year. The LED read out on the ceiling has now begun to fail, showing only parts of the hour reading. Not a good investment."
5,Great as a natural heat protectant for Afro-textured hair!,"I Heritage grapeseed oil as a natural heat protectant on the rare occasion that I blow-dry my tightly coiled, Afro-textured hair. This product works very well for this purpose leaving me with soft, smooth, sheen-y hair.P.S. I use the tension blow-dry method to blow-dry my hair. Do a Youtube search for 'tension blow drying' for tutorials and more information."
5,High School History forgot something!,"It is unfortunate that facts/ knowledge of The Thousand Mile War had to be learned outside the class room. What is even more sad, is the fact that this book was never checked out since 2003 (at least), from the University of Alaska (Juneau), of all places."
5,Great Bargain,"Love this brand of clear transparent tape. Even after years, it doesn't yellow or lose its adhesive properties. This 6-pack was a bargain, too!"
2,Works well but not durable,"After about a year of use, the watch still functions fine, but the color on the silver part is rubbing off and the pink part is fading."
4,Much nicer than expected,"I love the indiglo effect. Easy to set, except for the laps and athletic features, those are confusing even after reading booklet. Nice though for a sports watch"
3,Not leather,"I ordered these for a teen who wanted them. I don't know what sport for which he will use them. The photo makes them look like leather, but they are vinyl. They came in a large size, though no size choices were offered by the seller."
2,Not as good as Neutrogena on the spot,I bought it because I love the brand but I expected it to be at least as good as Neutrogena on the spot and I saw no results at all.
1,"File under: ""Why did I buy this?""","This is a very low-quality mix. I have many of these tracks on other comps and they are mixed terribly here. The beat is monotonous and relentless. It isn't a hard-get-up-and-dance beat, nor is it a bop your head at work beat, nor morning chill; it managed to find a middle ground where you don't want to listen to it at any time of the day or night.This quickly found the bottom of my stack and hasn't moved from that spot to the CD player in a while."
1,Worst compilation I have ever bought,Endless tracks of uninspiring 1 bar loops. Complete and utter garbage ... avoid.
1,Green Thumb Wasp & Hornet Killer does not Kill anything,"I have tried this multiple times on the same nest. I saturate the hornets, and not one falls to the ground dead, to the contrary, they are back at the nest within 5 min...... even the nest itself is not tainted enough to keep them away. I will not be buying the product in the future, it is a waste of my money and time."
1,:( sad....rancid smell,I normally love this fragrance. I have ordered it before on amazon...and it was such a great scent. I'm afraid this bottle is rancid. The bottle looks like it's been around a while and even the perfume itself is discolored...very disappointed. The smell is giving me a headache...I don't think I will even be able to use it...so sad.
1,hate it,fast service but its me the smell was like a man would wear but the bottle was a very big bottle that does last for the price
5,Curve Vintage Soul,"Use it every day. It has a mature smell, not a citrus smelling perfume....I have used it for 5 years"
3,Not my favorite,"I bought this for myself when I bought Curve Soul for my husband. He liked his, but I am not as crazy about Vintage Soul for me. It's not too bad, and I keep trying it to see if maybe I just don't like it when I first put it on, but I don't think it lasts very long on me at all, I can't smell it after 30 minutes or so. I should have bought a sample first."
5,These markers are great!!,I have had a set for a year and they mark up great all the time and I just bought 4 sets and gave them as gifts to some co-workers and they love them also!
5,LOVED,"I recieved my package on time and was very pleased about the way it was delivered. The package was intact and looked similar to the picture of the product. More so, I took one of my highlighters to class, one of my classmates borrowed the highlighter from me. She could not stop talking about the quality of the color and the entire class was asking me questions about my highlighter and the place of purchase. I am very pleased with quality of these highlighters and I am looking forward to use it through out my undergrad and law schoo."
3,"Great block, but pricey for only ONE block.","The block is a nice size, great firmness and everything you'd want in a yoga block. However, for some reason I thought there were two blocks coming for this price. Don't make the mistake I did--know that it is only one."
2,won't cut your kids' fingers (or the paper!),"The scissors feel nice, they are safe (kid can't cut themselves with that).The only problem is that it doesn't cut paper very well either(i.e. could not cut the receipt that came in the box....).It would probably work ok on construction paper (a little thicker)."
4,Excellent except one small detail.,"I really like this watch. It's a nice midsized watch which fits my smaller wrist well, and the features are easy to use and convenient. I like the face color and the subdued Indiglo they use in the digits of this watch far better than the blinding full-face Indiglo of other watches. Lastly, the price is very reasonable!However, the black border on the crystal is too wide in the watch I got, noticeably wider than shown in the picture. The border partially obscures the last second/lap digit, making the number somewhat difficult to read. Additionally, when the light comes from the right, the wide border casts a wider shadow across the second digits, compunding the problem.I'm most likely going to return this watch. If it's just a quality control problem with this batch and I can exchange it for another that doesn't have this problem I will be delighted, since I do like the watch very much."
5,viva dictators,"If the above reviewer thinks the record opens slow then he really doesn't understand the masterpiece song New York New York. This is a fantastic live record of one of the best rock n roll bands ever. This is what the Dictators sound like on stage, loud, brash and near perfect ROCK N ROLL."
2,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"If you think you can buy this book and learn Pilates, dream on.The book has some useful information but don't think, like I did, that you can practice Pilates if you buy it.The exercises are NOT organized from easiest to most difficult but randomly listed, the directions are not easy to follow once you do figure out which ones to do first, and you had better be in very good physical condition before you start; otherwise, the exercises are impossible to do. The book feels like it was written by someone who's forgotten what it's like not to know how to do the exercises.The good thing about the book is that it's so frustrating it motivates you to go find a class, which is what I did. The class did the trick. We started slowly with exercises that prepared us to do the actual Pilates mat exercises.With the encouragement of the instructor, the new age background music, the commitment of others in the class, I'm well on my way to being a Pilates pro."
5,Good Reference,"I bought the Pilates videos and I've enjoyed them. This book is a useful tool for understanding the method behind the moves. It is written clearly, explaining parts of the movements most people would not think to consider when starting any exercise program. I was glad to see her point out that these moves should be done to the comfort level of the individual, stressing the importance of injury prevention. Included is a complete part on stretches/ exercises for dealing with soreness in different areas of the body.However, it helps to have some knowledge of kinesthetics or dance, as Pilates is about mental awareness of the body."
4,ready to try it,"I was intrigued by this book, having never heard of Pilates before and I am interested in starting a program of Pilates exercises. I feel more than a book is necessary, so I searched the internet and there are several Pilates sites to get more info on videos, books, instructors, etc. This appears to be an excellent way to train your body for strength and flexibility."
2,If only it cut straight...,"The pros: nice sharp blade, ergonomically-designed handle (you can cut for ages without getting a sore wrist), easy to store.Now. If only it would cut straight.This trimmer cuts on an angle - not sometimes, EVERY time. No matter how completely you line up the paper or card against the top edge, you will never (never ever ever) get a 90-degree trimmed edge.After a few hundred non-square corners and slanting edges it becomes deeply, deeply irritating. I'm back to buy something else... and not from Fiskars."
1,Head banging music,"I dragged this album out of my archive. Surely it couldn't be as bad as I remembered. After all, look at the good reviews here. Well it is that bad. In my opinion this is the worst Orb album to the date of this review and some of it is little better than head banging music. Don't buy this before you have listened to it."
2,Not Her Best Work,"I've only read four of the Richard Jury series (Old Silent, Load of Mischief, Stargazey, and this). I have to agree with several reviewers that this is not up to her usual level, although hardly the worst detective novel I've ever read. The scenes with Aunt Agatha and the hermit were highly amusing.One correction to another review - it was pretty clear to me that Hadrian's Wall was a nickname in the book, not the real wall.But this is not recommended as one's first Martha Grimes novel."
2,This book is a mystery to me!,"My first experience reading a ""Richard Jury Mystery"" by Martha Grimes. Not one I will soon voluntarily repeat. Such incredible talent in her bitey aside comments, and turns and twists of phrase... such a good idea was this story line... such a loveable heroine, Nell... somehow Grimes still manages to disgust and appall and infuriate me. Ugh. With all that native talent, how could she allow this story and these characters go SO awry?"
3,The Grave Morose,"This latest from Martha Grimes was easily put down through the first half. Picked up half way through with some notion of redemtion, but the ending left a fruther bad taste in the mouth. I can't say this was poorly done, but is is not representative of the Richard Jury series, more like her other books with dispondent aimless characters. (No matter how many time the work ""focused"" was used, unbelievably surmised from a photograph, she was aimless through out the book). The plot did not particularly hold together well, some characters stuffed in to plug obvious gaps in the ploting. I was expecting a more fun read Grimes, had I known, I would have read it a nother time."
1,How could any book be as dumb as this?!?!?!?!?!,"This was the dumbest book ever written. The author doesn't have one creative writing bone in his body. every book ever written by this sleezeball of grimy fat sucks big ones. However, the editor of the book didn't leave one grammatical error. don't read any books by this man. If your curious, read one and you've read 'em all because they are the same with changed names!!! beware: if you do read this book, you will find yourself getting progressively dumb and dumber!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,EARTH MARCH,I liked this book very much.It demonstrates that every one can help save the earth!.The part about mulching shows that every one can help create earth especially in march.I highly recommend this book to any gardener.
3,Death,"Mediocre. Uninspired writing, much like his other books. I keep hoping for better but he never delivers. About 200 pages, padded by notes for each chapter that repeat things in the main text.Occasional interesting points, but not enough to make it a keeper. Borrow it if you can for a quick read."
1,Waste of Time.,This is no guide at all and I wonder if this book was a death march project for Mr. Yourdon (considering it's poor quality). A much better book is _Rapid_Development_ which covers everything in _Death_March_ and much more. I learned nothing from reading this book. It's also a tad outdated (written in 1996 and reprinted in 1999).
3,"The ""new"" chapters are worth it","I read the first edition years ago -- after the fact. I had just survived [barely] my first death march project, and I thought it offered some good, retrospective advice. It helped me recognize at the very least, a death march project when I see one. Reading the second edition reminded me of what I disliked about the first. The raw emails serving as end notes to each chapter are quite repetitious and in need, perhaps, of editing.The new chapters however, are worth the price of admission, and offer lots of fresh perspectives and eminently practical advice.I recommend this book for anyone who is a project manager by title, or who is the de-facto lead on software projects, or wants to be, or may have this sort of greatness thrust upon them."
4,Don&#65533;t become a death march causality!,"A death-march project may be seen as a modern day chariot-racing event where the project manager is the gladiator with the whip, and the software development team is the expendable pack of horses pulling the chariot forward at dangerous speed.In order to maximize the chances of succeeding or at least surviving in a death march project - where most civilized rules of behavior have been stripped away - you need to read and understood the basic truths, brutal facts, and time-proven tactics that are explained in this insightful little book.The only fault I can find with this book is that it appears to have been written as a stripped-down death march project of its own. Many areas could use more elaboration to achieve better coverage of the subject matter."
3,"low budget, B movie","My initial reaction was that it sucks. In fact, I stopped it after thefirst 10 minutes of the movie and called my cable provider to demand arefund. They had the audacity to charge $4.99 for this 24 hour rental.The rep I spoke with refused to refund me. I went to bed, got up thenext day, and gave it another try. I figured I paid for it, I may aswell watch it. I'm a big sci-fi fan and I can tolerate a lot ofabsurdity with bad acting and poor special effects so long as the storyline is engaging. After my initial shock, I'd have to say that I wasentertained. I'll give this one 3 stars. It's definitely not in thesame class as Terminator, Matrix, I-Robot, or even Lost In Space(""Danger, Will Robinson!""). But if you like sci-fi more for engagingyour imagination than wowing your eyeballs, then this may beentertaining for you. It was for me."
3,Fly Rod Building Made Easy.,"I purchased this book as a gift. I skimmed through it brifly and was satisfied with the information it contained, and then passed it on.I am considering purchaseing a copy for myself."
4,Something not to miss,Excellent an introduction to this group. Especially helpful is the meaning of the various family names which has become a reference for me. Illustrations excellent.
5,tight,ed and kastro continue the legacy of mentor 2pac and fallen comrade kadafe you like that thug stuff you gotta cop it.
3,Review of My Body by P Carillo,My students learned so much. But it would've been nice to have typed text.
4,Great Book and Fun for kids,"I am not a school teacher but a homeschooling mother, and I have found this book to be a great tool to do something fun and educational with my 4 y.o. He loves this activity. He is a pre-schooler but I can see how this book would be useful for older students, maybe up to third grade. I do wish the text of the organs described could have been on it's own page and not the back of what we are cutting. Therefore, if you want to keep the description, it either has to be copied or re-written. In a classroom setting I can see how this would also be a huge hit, and obviously the text/organs will have to be copied anyway. Also, the quality of the paper is thin, could have been a little thicker. Overall, I would buy this book again. Highly recommend this book."
2,dull,Not like I hoped... more of a coloring/workbook for a classroom it seems. I wanted a more colorful interactive book.
1,save your money,"The cheapo 3M sponge style erasers (3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboards, 5 Inches x 3 Inches x 1.2 Inches, 2 Pads/Pack (581-WBE)) work way better. Even though this is bigger, you end up having to go over the same areas multiple times. And the edge catches and the thing keeps wanting to topple over itself. The product seems good in concept but it is poorly executed."
5,Completely eliminated the stinky smells!,"Our fireplace is old, drafty and smelly. We (easily) installed the balloon and noticed a difference within hours. Worth every penny."
1,A slander on Roger Zelazny's talent,"This is a wooden, stilted take on Roger Zelazny's original works. Two dimensional characterisation. Predictable and flat plot lines. Poor editing and spelling mistakes round off a work that detracts from the Zelazny legacy. Don't buy it!"
4,Helpful Book for Recent Trip,"I went to Egypt for 10 days in April (2012). I had the opportunity to take a last-minute trip and needed a quick course in history and what I could expect to see. This book helped immensely! I had a guide and driver for all of my travel, but the book gave me the info I needed to plan my tours and hit the ground running. These are tense times in Egypt, but with caution, it is a wonderful time to visit. I breezed in and out of tourist sites and was greeted warmly wherever I went. If you are thinking of a trip to Egypt, the book is worth having!"
5,An Essential Tool for the beginning or serious Watercolorist,David Dewey's straight forward and concise writing makes this among the best Watercolor references available today. I own over 100 watercolor books and this is one of the four I reference continually.
5,Master your mind in machine age,"I found this an eye-opening book on the nature of our thoughts. I make a living as a programmer while aspiring to create artificial minds, and, considering Gelernter's technical achievements, I became curious about this book. This book made me draw parallels with teachings of Himalayan yogis; it actually made me understand them more deeply. Whatever your reasons are for seeking to understand thoughts, this book is a must-have in your library."
1,Biased.,"Rise of the Vulcans contains some useful information. However, Mr. Mann is on a respected historian's PNAC list of 320 members, signatories, and authors. This would, from my perspective as a published researcher, disqualify him as an ""excellent source."" Far better to read Gary Dorrien's impartial ""Imperial Designs."" Mr. Dorrien is not a member of the PNAC lobby."
2,Fluff,"An amnesiacs guide to US foreign policy. Considering the author is from the Center For Strategic Studies, this should not come as a suprise. A fluffy, apologist and flag waving analysis, containing hardly a substantive critical murmur. James Mann manages time and again to gloss over some of the important national security and intelligence scandals of the last decades; presenting the reader with insites similar to the scrolling news headlines at the bottom of your television screen. Don't bother."
4,astronomy rules among ancients,"An excellent book which challenges many of the basic assumptions about ancient civilisations. It shows that they were highly interested in the skies, which dominated their day-to-day lives. This goes against the majority materialistic view. However, the structure of the book is sometimes not all that clear and the reader is left wondering what is the point the author is making, before it being stated only a couple of pages further on. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in slightly non-orthodox popints of view. It is a book backed by both Hancock (Keeper of Genesis fame) and Brian Fagan (orthodox archaeologist)"
4,"Turkey ""the only democracy in the Middle East?""","The book is great and well worth a read.But Amazon's product description for this book is incorrect.It reads in the last paragraph: ""Time passes too swiftly as Ender and Levent race to thwart the terrorist plan intended to collapse the economy and government of Turkey, the only democracy in the Middle East.""Since when is Turkey ""the only democracy in the Middle East?""The State of Israel is in the Middle East. And it has been a democracy since its birth in 1948."
5,"Sideways is a good,fun read","If you haven't read Sideways it is a must read. Extremely funny are Miles' and Jack's thought processes. Miles seeming to be the thinker and ponderer of the 2. Jack the wilder more carefree, ""How many notches"" can I add to my belt before i get married kind of guy. And the women they met along the way i.e. Dani and Maya were particulary fun characters. And wine lovers, this IMHO is a definite read for you. That said, I loved this book and now must go see the movie. Great job, Mr. Pickett."
4,Which way?,"I bought this book because I just fell in love with the movie. The book is full bodied meaning the characters are more fully developed and there is more to the story. Having finished the novel I now understand why Miles and Jack are friends which didn't really come across in the movie. The novel is very funny and poignant at times. However, there is a subplot involving a 'boar hunter' and a subsequent life and death situation which was unbelievable and a little overboard for me. Overall it is a joyful read and gave me a little more insight into the male psyche. I'll probably read it again."
4,Better with Pinot....,"I had a good time reading Sideways. I'm not one to usually laugh out loud and I did with this. I disagree with other reviewers, however. Good as this is, it really is a movie, not a novel. Frankly I preferred the beginning of the book better than the movie, but felt the movie-makers did a better job with the conclusion."
1,boring even to the end,"this book is extremely boring until about 200 pages in, and even then nothing major happens. i kept reading, waiting for the big moment of the book, or even just something to grasp my interest, and finished it disappointed. normally i love detail in a book but there's too much detail of the scenery and things that don't really matter. it was almost painful to get through some parts. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, i felt like it was a waste of my time."
3,Its episodic plot carries it,"A series of amusing episodes justifies opening then skimming through this poorly written book.The characters aren't likeable. One is whiner, the other a slug. The first is dejected because no one who had read his first novel will publish it. These days it's tough to get an agent to even read a chapter.Admittedly, the author has an ear for conversation; but alas the conversations between two unlikable yuppies are the sort you'd soon tune out in reality.Oh, and there's a lot about wine but without any real knowledge of the subject. No wine aficionado would consider drinking from a freshly opened red.The author has one or two memorable sentences, but relies in the main on Swifties--""He walked mordantly,"" ""She laughed tolerantly.""Forget the book; see the movie."
2,So So,The film was so so.The book is so so.What sideways does do well is show the true insideous nature of LA and its people
1,Horrible. Absolutely horrible.,"This book stinks. It STINKS. Unfortunately, I have that disease that requires me to finish every book I start. I have rarely come closer to curing myself than I did with this book. If this tin-eared author told me one more time that someone ``laughed robustly'' or ``clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter'' (at what was presented as yet another delightful bon mot but was actually another in the litany of insipid observations) I would have cried. Clearly, I can see why they made a movie out of it, but don't kid yourself into thinking this guy can write a decent novel. What a turd. If zero stars was an option, that would have been my assessment."
2,a light guide book,"this book is about some tours the autor made in the latin american countrys.I expected a technic guide about bike travel, but it s not.Only the kind of informations you ve got in other guides and not so complete.It s not a bad book, but it s not the one I thought.sorry to give a bad review, I m sure a lot of people have found good and useful informations in it, but not me.Max"
5,Magnificent!,"I've just recieve my copy of this amazing book (just two weeks to Mexico in a simple shipping, woah!), and I can't be more excited and satisfied. Judika really do her homework, and it's a MUST HAVE if you're interested over the magic sciencie and the ocultist tradition.It has everything. Yes, everything. Even spells I've learn from witches in my country, I found them in this book. I truly was amazed and shocked: ""Why this spell is in here?!"" It's pretty complete. An excellen investment."
4,Hard worded,"My daughter, who loves Harry Potter, got this book and was upset with how many wordes she could not say or read, but as far as the book went, she loved it."
3,Good for an author who not a writer by profession,"Heidi Cortez is not a writer but really made her name in auto recordings of her short stories. I sure reading this outloud who enhance the stories. They're all really short and an easy read, just enough light reading before bed...as they are intended."
1,Not Made in America,"Wouldn't Sam Walton be rolling over in his grave to find out how little that is sold at Wal-Mart now is actually made in America? Have you noticed they don't use that marketing ploy any longer? And what about the numerous jobs in the US that have been lost due to Wal-Mart's policy that requires that US companies (who want to do business with Wal-Mart) sell things so cheaply to them that the company has to have things made overseas to make a profit. Has anyone in your family lost a job to an overseas or non-US company? If so, think again about Wal-Mart and truly buy something that was MADE IN AMERICA!!!!!!"
1,"Should be named ""Made in China""","Wal-mart is responsible for the destruction of 1,000s of retailers and many well known American manufacturers all in the name of low prices. If you read this book, you should also read ""The Wal-Mart Effect"". I guess there is good and bad in everything!"
5,Must-read book for entrepreneurs,"After working for Wal-Mart stores, I have seen first-hand the greatness of this man and his business. This book teaches one to follow his/her dreams, because you can reach your goals.......Sam was proof."
5,Fascinating,"""Made in America"" chronicles the meteoric rise of an unlikely billionaire: Sam Walton, who founded Wal-Mart and changed the way of doing business in thousands of small towns in America. The book is candid, enlightening and even funny, a real treat for any would-be entrepreneur. And you don't have to agree with all of Mr. Walton's conclusions about the Wal-Mart effect to learn a great deal from his memoir. Kudos to John Huey, the co-author, for writing a compelling book that maintains Sam Walton's voice."
2,Flimsy for an Orbee,"My pup is a chewer. He can pop a tennis ball in about 2 minutes. We have given him many orbee balls and toys before (snowball, football, strawberry are his favorites) and they have all stood up to his gnawing and weathering (he will leave them outside when the doggie door is up at times).While visually appealing and with a great smell that attracted him, this orbee does not hold up to the same standard that we held other orbee products. he tore and ripped the screw portion of the red bulb within seconds. just touching it, it felt flimsy. this was without any treats or anything inside. I imagine if he had real motivation to get inside, he would have this completely shredded in a matter of seconds.Fast Shipping from this seller, but a far inferior product. I highly recommend any of the other aforementioned products, but stay away from this one.1 star product with 1 star added for good seller. item came exactly as expected in a timely manner."
4,Still the best guide to cat breeds,"I've owned this book (the eyewitness edition, actually) for years, and it's still the best and most comprehensive photographic guide to cat breeds that I've seen. Great, clear photographs featuring both common and some rarer breeds in all the major color variations for each breed, as well as lots of good, interesting info on each breed and its history.A must have for cat lovers!"
5,Love it!,My one year old bounces up & down with several of the tracks on this CD! A really peppy good time . . . just as fun for the adults as it is for the children. Not sappy & annoying like most children's music.
3,Pretty Good,"The bottle works fine and is easy enough to use. Arrived on time and was as the description states with the exception of one thing. It did not mention it was for toy breeds. Had I noticed that on my own I would have ordered the bigger one but honestly is big enough, its not like hamster sized.It is a tad bit drippy but all of these bottle types drip (drips more than average but not enough to worry about a mess). I would like it to state ""Toy Breeds"" for the slow people like me."
4,Spin It,"I think this is a great little book that covers a variety of information on spinning and learning to spin specifically with a spindle. The information that is not covered is how to choose a spindle. Specifically how to choose a spindle related to what you would like to spin. What does weight of the spindle have to do with my choice of spindles? If this information is in the book, I do not see it.I did find the information that I need in an old copy of Spin Off magazine, so I really did not need the book at all."
2,Now This Bothers Me,"I might not be of this lastest generation, but I do read their magazines. It seems to me that this other eader response posted is written by a young poet who was published by the press that is run and owned by this poet here, Mrs. Wolfe. This seems like bad form, ladies. I suppose it would be simply annoying in and of itself, but added to the fact that this book is simply awful makes this kind of back-scratching very misleading for the average reader. I do not think that one has to be a good poet to be a good editor, and visaversa. I'll leave it at that."
5,Good Fragrance,"This product was received in great condition and sooner than expected. The fragrance is really good, and I recommend anybody to try it. I have received many compliments."
5,Very pretty doll,"This is a very pretty doll. It has two outfits and you can also change the ""shoes"" or take the earings off. My daughter plays with it for hours and she is always showing it off to her friends. Great buy and the perfect present for any little girl!"
3,Open barn door...,Interesting story. Glad I don't have kids with so many guys like this roaming the streets
3,Tea Shop Series- Book 2,"Theodosia Brown owns a quaint tea shop in Charleston and is entangled in another mystery when an accident at the annual yacht race turns out to be murder.As with many `cozy' mysteries, the mystery isn't always the main focus of the book. Rather the off beat characters and their interactions, as well as the prerequisite recipes are. As light mysteries go this was an easy read, although I could see the end coming a mile off. I do enjoy the stories of tea, as well as Theo's interactions with her circle of friends, and the author's loving and detailed descriptions of Charleston. I do find the conversational language to be rather stilted and wonder if Charlestonian's actually speak like this.I may be a bit burned out on the cozy mystery as this is the second one I read this month and found it to be just okay."
4,Second in the series,"Theodosia Browning and her employees from the Indigo Tea Shop enjoy serving their favorite beverages to people who are watching the Isle of Palms Yacht Race. Unfortunately the day is ruined when a prominent citizen from Charleston is killed while shooting an antique gun to signal the end of the race. He seemed like a solid citizen, but soon Theo has come up with a variety of suspects who would have a motive for murdering him. As usual this book is filled with interesting tidbits of information about Charleston and different kinds of tea. This is another good entry in the series."
4,Less cozy but still warm,"Was excited to read this after the first tea shop mystery, which I quite enjoyed. While I still liked this book, I didn't feel this was quite as ""cozy"" a mystery as the last. The plot seemed a little thin. The main charactor was a bit less engaging. I will still continue to read the series. They are light and easy reads, good for in between more serious books."
3,"Excellent condition...""so-so"" story...","I thought I found a fun new series to read between my more serious books but this was a little too ""fomulaic""...although I do love the Charleston setting."
4,good resource,"I fyou are serious about your medical knowledge, this is a good reference source to keep around."
3,It's a doll,"It is like every other barbie doll my daughter received. She plays with it for a little while and then it sits in her closet. She will bring it out again when her friends come over, but then it goes back in the closet. It isn't her favorite, but she won't throw it away or donate it either. Doesn't help much does it?"
3,"Excellent perfume, bad shipping","Smells good, my wife loves it. The order proccessing and shipping took way too long, item was very late arriving."
3,Guilty Fun,"Hey, what can I say, its enjoyable (at a certain level). Its not a really deep picture, but you knew that already. Nice photography and locations and the acting is fine. You will appreciate it more if you don't compare it to the other classic underwater pictures. Instead, just sit back and let it wash over you. Pure guilty fun."
2,A failure,"****** SPOILERS ******This movie had temporary potential in the very beginning, but just went downhill. The dialogue was cliche and plot predictable. The characters made unrealistic decisions that lead to their deaths. Idiocy spread like the raging water that filled the caves. I was surprised all the females died because usually a female always makes it out alive with the surviving hero, or the female herself is the lone survivor. However, all the females in Sanctum were idiots and didn't deserve to survive. I felt more people should have survived. I think if they threw a supernatural element into the story it could have gone way further given the location and plot. On the pros side, the sets and locations were nice.I'm happy I didn't pay to see this in theaters or heaven forbid buy it."
2,Not worth the 3D version,movie was decent for a sci-fi. You're better off watching it in regular DVD or blu-ray. There weren't too many special effects to warrant the purchase for the 3D version. Wish I had known that before paying the extra cost for it. Oh well...
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER,Do not waste your hard earned money.You will be pi$$ed off. Terrible Terrible Terrible movie. I fell asleep 4 times. Purchase only if you have trouble sleeping. James Cameron should be ashamed of himself.
5,all stars for this movie,"i ordered this movie and let me tell you it got delivered on time, and also when i open the box the movie was iin great condition so the delivery went wellthis movie is great once the story thickens you cant help but to sit and watch in amaze at some of the things that happens in this film...i love movies based on true events and i i would recommend this movie to my friends, family , etcglad i decided to buy it (:"
3,"A slow moving but thrilling escape movie. Almost like ""The Way Back"" in water. Good movie, but must be in mood for it. I say B-","""What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?"" While trying to explore an unseen part of the world a group of divers become trapped in an underwater cave. When they realize the only way out is to keep going the hardship begins. This is based on a true story, much like ""The Way Back"" it involves a group trying to escape to freedom. Not only do they have to deal with the elements, but also the other divers trying to escape by any means necessary. The best way to explain this is ""The Way Back"" in water. If you liked that movie you will like this one as well. Very suspensful and thrilling but also very slow moving in some parts. Entertaining and adventerous but be prepared for it to be a little slow. Overall not a bad movie, but nothing amazing. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will*Also try - The Cave & The Way Back"
2,Disappointing,"Other than the one interesting aerial shot of the cave which you see in the trailers over and over again, and a few moments of father-son bonding, almost nothing else in this movie is worth watching. It looks and feels bad all the way to the end. You don't really identify with any of the characters (famous or not), and what's happening (or will happen) to them. Mostly closeup shots taken in dark and confined places only effectively convey the claustrophobic pain to the viewer, but none of the adventure, excitement or anything to satisfy your sense of curiousity about this darned cave. Don't fall for the name 'James Cameron'. He probably had very little to do with it. He allowed his name to be used for marketting purposes - or is getting too old and tired these days. The movie seems to have been produced in a big hury just to sell tickets while we still remember Avatar believing that maybe it's going to be another masterpiece by James Cameron."
2,"Over hyped. Slow, nothing spectacular, feels like documentary.","This movie was way over-hyped. Nothing special about this movie. Go spend your money on THE CAVE. Sanctum feels like The Cave but without any horror, feels like a documentary gone bad. I will not rent nor buy this movie, wasted my time watching it via Netflix."
2,Had potential...,"This movie had potential, but it eventually flopped. The dialog was terrible, as well as the acting. Some of the scenery was outstanding, but not worth boring yourself for two hours. Sorry James, this one was a loser..."
3,Weird,"The financier seemed too immature, but so did his girlfriend. The dad seemed like his temper was too hot for anyone who survives for a living. The death scenes were more grisly than I expected. Between the characters there was this bipolar action going on: ""I can't do this!"" ... ""Yes, you can! I love you."" ... ""OK, I can! Onward!""Really, it was weird.Weird I tell ya."
5,Greatest bag ever,"I bought this for my dad. He always keeps his golf stuff in the truck of his car.If I needed to use the car for anything he would say well you can't use the trunk it is full of golf stuff. So when I saw this I said, oh yeah. When I gave it to him he thought it was a new toy, He loved it. He put everything from the trunk in this bag. A few days ago he told me that he was going to take his grandsons fishing and needed the trunk and all he had to do was lift out the case. This is a great deal. The bag is very spacious and has a place for everything. Thank you!"
2,Disappointing,The Samsonite golf trunk organizer disappoints. It looks great in the Amazon image but when you actually use the organizer it is too flimsy and you end up trying to organize the organizer everytime you use it.
4,Handy organizer,This seems to work pretty well. The only problem is that the lower compartment collapses from the weight of items in the top. There are rigid stays in the bottom but they come off the velcro that holds them in place. If you have shoes in bottom they seem to remain in place. Overall I am quite pleased with this. It is much better than the duffel bag I was using.
5,Excellent golfer's tool,Husband says it will prevent him from the stress of finding all of his equipment before the trip to the course.Fits nicely in the trunk. Was a great Christmas gift.
2,"Not the standard 1/8"" (=3.5mm) stereo plug","Buyer beware with this item. I thought that I was buying a product with a ""standard"" 1/8"" stereo plug. After receiving the product, I realized that it does not have a ""standard"" 1/8"" plug. A 1/8"" plug is 3.5mm and this plug is 2.5mm. Yes, I suppose that I should have known the difference before placing the order, but there should be a warning of some sort to notify the buyer that 2.5mm is not a ""standard"" 1/8"" earphone plug. Yes, I know that I can return the item for a refund, but the return shipping is the same as the cost of the product. Instead, I ordered and received another earphone with the ""standard 1/8"" = 3.5mm plug. Note that when I followed up directly with Amazon they immediately agree to a full refund. That's why I like to shop with Amazon."
3,Lots of info but hard to understand,"Ok SO this product is full of all kinds of helpful information; however, the instruction manual is all in Kanji and being that i dont know any Japanese it is completely useless. Luckily i have a few friends who speak english but none of them have the time to show me how this game works. It has the potential to help you learn Japanese but it does not have anything written in English in the instructions as i said before and it doesnt have any english in game either. All in all it is just an OK product."
5,Excellent Movie!,"My daughter LOVES this Veggie Tales DVD and watches it year round. Wonderful story, and very fun for grown-ups too!"
3,Lavender oil Okay,"I was pleased to receive this bottle of Lavender oil as quickly as I did. The lavender oil smells nice, but the true lavender scent is not as strong as I had hoped. I have never bought lavender oil before, so perhaps this is how they all are. I wanted to make a linen spray with the oil. I only wish there were more to the contents, but I am happy with it overall."
5,lavender bliss,"I received this purchase quickly and in perfect condition. What a wonderfully relaxing aroma! I recommend this for making Yule presents - bath salts, bath oil, lotion, etc. Reconstitutes perfectly with any medium."
5,Great product!,I received the product very quickly and it's exactly what I needed and excpected! I will absolutely buy from this seller again!
2,Cheaply Made in China,"Ganesh statue is made in China, poorly painted. It is a very cheap-looking statue to be placed on an altar. It was nicely packaged, but I am looking elsewhere."
1,This is why I avoid Amazon whenever possible,"They do not monitor what is on their site or possible worse, don't even know what is on their site. $1500 for a report from 5 years ago???? Do they even have anyone that monitors the products that are put up here?"
1,Error,Read only the forward. I realized the author had little to no understanding of what Christ did on this earth. Put the book in the recycling. It is not worth reading any further.
5,WHAT OTHER BACKGROUND BESIDES THE BIBLE?,"I CONSIDER THAT THERE IS NOT BETTER BACKGROUND THAN THE HOLY WORD (BIBLE) THROUGHOUT CENTURIES.THE WORD IS CLEARLY DISPLAYED IN TABERNACLE I & II AS WELL AS ALL PASTOR PAUL JONG'S BOOK WRITTEN UNDER A COGNITIVE FORMAT, NOT FROM FEELINGS NOR EVEN RANTING AS MENTIONED BY MR. LUSCHER.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO EVERY READER THAT FIRST WE SHOULD READ THE BIBLE AND STUDY IT, AND PERSONALLY FROM ALL PAUL JONG'S BOOKS, I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD READ "" HAVE YOU TRULY BEEN BORN AGAIN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT"".IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THE MAIN THEME OF THE HOLY WORD WHICH IS "" THE GOSPEL OF THE WATER AND SPIRIT"" THE ONE AND ONLY GOSPEL, EVERYTHING ELSE IS UNIMPORTANT AND IRRELEVANT.DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE. (JOHN 8, 32)MAY THE GRACE OF GOD BE WITH YOU PASTOR PAUL JONGANA MARIA CORONADOPERU"
4,In support of the Social Enterprise,"Having designed and deployed social enterprise applications for several years, I read ""The hidden power of social networks"" a second time to contrast my own experiences against others. I was compelled to recognize that many if not most of Cross and Parker's insights are still very valid today. Their focus on developing a sense-and-respond organizational capability, as well as, creating energy in organizations is dead-on. With the benefit of hindsight, I would say that the power of social networks is no longer hidden and that even greater attention should be placed on the ""networked"" rather than the ""network"" itself. Today, applications like Linkedin, Jive and Lithium are enabling much more dynamic, portable and adaptive networks, allowing spontaneous ""natural hierarchies""!"
3,Keep It Simple--Book Is Unnecessarily Complicated,The book takes relatively straight forward ideas and beats them to death by overanalyzing them. The overly rigorous analysis would be more fitting for a more difficult subject and not for this simple area. This is a hard read.
5,"This is a ""Must Have"" book.","I have a large shelf of books on indian basketry. This Shanks book will be put first in line. For the tribes included, the book covers historical, cultural, and ethnographic aspects in a very readable form. But its unrivaled aspect is in diagnostics and the technical details. Boring? Hardly! The authors show how the artisitic and aesthetic values derive from the weaving details. The authors trace the migration and fate of tribal peoples through analysis of their weaving. While the book is of ""coffee table"" quality, it not just a pretty once over dust catcher. I will certainly buy their next volume in the series.To anyone interested in the artworks or culture of the American Indian, this is a must have treasure. In fact, it can well stand first in line among any indian textile, carving, pottery, or beadwork books that I have ever seen."
2,A Boy's fictional adventure book set during WWI,This book is not a Historical text but it is an adventure book for young boys growing up in that time period. Two 15 year old boys almost winning the u-boat war by themselves and capturing German spies as well? Fiction for sure. That not what I was expecting so that's why the lower rating.
2,Would Not Reccomend for Beginners,"As a beginner, I find this book to be a tough read because there are no exploded diagrams indicating the technical names of the parts referred to in a given set of instructions. The pictures that accompany the instructions do little illustrate what the instructions are referring to. A book w/ diagrams might allow a reader to spend more time on the bike and less time trying to decipher the instructions."
3,decent workhorse,"Ours just finally died after about 14 years (this is a 1998 model). It worked fine for most of that time. The last couple of years, there was some problem with the screen on the upper right of the interior, that caused it to spark and arc occasionally if the food load was small. We probably should have replaced it earlier. We used the Minute Plus button for almost everything; it's usually much more convenient than setting a specific duration using the numeric keypad. I would hesitate to buy a microwave without that feature. Anyway, decent average workhorse microwave, plus a little for convenience and durability, minus a little for the arcing problem and some unevenness when defrosting: net 3 stars."
3,Songs of Leonard Cohen,"This book contains the music, written out for guitar and vocals, of the following songs: A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes; Bird on the Wire; The Butcher; Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye; Lady Midnight; Master Song; The Old Revolution; One of Us Can Not Be Wrong; Priests; Seems So Long Ago; Nancy; Sisters of Mercy; So Long, Marianne; Stories of the Street; Story of Isaac; The Stranger Song; Suzanne; Teachers; Tonight Will Be Fine; Winter Lady; You Know Who I AmThere are also a good number of pictures and an article written about Cohen in 1968, pulled from the New York Times.I gave it 3 stars only because I haven't any clue as how the well tablatures are transcribed, coz I don't play the guitar."
3,"Nice anecdotes, but thin on added value","First off, this book really needs a good edit. I suspect that its publication schedule did not allow time for sufficient proofreading. Second, the book contains nice anecdotes of various companies' adventures in e-commerce, and anecdotes are certainly useful, although the anecdotes don't always seem to support the points that the author is trying to make. In any event, too much of this book is regurgitated from the trade press, without any value-added contribution from the author. The author may spend 2 or 3 pages ""summarizing"" an article from the trade press, which was only 2 or 3 pages long to begin with. This book is not nearly as good as one might wish, but it is ""consistent with reality,"" which is more than you can say for some e-commerce books."
4,A clear path for company to jump to E-commerce,"Everybody talks about the potential of E-commerce. E-profit shows how big the impact of this new business model. Many companies that want to jump to e-commerce world often lack of support from the top management. The author clearly shows how many experimental effort from the brave employee can transform almost the part of the company. So at every level implementation of the company that want to shift to e-commerce, this book give a clear model that easily be followed by every company. It also suggest the contingency model of top management support to launch e-commerce business. In short, this book is must have for every company that want to jump to e-commerce but unsure with path to follow..."
1,"Nice watch, but the bettery should have lasted longer","Bought this as a new item, within 3 months the battery is going dead.This will be the last Timex watch I ever buy!Just to many problems with Timex watches"
3,Great but...,"I like this watch's functionality and look, and this is my second or third one. But I've seen a disturbing pattern. Before my last expedition was ruined, it had started losing time in the analog hands. It was accurate for years before that. When I bought this one, it almost immediately began exhibiting the same symptoms, but worse, sometimes losing a few hours in a day. So I sent it in for repair (almost 2/3 of the cost of the watch in shipping and fees) and they fixed it (or replaced it?). Now it loses a few seconds here or there, but is good enough when you just need minute accuracy and think to check it against the digital readout every couple of weeks.I really like the analog/digital combo with two digital timezones (3 if you count the analog separately), the timer and stopwatch with lap/split, and alarm. I wish I could really trust the analog hands though."
3,Eroding is an issue,"Nice watch overall, but the eroding of the metal on the buttons is an issue, as others have noted. Weird and unfortunate way to reach end-of-life for a watch."
1,Not for bi-focal users,"I returned this item because I could not read the minature digital display. I am wearing newly adjusted bi-focals, so my vision is optimized. But the display is simply too small. Perhaps if it had been aligned properly in the miniature display window it would have been better. But even so, I'd say it is too small."
2,Too cheap,"It was great to use at first, especially trimming my puebes. Then it just started sporadically stopping. Go with a better brand for a few bucks more."
5,Trimmer,I purchased this for my man for a Birthday gift. He really enjoys using this product and no longer uses my trimmer.
2,I was so bad it brought tears to my eyes!,"I got it because unlike other personal mini trimmers this one seemed to get very good reviews. I must of got a sadistic version. I started using it and it ripped out a nose hair. I thought OK I must have trimmed too fast and the blades couldn't keep up so I slowed my pace a little and it did it again. I think there must be a gap inbetween the blades and the shaver also bogs down which can cause it. I started using my old one again.I finally found one that is perfect. I was in Best Buy which I normally avoid but they have this Remington personal trimmer model NE3560 in there that sort of looks like the Norelco Trimmer but with a more stout handle. It has a small angled head like the Norelco but with twin cutting blades and uses a AA battery instead of the normal AAA so it powerful, never bogs down. It is on the Best Buy web site. this is the best one I've used."
5,Live Rock-N-Roll at last!!!,"Not only do they deliver [...] kicking Rock, but they make it seem so effortless and fun as hell. If rock is your thing, then this is your live cd. With great songs from their 15 yr career and a few selected covers, the boys keep the spirit of real rock alive."
2,Very poor product,"Crystal Gayle and her choice of songs was great. BUT, the video quality was very poor, often very dark somewhat out of focus. The audio lip sync was way off, very noticable.. Audio sound quality very bad. In todays age of digital audio this was bad. My $29.95 table radio sounds superior. Actually I'm surprised Crystal Gayle's Management organization would allow such a poor product on the market. It just does not do justice to a great artist like Crystal.."
3,That the original cover of the show,Better watch the song list before buying this one its the Fifth different cover of the same show I encounter. The show is excellent all her songs are there plus pleasant surprises. On My copy the only complaint I could Make was the lack of sound. You`ll have to turn up the volume to the max to get some depth and sound. Her voice is beautiful and the 3 stars is too keep buyers aware of duplicating something you already have.So choose the one with the best price.
5,My First Five Years Baby Book,It is a great book to capture the precious first 5 years of a child's life. Love the different categories and space for pictures.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Anne Geddes My First Five Years edition with the baby laying atop a stack of towels for my first child and loved the layout, so when my second child came along I wanted a similar memory book. I found this one via the internet and purchased it thinking it would be very similar but with a different cover. I was disappointed to find the layout very plain and boring compared to all other editions I have seen. It wasn't very colorful and the text was small and plain. This just seemed like more of a advertisement of Anne Geddes photographs than a well put together memory book. Luckily, I was able to find an earlier edition of her book that I liked much better."
5,Great Value!!!!,I absolutely loved these knobs for the price. You can't beat them and their very tasteful!
2,Not worth the cost,It is light weight and works a little. It eats up batteries really fast and the lid falls off all the time. I stopped using it because after the 3rd time it got really dull and started ripping instead of shaving!
2,You should probably order another product.,"I'm sure there are other trimmers out there that are better. It's not terrible, it's just not very good."
2,Not the best,I was not sastisfied at all. I bought this to replace my old trimmer that had gone dull and sad to say that it works better than this brand new trimmer. It does not get a close shave and still left fuzz. Will be replacing it.
2,Somewhat uncomfortable,"Panasonic RP-HG17 Portable Headphones: Sound is ok, but very uncomfortable on my ears. Might be fine for others, but not mine."
2,puddle on the floor,"I had high expectations for this unit because so many people said it was the best. After it ran for a few hours I saw a puddle of water under it and spreading out across the floor and soaking the carpet. I changed the water, reset the unit in a shallow tray and tried again. Within hours the puddle of water that came out overflowed the tray. I shipped it back the next day and will not take a chance on another one."
2,Decent but flawed,"Well, it worked OK for about 2 days before it melted the water cap reservoir. Not sure how that affects operation, but not a sign of great engineering. It's not horribly noisy, but it sounds like your boiling water--loud enough that you're aware of it. I wouldn't purchase slant fin again given my experience with the gf200"
4,good product,"I love the quiet level of this humidifier. It does have a light humm, not like a table top fountain, and a little light gurgle but nothing that is obnoxious or would keep me awake. I prefer warm mist humidifiers because they are recomended for Asthma sufferers and for kids who get the croup alot. There is a variable humidity dial and I'll keep it low for night and high for when I'm sick. Low will last 2 days and high moisture lasts about 10 hours. I'm not thrilled about the little mineral pads but they do collect ALOT and I have Chicago city water. I will soak the base twice a year in vinegar and it cleans up beautifully! No need to heat the vinegar, besides it would end up as a vapor and stink up the room. The filling of the tank is on the bottom and can be a little cumbersom getting the seal just right and then flipping the tank over to return it to the base. But over all, I'm very happy with my humidifier and I've had it for 3 years now and I don't plan on replacing it any time soon."
1,Don't bother,"Buying this book only supports the worst examples of depravity that humanity has to offer. If you're interested in learning about child abuse, there are far better (and less sensational) ways to go about it. This book borders on social irresponsibility."
5,Grandmothers Garden,Grandmother's Garden is very beautifully illustrated and the short stories from Desmonds viewpoint are refreshing and enjoyable. I think Desmond has a gift for reaching a special audience of young readers. I look forward to his next book!
2,Stanley Hardware Hinge,Article was way too big for my project and I returned it at my expense. Other than that it was a very durable hinge for gates.
3,disappointing,"I am a big Jimmy Thackery fan, but this album is disappointing by his very high standards. His worst album by a long way. The best tracks on it are the ones he wrote, especially ""Blues Dog Prowl"" - worth the cost of the CD on its own.If you're new to Jimmy Thackery, don't start here - try ""Wild Night Out"" or ""Drive to Survive""."
1,So-so highly soy based recipes,Not very impressed. Nearly everything is loaded with soy products which are shown to cause problems with the body's ability to manufacture it's necessary hormones. I sold it at the neighborhood garage sale.
1,Stay AWAY!!!,"This cd is so bad, that it would make a wonderful gag gift for a Manilow fan. (Don't be offended if they throw it away immediately!)Various artist??? Sounds like the same person to me.It is quite humorous to listen to the translation of the lyrics. For example, from Let's Hang On - ""There ain't no good in us good-by'n, true love takes a lot of lying, Oh, I'm cry'n. ... You say your'e gonna go and call it quits - gonna check it all and break our love to bits.""There is a nice paragraph on the back cover that mentions Barry's career, but this alone is not reason enough to purchase the CD.So buyer beware - unless you really want to tease someone about Barry's music.Here At The Mayflower and Ultimate Maniloware better buys!"
1,NEVER BUY THIS CD!,"I don't know whose idea it was to have horrible lounge acts singing the best of Barry's songs...but it was a BAD one. And for the review that gave this CD 5 stars (??) it was Edgar John that did 'Could It Be Magic', not Elton John. The recording wash horrible, and not only has no one ever heard of these singers, they can't sing Manilow at all. Let's hope they do better singing their own music."
5,great for all ages,"This book is quite beautifully illustrated, and well written for all ages. It's a great introduction to Buddhism for kids or adults."
1,no star,It doesn't work. Does not even fit the usb cables. Do not waste your money on this junk and time.
3,"yes, but....","You know, I really wanted to like this book.... but, and perhaps this is beyond the pale given the novel's publishing history, it seemed to need an editor more than anything else, not for any of its themes, or subject matter, but for the prose itself: it's true that the language is often very evocative (and those moments are very good indeed--for example, when he describes the loneliness inherent in prison life), but more often it is clunky... not at all bad, but somewhat disappointing given the relative hype...."
4,COOL!,"I THINK THAT JUSTIN HAS REAL TALENT AND HAS A NICE CD, I THINKHE DOES A LOT BETTER WIHT SLOW SONGS THAN FAST SONGS, KELLY AND JUSTIN DID A VERY LOVELY DUET AT THE END OF THE CD AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE A COUPLE, THAT WOULD BE SO CUTE, BUT AS FAR AS THE CD I THINK IT IS AWESOME!! HE HAS A LOT IN STORE FOR HIM!"
5,Buy this album or you'll be SORRY,"No doubt my favorite song in the album is ""Sorry"". The beat just hooks you. I got hooked from seeing Justin perform this song on Oprah & American Juniors. I also really like ""I Saw Your Face"" (a very intimate song), ""Inner Child"" (a fun song), ""Doin' Things We're Not Supposed To"" (a nice dance song, kind of reminds me of O-Town's ""Take Me Under"" though), the new version of ""Get Here"" (much, much softer and completely different arrangement), and of course ""Timeless"" (you MUST go see ""From Justin To Kelly"" in addition to listening to this song. The visual of them on the boat goes with you all through this song.)"
3,A wasted talent,"Only a few songs worth replaying,""Sorry"",and ""Get There"".His voice would be better showcased if the writingwas a lot more mature."
1,the one star belongs to kelly,"This CD is just horrible. My friend is a Justin fan and begged me to listen to it, saying that after I finished I would surely buy the CD. That was definitely not the case. This CD just proved that Kelly Clarkson is the best singer. The last song on his CD was definitely the best, actually very very good, but only because Kelly sang. I would love to hear what Simon has to say about this. I suggest that everyone buy Kelly Clarkson's CD Thankful, it is worth your money."
1,NO MORE!!!!!!!!!,"I heard Justin's songs on American Idol and Oprah. From the very beginning, I was not impressed. Actually, I felt embarassed for him. Embarassed becaused his producers and writers did not present him well to the American public. His image didn't fit well with his music. Justin is no Frank Sinatra, but if I had to make my point, it would be like Frank Sinatra singing a song with hip-hop beats. I think Justin would be better suited as a jazz vocalist. He doesn't have what it takes to make on the R&B or Pop charts."
1,A piece of junk,"This has got to be one of the worst albums ever recorded. The dude is ugly, has a horrible hairdo and an even worse singing voice. For $, maybe (when you want to throw your money away in a sinkhole). I doubt he'll ever release another album, since his sales are non-existent. If you want soul, go for Teena Marie, Luther Vandross, Bryan McKnight...all this bozo needs is the red nose and he's all ready for the Clyde Beatty Circus...frankly, he scares me...it just proves that Hollywood isn't about talent...it's just about 15 minutes of fame stretched out to few months..."
3,"this isn't helpful, but that's not the point :P","I certainly hope he credited Brian McKnight for writing Condition of My Heart, and the Korean group Fly to the Sky for originally performing it.Or else I'll never by anything to do with him. Ever."
4,music lover from Rochester,I was pleasantly surprised at how good this CD is. It has a great R&B flavor to it & Justin sounds great on each song. There's a song written by Brian McKnight & one written by Justin Timberlake & Justin G. really makes them his own. Don't overlook this as just another CD that will appeal to teens or people who are into bubblegum pop. This will really appeal to anyone who enjoys good R&B flavored pop.
1,Don't waste your money,"Now I see why amazon didn't put up clips of this album; They actually wanted people to buy it.I liked the sound of Sorry (except when he squeals) so I thought that maybe the rest would be songs along that lines - fun, bubblegum pop.I was wrong. Justin tries his hand at latin and when that doesn't work he goes onto R&B; (unfortinately it's R&B; written for the soulfullness of a 10 year old) and then it's back to bubblegum pop but there isn't anything fun about Inner Child. Then he tries his best at Justin Timberlake kareoke with If you Wanna - a song that should have gone straight to a Kid Bopz type album.Where does Justin's voice fit in? I don't know, but they better figure it out before releasing his next album or there just might not be a next album."
2,"Inoffensive, bland elevator music","If you like bland, elevator type music, this might be for you. Soul and passion have been either ironed out or simply aren't there. Overly smooth and predictable. This is a music company trying to forcefully engineer success:bland and forgettable. If Kenny G could sing, and had less soul, this is what he'd sound like."
5,Amazing!,"Like many others, I have been anxiously awaiting Justin's debut album since the first moment I saw him on AI. I tuned in simply to check out ""the local kid"" and ended up a HUGE fan. This CD does not disappoint. I can honestly say that I own very few CD's that I will listen to all the way through, not skipping a single song...but this is one of them! I got it the day it was released and listed to it the whole way through, at least three times. Very mellow, very soulful...his voice just melts me. My young son favors ""Inner Child"" for its funky uptempo sound, while my favorite is the achingly good ""Condition of My Heart"". I also really enjoy ""I Saw Your Face"", ""Sorry"" and his cover of ""Unchained Melody"" - but I could list every song for that matter. After a hard day, all I need is Justin's CD and a glass of wine, and I am ready to chill."
5,Rave Review for A long-awaited CD,"I can't believe my CD finally arrived. I've listened to it almost continually since opening. Justin has certainly come into his own with this eclectic group of songs. I love ALL of them, especially Timeless, Sorry, and I Saw Your Face. I melt every time I hear them. My husband thinks I've lost my mind...if I have it was certainly worth it!!! I recommend this album to all ages, it has that kind of appeal. Young and old (like in my case)can feel the passion and feeling Justin brings to his music. The boy was born to perform."
4,"Hey baby, I'm so sorry things didn't work out","I purchased your CD and I thought it was very good. I do think you got the shaft from RCA. Best of luck to you! I just wish your fans were nicer. I'm a Clay fan and your fans are just plain horrible to Clay and his fans. I would never maliciously trash or tell lies and do sneaking underhanded things to another idol just to boost my favorite. They need to cut that out, it's tough enough out there being from AI without all the infighting. I will look for you to rise again, you seem like a talented, really nice guy."
4,Okay,"Voice is good and so is the variety of songs. Could be improved (needs more ""ooomph""), but its present state is still definitely better than Squeaky Idol's overrated flop CD that features nothing except all-squeaks renditions of I Believe, Summertime, and Chain of Fools."
3,A BEAUTIFUL DEBUT,Very relaxing to listen to if your interested in listening to someone who can really sing. To many recent artist can't. There is mabey a few songs the album could have done without but it's pretty good.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"I'm a ""Ranma 1/2' fan,and I like collecting the series.But this tape has 2 of the [worst] episodes ever.The tape focuses on nudity too much,and the shows really aren't that funny.I had wasted good money on this lousy tape.I thought I was getting something really good and funny,but I was VERY disappointed.Youare better off buying good tapes like ""Room with a Zoo"",etc.Just don't waste your money on ""Ranma and Juliet""."
1,Not recommended,"This publication is as much use as the box it came in, if Rudess wasn't famous this book wouldn't have been published, fact.There are much better FREE resources for keyboard and piano on the net , in particular forums. I was expecially insulted that a massive portion of the book was just an appendix of major and minor arpeggio and scale fingerings, easily and cheaply acquired elsewhere , obviously a lame attempt to fill space.The only aspect of the product I wouldn't dismiss as sub-par is the enclosed audio cd which cleans up the mess a little.I waited 2 months for delivery!Please research if considering."
1,Poor product and customer service,"My experience with Dell has been unsatisfactory in every way. I purchased this product a year ago; it was delivered with a faulty switch--a problem endemic to Dell computers.I returned the machine and exchanged it for a new one only to find that the second machine was also defective--besides for being a retrofitted device, not a new computer.Each time I called customer service, it took upwards of an hour, sometimes two. I would have to wait more than 45 minutes for a representative, before (usually) being switched to another department, and often, yet another.In the end, I returned the machine within the 15 day period allowed. But I lost hours and hours of my valuable time. I have determined never again to buy a Dell PC."
5,George Johnston's Two of a Trilogy,"This author is really worth reading for his exceptionally communicative passages in not only these two stories, but also My Brother Jack - the first of the Trilogy."
5,Great buy,"Its a Timex so it functioned without missing a beat while I was in Afghanistan, surviving a bomb blast. Easy to read, day or nite. Great watch."
4,An action-filled book with great characters and a good plot,"I have read all thirteen books of the Young Jedi Knights series, and this one ends one of the mini-series with a great climactic battle with galaxy-famed bounty hunters and a New Republic fleet! I recommend this book to any Star Wars fan!"
1,Crappy MP3 player,"I got my rio 800 about a half a year ago refurbished and it is the lamest piece of garbage i have set my eyes on. The rechargeable battery lasts for about 1 hour and i have even put my own 1.2 volt batteries in the backpack with more mAh but it only lasts about 15 minutes longer. the black trim is also falling off. DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER. If you have about 100 bucks to spend buy a mini disc player! I just got one and one minidisc for about 2 bucks has many times more memory that my rio. if you have 150 bucks then buy a 20 gig archos special edition.... anything above that get abetter ipod but in my opinion mini discs are the way to go, hardly any moving parts, group function, discs are cheap, and rewritable, i could go on forever but dont get an old rio product, if you are going to buy from rio and you dont need a bunch of storage, get one of their new players."
4,nice tv controller,i love this tv controller because i can watch tv and play games at the same time!! that is so coooolll. but it is a little heavier than a nomal controller.
4,Better than the standard filter,"This filter is better than the one that comes standard on my shop-vac, but it doesn't clean itself as easily as the description makes it seem. Shaking it does remove a ton, but you still have to scrape it a bit. Best bet may be to place the filter bag over it."
4,easy to install,"haven't used it yet, but was easy to install and I expect it to do the job - have fiberglass insulation to clean up."
3,Not bad at the first and middle part,But the end really make me disappointed and the other vampire and FBI Joel seem has nothing to do boring.
5,"Easy as 1, 2,.....","Plug one into the wireless router, plug the 2nd into a wall socket near where you want a connection and presto.....online access. SO EASY and works great!"
3,"Works, but set-up was not easy and there were limitations","Unlike the only other review of this product, I would not say that my experience was been as flawless. Despite having a Netgear router/wireless access point and Netgear PCI card for my ""distant"" PC, it took me hours to get this wireless range extender to work.The tech support finally helped me identify the problem and they were very patient, but I have to admit that it was frustrating and I felt like giving up several times.This booster cannot be installed in the most remote areas of your house. If the input from the bridge to the WGXB102 is a long distance, the IP address will not be recognized.I finally got it work by moving the WGXB102 closer and closer to the Ethernet bridge. This solved my considerable installation problems.That said, it does work. Just be aware that installation may not be as easy as implied in other reviews."
5,"Out of the Box, Plug In and Voila!","This product was easy to install, even though the instructions are skimpy (for instance there is no mention of the reset button). I can now get signal all around the apartment. Before it was difficult because my primary wireless router (Netgear MR814) was at one end of the apartment and, since all the walls are brick and mortar, the signal did not get very far. Only question in my mind is that the cases run very hot, and wonder as to the life of the product. I recommend it wholeheartedly"
2,Disappointing performance,"I bought this modulator to hook my new DVD player up to a 10-year old tv. It was $5 less than the regular modulator. There was a consistent buzz in the audio and an occassional green streak across the screen. I thought my television might be too old to handle the digital video, so ended up returning the DVD player. I decided to try a different player with the same modulator, but I had the same problems. Finally, I thought maybe a regular (not mini-) modulator might help. I got the regular $25 Terk modulator and my DVD player works perfectly with my television. This one might just be trying to stuff too much hardware in too little space."
1,Piece of Junk,"Bought this because it was cheap, but the video quality is poor and an awful humming noise drowns out the audio! I then bought a Philips RF Modulator for $16. The video and audio quality was superb! Do not buy the Terk mini modulator."
5,12 Years Later . . .,"I've had one of these for my DVD player and an ancient TV. It has worked perfectly all this time. Well, I took it apart recently and lost a part and can't figure out what it was. So I decided to get the same thing . . . until I read the reviews! I think maybe I'll try another brand this time. That's a shame if the quality has gone down that much. Oh, and it was a breeze to put on when I first got it."
2,pretty nice for smaller sized cats.,"i have 3 cats and my larger cat is just too big for it. he tries to use it but just ends up using it as a scratch post. so i knocked one star for that.my other two cats love it, they actually go inside the house and lay on the top. i have it infront of a window. i think it's bigger than it looks here in this picture.the bottom two platform or bed areas are pretty much useless. but that's ok.the carpet material is pretty cheap. not sure how long it will hold up, this is not the only cat tree i have... my other one at a similar price is nicer. so knock one star for that.it was simple to put together. I am a petite female and had zero problems and had it together in 15 minutes or so.I would recommend it to a friend.it's kinda nice that it's not so big, just really wish the materal was nicer.oh and the roof on the little house, it's smaaaalllll! so is the little house.***update****This house is falling apart after a month of use. Its a big piece of junk"
4,Kitty condo,"I have three cats so I needed something ""busy"", two are indoors only. They love it but it's mostly a sleeper. Because it has no carpet and only a thin fleece to cover it, they don't go crazy swinging from it like some of my other condos. The twine covered posts make it a scratcher in theory only; they much prefer real carpeting for the claws. The price was perfect and I found the diagram and kit easy to put together. Took me less than an hour and the cats were very involved in the process."
1,Red Skelton America's Clown Prince,I found this dvd very hard to understand. The voice quality is not good at all. This is full skits of his shows years ago. I like it when they show small bits and pieces of funny skits but this was the whole skit and they weren't that funny.
3,"These pens are good, the pack I got was not.","We use these pens for our business. They are very good at marking/writing on silver laser labels. We first found them a few months ago and have used them since. I decided to go on Amazon and buy a big pack (this pack).It has been no more than 4 weeks and all of these pens have been thrown away, they did not seem to have enough ink in them and became dried up quickly!All in all for 7 bucks I guess what is to complain about? Still, I would expect a full pen of ink when I order."
5,My favorite pens,"These markers write like a nice felt tip pen, and they don't smear! They are good for everything from making lists to writing notes to marking plastic containers or ziplock bags."
4,I Love this Book,"I am really enjoying using this book to learn about the history of knitting. If you like to know where some of the things you knit were derived, this is the book for you!"
4,A good ol' RHI/SyFy Channel movie,"For all my reviews visit my websiteI am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.I was falling asleep while I watched this so excuse me.The one thing different about this SyFy movie is that it has pretty good acting. It isn't all lame and emotional like others, instead it feels like Godzilla mixed with Commando. Godando? I like that, I'm gonna write a script called Godando. Of course, this isn't the best CGI, but it is better than the usual. Something that is kept like normal with the design for the good of mankind is the design itself, the actual picture of something like this if it weren't CG looks like a Bad@$$ worm right there.So there's my short thoughts. Enjoy.The Rating? 3.9/5"
3,sketch,"The instruction was good, if a little more advanced than one would expect on a 'beginning' DVD. The production quality was very disappointing. It looks like the instructer is in her backyard squinting into the sun the entire time. She is also sometimes hard to hear.The performance part of the DVD looked like a bunch of home videos put to some techno music... a lot of the performers used staffs instead of poi (cool... but not what the DVD advertises). The poi performances are uninspiring (the one exception is a video of ""Bassman"" who does some release skills and spins poi while walking on stilts).There aren't that many poi DVD's available, however, and if you want to learn, you can pull some useful information from this disc."
3,Just OK,Purchased this book because it was exceedingly inexpensive. The information it gives seems to be accurate but the organization of the book was confusing. I enjoyed it mostly because for less than $2 I got a hard back book that me and the kids could thumb through.
1,Disappointment,"My disappointment in the Jimmie Johnson Table lamp is overwhelming. Not only is it cheaply constructed, it arrived damaged. I have been trying to secure a RMA number and a paid-return-shipping label ever since it arrived a few days before Christmas 2006. The only favorable comment I have about the experience is that I have received a credit on my account.Please advise on return."
3,"Well, maybe not for craftsmen...","I returned this because I was trying to find projects to make in a metal artwork and welding class... this book had rather bland illustrations, and nothing which seemed readily reproducable in the context of the class I was taking...Matt Lang"
5,Hope it works,My mother n law wanted me to buy this for my grand daughter and this was given at the grand daughters 2nd birthday. We are hoping it helps with potty training.
4,Good book worth reading!,"This is truly a wonderful book about a patriotic, courageous athlete. Wrestling fan or not, this is a great book that was easy to read and very insightful. I knew of Kurt when he won the gold medal before he ever entered the world of Sports Entertainment and this book describes a lot about his life before the WWF."
3,Inspirational work which lacks an edge,"The story of Kurt Angle is best summed up in achieving a goal through hardship and against the odds. A nice story in itself with recounts from Kurt's childhood followed by the collegiate and Olympic success right up to the days of his much anticipated match with WWE's Brock Lesnar (at least this is the timeline of the paperback edition). But as far as sports or wrestling books go, this lacks the revelations, rough edge and charismatic humor which can be found for example in the works of Mick Foley -- to the point where the reader is left with a bland feeling and starts suspecting this is just a moderately well ghost-written piece of work to promote WWE. As far as Kurt Angle, the WWE wrestler, goes, this book doesn't live up to the high standards he is accustomed to display for us in the ring on a weekly basis."
3,Good until you get past the middle,"First off, full disclosure, I am not a fan of professional wrestling. I wrestled in high school and therefore found the beginning of the book where Angle describes his workout regime and olympic competitions very interesting. When Angle began writing about how he donned the costume for his professional wrestling career, he lost me as a reader. Maybe it was because the tenor of the book changed from the story of a man born of determination to that of a pompous, conceited actor. My suggestion is that if you are into wrestling qua sport, then read the first part and skip the second.-Dom"
4,"it's good, oh it's darn good","Kurt Angle tells his story in this book. The story is an interesting one. Angle participated in the Olympics and earned a gold medal in wrestling. He has gone on to a fine pro wrestling career with the WWE, although most of it has come after this book was published. Still, this is a pretty good book, certainly worth reading. No real WWE secrets are revealed, but it is a good inside look at Kurt Angle's life. Maybe someday, Angle will publish a sequel, which would contain the story of most of his success with the WWE."
3,The Brothers Warner,"I have always enjoyed going to the movies. In recent years my interest in learning more about movie making, knowing about the directors, and the history of the studios. Because I had seen the documentary on the TV, when I saw Amazon's price, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. If you are a movie buff, you will want to add this one to your collection."
2,Does not really work,"It felt nice the first time or two used but it did not after that.The were no visible differences from use, no sensation on application , and did not smell great or make you feel clean. Kind of disappointed with this one, I was not expecting it to work, but was hoping for ttheeffect or caffeine tingling more than 2 uses."
4,No buzz but smells great!,"I did not get any sort of caffeine buzz from this soap, but it leaves my skin feeling nice and tight and smells really good. I'd use it just for the tightening effect and the ""super awake"" scent."
5,"Arrived on time, as advertised","I actually haven't used the soap as soap because I bought it to analyze in lab. We were doing an experiment analyzing caffeine content, you see. So, its actually caffeinated according to my experiment, and it arrived on time for my assignment, which was perfect. Also, the peppermint smell is nice enough to actually convince me to eventually use it as soap. ^_^"
3,EH! Could go either way,This product works good. The only bad thing is that I dont like how it sits on the monitor of the computer. I had to get some fabric and stuff between the monitor and the camera because it doesn't sit too well on a flat screen. The camera is good the base sucked...should have had better design for flat monitors.
5,"Don't sell your time, sell value, key point in Million $$$","This is my bible for consulting and should be the bible for anyone else considering this field. As a publicist this has been the single most important book that has helped me establish my firm and charge the fees needed to succeed. One key point Alan makes is ""don't sell your time, sell value."" Not comprehending this fact dooms many people who try consulting and fail; they don't charge enough for their services. My copy is so beaten up the cover is about to come off. Why? Because I read it all the time! Furthermore, I have given this book as a gift to budding consultants so many times I've lost count. If you are a consultant now or want to be a consultant, read this book."
2,Not for anybody who's been consulting over 5 years.,"After 9 years of consulting, I found this book to be quite elementary.... ideas like ""redesigning your logo and printing letterhead on quality stock"" are strictly for the novice. This wasn't worth my time."
3,They work,"I will say that these work, but not for anything too heavy. Paper, notes, etc are fine but that is the maximum weight."
4,cool hand warm heart,"At times this artist slows down the tempo to Joplin's music.When he does he takes apart the music so you can explore all the nuance of this early Jazz form.I love that with some of these pizzazz filled tunes. That he covers a lot of territory and does it well is a very enjoyable artistic journey.Some of the pieces are sometimes too embellished for my taste, more Albright less Joplin.That may be part of the genre,who knows?After listening to this alum for a year,it has grown on me,so I have updated the review and given more stars."
5,"One Nil, One All, Whatever!","This release is just another in a long line of masterful performances by Neil. He has always been a songwriter for the ages and he doesn't disappoint on this one. ""Turn And Run"" is a beautiful, haunting ballad with interesting vocal content. ""The Climber"" reminds me of older Neil works with it's basic acoustic set up. ""Anytime"" will take the listener back to Woodface with it's gentle beat and harmony's. Finn may be mellowing but his singing/songwriting is definitely aging into a fine bouquet!"
4,"Great grip, good pick",Purchased a pack of 6 of these and gave three to a fellow guitarist. He has raved about them for the past month. The grip in particular allows for greater control when you play.
2,Don't Bother Me,"Evidently hashed together upon the death of George, to cash in on the uptick in interest, this short bio clipjob lacks interviews with anyone of any significance. It relies on a lot of speculation by the writer about what George ""must have thought"" etc etc. ""It's a good bet that..."" is one of his fave phrases. Still, this tells the extremely familiar story in telescoped form for anyone who doesn't already know it. I expected more."
1,the star is for the photographs!,this was undoubtedly one of the worst biographies i have ever read...and i have been walking this earth for a while. if george were still around i know what he would say....RUBBISH!do yourself a favour and pass this one by.
1,Just the facts..,"It seemed like a noble effort, but when the biographer loses track of his subject's age more than once, one tends to question the validity of other ""facts"" as well--especially when the usual ""credits"" for quotations and statements are lacking. We're never quite certain if a quote is from an honest, personal interview, or salvaged from some previously published work."
2,Good for an airplane ride,"This cursory Harrison biography was clearly cranked out in something of a hurry so that there would be more books on the shelf about Harrison following his recent, premature death. It contains the numerous factual errors and unsupported assumptions that so often plague books written by professional book-writers and journalists who have done some research but are not intimately familiar with the subject matter. We glide through Harrison's complex life at a brisk pace, stopping occasionally to note his generosity or his personal failures and struggles with fame. To its credit, the book is not especially tawdry, and takes some stabs at insight into Harrison's character, though again it would take a deeper Beatles scholar than this to succeed in any such endeavor."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"This is one of the worst Beatle books I've ever read.The inaccuracies are shameless.The writing is poor and spotted with grammatical errors.The vision is superficial and doesn't ad one bit to the Beatles story.It is incredible that there is not one good biography of George Harrison.Unfortunately I bought this without waiting for the Beatlefan review of the book. I could have saved the money.If you are a Hard Beatle fan looking for something new and fresh, I recommend buying Beatles Gear here..."
4,Intriguing,"I found 'The German Money' to be a fascinating exploration into the psyche of children born to survivors of the Holocaust.The author has created beleivable characters who are like people I might know with complex and contradictory personalities. The plot keeps you interested from the start, cleverly structured so that you keep wondering what the answer is to the 'big' question.This is the first of Lev Raphael's books I have read, and am sure to look for more! An enjoyable read."
3,Modern?,"This previously out of print set has Red with Charlie Parker for over half the first disc and the sound is not too good. Then you get to what you paid for, Red, Tal and Mingus. The tunes this combo recorded, live and in the studio, if left to one good take, could have been fit on one 80 minute disc. Instead what you get here is multiple takes of almost every song with the first take of each, strangely being the worst. Really for historical significance only. If you are a Tal Farlow fan, save your money and get the Mosaic box set. This was an incredible combo for a short period of time. It's a shame their legacy sounds like this."
1,Very disappointing,"Elderly couple bought this product (chrome-colored plastic) after she broke her hip. It quit working (water blocked, dial doesn't function) during her third shower."
2,Nasty stuff,"Played this joke on 4 friends at work. At the most, one friend said it gave him an upset stomach. No farting. Bad product. However, I will give it a 2 just because once everyone realized they ate fart candy, the laughs all around was worth the price of admission. Also, I heard it did not taste that good either. I told them it was imported root beer barrels from Australia. Hah!"
4,first time reading this author...,I really enjoyed this book. The book tells the story in present time and then goes back and mixes the past in to show what happened to Eve in her previous relationships to explain her current situation. Eve is a strong woman and it's interesting to see how she deal with her two sets of children and the men in her life.
2,Not for a gym bag!,"The headphones are of a great design, and the sound quality is good. They are NOT a durable set of headphones. I carry them in my gym bag, and after about a week, they broke where the black and silver meet. I bought another pair, because they are a really great design to work out with, they hug your head nicely while working out. They too broke after about a week. Good design, Bad materials."
5,a must read for all Christians,"While I would be biased, given that I am Catholic, I nonetheless recommend this book to all Christians, especially Catholics (and Eastern Rite Orthodox Catholics), who should know the Bible, but also those non-Catholic Christians who are open-minded enough to ask themselves these questions: given that I entrust so much to the Bible, as the written Word of God, how much do I know about the origins of the Bible? Shouldn't I know everything about its origins, if I am to defend my faith in Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior, *as he is taught to me* in the Bible? If the Bible was not widely available in print form until about 500 years ago, how did God reach out to humanity? How do I defend my faith against those who, through dubious scholarship, either add to the Bible or remove parts of it to suit their dubious doctrines?I repeat: this book is a must-read."
1,"Not worthless, but close....","This product is made of cheap plastic. The minumum amount of quality went into the construction of the dock necessary to make it sellable. Perhaps they were trying to keep cost down?The remote control does not work. It is, like another reviewer said, very cheap and flimsy. I can make a better one out of toilet paper, because then at least, it would serve another purpose once I realized it can not operate my iPod. It just doesn't do anything but turn the power of the dock on and off, which does what? I don't know.The cables that the dock came with are horrible. They are very lightweight, and the sound quality hisses and hums.This will be returned."
2,Doesn't operate all menu options,This unit didn't allow me to flip through videos or navigate back to the main menu. It only allowed advancing on the music side (not video). Remote was very cheap looking and flimsy. I returned this unit after having it for 15 minutes.
4,Presents itself like the novels of Peyton Place,"Unlawful Betrayal defines how your choices in life can seriously alter the lives of the very ones you call family. There is no room for misinterpretation with this book. It is obvious that if this family and town had performed these ""stunts"" in today's world, that the ""parents"" of this book or ""someone else"" would be going to jail for child endangerment or worse. I do hope this author continues to write all of the series, as I look forward to collecting everyone of her books. Who knows what's in the making here. Anyone who can muster up the courage to move on from something this out of control, and write about it, after all this family went through, may have more good literature up their sleeve."
4,What a nightmare!,"This is a fast paced story that is easy for a busy person to find the time to read. I enjoyed this book and look forward to the next in the series. It is a story that needed to be told. Unfortunately this is not an isolated situation, it is far too common in the world today."
2,Not too good of a movie but Great shots of the F-86,Yellow Airplane book reviews. This was not one of John Wayne's best movies but it had great shots of the F-86 Sabre Jets in action. There were also many shots of a unique T-33 along with rare shots of the B-29 loaded with the X-1 in its belley and a number of great shots of the X-1 in flight. The story was weak but had a good ending with John Wayne getting married. If you're into aviation history -- you'll love the flight scenes.C. Jeff Dyrek
1,BUYERS BEWARE!,This DVD is from the WBshop online where it is available for half the price. Resale of these archive DVDs is prohibited by Warner Brothers. Don't subsidize theft by paying twice the price for an illegal copy.
3,Previews unnecesary,Overpriced. A couple DVD's have annoying imperfections that cause the picture to jump or hang up. Previews take up space that could be used for more episodes per DVD.
2,Over Hyped,"I thought the pillow was just like any pollyfill pillow you would buy for $20 at Bed Bath and Beyond. Nothing special and not worth the $. Also, I thought it was too flat. I immediately switched back to my down pillows."
1,BUY A $5.00 PILLOW FROM WALMART INSTEAD!!,"This pillow is EXTREMELY overrated!! I have slept better on a cheap Walmart pillow. It did nothing for me or my husband after a week. The tag on the pillow itself says ""100% polyester fiber"" which is what is in your common $5.00 pillow. It does not say on the label ""50% holofiber and 50% super slick fiber"" as it advertises above. Its nothing more than a placebo and they hope you fall for it. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,For a restful night's sleep..,I have been buying expensive down pillows for years and have been disappointed at the inevitable flatness. This pillow gives sufficient lift without sacrificing softness. I have no idea if I am receiving more oxygen or not but I can say I am finally getting a peaceful nights' sleep...night after night after night... I can't rate these pillows highly enough. I purchased the matching mattress pad as well and the combination is unbeatable for comfort in my opinion.
4,2007 Spurs Championship DVD,"Overall, I give the 2007 DVD a B+ because it does have some good bonus features and the main featured video is excellent. Unlike past Spurs Championship DVD's, it DOES NOT have any ""clinching quarters"" from any playoff series. The 2003 DVD was awesome because it had the entire fourth quarter broadcast for each Spurs close out game for every round. Unfortunately, the 2007 DVD doesn't have this. However, the bonus features are plentiful and well done. The main video (featuring the recap of the season) is also very good. It is over an hour long. Sure, it does glaze over some key moments in the playoffs (mainly from the Utah series) but it does capture all the emotion of the season. If you're a Spurs fan, buy it. It's still a keeper."
2,Alarm 1 does not work always.,"Alarm 1 does not trigger on time. When it does not trigger on time, it triggers 5 minutes later usually."
5,I love this watch!,"I have had this same watch for almost a year and it keeps time perfectly, although I have not yet figured out all the things it does. Every time I see my almost 12-year-old grandson, he asks to wear my watch, so this is part of his Christmas gift. The only down side is that the velcro sometimes gets damp or hot but, after taking the watch off for awhile, it is just fine."
2,It's fun but bad camera angle makes it frustrating.,"PROS:- Cars with guns, mine layers, etc. So you can chase your enemy and shoot them to pieces at the same time.- 2 player mode.CONS:- Bad camera angle. You can only look forward and from behind. Can't look 360 degrees. Therefore many times you are shot to pieces but you can't find where your enemies are.After renting it for 7 days. I saved money by not buying it."
3,great shoes for long slender feet,"i love the style and versatility of these shoes, but they are narrow for my average-width feet, so they aren't as comfortable as they could be even though they are big enough. the proportions of the shoe aren't quite right for me; there is too much extra near the toes."
3,Ouch,"I wore for four hours last week and both of my heels are still sore! I'm hoping there is a way to break them in. I read that this is a common complaint (after I wore them, unfortunately). Hope I can find a cushion or something to put on the heel part."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased! What a waste of money! I thought this would be like a VH1 ""Behind The Music"", but instead this DVD looks like amateurs threw it together and put it up for sale -- I could have made a better DVD of Britney on my computer! Unless you want to waste your time and money, do yourself a favor, and don't buy this piece of crap."
5,A delightful ride...,"Shadow cared only for her comfort. She enjoyed wine, a fat purse and a handsome fellow. But she also got into a lot of trouble. It could be because she was a woman, or because she was an elf, but most of the time it was because she was a thief.So when everybody seems to wish her dead she is hard pressed to find the reason. Did she do something to upset them or are they just out to get her because of who she is?Either way, if she doesn't find out soon she'll be dead. And she enjoys life to much to allow that to happen!"
2,Entertaining.,This movie is hilarious. Sort of like Shaolin Chasity Kung fu. These 18 bronzegirl are guardians of the Temple & Must defend it at all cost. The funny part is that some of them are bronzeboys. & The gold paint looks like it's comming off on some of them. There is a part where they stand on each others shoulders and go around clanging people in the head with their heads. The sound effects sound like a Huge Liberty bell ringing whenever they hit someone. Funny stuff. No where near a classic but entertaining.
1,The Real Article!,"I've read this book a number of times, and it is STILL the very best book on spirituality that I have ever read. I have a Ph.D in mystical research, and I've read a ton of literature on this subject. Sri Yogananda was ""the real deal"" - absolutely authentic, throughout his life and even in death, his body is incorrupt (has never decayed). His crypt is at Forest Lawn Glendale, CA, and I checked it out with an old man who had been there in 1952 when Yogananda was laid out. This man attested to the incorruptibility - but it made him nervous and he didn't want to say much about it except that it was true. So if you want the real article, this is it, written complete with an extensive vocabulary that is almost never seen from contemporary writers. Five - no, TEN - stars for Yogananda!!"
5,Great read!,"A fascinating story of a man's spiritual quest. This book was hard for me to put down. Inspiring. The stories of other spiritual yogas were just amazing. I've found writings of these other people, such as people with stigmata or yogas that produce things out of thin air, so this book if nothing else has told me ""all things are possible""."
4,Allergy relief and prevention,"Subject matters detailed to educate readers possible cause of chemical sensitive from many substances,and detailed factors why particular dietary choices,could increase possible sensitives that are detrimental to immune system.Further more indentifies several substances used in everyday circumstances that could intiate physical and emotional strees.Prevented measures and avoiding consumer chemicals are possible when this book"
1,About as bad as Howard Stern . . .,"I did not like this reactionary diatribe at all. While some of Goad's points are well-taken, I don't find it helpful to be arguing about whether class trumps race. Goad seems to be filled with rage and hate. To end his book with the idea of enslaving white liberals says it all, I think: he's just as hungry for power as the next guy . . ."
3,Worth the time to read,"Mr. Goad has ground out a vicously funny book on the angst of the white underclass, an angst that has been largely ignored until now. He pulls out bits of history that will make you sit up and re-read again to see if you saw it right the first time (case in point: white endentured servants being SOLD in 1700's America). The major problem with the book is Goad's, for lack of a better word, whining that bubbles to the surface. Most of the problems he lists in the book that confronts him or people he knows could be solved if they'd shut up and work to solve them rather than turn to alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs."
3,Mediocre,"This book started out interesting as a diatribe against the while ruling liberal and conservative class. I agree that working class whites and blacks should bind with each other. The book lost me when it evolved into a self-help book. That last chapter ""How to Make Love to A Redneck"" was not something at all called for. I'm a Redneck woman, and I sure can't be gotten in the sack just because you promise me a ride on a Harley afterwards. Now maybe if you were to offer me a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon..."
5,Another timeless Christian Classic,Another Christian Classic that stands head and shoulders above most of the rest. This book is written so that you can read it for 5 minutes a day and be truly blessed. Thomas `a Kempis insight into the human condition is truly timeless. The spiritual condition of man in the 1400's was not different than today. Times may change but man remains the same.
1,Very Disapointed,"I was expecting something similar to RiskI and was totally disapointed, there are no map options as in the first installment. Though the Battle graphics are good, it slows down the game so much if you kept them on it would take forever to go through one round. I felt cheated out of a really good game. The lack of choice in maps I felt downgraded the game. I enjoyed playing the first, in large part because the map options changed the way the game was played. in closing save your money."
4,Love these wallets,"Always had a problem with too many plastic cards - store cards, membership cards. medical insurance cards for the kids and myself, credit cards, debit cards, rewards cards... these wallets solved the problem of ""how do I keep all of these organized once and for all.I tried many other solutions before I settled on these holders - The plastic sleeve accordions wore out and fell apart after several month - from the weight of the cards I guess.As long as you keep only one card in each slot, and do not expect this open wallet to hold money or receipts - you will find that it holds the cards securely, not too thick and feels nice to the touch. This is no ""high end item"" by any means - does not have a fancy logo on it and is not supple napa leather - but it is nice none the less."
2,Great till it came apart,"This thing is very nice to look at and feels great too. I thought it was great at least for the first few days. It is a little tight putting anything into but that is ok too as nothing is falling out. Unfortunately after only a very few days of use the liner starting coming apart and exposing all the individual credit card pockets. Guess it was too much to ask for, a great product at a great price. The price is right but spend a little more and get something that will last more than a week!"
3,"An average Transformer only - not good, not bad.","(...)After opening him, I feel he is worth what I paid for him - no more, no less. Paint applications on this figure are excellent; however, he has such a chunky torso (due to the disc-launcher action feature) and squat legs that he just doesn't look right in robot mode. If you pick him up, leave him in stingray mode."
4,Awesome If you're a true lover of Flakey Horror,"Great movie. Love Billy Zane in this part. One thing though, I first saw this Movie in French with English subtitles...It was awesome!!! Not as great in English but still a good watch if you love this sort of horror."
3,One funny zombie movie,The movie is great. Very funny! Billy Zane is great in it. My husband doesn't like these kinds of movies and he said that this was the best zombie movie we've ever made him watch :)
4,Ophelia's Winter,"This is definitely an original. Well written and empathetic toward the innocent. I've recently read a copy ""cat"" book...this original is much better. Susan Hill has heart. Keep writing Susan. It must be good for someone to ""copy"" it!"
1,Very Poor Print Quality,"Rather than bore you with the details, let me just say that only one of the cartridges in the 4-pack I ordered actually worked. The other three had illegible print quality. Be very careful with Rhinotek products."
1,There will always be an England...,"This ""ode to Britishness"" is about England of course, and a ""British"" (i.e. English) way of life the author probably saw at the cinema when he was a child - you know, back when all the pink bits on the map were ""forever England.""My gawd, even Baroness Thatcher is a culture crusher to this author.Queen Victoria is dead Peter! Get over it."
3,Sufficient but not terribly strong,"This product is in strange little squares, but they work well enough for posting light papers to the wall. When I tried to put up heavier posters, they fell down. I've found BlueTak to be better all around, although it's unfortunately more expensive!"
1,Be Aware,"Be aware that this dvd is the same that is listed as the Music Box Collection/Paul McCartney. The latter is an import. The only difference is the price charged. So if you want to buy this dvd, do not purchase the import."
3,GLAZE is the key word here!,"I have liked Essie brand for years & was looking for a new base coat. I did my research and after reading reviews, etc. decided to buy this as I was also in need of a new topcoat. When Essie uses the term 'glaze', they meant glaze!! As a base coat it is slick and I found it to be very runny. It is a better topcoat, IMO. I do like the clear shine it imparts on a clean, natural nail and am wearing it by itself as I type this. The drying time is pretty fast, which is a plus. I do wish it was a bit thicker/gripped nail polish better as a base coat, however. It really came down between this & CND Stickey basecoat, so I think I will try that or OPI natural nail base coat next time. Otherwise, I think I will keep using this as a topcoat / stand-alone clear coat for my nails."
3,Not Helge's best,"I was looking for a good source of info on prepping an 1150GS for long distance travel, and how to deal with basic maintenance and repairs. I have seen the GlobeRiders version of this on the F650GS and was hoping for some of the same.This video seems to have been produced earlier, and a lot of it was shot with a single camera on a tripod run by Helge. So far I have picked one or two things that I can now do, and did not know before. So that brings it to about $15.00 per tip. Worth it? Possibly!"
5,Excellent Product,"My cat keeps clawing these to pieces, but they are a great product, that I highly recommend. Feels like leather."
3,"Nice quality, sweaty wrists",Both the wrist and mouse pad seem to be of good quality - but my wrists sweat too much while using them.
2,sand paper,"I was expecting the paper to have a little more grit ? but maybe i was asking to much . normal when we use a belt sander it's to remove material, at least an 1/8 to 3/16 you would like some good grit on the belt to remove it as fast as possible . I would normaly have a 35 or 40 grit on the belt sander then take a palm sander or orbital sander to smooth it out . it would be nice to see portacable come out with something aggressive ."
4,nba ballers,"It's the ultimate off-the-hook game. Just look at my chain. later, you goin say, look at my bling bling. Then my ka-ching ka-ching."
1,This aint goin to be no good.........,"Really, do they really expect us to pay $50 for a game thats not worth $10?!? Its one on one for god sakes! WHo wants to pay the maximum amount of money for a game for a basketball game, when you cant even play real basketball. And who in the name of anyone came up with the idea to ball for cars and items!??! thats totally lame! Sure, it would be cool if it was real basketball with the extra one on one FEATURE. But when its just one on one without the real basketball feature, ouch, this isn't going to do very well:("
2,The Picture Lies,"I got this product and unlike the picture shows, the design was not etched in, instead it was the design painted on a kind of permanent sticker."
2,Bittersweet,"This phone has it all- the cool design, mp3, and it's a slider. Unfortunately, the touch key pads are extremely sensitive and can go off while you are using the phone. Also, to access the mp3 you need to install a special card of some sort. I'd say if you have the time to deal with such a complicated phone just because it looks good, then do it. But, if you're like me and you want a good quality phone with reasonable features, then check out the pantech c300. I love it!"
2,"klutzy, uncooperative phone","I bought into all the really cool ads on tv and the promised features. I researched and checked all my lists and ordered it for $149.99 with service. And YES!! it looks great! Then it starts. I call a bank to get a balance and need to put in all 16 digits of a card number. Maybe I'll get them all in and maybe I won't. Only the Chocolate knows for sure. It hiccups in the middle of my numbers and sends me to the contact menu. Very helpful. Getting out of the contact menu is no easy feat either.If you are your voicemail and try to delete or keep messages, good luck. Onve you have entered one of the numbers, you go to the contact list again.Once in awhile, the phone takes one to a different screen - I don't know the rhyme or reason. Very frustrating, loss of time, just plain a pain. If you have time, trade it in. I got a Razr which is approximately 1000 times better and easier to use. If you haven't bought it, don't.gppd ;icl"
3,Good and Bad,"Pros:- Looks Great.- Reception is fantastic (prior to what a previous reviewer said).- Volume, call clarity, and all the phone features work great. Including bluetooth.- MP3 player quality is quite good. And playing music is fairly easy.- Camera is pretty good and easy to use.Cons:- Getting your MP3s on the phone is a pain. Making playlists sucks, and its generally a serious pain.- Battery life is pretty poor. I charge about every other day (my previous phone I charged every 4-5 days generally).- The touch screen is really silly, and is an absolute fraud in comparison to the Ipod's touch screen.- Phone interface is very very bad (It is standard on all Verizon phones). It is non-intuitive, a pain to get the features you want to. ie it requires 5+ clicks to sync music to my computer.Overall, I got it to avoid buying an Ipod. It has fairly achieved my goal. I cant say I'm dissapoined, but its far from what I expected."
2,Its very sensitive.. even at the lowest setting!,"This phone is very touch sensitive even when I put it at the lowest setting. I apparently called my wife and left her a long 10 minute voicemail because the phone was in my pocket while driving to school. Also, its not too durable. My SD slot cover broke within the first 3 days I purchased it. If you want music, get an Ipod that will hold 30Gb instead of paying for the music kit for an extra $100."
2,Choco-doody,"As already mentioned, touchpads are nightmarishly bad. Phone has often needed hard-reboot or even battery removal to recover ""glitches"". Menu is arduous, tedious and non-intuitive. Function for hanging up or switching over calls was designed by monkeys. Phone makes ghost calls (called my friend with a new baby at 12:30a.m.!). Heat sensitive touchpads become non-functional and erratic in cold climates. Headphones with the music essentials kit won't stay in my ears, sound like doodoo, and eat the battery in a few hours. To set an alarm is one of the deepest functions in the menu tree. Limited to using the horrible robot ringtones or BUYING one from Verizon.other than that, the phone looks great!This will be my last LG product."
4,Inspiration..,"I ordered this book having no loom experience at all. I was not disappointed. I read it from cover to cover, went to the shop and built a simple loom and began. The illustrations and examples were great inspiration. I did not make the exact pieces from the book, but used them for the beginning of my own works."
4,"Al Kooper, Soul of a Man CD","The CD is excellent, and its condition is as stated in the advertisement. It arrived well ahead of schedule."
1,Nonsensical Posturing,"It is no surprise that Eisenman's biggest following is among impressionable students. Any thinking person can easily see through the quasi-rhetorical posturing that Eisenman is most well known for. His an architecture of words only, with little real concern for the pragmatics of existence, the quality of urban spaces or just about anything that constitutes a workable, livable environment. More basically, the images themselves are uninteresting as architecture. They owe more to the technology of the computer and what IT can do, to any understanding of how quality spaces are formed, used, inhabited or designed in any meaningful way. Eisenman is at best a fad, but if learning about architecture is important, try looking for a few books on the work of Kahn, Barragan, Scarpa, Lutyens, Aalto, among others.As they say, ""Those who can, - do. Those who can't, - talk (or write)"".Unless you are insecure and seeking to impress people with 2nd-rate theorizing, give this guy a miss."
3,psychedelic freak out 70's summer,"back when I read this, in 5th grade or so, it seemed like every book available was a creepy supernatural yarn like this about slightly abandoned children and odd things happening outside the adult world. This book blew my mind at the time; 30 or so years later I got it here on amazon used and found it mostly depressing and gloomy. But still freaky in that inimitable 70's way."
2,didn't receive what was pictured...,"When we originally looked at this item the only picture was of the hard case holder for the Game Boy sp with the car charger and head phones. We placed our order. We received a different set that had a magnifier, soft case, car charger and a grip thing. My son used the magnifier for a while but doesn't use the grip thing at all. He wanted the headphones. Right now on the site there is a picture of both items which makes it even more confusing for who ever decides to order this."
5,Fits perfectly if installed correctly,I installed this pocket in a Corolla 94 DX. It took me a while to figure out that the entire pocket must go BEHIND the dash (instead of inserting it through the hole) and be supported by the original frame. Am happy with how it looks.
5,Fits 1996 Camry LE,Ordered this item from amazon together w/ a JVC KD-HD60R radio receiver and it perfectly fits my 96 camry LE 2-din dash using the stock brackets and screws. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Worst sort of imported junk I have seen,"I am appalled that this ""safe"" is on the market. It is shipped in a cardboard box without the thinnest shred of protective packaging. The thin paint does not even cover the file marks or other signs of poor workmanship. When closed the door leaves a large enough gap to insert a pretty good sized pry bar. While the door pins are pretty substantial, the mechanism controlling them is a disaster. The key lock is easily compromised, and I suspect the locking mechanism could be compromised with a decent sized pair of channel locks. Oh, the electronic lock? It doesn't work. It won't set properly and when it does it forgets your PIN after a few uses. Pure junk!! What's worse, with what it costs to ship this thing, it's cheaper to throw it in the garbage and eat it all than to return it. Could not be more displeased."
3,damaged when received,"When I received the safe, the bottom front was scratched and the pain worn off, however, I needed a safe asap, so I did not return it, because it achieved the purpose I needed right away. I did not have time to return it, wait for another, etc. I think the seller should give me some sort of credit."
3,digital electronic safe,"the safe was a great addition to my house and safe sence of security to our valuable items. I really liked the great price and fast delivery.thanks,Guillermo Arias"
3,It's a beast!,"We've owned this ladder for about 8 years. We purchased it when we bought our first home, thinking it would be handy to have one ladder that could function in many ways. It does exactly what they say it will do. It is sturdy. That being said-it is extremely cumbersome and very, very heavy. We had not considered when we bought it that my soldier husband's schedule would necessitate my need to use this beastly ladder all on my own. I am no slouch but I have trouble even getting this thing in the house, much less trying to get it opened up and vertical. We now own this ladder, a 2 step ladder, a 4 step ladder and a 6' fiberglass ladder - this one is usually buried somehere in the garage..."
3,"OK for Mani, but not Pedi Ready","In my humble opinion, I would skip these. I read about these on a beauty blog, Beauty Buffet, I think. After a cgood review for a well-known nail tech (although I think she used the Milk & Honey), I decided I would pick them up for my at home spa manicures. I'm so not impressed. Although I do like the concept, these are tiny, about the size of a marble so you need a few for a manicure and about 15 for a nice pedicure. The fragrance is clean, nothing spectacular and rather bland. I think there are much better options out there. However, one thing these do have going for them is the fact that they are not at all oily. Other than that, nothing fab."
1,Absolute trash,"I can't believe the reviews I'm seeing. This novel reads like it was written by a Dungeons and Dragons geek who is embarrassed to be be writing fantasy (because he won't be considered a ""real"" writer) so he tries to make it more ""mature"" by adding lots of profanity, contemporary themes, and endless heaps of senseless violence. I really thought I'd be in for a treat after all the hype I read, but by page 50 I found myself disgusted and bored. Hey, Mr. Stover: ultra violence and curse words do not mature reading make, and, contrary to your inflated opinion of yourself, this book is part of the reason why today's fantasy market is glutted with such trash. This book is an utter bore best suited to adolescent males eager to idolize the silly, tough guy protagonists you enjoy creating.In all, yet another reason why I am embarrassed to be seen reading fantasy."
3,Nice album..def worth buying,"This ain't a bad album from dipset. I was reluctant when I first bought this, but it was well worth the used price I paid for. The beats are nice and the lyrics are aight. It's nothing ground-breaking, just a good listen."
4,Great for Home Office!,"I found this machine to be easy to set up, more than adequate functionally. It contained all the features I was looking for and has helped me immensely with job searches. Managers are always impressed when I tell them, ""I can fax my resume right over..."" The price and functions were just what I was seeking. If you want a corporate quality, reliable fax machine in a small home office unit, this be the one!"
4,I just bought this and hope I did'nt make a mistake.,I have had no problems with this machine so far. I've only recieved two faxes with no trouble. Some of the reviews I've read about other Panasonic fax machines are'nt very encouraging. I wish I had read them before I bought my model KXFP151. I guess I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best.
3,Bad editing job,"The book I received is not the original 4th edition but a reprinted one with a fax quality. This damages the use of this really good reference in probability (you will find a rigorous proof for all theorems in probability), since some passages are hardly readable with this bad printing quality. However at a price under US$25 -the price I paid- this is a bargain !"
1,Absolute waste,If I could give this product 'zero stars' I would. We have always used coppertone sport with outstanding results in the past but thought we'd give this product a try. We did everything right....applied 30 minutes before exposure and reapplied every 30 minutes while we were in the pool. All five of us now have sunburns.
2,Sick of Bratz,"I purchased the Bratz Diamonds CDrom game for our 5 year old daughter but instead received the Bratz Diamonds PS2 game. We kept it, regretably. Our daughter plays this game but has some difficulty. We limit her use of PS2 so it may be that she is not playing it long enough to figure out. Her experience with PS2 games is also limited due to her age. All in all, I would not recommend this game for anyone at any age. It is just dumb."
3,Hard to reccomend,"This game was really exciting but there is no realism, you have poor cut scenes, the campaign hardly resembles the movie, the cars all act quite similar, from the supercar to the truck, the stunt courses are extremely difficult, the racing has quite a number of bugs in it. But still this was one of the first games i owned and i loved it the excitement was great and my mum and dad even joined in. Its old now but i really feel like promoting it. If your a hardcore gamer you'll find too much wrong with this game to enjoy it, i had fun with it anyway."
3,moms moms,"dear amazonei have bought the book mentioned above,textbook of physical diagnosis, but i have been surprised that i have to pay 300 danish kroner(50 DOLLAS) to get the book from post as moms.because it sent from USA and not from UK.therefor i did not recive the book and i would like to cancel the buy.next time when i buy any thing from amazone, i would like to get it from EU COUNTRY TO AVOID THE ............ MOMS.BEST REGARDSMOHAMMED ALBAYATIAMAZONE COUSTOMER"
1,Lasted two months,"I've had Seagate drives in the past and have been happy with them. I used my 300GB ATA in a removable drive container. I removed it a couple of times and noticed it got VERY hot very quickly. I suspect this may have had something to do with it. I doubt it was the enclosure I had it in because I've had MANY drives in it in the past and it is still functioning for other drives I have. Now I'm looking for two new hard drives, one to replace the one that failed and the other as a backup. Too bad I didn't keep my receipt or box for this drive."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought the label maker against several reviews I saw here, and I'm coming to regret it. The label maker worked for about twenty labels, and then broke. I think part of the problem is the tape used; when cutting, a lot of times the protective sheet on the back comes off, and a small section of the sticky plastic part stays behind, jamming up the label. I've tried picking out the bits, and it still doesn't punch. Like several other reviews stated, you get what you pay for."
1,PATHETIC & unnacceptable results.,"I am sad to report that this product is pathetic. I was so excited about the prospect of it, but now I don't feel it's even worth a refund: it's simply made to break!!In my experience I have had no success after trying to make a 6-letter word, eight times now. some letters only half print, sometimes there are unintentional gaps almost the size of a space bar! Ive tried reloading the tape, no luck. I treid different intensities of handle pressure, no luck. I forfeit, the handle is about to disintegrate in my hand. the stickiness is PATHETIC, FULLSTOP.I have had a pretty good run with Amazon up until this point, in fact I'm a loyal customer. The company should be clever and not sell makeshift items. This product represents is a disposable product culture I refuse to fooled by any longer:let this message be heard far and wide."
2,Make sure you read ALL the reviews!,"I purchased this Dymo label maker hoping to get one to match some old school labels I have on my tool box. This label embosser works well enough, but the typeface is not like the old models, not to mention it is all plastic. I should have read all the reviews and looked at all the images because another reviewer pointed this out and I could have saved me the time and money. The picture from Amazon shows the old model typeface coming out of the label maker, but that is not what you get. I just purchased an old one off of eBay and it works great. It is metal so it lasted and will last a lot longer. If you looking for and old school Dymo label maker go to eBay, there are plenty, otherwise it is just OK."
5,Old Fashioned Is Better,"These mechanical Dymo markers are much more convenient than the fancy new computer types. They work for years and years, never need batteries or a socket, and the labels seem to hold up to abuse better."
3,William James anthology,"The binding and paper are extraordinary, if that's what you're asking. It's a finely assembled volume. As to William James, 95% of what he writes is gibberish, but others may well not view it that way. I'm immensely admiring of his right brained brother Henry, and have read him widely, but William is another animal, left brained, but full (in my opinion) of crackpot medical, psychological and philosophical pronouncements. Heretofore I'd heard much about him, and read only fragments of his work. I think too that William survives for his being a member of the illustrious and paripatetic James family of old Boston. Decide for yourself."
5,Classic,"After all these years, it's still so good! I love this movie so much. I recommended to everyone who likes moving movies."
1,"Great movie, but it only works on TVs and VCRs made in England.","It is one of the best movies I have ever seen, but I would recommend getting it at Best Buy because when I got it here the movie wouldn't work on my TV."
3,Not permanent,"I love everything about this product, except that many of the things I have glued with it have come unglued days or weeks later."
2,hmmm..,"I would probably not buy this if I were you. I agree with the review before me, it was only challenging in the couple of end challenges and even then only a moderate challenge. Also it was very short and I beat it in a couple of hours. The graphics are not the best either. I got this game for christmas and wished I had not, and gotten something better like animal crossing or nintendogs. Please save your money and do not buy this game. Maybe get the Winx Club game if you are a fan..."
5,very good book to read because it is true to life,It seems to me that if you are good in managing your life it will carry the idea to be good managers in the company. I think that it is very true.
4,A Detailed Jim Morrison,"The authors do take some artist license in the opening chapter, but beyond that, the accounts about Jim's personality are enough to make you melt. It traces from Jim's childhood to his unfortunate, and as the authors mention, possibly mysterious death. All in all, this biography is thorough."
3,Table Fan On The Wall,"Don't confuse this with the kind you experience in waiting-rooms and such. This fan is weak. About as strong as a table fan, costing ten bucks or so. If that was the case, then it would be good enough to get 4 stars, maybe even 5. But That's not the case. This thing is way more expensive than the quality merits. At this price, all you're getting extra is the remote (not because you want it, but because you need it to make it work), and the ability to mount it on a wall. For my needs, the wall-mounting was important, so I gave it the 3rd star, otherwise it deserved only 2 on a price/performance ratio.If you are a member at Costco, it's 3/4 of this price over there."
4,good fan,I like the remote control but it isn't as quiet as I hoped it would be. Still a very good fan. I thought the price was a bit steep.
5,Where has she been all my life??,"I've been waiting for a jazz artist that talks to me with the music and lyrics. What a awesome combination of the two on ""Move a Mountian"". From the emotional knowing that ""You're there for Me"" to the strong goodbye message in ""One Day Before Long"" - this disk brings out an incredible range of emotion in an all too short listen. Don't miss track nine - by far my favorite - feel the emotion build and enjoy the incredible musical talent behind the sensuous and intense voice of Dallas. I highly recommend this disk and hopefully we'll see some live shows soon!"
4,BEST RPG EVER!!,"Okay,i first picked this up and thought it wasnt to great.But i played more into and found out more about the world of Vvardenfall.Okay like any other RPG you create your character,but what Morrowind has different isA) The World is more massive than any other gameB) There is something for everyone.Like say you wanna be an assasin,then join the Morag Tong,or you wanna be a theif then join the thieves guild.c)Theres soo much to collect and to explore it will leave you speechlessPros:Big MapLotta Stuff to CollectLotta stuff to do in generalLots to exploreDifferent Weapons to use so you can be the master archer,or marksmanDifferent species to choose from when making your characterCons:Graphics arent modern day Xbox,you must keep in mind that the game is from 2001.Freezes frequentlyFIle corruption occurs every once in awhileNo Voice OversOnce somebody is killed,they never come back"
1,why in the hell did i buy this game again??,"Oh wait, I remember I thought it might be fun this time. I was wrong this game is still crap!"
2,One of the worst games ever!,"When I first bought this game, I thought it would be awesome. So I spent 20 dollars on one of the worst games ive ever played. The world that you are in is huge and easy to get lost in, but there is a big variety of things that you can do. You can kill store owners and steal all of there stuff, but if you take too much you wont be able to move. Overall rating 1.5 stars."
5,Great Product for Guinea Pigs,I purchased this product to help with a sick Guinea Pig. Guinea Pigs need extra vitamin C to remain healthy. The vet thought my pig was so sick and would not live. After giving this to him for three weeks he was like new.
5,Best since season 3,"This, like DVD season 3, is probably one of the best seasons of the shows history. Infact there are a lot of plot parallels between this and season 3. I won't do a spoiler here, but you'll see when you watch it. This is JR at his best, and if you somehow missed it in the first six seasons, you'll really see why he was the star of the show. This was also, I beleive, one of the last seasons to have the entire original cast in it. B.B.G. was missing in season 8, Patric Duffy from Season 9, and Charlene Tilton from Season 10, maybe she was gone in season 9 also.So enjoy the last full season, post Jim Davis with all these characters.The special features are kind of week for this season. Couldn't they include the movie Dallas the early years with one of these DVD releases."
5,Dallas----love it,"I am a great fan of Dallas. I LOVE IT The cast, the crew, the writers & the creaters are all terrific & talented people. thank you very much."
3,Dallas The Complete 7th Series,"JR as a nice guy? This is the season when JR almost appears like a decent fellow (for a lot of the series).If you are a Dallas fan, no review can change your ideas on purchasing all the series up to the (as yet unreleased) 9th Series (The Dream Series). At Series 9 you may consider skipping the series until Series 10 is released....but that is up to you!If you are not a Dallas fan, then start at Series 1, and work your way up! You will never regret looking at life Ewing style."
3,Popular but difficult to use,"Nearly every CS or ECE department is US uses this as their textbook, because the authors are the most experienced researcher in this field. The book has plenty of descriptions but it lacks examples and explanations. What's more, you can never understand accurately what the authors mean in the exercises. They just assume that you know everything about the background knowledge. This semester we spent most of the time to clarify the doubts about the exercises in this course. So I suggest to use another book if you can."
1,couldnt even play it,well i would rate this with 0 stars as this game did not work at all. it would start up and freeze before the opening even started. not happy at all._
2,don't fit my camera,well I guess I should have known. Even though it says it fits most cameras it don't fit my fuji or my wife or my phones. so far can't get it to fit anything. oh well
1,Good if all you want to do is transfer photos...,"This is a cheap cable, which only performs cheaply. It will not power any device nor charge it. I have tried it with many different devices, connected to many different USB and power sources. It will transfer data however, but only if your device has it's own external power. Bear in mind though, that that is even iffy. I used this on a WD external hard drive, and whenever I did data transfers that were larger than 2 GBs or included more than 30-ish files, the cable wouldn't work and my hard drive would ""eject"" from my computer.If all you need this cable to do is transfer a few files quickly and without power, feel free to go for it. Otherwise, look for something else."
3,The band shown is not what you get!,"I ordered three of these watches. One for myself, and one for two of my sons. I was pretty disappointed when the watch arrived and I saw the band. The band that came with the watch looks cheap and plastic, not at all resembling the suede-like one shown. I contacted Amazon, and they offered to send new watches, but I told them that I would just wind up getting the same cheap bands again. The guy didn't seem to understand that the product number was correct, but that the issue was not getting what you see. They finally offered a ten dollar credit per watch. At least I can buy decent replacemnt bands now, but I am disappointed that this happened. I'll try and upload images of what I got so potential buyers can compare it to what is advertised."
3,Not bad!,"This has been a good watch for me. I ve owned it about a year and it has taken a good beating and survived.The features (timer, chronograph, compass, and alarm) are easy to use once you learn how.On the downside the strap has detached a couple of times and I have nearly lost my watch. The compass needs perdoic calibration (which is easy) but I would not think of hiking cross country with this compass."
2,A Little Disapointed,"A bought this watch for the good Timex brand. It has the features I need all up front ""but"" seeing that I never take my watch off, I know the 1/2 leather band will soon start to smell and the only other thing that I'm upset about is one feature that I highly depend on is the light. It doesn't work untill you press and hold for 3 seconds, this you must do twice a day and then the light is not very bright at all! And when your pressing the front button to activate the light your finger blocks the view of the time!"
3,"Nice Watch, poor compass","I liked the watch, but found that the compass only worked for the first day or two. After that it only seems to show an easterly direction. I nearly got lost in the woods, assuming that it was registering the proper direction.I'm sending it back for work. If it comes back repaired, I'll be happy to use it. Until then, I can't give it a good recommendation."
1,Did not work,This did not work with the new MS system. I still play the original games but this will not work.
5,WONDERFUL,I've used this since getting it in December. Before that I only used a perculator. This is a fabulous item and it makes amazing coffee and caps.
2,A Pain to use,After only one month the machine gets clogged and overflows.They blame it on the coffee grind (too fine)and of course us not being able to lock it down properly etc.Fact is that for $300.00 it works little better than my old $29.99 machine. It does have more features but they only cause more problems. I have wasted more coffee trying to get this thing to work right that I could have bought another machine.Have Fun !
3,2 yr old. Died today. RIP.,"Convenient design and easy to use. Coffee temperature unpredictable and often less than hot. Great crema and wonderful taste when temperature right. Stopped working today, almost exactly 2 years since I purchased it. Liked it but not enough to pay the minimum $80 that Capresso asks for out-of-warranty repairs and not impressed enough by the durability to replace it with identical model."
5,Loved It! Fabulous Book! It's insightful and humorous.,"At first I thought it would be a quick read. When I started reading this book, I found I could not put it down. You find youself going back and rereading the entire book and then different chapters that focus on dating (""Chapter 1: Fixing the fatal flaw that's ruining your love life"" was incredibly insightful), style, avoiding guys like your Dad (a big one for me), and a lot more. It is really so supportive of women. I loved that. It felt like hearing your best friend talk to you. I don't have gay guy friends like a lot of my girlfriends do, so it was especially cool for me. He really does have a take on male/female relationships that I didn't consider or ever hear from anyone."
4,Remake?,"Lot's of action in what has to be a remake of The Quick and the Dead. It has got the Priest, the kid, the girl and the grizzly old man. Ok, it has the modern day twist, but still everyone must die except for one. Maybe."
2,A Better One Elsewhere,"If you wnat to throw some money away and scratch you head afterwards and watch it again buy Pistol Opera by 78-year old director Seijun Suzuki.Read the rest on AZ - only got 3 stars.But, if you're a fan of Suzuki or not - a better ideaSome questionable nudity if you're of the religious sortGood violence if you're the religious sort."
5,Great value,Great value for the price. This is our second one of this brand of watch. Especially good for children with small arms/wrists. Easy enough for kids to put on by themselves due to the velcro closure. Would buy again!
5,Pretty Cool....,"My 10 year old loves this watch. It's been ticking good so far; Timex is pretty reliable. INEXPENSIVE, but reliable. Can't complain one bit."
2,Looks great - and fun,"This is a Christmas gift for my young grandson...so performance not yet determined. However, by appearance and ease of operation for his skill level, it's neat. Hopefully performance will be the same!"
1,Dont Buy Waste of Money,It broke in two days. Its surpose to be a kids watch but doesnt hold up when a kids wearing it and playing.
5,From the back cover:,"A delightful children's Christmas fantasy! Mr. and Mrs. S. carefully chronicle the adventures of the ""Little Folk"" in the Far North Countree.Annette Selleck shares the unique stories she told her children every Christmas as they were growing up. Illustrated by artist Wayne Lohr, Chronicles parallels the imagination of 'The Hobbit' while maintaining a distinctly festive Holiday theme. To be enjoyed by young and old alike.""Many years ago, in what seems like a far away time to me, I began to write the letters and tales that are to be found in this volume.They were written because I wanted to make Christmas Day more meaningful for my Beloved Family...So Dear Friend, whoever you may be or wherever you are, if you hold this book in your hand and read it, please know that you are one of my Dear Beloved Family. You are welcome to open the door and stop across the threshold into the Land of Make Believe; The Land of Cubbit, and all it Little Folk. - Annette Selleck"""
2,What about us southpaws?,"I've never purchased one of these, but I saw one in a classroom, and it looks like it's for right-handed people only. True?"
4,Last Raven for PS2,"This game continues on with the Armored Core series very well in many aspects. It carries on the tradition of extreme mech customization, great fights, and lots of ways to play through it. It varies from some of the others in the sense that it has multiple endings based on the way you play through it. I definitely dont recommend buying this if youre new to the series; however, if youre a pro and veteran AC pilot, its a great buy. Along the same lines, it can also be very difficult if you do not have Armored Core Nexus because of the rapid progression in difficulty (making your AC building hard to keep up with the difficulty of the game). Overall, a great buy for AC veterans, but can be VERY difficult if new to the game or if you lack Nexus."
2,Weird game,"This game was not what I expected. It's kind of weird..You don't control pac man and he just goes thru the same scenes over and over. We played it a couple of time, couldn't really figure it out, so switched over and played frogger instead. Eventually we will play it again and try to figure it out, but so far this game gets 1 star."
5,A must for every climber in Washington!,"This guide thoroughly describes several climbs in the cascades of Washington, ranging from simple walk-ups to technical rock climbs. It gives detailed information on the best climbs. I have used it extensively on numerous climbs and find it informative, current, easy to read, and very helpful. The maps and pictures with routes are especially helpful. Almost every major climb in the North Cascades is covered and the history section preceding the description of each climb is very interesting. This is a great book and a must for any mountaineer in Washington, whether they be a beginner or a seasoned climber."
3,Good product,"Similar design to the one I used to use. I like the front clear cover (if you want to see the first page of your report before opening; if not, you need to choose the one with the solid-color front). Overall, this is a good product I can recommend."
1,not worth it,"this product sucks. it makes me break out and it burns and stings as you clean it off. i thought maybe if i used it a few times i'd get used to it, but it just got worse every time. it's a big waste of money."
5,Great workout!,"I borrowed this from a friend to start slimming my abs, and loved the workout so much, I bought my own copy!"
2,Okay,I thought this dvd was okay. I prefer the style of Jillian Michaels. I like to get in and get it done.
5,GREAT workout!,"This DVD is a lot of fun and definitely gives you a workout. It's motivating, and paces you by alternating between upper body, lower body, and cardio. Be sure to buy 2 hand weights (at least 2 lbs.) to have to go along with it!"
5,Goo Goo Dolls are the best!,"After I heard ""Name"" back in 1995, I became a huge fan of the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I heard that they have a concert DVD with all their hits, I got to have it. So I bought it. It is the best concert DVD, for a huge fan like me or for people who just heard of them. The only song that I like that is missing from the DVD is Ain't It Unusual."
4,nifty,"The shuffle is cool. The only thing is that it has a nice clip, but my gym clothes don't have anywhere to clip it too. So I put it in my pocket. Where it is hard to skip songs, change volume etc/.I haven't figured out yet how to manually add music, so that is an issue. But the extremely small size of this makes it a lot of fun. I really like it."
1,NEVER BUY iPOD PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON!!!!!,this is the SECOND time i've bought an iPod from Amazon and the SECOND time it broke within a few months. guess i should've learned the first time. NEVER buy an iPod from Amazon! go to the Apple store.
5,Razima rocks with iPod shuffle!!!,Sync sucks! And all other features rock!! It could be great if it had a display. Amazon's ship reached the shore on time.
5,I love this thing!,It is so easy to download your own music and where the controls are located is easy to use while running. I just love it! It's so lightweight it's incredible!
4,A very good tool,This book enabled me to reach new levels for my own abilities and have used it as a reference guide many times. For a beginner it is a valuable tool. It came highly recommend by a mentor of mine and she did not lead me astray.
2,Mediocre Mermaids,"The Mermaid's Ball is a somewhat likeable storybook that both of my children enjoyed hearing a few times. It tells the readers about the preparations the mermaids make for the ball that evening, all of which pertain to their appearance. The illustrations are average, so don't add much to the story, and the plot is nonexistent. It won't be a classic in our home, but the tattoos have been pretty fun."
4,Great for toddlers,The simple text and ideas launch the toddler girl's imagination. My 2.5 year old asks for it most everynight.
1,It Never Worked,"I sent for this just before a trip, thinking it would be great to have. It never worked. I got a ""memory card error"". I was forced to go to a local camera shop and buy a similar card made by Panasonic for $99. I am returning this; will not try SanDisk again."
5,Great Converter,"It is a very reliable converter. Converts 110v and 220v, and runs quiet and stays cool. Circuit breaker on it is a great safety feature."
3,A good read for your spare time,"First half, very interesting. The second half is like a rag to riches story."
1,A poorly written book of self-centered attention,"Anyone who reads this book can tell Joanie's a self-centered, egotistical brat. Just count the number of ""I""s and ""me""s throughout the book. It's OK to be bitter, but you've got to express it in a way that doesn't sound egomaniacal. Her book is completely incoherent- jumps around from one thing to the next without getting much at the real picture of her wrestling career. Sorry, but I don't miss Joanie (formerly known as Chyna) at all."
3,Not impressed,"I had version 3.5c prior to this one and did not have any problems with it. Now that I have the 5.0 Platinum edition I don't seem to be able to perform a two drive copy. I always have to save the CD to my hard drive first. I have ruined 4 CD-R's trying to get it to work. There are no new drivers or firmware available for either of my drives and the previous Easy CD Creator version seemed to work fine. Although Roxio answered all my e-mails promptly, I still have not been able to get the new version fixed. I think they have a form letter that they send to everyone who complains of having problems. They should get the problems fixed and send out a fix disk to all the people that bought and registered Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum. The program over all is easy to use if you can ignore/work around the problems. As a rule software manufacturers can not test the software on every configuration or type of computer. This is what the customer is for."
1,bugs bugs bugs,This product has so many annoying bugs that using it is an effort.One peculiar problem that stopped me from using this package is that this sw keeps on ejecting a blank RW saying the disk doesnt have enough space. This happens when you erase a CD and try to use it.Everything about this sw is clumsy. I dumped it and now use Nero.
2,Easy CD Creator 5.0 not so easy,"Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum is a lot of trouble for the price. I have to throw away about 5 cd's for every one that I sucessfully burn.That includes either data or music. This product goes through cd's like tissue paper and Roxio's solution is to reconfigure my PC for their software. My PC experience goes back all the way to the 1980's with a 386. I am currently running a 550p3 with 128 mg of ram, Win98se, with all the latest drivers etc. My advice, save your money and wait for the prices to come down or a competitor to come up with cd burner software that is not rocket science to use and such a waste of good cd's. I'm not at all pleased with this product."
1,Beware,"I have win xp...After installation, when using CD Creator 5 Platinum for the first time, it corrupted three CD's with data.Tried calling support for two days, was unsuccessful. Terrible program with terrible support. Never had a problem with Nero.Definitely do not recommend. It was a waste of money. They wouldn't even honor my request for a refund."
1,DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE XP!!,"I had Roxio on my 98SE machine and recently bought a notebook with XP, so I bought the Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum for my notebook. Even though the box said it was compatible with XP, when I installed it and attempted to reboot, I couldn't get my machine to reboot. I ultimately had to reinstall my OS, fortunately, I was able to get a full refund for Roxio, but I have decided to stick with the CD writer that is built into XP instead."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS !,This is junk. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for something else. This thing is crap and doesn't work.
3,Official release date was 02/26/01,"I wonder how the above reviews came to be, if Roxio didn't release this product til 2/26/01. Check for yourself at WWW.ROXIO.COM Someone is feeding you bunch of baloney?"
1,Just give it some time,"When I first began using this program it worked great. I had my cds burned quickly and easily and couldn't have been happier. Then, completely out of the blue, it just stopped working. It couldn't find any audio files or would say it was burning but never would. Surprisingly enough, the same thing happened on another computer that I had bought the application for. And do you think the customer service people were helpful? They never return emails and I gave up after sitting on hold for half an hour *multiple times*. Save your money and go with one that works."
1,Roxio CD Creator 5 is a poor performer.,"After the problems I ran into on CD Creator 5 on my XP, I wouldn't have another Roxio product on my computer.The Forst problem I ran into was that I could not import photos with file names longer than 32 characters including file extension. Roxio Tech Support solution was that I needed to shorten all my file names to less than 32 Charaacters.The second problem was my XP locked up every time I tried to save my Video Impressions file. Roxio Tech Support sent a very detailed procedure to reinstall CD Creator. The problem continued to occur, and I could not turn off my XP because of corrupted files or register. This problem went away when I removed the Roxio software.I will not use any Roxio products in my computer again, and recommend the same to everyone else."
2,Easy... but is it worth it?,"It works and produces few coasters... but is incompatible with many other programs. I installed securecrt and then easy cd creator wouldn't start. Finally I gave up and installed Nero... now I'm never going back. Easy cd creator is easy, but ... Nero is the better choice."
3,Good....If it works,I used it with Win ME and it was a wonderful software. Now that i upgraded to XP Pro. It doesn't seem to work. The update did not do anything. My 5.0 Platinum STAYED at 5.0 when i tried to install the 5.3 update.What a loss...
1,Lynn,Please save your money and don't buy this version. I shelled out the $.. to burn VCD's and all is does is hang. Version 4.1 works fine. The extra money you spend for all the new bells and whistles you might as well just set fire to it.
1,If you want headaches- buy this!,"A waste of time and money from the word ""go"".Operating system is a mess now (W98)...registry files unacessible...initialization errors...compounded errors.But the biggest error was buying it in the first place.If you're a computer geek with a desire to learn what can go wrong- by all means- go ahead."
1,Don't even bother,"When we had to upgrade our computer to Windows xp, I wasn't exactly thrilled to have a new burner program installed as well. (I believe it is called Riox) It just seems to be a waste of time, in order to create mixed cd's you have to go through the process of downloading and then saving and then converting the files. I never had to do this before with my old version. I also find this program not be user friendly at all. I don't recommend it."
4,Get More RAM if You Don't Want Errors,"This program works just like it should, burns CD's, creates Video CD's, and is easy to use. However, I couldn't figure out why I kept on getting ""clicks"" and ""blerps"" in my CD's. I had a brand new HP CD Burner so I knew it wasn't that. It was perplexing.I found out from my an old college friend that I needed more RAM. While the 32 or 64 megs will allow the program to operate, if you do ANYTHING else on your computer while you are burning the disc you will get errors. I bought a 256MB module for my computer through the... Memory Finder (found under Electronics, Computer Add On) and I have had no further errors.I highly recommend using this product with at least 256MB of Memory.P.S. The additional RAM makes the rest of my applications run about 5 times faster and the cost from ... was lower than anywhere else I could find on the web."
1,not worth it,I purchased this product and was very disapointed. Every time I tried to calibrate the printer or do anything with the grid adjustment it would lock up the computer. I got no help from their support. I purchased another product that works just fine.The label applicator works very well.
4,Does exactly what I want...,"My main purpose in buying this progam was to convert very old LP's and tapes to WAV format for burning onto CD's or MP3 format for keeping on my hard drive. It did this very well. The only problem was having to use 4X instead of 8X, but that may be my computer's problem rather than this program."
4,Cd-creator platinum v5.0,As an owner of versions 3 & 4 my first two attempts with the new title version 5.0 was unsuccessful because of the difficulty I had establishing copy speed of my two cdrw's resulting in ruining two discs. The buttons are pretty but this version is not as user friendly (simple) to use. I still do not know how to format a disc for backup purposes as I did in the past.
1,This software is dreadful,"I purchased a copy of Platinum 5.1 and after 2 days of attempts and about 4 hours of technical support I was told that the software couldn't be installed on my PC (which met the required system configuration) and that they often had problems with installation on Windows Me. However I was entitled to a refund. Unfortunately I would have to send the software to America to be able to action the refund which would probably cost me as much as I paid for the software in the first place! Do not touch this product unless you know it works on your PC. In addition, don't assume that because you've had a previous version you will be able to upgrade. Version 4 standard works fine on my PC but Platinum 5.1 won't even install!"
1,"The best software out there, what a joke!","I bought this software because I had heard all sorts of great things from computer tech people and friends. There is one major problem, if you have any type of Adaptec software on you computer it will not load. After spending two hours on the phone with one of Roxio's tech support guys, deleting files, renaming files, and attempting to load the software, nothing came of it. Then the guy from support said he would call back after consulting with others, and he did not. I also attempted to get help from Hp and they would not help. In other words if you own a computer with bundled software you cannot load Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum, even if you meet the system requirements."
3,Limitations of Spin Doctor component,"One of the main reasons I bought this is that the Spin Doctor component was advertised with the ability to eliminate pops, scratches, and other vinyl-recording noise, and to automatically split tracks at a gap in the sound. Turns out that only works for analog sources, such as your sound card. If you have a track already on CD originally from an analog source, Spin Doctor is useless for post-processing.I contacted tech support and at least they confirmed up front that this was the case, instead of sending me on wild goose chases.The ""bundled"" products, such as Spin Doctor and the WAV editing tool, I found in general to be not well integrated into the main product. It's more like a bunch of separately developed products all glued together with a menu instead of a ground-up integrated tool."
2,Easy CD creator Used to be,"This software usded to be the easiest and best cd burning software available. Since the changes for Windows XP, many features have simply been removed and not replaced. That is not the way to update software. In particular, the Take Two backup software was incompatible with XP, so Roxio simply eliminated backup software. The worst, though,is their customer support. They send e-mail alerting you that updates are available for the brand new version, designed for XP, then at the site are vague about whether it is necessary. Inqueries to Roxio return the following: if your cd burner seems to be working OK, don't bother with the updates. I prefer a company that at least seems to know what they are doing."
1,an updated mess,"I have rated this product 1-star based on the updated version as of the date of my previous review. Their tech support (email) produced no solution.Roxio has promised that the latest update will solve the problems; I tried it, and the situation has not changed.Do you have a zero-stars rating? No? Too bad."
3,Lots of info but thick reading,"This book would be great for anyone going into pediatric or neo-natal medicine. Anyone else should look elsewhere for a more clearly written treatment of this subject. The book contains a lot of information and I found the drawings very useful. However, the authors use of unnecessary medical terminology makes for slow reading - and I have a BS in Biology! If you buy this book, be warned... you WILL need an anatomy book as well to understand what structures are being discussed. A medical terminology dictionary may come in handy as well. For information content, I give the book a 4 - I found several congenital conditions were missing or only briefly mentioned. For writing style, I give it a 2 for the reasons discussed above."
3,Not a shabby job!,"Cutting to the chase -I liked this product, it wasn't too messy, the wax rubbed off my skin with ease and it seemed to do an extremely good job!my thighs - it got all the hair, didn't hurt and didn't leave a lot of wax residue. Not very bad welts afterwards either.armpits - OUCH! I don't know if I am just sensitive there, but BOY did that hurt!!!! It bled a little and only got about 50% of the hair in that area.i would buy this wax, i have tried other strips and this seems to be the better out of the bunch."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"Not using this for a grill, or a burner, but I am making propane fired torches. A few more parts purchased from various places and viola!! A propane tiki torche!"
2,a little short!,This hosed was advertised as 10 ft long but it is closer to 9ft. trust is built by truth in advertisment.
5,Dehydrating Made Easy,"Book Arrived in perfect condition, and as Described. Easy Read and step by step instruction. Even being very experienced with years of Dehydrating. I was suprised and delighted on some aspects of Dehydrating I didn't know about. Giving this Book a AAAAAAAA++++++ 5 Star Rating....."
2,Not what I thought,"Wanted something more for garden vegetables. Was not impressed, should have sent back. Don't want to make recipes want to dehydrate vegetables."
4,Another good cookbook,"Considering the increasing number of catastrophies occurring in these times, dehydrator cookbook is a major help for us in preparation for desaster."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. It could use some updates for today living. It covers alot, but not useful for me."
4,Mary Bell's Food Drying Manual,"Basically a good basic book. It gets down to what can be done, how and when. Can't ask much more than that."
5,I'd pay three times this amount for this book,"I've had my dehydrator for 5 years and thought I'd dried everything in every conceivable way but Mary Bell has some fantastic ideas. Easy read and easier recipes. Especially liked the section on backpacker food. My dehydrator has been running 24hrs/day since I got this book. Thank you, Mary Bell, for this great book."
4,Comprehensive,I appreciated seeing more information all in one place. I also liked the ideas that it generated.
5,Mary Bell's Dehyrator Cookbook,"Bought this book with my dehydrator and was so impressed that I bought additional assessories for the dehyrator. Her enthusiasm is surely contagious. She didn't answer all my questions but gave me the courage to experiment on my own with the help of the info I gleened from her book, other books, and the net. Not sure that I will save much money but I will save produce even if I give some of it away. And my cat Chat) loves her cat treats. I added Brewers' Yeast though. Margy"
2,Unpleasant smell,"I was very disappointed when I received the Cristalle parfum. I was hoping it would smell a bit like Chanel #5, my favorite, but pricey perfume. The Cristalle doesn't smell good at all, at least not on me. I understand everyone's body chemistry is different, so maybe the scent will smell nice on others. Just isn't for me."
3,Great Video/Poor Still Photos,"My husband gave me this camera for Christmas because he knew I really wanted a digital camera and I had expressed some interest in a camcorder as well...He figured this would do double-duty very well. I played with it all day Christmas day taking video and stills and was loving it. The video was awesome...very easy to use and of decent quality. Battery drained very quickly, but most do, so that wasn't a big deal. Close-up shots looked really good. The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT came when I downloaded the still shots to my computer. They were of poor quality at best...colors not true and blurry even though all were taken at the highest resolution possible. I am returning the camera and exchanging it. I'm NOW told that most just don't have enough pixels to produce a good photo...Live and Learn! Good Luck..."
3,"Simple, Easy steps to enjoying the Bible on a deeper level",This is a very simple book on how to interpret the Bible using the inductive method. It is broken down very well and put into a format that is easy to read and easy to practice on a daily basis.
1,Big Diappointment,I would NOT recommend buying this DVD. Poor production value and if you are expecting to enjoy some music by Christina prepare yourself for disappointment and boredom. It's about 90% PR people ranting about Christina and her accomplishments. I admire Christina's music and her God given talent for singing along with her hard work but this DVD is definitely worth passing up. I would recommend the Stripped Concert in the UK but NOT this one.
5,Marvelous!,"As a long-time Chuang-Tzu enthusiast, I thoroughly enjoyed this translation. I imagine this would be very enjoyable to the general reader; I have read many commentaries on the meaning of Chuang-Tzu's philosophy (Victor Mair's, Allinson's, Wing-Tsit Chan's, A.C. Graham's, etc.) so my perspective is ""biased"" in particular way- I like the absurdity and relativistic notions, sort of a Lewis Carroll point of view. This translation fits in with my predilictions nicely. Chuang-tzu takes some pondering, and any translation that makes it too simple is doing the reader an injustice. This one captures all the irony and absurdity, yet leaves plenty of room for befuddlement. It contains ALL the chapters, not just the inner ones. Highly recommended!! I keep this by the bed along with The People's Guide to Mexico, another perennial favorite!"
1,Sky Juice and Flying Fish: Traditional Caribbean Cooking,Not one recipe for flying fish in the whole book! What a disappointment.
5,Great Read,"The characters were so believable, and I liked the way they kept popping up in other stories. It made the stories read like a novel. I'm waiting for Guerrero's next book."
5,Excellent Source Material,"Excellent work and source material to explain the historical and cultural background of the ""New Testament"". I would disagree with the author's (and the Rabbi he leans on) conclusion of the purpose of the Gospel, though it is not as far off as the conclusions of the church at large. It explains who the Pharisees of the New Testament were and the difference between that group of Pharisees and the ones who evolved onto Rabbinic Judaism. It provides a basis for why Rabbinic works often appear to be a positive commentary and explanation of the writings of Paul and the Gospels, though they do not intend to. A must read for any serious student of the New Testament."
3,Glaring Omission,"Where are The Facts of Life and Flipper? This having been said, the NBC Nightly News theme by Williams (clocking in at precisely :30) is a work of true genius. To evoke pathos, drama, and urgency in one [very] short theme is no minor achievement.But no Facts of Life. Shame."
3,Bracelets,"I ended up returning these bracelets because they didn't match up to the picture. They were scratched and looked cheap. I wanted to give these bracelets as a wedding gift for my bridesmaids, but the bracelets didn't look like the picture so I returned them."
2,Big roar from a little kitten,"I've been reading Anne Perry and Robin Paige and liking these mysteries set in England in the Victorian/Edwardian eras. This author seemed a natural progression. And, yes, he writes well and his characters are interesting. In Test of Wills, the conclusion was surprising...which is the whole point of a mystery. In this effort, however, it was a great deal of sturm und drang for very little result. I can't figure out why anyone had to accept the murders silently, nor why they were really committed to begin with."
3,The sSpinners Live,"I am a huge fan of The Spinners and their music, saw them live at the Mill Run Theater in 1974 and they were phenomenal! Where did they find the guy that replaced the one and ONLY Philippe their original lead singer? Not even close I'm afraid. Ruined the experience for me. Too bad."
5,The Spinners I'll always love you,"After recently watching the Spinners brilliantly perform live in Prestatyn 2008, just after the passing of the great Pervis Jackson. This concert is a must for any Spinner fan.Pervis performs at his immaculate best."
2,"Nice looking, but not very compatible/hard to install","Tried to replace my broken patio door handle.3 15/16"" holes are compatible but that's pretty much it. The Mortise style lock would not fit because the hole on the door would not take the Mortise lock key fully in. There are many other incompatibilities, after struggling for an hour, managed to fit by using old handle on the other side of the door and old Mortise lock key. Disappointed overall although now it is functional."
3,"Pac-Land memorable, but the rest is not","This is the fourth in the series of Namco recreations of Arcade classics. It includes: Assault, Pac-Land, Ordyne, The Return of Ishtar, and The Genji and The Heike Clans. Assault is one of the better ones - it puts you at the controls of a 3-D tank fighting other tanks. Pac-Land is a memorable side-scrolling world that most Pac-Man fans will remember, but the rest of the world forgot. The rest of this collection consists of (at best) second rate arcade conversions that have no business being called ""Classics"". Only worth buying for Pac-Man and Play Station completists."
4,Quirky Electronic Pop,"This is a quirky little album, all in Russian, by Glukoza. The female singer has a crisp voice, almost chopping off each syllable. The slightly distorted guitar rifts are remeniscent of 1960s American beach music. And the seventh track is sure to bring a smile when you hear the phrase, ""Hasta La Vista."" All in all, an enjoyable album given to me by a recent emigrant."
3,Great Idea But 6 Ugly Signs in One,"I love festive signs in my yard that are wooden and you stick in the ground. I have one for every holiday, a general ""Welcome"" and of course, ""Happy Birthday"". They do pile up in the garage. That's why I thought this was a great idea AND it is. HOWEVER, the different signs that you can take off one stick, and just put another sign on the stick is ONLY a great idea....the interchangeable signs themselves are pretty tacky and ugly.My daughter started using Amazon.com a LONG time ago, and at the first of this year, showed it to me. We have bought not only a LOT of items from Amazon.com but a wide variety. This is the first complaint I've had."
3,Bernat Boa Yarn,I purchased this yarn through Amazon and it was delivered like they said it would be.The color was exactly what I was looking for. It was hard to find the starting end and was a little knotted. When I started my project I didn't realize how hard this type would be to use for the what I wanted it for. But in the end everything worked out OK. I do like the Bernat Yarn and will continue to purchase other types of yarn from them.
4,If you like solidity,"I have a well thumbed copy of this book. It has been the foundation of my repertoire for a number of years. I am no pro, just a better than average club hack. The strength of this opening system is that it is solid from both sides of the board. One is not likely to fall apart by move 10. On the other hand it is not an exhaustive system. There is not much against the Dutch. There is not a plan against early Benoni systems. As black the Queen's Gambit Tartakower system is great. The Caro-Kann requires considerable theoretical knowledge. Against prepared opponents one has to be on toes against the Panov-Bottvinik attack, the multiple advance systems, and the grind of the main line Petrosian Smyslov system. I have argued with Smith and Hall, but I keep coming back. I have won many games by playing solid until the other person self destructed. I reccomend it as a good foundation repertoire for average cautious players like me."
5,"Laying bare his chest, doing his best.","I hadn't listened to ""Trouble"" until very recently and found myself more than a little bit underwhelmed. I just didn't find myself identifying with it, it just didn't have any punch and I didn't care too much. After all, what's the matter with not liking someone's style of music? Nothing. Until your mind is utterly blown by their sophomore effort.This is an incredibly strong album, one of the best I've heard in quite some time. I'm lucky to find maybe ten albums a year I really, really enjoy an awful lot and this is up in my top three. The album sounds nearly folk but has an incredibly vibrant string section that provides just enough backing to tear into one's soul.Without question, my favorites are ""Empty,"" ""Three More Days,"" ""Lesson Learned"" and ""Till the Sun Turns Black."""
3,overkill....,"I was disappointed with the CD. While Ray's voice and lyrics are mesmorizing, how could they not be, I found all the horns unnecessary and downright annoying. It was the simplicity of his music, the emotion in his voice that carried us away. A little drums, a little strings, sure, but this CD is overkill. You have to wade through all the instruments to hear what he is saying. I have a ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" theory, and it wasn't broke."
5,A lucky shot,"I first heard the album title song during the closing credits to the movie The Conspiracy and was so moved by it that I checked out the music credits and sought out Ray La Montagne on Amazon and bought the album. I was a little worried that, as has often happened in the past, the song I heard in the movie would be the only good piece on the album (I'd never heard of this artist before). But how lucky I was to be wrong about that--I love the whole album. There isn't even one tune that I FF through. He has an unusual voice of great depth and feeling, and the band accompanies him with great sensitivity. I feel enriched to have stumbled upon this album."
3,good back drop music I was looking for a little more rock,The hit on the cd is assume I was hoping for a little more rock. I have had it on with people over for dinner it is perfect for that. He reminds me of Ben Harper the same sort of somberness but not as much rock.
5,Stunning Voice,His voice is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard. Throaty and soothing but so unique. You can listen to this album from start to finish. He is a rare talent in this day of auto tune...he needs nothing to make him sound so beautiful.
1,Terrible battery charger,Don't bother with this junk. This is a subpar battery charger adapted for the Wii. The batteries included do not hold an adequate charge. Go with a better charger designed specifically for the Wii (NYKO) or with a decent NiMH charger. The docking ports only hold the remotes and aren't used for charging.
3,pretty good book,"This novel kept me reading on and on, the writing style is very familiar although I have never read any of Joy Fielding's work. It's very smooth and easy going to read.As much as I thought this book was great; I wasn't too excited by the end. I must say I found that the story came to an abrupt stop. All the work that went into the buildup and storyline felt wasted!I would have happily gave this book a higher rating, if it wasn't for that. Otherwise, it is pretty well written, and was interesting for the most part."
2,Unsatisfactory Ending,"This book started out sprightly enough, but was ultimately tedious and ending with some plot holes totally unplugged. Escapist fiction shouldn't leave the reader depressed. Avoid the Brilliance Audio version, which includes plot details that don't show up until cassettes 7 and 8 on the cover blurb."
3,"not as good as domain or conquerers, but worth checking out","This is album is pretty average in my opinion. While it contains some absolutely brutal drumming and punishing guitar riffs, the harmonics don't seem to flow as evenly as Krisiun's other albums. The one song that i do love is track number 2, as it has an absolutely classic dark metal feel to it. Worth checking out, but not nesscesarily worth buying unless your really into Krisiun."
1,I agree with the previous reviewer...,"but I think he was too generous. I can NOT sit through this album. I love death metal, and I love blast beats, but this is just ridiculous. This album has one speed and one drum beat. It is constant blasting and constant double bass, absolutely boring. Now if you are the type of death metal fan who thinks ""doood if it has constant blasting that means it's soo brooooootal"" then by all means, buy this today. But if your brain is intact, and you like your death metal to actually be MUSIC and not just mindless blasting, then don't get this."
5,Wonderful Book!,"If you're interested in trees and like walking in San Francisco, you must get this book. Very well written and the pictures are a wonderful way to spot the trees. Directions are great too. Buy this book for yourself and give it as gift also!"
2,Not a $400 thing,"I bought two of these, one with the headset and one without, for hunting coyotes at night. They are hard to use, not very clear, and the field of view is dreadful. This is a not a tool worth $400."
2,"Readable, though not enjoyable.","I finished this book about an hour ago, and I am left with a feeling of numbness. The book seemed shallow, the characters uninteresting, and I feel that so much potential available to the storyline was left untouched. Most of the book was rather predictable, and where it wasn't predictable, it certainly wasn't surprising.I'm glad that I didn't buy this book; it was given to me by someone else. I don't feel it's really worth the money. The book wasn't exactly a waste of time, but I could have spent that time reading a more valuable piece of literature."
4,"A fun tribute, filled with genuine love","As with most tribute albums, about half of the tracks here are people trying their best to sound like the artist...which in Harry's case is just not possible...and the rest are 'rethinkings' of the songs. It's hit-and-miss, with some wonderful performances (Ringo, Adrian Belew, Marshall Crenshaw) some inspired contributions (Victoria Williams, Randy Newman) and some real duds (Fred Schneider's ""Coconut"" is just awful). But it doesn't really matter, because everyone here genuinely loves Nilsson, and it shows."
3,"Not my favorite, but a Kindergarten Classic","This manuscript was reportedly found among Dr. Seuss's things after he died, and was finished and published by his wife.This is not my favorite Dr. Seuss, but a cute book nonetheless. Mayzie suddenly sprouts a daisy on top of her head, and the town is in an uproar trying to figure out what should be done! With a ""There's No Place Like Home"" and Forgiving Family ending, it's worth reading.It seems like I had more trouble reading the rhymes smoothly than with other Seuss favorites."
1,do NOT buy this book,"I love Seuss. I think I owe my relationship to language to him. I am now reading all his work to my daughter.But know this: this book does NOT count as a ""real"" Dr. Seuss book. The illustrations are PURE trash, and the story may have turned into a real Seuss work, if he'd worked on it further (it sounds like scribbled notes for a story)."
3,A little strange,"Bought it only because the child it was for is named May, but it ended up being cute. A little strange, though...but I read that's because it was written before Seuss died, never finished, and published afterward. Not quite to the standard of other Seuss books, but good nonetheless."
3,It Writes - It's Comfortable,"My wife uses these in her business where there lot's of pen thieves. They are comfortable to write with and write smoothly. They also dissapear, evidently, even the thieves like them. For everyday office use, these are fine.If you want a pen that writes smoother and the ink dries immediately, check out the Pentel EnerGel Liquid Gel Ink, Model BL-77. This is the one I use everyday.The Uniball Signo 207 is a good pen too, but the ink does not dry as fast, and if you're left handeed, you're going to have smudges as your writing hand drags across the ink.STAY AWAY FROM THE PILOT G-2 PEN. It has a terrible tendency to leak on airplanes."
4,Classic games from early consoles.,"I've noticed that quite a few people are complaining that the versions of the various games are from the SNES and Genesis consoles rather than the PC versions. As a console gamer, I find these games to be spot on and quite enjoyable. Aside from some minor sound issues on Mutant League Football. ( A sort of tinny warble) The games play exactly as I remember them and look pretty good on the handheld. So if you didn't play these on the PC in their so-called ""better"" versions, and you're looking for a little old-school gaming, EA Replay is a good choice."
5,Troubled Waters,"If you're a fan of Jennifer Beals then this is a must own. Beals performance is nothing short of astounding. The movie is similar to that of Sixth Sense with twists and turns throughout, making you wonder whose behind what and will keep you guessing until the end."
2,Too Many Errors,"This would be a helpful book if someone just took the time to fix all the errors. In the author's acknowledgements he writes, ""The weird thing about technical writing is that sometimes your brain appears to disengage."" Whether it is the author or the editor's fault I don't know, but someone's brain was disengaged. Until this book is revised, don't bother wasting your money on it, there are far better books available for Network+ preparation."
3,A book about William Thomas,"When I first saw this book for sale, I was very keen on getting a copy as soon as I could (I was on a kind of Lenny Bruce book-finding mission--and still am). After going everywhere to try to find a used copy and could not, I put out the 27 bucks. Anyway, here's why I, with much reservation, give it only three stars (should be two really). It's not about Lenny Bruce! In fact, at best, he's a bit part in a not-so-interesting story about this Thomas guy (Lenny talks about him a little in his writings here and there, but he's just another guy in the life of Lenny). If you're interest in the author, get the book. If you're interested in Lenny Bruce, there are a least ten books that you should read before this, mostly, non Lenny literature."
5,Great book,"I love the logic behind this book, I love the 'self tests' there are. This book helps you figure out how to connect to yourself emotionally and how to help your kids grow and be healthy, well balanced emotional beings. It teaches you that no emotions are ever wrong- just how we express them or deal with them are wrong. It gives you tools to be a great 'emotional coach' to your kids which will help them for the rest of their lives!This book needs to be read over and over and over again!"
5,raising an emotionally intelligent child,This is the best child development book I have ever read! It was incredibly helpful and an answer to a prayer. I have encouraged everyone I know to read it and I quote it every day. Thank you!
3,Interesting ideas,"There were some interesting ideas in this book, but it didn't stand out for me in the see of similar-themed parenting books."
5,Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child,Every parent should read this book. It has helpful information for all aspects of any relationship.
3,"too soft, kids expect the parent to be stronger!","Kids are the best psychologists especially for their own parents, so , a tough stance and being is better than otherwise."
4,"Nice cover! Well built, lifetime warranty, good instructions.","I reviewed a lot of different kinds of covers out there, and this was the right mix of quality, value, and warranty. I heard a lot of good things about the TruXedo brand, but Lund offered the same thing, for a significantly less. I've only owned about a month, but so far, it is holding up extremely well. Your pocket book will thank you!"
5,The best album in the world go out and buy it,"Steps are the greatest pop group who have ever lived. Their songs are fantastic and I love them all especially H. They are all extremely talented and all have fantastic voices. Steps to me are the best, I can't wait to see them at Wembely because no matter how big or small they go they will always be my number 1 pop group. Make sure you buy their album step one and their new one which will be out in October."
3,Russia's version of our Jack London,"When people hear the term Siberia, they usually think of a wasteland destination for Russia's criminals, scapegoats, and political prisoners. What is forgotten is that this huge expanse of land is rich in life both animal and human, that the latter has existed her for millenia and have created their own cultures, languagues, and lifestyles. This fiction book tells the story of some of these natives, as described by a Russian author with personal experience of this region. The book does a good job in describing how people everyday interact with nature and with each other. One of the best scenes in the book describes the experience of living through a snowstorm. For those familiar with American literature, this book closely resembles the writings of Jack London, naturalism with an emphasis on human - nature coexistence. I recommend this book as a good way to learn about a part of the world most of us will never see."
2,Collections of previously released material,I have to echo the warnings. When Tangerine Dream came out with this two CD set - it really made me drop off the wagon of buying every TD Dream album I could get my hands on (and I have over 50 of them counting solo works). I have never been able to understand the TD catalog since these CDs came out. Buyer beware if you already have a complete collection. It's okay if you want to have a sample of their stuff however.
3,If you want only pass an examination.,"This book is a good summary of basic biostatistics and epidemiology, but only that. If you want more deep please look in other books."
2,Didn't live up to it's reviews at the time.,I bought this camera about 3 years ago. At the time it had great ratings so I went ahead a bought it from another store. It takes horrible pictures. If it is not a picture taken outside with lots of light you will get a dark grainy picture. The video on it is pretty good again in bright light. I would not recommend this product.
2,Good at first,"I bought this camera about 7 months ago and thoguht it was great, except for the pictures were somtimes discolored. But now it is broken. The camera will lock up when the zoom button is pressed. Overall i was not happy with this camera and got a new one and differnt brand more reliable."
3,Felt backing was improperly glued + Scratches on the wood,"There were minor scratches on the wood. Felt backing was improperly glued and the whole thing was coming apart. The pad cannot be used after completely removing the felt backing because it is very sticky. Though it is messy and sticky, the glue is not strong enough to hold the felt together. Had to apply wood glue to stick the felt and had to leave it to dry for a day. But, ever since, I have not had a problem with using the pad, and I am happy using it. I am giving it a 3 for all the trouble I had to go through."
4,Nice desk pad,"The desk pad is attractive. I would have rated this as five stars, but because of a scratch on the wood I gave it four stars. Note: The pad is about a third of an inch thick, with the wood pencil tray it's about an inch thick."
4,Nice writing surface,"I would have given this 5 stars but they really should put some rubber on the back side of this. It slips around on my desk too much. Besides that, great craftmanship and affordability"
2,Arrived Damaged,"Product is nice and feels comfortable, but packaging is virtually non-existant. Arrived with wood chipped and falling apart. Instead of messing with a return I colored in the chips and glued the wood back to the pad."
5,very pleased!,"I was very pleased with the quality of this item. Many more that I found available for purchase were ""extremely"" expensive. I got the look I wanted for a decent price and good quality."
5,Best Bassnectar Album Ever,"I can't get over how much I love this album. It was the first album I heard of Lorin's (frontman of Bassnectar) about 4 years ago. Stop, Underground Communication, and Kick it Complex have had me jamming out in my car from that day. I have been desperate ever since to see him play anything from this album live. It's just ridiculously good and hard to describe how good it is until you listen to it for yourself. I would buy this album for sure!"
4,T&J are always good,"I've been a fan of Tom and Joy since hearing ""Like Ours"" on the Bossa Mundo 2 compilation disk a few years ago. This CD does not disappoint. Joy's vocals are excellent as always. Recommend for the car, around the house or when entertaining."
4,Nice Camera,"My friend has this camera,And he gave it to me for my sons birthday,I started using it right away. no manual. no nothing.Really great quality nice zoom.What more do u want ?;-)Enjoy."
4,"A tighter, more polished def jux Aesop","I just got this album and so far it's sounding pretty good. If you're like me and are hoping for a pre-Bazooka Tooth Aesop Rock, you won't find that. However, it sounds like Aesop is finding his groove with the different production style. The beats and choruses complement him more than they did in Bazooka Tooth (there are a lot less moments where he sounds goofy and weird) and the 7 tracks are pretty consistent in quality. There aren't any songs that totally blew me away on first listen, but overall I'm getting a really good vibe from this cd. For me, it's definitely a step up from the last album.The cd also comes with a lyric book with lyrics from float to this cd. This totally justifies the price of the package."
1,What a piece of junk,"Save your money, this item is a turd.The plastic is cheap and the opening so small you can't fit your hand in. The opening is also smaller than the storage area making retrieving your items a pain.Do yourself a huge favor and buy the OEM storage bin, it will cost more but will be worth it. If an OEM piece is not available the Metra storage bin is a good option. (although the older versions had little shelves for cd storage, which limits the capacity)"
2,What a disappointment,"While the premise of this book is intriguing the delivery was disappointing at best. The analogies between golf and business were trite and not very illustrative. Good analogies between golf and business process analysis do exist, such as the way that statistical analysis and feedback loops are used by pros to reduce variation in shot accuracy and eliminate wasted motion in their swings. ""Shots into bunkers represent waste"" is about as sophisticated as this book gets."
3,Too Shiny - a review of Sandstorm,"First, the good news. This eyeshadow lasts and it doesn't crease. I don't know about 12-hours of wear, because I don't wear makeup for that long during the day, but it certainly last 8-hours although it might be a tad shear at the end.Now for the bad news. I tried the ""Sandstorm"" and despise the color. For one thing the darkest shade looks much lighter than it appears in either the picture or the container. I wanted a dark, subtle brownish shade, but it's none of these things. The darkest shade is so shiny and light in color that I'd never consider wearing it to the office. It's like something you'd expect a teen to wear. Too light for a sophisticated look.Pam T~"
5,Just what I wanted,I was pleasantly surprised that I could still get this. I suppose they are not making them anymore. Received them as expected.
5,Great Heavy Duty Cart,"Loaded the cart right away in its basic configuration (short, flat 4-wheel) with a 375 pound woodstove (cart rated for 500 pounds) and it handled it with ease. I was concerned with the front wheels, which are plastic with a metal swivel on this model, but the cart was very easy to move and steer with all that weight.The cart is easy to reconfigure to; handle or handle-less, short or long length, etc. I haven't used it yet as an appliance dolly, but I can see where the longer length ""tongue"" would be helpful at times over my standard appliance dolly.Cart has non-skid strips, a nice finish, easy to understand instructions for use and I can see many uses for moving almost anything due to its versatility.Bought from Shoplet through Amazon.comHighly recommend."
5,Must have this one.,"The photos are the best on the area. The one that scared me was the one where Dave takes a picture of himself in the glass and then a few seconds later a beam falls where he was just standing. The photos of the jet pieces all over the ground and the thick dust that was everywhere makes it all real and all the more haunting and terrible. But we must have these in front of us, because what happens, we forget. Let's not forget. Those people don't deserve that."
4,A Photographic Record for the History Books,"Excellent Photographic Record from many different angles. The book contains page after page of riveting photographs. The publishers have packed the book with mostly large full color images that capture the full force of the event.For those who may be interested, Dr. Judy Wood has published the first and only forensic investigation into the events of Sept. 11, 2001. After reading her book, 'Where did the towers go?' the photos of the destruction actually begin to make sense. drjudywood(dot)comI have rated the book four stars because the descriptions that accompany the photos are cursory to non-existent.Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11"
2,Nice pictures - but repetitive!,"Nice pictures of great quality and angles. They, however, after the first few pictures, get repetitive. If you have seen the first half a dozen, then you have seen most of them. The same smoking buildings, hazy skyline and gloomy skies - in several dozen different angles!A decent book to buy secondhand for less than 2 or 3 dollars. Not worth buying brand new."
5,Aqua View Water Filter,The filter is easy to use and I especially like the green (also yellow and red flashing lights) that signal the condition of the filter.
3,Very basic. Good for beginners.,"The book is very basic, along the lines of the Dummies series. There is a screenshot of everything, which makes the book long. If you are just starting out, the book is good because it is comprehensive. However, there is a high percentage of garbage in the book, such as detailed instructions on how to bookmark a page in a Web browser, and a couple chapters on how to write HTML. The book is mainly a how-to book, not a book with many advanced selling and buying tips.After reading the top eBay books, below are my recommendations:---Beginner with eBay and computers---1. The Official eBay Bible---eBay Seller---1. Sell it on eBay2. eBay Hacks---Full-Time eBay Business (not for the casual seller)---1. eBay Strategies2. eBay Business the Smart Way"
1,Long winded - and not enough of what I needed,"I thought a new book about ebay would give me some fresh ideas. It didn't. There was a long, step by step HTML tutorial. It is no longer valid for use on ebay since they have their own HTML online designer to help you with your auctions. Mr. Griffith's opinions are his own, and although he may have worked for ebay for a long time, he obviously isn't sucessfully selling on the site regularly. His opinions on transactions and feedback left me cold. This book seems only to reveal what ebay (the company) wants us to know. It just doesn't live up to the high levels that some other books on ebay have established."
2,Is the Joke on me?,"If you're a fan of Techno or House music, you'll probably love this stuff. It's so far removed from the original Joke material, though, that I've only played it once. I need Geordie's guitars."
3,Space Opera that makes sense,"With all due respect to ERB, the Barsoom books always left me unsatisfied. I couldn't shut off that part of my brain that says ""There is no possible way this could ever happen."" L. Sprague De Camp's Krishna series, while still being nice, light Space Opera fare, reconcile the swordplay and spaceships well enough that I've never had that problem with them. These two stories are not the best in the series, but not the worst either; all in all, fairly representative of the series."
5,Another Gaither success,"My husband is a big fan of Bill Gaither and his musical productions. This was a gift for him, and he loves watching it."
5,The Firm Body Sculpting System--Advanced Cardio Blast,"The Firm line of work out products is by far the best I have ever tried. Its combination of weights and aerobics melts off the fat and tones muscles at the same time. During my pregnancy, I gained a total of fifty pounds. Thanks to the firm, I now weigh ten pounds less than I did before I got pregnant, and it only took me a couple months to take it all off. The Firm videos are time efficient and fun. The music they are syncronized to is upbeat and fun. I would highly suggest anyone with a desire to tone up try these out!"
5,A great video for a great price!,"I get all my best buys at Amazon. I love the Richard Simmons DVDs, he is so encouraging, and anyone can do them.I always get great service from Amazon, and will continue to purchase from them."
5,Love it!,"Fun, makes you sweat - real people on the dance floor. Easy on the knees. Good cardiac workout for us older folks."
2,Not easy,"Well there are many different exercises and it's hardto grasp the routine, the music was ok but thereare no floor exercises so you count solely on thearobics being fun but it wasn't - I got thru it butprobably wouldn't try it again for quite awhile."
4,Party Off The Pounds,"The video is fun. You really dont know how hard you are working out until you start sweating which is the second song. The music is good for the era. People may laugh about it, but when you get started they see how fast you start working out. The more you do it the easier the steps get. I was shocked at how well I felt after using the first time I thought I woulod be worn out but I felt so good just to get moving. Its not by any means simple but it will get ya moving! I love it and when I can Im getting more of them to do."
4,"Light Cardio, Big Room","I like this DVD. It's great to have in rotation for those days when you cannot do anything more intense. I did it this morning because the heat wave is so intense I didn't want to over-exert myself with a more challenging workout. Richard is a good leader, but there aren't many instructions for those who are newbies to aerobics. With that said, this DVD isn't brain surgery and it should be easy to catch on within a few workouts. The most difficult thing for me is that it requires a fair amount of space. I find myself either turning to fit into the room to do the exercise or modifying a move altogether so I don't have to use up so much space. I do Zumba, too, and I think this DVD requires more space than Zumba."
3,work out,This was ok. I was expecting these songs with original artists but the moves were pretty easy to follow.
4,Very touching story,"This is indeed a beautiful story... I confess it made me laugh and cry also.So many sad events but with a very happy ending, this book carries an historical background that I'm not sure is accurate... But in the end is all comes down to a love story :)"
2,It was pretty good!!,I really enjoy Danielle Steel Books. It was just to sad for me. For someone else this would probably really touch there heart.
5,Danielle Steel's best...,"This was the first book I ever read by Danielle Steel and became instantly hooked. By far, her best novel to date. I've read it over and over, and each time find myself crying for Paxton. It's emotional, but so realistic, you feel as if you're there with her, witnessing everything. It not only tells the story of a remarkable woman, but also about the horrible events of Vietnam. By the end of the novel, you can't stop thinking about Paxton, and everything that she had endured in her life. You wonder how anyone can be so strong. Only Danielle Steel can create such an honorable character that you remember forever."
5,it was the best!,This novel was the best .Im loved it so much. I am reading it for a second time right now.and Danielle Steel is my fav author
1,"obscure, pretentious nonsense","This is the only book I have ever thrown across the room in disgust. Honestly, I was open to whatever its message was (after all, I'd read John C. Lilly and Carlos Castenada, ""experimented"" as we used to say, and taken mind- bending philosophy classes). But the pretentious, garbled nonsense, and the author's love affair with his own profundity, grew to be too much. Just about every fourth ""word"" was in ""quotation marks"" to remind us that the ""author"" found ""language"" inadequate to express his great ""truths"" about ""reality"". As it turns out, he was right; it was inadequate.I remember the sound that the book made as it splatted against the wall. Mortified, I hastened over to make sure it wasn't badly damaged.Amazingly, there are still 27 used copies for sale at Amazon. If one of them is my old paperback, I hope it's doing well."
5,Deeply Relaxing,"I have tried many guided meditation CDs in the past for relaxing and de-stressing. This is definitely one of the best. The music is so soothing and pleasurable that even by itself would be very effective as a relaxation tape. Add to that the narration which is gently reassuring and leads you to a very calm place. I like all of the tracks, but especially the ""Total Body"" selection which works great as a bedtime prep for a good night's sleep. Overall a great CD."
2,Ok if you can live with short battery life,"Charged it appropriately. Easy to set up. First day after full charge - one 20 min phone call and off the base for about 6 hours total. Low battery indicator. Hmm. Followed instructions and re-seated battery. Charged again for 16 hours until fully charged. Today - full charge. One 10 min phone call. Off base for 8 hours. Totally dead. Was brand new in package. Taking it back. Not fooling with battery life on a brand new phone. Phone was nice, though. Therefore the 2 star rating."
1,Won't hold a battery charge,"I had same problem others on website are reporting. I returned the phones and got another set hoping it was just a bad set. Same problem, so I returned them again. It's a real shame because I like every other feature about the phone. Don't buy!"
3,Good Dinner Music,"First of all, I want to say that this is not a bad album. Stanley Turrentine is a very good tenor sax player. I think that I have been spoiled by John Coltrane. When I hear ""In a Sentimental Mood"" I keep expecting to hear the ""sheets of sound"" that only Coltrane can play. Like I said Stanley is a very talented sax player, but this album just dosen't do it for me. I suggest ""The Gentle Side of John Coltrane"" or John Coltrane Plays for Lovers."""
5,Almost unbelievably beautiful,"There are only a handful of choral pieces here among many instrumental arrangements (which I don't care for), but those have become favorites in my collection of Renaissance polyphony. One or two of the songs are the most beautiful music I have ever heard."
2,Aversion to standard typography,"Instead of using quotation marks, Huston signals dialogue with long ''em"" dashes. Why? When we have the answer to that, we will have the motive behind every deliberately egregious literary pretension the only payoff of which can be to make the reader's work harder."
4,A Fitting End,"Three books with Charlie Huston's ""Dangerous Man"" come to an end with the finale. More of the terse dialougue and quick action that should be honey for any fan of the genre. Twists and turns come fast in all of Huston's books (I have recently discovered the Joe Pitt character of his as well) and this one is no different - starting fast and never letting you stop reading.Recommended Highly"
5,Don't buy the mp-3's,"for the sme price of MP-3's You can have the disc and informative booklet, Helps to appreciate the music when you have more background knowledge. plus you get the cool photos too"
1,Chinese Torture,"What a yawner! This is one of the worst books I've ever read! I teach a class in Creative Writing at a well-known univeristy. If one of my students submitted this, I'd consider changing careers. Bottom line: No character development, no plot, no story: NO GOOD!"
1,Worst-Book-Ever,"I almost feel bad writing a review for this book, because I didn't actually read it. At least past the first two pages. I couldn't. The ""edgy"" street-wise language was unbelievably foul and unbearable to read. I got a headache just trying to read it. After the second page, and doing a quick skim through the rest (which confirmed my fear that the rest of the book was the same), I tossed it in the trash. I bought it on the dollar discount table and still felt fleeced. Serves me right for not taking a better look at it first."
5,Great Crime Novel,"A book that takes the crime novel paradigm, pulls it apart, and puts it together. It reads like a chant. Admirable, from beginning to end."
1,"yawn, yawn, slower, slower","I appreciated the author's efforts to define the edge as he saw it, and yet this novel's paper thin artifice and lack of depth made it difficult to keep my eyes open past page four. I am sorry I cannot recommend this book."
4,OK,Small issue of the ATX power socket having four pins more than my NEW ATX power supply. Took some discussion before I was satisfied. Turns out I only needed a CPU chip. Now I might as well finish a 2nd system and turn it into another Hardware Firewall.
2,what's up w/ the price,"I've just started listening to these guys, thier great, i saw show last saturday night in a small review. great live show. i go to purchase a live cd and was shocked by the price. $129 for a new and $33.00 for used. thier good but not that good!"
2,It kind of worked but...,"At first, this product seemed to work just fine. Then I noticed that my eyelashes were more brittle and lots fell out just when I rubbed my eyes. I had been using a different product before I got this and things were fine. So I know that this isn't just a coincidence. Yes, my eyelashes did get fuller, but I'd rather thin lashes to none."
1,"If I ha to read the lyrics to another song, I think I would have thrown the book out the window!","Okay, first of all, this was my first Karen Robards book and I have a hard time thinking I might read another one. I was so incrdibly disappointed with this story!1. Why do we have to read the lyrics to songs over and over again? that was ridiculous! I don't need to read entire paragraphs of the lyrics to ""Ghostbusters""!2. I got really annoyed with the fact that she referred to him - even after they had slept together - as Frankenstein!!! What was up with that?3. The ghost that kept appearing was a really silly side plot, especially the ending! (Although, I liked the part with the Mother and Aunt.)This book took me days and days to read! I couldn't stay interested in it long enough!"
1,chocolate for healthy!,My cats did not like this at all and would not eat it. Some healthy cat foods have been refused by my cats and they are expensive. There should be more samples. I guess it would be like having a choice between broccoli and chocolate for most people!
1,"Pretty paperweights. Useless ""highlighting"".","When they did work, they highlighted (blacked out!) WAY TOO DARK so you could barely read the text through the darker colors (purple, I had one pack w/a blue in it, etc). Then they dried out COMPLETELY after just a few weeks of extremely minimal use.Who ever thought you'd need to read a review about a highlighter!?These suck."
4,We're all alone (but young japanese men are extra-especially alone),"What is it with young men in so much Japanese literature? Whether it's Murakami, Mishima, Soseki, or Dezai they always come across as either lonely, shut-off or damaged (or some combination of the three). Yozo feels about as radically alienated from the world as any character could be. Even bitchy little Holden Caulfield never carried half as much angst as the main character in No Longer Human seems to have. And the loneliness he feels is all the more painful because of how deeply internalized it is, and how total his inability to communicate with others has become. Glum though it is, this book does do a really good job of showing how vast the chasm can be between what other people think about you, and what you think about yourself"
5,It is what it is.,Its a case. It works. It fits. It attracts a little dust. Its typical though. A good case. No problems.
1,Garbage,These are so flimsy compared to my old pair. It was nearly impossible to get them to fold the first time. The pieces don't fit together very well.
4,Great Product,The Kreg product is great for providing quick and easy joinery. You will be amazed how quickly and strongly projects go together.
2,Good beginning but it goes downhill from there ...,"Book starts promising, with some likeable characters. But the lack of development in the characters, the frequent jumps in the timeline, and the frequent changes in first person narrative created a book that was hard to follow and like. And the author leaves many questions unanswered at the end."
5,Rainbow- A Star Studded Tribute to Judy Garland,"Just an amazing bunch of vignettes about the greatest performer of all time!! I especially like the one about being in the audience before she comes out, and my other favorite is about what is happening behind the scenes till she takes a deep breath and walks out on stage! She really hits the nail on the head with her own article about herself, as well!!! I'll enjoy re-reading this forever!!!!"
5,Great product,"I had been buying this product for a long time at a local Walmart but they just stopped carrying them and I was then looking everywhere for a store that I could purchase them from. I then decided to look online and there it was, the pork rinds. I then placed an order and will be placing more orders to come. Thank you for a great product.Scott Bachtelle"
4,You need this if you have any kind of pocket hole jig!,This is a MUST for any pocket hole user. Sure helps to have a short and long spare in the case that comes with your tool. You never know when it's going to break or you'll misplace it in the shop. You know you will never find the one you lost until you get another one in the case! That's how it works for me.4 stars because I think they should be as hard if not harder than the screws and last longer. If you screw a LOT of screws look at the tip. Mine are bent around in a twist but they still work! I have not broken one yet but I'm anticipating it soon.
4,Kreg square drive bits,"The Kreg screws have such a high hardness that with just a few slips the driver's tip will show wear. I've tried square drivers in several different brands and didn't find the Kreg special- it seems about the same as Irwin. The Senco EA0123 5"" lg square drivers that I recently picked up on sale at HD seem to hold up better than both the Kreg and Irwin. The 5-6"" length is the most useful to me- Amazon should sell only the 6"" length drivers in pkg quantities."
2,Needs updating,"This book is dated. It is helpful to gain a historical perspective on the development of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), but if Harvard wants to remain a leading edge authority on business practices it needs to update these essays. For example, illustration of a concept using the example of Ford Pintos and gas tanks. This is 2012! I was a teenager when that happened and now I'm middle-aged. CSR is developing rapidly and there are many current examples to share. Get with it, Harvard Business Review!"
3,"Lots of rare interview audio/footage, but that's about it...","I'm only reviewing the DVD content - I have not purchased this item, but rather rented it from a well-known DVD-by-mail company.The title is correct; this is The Who's story, in their own words. Lots of archival interview audio is used, and to a lesser extent, archival video as well, and a the content comes from all four members of the band. I'm a big Who fan, and most of these interviews I had never heard/seen before.Unfortunately, one can certainly tell this is an unauthorized, independent release. There are lots of small errors - like on-screen graphics that note Jon Astley produced ""I Can See For Miles"" or misspelling Roger's last name as ""Daltry."" The target audience for packages like this is CLEARLY Who completists."
3,First Strike,"It's the first time I've been vaguely diappointed by one of Kinky's books. I won't repeat some of the quibbles other have pointed out (but boy, does Stephanie stink). My paperback edition was the UK one which was rather expensive for the few pages (208, to be precise) it contained. Add lots of white pages in this edition and 45 chapters and not too much text is left. Also, I thought at first that this book had been published in, well, 45 parts in some paper before, as much information is rehashed again and again.Kinky's dialogue always is a lot of fun, though and the change of location did the book good, too. I enjoyed the last third most, and even the plugs for his friend's works have a rather charming quality."
3,Not His Best,"Not only did I think Rainbow wasn't Friedman's best; I wondered if it's really Friedman's. What happened to Ratso? Why is Stephanie without any personality traits except annoyance? Why are there fewer of those precious Kinky gems (literary road apples?) I enjoy so much? While the plot is as good if not better than most of Kinky's books, I read his books for the characters and the charm of his warped wit. Either Kinky needs a sabbatical or a better quality ghost writer. Nevertheless, it won't stop me from seeking his books; he's one of a kind, and even a mediocre Kinky Friedman book is better than many, many other writers'."
5,GREAT LCD TV,"I have Cable, DVD & Playstation hooked up to it and have not had any problems. Great picture and easy to use remote."
2,Sound quality,"I recently purchased the 2415 with 2 additional hansets and am very dissapointed with the sound quality for this type phone (2.4). The system has lot's of bells & whistles and great funtionality but the sound quality is terrible. The 1st base unit was exchanged a week ago because as you were talking, other person's words would get chopped off and was not understandable. Seimens stated was a bad unit and return. The new one I got now has a hissing (Static) noise and tunnel noise on base and all handsets. Great phone concept but key functional elements are poor. Going to exchange again tomorrow one more time and if I have same problem, all goes back for something that works.........."
1,Unreliable phone,"I had the same problems as everyone else. Pretty much out of the box, nobody could understand me b/c it was very garbled. I sent the almost new phone back to siemens and they gave me a very used refurbished one that has similar problems. On the other side, the answering machine, once figured out, had very good sound quality. Overall a big waste of money."
1,Lousy product,"I've had this phone with several extensions for more than a year now, and boy is it a disappointment. Callers to one extension constantly complain about poor reception; tunnel sounds are a great way to describe it. Even after I replaced the extension with a new one, I still had the same problem.Caller-id, which has always been spotty, has been completely unreliable over the last 6months. At first I thought my neighbors installed a WiFi network, but a recent wardrive found few signals.Customer service, though friendly was completely useless, and refused to do anything about the phone.Bottom line: Siemens never again. Great design, lousy brand."
1,Great Design but...,"I bought this phone 1 year and 3 months ago. I loved the simplicity of the design and ease of functions, until the keys started sticking. Some of the buttons have to be pushed again and again before registering, which is not only frustrating but makes it impossible to enter numbers on calls requiring you to do so to navigate menu selections (like calling Siemens customer care!)."
2,"Super extras, Unacceptable Audio.","This phone will probably be the coolest-looking one you've ever owned. However, like me - you'll probably grow weary of the subpar audio. Range is sufficient at best, but my 900Mhz Uniden easily outdistances this by at least 100Feet. With the handset volume at default levels, there is a constant hiss. Only when lowering the volume to the absolute minimum is the quality somewhat improved (tho conversation is difficult with volume so low).On the upside, the phone has an endless list offeatures that would satisfy anyone wanting high-tech. But I find myself wishing the engineers spent less time on the 'pc' side of it, and more time on the 'telephone'.I am returning this set."
3,Love and hate,"It would be interesting that somebody of Siemens tells us that it is happening, because there are people that award a serious problem in the system of audio of the telephone. I was resolved to buy it, but now I have a great doubt."
4,Beware of Siemens mail-in rebate offers,"I purchased the Siemens Gigaset 2415, a great phone and answering machine with easy to use features. Its in-city away from the base range is as good as, but no better than, any other 900 Mhz cordless phones. Watch out for Siemens mail-in rebate offers with any of its phone products. ..."
2,Worked at first :(,"I purchased this in order to turn my home phone into a voip phone, in hopes to cancel my landline service. It was a bit tricky to install, but got it up and running. Everything seemed to be working great. Then I had to unplug it in order to move it to a new location. After that, I couldn't get it to work for the life of me. Nothing else changed but unplugging it and plugging it back in. Spent hours trying to fix it, with various tech support as well. Tried a factory reset, moving it back to the original location, and everything. :( So, I ended up sending it back for a refund."
4,VoIP ATA,The product does what it claims to do well. I'm using it with my combo GrandCentral and Gizmo accounts for free calling everywhere and love it. It falls short from getting a 5 star review because it was a pain to set up and offered very little in documentation to help. Google searches came to the rescue and got me up and running after finding a well written walkthrough for a similar setup. Another slightly annoying issue I have is the firmware is only upgradeable via a windows PC and I have only macs - why not allow the firmware to be uploaded via the web interface like most of your routers linksys?
3,agreeing with product description descrepancy photo,I also have been watching this product. The only review prior was obviously for the game console itself. The product description doesn't describe what the photo depicts. If any one knows if the product actually contains the pictured ear buds and car charger please comment.
5,The BEST!,"Absolutely the BEST laptop stand on the market today. I have never had any that even compares, simply the BEST!!!!"
4,Uniqueness main selling point,"There is no other laptop stand that works as well as this, but there are a few flaws. The main problem is the bottom cushion's cover is not well fitted to the cushioning material inside. This leads to the bottom cushion needing occasional adjustment to keep it from slipping out from under the stand, even when secured by Velcro. The cushioning material and the rivets securing the top cushion also feel cheap considering the price. However, there are basically no alternatives that serve this function (and this does work very well keeping that laptop cool and me comfortable), so I am still happy with it."
4,Laptop Stand,"Materials seem to be of high quality.It functions exactly as advertised.I use it on my desk almost exclusively so I have removed the large pad from the front.The ""rubber"" buttons provided for the surface between the unit and the computer work well to hold the computer from slipping and to provide an air channel for cooling.The only slight crticism is that the hinge points, a rivit, seemed too loose to me. I tightened them on an anvil and the unit seems more soild."
4,Only cooling stand that works -- but nothing's perfect,"I tried other stands from Fellowes and Kensington and this is the only one that cuts the heat generated by my hot, hot Dell Inspiron. But it's bulky and a little heavy.It has nice gel padding underneath for that part that rests above your knees, and a gel pad in front that doubles as a wrist rest. Very comfortable once I get it on my lap.The other stands I tried were lightweight and collapsible but did little to reduce the heat.The iLap cuts the heat I would estimate by 90%, which is well above the others I tried. After a while, it feels a little heavy on my lap but then my notebook is pretty heavy by itself."
3,Slim Storage Box Clipboard,"I teach public school and I need to keep certain pieces of paperwork and writing utensils close at hand while I am walking around my classroom. The slim storage box clipboard is serving that purpose. I appreciate the fact that it is very lightweight, but I would have liked for it to have been more sturdy. I have to open and close it quite often and I am afraid the snap ends are going to break off at any moment."
5,Image of America: Tucson Arizona,"I am trying very hard to get your attention and this is the only way I know to do it. Images of America: Tucson Arizona is a great book. I know because I wrote it. I do not have such an ego that I want to review my book. However, when I type in my name as the Author --""Jane Eppinga"" it says that the Tucson book is not yet published. IT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED FOR OVER TWO MONTHS. Could someone update this information? Sincerely Jane Eppinga"
5,A great headphone for the price,"First off, let me say I'm not deaf. Well, not yet anyway.I am a big Ipod user and found the Ipod earphones really fragile and uncomfortable, but have decent sound. They also have their wires stripped, so I was looking for a cheap replacement because I do stuff when I'm using my Ipod. I bought some other cheap ones but the sound was awful. So, I bought these.The sound is decent. For headphones under $10, you can't beat them. The gumy material is much more flexible and able to withstand abuse. The earphones fit me comfortably, but like all things, YMMV. I'm able to listen with the Ipod at less than 1/4 sound without straining and maybe at 1/3 to drown out other things. Really.My point is that if you're looking for a decent replacement for your Ipod earphones without blowing a lot of money, look no further. However, if you are having trouble with earbuds fitting you or want to really drown out noise around you, go for the more expensive enclosure-type headsets. Really."
5,Good value-priced earbuds,"I bought two of these, thinking one for each ear. Nah...just kidding. I bought one for me and one for my wife. We're old folks--over 100 years old. Well, collectively, we're over a hundred. And that means the cartilage in our ears has begun to change shape and gets sensitive to foreign matter making a home inside our outer ear canals. I bought these because my wife was complaining about discomfort with a whole variety of buds. She says these seem to be the softest and most malleable for the price. Now, they're not malleable like form-fitting spongy earplugs, mind you, but they are a bit softer than the average and give way at least a little bit to the form of the ear. I haven't tried mine yet, but if her sensitive ears like it, I'm sure I will, too. I'll let you know if they don't make the cut. So far, excellent results for the price."
2,Gumy??,I do not know why they named these gumy headphones. There is nothing gumy about them except the look. They are large in size and as hard as a rock. I bought them for my 14 year old daughter and they are too big and uncomfortable. I tried them in my ears and agree. I recommend spending a little more money and getting something that is comfortable and it will sound better too.
3,Ipod novice,"Sound quality is good, but the size/shape still hurt my ears. I thought the ""gumy"" feature would help, but it doesn't."
2,"Price is right, but that's all","I thought because these are ""gumy"" headphones they would be comfortable but they are not. They hurt my ears as much as any other. If ear pain is your problem when you wear ear-buds, then don't get these."
5,Document Wedge,This is an excellent product. I use it in the kitchen to hold my recipes and in my office to hold papers on which I am working.
3,"Gets the job done, but requires patience","I travel and exercise a lot, so I needed headphones that could go from the gym bag to the carry on-bag without tangling. These are one of the only retractable sets on the market that feature workout-friendly ear hooks. They produce good sound and stay on your ears while jogging. My only complaint is that the retractable cord spring mechanism requires some patience. It sometimes fails to lock in the extended position, and sometimes unevenly spools the cord when retracting (leaving you with a bunch of unretracted cord). But usually it works okay, the headphones store easily, and the price is good. I'd recommend these as backup, travel, or workout headphones."
2,Not enough meat,I was looking for a resource to use with Pastors training in Guatemala. I chose enougher resource. It might be a good tool to use with youth in. A church setting.
3,Dissapointing printing,"The music is of course fantastic, but I was dissapointed by the quality of the printing in this volume. Sometimes note stems are virtually nonexistent, and the very small verbal instructions are almost impossible to read. The reason for this is not Dover's fault; it's because this book was printed directly from ancient master plates of the original French editions. In fact, all of Dover's ""reproductions of old French editions"" series seem to share the same problems. Yet none of Dover's German editions has the problem. Oh well, I guess all I can say is: Let the Buyer Beware."
4,Excellent resourse,As time goes by fewer and fewer people are knowledgeable concerning early aircraft so this book is an excellent resource. I have referred to it time and time again.
4,Good for the price,"I wanted a storage clipboard to keep all of our house stuff together (we are renovating a fixer-upper) - quotes, business cards, receipts, paint swatches, to-do lists, etc.Pros:Holds a lot of stuff - I can fit multiple pads of paper in there with my other stuffTray to store pencils and pensLightweightClip on front is very secureDividers on the inside of the front (though see below)Cons:The storage containers are really hard to open and close - the latches don't fit together perfectly so you have to use a lot of forceI have no use for the two on either side of the handle, and I don't need a handle, so it could be more compactThe dividers inside the front are really shallow - you can only stick one or two things in them so it doesn't help organize the contents, just keeps one or two important things separate"
3,A Changing,"A Gathering of Old Men was assigned to me by my 10th grade literature teacher. I did not think it was going to be that good but it turned out to be a good book. I thought it was good of the author not to take a side. I would have never have thought it would have been Charlie since he did let everybody hit on him. But one day he changed, he became a man and Beau happened to be there. So Charlie took it out on him. Gil, Beau's brother, Fix's son also come a man,by standing up to his father. I think the author should have told more about the whites. The end ended good with one of the whites and one of the blacks dead. Many people thought it was about racism but once I thought about it I don't think it was. It showed favor to both the whites and the blacks. They were just standing up for what they believe."
1,baaaaaad!,"This dvd is so bad that it's hard to describe all the negatives about it. It ranks right down at the bottom of the cess pool along with ""We Were in Nam"". Making movies is a concept that these people are totally out of touch with."
1,How the hell did this get released!!!?,"Keep away from this!!! Words cannot describe how BAD BAD BAD this movie is. My husband and I love watching war movies, particularly those about the Vietnam War but this one made us really angry. Not only was the script shit, the acting amateur, (seriously, a couple of five year olds could have done better), editing pathetic, camera work shaky, music hokey and the set did not like the Nam jungle one bit!! It looked more like someones unkempt back yard littered with a couple of concrete drain pipes. Drain pipes... Deep in the jungle? Yeah right. Our anger was not because of how technically inept this movie/maker was but because he made a mockery of the war and all the brave people that fought and died in it. The fact that we lost fifteen minutes of our lives watching this shite home video wasn't a pleaser either!!"
5,Jess Weber wins An Award!!,"This movies looks awsome, Jess Weber i have to say im your biggest fan keep it up, i cant wait to see you in your next film. i saw your commerical yesterday, so cool, thanks for signing my poster at the LAX airport. Aaron Summit"
5,Great scary monster---will keep you awake at night!,Liked the part where they walked through the tundra but not how the plot skips around too much
1,"Very stupid book! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone,ever!",I hated the whole stupid book! It made absolutley no sence! It just jumped from scene to scene and I didn't no where they were half the time! it was a waste of time!
1,AWFUL!!,This was the worst book I ever read. Don't read this book. Because you will think so low of R.L. Stine.P.S. I rather eat the book than read the book.
3,Average,"Jordan Blake and his sister, Nicole, has lived in the hot weather of Pasadena. They want to have a real winter with real snow to play in. Then their dream comes true. Their father has been offered a job to fly to Alaska and photograph a mysterious snow creature, known as the Abominable Snowman.Neither Jordan, his sister or his father believe that the creature is real, but it is a free trip. Almost as soon as they get to Alaska, something starts chasing them.Despite the title, the book is mostly set in Alaska. The title and the book cover actually giveaway the twisted ending. Overall, this is an average Goosebumps book."
2,"its ok,could have been more better","well the book is not up to my expectations,its about two kids who get bored down in the hot weather in their homtown and how there father a photographer takes them to alaska,and their trip turns down to an adventure"
4,"Better than some other ""sharing"" books","I've seen my share of ""sharing"" books that attempt to teach kids sharing, and this is one of the best. Unlike some ""sharing"" books that teach kids that it's OK to be selfish, this one models good behavior while at the same time showing that when the brothers are selfish, they hurt the other brother's feelings.The illustrations capture in exquisite detail the facial expressions of the children, so there is a lot more to this book than the written text. Children especially can read the subtext from the illustrations. Even small children recognize the mixture of surprise, frustration, and hurt that plays across the little brother's face as his big brother tells him he can't play with his truck."
3,Really something.,"This artist is really good.I enjoy every tune on this recording,especially,Mr.continental and mingle-mangle.Danny Federici is an excellant jazz artist.This is a definate must have for any jazz collection.It is really something."
2,There have to be better prep books than this one,"This book is riddled with typos and incorrect answers. As I read the book, I got so bothered by all the mistakes that I marked them all in red pen and am considering sending it back to the publisher (I think they should pay me for serving as the editor!). Although it did help in my prepartion by making me familiar with the format and general content of the CBEST, there have to be better books out there. Along with all the typos, there were areas, particularly in the reading section, that were not even discussed in the book. Just a tip: take the practice test on the CBEST site along with your other test prep just so you aren't caught off guard."
1,The worst lazy susan EVER!,"If you're looking for a lazy susan that turns and spins, this is NOT it! This lazy susan is cheaply and poorly made, and it doesn't do the one thing you want a lazy susan to do -- spin. I admit I purchased this particular lazy susan because it was the least expensive, and I definitely got what I paid for."
1,failed after 4 weeks,"As others have reported, hard drive failed after weeks. Computer would not boot to the sickening sound of the actuator clicking repeatedly. Will try to get replacement, but I am reluctant to lose another night's sleep getting my laptop back on the road. When it worked, it was great."
1,Choose another model!,"I also bought this camera for average holiday shots, and for my children to use. Like the previous reviewer I am also very disappointed with battery life, problems with memory card formatting, and now it refuses to switch on, even with new batteries.It is easy to use, but reliability is crucial in a camera. I see an opportunity, but the camera goes on strike, and by the time I get it on, opportunity is history.Also, there is no troubleshooting guide in the manual or the installation CD, so Vivitar must think the product is bug-free.Choose another brand, Vivitar should maybe stick to lenses."
4,"Why did you marry ME, anyway?","Why Did I Marry You Anyway is a great book for strengthening, affirming and encouraging any marriage. But don't let the title fool you - it isn't really about your spouse as much as it is about you. The title does give a great clue to the humor and approachable attitude that Bartlein carries throughout the book. In addition, she provides helpful strategies that I found useful in my own marriage. The book kept me thinking about what I can do to improve rather than what my husband could do to improve. I bought this book on a whim and have been very happy with my purchase. I plan to keep this one on my bookshelves!"
3,kirby dreamland,It was a good game but very short. Took only a couple hours to complete. Amazon did a great job shipping it to me in a timely fashion! Id use amazon again.
1,Jeans ????,"I was excited to get this movie, but then greatly disappointed when the language was foriegn even with the subtitles in English, was not a good movie. I hate spending money on a movie then it goes in the trash. There was nothing to tell me the movie was not in English, it was like a cheap, B rate one. Would not recommend it to any one in this country unless you understand the language & like the misfit pictures."
2,Tea Pot,"Cute and colorful, but stainless steel lid isn't very sturdy. I realize it needs to come off for microwaving but it doesn't stay in place very well. Feels flimsy. A ceramic lid would have been much more practical."
5,Wonderful little tea pot,Size is perfect for exactly two coffee mugs full of tea. Stainless-steel infuser is easy to keep clean and works well. Very good price for the quality. Lid is a little weak but is removable for microwaving water in the pot so it doesn't lower my rating.
4,Easy Install,"Install this upsteam of your washer then sprinkle some water on the detector plate: the little valve motor makes a whirring noise and shuts off the water. All right! In a power outage, if you installed 4 ""C"" batteries, it will still work. If you don't have a spare AC outlet, it can run on batteries alone for a year. There is a flashing LED to let you know it is working.I am no plumber, but all you need is a wrench. One of the fittings must have been out of spec because even with teflon tape I really had to (grunt) apply a lot of torque to thread it high enough to stop any leaks; always chancy because you could deform the coupling.Wire hookup is so simple you really don't need the manual. The little leak detector plates can be hooked up in series and I bought an extra one for outside the pan, just in case.The terminal box is too flimsy, and needs to be hinged, hence the loss of a star."
2,"sounds great, but cheaply made","A few months ago,$30,000.00 in water damage from a rubber hose breakage, However after seeing the floodstop and how cheap it's made, I doubt the thing would work at all,Why can't some one make one with some quality for a change"
5,Kid loves it!,Bought this to go with a bag of rocks I purchased. The kids love finding the gemstones in the book and trying to match them up to the rocks!
3,"Good for real gems, but...","I'm a new beader, and while this is a beautiful book, many of the stones I buy are not listed when I look them up in the color-code index. My hopes were that when I forgot what the stone was called, or wanted more info to tell my customers, I could find it. There are so many color variations and so many semi-precious gemstones being made into beads, it may be impossible to have a total reference book. It is a great source for those gems listed, and it may be more geared toward rockhounds."
4,Smithsonian Handboodk,It was bought has a gift. My friend wanted to know about gemstones and thishit the nail on the head. She found it very informative.
4,An excellent psychological thriller,"I have just recently discovered the extremely talented and prolific writer Joyce Carol Oates. Currently, I have read three of her novels,MAN CRAZY, BROKE HEART BLUES and DOUBLE DELIGHT. Her writing style is always interesting, but at times, unpredictable, and while some of her novels are conventional, others are more free-style and sometimes difficult to get through. DOUBLE DELIGHT, written under the pseudonym of Rosamond Smith, is one of her more conventional novels, an intricately plotted, psychological thriller that keeps you always guessing. A story of seduction, sexual obsession and deception, that drives an ordinary, upstanding man, Terrence Greene to commit extraordinary crimes in the name of passion. DOUBLE DELIGHT is an excellent book for the JCO novice to begin with. She is a wonderful writer, one of the masters of the psychological suspense genre."
1,It's a destroyer,"This item destroyed my hard drive data. Installed and it messed up and distorted my video. Removed and reinstalled into a different PCI slot, booted up and all I got was the blue screen. Removed this obviously defective TV card and my PC would not boot. I had to reinstall my operating system and all my programs. A huge pain and hassle. Returned card to Amazon. They immediately credited my credit card $9.65 (for return shipping), THEN Amazon had the temerity and gall to deduct the $9.65 from the credit, (originally $88.99) and refunded me $79.34. For a defective item. Mr. Amazon - for less than 10 bucks you permanently lost a customer - Bye Amazon!"
2,"HDTV watch only, analog TV burns to dvd","As the other reviewers have said, this product has good to great hardware and very poor software. The tuner is very good, especially for HDTV, but the recorder software fair for analog TV only and it is useless for HDTV. The two are just not matched up to work together. The recorder software is a stripped out trial version of Corel's ""Ulead MovieFactory 5"". A free trial version of ""Ulead MovieFactory 6"" is still available on the www.corel.com website.The selection of pci tuner cards is limited.I had been using an older TV tuner card and old DVR software in my pc to record favorite TV shows and movies, edit out the commercials, and burn to dvd. I purchased this new tuner to upgrade to HDTV, but it's not capable of doing the same off broadcast HDTV. I'm better-off using my old setup on analog cable tv."
3,Nice product hard to configure.,It does what it needs to do but the description is misleading.This is not for digital cable but rather for QAM only (HD signals).It was confusing how to set it up with BeyodTV product but there are very good forum out there that helps.If anyone wants a card for digital cable - please note that most channels on digital cable are SDV (Switch demand Video) and this card does not support that.It is very hard to configure the QAM channels and gives very little benefit.
3,It works but..........,"I thought I can get QAM also the Win TV scheduler is not working but otherwise, it is a good product and I am pretty happy with it."
5,Great Story!,"This book I could not put down -- What a story!!! Marconi's name is famous, of course, but I never knew what a social bonehead he was. Not somebody I would want to know, even though I've had a life-long interest in radio. And Hawley Crippen, someone I'd never heard of, was a fascinating character.I liked this book better than Devil in the White City, actually."
3,Not the Devil in the White City,"Larson has become formulaic after only two books. Neither story intrigued me, and I just wanted to get through it and move on."
1,Not worth the effort,"Larson takes forever to get to the story, which is a stretched point, at best. He spends way too much time on painstaking details for setup, most of which go nowhere, and very little time fleshing out the climax of the story, which he fairly breezes over. Haven't read his other book, but judging by this effort, the man does not know how to tell a story. Painfully and woefully disappointed! Hours of my life I'll never get back again."
1,Won't Be Reading the Rest of This!,"I was excited to read this book, but wait! A book about Marconi's wireless? I do believe that Tesla was awarded the patent ahead of Marconi and any book about Marconi's success just makes me mad. Can't enjoy the rest of the book."
1,Not Accurate,"I believe Mr. Larson needs to research the history of wireless transmission. It was N. Tesla who invented the radio, not Marconi. When the courts were through with Marconis challenge to Tesla, it was Tesla who was awarded the recognition as the inventor. This book is a work of fiction, not non-fiction."
3,The stories within stories get laborious and boring,"I'll echo other reviews -- I had high expectations after reading other Larsen books. But, the text lost steam less than a 1/3 into the book, only to regain energy near the end. At times I felt like the story line had the excitement (and feel) of my college science textbooks 20 y ago --> boring! I'd only give it 2 stars, except he gets one extra star for effort!"
3,thunderstruck review,The history is excellent. I enjoyed learning about the beginning of wireless and about the competition to be the first to accomplish. The murder part was okay. Interesting though how the wireless enabled the killer to be apprehended. I found there were too many confusing characters but I muddled through. Good read in the end. Felt the same about The Devil and the White City. Enjoyed but somewhat confusing in beginning. Loved In the Garden of Beasts. Good read all around.
2,Not up to Par...,Larson is going down hill. Isaac's Storm was fabulous... his other titles pale in comparison.
4,Marconi/Murder Mix,"I enjoyed the unabridged audio book version of Thunderstruck read by the actor Bob Balaban, although I couldn't honestly say if it would hold my interest as much in print. Balaban has a pleasant, yet flat, delivery that does not distract from the narrative. This, the author's second book in which he utilizes a formula of juxtaposition - where two seemingly unrelated bits of history, one sensational, the other pivotal in scientific advancement, find a unifying thread - might pigeonhole Larson into this sub-genre of his own device. Since, for me, plain dry facts of history or science tend not to hold my attention for too long, I sincerely hope this style blossoms, not only from Larson but from other history writers hoping to actually make some serious money from their long hours of tedious research by squeezing just a tincture of creative pulp into their work. Who says History can't drop a dose of the good stuff and shake its booty now and then?"
4,A Painless Way to History,"I was so impressed after I read Devil in the White City, that I bought the HC edition of Thunderstruck to enjoy another good read. Well, while I did enjoy portions of this book, it was not as compelling as White City.This book tells the story of Marconi's development of the wireless telegraph, along with the life of a man who murdered his wife and took a lover. In ""Devil"", both stories were equally compelling...the historic event and the opposing evil doings. In this book, there was too much detail on the development of the wireless, and not enough on the doctor/murderer. While I enjoyed learning all the details on wireless development I wish the author had included more on the doctor's life."
4,"Larson tries to recapture magic of Devil in the White City, mostly succeeds","This book's twin storylines is a heavy-handed throwback to the style of the wildly successful Devil in the White City. If you enjoyed Devil, you will also find much to like in Thunderstruck. However the connection between the two engaging stories does not become apparent until late in the book after several hundred pages the lack cohesiveness."
2,Dangerously Boring~,"Leave written documentation that you are sitting down with ""Thunderstruck"" before doing so - that way your heirs will be able to sue the author after finding that you died of boredom.""Thunderstruck"" weaves two stories together - one of the development of wireless communication by Marconi (a physics mystery, best left to physicists), and the other the bizarre murder of a nerdy physician's unfaithful wife, by the physician. The connection is that Marconi's invention was used in tracking/following the murderer and his lover across the Atlantic.Somehow I survived reading ""Thunderstruck;"" however, I recommend that you don't take the risk. The physician's weapon was poisoning by cyanide; Larsen's is brain suffocation via far too many irrelevant details."
3,it was a decent read,"I liked this book. That said, I didn't love this book. The main character is likeable, and behaves in a manner true to her age. It seems to me that some of the other characters were templates, and bordered on stereotypes. The mother is Melanie, straight off of the plantation, and the black housewoman will definitely have you thinking that Annie lives at Tara. Annie loses a potential suitor, a young boy as sweet as Scarlett's first husband. The story is not Gone With The Wind, but you will hear echoes of Mitchell while you read it."
3,Pretty okay book...,"This book was okay for me. I found the synoposis to be really off. Only about half of it had anything to do with Annie's romance with the Northern soldier, and it wasn't well developed at all. If you like reading about war strategies and locations, pick it up! But don't read it for the romance. I couldn't say I would read this book again."
4,"An introduction, but not for the real novice","""Short and to the point"" describes the book perfectly, but what is the point? More specifically, to whom is it introducing the subject.I found the book a good description of the logic behind choice theory; on what are the numerous different bases on which we can build a ""theory"" of choice; and where this can lead. From the simplest ideas of choice we are led to Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and so can see that ""rational"" choices may not satisfy everyone in a democracy - a result that needs to be known at all levels of a polity.However it's supposed to be an introduction. If you're someone not used to using logic there are too many slippery areas where you'll get lost, even though the author tries to ground the work in reality - sometimes successfully, sometimes not. And for someone who wants to see more of the practical implications it is a pity that these are not explicated more.This book will suit some as an introduction, but not all."
1,Chewing rubber would fascinate me more!,"I think that if you are thinking of buying this book think again. I was expecting narratives that would capture me. I was expecting to get to know each character...but that was not to be the case. It was a very matter of fact overview of each person's case. It did not do a good job into gving insight in each character neither did it do a good job in giving me any useful information on the medical side of HIV, therefore it was useful for absolutely... nothing.I feel as though I cannot even articulate how disappointed I was by this book. I didn't even bother reading the last ten pages because it was not worth it. All the characters were similar, and all the stories were bland. thats all I can say...Dont waste your time or money!!!"
1,Not worth the price -- design problem -- 0 stars,"I bought an iLap and at first was delighted. But I soon discovered that the cloth cushion was held on only by simple rubber cement! The heat of the laptop causes the cement to melt, and the pillow simply came off -- useless. The sticky residue remains, making it difficult to use without the cushion. Attempts to contact customer service by phone or email were ignored. I had to conclude that not only was the product inferior, but the company was not acting in good faith."
5,Very Pleased with Guess Gold,"Tried out Guess Silver and Guess Gold at Ulta. Gold won out for me. I love the warm vanilla that comes out. Definitely a great fall to winter fragrance, but can be worn anytime. It is unlike anything I own and is a fruity, spicy, slightly musky vanilla. Very beautiful and interesting to me that it is not that well known. I have had it for almost five years and the smell is just as fresh as when I first bought it. Such a high quality fragrance and mine was the big bottle and came in a nice purple drawstring bag. I use it sparingly because it can get too strong if over applied. I like to alternate this with L'occitane Cherry Blossoms and Lacoste Touch of Pink for a nice change up."
2,you can never go home again...,"Although the title of a book;it pretty much sums up this effort. A very flat,underwritten,overly produced failure that does not come close to ever capturing the energy of the old Rufus and Chaka Khan recordings. Some songs were boring while a few were almost painful to listen to-so much so I did not make it through to the final track.If this was an effort to raise funds for a foundation; fine, my money was well spent,if not...you may want to think about spending yours."
4,To Chkaka Khan`s devoted fans,"This new and long waited CD of Chaka Khan is something to her devoted fans. Her vocals sound as good as her "" Masterjam ""times in the 80`s.I was not very thrilled to featured artists like Michael Mcdonald or Mary J. Blige because they don`t support overall impression.But I like Chaka and her style. Good music. One of her best albums, I think."
3,"""will you love me?""","I have been a Chaka Khan fan since her days with Rufus. I believe this song catches the essence of Chaka's voice. I also like her remake of pack my bags and the song with Michael McDonald. The cover of Prince's song ""sign of the times"" wasn't bad, but I can skip that one.RobinNewark, NJ"
5,Good product,This product worked fine in our Nutone central Vac system and we saved considerable money by buying an off brand. Would buy again.
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,"For months, my hair was oily within an hour of washing. it was frustrating using product after product that did not work. This product helped along with using warm water not hot water. Though cold weather makes you want use hot water, but it was making my oily hair worse. So I keep the water hot until its time to wash and rinse my hair. I can't believe my oily hair problem has much improved."
5,Great speakers,"First off, they have diffrent name then on my box- mine are Bx3. Everything looks the same though. These speakers CRANK! Crystal clear on all notes, ballsy base for audio and games. UT2004 is a blast to play now, Doom3 + reserection becomes more intense with these speakers. All around, beats the hell outas my creative labs set. For the price (24.88 at walmart) they sure as hell give you more for your buck. the plug and play also is great! works with PSP using an adapter jack"
4,Sounds good for the money,Wires are too short...could not get the desired separation of the sattelites. Sounds good enough though.
5,Boutros Finds This Book Dope,Boutros-Boutros gives this esteemed tome TWO BIG thumbs up on the Chachometer. A must-have for your bookshelf. Don't be a Sea Monkey...Big up yourself and buy it.
5,Wonderful Album!,"Billy Gibson is simply one of the greatest harmonica players of this generation. He has had a great career thus far, and will continue to meet musical heights with his subsequent projects, both live and recorded. While in Mississippi, he had a group called the ""Mindbenders"" with himself on the harmonica and vocals, Mike Butts on Bass, Geoff Thornton on Drums, and Scott Miller on Guitar (see Scott Miller's bestselling ""Getting Into Jazz Fusion Guitar"" by Mel Bay Publications at this site). The band was one of the greatest bands in Ms., and opened shows for B.B. King et. al., and performed at the prestigious Delta Blues Festival. Check out Gibson on this fine outing."
4,great game!,"this is s great game if you like adventure games! There are tons of levels and the graphics sre great considering its a game boy game. You won't get bored quickly like a lot of games. There are a lot of different kinds of levels, so the game isn't too repetitive. If you like the donkey kong country games for the SNES or any other good side- scrolling adventure game you will love this game!"
2,So pretty but not for long!,"This is such a pretty ring. Received it quickly and love how it sparkles. However, at least one stone is rattling around in it's setting. It's just a matter of time before it comes out. The 30-day return policy (needs to be IN THEIR HANDS before 30 days are up from time of purchase) just doesn't cut it. So attractive but just not well-made. You buy cheap - you get cheap."
2,Inaccurate and worse....,"This BP monitor is accurate -- and mine stopped working after a few months. Although they replaced it with a new one, I purcahse a different one anyway. I can't really complain though since I used a coupon from UnderTag.com, so it was almost free for me."
5,Delivers what it promises,"As the cover says, this dictionary is for travelers and beginners of Cantonese, so the focus is on daily and useful expressions. The Cantonese-English part is arranged alphabetically using the Yale romanization, so no knowledge of Chinese characters is required. The definitions are short and clear.The only problem is that the author favors more formal expressions. For example, if a certain verb has a colloquial/slang variant that is used by most Cantonese speakers in daily life and a more formal variant that is used in both spoken Cantonese and written Chinese, the author selects the latter.Nevertheless, I find this dictionary extremely useful."
5,Kings are the best,Ive been playing soccer my whole life through college and Id have to say that Puma Kings are the best shoes Ive ever owned. I do have wider feet and Puma's definetly are wider shoes. I've never found a Nike or Addidas shoe that compares. Kings are the best.
4,"Emphasis on ""shoe leather"" reporting","Using this text for an advanced newswriting course, I like its emphasis on ""shoe leather"" reporting. My entering students have learned the basics of newswriting skills but not necessarily the vigor of pursuing a story with many dimensions.A proliferation of examples produces not only sample news stories but a running account from myriad reporters portraying both their curiosity and persistance in pursuing a story.Another strength of the text is its coverage of the way reporters in different media struggle to draft a story. With students in communication classes fuzzy about where they will ""land""--in print, radio, TV, or electronic reporting--the multiple viewpoints are relevant.Teaching from this highly current book, I applaud these features in each chapter:integration of law/ethical issuessummary boxesexercises and assignmentsuse of databases and computer-assisted reporting"
2,A very bad buy,"I bought this printer a year ago and after 1 month it ran out of an ink, after i replaced it, it ran out of it again.I only printed about 100 pages. Printing quality is miserable. My advice to you is spent 100 dollars more and buy a quality Epson printer."
2,Unhappy,I am still waiting for my Csnon Printer. He said he ship it once butthey could not find me. The second time he ship it thru the US PostOffice around Sep. 2. 03 and so far I havent seen my printer yet.
3,"Apollo Suntouch + 10,000 LUX Light Therapy","Product works as specified, however, it is so bright my eyes hurt. No way to shield my eyes from direct view, so I turn it to face the wall. Not satisfied with this design. Wish I'd spent the $350+ for the lamp that tilts, I have one of those at my office and love it. PS, light therapy has saved my bacon every winter. Now I need it to re-tune my Circadian Cycle so I can fall asleep and wake up when I need to."
2,Sun light,"This light has made me a happier and more energetic person when I use it in the morning for about 20 minutes or less. Using it 30 minutes makes me way too hyper and way too happy. The only thing I am dissatisfied with is I was expecting a full-spectrum light which my doctor prescribed and this is a blue light which are not as effective but are less expensive. When I did a Google search for full-spectrum this light came up and when it came the description says it is a blue light. So that's the only negative. I like the ion part, it makes my house smell like a waterfall which is pretty cool. I use it as a light behind my makeup mirror so now I have taken more time to pamper myself in the morning when I am getting ready for the day so that's actually a positive, pampering oneself is always a nice ego booster."
5,Good Product,"I have had the light for several weeks, and have noticed improvements in my mood. I need to use it more, and have recommended it to a friend who also needs it. Not quite like summer, but it sure helps."
3,Decent,"The Ion feature shuts off the light after a few minutes, but if you are just using the light it works well."
5,A Big Help to Get Started,"I have had some experience with Photoshop and Photoshop Elements, but none in Premiere. Photoshop has several new features I had not used previously. The book was great at getting me started on a new project to put together a DVD of our church's high schools grads and their family pictures, along with audio. The book includes a disk containing all the lesson materials, showing how the final product should look prior to walking you through on how to get to that final product. It does not cover all of the features of each program, but is great at getting you started and familiarizing yourself with the program interfaces."
2,making DVD slide shows with photoshop elements 4 & premiere 2,"After numerous hours attemting to make DVD slide shows with Photoshop elemnts 4.0 and Premiere 2.0, I have given up for now.It appears that my Windows Xp media center has a problem preventing this particular use of the application to work.Adobe support was unable to solve the problem without a complete reinstall of Windows.Otherwise I like Photoshop elements 4.0"
2,stereo headphone adapter for Treo 650,"Primary use case is for listening to music on airplane flights, with the mobile phone radio off. Connection to Palm Treo 650 requires quite a bit of force. The electrical signal connection is spotty, but fiddling a bit gets the earphone output working consistently."
5,I Love This Book!,"I'm an avid reader of different types of books. Prior to reading Sympathy for the Devil, James Patterson was my favorite mystery/thriller author. Christopher Chambers has taken his place. What a great book! Mr. Chambers grabs your attention in the very beginning and holds it throughout the entire book. (...) [Mr. Chambers,] I can't wait for your next book. You have a devoted fan in me!"
1,Not very clear on the subject just cute drawings...,"This book doesn't explain any ""hard stff"" very well.A goal of Wilmott's book is to ""gently"" introduce Quantitative finance, derivatives and their pricing, to non-math majors.Wilmott puts cute drawings to help the reader feel the subject matter is not so scary, but I need the simplest clearestwritting possible and many simple(as possible) examples, not just cute pictures.In his chapter that introduces PDE's , Wilmott starts talking ""engineer ease"" within the first few sentences, and Iassume Wilmott thinks he is being clear to the non-quant reader. Wrong! The chapter has too much jargon.The book doesn't go too deep into math, but it's still notclear on the material it attempts to explain.However, the CD has some nice Excel examples on pricing,provided you are already familiar with the pricing models used.Wilmott, has several books on Finance, but many of them arejust repeats of his earlier books but with some chapters taken out!..."
1,Old Material,"This is recycled Wilmott, but not even as good as earlier work. His first book was better, probably because his co-authors talked some sense into him. His personal anecdotes demonstrate a low emotional IQ. It is as if Wilmott thinks that if readers agree with the finance they must agree with his incessant and juvenile self-regard. My reaction to the inappropriate self-expose was: ""Who cares? Get some friends, they might help on the financial aspects of this book"".Wilmott's financial IQ is only average, if this book is to be the evidence. It seems Wilmott isn't up on the latest techniques, or can't be bothered to research them. Stochastic calculus for example. Lack of real world practical examples demonstrates lack of knowledge of how financial instruments work in practice."
1,Wilmott is no Feynman,"I own a copy of Wilmott's ""Derivatives"", which I find to be a useful, if somewhat superficial, reference for a wide variety of financial problems. It was worth buying. In his new opus, Wilmott makes an obvious attempt to copy the style and insight of ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"". However, Wilmott falls rather short, and cannot deliver anything beyond what is in his previous books. Forget the boxed set and fancy signature, and stick with the previous book."
1,Just buy the Derivatives book,"I was hoping for something more than the derivatives book. I was really disappointed. Not only it is mostly repeating the other book. It is even less detailed. I love Paul Wilmott's books.. However, this last one you can do without.. Just buy the derivatives the theory and practice book and you will be happy you did. I am sending this one back...I was really hoping for more Juice from Wilmott.."
5,this is not a toy.,"Hello,this is one of the most useful things you can purchase for your spa.I wouldnt' be without it."
4,Useful for Spa's,"I didn't want a monstrous cleaner for my 4 person spa. This works out well and is pretty easy to handle. The suction tip seems to slip off a lot but I didn't really need to use it after all. A good buy and is small enough to store out of sight. It got the sand, rocks and bugs off the bottom of the Jacuzzi which was my pet peeve. Over all, a pretty good investment. P.S., the rating system is for 'A Toy' and this of course is not a toy so over all I give this a 4."
3,Spa vacuum,"It works well on my three person hot tub/spa. Extremely easy to put together and use - works well for getting the grit off of the bottom of the spa so it's nice and smooth when in use. Easy, slow pumping action creates just the right amount of suction to pick up the grit - super easy.Update: This lasted just over one year, with three repairs requiring PVC glue during that time. It's over-priced for the quality."
4,Good deal!,This book has great photographs with several different angles to demonstrate postures. Great book for a beginner or for someone looking to put together a practice for themselves at home.
5,Excellent Book,"This is my wife's purchase. She conducts yoga class twice a week, and has been a practitioner for several years. She says this is a valuable reference."
3,Size matters,"This is an impressive, big book by Mr. Iyengar himself, but the much smaller ""Yoga: The Iyenger Way"" by Mehta is better. This book lacks cross-references but instead shows the same poses in different parts of the book. It also shows the poses for various ailments, while the Mehta book simply lists them with a page reference. In other words, this book is so much bigger than others not because it offers more but because it's inefficiently organized."
4,Laughable insights into the life of a non-Presidential dog.,"This is a funny book about an average dog and his life. Mickey judges people and other animals by how well they play ball. Not a bad rule of thumb- or claw- so to speak. It's also the first time we've had a view of a dog's life that wasn't from a Presidential, White House viewpoint. We got it as a gift and enjoyed it."
4,A must for Boston owners and good fun for the rest of us.,"Dogs have interior lives. Some have satisfying interior lives, or so Mrs. Nock, writing as Mickie, leads the reader to believe. Mickie's ""thoughts"" are faithfully recorded as he leads a life of small adventures with his consort Winnie, his family, and assorted four legged creatures in the bayside town which he calls home. His monologue is soothing, simple, and charming. Good fun for the whole family. Two thumbs up!"
3,Ok,"Not what I needed, too lengthy for first graders. I did use some of its pictures and information. Oh we'll new book for the library."
3,A great solution for disc storage,"Bought this case to reduce the space eaten up by my dvd's. It's worked great to accomplish it's task. Looks nice too! Don't expect top quality though, the one I received had multiple stitching defects. I suppose that's to be expected with the relatively low price tag. Keep in mind: extra sleeves can be expensive - almost too expensive, so weigh that into your purchasing decision."
4,"Ah, nastalgia.","I've played this game int eh past and it was fun to revisit it, even if it was short as compared to most fo the others one to be had. I like the game simply for its replayability and seeking of missing parts, if any."
1,not worth a penny,"This is simply a new page for an old product with too many bad reviews. Notice that all the good reviews sound kind of the same. (Yes, there are people who get paid to make verified purchases and write good reviews.) Don't buy this robe; it will fall apart after one or two washings."
3,VERY basic device,"Absolutely no frills here. No timers. No permanent filter. Just a simple drip pot. Overall, it is well made for it's price and does brew a good cup of coffee. The only coplaint I have is that the lip of the curaffe has a bad tendency to drip on the first cup being poured when you brea a really full pot. Since this is only a 5 cup (read 5 as 3 to anyone who acutally fills his cup) You almost always make a full pot."
2,"Started strong, now dripping","When I first bought this 5-cup coffee maker, I was so thrilled I purchased 2 more as gifts. It's just 6 months later, and all 3 of us are experiencing hot water and some coffee liquid falling outside the carafe. I'm disappointed in this brand, which I trusted. Looking more closely inside, the poor design which houses the filter holder is the issue. I won't be buying another B&D again."
2,average quality + poor heat protection,"I expect higher quality at this price point. These gloves are appropriate for handling items near a heat source, but NOT for handling items that have already been exposed to that heat source; i.e. these gloves are good for putting logs into a stove but not for repositioning logs within the stove. I purchased these to use with a smoker and they do not provide sufficient heat protection to allow me to open a cast iron smoke box lid long enough to add more wood."
4,"Exactly what I needed, but stiching was different color","The gloves were exactly what we were looking for my husband as he uses our wood burning stove. My only problem with them is the Ox and G&F were stitched in (of all colors) PINK rather than the orange that seems to show. Not a huge problem, but it sort of takes away from the ""manly"" nature of them for my husband."
1,Poorly constructed - Minimal heat protection,"I've owned these for some time.The inner lining starting coming apart after the second use.They only provide minimal heat protection for a very short period of time. I would say less than 60 seconds.They are good for handling firewood or feeding the firebox on my smoker.If I need to handle anything hot off the grill, I switch to my G & F Exclusive Extra Long Cuff Oven Gloves-made of Dupont Nomex & Kevlar-withstands Heat up to 480 Degrees Fahrenheit."
4,Sixty thousand Angels....Now enroute to TOKYO?,"I rated this Book 4 stars consider 5 if by the time you read this Sixty Seconds has become an Epitaph. Fine book, goes hand in hand with Late Night Radio ;-).....But in all seriuosness Mr Hadfield is building a dire scenario of what is more than just a dam good possibility. Look where the Island of Japan sits...on/at the convergence of several techtonic plates. In comparison, the Kobey EQ will be a walk in the Park...The aftermath of Financial Wreckage & Ruin would/will change the World Forever. Think not that we all off the hook, we still live on the brink of Edgar Cayce <the End of 1999 Great Earthchanges unlike ever seen> and Michelle de Nostradamus....<In April the Earth will tremble badly> What about that generated Tsunami...? Prehaps time to get that board ready....Surf's up Dudes!"
4,Folligen stops skin inflammation and flaking,"Hi All,I am an Indian Male with pattern baldness. My hair loss problem started in my early twenties and continuing till date - am 28 now.I read about the folligen spray and found that the product had a greater positive review and decided to try it.I use it every alternate night and shampoo it off in the morning. With the use of folligen, the itching, flaking and the skin inflammation I have been suffering from disappeared. I havent grown new hair and any progress of hair growth is slow, but I will recommend it to anyone with itching,flaking and inflammation in the scalp. Folligen has definitely relieved me of those symptoms.I am continuing the use of it to keep the results. Folligen with Minoxidil and a decent moisturizing shampoo must help your hair fall if you are in the initial stages of hair loss."
4,Nice Folding Music Stand,"A prompt delivery. The stand was sent well protected and arrived in perfect conditions. It is light, easy to manage and big enough to put on it big scores."
5,Works great!!,"These worked great, and they are so easy to use. Just make sure you follow the directions, and they stay in the correct place."
4,A Psychonaut's Guide to the Invisible Landscape,I found the book to be quite interesting although scary at times to realize that the author was willing to leave his ego behind in search of the spiritual world and the inner workings of the mind. It was fascinating to read of his journey. DXM is found it cough syrups but the author used it in a powdered form which makes it seem a more logical way to use it if a person is so inclined to do it for exploration. The previous sentence is in response to the last person's review.
3,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this CD. Too many abstractions and cheesy statements (""Put your oars in the water""). Background music distracting."
5,Great for a starting place on the subect. All Biblical.,Our Sunday school class used this as a text book for a deeper study on the Trinity. It is easy to read and understand- Provides very good info on the subject and is 100% backed by scripture. A great study!
3,Perfect for Spiderwick Collectors and Children,"If you must have everything-Spiderwick, you must have this Field Guide. A collector's item for adults, and a tangible extension of the those story-things otherwise only imagined. 2-Stars for Novelty. Another star for Design. Had the quality of the binding and paper been a bit better a fourth star would have been in order. And finally, the price is now too high for a fifth star."
5,great field guide,"THis is awesome, and I wish that I had it before I read the books, but I just re-read them all after reading through this beautifully detailed guide. =)"
1,gift for grandson,i have no idea about this product as it was a gift for my grandson and I haven't read it.
1,disbelief,"I purchased this book to study for the nclex-rn. by the time i made it to page twenty i found several spelling and grammar mistakes. i sent an email to the publisher, who notified me that there were also mistakes with the answers in the test questions. was this book ever edited? needless to say i promptly returned this book and got my money back. i don't recommend that anybody buy this book. i can't beleive that bookstores would even sell this book."
5,Great for a small group,"This is a great book. My friend and I used it when we led a college age small group. We had people that had been in church all their lives, as well as people who were either new christians or just interested, and this book was able to give something to everyone. It is very easy to understand, practical, and soundly based in the Bible. I very highly reccomend it!"
2,gay content my ass!!,"i'm trying to remember where i heard that this book had gay characters in it...i can't even remember. but i know i heard that from somebody, and it's just soooooo not true. aside from some light (very light) homoeroticism, there's nothing in that respect at all! and besides that, it's a pretty bad read....although some of the dialog is feakin' hilarious. i mean so incredibly bad that its just funny at times. (funny in a bad way though...) but anyway, my whole point was, if you're like me and you like fantasy with gay characters and you heard that this book had, in fact, gay characters in it, then know that the person or persons who told this to you....ARE LYING!!!! as a matter of fact they DRIP WITH DECEIT!!!! CURSE THEM ALL!!!!!"
5,It changed my life,"I started on this way of eating a year ago February. Every one on my Mother's side of the family are large people. I have tried every diet that was ever made and nothing worked. I have lost over 25 lbs and keep it off , since last Feb 99. I will stay on this the rest of my life. I have showed this to other people and they are on this also. I am a farm girl and used to eating bacon and eggs foe breakfast, although i eat other thing also. My Husband in on this also and loves it. If i can eat any thing i want once a day for a meal, i think that it is great. I drink lot's of water and don't get hungary anymore. Thanks for giving ud something that we can live with. A KY Farm Girl. Mae Fulkerson"
2,Not the greatest,"The receiver seems to work sometimes, but not as well as some other GPS models that are not part of a PDA. It's also pretty difficult to figure out. The help files are on a PC, not on the PDA. I'm not happy about buying this."
4,seller true to word; good service,"Bought this as a gift for my great nephew's arrival. It was sent directly to him but was not working. When the recipients contacted the seller, the item was replaced quickly and without any hassle for a new, working item. Very pleased with the exceptional service."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD has been produced WITHOUT RP's permission or knowledge. I am disgusted that Amazon, which I thought was a credible source that only sold legitimate products, is selling this. I bought the DVD without knowing any of this, and immediately called Amazon and asked for a FULL refund (not a partial refund like they tried to give me initially)."
1,Russell Peters is Hilarious . . . but this DVD is no laughing matter,"Russell Peters is without a doubt one of the funniest mainstream comedians around; if you agree with this statement at all do not buy this DVD. Not only is this an unlicensed DVD (that's right, Peters' permission was never given, if you ever go to one of his stand up shows he makes sure to mention it) but it looks like some 11 year child manufactured it using a dot matrix printer. The CD looks like something that was labeled using a ""CD Stomper"" and the cover for the case is such poor quality that you can almost see the pixels in the Amazon pictures. The DVD itself is shoddily done, and overall looks like a two dollar production (or less).If you are fan at all of Russell Peters, show support and buy the licensed DVD, not this rip off piece of garbage. I am disgusted that I didn't know sooner and actually purchased one of these DVDs."
1,Junk,"The text in this book is so small it is impossible to read. It looks like the copying machine used to print this book wasn't the best. All the pictires are difficult to make out the subject. This book is not worth the paper it was printed on. I expected something like ""eye in the sky"" type of book. I would not recommend this paperback book to anyone interested in this subject."
2,The CIA Provides This Identical Publication Online for Free!,"There isn't much to add to what previous reviewers have said - this is good first-hand archival material about the U.S.'s early satellite surveillance program - the Corona. The two-star rating isn't because the material is not good, but to call attention to the fact that it need not be bought - the identical publication is provided online for free by the CIA under the title ""Corona: Between the Sun and the Earth."" I can't provide a link, but a Google search should turn it up without problem."
5,she's done it again,"Watase has made another incredible series. Ceres has a much darker story and heavier drama than Fushigi Yuugi, but it still keeps those silly Watase moments that FY had. Ceres is a MUST SEE SERIES FOR WATASE FANS AS WELL AS SHOJO ANIME FANS!!! Watase has not lost her creative touch a bit with Ceres. The animation is great (is it just me or does it look exactly like the FY OVA animation?) and the voice acting is top notch, as usual."
4,Beware of Home Equity Loans & the AMT,"This is a great tax prep product (I have not tried other s/w, so my opinion may not mean much to you). I did have one problem w/ the tax-year 2000 version: we got a home equity loan and used the proceeds to purchase a car. TT did not ask me what each mortgage interest amount was for. Taxpayers must complete Form 6251 (which determines whether or not AMT must be paid) if they deduct mort. interest in which the loan proceeds are used for something other than a house. As result, my return did not have this form. In 2001 I saw this error but (I think ?) I'm ok b/c the tax amounts (rebate) did not change when I used Form 6251."
2,miserable to load and reload...,"I installed the ""personalized"" version that they sent me in the mail as a past user... you had to either log into the website to purchase or purchase over the phone... I made the mistake of purchasing over the phone, then could not get it to install, it wanted to constantly re-direct me to the website and have me re-purchase it (again). Was able to access on-line support OK, but they didn't have a clue what I was talking about. Called the 800 number, they got me going, but when I went to re-install on my laptop, same problem, had to call the 800 number back for instructions to re-load. (800 number only open 9-5 weekdays, not when I work on my taxes) Works great when you get it installed, but miserable to install. Ordered State disc, that installed no problem, worked fine. Wish they'd go back to ""buy it off the shelf, put the disc in, load it and do your Taxes""."
5,Absolutely the BEST tax preparation software available!,"Is there ANY other way to prepare your taxes quickly, accurately, and easily? I don't think so. I've been using this product line from the beginning.Use Quicken and make full use of categorized transactions and you'll have your 1040 and supporting schedules completed before that mp3 finishes downloading."
3,Weak spot in middle canister,"I bought this set of canisters in September 2009, and have been using them ever since. They look really nice, but the middle one apparently had a weak or thin spot, and when it accidentally tapped against another canister it cracked and broke. I am very disappointed, because I had to throw it away."
5,Great Book,"Very readable and fun review of wines and the wine experience. Not overloaded with minutia, but packed with information. Lots of practical information."
5,The cleaning machine,"This I the best vaccum cleaner I have ever owned. Its light and very powerful. Don't be fooled by the amps. Has two motors, one is for the brush. The brush is so strong that it pulls the vaccum cleaner. It also has a washable filter. This is a great vaccum if you live in a home with pet and have wood floors. You can find it cheeper at other stores. (BB&B)."
1,Misleading,"For someone starting out learning Japanese, I thought this book would be helpful....well, little did I know that there is a system which already exists where in you learn the ""parts"" of kanji (radicals)...and why bother to learn these when you're going to need to learn radicals anyway?It's a pointless book and a waste of money."
2,"skip the Belkin, you can do better..","I bought at Best Buy for $39.99 but later exchanged for something else; this Belkin had some annoying quirks...:-USB wouldn't recognized on bootup/restart sometimes, had to unplug/replug USB.-sometimes would roam around and connect to neighbors' wireless networks!-the Belkin Wireless Monitor Utility isn't very useful, doesn't allow you to specify a default network.-Belkin support website only had a PDF manual, and 2 Belkin Monitor Utilities for download: version 4000, and regular? doesn't describe any further. No drivers or firmware available.I'm running Windows XP Pro SP2, all updates.I exchanged for a D-Link WUA-1340 ($39.99). Works, with none of the annoying quirks that the Belkin had."
4,"works well, wish it had better range...","I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price."
2,Wont work on some PCs,"bought 2 of these and have tried to get them to work on 3 different WinXP PCs and laptops, so far only one PC works with it, but will only work when it it is installed in the exact same usb port as it was when software was installed, if I move it to another USB port on the same PC it will not work. Other 2 PCs would not work at all with this device, installation finishes and the device shows a yellow 'cannot start' status in Windows hardware device manager."
2,Can't get it to work on an iBook or PowerBook,"I tried all the workarounds and terminal setting patches described by other reviewers. None worked for me on either an iBook or PowerBook (yes, the internal airport cards fail and are too expensive to replace). I wonder why it's so hard for Belkin to write a driver for Macs."
1,Would not recommend to worst enemy!,"This product is a piece of junk. Setup was amazingly difficult (definitely not a ""plug 'n play"" device) - it was impossible to connect despite the wireless connection status saying ""connected"". After I finally got it working because apparently the Belkin connectivity utility requests a Hex key for the network password instead of the actual passphrase, it loses signal every 5 minutes or so - NOT exaggerating. The router is in my basement and my laptop is located directly above the router in my kitchen. I am highly disappointed, as I paid even more for this at Wal-Mart for $34.95 + tax. Needless to say, I'm returning this immediately."
2,Don't buy this one,"I got one last weekend and tried to install it. After installed the driver onto my Win2003 server, the system started to have some delay. The CPU usage is always between 5% ~ 25% on the old Athlon XP 2600+ machine. Then I tried this device on a WinXP box, the same thing remains. I didn't really observe the on and off phenomenon on my machines, but the CPU usage really dragged down my system. After a week, I have no choice but return it."
1,Worst wireless adapter ever,"This wireless adapter is a waste of money. It is VERY hard to install it, if not almost impossible if you haven't the driver CD (the drivers from the internet are even worse). But once you have installed it you will soon find out that the connection is very unstable... well, my body is able to establish a better connection than this thing. Don't buy it. It is worthless."
4,Belkin Wireless Adapter- it works.,"The wireless adapter works just fine. Occasionally you have to disconnect it, and then reconnect it in order for it to work, but for the most part I have had no problems. It's a very good buy for the price."
1,Buy Belkin at your own risk!,"I purchased a Belkin Model FBTOO1 version 2 Bluetooth adapter and attempted to install it on my system. When I had problems configuring the adapter, I called Belkin Tech Support, where I was told that if I had Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed, they wouldn't help me. Their device was not designed for Service Pack 2. Their solution: uninstall service pack 2. Obviously, that is not an acceptable solution. So I'm stuck with this adapter that I can't use. Belkin won't replace it, I can't return it to the place where I purchased it because it's open. So, my solution: Learn from this. Don't buy Belkin products. They have absolutely no care or concern for you, the consumer."
4,Works fine,I have been using this device for quite awhile now and have no problems to speak of. Installation went fine and have had no problems connecting to the router. I am running win 98se on my laptop and would by this product again.
1,Avoid,"This Belkin wireless USB adapter is pretty useless. Difficult to install, needs re-installation and/or reconfiguration a couple of times, needs to be unplugged and replugged very often after new boot because the W XP operating system does not seem to recognize it even with drivers properly installed, and works erroneously, dropping connections often. Total waste of money and time."
1,Terrible,"I couldn't get a consistant link with my AP, which was in the other room. My other wireless USB non-Belkin products work just fine. When I did get connected I always had good signal strength but it would then just drop me!!I also couldn't seem to set it up for Ad Hoc mode. Maybe it's possible but I gave up after spending way too long on it."
1,"Don's waste your time, buy a linksys!","I am an Apple person, so I had serious reservations about getting the Dell PC Desktop given to my wife by my son-in-law connected to my wireless network. After an hour I gave up, couldn't even get the damn thing connected via hardwire. A friend who has worked for years as an IT person, spent over 2 hrs. trying to get a wireless connection without success. He did manage to get a wired connection working. Took the Belkin back and bought a similarly priced Linksys WUSB54GC. With the same trepidation, I put the install disk in, click on the continue button, plugged in the unit to the USB and my network wireless showed up, clicked on it and AMAZING!!! It worked--no problem...just like an Apple computer! And the extender usb cord makes connecting to the back of the CPU a breeze!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this adapter two weeks ago and have had nothing but headaches with it. It appeared to install ok into my Dell desktop. After about one hour of use the adapter would lose the signal from my router. I would reset the adapter and it would find and lock on to the signal from the router. Again after 30 minutes the adapter would lose the signal from the router. I called Belkin service desk, and was walked through a repair procedure. After this the unit worked fine for about 4 hours than lost the signal again from the router. I have two other computers with Linksys adapters, these adapers have never lost the signal from the router!"
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"I have had this adapter for a couple years now, and it has never worked correctly since the beginning. After replacing just about everything else I could think of (a total waste of hundreds of dollars) I finally learned that this adapter was overheating and CONSTANTLY disconnecting from my network to cool down. I recently was able to tie this problem to uploads, as the upload traffic was too much for it to handle. Don't waste your money, people. This was not a cheap adapter by any means, and since I am running a recording studio, my PCI slots were limited. This was a way to get an adapter using USB which I had plenty of. I thought this would be a problem solver for me, but it turned out to be a headache and a financial nightmare. BUY SOMETHING ELSE OR YOU'LL BE SORRY!!!"
5,Network Adapter,Very nice priced and cheapest I have found. They are very expensive in the stores and this one works just as wellThanks
2,BELKIN F5D7050 - Poor Connectivity Speed,"I purchased the BELKIN F5D7050 Wireless Network adapter to connect a PC in the house that was previously connected via CAT5 cable.Other hardware that I have which is wireless connects well in the new location with Excellent or Very Good connectivity.Apparently, this particular adapter is graded as ""Good"" (on the ""Good, Better, Best"" scale)but I was not aware of that at the time of purchase. The device connects at the Fair or Good level (18 to 32 Mbps) rather than 54 Mbps. I suspect that this is due to the distance from the wireless router, but as noted above, all of the other devices I have connect well at that location.It may be appropriate to add a comment to the listing indicating that it is intended for slower wireless access and rated only as ""Good"" and for email but not video or gaming."
5,Nice product: Both Linux and Windows,I bought this item because i was looking for a wifi dongle without-of-the-box compatibility with Kubuntu.The dongle was immediately recognized by Kubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat).I had minor issues configuring the Wi-fi for using withmy D-link router configured with WPA2 personal (Hidden SSID). I had never configured a Wi-fi connection in Linux before.I googled a while and I found an article about how to do the configuration via console (The network manager applet didn't work for me)The installation in Windows 7 was also easy (plug n play).
1,TRASH!!,"This card is Terrible. Installing, rebooting, reinstalling, dropped connections in a matter of SECONDS...Amazon needs to give an option of ZERO stars because this is JUNK! Belkin should be ashamed of putting their name on this....I would not recommend this to ANYONE, its cheap for a reason...because its JUNK"
2,Spotty compatibility,"I had this working fine on my old PC, with no complaints about range or driver issues. I upgraded to a new PC and can't get the drivers to work at all. It simply shows up with the yellow warning in Device manager saying it cannot load the driver and I have downloaded the correct (ver 2) drivers and tried installing several times to no avail. Beware before buying this!"
1,"Oh Belkin, how I loathe thee",Worked fine... for 4 hours. Then it just died. I knew Belkin (and D-link) were 2nd-class networking brands but still bought this in spite of myself. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. Listen to everyone on here and buy something else -- if you don't have one problem mentioned you'll have another. Don't be surprised if your Belkin decides to spontaneously combust. Horrible product.
3,Buy the newer version...,"This booklet is a shorter and less complete version of ""The Lean Office Pocket Guide"", from the same authors, which is the one I would recommend you to buy."
5,Wonderful Book!,The art work in this book is really stunning. We have ready a lot of children books to our son but this is one of our favorites. The colors and story line pull everything together very nicely.
5,Love it!,Our daughter loves this book! It is her favorite! Her father reads this to her almost every night. There are times when she even recites it!
1,turbotax.com is quicker & easier,"I find that doing my taxes at www.turbotax.com to be just as easy as doing it with software. No worries about getting a ""free filing"" after a rebate. It's much easier to do your taxes safely online at their website, doing federal AND state and paying them an electronic filing fee in one easy payment. Plus..you don't have to order/buy the software, load it use it and then buy another program next year, install it etc. The website will even import last years info when you log in the following year."
1,Downloading should be easy....,"error's downloading......better to get the CDROM until Amazon figures this one out...regardless of who's end is the problem, the website should be informative enough to prevent any issues or problems in downloading."
4,Good but could even be better,"My baby quickly lost interest in this book after a few viewings. I say viewing because it's all pictures in black and white (thus the title). Some are very intricate and others less so. There weren't that many images, I wished it had more so my baby could enjoy it longer."
1,"boring, low quality, board book","I bought this book and 'White on Black"" based on the good reviews. But I was very disappointed when they arrived. First, the images are inconsistently reproduced - a few are nice, detailed line drawings, but the majority are poorly drawn simplistic shapes. For most drawings, the outlines are jagged and pixilated. Second, the choice of items is just odd. (Like a tiny elephant paired with a big bucket?!) Some shapes held my 3-month-old babies interest because they had complex and interesting forms, but most images seemed to just bore him. He was much more interested in more complex black and white shape book ""Baby Animals Black and White"" by Phyllis Limbacher Tildes. I would NOT recommend this book or any of Tana Hoban's books."
3,SO SO,"I bought this one with the LOOK, LOOK book and found this one didn't appeal to us as well as the other. We still read/look at this one but love the other much better."
3,Meh,My title says it all. I was really underwhelmed by this product & I wanted to like it bc I love the tri-retinol. I wish there were more reviews so I could compare my experience. I have oily skin prone to blackheads & this product clogged my pores. I didn't notice much brightening either. I used it for over two weeks before I gave up. Wish I could get my money back.
5,Laptop Stand,Great product. Keeps the computer cool and very comfortable when on my lap. I highly recommend this product. It was delvered fast too.
3,This book is in Spanish!!!,"Nothing (well, only the ""Guia Turistica"" beneath the title) in the information given about this guidebook prepares you for a Spanish language guidebook. However, for only $7.16, I'm going to keep it - who knows, maybe I'll learn enough Spanish on my trip to be able to read it someday!"
4,Handbook of the Psychology of Aging,"If studying Gerontology this handbook is a must. In the west, as a culture, we view aging with a jaundice eye, and whether we like it or not most of us will age well past our grandparents and perhaps even past our parents. Spending 30/40 years in a negative state of mind regarding our chronological age and all that will encompass is at this point ridiculous, and counterproductive to an opportunity humanity has never had before.Handbook of the Psychology of Aging, Sixth Edition (Handbooks of Aging)"
2,Poor,"Incessant and nonsensical bickering among new neighbors, which for no good reason periodically blossoms into physical violence, is the core of this unnecessary and tiring novel. Mercilessly silly, artistically and in every other way, it should be avoided because although it pedals hard it covers no ground and inspired in me all kinds of frustration and nearly no thought. Years and years ago, I remember liking two or three other Berger novels and still mean to read ""Little Big Man"" at some point, but after this book I think I'll need a little cooling off period."
4,Rabin is on a roll!,"Another excellent score album by Rabin! It contains a wonderful main theme lead by the flute, typical militaristic percussion for action sequences, and a sweet little romance theme. The orchestra and choir really bring this score to life.Like THE GREAT RAID, this score is dramatic and patriotic. The songs are out of order and some track titles spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. Still, Varese gave the album a good release allowing Rabin to expose his maturing talents to the world!This album is definitely one to own!"
4,"A little bit of ""Glory""?","I enjoyed the music and will be the first to acknowledge Mr. Rabin is a gifted composer, but I wonder if anyone else noticed the similarities to James Horner's 1989 music for the movie Glory? (a lonely Christmas). In any event, I enjoyed the movie and the music and recommend both."
4,Good for the money,"I actually bought a pair from ebay at the beginning of summer (3 months ago?) for $3 and they're still working great! They're surprisingly loud - I mean that in a good way - and the earbud design allows you to get some outside noise. The sound seems pretty clear as well, but maybe I'm used to crummy headphones. I'm not much of an audiophile so this review is mostly here to say that these headphones work pretty well.I wear mine whenever I'm listening to my ipod.. which usually is when I'm walking around or running. I've had some problems with the earbuds falling out occassionally, but I've found that twining the earbud wires helps keep them in place. And that the left earpiece doesn't fit my left ear very well. Funny. My only other gripe is that the cable is a little short, but that's nothing too serious."
1,Ouch !!!!!!They are huge,"wow,i never thought i write a bad review on Amazon.I thought the pink color and JVC are good combo.AY!Ay!They are huge and they hurt.The Sound is bad,the bass is so-so but when you get to a album like ""garbage"" (bleed like me) album it is terrible.Sounds like nails on chalkboard.Well, i thought since there were so many good reviews i bought it but maybe it's me but they are awful.You would think the gummy design would be comfortable."
5,It works in our alkaline water,"Our natural water is very alkaline, at the top end of the acceptable hardness scale. In our pond we use no artificial chemicals but rely on biological balance. Our fish live on the natural algae growth.We added 1/2 gallon of Eco Labs MLXSAG4 Liquid Sludge Away to our 4000 gallon pond last spring. We use a little barley straw and some Accu clear (twice all summer). Our water remains clear, the fish remain healthy, and the algae growth is modest. We are very pleased.I should add that we are careful to maintain the chemical balance in the pond. If the nitrate level gets too high, then we dump some of the pond water and add fresh. The enriched pond water is good fertilizer for the shrubs and grass."
2,Bought it and sent it back,"This was a great printer as far as print quality and speed... but what Minolta doesn't tell you in advance is that if you either refill the cartridge or use a non-new or non-factory cartridge, the printer goes into ""deep cleaning"" mode (permanently) while printing and slows down to about 6ppm. It won't go back up to regular speed unless you install a new Minolta cartridge.This, of course, is a completely bogus excuse for forcing you to buy Minolta toner (which costs $130).I called tech support to confirm that there was no workaround, and the woman I spoke with had received 4 complaints that morning on that issue.So I sent it back and bought a Samsung ML-1710, which, although a little bit slower (17ppm instead of 21) can use any toner and seems like an excellent little printer."
4,"Great as a dedicated PC Printer, not as a network printer.","Warning !!! This is a GDI printer. Therefore you can not set this printer to work on a home network using dedicated TCP/IP print servers (i.e., D-Link DP-301P+, Linksys EtherFast Print Servers, etc.). As a GDI printer it does not have a builtin command processor. In other words it is a HOST based printer relying on your PC's processor as the brains to process print jobs. I made this mistake!!! Be forewarned !!!! Do not buy this product if you wish to use it on a home network!!!"
1,Requires a Mechanic!,"I wish Amazon gave the Reviewer a ""No Star"" option.I appreciate the speedy printing of this item; but that is all... Also, that's not saying much, since it was my first new printer in several years, and I had missed several ""generations"" of speed...First problem, I find that the top paper-holder that is suposed to keep the pages in order while they come out doesn't! Pages end up falling over the front of the front of the machine so that you have to pay extra close attention to make sure you catch all of them, and that they are in order...Bigger problem is that it jams a lot, and it is VERY difficult to pull the paper(s) out It has a vice-grip on the sheets, so that you end up tugging and wripping the paper. Then, the area where the torn edge is is too small to fit fingers into to manipulate. There are not enough removeable parts to aid in paper extraction.Don't biu tjos [romter... I think it is an example of ""You (usually) get what you pay for..."""
3,talking to this printer,"If it did not broken, I might give 5 stars. But when I open it, the right side on the bottom of this printer, the fan windows , was compressed to some pieces. I will think before I buy if I want to but something in Amazon after that. Except that, this printer is really very good to use."
1,Stay away from this printer,I'll get right to the point. The printer is going to cost you a bundle to replace the carterage which will cost about $80 after a few months. It jams a lot. Don't make the mistake I made and buy it from Staples on sale for $99. Your better off buying a Dell printer for $200. Also the paper tray is outside and jams a lot. I got so upset that I took this printer lifted it up and threw it to the ground and broke it after it kept on jamming again and again. For my business I have a Dell printer it almost never jams. Don't be cheap and stay away from this piece of garbage.
3,VERY SMALL,THESE EARRINGS WILL BE GREAT FOR A BABY OR YOUNG PERSON-THEY ARE TINY-NICE LOOKING AND APPEAR TO BE WELL MADE-BUT FOR AN ADULT I WOULD PASS!
3,Rare CD Cover Versions Of Bee Gees,"This is a collection of Bee Gees cover songs that was officially approved by the Bee Gees. With 17 cuts, it makes for an eclectic album. Most of the artists are unknown, save for 'N SYNC that does a great tribute medley of, ""Jive Talking/Too Much Heaven/How Deep Is Your Love/Stayin' Alive"". There is an all German version of ""Wind Of Change"", a psychodelic interpretation of ""World"" by Marusha and another by U96. Take That's #1 cover of ""How Deep Is Your Love"" opens the album and Whirlpool Productions really puts an odd spin on ""Tragedy"". Not all the songs are great renditions and I would suggest this only for the completist who will be thankful to have it."
2,An Ok tribute,"I was a little disappointed with this cd. One or two good songs on there, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,I object,"The thing that bothers me about some critics is that they fail to consider the technology and the time the movie was made. I find somethings humourous, but as a whole it is a quality movie for 1935. Those of us who were kids when these movies were first seen on TV, were able to use our imaginations and be much more creative than many of today's hi tech kids. It is all relevant. It was great for it's day and should be considered as such. If we are unable to accept that today's movies will be jokes to our grandchildren, then perhaps we should not watch anything older that a year or so and remain comfortable within our little narrow boxes."
5,Quality item,"Since the introduction of the internet, there are fewer and fewer ""brick and mortar"" stores where you can find simple, low-profit items offered by retailers as a convenience to their customers.In a nutshell, certain items have become nearly impossible to find at a local store. It was my experience that this was one of them. This is a good product, simple and inexpensive yet sturdy."
5,A lovely first album from a band destined for greatness,"Asobi Seksu are an excellent band. Their music is dreamy at times but driving at other moments as well. This first album really captures a moment in time. They tend to get classified as shoegazer music, which puts them in a league with some excellent bands from the early '90s like Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Swervedriver. This import edition contains a bonus live track that is not on the domestic release -- well worth it. The CD also has a video of the single ""Walk On The Moon."" If you're looking to expand your musical horizons, this CD is an excellent place to start. If you're a long-time fan of Asobi Seksu, then this enhanced import edition will really satisfy. Either way it's a great album from a great band."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"After reading several of the great reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I now wish I had not wasted my time (only made it half way thru) and my money.The switch between first and third person writing style, was hard to follow at times. I also was not drawn into the characters, and frankly wasn't lead to care about them at all.In the future I will pay more attention to ALL reviews."
5,Chuck Prophet's Better Half,"Go Go Market is the feminine alter ego of Chuck Prophet's Mission Express. Fronted by longtime Prophet musical cohort Stephanie Finch (aka Mrs. Prophet), Go Go Market finds the man of the house taking the supportive role as guitarist, co-writer and producer and The Missus finally taking an opportunity to flaunt her impressive dual talents as a singer and songwriter on this delightful debut disc. This is no labor of side project love, this is the real musical deal. With tunes lying somewhere between the elemental soul of Dusty Springfield in Memphis and the sunny summertime pop of the Cardigans, Go Go Market might just eclipse Mr. Prophet's newly found Adult Alternative radio success. Stand out songs include the sunshine pop ""Rainmaker,"" the Dusty-esque ballad ""Let's Stay Here,"" and the funk-friendly ""Channel Nine."""
4,You Will Learn Just As Much As Reading a Medical Reference,"You will learn just as much as reading a medical reference, except Marc Lappe adroitly puts it all together in a plain text. We are all very obesses with colors and appearance of our skins yet neglect the fact that skin is the front-line boundary against an inimical world. Therefore, more than to your anesthetic sense of beauty, the skin provides resistance and separates us from the outside world through a thinnest of margins. Lappe discusses how the newly discovered permeability of the skin, long recognized by other cultures, has lead to the use of drug-bearing patches; how potentially harmful chemicals penetrate the skin; how vulnerable we are to particular environments. You have to read it yourself and discover ""skin""."
1,"Completely misleading. It's all common-sense, positive thinking b.s.","I bought the $500 program and this book, both from Ms. Bassett, and I've never felt more ripped off in my life. It's true, this book might help people who have mild, externally-based anxieties like getting on a plane and public speaking, and (gasp) throwing a dinner party, but for people who have more severe anxieties, this book will do absolutely NOTHING. In fact, if you're someone who actually suffers, listening to her whine about getting on a plane (oh how terrible), this will just make you angry."
1,Nothing New,"She's not a therapist. I feel as if she is using her past anxiety problems to rip off the people with anxiety problems. If you want a good book, see Dr. Edmund Bourne's Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, the gold standard among self help for anxiety."
1,Not my type of Book,"I read this book hoping to gain a wealth of insight into the problem of fears and was disappointed to find that the first half of the book went about describing different case studies with the hope of having the reader to identify. The amount of info that deals with handling these fears could have been condensed into a pamphlet. Sorry, Lucinda, but I was bored with it."
2,From Panic to Power : Proven Techniques to Calm Your Anxieti,"Only a generic review of anxiety disorder. The case studies were somewhat interesting although the author's story got a little old and was not that interesting. I had to read this book for a Psychology class and was not impressed. Suggest ""The Relaxation and Stress Reduction Workbook"" by Davis, M, et.al."
3,Like Running in Place...,"Mundy, the protagonist, completes a grand circle of experience by the time the book concludes.The reader's experience is similar, except that there are circles within circles, by which I mean that you have the sensation of going over the same ground again and again without getting anywhere. The writing that initially seems evocative and incandescent simply wears itself out through repetition. There is a sameness to Mundy's experiences with the various solidier-mentors, as well as the interactions with the spirits and the ""niggers"" that eventually left me feeling impatient and irritable.It's a very interesting concept, and I'd recommend starting the book. Even if you peter out halfway through and don't finish it--you'll have 99% of what the book has to offer anyway."
2,Yawn,I bought this book because the title intrigued me and the opening paragraphs were well written. I wish I hadn't bothered. A novel that showed promise quickly degenerated into a self absorbed whine of the I'm-such-a-poor-misunderstood-artist type. My advise -- skip this one.
3,Not quite what I expected ...,"Even though this was a good book on lamps, it really is not what I expected. I was hoping that it coverd more of the traditional old lamps. All of the ones in this book where more modern style."
3,Suspenseful Film,Spanish thriller about a home invasion. There is an English dubbed version along with English subtitles available. Intense film. Package arrived on time and in great condition.
3,Alexander McCall Smith,"Good, but not delightful. Now, ALL of the #1 Woman Dectective Agency books are delightful!!"
2,Not a mystery; don't be fooled,"Am I mistaken, or was this series originally billed as a mystery series? The word ""mysteries"" is frequently used alongside ""Isabel Dalhousie,"" so I'm assuming that at some point, Smith thought that's what he was writing.The first book had a murder on page one. Book two took almost half the book before anything resembling a mystery began. In this book there is NO mystery at all, only a philosophically marinated romance novel in which Isabel finally has to come to terms with her feelings toward her niece's rejected boyfriend, as well as her habit of nosing into other people's business. So if that's your cup of tea, enjoy. But if you are assuming this is a ""cosy"" mystery, you will be disappointed."
3,Better and cheaper than trying to make it myself,"The costume didn't come with the curls like it appears to have in the picture. I was really disappointed about that :_( Also, the hat looks more like something a cook would wear. However, this was the least expensive high priest costume I found after searching the internet for days. In the end I think it's worth it because of all the time and money it would take to make it from scratch."
5,HIGH FIVE FOR THIS ONE,"Ben Bova never disappoints. He's at the top of his form in this thoroughly entertaining collection of short stories featuring Sam Gunn - a man sans scruples, a wannabe Lothario who is usually on the make. He's vertically challenged, and a defender of justice.These five chapters from Gunn's life are artfully rendered, taking us on hair-raising adventures as this jack-of-all-trades perseveres in his pursuit of money, power and women. He's not averse to suing the Pope or defeated when brought to trial for interplanetary genocide."
5,Fascinating!,"""The River of God"" is the metaphor Professor Riley uses to describe the history of today's New Testament---and a very effective metaphor it is! He talks about the context of the events: political, sociological, and religious atmospheres throughout history as the 'tributaries' which influenced the document as we use it today. He has a style of writing that is quite pleasant to read. The book is scholarly without being stuffy (or dry!) or judgemental. Highly recommended for a surprisingly good read!"
3,a guidline for how to treat injured or ill birds and animals,This book is just a guidline for how to care for the ill or injured wildlife. I feel that this book gives too much freedom to the reader to care for the injured bird or animal themselves. It does not stress the fact that you have to take the animal to a vet.
4,Guild Wars: EotN Review,"A nice addition to the three primary campaigns. New models for new enemies (rather than just re-skinning old ones), good new skills, new titles to go chasing after if you're into that sort of thing.Overall it's a new playground for your characters, though expect the critters to be of stiffer stuff than most other areas. It also uses the previous overall continent for Tyria, which was nice since after playing through Prophecies I wanted to go explore the rest of the continent but couldn't. Significantly more in Tyria now. And there are fairly large underground areas, too, the new ""dungeons"" addition to the game. A good idea.The story stuck at about the level the primary campaigns did, so don't expect something terribly enthralling. Evil critter type X comes to destroy us all! Defeat the evil critters! The end.The only major disappointment I had about EotN was no new elite skills. They really could have added in a few for each of the classes. Oh well.Good game overall. 4/5."
4,Not like I remembered but still fun,"I guess I've just been spoiled with all the good graphics out there today. This game looks like pixelated garbage. It's still fun, but gives me a headache after ten minutes. Also, no reverse? WTF??? I hate bouncing off of walls to turn around!"
1,Sad!,I loved playing this game growing up but I can't play it now with the condition it's in! The screen seems slow to keep up and in a racing game that's kind of essential. Im so disappointed as this was a gift.
2,Frustrating,"Early levels are easy but watch out when you do the hard ones - the AI is BRUTALIf you want to play the original that started it all, this might be for you, but if you just wanted one of the Mario Kart series, look for the DS version or the one on Wii."
5,An excellent read!!!!!!,"I belive that it is good to read books about the tarot to give you some informative insight as a beginner, but it sticks better when you have a workbook, especially as in-depth as this one. Mary Greer touches on, if not everything, then many things you should know about the tarot. Like a reviewer already stated, it's not just about memorizing the cards (which could be very tedious), but learning how to build your own feeling and intuition for the cards, and relating them to your situations in your own life. By the time your done with this book, you will feel much more comfortable with tarot and your intuition relating to your life. I highly recommend this book because not just your regular tarot book, it's more like SERIOUSLY learning something new! I believe that experienced tarot card readers can benifit from this. This book is a challenge, but it's a lot of fun! Before you can read others, you should know how to read your self! I hope I've convinced you! Happy reading!"
3,Little Too Complicated,Tarot is something I've always wanted to learn. Mary Greer's book came highly recommended and received great reviews so I purchased it.The first couple of chapters were complicated and difficult to comprehend.Ms. Greer advises the reader to purchase several other books to better understand the meanings in this one.The middle chapters were more self-explanatory.I wouldn't recommend this workbook for someone who knows nothing about Tarot. Not a beginners read.
1,Broken after a week and a half,"I thought I'd spend $10 on some good earbuds that would last me a little longer than the $2 ones you get at the Dollar Store. But no, I bought JVC Gumys the Monday before last, it's now Friday, and the right speaker is out already. The cheapos lasted at least 4 weeks. You can't expect any damn thing to work any more. This kind of cheap manufacturing is now standard and it's crazy that this is accepted. What a rip off."
3,"Cool, but uncomfortable...","Looking for a comfortable pair of earbuds that wouldnt hurt my ears, I just bought these earbuds today retail, hoping that they would fit in my ears comfortably, since they looked like they would and even said it on the package. Came home, tried them on and about 5 minutes after wearing them, they started hurting my ear canals. Maybe my ears just aren't meant to have earbuds in them, but these are not for small or abnormal ear canals."
2,OK,"OK.. not great. I would probably spend a couple more bucks and get something of better quality.The buds are kinda big, so they don't stay in my ears, and the sound quality totally does not compare to the standard issue ipod headphones that I was trying to replace... overall... OK, not great."
2,Baby found it completely uninteresting,I bought this book to target my baby's eyesight stage of enjoying black and white images. He found the book completely uninteresting compared to others (from birth to 5 months). Sits on the bottom of the toybox now.
2,much better picture books available,"Evidentally, many babies like the white on black images of this book. However, my daughter always much preferred picture books with bright, primary colors even when she was just a few weeks old. But my main concern with this book is that the first image presented in it is that of a baby bottle. As a breastfeeding mother, I do not appreciate the mainstreaming of bottle imagery, especially in books meant for the very youngest readers."
3,missed the mark with this one,This book of lists is not quite as funny as the first but there are still a few laugh-out-loud entries.
4,The Golden Ratio is Golden!,"The book does a very good job of explaining the history of irrational numbers in general and Phi specifically, however, I feel that it is still a bit too technical for laymen not used to dealing with numbers on a regular basis. Be that as it may, this book is still worth a read if you find numbers as fascinating as I do!"
5,Golden Indeed!,"Following in the steps of his earlier, just as fascinating account linking cosmology and the arts (""The Accelerating Universe""), Mario Livio continues to prove he is one of the most original, exciting and literate writers of popular science today. ""The Golden Ratio"" is a witty and learned journey generally following the trail of the number Phi, but stopping along the way to take in subjects as diverse as philosophy, history, art, religion, the sciences, architecture, etc.Writing about science in a way that is both knowledgeable and understandable for the common reader is an infamous hurdle, but Livio leaps over it with the greatest of ease, giving clear explanations of every potentially difficult matter and providing the scientific proofs in the appendices, for those more mathematically inclined. Overall, though, it is the great humanity of Livio's worldview that shines through the book and makes it, at least for me, one of the most memorable reads of the year."
3,A quick read,"I can't say I was overly impressed with this book, although it would be a reasonable introduction to the number phi and all the ways it shows up (and may not show up.) But I was looking for something more substantive. Still, it had enough bits and pieces that it was interesting, and it was short enough that it didn't take up too much time to read."
3,Decent,"I bought this book from a designer's perspective and hoped to get some good insight on the use of Phi in art and design. The first chapter or two gave a good start but then it went into half a book of history of philosophy and mathematics that, while relevant (I guess), didn't really help me when it came to learning about the use of Phi. I ended up skimming through the rest of the book. Towards the end there's some more samples of how it may or may not have been used in the past, but by that time my mind was so glazed over I didn't really read any.As a history of the number and a general historical mathematical book, it's not too bad. It's written well enough. But for a designer trying to get new ideas, it didn't really work."
4,Good but lengthy,"The book could really be summed up in few pages. Moreover could get the taste of phi from the internet itself, one need not buy this book. Definately Phi is an irrational numbers of all irrational numbers but what is the rational behind making it the golden ratio and fall in love with it. To me Pi is also a fasinating number."
2,it .... hardcore,"Here's the skinny on this 3D point-and-click puzzle/adventure title: If your old enough to read the overwhelming amount of text this game slings at you, then your far to old to play it. But if your too young to follow along a Plucky and his mates blather away, then you won't have the slightest clue as to what's going on here. And if you somehow fall into an unknown third category, then, well, you still won't want to play this game."
1,For those who have lost photos on their Viking card...,"This is a follow up on an earlier post where I reported my really bad experience with my Viking flash card. Two different Viking 256k CF cards, two different cameras. This product is totally unreliable. My first card failed after taking a weeks worth of pictures on a Costa Rica vacation (argh!). The replacement warranty card (no way I would have PAID for a second one!) randomly loses pictures with a corrupt data error. I have reformatted my 2nd card and I still randomly and intermittently lose pictures. Maybe from Viking's perspective of someone in the business of strip mining CF cards, this is an acceptable failure rate, but when you are counting on this thing to record precious memories, I promise you'll which you had spent a couple bucks more on a card you trust.[...]"
4,Give me more memory,"With my 5 mega pixel camera, 16, 32 or even 64meg is NOT enough memory. Give me 256 Meg. It sure is nice being able to catch quite a few pics before I have to download."
1,don't trust your precious memories,"I purchased this card a couple months ago and have taken many pictures and bragged about this card to many people. But yesterday, only 4 months after buying, when I tried to download the pictures from my childs 3rd birthday, nothing. NOTHING! Card memory error it told me, translating to NOTHING! Now I have no pictures of my childs 3rd birthday thanks to this card. I would gladly pay twice the cost to have an effective memory card and have my childs birthday pictures. I would not purchase this again and will not recommend to anyone else!"
2,"sneaky Vikings, cheap on rebates!","The card works fine, it's their rebate policies I'm not fond of.I bought 2 vikings 256MB cards thinking that I'll get a rebate for each card. NOT the case!Read the fine prints on item 6 on the rebate form, only 1 rebate per FAMILY ADDRESS, regardless how many products you buy. Not quite the normal rebate policies I encounter.With so much competition out there, Vikings isn't really helping itself with the rebate policy."
5,As Good As Any,"I used the Viking 256mb card with my Olympus E-10. I also have the Olympus SmartMedia cards along with a Sandisk SmartMedia card and I absolutely see no difference whatsoever in the write time. I have had absolutely no problems with the card. It uploads just fine, even directly through the USB from my camera. There is no question you can't beat the price of Viking and I think without question their quality is as good as anyone else. Save your money. Buy Viking."
5,timely rebate,rebate was sent on time... i had four rebates in process at different times and all came intime...product is also working fine after 1 yr..
2,After 10 months of use started to loose data.,"I use the card since last September.In June a message ""No CF card"" started to appear onCanon's S230 display.Sometime Canon can not save the picture.To fix the problem I remove and insert the card once or twice."
3,No good after one year...,"I bought this because I loved the price...I only paid $15 after mail-in rebate. I used it non-stop for one year and it held many pictures and video from my digital camera. But unfortunately, it just stopped working the other day. I had about 100 photos stored on the card, as well as some video of my boyfriend being presented with a puppy for christmas, and it is all GONE. When I tried to download it to my computer, it said there was no image. If I try to take a picture with the card, it says I only have room left for 6 pictures. I just cannot access the picture I've already taken.I am very disappointed, but I had to give it three stars because it was fine for an entire year (about 2,000 pictures) and the cost was impressive."
5,Pull yourself up by your bra strap,"This book is pure delight. Even the cover is fun.Jeanne Brice, the author is the star of Quacker Factory a wonderful whimsical inspirational line of clothes for large and all women sold by QVC. Her book has excerpts of her life and wisdom. It's beautifully done from the cover and all through the book with fun pictures and sayings. Each chapter stands by itself and is so inspirational filling that I only read one chapter at a time.When I need a best friend Jeannie's book is there to give me what I need,such as her quote""Triumph is just a little umph added to try.""This book is a keeper. I plan to buy a second one to lend to my friends. Enjoy."
5,Darling,"This was a darling book. Jeanne was a very special person, and lived her life to uplift many people! Fun book!"
1,Most Annoying Golf Video,This video is unwatchable. I bought this video because of all the positive reviews. If you want to hear an annoying Boston accent mixed with karate mixed with golf then go ahead and waste your money. If you want to spend your money wisely then just go get a lesson. A lesson from a pro will be more effective and efficient then some video comparing golf to karate.
4,Pretty decent,"This is better than most of the X-men novels. Tho, be prepared that the heroes are powerless for most of the book. Better than some of the current X-men comics."
3,"kyjgagsfan, louisa, ky","Dark Mirror was a good read.Not great, but good.Bought it on a whim. Mentally challenging to ""visualize"". The story rolled fairly well,with a few slow spots."
5,"Response to viewer from WA, USA","This is an excellent series! By the way, as a correction to an earlier review, ""Tutter the Mouse"" is voiced and performed by Peter Linz."
2,Not What I Expected,"Since these said insertable dividers, I thought that you could insert a page in between them - like a pocket. That is not the case. I had printed off 20 or so sheets to go inside my dividers, and then I realized that I could not put them inside. The dividers are just a clear, sheet. If that's what you want, then that's fine. It's just that is not what I was expectin."
3,Used these for a coupon binder,"I used these for a coupon binder I was working on, and the only complaint I had was that I didn't read it enough to know that there were only five in the package.. Which was completely my own fault."
1,A big stir over little that's new,"The recommendations of the Okinwa Program repeat information that has been available for a long time. The benefits of low-fat, low-calorie diets, exercise, and reducing stress are well known. This is just one more book for the already overloaded shelf of self-help books. It might be interesting to compare life-expectancy of Okinawans BEFORE World War II with this data, as it necessarily excludes members of the same generation who died of malnutrition, illness, accident, or war-time incidents before that time."
3,Okinawa secret,"The secret of Okinawan longevity, of course, is thatthey practice caloric restriction. There is nothing mysticalabout their diet other than it being many fewer calories.For 70 years, CR has been shown to significantly extendlifespan in all animals tested. Recently, a scientistat Harvard Medical School found a way to tweak the samegene/enzyme into overload that CR does (it activatesthe same longevity gene/enzyme) using a plant polyphenolcalled ""Resveratrol"". The research on Resveratrol's anti-cancer,anti-stroke, pro-lung-function and now longevity effects arevoluminous. You don't need to starve yourselfon *any* diet in order to live longer and better.Just get the right Resveratrol supplement (in pill form) into your diet.I won't advocate any particular supplement but suffice it to say thatthere is only one that is bio-available and will tweak the samegene/enzyme that Okinawans tweak through their near-starvationdiet. I'm on it. So's my wife. So's my best friend. That is allI can say."
4,lovely book,This is lovely little book. The anecdotes and details about chai and its origins are almost as warming as the tea itself.
2,"The Author and the Subject, A Love Story","Although the information you get is quite nice, the way it is brought to you is not. Winans is so pro Tisch it becomes silly. Most of the world is bad and Tisch is fighting it. I, for instance, would love to learn more about the, so convenient, burning down of the two money losing and well insured hotels."
4,good game,"I like this game, I don't think it is as good as the Zelda games, but it was a good substitute after I beat Zelda, and needed more. I like games that make you think, instead of only fighting games. There are alot of puzzles to figure out on this game. I really wish they would make a Legend of Gaia for N64. I would buy it immediately."
4,Stopped feeding fish,"I really don't now how to rate it. The ingrediant list is good, simple (ie: no crap) BUT....I stopped feeding Grady fish period. Because our oceans and fish are too polluted. The ocean is a toxic waste dump.I personally have a very bad reaction to fish oils. I've tried four different fish oils and all caused extremely bad/HUGE cysts, enlarged pores and increased oil production on my face. Four years later I still have the scares.1. Costco Kirkland Signature' Fish Oil Concentrate (clear capsules)2. Costco Kirkland Signature' Enteric Coated Fish Oil Concentrate (white capsules)3. Spectrum Fish Oil4. Dr. Weil's Omega-3 ComplexAnd those fish oils above are purified products. Just imagine what toxins are in fish cat food."
5,Voice of an angle,"Joy Lynn White is most unreconized Country Singer in Nashville I have all her cd's and wish she would make more.She has a real country voice not this Pop sound out now.Joy Lynn White I am a fan for life,and thanks for the great music!!!!"""
2,Do not buy this game.,This game is plagued with bad controls and boring levels which all look the same. The plot is weak to begin with and the story progresses slowly. Maybe it's because I bought it used without the instruction manual but I really did not enjoy this game one bit. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's possible I'm a little too old for the game.It's only for little kids who are used to Mario-type sidescrollers.
4,Pinobee:Wings of Adventure,"Pinobee is a pretty good game, it has good graphics and interesting things to do, but the levels can get really long and boring after a while. For one, in each level there is a golden enemy to beat that will stop the enemies from getting any harder, but sometimes it can be a pain in the neck to find. The levels are also pretty easy to blast through as fast as you can, but again, you need to go throught the whole level to get the full effect of the game. Otherwise, I like it a lot."
1,The worst notebook I have ever seen,"This is by far the worst notebook I have ever come across. It's so bad that I actually came to Amazon to leave a review for it.The first day I used it pages started falling out. After a couple of weeks the thing was held together with tape. After a month one half the paper just up and fell out while I was writing in it. I've since decided to tear out all the pages--which I did by opening the notebook and gently blowing on it--and place them in a three ring binder instead.Maybe if actual glue were used in the manufacture of this product, instead of just spitting on the binding and placing loose-leaf paper inside and hoping for the best, this would not be the absolute waste of time and money that it is.Spiral all the way."
5,Best fighter game of the era,"I SO loved this game when I was younger. Played it in the arcade first, then had to buy the SNES system just for this game (although I played others).It is a SHAME this game was no release for other systems and current systems. Young game players are missing out of an AWESOME game!!"
4,Okay,"This is basically the NES version of Megaman repackaged for Game Boy. It's decent for a handheld version, but the NES version is better, in my opinion. This game doesn't have much of a story, and the small screen makes gameplay a little harder than on the NES Megaman series."
2,Too hard to be fun or innovative,"Take everything wrong with Mega Man 1 and 2 on the NES and you get this. Your fired shots travel WAY TOO SLOW on the Game Boy, and these stages, especially the Fortress and Space Station at the end of the game, are NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE! Plus if you lose in either you have to start over, and that means if you die at the end of the Fortress, at the hands of a Robot Leader, you have to fight the whole way back to them, and any you beat must be beaten again.ROBOT LEADERS WAVE ONE: Elec Man, Cut Man, Fire Man, Ice ManFORTRESS ROBOT LEADERS: Bubble Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, Quick Man, and ?This ain't no masterpiece and is for Mega Man die-hards only."
1,Absolutely awful,"He sacrifices everything for the sake of speed...horrible tone, rhythmic inaccuracies, it's a complete mess. Williams and others can make the guitar sing...Fisk makes it stutter. He is a complete fraud who does a disservice to his instrument and to musicians in general."
1,"Does not have exercises on this, just an interview!",I purchased this DVD thinking it was the DVD w/ David Berceli's exercises on it but it was an interview taken w/o any exercises.
5,A good machine for a affordable price,"Great MP3 player, recorder, photo viewer.. Easy to use specially for kid.. Is not an Ipod but is tinny, light weight and discret.."
3,Still a big mystery to me...,"Well, I wish it was as reliable as my old, brick - size RCA player, but it isn't . It has some good days and bad ones. On good days it rocks. The quality of sound is great and operating this little fella is very intuitive. On bad days it just skips. It skips like every few minutes, and jeez is it anoying.... Since it is a MTP player you need Creative software to transfer songs to the player. I use it with Rhapsody and it works just fine."
2,Budget KVM,"Upgraded from older connector type Belkin KVM, whick still worked but didn't have USB. This model did the same and alot more. Provide the use of USB connectors and allowed a jump drive to be plugged into the kvm and share between the connected computers. Also allowed speakers and microphone to be share with the current active computer. Came with a set of 4 USB/video/audio cables and a serial connector for upgrading the firmware.Only problem I've had was after the purchase of a new Logitech mouse. The new mouse would only go verticle. After research I've found this problem was know by Iogear and when I attempted to install the firmware I found it to be the current firmware installed.So My new mouse is now useless until a new firmware is created.Other item is that the 4 supplied cable, aren't very long. Should have been supplied with 1 8ft., 1 10ft and 2 12ft cables. Then even being $10 higher in price it would have been well worth it.Miners! Not Minors"
5,Why use anything else?,"This IOGEAR unit is a ""must have"" brand in our opinion. Just the fact that this model allows you to hot-plug PCs makes it a ""rare bird"" and it blows away it's competition. Buy it with cables included and no other brand can come close to IOGEAR's value."
2,Disappointing sound for the price paid,"While the Apple Hi-Fi Home Stereo offers an attractive concept - direct play from any iPod in a compact system, sound quality is disappointing given the price of the device. While pop music sounds ok, classical music (the true test of a hifi stereo system) sounds truly terrible, with all nuances of the music sounding muddled or missing. Within the electronically-enhanced music system category, even a Bose does a better job. For the same price, get yourself a Denon compact stereo system with Mission speakers and plug your iPod into it - you will get real hi-fi stereo and will be much happier."
4,Lots to like...,"Good looking package. Nice long power cord. Aux and iPod dock inputs. Battery power for mobile use. Apple remote. The features are what make this unit special.I am a home recording enthusiast and have been listening to / making music on semi-pro monitor speakers for many years, therefore, I have developed a pretty critical ear. This unit sounds really good. It can play loud and deliver impressive bass for a unit this size. It's a little bit punchy in the mid-range, but only a little.For my purposes I am very pleased with the Hi-Fi. Although it doesn't sound as good as a true 2.1 system with a wider stereo spread and deeper bass, it sounds really very nice and the features, as I said before, are what set this unit apart.I have had the unit for about a month or more and am over the ""honeymoon"" period as I write this review. That said, I would buy it again and I am quite satisfied."
1,I CAN'T BELEIVE IT!,"I can't beleive that this game got such good reviews! It is sooooo boring! It is really fun for about 3 days, but then you just get frustraited and bored. The whole game is just a bunch of hard puzzles. Its kind of cool that you can animate your own characters, but the game is not entertaining enough. I also bought some zelda games for my game boy advance, and those are all i play. I never play chu chu rocket anymore, and I am sorry I bought it. The only reason I bought it was because it got such good reviews...! These people that say the game is addictive are nuts! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! IT WILL BORE YOU TO DEATH! BUY THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: ORACLE OF AGES AND SEASONS. THOSE ARE GREAT GAMES."
2,It has weird smell,I have grown Tulsi in my house. I know the smell of tulsi even in oil form. This oil smells weird and i am not sure of its effect. I tried to inhale it for kapha reasons ( ayurvedic term for too much phlegm and mucus) It isnt that great. However it is said to clean air so I am diffusing this oil with hot water.
5,Excellent card!,"I bought this 128mb card back in November of 2002 and have used it ever since.It's in an Olympus D520 2mp camera (which I also use as a 128mb USB portable disk drive between work & home). My employer won't buy a cd-rw drive, so I had to innovate.The card is excellent. Easy to use and capacity so big I never need to change cards."
3,Nice card for the price,"have been using this card since early 2003. No complain so far, stores a lot of pics for my fuji finepix."
5,At least this one works,"In another review, I describe the negative experience I had with a Sandisk 128MB card. In summary, the card was defective and I lost 240 pictures. More recently, I have been using this Viking card and it has worked flawlessly, at least so far.I have a 2 megapixel camera, and in HQ mode each photo is approximately 500K, and in SHQ mode 1MB. This means you can fit 256 or 128 photos in the respective modes. In my brief experience I have found the HQ mode sufficient for most photos, so for me this card stores the equivelant of 10 rolls of film. For my 2 megapixel camera, this has been a convenience. For those who plan to save even larger files, I would say that the 128MB size is essential. And with the falling prices on these cards, it makes more sense than ever to invest in a card this size."
3,Started strong....then you hear the fade.,"Overall I thought this was a very interesting release. Buying on album clips and scattered reviews alone I was pleased overall. The first few tracks really blew me away and made me feel as if I picked a winner. I would describe these tracks as more experimental and expansive rock chops with a very spacious feel, but then the album turns to more forgettable and conventional song structures that lost my interest quickly. I wish I could be more specific about this album but I purchased it with a bulk of other CD's which were a little more solid in presentation so this one went to the back burner after one full listen. But once again I am pleased with disc and welcome it to my collection as would any music fan. Adios."
2,mezzo????,"I really can't believe all the hype regarding this girl. She is beautiful, but is an average singer. Her voice is pretty, but rather boring, and I am sure that this girl should be singing soprano rep, she certainly doesn't touch Bartoli and never will."
1,A Loser,"If it were possible I would rate this item at no stars, completely undependable. Requires constant recalibration lasting for all of a few minures. Have tried all the suggested remedies, including new batteries, nothing works. Next stop is the recycling center."
4,Star Wars,"Beyond this games [bad] graphics, it is a pretty good game. It would be nice if you could save it. I do think you should buy this game. It is very fun."
5,"I'm gonna let you finish, but this is the best tape measure of all time","I know this is a completely subjective field, but if you are a connoisseur of tape measures and don't mind spending twice what you normally do then this is the best tape measure of all time. I love the normal fat max tape measure. The only thing I didn't care for was the hook. It frequently would lose it's grip on whenever the it had to go longer than 9' & what was being measured was at high angle which is basically all i measure. The Xtreme packs the fattest & catchiest hook I've ever used. I measure slabs of granite that are standing up in excess of 10' she hasn't let go yet. She is also even easier to read than the original fatmax. Lastly the chrome makes this the pimped version of the fat max. You probably don't need this tape measure, but I promise you want to have it."
2,Glue on pad keeps it from opening properly!,"The world is a funny place...glue that shouldn't stick sticks to the point of tearing the product...and glue that SHOULD stick, doesn't! While unfolding these pads, the little bits of glue used to hold the folded side in during the folding/packing process at the factory..hold so tight that I had to manually pull each glue spot apart...and many times, it tore the pads. If you didn't try to unstick it, and just laid it down, it had a hump in it...a hump any puppy would spy and grab to play with it. Normally I like Natures Miracle products, but I bought a different brand of pads when these ran out. Sorry Nature's Miracle....get cheaper glue that doesn't stick so well! :)"
4,LOVED IT YET FEW PROBLEMS,"This was a great book. Maddy, an abused wife starts fresh in life--arriving back at her Dad's house after many years. The problem I have with the story is the fact that she bounces back seemigly so quickly. I guess this could be the case with abuse victims, but a little unbelievable. However, the story-line is good and the characters shine."
5,FABULOUS!!,Who would have thought that pots and pans would make such a difference! These pots/pans are fantastic - they heat so fast and evenly. I have had NO issues with food sticking to the surface and they have been very easy to clean. Love them!
3,Dim Sum for Everyone is OK,"I expected a little more from this book. A little more storyline, a little more dialogue, a little more substance. I think for an early intro to Dim Sum this books does the job, but lacks a real story. The brief history at the end included good info."
2,Didn't find it inspiring,"Here is a short book, filled with quotes from people of all walks of life. The quotes are loosely categorized into 6 sections in the book: The Fundamentals, Investment, Leadership, Management, Marketing, and Success. The author claims that these quotes should serve to give you words of wisdom or inspiration to a person navigating their life in the business world.But I don't think it does a great job of that. Yes, I do believe that the author picked quotes from some great figures: Catherine the Great, Bill Gates, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Adam Smith, to name a few. However, most of these quotes are not particularly clever. They're just too random, and as a businesswoman myself, they fail to inspire me. These so-called ""principles"" don't have any use in your life.If you really want quotes to inspire the businessperson in you, just google a few quotes and you can find some equally as good, if not better."
4,"Good book, could have been better.","It was a good book with plenty of info. The only problem I have with it is the author says he is not out to sell you on a brand but to give you what you should look for in a product, than tells you, brand X is the absolute best and is available at my retail store. Which is fine and dandy but if he was going to do so, he should not have said he was not. This installment is by the way, 200,000% better than #2. #2, if you are an evolved hunter (past your shoot everything that moves and only trophies will do for me phases) is a complete waist of time. Having said that, if he had a book #3, I would flip threw it to see if he put the sort of information I was hoping for in book 2 down in it. Book 1 (this book) is about how to go to Alaska and hunt, book to is sort of short stories with tidbits of info here and there."
1,"Wrong key, wrong verse order","Many of the songs are in the wrong key, and on some of the songs, the verses are in the wrong order. If you want to sound exactly like the recording, this isn't for you. It is for somebody who sort of wants to sound like the Beatles. There are better books out there."
3,"Adequate, not great","We purchased this for use while skiing. Before the case, we put our portable radios in a pocket. This meant that when someone called, you had to stop, pull out the radio and try to communicate. Having the radio on your arm is better, because it's more accessible. However, the solution has its problems. The arm band holds the radio, but it twists around on the strap and around your arm, so that, while engaged in vigorous activity, it's not staying still. It's better than grabbing it from a pocket, though."
5,Many good ideas here!,"Having recently experienced a scare when a relatively young family member underwent heart surgery, we were looking for ideas on maintaining a healthy body. This book was full of tips that aren't often addressed in traditional medical literature, and we've found many of them helpful and inspiring. Definitely recommend.NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR OF ""NEVER BE LATE AGAIN, 7 CURES FOR THE PUNCTUALLY CHALLENGED."""
4,Secrets of Longevity : a lot of sense!,went through the book quickly. it was very interesting and follows the standard Near Eastern philosophies. It was a very good and concise reference and it has a lot of good information. The information was organized and presented well.
2,Only 2 Stories Worth Reading,"If you enjoyed the opening scenes of Insurrection and Nemesis with all of the social touchy-feely stuff, then you'd like these stories. Most are filled with boring personal interaction and are far from war stories. However, the story of Shinzon's rise is excellent and might even be worth the purchase of this otherwise fireplace fuel. Beware of any book with Greg Cox as an author. He messed up Khan's story and his one effort in this compilation is shameful."
5,Excellent!,"As a Medical Transcriptionist this book is an invaluable resource. I have used it not only to look up the correct spelling of drugs but also to cross reference doseages, generics, and usages. I especially like the indication/therapeutic category index. Many times it is difficult to understand what the physicians dictate, it is helpful to be able to go to the back to see if the drug I think that they have said matches the diagnosis. I highly recommend this book."
2,Beware of plastic,"This poster is laminated with a heavy, permanent plastic coating, making it unsuitable for framing. Also, the original has much more vibrant colors than this reproduction."
3,Same thing,"I have played Donkey Kong for a while now and I think it is an overall great game. The thing I disliked was that it was almost the exact same thing as Banjo and Kazooie. I mean Donkey Kong didn't have a dumb bird in his backpack but I think Rare kinda copied Banjo and Kazooie to save time in producing it. If you don't have Banjo and Kazooie, then buy Donkey Kong, but if you have Banjo and Kazooie, and aren't a Donkey Kong faniatic, then you would probably be wasting your money."
3,Atlas?,"I've bought this atlas after reviewing all the options available on Amazon. This one was apparently the best one in terms of map quality and information available within; I have not seen any other atlas referenced by other reviewers so I will not make comparisons here.I give it only 3 stars because I think an atlas should have LARGE, DETAILED maps in detriment of text (which is available in other types of publications). This is not the case here, where maps are small, and do not cover important aspects or interesting facts (e.g. battlefields); text however is more than adequate, and steals actually space from maps.It is excellent for all the people who need an introduction in history, but for those who are looking for in depth maps and cartographic details, forget it - look somewhere else, though I'm not sure (at least from other readers' point of view) you can find something better.Next time I'll try (and recommend this to you too) to browse the book in store before buying."
1,too heavey etc.,"the thing is very heavy, bottom heavy mostly, and you can burn yourself getting the small removable lid off. also would be easy to lose. if lid is not on it will not shut off automatic.looks cool in photo, but is too much money and not perfect!"
1,Crap,"-The instructions were horrible. I'm a scientist, and the instructions were confusing even me.-The syringe leaks. So much for determining an accurate volume.-The stick on scale for the beaker is not accurate (way off), which added to my sons confusion.-Bottom line, this was a huge disappointment."
1,Poor Service,"very poor packaging, the book arrived with the packaging torn off every corner. I wanted to return it because my school had it's own book to use. Seller had no return policy and was contacted but they never replued to my email so I'm stuck with a 40 sum dollar book I will never use."
4,some of steve martins best,"i allways loved these movies and was happy to see them released on blu ray. the video guality is good, not great. but for the price they are worth the money."
3,The book has no pictures!,"This book was one of 3 we took on our trip last year. It was the worst of the 3 and the information was somewhat dated. Forget going to Londan at the $90 a day price tag. You will hate it, even if your are cheap, like me. Cheap London hotels listed in book are dumps and mostly unsafe. Pros: The book is small and wont take up rome in your back pack. It has some address and numbers if you want to call a place. Although the price of a call is not worth it. It had the best cheap resturants of any of the 3 books. If you dont know, London is expensive. Cons: The book has no pictures! I never trust what the writters of the guides print without pictures. I may feel differently about a place. The book is paper back and pages are of cheap paper.If you can only get one book, make this the last option. Cheers!"
2,Nothing special. Overpriced sampple-size bottle.,You're better off using SeaBreeze to get the same effect. Only burned and did nothing for the overall look and feel of my skin. Tiny bottle which will get used up in no time.
1,the author wants to ride on the religous wave in America,I don't remember any hint of religion in the first two books.But this one obviously wants to appeal to the religous nutcases in America.
1,A bad investment in time and money,"I've used white out products since they first came out and this one is too subject to user error or miscalculation. If you make just one small mistake in the way you hold the pen or apply the white out you'll find the pen is ruined and there's tape and white sticky stuff all over the place and no way to undo it. You have to throw that pen away and use another one, which the manufacturer probably loves. I'd like to see how many people can use this pen without ruining a few along the way. I think many of the older products were superior and easier to use. First time buyers beware and have patience and several of these pens to work with."
2,Incomplete product (and order),This is a backless cover for the screen and sides only; it leaves the back vents exposed to moisture and dust. I received 2 of 5 ordered; the packing slip showed a full order. Should be priced under $5. Quite disappointing all around.
3,Big Star gets some much deserved attention,One of my favorite bands from my college days. This book is the most info about Big Star that I've ever seen in one place.That said the non-participation of the group's founder Alex Chilton leaves many unanswered questions.I'm sure his recollections would have shed much more light on the subject.A good book that could have been a great book.Diana Mercer is the co-author of Your Divorce Advisor and her company [...]
2,Informational but not inspired - for fans only,"The book provides believable and sometimes fascinating information, and the author is to be commended for getting this hard-sell published. But the writing is stilted and surprisingly flat considering the writer is a professional music journalist with a growing list of book credits.If the reader is looking for evangelical fervor - and a writing style that can inspire - they will not find it here.As is always advisable to those who do seek to turn someone on to music - give that person the music of Big Star. Don't give them this book."
2,Great Machine but very delicate,"This is an awesome machine and it looks hot in your kitchen. However, unless you plan on using it only sparingly, don't bother with it. I live and breathe espresso, so I used it at least three times a day or more. It worked perfectly for about a year and then it just stopped working one day - without warning.Id say if you wanna buy it for the looks and plan on using it only once or twice a week - its a great purchase. Otherwise skip it and buy something like the Rancilio Silvia; which Im planning to purchase to replace my non-working Granos."
2,Poor Customer Service,"I received my Granos as a birthday present two years ago. As had already been reported here, the machine is great--when it works. I thought I was the only one who had leak problems but most everyone who wrote a review here reported the same problem. Leak from the bottom and leak from the water container.I called customer service to report the problem and they sounded like they've never heard of the problem. They asked me to return the machine but I didn't bother. A good customer service should have already heard the problem before customers call.A $600 espresso machine should last more than two years. I can't believe a company like Bodum is not concerned about its product. I'm buying another espresso machine and it's not going to be Bodum again."
1,Not worth the money.,"For the first time, I felt greatly disappointed in a book purchased from Amazon. Although the advice in this book is sound, it is also age old with a little added advice for today. Has this book been a movie, I would have waited for it to come out on video. The publishers should consider lowering the price to match the contents, day old and repetitive."
2,Disappointing,"I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed with this book. It's basically just common sense advice we've all heard thousands of times with nothing new to speak of. The writing is so humdrum it just didn't hold my interest. More highly recommended books: Three Black Skirts, The Bombshell Manual of Style."
3,I don't believe this is appropriate for teens,"I have a disclaimer that I didn't read the entire book. I give it 3 stars, because there is some good information in it, and it could be useful for women. But I got this for teens, and I don't think it's appropriate. The sections that I would site are the ones that give the occasions where profanity may be used and you can still be a lady (something I totally disagree with anyway), and about smoking etiquette. Got about that far and realized this was not the book I thought I was getting, and it won't help me for my intended audience."
5,Refresher for modern ladies with power,"As a professional in my mid-twenties, I am all for women in power. This book reminds us that although we have more freedom, we do not need to sacrifice the simple aspects of being a ""lady"". At first glance, I laughed and thought it was ridiculous and demeaning, but after reading through it, I realize it is just reclaiming something that has fallen by the wayside."
1,Does not fit for VW Jetta 2003,"Bought this connector for my 2003 VW Jetta as it says 1986-Up Volkswagen. Totally different connection than my Jetta has, returned right away. Wasted my time. It has to be described better!"
3,"Beautiful product, horrible shipping, poor packaging","This is a beautiful flag case. However, it was very poorly packaged and the first one arrived smashed in on two corners, broken glass, etc. Company was very nice and sent out a replacement by 3 day, but it also was damaged. The damage was slight this time, so I decided to use it rather than bother with it any more. Note to vendor: the little bit of cardboard folded around each corner of the flag case is totally insufficient to protect it, given UPS' brutal treatment of packages."
2,No Vista support,"I've owned a psc805 for three years now, and it is a solid product. Produces excellent sound quality given the relatively cheap speakers it is relegated to drive. I would easily rate it five stars except for two things -- First, it doesn't work with Vista (well, technically, Vista has a driver for it, but the Aurilium software used for configuration doesn't install or run); Second, Philips' support web site is a joke -- at least where this product is concerned.So, here's the irony as I see it: This product is engineered to last ten years (and at $100 original cost it should), but Philips decided to position it as a cheap-peripheral-you're-going-to-throw-away-in-a-year-anyway item."
2,is OK but sort of sucks,"When it is in working order it can be fun but maintenance really sucks. The manual that comes with it is totally useless in terms of keeping it in flying order. I had expected something along the lines of 'if it does this, check this and/or replace that' in the documentation but no. In fact I grantee that if you buy a Blade CP at some point you will be frustrated by something you think you are doing wrong that is really a maintenance issue.If you would rather be out flying than frustrated with not knowing what to fix or how to fix it, I suggest going fixed wing."
1,bad bad bad,"I have tried to work with these guys and still after months, do not have my belts. Don't use them. They don't know their merchandise."
3,remixed and rare,"This single has four songs on it: the album version of got the life, two remixes, and a previously unrealeased song. The two remixes really aren't that good. I'm a fan of most KoRn remixes, but these two are probably the worst two that I've heard. The unreleased song, ""I can remember,"" is really good though, and I would buy the single just for that song."
2,Not whats pictured,"The picture of the first aid kit that unrolls with the gear neatly oragnized inside is NOT what you get. You get a clear plastic bag with everything stuffed in it. Had i known that this did not come in a handy organizing case i would not have bought this particular kit. It says it came with a pvc pouch (8x12) and a waterproof nylon pouch (7 by 10) but i only have the 7x10. Otherwise, its a decent kit. But without the organization of the pouch it didnt come with, its a big hassle to get whatever you are trying to find.Edit:it is also missing the 35 foot nylon cord. it has the 12' and the thread. the compass i came with is useless.the whistle will get you by, but buy a better one."
1,Beware letting your children drink from this contains lead,This is not real china - it is made of dolomite and according to the company it is not a children's tea set at all but ornamental in nature; from the title and look of it this set it is deceiving. Drinking from it may put your children at risk. When it is washed it soaks up water that then can be seen under the glaze - it eventually dries out but causes discoloration. I called the company Royal Doulton with my concerns and they informed me of the lead and the fact that it is not even real china.
4,Wix Hydraulic Oil filter,Wix 57098 (Kubota TA040-37710 equal) arrived in short order and fit as it should. No real concerns considering the filter that was removed was the identical Wix model filter.
2,not for cold weather,"I received a v6000 for christams and was at first very happy. The instructions were clear and I was able to ""calibrate"" it on the first try. Most everything seems to work as advertised but one big gripe is that the unit does not record temperature below 0 deg F. They failed to mention this in the catalog and since I live in Alaska the temperature feature was one of my main reasons for buying this. I figured this out only after the unit kept saying ""under"" and shutting off. After I got into the technical reference I figured out the unit works between 14 and 140 deg F. I think there are lot more places in the US that get closer to 14 then 140. My other gripe is that I hard wired the unit into my vehicle ignition so it would work with the key but you still have to turn in on every time you get in the vehicle. A little more research by the manufacturer would have helped out greatly."
2,This game pretty much [stinks],"... At first, I fell in love with it. But after a while, it was boring. For one, the music got creepy. To select Diddy or Dixey Kong takes getting used to since it's unlike turning to Donkey, pressing A, and getting a high-five. The levels are plain STUPID because of their difficulty and concepts and to go with that, it looks like Atari Jaguar graphics. I only gave it two stars because the first few levels were good until I got stuck on the last level in World 1. Follow your instincts on buying this game, but be careful of impulse..."
2,Sumi-e Detail Lacking,While this book was informative about Sumi-E it did not give detailed information regarding technique. It is more of a general overview rather than something an artist already skilled in the medium can use.
4,Rampa,This is supposed to be the last book Rampa wrote. It has some typos here and there and is abit hard to follow in a few places but it is astounding in its own right as it covers so many topics.
5,yes Volfenhag,i found the speakers sold heavy and they just work very wellthere where no extria complications dealing with the speakersjust an all around good product
2,You get what you pay for,"This mill is good for cracking grains and beans, and that's about it. I ran grain through three times and it still was not usable for bread. If you plan on doing anything beyond making porridge, this is not the mill for you. That said, the price is right if you plan on making cracked cereals or splitting peas."
3,All-in-all,"All in all it is a good scope. But it, quite spefically, states in the name of the product that it comes with ring mounts and yet, it did not. Buy ring mounts along with it if you do not already have them."
2,Not Axis Camera Station Software,"This is not the Axis Camera Station software that the description leads you to believe. This is simply a paper license, with no software included."
4,Awesome!,This Knife was actually better looking in person than in the picture. It came in a nice box with sheathe and shoulder strap. I'm very pleased with this knife and look forward to buying another from this company.
2,Buyer beware !!,"Buyer beware! This is not the same Henrik Ibsen that did all of those great poems on the Laugh-In TV show from the Sixties.I was disappointed at first, but the various episodes were entertaining after a while. There were only a couple of laugh out loud parts but it was different and I was entertained."
3,Missing CDs,"A portion of each lesson is a listening lesson but it comes with no CD. I have searched and don't even know where to get it. Maybe mine was missing this crucial component but without it it's useless. However, as I look at the book I say that the other parts seem to be good."
5,best conceivable recording of the music,"Zanon has technique by the yard and studied all the manuscript evidence available (he writes that early editions of the Etudes were riddled with errors and he's right, I tried learning etude 1 from an early run and was very confused).Armed with his scholarly work and fingers Zanon not only gives the best interpretation of Villa-Lobos solo guitar work I've heard, he also seems to be the only person to have crammed all of V-L's solo guitar works on to a single CD. This is one CD any fan of Villa-Lobos and 20th century classical guitar simply must own."
3,An okay read...but,"A dear friend loaned this book to me, asking that I read it and see what I thought. It was an okay read, but at times I found myself confused in the plot, wondering if Mary was having flashbacks or what. Of course, we all know Mary Magdalene was a special woman in the life of Jesus. This is a work of fiction and I feel the writer just decided to write a fiction story based on perhaps her own personal beliefs, or should I say perhaps the way she wanted to believe it may have happened. This is the first book I've read by this particular author and because I had a hard time staying with the plot, I doubt I read anything else she's written. I feek that fiction writers should stick to fiction and not waver into areas where perhaps they shouldn't go."
1,Useless,"Don't buy this expensive DVD. Get real: do you think anyone could be that genius and teach you everything about trumpet playing in one single DVD? This DVD even wastes time demonstrating what the structure of a trumpet is. It's menu looks quite inclusive, but think about what you can learn about breathing, for example, in fewer than 10 minutes' instruction (it's probably 3 minutes or even shorter, but I don't remember, because I sold it already.)Go find a real teacher. Practice, practice, and practice!"
5,Good Film... ONLY THE ACTOR'S DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS!,"First-Rate Celebs Deserve More Than This! I Feel Bad For Those People In This Film. BUT FOR SOME REASON, I LOVE THIS FILM! This Is Fun, Romantic, Song-Filled, And Dramatic! So If You Love A Good Time And A Good Cry, You'll Love This Film! WARNING: YOU WILL NEED KLEENEX! LOTS OF IT IF YOU GET SAD EASILY!"
1,Expectations dashed - despite the songs -,"I'd forgotten how much I can't stand Mickey Rooney. Hart in ""Zip!"" wrote -""I don't care for either Mickey/Mouse and Rooney make me sickey"". The true story of R&H; would have made a good movie (Rodgers was no plaster saint himself). The only songs I enjoyed in this were Lena Horne's and the concoction they made of ""Thou Swell"" and ""Someone Should Tell Them"" for JuneAllyson. ""Slaughter On 10th Ave"" was shortened (by about 80%) and rewritten. The new plot: Kelly and Vera Ellen dance a few simplistic steps, then get shot. I for one did not think Tom Drake was so bad, not that anything in this mess was very good. Ann Southern BTW actually was in a RH show (""America's Sweetheart"", only her name at the time was Harriet Lake). Gene Kelly at the end as himself says he was in a RH show. But the show wasn't ""On Your Toes"" (source of ""Slaughter""), that was Ray Bolger. It was ""Pal Joey""."
5,Marvelous Picture!,The entire cast is just wonderful! Glenn Close is awesome and Harry Connick Jr. sings so wonderfully. A very nice adaptation of the earlier 1950's version.
2,Sorry.....,Nothing like the original Mitzi Gaynor & Rossano Brazzi Movie. Harry Connick Jr. keeps this production from being a total loss
3,STOP COMPARING IT TO THE ORIGNAL!!!!!,"OK...this IS a remake and it will not be as good as the masterpiece that was made so many years ago. But, the 2001 version did not totally flop. It had some strong points and good music, but of course, not as good as the original cast. But you can't compair a masterpiece to this. If you look at this remake as a movie in itself, it is ok. But i do stress only OK. Not great. Just stop being so hard on it. And don't compare it!"
1,High Schoolers Could Do Better!,"Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein must be turning in their graves with this remake of their delightful (and controversial) musical. I have seen better acting and vocals from high school and community theatres performing this particular musical. This remake contains none of the heart or the character of the original film. Even if that film did not capture the essence of the production as it appears on stage, it is still much better than this tripe."
1,South Pacific Headin' South,"What a bomb! But it is always hard to equal, not to mention surpass, a cultural icon. The ""Enchanted Evening"" song is an outpouring of love and lust from a man deprived of the real thing for 2 decades. In this TV disaster it is a whoosie little ditty; about as convincing as powdered eggs. It's ashame that some young folks may miss the original screenplay (been there, done that) because they have seen this travesty."
1,Horrible...,The book has no Veggietales characters but the peas. Dont buy this unless you really decide that you must have this book since it is not good.
4,The kids love it!,"Both my 4 year old and 2 year old love this book. The story is a little hard to follow, but they don't mind. It has a nice message about sharing and is the perfect length for a bedtime book."
5,Unbelievably good,"I chided myself after buying such a ridiculous item and thought that it would be another kitchen gadget that I would throw out eventually. Actually, I love this thing. I use it all the time. I chop onions and any firm vegetables or fruits in seconds. You can chop all the vegetables that you need for soup or stew in a minute. No kidding."
1,Just doesn't work as well as you would hope.,2 significant problems.1. The little plastic pieces that the top swings on break fairly often and easily. I repaired it using super glue. I super glued it 3 or 4 times until the plastic piece that broke off no longer would fit in the hole in the side. I am now using it with only one little plastic pieces that the top swings on. Any port in a storm.2. Cleaning it is a bear. The little rows of plastic on the top that push whatever you are dicing through the metal piece get full of that material. I usually do 2 or 3 good sized onions at a time. Then I have to take a sharp knife to clean the onion residue out of the plastic rows on the top piece. A dishwasher just won't do it and the little plastic thing they give you to clean it out with will last a couple of months before several of the teeth have broken.
5,A Kitchen Staple,My mom gave me the Vidalia Chop Wizard a couple years ago and I use it at least once a week! I thought it would be a pain to wash the pieces but if you wash them right after using it is simple to clean. We love it for hashbrowns using the small blade. I would definitely buy again and it makes a great wedding gift.
4,LOVE this product! Wish it didn't break...,"I bought this originally about 6-8 months ago and absolutely LOVE IT! But the main flaw is that one of the hinges broke. Since the product is only $20, I will buy another (thinking $20 every 6-8 months is not THAT big of a deal) but if it breaks again, I will probably not buy it again. Wish they made a steardier version!!"
2,Not too impressed,"Used a couple of times. Needs excess pressure to chop anything but eggs. Get yourself a good sharp 8"" chefs knife, much faster after you spend the time to clean this contraption."
2,Not as Easy as Seen on TV,"I bought two. The plastic parts broke after a few months.So I bought an Alligator. It works but I don't like it because it doesn't have a container for the chopped veggies to fall in, rather they pop out the top, usually onto the counter.The Chop Wizard does work, but not as easily as shown on the commericials. You can't put a half onion in and just press. It would jam. You have to chop the veggies and then slam the lid down hard."
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! I got thi home and thought it would be great as I seen on tv not even close. It does not work good at all. Even after using it a few times trying to get it to work right. The onions dont go through and is VERRY hard to close. couldnt get that onion through. Well after all this i scaped it in the g bag. SAVE YOUR MONEY ALL this one is just not worth it (I wish it was. HOPE THIS HELPS
1,lots of effort and little value,"Beware..dont get blinded by all the 4 and 5 star ratings that this product received.Firstly, this product does not even come close to cutting half piece of onion. I had tocut it into quarters, which almost defeats purpose of buyng a chopper.Secondly, i had litrally push myself onto the product to actually get it chopping.Not that easy as you see on tv.Third, lot of pieces get stuck in blades and upper compartment, makingcleanng this product not an easy job"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS,"Was givent to me as a gift for christmas. I use it with almost every meal. Onions, potatoes, carrots, celery, garlic such a breeze to chop, wether your making soups, sauce, homefries etc. I love kitchen gadgets and this is by far the easiest and safest one i have come across."
3,good for those who hate to cry,"i finally gave in to the infomercials and bought this product because i love diced onion in my food but hate my eyes burning for an hour. you still have to cut the onion into smaller pieces but it is better than chopping. you obviously have to put a little force in to the press but with smaller pieces, it is no problem for anyone. it is a little hard to clean, but comes with a cleaning comb. i am happy with my buy and i would recommend it to anyone who spends alot of time cutting onions."
3,Handy when you get it too work,"I got it as a wedding shower gift and I do love having it because it cuts prep time, but the problem is that my husband is the one who has to use it because as other reviewers note, it takes a lot of pressure. I'm 5'2"" and we have normal height counters, and I rarely can get it to work on even small pieces of veggies -- even when I put my full weight on it. However, when it does work, I love that we can wipe off the big stuff and then throw it in the dishwasher. So I guess you take your chances depending how strong you think you are!"
1,"All hype, no help","The Vidalia Chop Wizard looks good in the ad but fails in the kitchen. It probably is good for the muscular, brutish chefs who can slam the lever down dicing the food. However, the average person will find that a sledge hammer is the key to success. It simply takes too much force to operate the slicer. I gave this ""Wizard"" to my sister who has now gained new respect for her knife."
5,Great Timesaver,"I was given this gadgets a gift a year or so ago and put off using it for months...the way I was chopping things was working, so why change, right?Well, I had injured my thumb while chopping onions and I had to make enough pico for 30...so I whipped this baby out. Once I figured out that smaller pieces of onion/tomato/whatever work infinitely better than whole, I was producing pico like a master. I admit that I was skeptical at first but this met and exceeded all of my expectations.Cleanup is a bit of a pain when using the smallest blades, but if you soak it immediately after using (so the stuff doesn't dry on) and then use a bottle brush to clean, it is pretty easy.I now use it at least two times a week to make pico, and I use it to make salsa, hashbrowns, mini apple pies, tacos, salads, and many other things just about every day.Homemade isn't so much work anymore so there is no excuse for fast food."
2,"small, hard to operate.","After seeing this on TV I figured it was worth buying.After working with it on both bell peppers and onions, I've decided the producers of the TV commercial did either or both of these:(1) used semi-rotten vegetables that were soft and easily processed so it appeared easy to use.(2) Put painted glue-on fingernails on a male weightlifter to make the demo appear easy.To be fair, it worked ok, but I did have to slice the bell peppers and onions in quarter pieces to get it to process them (which sort of defeats the purpose)."
2,Only good for (precut) veggies,"Like several others, mine came with a broken hinge. The replacement also broke after 3 usages. It takes all your weight to press large or dense items through the blades; an onion the size of the one pictured would take a strong arm to cut. It's a great idea, but needs to be bigger (for sufficient leverage) and stronger hinges- perhaps metal instead of the little plastic pegs."
2,Disappointed,"I have had 1 of these before. The bottom clear container cracked at the hinge. Used it for about 1 1/2 years. Oh well, I'll get another one. Got another recently and ran thru dishwasher on the top rack. Guess what? Cracked at the hinge. Haven't even used it yet."
2,Not durable .. product broke down by the 10th onion,"The concept is neat -- get rid of the chopping, tears, and agony of chopping a onion by one easy to use gadget.The plastic frame completely broke down by the 10th onion. This is the second onion chopper that I had bought. Needless to say, I'm not buying this product or recommending this product again.I just don't understand, why can't they make this neat product with some carbon fibre or some material that is durable?Another example of a good idea but poor implementation."
1,Hate this product,This product does not work like they show on the commercials. It is very hard to use. I feel like the plastic is going to break if I push too hard on the lid trying to chop things.
2,Excellent--if you have Super-Vision,"We value this book beyond all others we have seen. There is more information and it is better written than the rest. Of course we haven't covered the whole field, although we have several. BUT--do NOT buy the soft cover edition unless you have eyes like an eagle. While the information is there, it is crammed into 1600+ pages of nearly unreadable print, especially by the intended audience which we take to be us seniors. This many pages in a 4x7 inch format produces a book 2 1/2 inches thick It is nearly impossible to juggle the book and a magnifying glass at the same time. The good stuff is there, but it's hard to get out."
2,I would like my money back.,"I kept hearing the commercial for this movie while listening to Dave Ramsey online. It sounded good, and after reading the synopsis, I felt this would be great to watch, and encourage others to do the same. As it stands right now, the only thing I want is the 17 bucks back I spent on the movie.The acting in this movie leaves a little to be desired. My hats off to them for trying, however I am thinking it could have been a little better. And the way the characters act in this movie takes rude and selfishness to a new level.The message is a good one. Put God first. Spend less than you make, and make your money behave the way you want it to.Now, time to sell this thing."
5,Praise God for Pastor Ted Haggard!,My husband and I belong to a non-denominational church.Our Pastors received the vision for becoming a cell church & went to a cell church conference.The book and information we received were so confusing! THIS BOOK fits our church that really focuses on fellowship and community outreach! Ted Haggards book gave my husband and I an exciting vision of how the cell church could work in our church! Chapter 11 was and still is the foundation from which we built upon after our senior Pastor asked us to head the cell ministry!
3,did not gear into full auto,"Garth Ennis is an excellant writer and his first punisher was one of the characters greatest moments. This volume seems to be a collection of offbeat and so-so stories. The first is about two cops who may be ""dirty"" and this is the high light of the volume. There should be more action (Steve Dillion style) but, the story is great and gives you an interesting final impression. The second story is about a mobster who is obsessed with an urban legend. Great action with a bad and corny story. Finally, the third story is about poor people who disapear in the sewers. Tom Mandrake does the art work which is horrible and doesn't suit the punisher. The story is retarded and nothing you want to take the time to read. I wish all the volumes were either like the second or the first volume. This isn't great but, hey, it is the punisher. On a final note why does marvel keep post-poning the streets of laredo."
2,unsure if it is real,"I bought this set after Christmas. The price was better than any of the stores I checked. Everything arrived in great condition in a Royal Doulton box. My mom just gave me all of her OCR china. I notice that the roses, especially the yellow ones, on the china that I bought from Amazon are not nearly as detailed as the roses on her china. The roses on my mom's china are smooth and the roses on the new china have a printed dot texture to them. Also the gold trim on my mom's dishes is much larger than the trim on the new ones. I am unsure if the china that I bought from Amazon is real. I will not buy china here again."
3,Solid but nothing special,If you are in the mood for a solid lo-fi rock and roll experience then pick up Little Barrie's self titled album. While this album will in no way make you re-think your feelings about rock n' roll it's catchy hooks and meandering jams will keep you interested long enough to not feel cheated.
4,Oh...he is one.,"DVD Pro's.1. Being able to freeze frame long enough to see that Bob Cummings is *not* kissing his wife in Frontierland.2. Seeing Frankie and Sammy riding the cars of the Autopia.3. Watching Walt wag his tongue almost lasciviously at the young hostess named ambAssador of Disneyland during its 10'th Anniversary.4. Nice shots of a few of the rides, e.g. Matterhorn.5. Jose explaining how the Tiki-birds' audio-animatronics work.6. Watching foreign professor explain concept of nuclear fission via ping-pong balls and mouse-traps.7. Tiny segment of Song of the South.DVD Con's1. Probably could have all been fit onto one DVD.2. Leonard Maltin as the Narrator.3. Uninteresting menus that don't really indicate well what you're going to see.4. Regurgitated footage through many segments.If you don't have the Disney Channel and have never seen this stuff, it's probably not a bad buy."
4,Wall Planner,"This is a great calendar that I use at work for scheduling work. Although the end of the carton was open when the package was received, the dry-erase pen and calendar were intact. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish the calendar was a little larger to be read from across the room in the office as well as larger day squares for notes."
5,Really is Outstanding,I read 129 books last year and 130 so far this year. This ranks up amongst one of the best books I've ever read. It puts financial princples into simple terms and intertwines wealth with morality and doing good for society. I hope to meet the author one day. Bravo.
2,Lapin's Strawman argument,While i agree with his ideas about how people would best be served by doing business his argument that people are condeming business is wrong. We are condeming the system of usury and the idea that money is capital. Both lead to the destruction of capitalism.
3,All Shall Prosper,"I enjoyed reading this book. Rabbi Lapin explained how using Jewish and Christian principles and practices such as meditation and daily confession can lead to success and wealth in your everyday life. Lapin dispels the belief that money and wealth is not needed in this world; and that only certain people can enjoy a life that is filled with personal accomplishments and triumphs. By putting the principles listed in the book into practice, anyone can have financial success. The chapters are a little slow but it's a good book."
4,Thou Shall Prosper,"I have read Thou Shall Prosper by Daniel Lapin from cover to cover. With the advent of modern society we have gained much but this gain has come at some expense. One of the treasurs we have lost is our understanding of wealth and it's origins. Dr. Lapin provides true insight into the definition of wealth, both real and percived in a literary style that is both informative and entertianing. I would recommend this book to all who seek the truth."
5,Excellent,I thought it was excellent and will read it over and over again! I have given it to one of my sons to read as well.
5,Best Deal Ever!!!,I wanted to look for the perfect gift my older brother this past Christmas. It was my first online purchase & it was so exciting to know I was able to find the best gift that my brother could have ever asked for. And it was extremely cheap too. For less than 50 bucks I was able to get the whole Complete Series. When my brother found just one episode for $40. I know he was looking for all the seasons but struggle to find one or two seasons. And it came in a nice box with all these special features including KITT's red light with the Knight Rider music not to mention the Knight Rider movie as well. This was one the best things I've ever bought & I've bought a couple of stuff now.
5,"WOW,my old dream comes true","As advertised ,this dream kit comes in a very beautiful box design,as if i am touching KITT itself,every show comes on a separate dvd,plus multiple of extras,i never knew about it,i liked the KITT lights and music,i recommend this item to all of my friends,it is a MUST ."
2,solitaire hand held game,"What we don't like about this game is that the numbers on the screen are very small and not easy to see. Our vision is still quite good, so that is not a factor. We will keep it because hand held games are difficult to find in most stores, with all the high tech games available on phones, play stations,etc."
2,It's too small.....,I bought this for a 72 year old person and it is too small for this person to see or to operate.
2,complicated to play,I got this for my mom but it is complicated for her to play and it does not play sound.
3,solitaire game,"game is very slow to respond. some buttons stick. scoring is off at times. with me, it serves its purpose."
2,Solitaire game,I am sorry to say I was not pleased with the product. There was no light on it and it was hard to see in the daytime.
5,Couldn't let it go ...,"Really really enjoyed this book. Down to earth, funny, romantic couple bring the story alive.I kept thinking of it long after I had finished. It. Good read."
4,Indiana Jones meets Goergette Heyer,"Well. How glad am I that I have discovered this author? Sparkling, witty, sexy and exciting the first few pages made me realise that I had stumbled on a gem. How wonderful to find a romance with a marvellous adventure plot, laugh out loud humour and brilliantly drawn characters. Marsha's touch is often irreverent and at times strikingly modern but she never loses touch with her characters or with her readers. I am unashamedly biased towards historical fiction and am delighted to have found such a talented author in this genre."
3,It's ok...,"There is not much to say but that the story was ok. The plot was good, a historical romance with mystery and some bloodshed. But it was the writing that was ok. I was not compelled to not put the book down. I had no issue putting the book down to do something else which was a little sad since the plot was good, just not executed that well. This was a free read so for the cost, this was ok. But I would not spend more than a couple of bucks on this."
3,"Good candles, but in metal cup - not clear","These candles popped up when I did a search for ""clear cup tea lights"" and I got two boxes of them, only to be disappointed when they came. They are in the metal cups. Great candle, burns a long time but not what I wanted. I'm not sure why they come up in a search for clear cup, as they are not that."
5,The Orginal and the Best. Mickey is THE Mouse.,"Mickey and the gang mean as much to me now as they did when I was a kid.This dvd is the one I watch when I've had a bad day or when I'm really tired and I don't want to think!This is perfect to have on hand when kids come over - I don't have any kids of my own - I can put this on and they will watch it and there's no super scary stuff, just good clean fun.I love Finding Nemo and The Lion King but it scares some kids which I totally understand!I have also found that alot of the adults usually end up having desert and coffee in the TV room cause they want to watch Mickey too.Never underestimate the power of the mouse!"
2,What to Do but Not How to Do It,"This book is very good at explaining all the necessary steps of how to approach, meet, and eventually date women. You have to go where they go, build up the courage to talk to them, and set up a date. Once you are aware of these steps, one must practice them. That's all the information that exists in this book. I think most of us already know the steps involved, just not how to proceed with them. If you're looking for anything more than reassurance that the above is the process for meeting women, shy away from this book.Also, how much value can you put in a book that says one should get drunk before trying to talk to women and should begin to smoke, just in case you find a woman who does?"
1,Book is good for humour content only.,"A friend bought me this book as a gag gift. I have developed over the years a knack for meeting and entertaining women in bars and whereever I go, to the point where I have never struck out. If you were to actually try any of the techniques used in this book, you would truly be making a fool out of yourself. It is my sincere hope that no one purchases this book with any hopes that it provides you with solid female-attracting advice. The writers of this book are clearly having a go at the public at large. I envision them to be a couple of guys sitting around in a basement dreaming up ways to pick up women if they ever left the house. It amazes me that not just one person, but that two people could be so in-the-dark about actual dating. I'd challenge either (or both) to a night of on-the-town number-getting competition."
4,Easy big fella keeps getting better and better!,"I have been a fan of Easy Big Fella since before ""Easy Listening"", their first album, I can safely say this band and especially this album ROCKS! Their albums keep getting better and better, with more complex melodies and intricate solos. They also put on quite a stage show! This CD rarely leaves my player at work."
1,Disk 2 is NOT READABLE! And the case is slightly damaged.,Subj! So bad I found out too late and can't return it now.Tried the second DVD on two PCs and one XBOX. Doesn't work.The DVD isn't scratched yet doesn't play.
4,It's a guy thing?,"My husband loves this series, so I bought the boxed set for his birthday ... against my better judgement. Now he sits and laughs his head off, and as long as I don't have to listen to the show, I'm okay with that."
2,Does not translate well to the USA,"Just as Seinfeld doesn't tickle the funny bone of Brits, so this series doesn't work for many Yanks. I was told that this was a hilarious series from the UK. I bought this box set and was never so unamused in my life. Luckily, I was able to sell it over the internet and get my money back. Low budget, obvious jokes, over the top acting- not my cup of tea - or coffee."
5,at last,"ingred bergman as hedda,i've waited 40 yrs for this and i'm not disapointed,bergman,redgrave,richardson,howard can you ask for anything better,a 5 star production..."
2,Kanji from the Start: A Comprehensive Japanese Reader,"When opening this book at the bookstore, I saw the Kanji characters in tables and it looked easy to understand so I bought this book thinking that this book would help me with beginning the process of learning Japanese. However, when re-opening the book, it found it so incredibly technical and hard to undertstand. The book mentioned ""tables 6-7 or table 7"" and there is nothing marked - so I could not find out what tables they were talking about. It had a nice way of listing the Japanese 'particles', but the explainations were so technical that I barely understood them. This book is not for a beginners level."
4,Handy For A Germaphobe Like Me!,"I bought these when I was searching for a small attachable sanitizer for my lunchbox and I am pleased with them. I like that they came in a 4 pack and the clip that hooks it to your item is made of jelly, so it's easy to attach and holds on tightly. These are perfect for lunchboxes and purses and anywhere else a germaphobe like me can find to attach them. I also like that they are easy to refill so you don't have to keep buying more. The only downside is that they were smaller than I thought they would be, so if you use them often, you'll have to refill them every 2-3 days or so. Overall though, it's a very convenient product and I would buy them again."
5,The Best Cat Calendar,This is the best cat calendar on the market. I look forward to reading every new day's page. The pictures are awesome. Every cat lover should have one.
1,"Give us all the episodes, not just a few!","Spin City is one of the greatest TV shows ever, and I would love to have all the episodes, not just a selected few!! This is ridiculous, I have the money, and I am willing to spend it!! But they don't want my money!! Is this stupid or what? And then they scream law and order, when people start downloading the show from the internet for free.. they leave us no choice. I just don't get it.."
5,In The House With MTV's The Real World Seattle,"This book is a MUST for anyone who watched the series. It's packed with loads of info on the cast, and it's full of text and pictures. Plus there's comments from the producers, and they tell you why they casted each cast member. If you liked the series, then you'll love this book. A must for any Real World fan."
3,"It's Good, But I expected More.","After reading Road Rules Journals, which I thought was great, I was extremely disappointed with this. It provided great follow-up info on the Boston cast, but didn't have what I expected about Seattle. I still recommend buying it if you're a fan of these seasons specifically, but if you're a fan of the show itself, it's not necessary. It gave good insight to what the cast members thought about key moments in the season, such as ""The Slap"". It's good, but I expected more!"
5,If you love the past 2 Real World seasons READ THIS!!,"Fun, Informative! Just genuine good Real World Inf"
3,Read it only once...,"This is a nice book with good stories, but I surely won't read it again. It lacks the ""depth"" that makes you come back to a book you read years before."
2,Skip it.,"If you're interested in brief, technically detailed vignettes of US submarine combat in WWII, this is probably worth reading. But as a novel, there's just nothing there. No plot, no character develpoment, dialog is improbable. It basically revolves around two guys who the author WANTS to portray as likable and heroic, but he tries to do that by narrating OTHER PEOPLE praising the protagonists, rather than doing the hard work of making us care about them himself. ""That guy's the best damn submarine captain in the Navy"", ""I never heard aerial combat explained so clearly"", etc. Then there's the improbably back-story of the one protagonist's confusion about what is virtuous behaviour for a married mand and what is not. Hard to beleive a devout Catholic who's smart enough to graduate from Annapolis would be so stymied by such a question."
5,Wow...what a great surprise,"My original shelf had a crack in it...well it was getting longer and longer. Wow was I surprised when I opened this one! It was super sturdy where as the original was ""flimsy""! It fit perfectly and I am SUPER happy with this purchase!"
3,It's okay,"Many people say that it's a great book. And it is pretty good. There are quality ideas in here and many varities to choose from to fit your style. But the ideas were often sort of complicated (don't get me wrong, I'm not impatient or anything) and expensive, all you have to do is look at the room indexes. Often the designer spent hundreds of dollars and incouraged girls to buy new furniture. Also, the ideas in this book can't really be mixed together to create your own one of a kind style, they need to coordinate with their matching ideas. The instruction often do not explain themselves fully, and you are left hanging wondering what to do next. I give this book three stars for having ideas that are mostly too expenisive and a little drawn out."
2,OK but not the greatest book I've ever seen on redecorating,"I purchased this book for my daughter. There are some cute individual ideas in this book, but it is not good for getting an overall theme for redecorating a girl's bedroom. I've seen much better books than this one. I wouldn't waste my money on it. You can find better ideas on the internet for free."
3,"Nice sound, nice features, but way too hot!","A nice unit with good sound. Not great sound mind you, (but hey it's not $1000 either) as I found it sounded a bit too ""wide"" on most settings no matter how I fiddled with it, but set at it's basic functions it sounds well and offers a terrific value. One thing I will complain about is the heat it puts out. I have to put a fan on while using this, because of the tight space in my media cabinet."
3,Less is more,"How can the best music from one of the best bands of all time not make a fantastic Greatest Hits album? If you tamper with the music, that's how.I listened to this and somehow didn't feel right. The CD gathered dust for more than a year, and when I ""rediscovered"" it, didn't feel like playing it. ""Made in Japan"" however...The simple fact is that Deep Purple's music should be listened to the way it was intended to. I still maintain that their live albums are their best albums. Check out the excellent digitally remasteredMade In Japan: The Remastered EditionCD, or check out the DVD section. This one is best avoided."
3,not if you are looking to improve,I would not buy if you seriously planning to go into the hobby of modelling.. it is okay but are better ones
1,Did not get this.,Got another small kit thing instead. Decided not to bother with returns and reshipping of correct item as it would not get here for Christmas.
