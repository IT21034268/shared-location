5,Delicate Silver Roses,"I absolutely love these small rose earrings. They are not too small, and definitely not over-large, which I don't like. The detail is wonderful, and you can wear them with anything."
3,dog leash,I was a little disappointed in the quality of leather used. I have owned other leather leashes and this one is very stiff and somewhat inflexible. It is hard on the hands.
1,Plagued with mistakes... and that's only in the Basketball,"section: A quick perusal reveals:The author misspells Luisa Harris' name twice, Kara Wolters name once. Says Tennessee's Michelle Snow broke a Final Four record with 7 blocks in the 2000 game against Rutgers. True, but that record was quickly destroyed by UConn's Kelly Schumacher as she blocked 10 (no, 9, thank you sally bell) in the 2000 Finals against Snow's Tennessee team. Also says that that Tennessee went undefeated in 1988 (try '98), and that the WNBA Sparks defeated the Sting 3-0 in the playoffs in 2001. The Sparks swept Charlotte in two straight games.And this is only the stuff I absolutely KNOW - as opposed to double checking the material. Shoddy editing does a disservice to the women she intends to celelbrate."
5,Great kit to have around,We have an active family with lots of kids and their friends. This kit has everything you need to repair pool cues plus several pieces of chalk thrown in the bundle. A good purchase for us.
2,My kids don't like the taste,My kids prefer Yummi Bears to these. Neither is overly particular yet these don't seem to taste good to them.
3,Prefer Grape...,We accidentally bought the assorted vitamins (and we love this brand and buy them every month for 3 kids)....but not a huge fan the assorted....would recommend all grape.
1,waste of money,These are the worst tasting vitamins ever. They leave a really bad after taste in your month. Do not waste your money.
5,Great price!,We enjoy this product because it's natural and has no high fructose corn syrup. The price makes it even better.
5,Awesome new artist from Marian Records,"This album has an excellent new group of singers whom I hadn't heard of before, but now I'm hooked. Sarah Taylor's song ""Not Me"" is awesome andt I can't stop listening to it. Hopefully Marian will bring out the single with more versions of it. Let's hear more of Sarah Taylor! The other songs are also good as they have a nice mixture of remakes and original songs."
4,Cute pots,"While these pots are super cute, they are a lot smaller than I thought they would be. I still love them though. The smallest one is the perfect size for a can of soup. YUMM!!"
1,"salon scholarship, deeply flawed first summarization","The deeper flaws in this synoptic summary are suggested by the profusion of factual errors: even names are misspelled, confirming the author's overreliance on the assertions of secondary literature without more than a superficial understanding of the discursive context in which Benjamin's unfinished magnum opus was prepared. Thus the flood of footnotes, over 100 pages of annotation documenting a disappointing hesitance to form opinions based upon original research. Fortunately, Benjamin's Paris ""Arcades Project"" will be appearing imminently in English translation; unfortunately all the serious scholarship or reflections on this work only exists in German or French."
3,Oven Door,"Why must all microwave oven open from right to left? I am in the market for a new oven, but it must open from left to right or any other way except right to left. When you find one, please let me know."
3,MOUNTAIN MONSTER,"Everyone knows what to expect from a SyFy Channel original movie:semi-cheesy effects; average acting; bad dialogue; pedestrian direction, etc. BEHEMOTH won't disappoint.I wish it was a little quicker and we saw more of the creature. X-FILES alumnus William B. Davis brightens things up a little and even has a foxy sidekick.Bottom line: don't expect too much and you'll enjoy BEHEMOTH."
1,bad,"The maneater series has movies ranging from those with acceptable if usually far-fetched plots, tolerable writing, and acting which ranges from indifferent to relatively good on one extreme. The other extreme is total trash. Yes, all these movies call for extreme suspension of disbelief and often the acceptance of main characters with IQs in the single digits, but those are hardly unique in the movie industry. Many are quite enjoyable if you don't take them seriously. Behemoth stands squarely on the trash side of the scale. The plot is absurd, the acting, at best, indifferent, the writing, in a word, bad. The monster is laughable, as is the idea of killing a creature literally the size of a mountain with a single shoulder fired rocket."
2,"Good book, bad for my circumstances","I ordered this for my ex-husband, unfortunately he was lieing about his PTSD symptoms. This just gave him more information to keep lie going."
3,Needs to be updated,"Yes, you can still learn of lot from this book, as noted in the other reviews. But it is now showing its age. This book was written for Sketchup 4.0 when only a time-limited trial was available for free. Sketchup is now at version 6.0 and free from Google (except for the pro version). The advice in this book on how to squeeze a tutorial session into a time-limited trial is just distracting. More importantly, you will not be introduced to the new features in 6.0, such as styles and better organization of model structure. It would be very useful to have Dennis Fukai's advice on how best to use Sketchup 6.0."
2,Bad idea,"A heavily indulgent partnership is barely formed with this unneeded Fishtank session. Tortoise-heads will likely feel sick from all the Ex's noise-slop deconstructionist approach, because nothing really gels between the two aside from fleeting textural curiosities."
2,Avoid spending money on this cd.,"I bought this cd thinking it would sound as good as the previous others, however, it seems that the ex feels the need to ruin great music with terrible vocals. Save your cash, treat yourself to dinner instead. Dissapointment, dissapointment."
3,Previous reviews contain insufficient information.,"As of September 28, 2001 there are two reviews, each of which give this exam guide, by the respective reviewer, one star from five. In both instances, the given reason is that the CD-ROM is not functional. While I agree that this is a sufficient and sensible problem with the publication as a whole, it fails to address the question I have, the question I imagine anyone seeking an exam guide would keep foremost in their judgement... did this book (Amazon / Borders is, after all, at heart a BOOKSTORE, not a software store) serve to better prepare you for the ASVAB?-- And if you cannot use a book without an associated CD then I, for my own part, certainly hope you either didn't take the exam or you failed it. I don't want YOU in the military I mean to join - not in THESE times.PS. I have given this publication one star for the purposes of continuity only - I have not yet seen and can therefore neither endorse nor demean it."
5,Process and Reality,"Do seek out this out-of-print book and discover one of the most profound philosophies of this existence of phenomena, which arose in ancient China between the 5th and 8th centuries A.D. and developed in a very similar form in modern England by Alfred North Whitehead. This book compares and distinguishes the two conceptions, best regarded with the metaphor of Indra's jeweled network where each event is reflected everwhere, a mutual arising and intepenetration. The things we know are not solid nouns but action verbs, gerunds. The book emphasizes Buddhist philosophies and is thick with corollaries that could leave much to ponder. As modern physics has established matter entanglement, these related philosphies are not mere woolgathering but related to psychological experience and laboratory experiment. Other books are still in print that describe Buddhist Hua-Yen, and few examine Whiteheadian process metaphysics. This book is unique in its analysis of both."
4,Fight sequences are totally cool,There is no combat during this video. It is educating and inspiring. He's a good guy.
5,Greatest,The best album I have heard in years! Does not contain one disappointing song. Worth every penny and highly recommended.
2,"waste of paper, and money","A bunch of pretty pictures of major anchorages in the Virgin Islands. Supposedly contains information helpful to navigation but I didn't find any. Nothing here that you can't get free from google earth. Also, it would be idiotic to substitute these ""calendar shots"" for a real chart. Just another entrepreneur preying on the uninformed. Would never have purchased if, as in brick & mortar store, able to look at first."
5,BVI Sail,This is a great tool while sailing in the BVIs we used it on every island approach.... Would not Sail the BVIs without it!
4,Virgin Anchorages Photos,"Excellent photos, probably don't need to vacation there as the photos take you there. Cruisers don't miss this one!"
1,Lowsy mounting options,"I purchased this for my father who recently suffered a heart attack. When I attempted to mount this on his Trek Madone I could not find a good place to mount the sensor. Once mounted the bike computer seemed to function well. However, after a few rides the computer didn't work. A local bike shop managed to temporarily fix the unit during a routine service. Time will tell if this will continue to work. I would not recommend this product due to the installation requirements."
3,Jumping The Nail,"The book ""Jumping The Nail"" was about a few people. They had heard about this jumping place called the Nail. The Nail is a 90 foot hight cliff that hangs over the ocean waves. People say that the ocean is bottomless in that spot. Dru heard about the Nail and wanted to jump, but he also heard that no one had been dared to jump the Nail since about 10 years ago when something terrible had happened to someone. Dru's friend Scooter wants to jump the Nail and their friend Elisa wants to too."
1,The Suicide Jump,I think that Jumping the Nail is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It is a story about a group of friends who find it thrilling to jump off of this 20 storie high rock into water below. The girl that you are reading through the eyes of tries to stop one of her friends from jumping off the rock because she thinks to do that is to mark your own grave. It is a very chilling book and since I only kind of liked it I gave it a 4 stars rating.
4,Jumping the Nail,"I just wanted to say that this book is a page turner. You know when you wanna put a book down when you tired? You won't wanna do it with this book. Its about this teenager jumping a cliff so he can be popular. 3 out of 5 people who have tried this have died. He thinks about it for a while. He can't decide what to do. He has a girlfriend as well. Do you think that he jumped the Nail? Do you think he jumped it with the girlfriend? If you wanna find out, get the book,"
4,"Ah, the memories","Love this band, love this album! Includes the EP as well. Can't go wrong there! If you like Mod style 60's sound, this is a good one!"
5,This IS one of my all time favorite albums!,"The Three O`Clock were one of the most progressive bands of the 1980`s.Unfortunatly,after the loss of their orig. guitarist they lost some of there innocent and timeless appeal.Sixteen Tambourines(their 2nd album)has a 60`s garage band appealwith just the right touch of eclectic new-wave.An excellent disc!"
5,Maybe best Micro/Convection built.,After owning a previous Sharp microwave/convection oven I bought this one. Installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed. Excellent even microwave and oven performance. Highly recommend this product.
4,sharp microwave,"Great help in the installation, smaller oven size than ge or sears. Display could have larger numbers. No handle to open door."
1,Unfit for human consumption.,"The unpleasant smell and greasy appearance were apparent as soon as the can was opened. The caution to not overcook was too late; it already bordered on mush. The vegetables had lost their colors and texture. I didn't know an unground garbonza could be mushy, but they were. It was difficult to imagine why a no-meat soup was SO greasy, and even more difficult to understand why veggie-bean soup needed any kind of vinegar, and this stuff was loaded with the Balsamic variety. I managed to eat 3 spoonfuls before tossing the rest. I will never again subject myself to Amy's GROTESQUE SOUP. I give this a one-star rating because the system will not accept a no-star rating."
4,Always great fun for both dad and kids,"My kids are 3,7,10 and 11. This is one of the few books that I can sit down and have fun with any one of them."
1,october project: different eyes,"This is a different band, essentially, without Mary Fahl's signature vocals, and four other musicians. Tolerable to listen to, but none of the mystical atmosphere of their earlier two albums, and little or no harmony. Disappointing."
2,"BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS, DRY WRITING","The golden first thousand years of Islamic history is the main subject here. It is a fascinating time, indeed. Unfortunately the story is told by these authors in writing as dry as the sands of Arabia. Every key event, from the rise of Muhammad to the Shia-Sunni split to the Ottomans, is described in the manner of a school report. With so many books out these days on Islam and its history, readers can afford to skip this one. The best part of this work is the illustrations. The photos in the inset are among the most beautiful I have seen in a while and keep the book from being a total washout.The authors set out to counter negative views of Islam and encourage religious tolerance in the West. There is nothing wrong with this as such; boring readers to sleep will not assist the process however."
2,History written by art historians,"This book does not give an accurate or chronologicaly coherent description of the birth and rise of Islam. The authors of the book are not Islamic historians, they are art historians writing about an age and culture that did not produce significant works of art. To a person unfamiliar with Islam it seems complete and accurate."
3,Good but caveats,"This unit works good, but here's my beef about it. First of all if you plan on buying this, purchase a IR Blaster at the same time. This electronic unit combines the Beyond TV software which is remote controlled with the Cable or Satellite Tuners remote control. These range from 30.00 to 100.00 and to me it's no small thing. Most of the TIVO like functions wont work without it. Another thing is all the USB ports that you will use. Plan on buying a 4 port USB hub Also. Besides these issues the software and remote are great. Its easy so someone not familiar with it, can pick it up and choose what they want. It gives us Dad's a break!!!"
2,Sadly Disappointing,"I'm a big RJ fan. Started with The Keep a few months ago and couldn't stop. Read the Adversary Series then all the RJ books. I was so geeked for Infernal...and so disappointed after reading it. It totally lacks the creativity, imagination, suspense and unpredictability that marks Wilson's style. I hope he can get back on track with the next one."
1,an extremely weak performance,"The Repairman Jack series has been going downhill for a while, but this was an exceptionally weak performance. The Arab Terrorist thing was poorly done - and come on, do you really want me to believe that RJ can find a terrorist group when the combined forces of the US government cannot? Jack's brother is a total slimeball, and it's impossible to believe he'd do what he did at the end (it is also impossible to believe that Jack would escape his seemingly certain doom at the end). Jack doesn't do much ""fixing"" in this book - only one brief episode - which is unfortunate, since those subplots are always entertaining.Bottom Line: this novel doesn't stand very well by itself, and doesn't advance the overall ""Jack vs The Otherness"" theme of the entire series. If you're a fan of Repairman Jack, you'll probably want to get this from the library rather than buy it, but prepare yourself for disappointment."
4,Dance in Heather by Julie Beard is a 'waltz of a romance',"Plotting revenge all the way to the alter, Lady Tess Farnsworth has planned death for the Earl of Easterby, a slow and painful death in revenge for his rejection of her plea to rescue her father from the flames of the king's neurotic fear of Protestantism. However, upon meeting and relunctantly marrying Richard, The Earl of Easterby, at the kind's command, Tess soon learns that love conquers hate and revenge converts to rejoice with the slow dance of seduction, as only the Earl of Easterby can perform."
1,Do Not Buy,"Though we've had this microwave for several years, last night it actually caught on fire! Thank goodness we only had it set to run for 45 seconds! Do Not Buy!!!!"
1,LED display dead after 1.5 years,"Great microwave except for this. Same thing happened to another Sharp I had and to my mother's - the LED segments started to fade after perhaps a year. 6 months later it is unreadable. Buttons still work, so it's usable, but I will never buy a Sharp microwave again.For you other poor slobs who bought this, the replacement part is CPWBFB070MRU0 - do a web search. I found one for $78. You'll need special screwdriver heads to disassemble your microwave, though - check out Sears', model #47486."
3,Weak ending?,"A cop returns to his hometown with his partner to fight an unseen evil. He is followed by a convict that wants to kill him and must also confront the woman he ran out on. Good read for the most part, but the ending left me a bit confused. Maybe I'm stupid but I couldn't quite figure out who was behind what and why they did it. I think I know but wouldn't bet my life on it. With a stronger ending (which is the most important part of the book) it would have been a five star read. I like questions answered not left up in the air like this book."
3,not really more than meets the eye...,"This game is okay. That pretty much sums it up. It's definitely not more than meets the eye. Sure, it has fantastic graphics, and just about everything in the environments can be picked up, blown up, or smashed, but the gameplay is VERY repetetive, and the controls are often very jumpy. The Decepticons have some of the cooler robots, but they also get a bit repetetive. It's definitely fun to play for a short while, but not over extended periods of time. Rent this one and save your money for the MUCH more worthwhile Transformers film."
3,Not like the movie,"The movie is a 5 stars hands down with two thumbs up... no question bout it.The game has potential it's true, cool graphics, but the cut scenes look like made to get over with fast and even silly comparing the sequence and concept to the movie... and the missions, very repetitive and annoying sometimes... Big trans fan trust me.. but they could've made it perfect instead of almost."
4,Great ensemble piece,"I enjoyed this movie as a great ensemble cast. However, I distinctly remember at least one scene in the original movie that is missing from this version - when the women are returning from burying one of their dead, the Japanese forbid them to sing, so they pick up rocks and tap the rhythm of ""Bolero"". Why would this scene be cut out? It was a pivotal scene. In any case, still a good movie, and I enjoyed seeing so many of my favorite actresses together."
1,More like mighty wimpy loader and misleading,"On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for."
2,no good at all indeed,"I read quite a few reviews on Le Creuset cooking ware, before decided to give this a try: I need a non-stick flying pan, but don't like the chemical coating or manual sealing. Bought it around Christmas 2011, following all the instructions about medium/low heat, add oil etc, still, it started to stick around the center, within a month of lightly use. A few more months now, it sticks just like my stainless steel pan.I was wondering what kind of cooking for those reviewers giving this a 4-5 stars, if they were genuine users. They must be doing only 2-3 minutes of frying eggs. Since for normal frying, say salmon fillet, beef steak, this is clearly not working!"
3,Measurements not clear,"The measurements listed for this pan include the two pouring spouts on either side, so the actual cooking capacity is smaller than expected.I returned the pan and got the next larger size, which is the size we needed and I love the quality of the pan. I will slowly be replacing most of my cookware with Le Creuset. It's expensive, but it's the kind of thing that will last longer than I do."
2,"Great, while it lasted","Beautiful appearance, worked great for a while, then began to vibrate and make loud noises and finally ""died"" after a year or so of minimal use. Would not recommend if you plan to use it more than a year or so."
2,"Looks good and works great when it works, but....","The 530ES stopped working after a few years of use. We bought a second identical unit and the opener latch stopped working after three years of use. We like the unit when it's operational, but the quality just isn't worth the price. After researching the Internet, there are comparable units by GE for less than $200, so we'll give them a try."
5,Great buy!,We were looking to replace the Dacor microwave and found out that Sharp has the same model for over $300 less. There are minor cosmetic differences but other than that exactly the same.
2,Sorry product from a sorry mfg.,Liked the oven but used very little as I have two. Reg. it with Sharp at time of purchase.It quit heating after about 9 months. Gave up on Sharp fixing it & finally used my credit card warrenty to have it repaired. No more Sharp products for my family.
3,it's ok,I bought this to replace a small Sharp microwave with stainless steel interior that I had for 12 years. Sharp didn't make a ss trim kit for it. This one is not up to the great microwave I replaced. I thought it had stainless steel interior and it doesn't. It also makes lots of noise. I wouldn't purchase it again.
1,Horrible product,"This is one of the worst designed and poorly manufactured products of any kind in the world today. Don't expect it to last more than three years -- it is built and designed to die fast. I've already had two, neither of which lasted three years. Unfortunately, I have cabinetry and a cut out designed to take this monstrosity."
5,Review,Odette was received on time and in perfect condition. Exactly what I needed for Christmas to go with the movie.Thank you
3,2princessesmom,"Love Barbie-Odette is a very beautiful one, but the wings have rather pointy tips on them and a 3 year old may poke an eye or hurt themselves on them another way. The crown is flimsy and it broke in half and is still attached to its head. My daughters love them despite it all."
3,The light up wings are great but they fall out all the time.,"My 3 yrs old daughter recently received this for her 3rd bday.. She loves it.. but the probably is the wings fall out all the time.. its adoreable.. but they need to remake this product.. so that the wings SNAP on.. for a better fit.. My daughter is getting upset every time she picks her up her wings fall out..Hope this helps.. I would buy again cause it is an adoreable doll when her wings light up, however,it is also a pain to constantly attach the wings..and I mean constantly..."
1,THE DVD SET CAME IN FLATTENED WITH A SMALL HOLE IN THE BINDER,THE DVD SET CAME IN SHIPPED IN A MAILING POUCH AND CAME FLATTENED WITH A SMALL HOLE IN THE BINDER. SHOULD OF BEEN SHIPPED IN A BOX AND BUBBLE WRAPPED.
3,The Hee Haw Collection-A Salute to Hee Haw,Sorry I cannot rate this as this was a gift to my husband for his birthday. He hasn't even opened them.
2,Falls short...,"I give this book 2 stars out of respect for the great work of a dear colleague who's authored it, but the book really should have been provided as a supplement to his earlier (and very excellent book) on this topic.I'm afraid the Java sample code in this book is horrendously bad (lack of adequate comments, unclear and esoteric syntax, inefficient implementations, etc.). There have been many other books on concurrent and distributed computing on Java before and after this book came out, so I suggest the reader buy this book for the theory, and use a more practical book for application. (Beginners in Java programming should also avoid looking at the code, as they will only pick up poor coding habits that will get them into trouble in a professional work environment)."
1,"cropped, edited, gutted of the key information and almost useless","zero stars: good fire starterAfter reading so many refferences to this book in my research this seemed like an important book to read for myself. Unfortunately no one told me there were at least two versions.The author felt he was doing us a service by ""rejecting"" the ""...whole sections of the work that the Brahmins have written into it, and inventing much they have destroyed:..."" in other words a recent thrashing of the 2500 year old work, and editing it to death, taking out all the Brahmins inserts which apparently had all the curious stuff that so many Ancient mystery researchers refer to.This is an absolutely gutted version of the Ramayana, and probaly needs to be scrapped entirely."
4,is alright...,This bag comes with a charger and rechargeable battaries. The battaries are great themselves... however the charger takes 6 hours to fully charge the battaries.The charger is also bulky and I was worried about it scratching my camera. You can pickup a faster charger (I have one now for only 2 hours... and some charge battaries in 30 minutes!). The bag is roomy... I have 6 spare AA bataries and a memory card in the front pouch and room for more. Then in the main compartment my camera (A303) and charger fit nicely with room to spare.
1,Not explored or explained very well,"This book reads like a travel book, short paragraphs all over the page pointing to pictures that are not very clear. There is really not a lot of explaining, just brief paragraphs referencing information."
5,Good first-religions book,"Bought this to give to my 6 year old who has been forced into believing in Christianity because of her in-laws. I chose this book to let her know there are many other religions out there and not just ones she has been told to believe in is her only choice. This book goes into detail about the whereabouts, the customs, and lots of pictures on many other religions. My daughter loved looking at the pictures while I read her some passages. Highly recommended to help with learning new things."
4,Decent Book.,I had to buy this book for my Comparative Religions course my freshman year. The book is really simplistic and thorough. It can be a bit biased at times but for the most part it is straight to the point. The photography in the book is great.
3,Very general information,"Before I bought this book, I saw the table of contents online then I thought it was a good book about water pumps, but it's not. It is very general. Many of the drawings are not clear and incomprehensible."
4,CD beats on you while simultaneously giving you compliments,"This 6 song recording is the first CD effort by this hardcore/metal band from Rochester, NY. It challenges the listener, on occasion, with off-time, technical riffs and also soothes with nice harmonies. Not for the faint, the vocals are shredding and brutal. I would say that the musicianship is rivaled by the deft lyrical content, both working together to create something more buoyant than just metal but also more progressive than hardcore.For fans of Ire, Botch, Catharsis, Endeavor, Deadguy, etc."
2,Not That Impressed,"I'm giving it 2 stars for several reasons:1. Most of the DVD is in English, not Chinese.2. As a native Mandarin speaker, I'm not that impressed with the quality of Chinese they teach. Some of the phrases they use are rather odd.3. As the other reviewer pointed out, this DVD is rather empty of contents. The whole DVD teaches numbers 1 - 5 and three types of fruits: apple, banana and grapes.I'd have gladly given it 1 star, except that it seems to keep my daughter entertained and she started saying 1-5 in Mandarin since she started watching it."
4,Encourages speaking the language,"Although I've taken many language courses, this is the first time a text book encourages the user to speak the language and makes it easy by repetition and pronunciation aids."
3,Learn Italian the fast and fun way,"I would have rated the book and cassette tapes excellent but just noticed that the Italian-English dictionary in the book was removed. I did not notice this at first until a friend with the book was referring to the handy travel size dictionary that was missing in my book.Because I got the cassette tapes with the book, I would order this again despite my disappointment with not having the dictionary."
2,parts missing,"Just gotten the book. On page 5 their is a short test. Using the words given on the left their is space on the right to write in the word in English. That is great if I knew Italian, the word valige is no where to be found in the book."
1,Read the book instead,"Skip the movie and read the book instead. The movie is miscast and the screenwriters cannibalized the book so badly, I barely recognized the storyline."
2,Blech,"Before I say all the reasons I don't like this book, I'd like to point out that I'm sure its elements are appealing to some readers. We all like different things; I didn't like this one. I did finish it, but only because I have this thing about always finishing whatever I read. Lindsey relies on dialogue and action for this novel. Did I say action? Dear god, what with the beatings and kidnappings and running around, you get the sense that she's covering the complete lack of character development. The hero and heroine had all the usual qualities that romance heroes and heroines do, but they were just incredibly flat and cliched, as if their qualities had been randomly selected from a romance chart or phrase book and then inserted. I cared nothing for either of them, and found the hero to be weak and uninspiring. It was never clear why the characters liked each other; Lindsey never got into their heads. A weak attempt at the romantic historical."
5,Love Only Once,"The 1st book in the Mallory family series, it is wonderful. I love the Mallory's and reading Johanna Lindsey. Listening to the book in the car when I am driving is even better!"
2,The Best of the Mallory Saga,"Although I am not a fan of the Mallory's, well, yes,there are several Mallory's that I enjoyed more than others, the in-law, Nicholas Eden, was the favorite character of this entire clan. Nicholas Eden possessed a dangerous and intriquing character, of course ignoring the forever stifling English 'ton' and their unwritten rules of etiquette made him even more intriquing. Finding the Mallory's and their saga to be slightly 'boring', (but that is my opinion - I'm a fan of history, excitement, and danger), Nicholas Eden and Regina's relunctant marriage, their separation, and comical verbal sparring encourages readers to finish this novel in one 'sitting'."
4,Humanizing an American Icon,"General George S. Patton's younger daughter, Ruth Ellen, has written an interesting and readable memoir about growing up in this military family. The hero is her mother, Mrs. Beatrice Patton.Beginning before World War I, the author takes us on several tours; life on military posts, growing up before radio and television, the folkways and mores of a society where children were raised by nannies.Although replete with anecdotes and family myths that reveal Mrs. Patton's role in the success of her husband, the events and relationships which give her substance in her own right are a major and significant part of the story. Not a hagiography, the author easily and with good taste recounts family matters that would not have been shared with outsiders.For some, the connection to 'Patton' will be the reason to read this book. I think, however, the publisher, The University of Missouri Press, saw this memoir in a much broader context."
1,Danger,"Don't waste your money (and time) on that ancient book.It's shame to offer a 70's book for regular sale! Although it reprinted again in 94, its content remain."
1,Based on flawed assumptions,"This book must be one of the most flawed works I have ever read. It starts with the populist title ""Hitlers willing executioners"". This very first statement is already based on flawed and dangerous assumptions. Firstly, there were 70 million Germans living in Germany in the 30s and 40s. How many of these were war criminals (in Goldhagen's words ""executioners"")? A few thousand certainly, but 70 millions? It is not only a nonsense statement, to equal an entire national group or culture with executioners is just as racist as it can get. If you want to have a decent read about the Holocaust and ""the"" Germans I definitely recommend you to stay away from this exemplary piece of propaganda. It makes me sad to see this book since it is exactly this type of despicable racism reducing an entire people to ""evil beings"" which lead to the suffering Jews had to endure in their history. When will we ever stop being racist and start judging people on an individual basis?"
1,racist propaganda,"The cover of this book makes the author's intentions obvious, to permanently brand the German identity with guilt.Inside the covers, you will find much selective information that supports the author's thesis- but you won't find a sincerely objective effort to present the truth.One can't blame all the Muslims of the world for the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, and neither can you blame ordinary Germans for everything that happened during WWII. How offensive that a personal vendetta against an entire people should be masked as academic research."
3,"Captivating, yet resentful","Not being a scholar of the Holocaust, I cannot and will not judge the correctness of the facts and hypotheses presented here. This is a captivating book, yet it left me with a sour aftertaste: it seems to be motivated, at least in part, by resentment. And this (however justified) often spoils the pleasure of reading."
3,Read between Goldhagen's lines and a pretty good book emerge,"This book was definitely written with an agenda. I made myself read it through, but continued to stumble over the author's ill disguised attacks on the German people. If you're a fan of the idea of 'Collective Guilt,' you'll love it. If you're impartial/undecided it'll offer both rewards and some head-shaking. If you believe the rise of National Socialism, Nazi style, was a product of the Prussian military legacy, economic collapse and an unjust treaty - with little to do with some malignant nature of German society - then save your money."
1,Difficult to read with nothing new in it,"As a holocaust survivor who was deported from Cologne, Germany, in 1938,I have read this literature extensively. Despite the media hype, there's not much new here. In addition, the use of certain mandatory dissertation terms (e.g., ""cognitive modeling"" is repeated throughout r/n ""thinking about..."") is tedious and ad nauseum at best, and unnecesary at worst. All in all an important book, poorly written. Also, where are the Gypsies (just given 2 lines by the author), who were as, or more poorly, treated than the Jews? Let's have numbers and paticulars about these victims of the willing executioners. This is not a book about Jews, or at least should not be; it's about the victims of the ZEITGEIST and zenophobia, or at least it should be."
2,Accurate but far from well written!,"This book does not bring anything new to the table. Indeed the facts stated are all part of the sad history of the German fascist mentality. It is an interesting account for those not familiar with the German actions of the time. My objections are in the writing style, this is poorly written making it quite boring to go through 600 pages."
1,"Dry, academic, and completely mistitled.","Having lived in Germany in the 80s and having had conversations with many ordinary German soldiers from the WWII era, I have always been very interested in how ordinary people contributed to the Holocaust. Unfortunately, after reading this book cover to cover I don't know any more than I did before. It is essentially a regurgitation of dry facts and numbers that read like a bad doctoral thesis - which I suspect it is. It is almost unbearable to read in its verbosity and banality. There needs to be something informative and meaningful on this subject that puts a human face on the consequences of inaction, peer pressure, and the darker side of nationalism. This book sure isn't it."
3,Audio out of sync,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the picture and sound are awesome. However the audio is out of sync, more so on the stereo version than the 5.1. It is inexcusable for them to be this sloppy with the transfer. It's my 1st concert on bluray so I can deal with the 5.1 transfer, but still a sorry effort. Also, it's much cheaper on Metallica's website."
3,the reluctant bridegroom,"this is a book series of 10,,,,have enjoyed the whole series. I shall order more in the future I am sure..Right at the moment I am into another book. thanks for your help."
2,Good Lyrics Lost in Poor Recording,"After listening to this CD on three separate CD players, I'm convinced that this CD was poorly recorded -- Pizzarelli is crooning along so quietly that in order to hear him, the volume has to be increased -- and then, you guessed it, the band overtakes and blasts so loud that the volume has to be turned down. This happened throughout the CD. After the hype from the three reviews I read before purchasing, its an understatement to say that I am disappointed in the quality."
1,Counterfeit!!!!,"The reason that BargainCell is selling this battery so cheap is because it is counterfeit. It did not work in my cell phone at all!!! I recommend only getting this battery from Nokia or from your cell phone provider (Cingular, etc)."
1,Junk Battery,"The battery I received was not what I thought I was purchasing and it did not last anywhere near as long as the original battery. It seems most OEM cellphone batteries being offered by these resellers are used, counterfeit or both. In my experience, you are better off spending a little more buying directly from Amazon (Lenmar Cellular Phone Battery for Nokia 1100, 2610, 6030, 6085, 6555 Series) or the phone manufacturer. For older phones, RdoShck or batteriesdotcom tend to offer higher quality batteries with long warranties that are truly new and they don't hassle you with returns."
5,-Kelly is Going Through Her Own Changes!,"~*~ Kelly Osbourne ~*~Kelly went from daddy's little girl to a grown teenager. Kelly has produced 2 CD's , to tell you the truth the 2nd is better than the 1st. Shut Up her first CD has one less song than her BRAND NEW CD Changes. Her new song ""Changes"" is sung with her father, Ozzy. ""Changes explains how she is leaving her ""best friend"" also known as Ozzy. Kelly is setting off on her own because she believes that she is grown and doesn't need Sharon or Ozzy's support anymore. Kelly is now my one and only, all time favorite artist OF ALL TIMES!!!"
1,IS IT DEAD YET!!,Yup its still bad! I don't care how many bonus tracks it has... Its still a terrible album! She should have just made a new one and started over!!
5,Kelly continues to take my breathe away..,"Her live tracks are wonderful. Her Duet with Ozzy is awesome. Her cd ""Changes"" is awesome. All the songs are great, cant stop listening to all of them! You wont be disappointed with this cd!"
5,music for the millenium,"If you love rock,jazz,and alternative, this CD is all of this and more. Actually there is no way to explain how Jamaroquai hits your bottom soul. If an individual truly loves music then this group is and always has been something to listen to."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Ordinary monster in the city tale. One of those cheap supermarket 50c books.Or, why not to flush reptiles into the sewer and that whole myth."
1,I hate these jeans!,"These were HUGE on me. To the point where they'd fall down, besides that the legs are really flared out at the bottom."
4,Makes it Easy,Thanks to the Authors for this book...it is simplified and summarized in a way that really gets you to the point with alots of practice & Exs...I am a HND in AE student and also preparing for my JAR 66...It is the perfect book for modules 1 2 3 4 & 8 and more..if you were looking for more.
1,I have not received the book.I cannot pay for the book if I do not receive it.,Today is 28/8/2005 .I have not received the book which I had purchased on 7/20/2005. I can not pay for the book if I do not receive it.
5,The wonderful luciano,"HIS VOICE AND HIS LYRICS ARE A GREAT INSPIRATION TO ALL WHO ENCOUNTER THIS REGGAE ARTIST, HE COMES IN THE FORM AND TALENT TO MATCH BOB MARLEY'S. THE ENTIRE ALBUM IS GREAT."
2,For the Amateur,"This dvd biography only scratches a small surface to Malcolm X. This dvd is recommended for the amateur to the person, to the cause, to the movement. I would recommend this dvd ONLY if you have never had any exposure to Malcolm X. It's only about 30 minutes in length. It gives a poor description of Malcolm X. It does not show any footage that you can't see for free at the public library. It is overpriced and probably not worth spending the enormous retail suggested price."
3,not for learning javascript,"I'm a true beginner. I've been learning javascript, and this is definitely not the book for that. It claims to teach, but it doesn't, not really. I have to admit it does explain the techniques and examples used, but the style in which this book is written I did not find very conducive to learning the language. This is more like a compilation of the most commonly used scripts. The examples are made to be applied immediately in webpages. I did dip into it and use one or two scripts, but for the most part I did not get that much out of it(other than the pleasure of viewing the pretty pink swirly pattern on the cover and throughout the book).I would compare this book's offerings to fast food: it all comes prepared, and the most you'll have to do is squeeze some ketchup on top of it. You won't be stepping into the kitchen.I found JavaScript Programming for the Absolute Beginner, by Andy Harris, much better for learning javascript concepts and syntax."
2,examples don't work,"I tried to do the autoscroll example from chapter three. I started with the samples I downloaded and unzipped from the O'Reilly site. The first thing I noticed was that the picture in the samples was different from the picture in the book (no bother there), but then I noticed the picture was not really big enough to fill up the full width of the page, much less be big enough to scroll.I went to a site which had panoramas so I could find a picture big enough for the exercise, and finished writing the page. But when I tried it out, the script didn't work at all. Not being an expert, I assumed that I had done the exercise incorrectly, but when I tried the example downloaded from the O'Reilly website-- it didn't work either!!!Also, I noticed the code example in the book did not match the sample document from the downloaded .zip file.You would think they would have the bugs worked out by now: it IS, after all, the Second Edition!"
5,ONE OF MANY ROSANNE CLASSICS,I'll admit I am biased when it comes to Rosanne. I love every album that she comes out with and the Wheel is no exception. Great album from start to finish.
5,Five Stars!,"As a new mom I'm trying to read as many books written by LDS moms on parenting and being a mother in order to create the home, family, and mother that I dreamed about when I was little. I loved this book! It made me laugh and smile and I felt that I learned so much. It's one I've actually bought which says a lot because we have such limited space. I think it's important to realize that what works for one family doesn't always work for another family. We should learn what we can from others and be cautious about criticizing them. I don't agree with EVERYTHING in the book (who agrees with everything someone else says?), but I think it's a GREAT book."
1,Great Fun,"My family gathered round and took turns reading the stupid and funny parts out loud. There were plenty. This book must be in the wrong category as it should be in humor. Parts of it reminded me of the Julia Roberts movie in which her husband was abusing her. The charater had to keep the cans turned the right way, toilet paper just right etc. I'd like the author to write a sequel to tell us how her children turned out and what, if any, medication she had to start taking."
4,Good stuff,"Crackin' good album mate... Malkmus seems a little free of his Pavement obligations, and constructs some good, fun songs to purify himself. His elegy of Church on White to his good friend and his snarky send up of Jen and the Ess-Dog both work just as well, hand in hand on this album. I love the Hook, but mostly, my heart lies with ""Troubbble"", this is the album that N'Sync hopes to write after that blond one gets back from his aborted Russian space trip."
5,loosen up and you'll see,"I love this album. Absolutely love it. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the ""good"" Pavement records. S&E, CRCR, Wowee Zowee can't be touched. But I do like it better than Terror Twilight and BTC. You knew where Pavement and Malkmus were going. They steadily ironed out all the rough edges and dissonance by their fourth album. Malkmus' solo debut is the culmination of that process, being really, really poppy. The complexity of early Pavement is pretty much gone, and the joker personality of SM is in full effect here. But there are some achingly beautiful songs here, like Trojan Curfew, Church on White, Pink India, Deado... Then there's the goofy, fun stuff, like the sound effects in Troubble, the steel drum in Vague Space and the lyrics of the pirate tale, The Hook. Oh, and Jenny and the Ess-dog sounds just like Spit on a Stranger. But who cares? Lighten up and listen to it again. You'll like it. Trust me."
4,An Action Packed Adventure ...,"Alloria Rising, the first in an exciting new series by author Nick Sherrod, is definitely worth a read. Sherrod convincingly creates an imaginitive new world of magic, adventure and coming of age. In this first glimpse at the world of Alloria, budding young MageKing Nic Alloria comes into his powers, battles the forces of darkness and finds true love. The mile-a-minute pace will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you looking forward to the next installment. Someone should option the video game rights!"
4,Great book! But why haven't the sequels been published?,"This is a great read for fantasy lovers, the only reason I rated it with 4 stars being the sequels haven't been published yet. I was privileged enough to know Nick in high school through a mutual friend and was able to obtain copies of the unpublished 3 sequels to this book! They are FANTASTIC! In order they follow:The Trench of SkullsThe Great ShiftLegions of the SunThe stories continue, the characters become far more in depth, they age, make mistakes, and contain perfectly crafted imperfections. The writing improves as well, with Nick eventually crafting an entire world with separate and complex cultures and peoples. I'm not sure if they will ever get published, but they should! Soon!"
4,Challenges,"I have enjoyed the Bourne movie franchise and have been haunted by the song Extreme Ways that is featured in the end credits. I often repeat it when it comes up in a playlist. The other songs on the album are challenging for me as I prefer less modern genres, but I am expanding my tastes. I don't know if I'll have as many Moby albums in 30 or 40 years as I have Rolling Stone albums, but there is a possibility that I may."
4,GOOD!,"Wanted a some songs from Moby, so I bought this thinking it was going to be good. It's not bad but I need to research my album information more. I ended up liking 70% of the songs on this album, but nothing really WOW'd me."
3,Disappointing,"This, the second Jacqueline Kirby mystery, was a terrible disappointment. The mystery evolves around the going-ons of a English country house party, attended by a bunch of ho-hum characters. When they start to die, it gives Jacqueline a mystery to solve, but the people are so unlikable you can't help but think, ""Why bother?"" And Ms. Kirby comes off as somewhat mean-spirited in this one. Oh well."
2,Not the best...,"I only ordered this CD for the song, ""Two Occassions"" - but hoping the rest of the songs were just as good. I've heard some of his other CD's and they are much better than this one."
1,Disappointing,"Even though I love Evelyn Glennie, this disc is a disappoinment. Too little time is spent actually showing her play: these few and far between moments are the best parts. The rest is a bore. We all know what the noisy world sounds like!"
2,The most boring documentary... at least in the past year,"1. If you're a PBS type of person, who prides oneself on learning more than entertainment, this film may be of interest. And... it was of interest to me because of the subject matter and due to my interest in music, especially percussion, I thought this would be an excellent documentary. While the subject of this film may be very worthwhile, the actual film itself... well, basically it'll bore most humans to death. The only thing that'll wake them up is the jam session on top of the roof in NYC.2. Bottomline: If you pride yourself on being a sophisticated intellect--> you may enjoy this film. If you're an ordinary person wanting at least 30% entertainment out of a documentary film, then save your time and money by skipping this film."
5,Listen Across The Border,"This documentary is very much in the same style and aesthetic as ""Step Across The Border,"" the 2003 documentary on Fred Frith. In fact Fred co-stars as he and Evelyn Glennie, the deaf percussionist, prepare tracks for a new album. Recorded all around the world, with at least three different hair colors, Glennie is a mesmerizing presence, attuned to sounds and rhythms that most of us pass over unconsciously. She gives quiet lessons in participating in life -- in accommodating so-called handicaps -- in striking out in new directions -- and in being connected to the instrument of your body.Thought provoking, remarkably filmed and a damn sight more interesting musically than any of her CDs!"
2,Disappointed is an Understatement,I expected more from this movie and it just didn't hold up. There were a few funny parts but it felt like watching a comedian trying so hard but bombing left and right. I might like it more if I were an 8th grade boy....
1,Horrible,My husband and I are fans of Sacha Baron Cohen's prior films and were looking forward to some laughs with this movie but we couldn't even finish watching it. It seemed completely different than his previous work. It was a huge let down.
1,Blows,"Im sorry, but this movie was good until he came to america. then it sucked, badly. Terrible. Borat is still his best piece."
3,It was okay,Amazon always makes it easy to watch my favorite tv shows and movies online. This movie was okay. Not as funny as I was expecting.
1,The Dictator - one of the worst movies I've seen,Definitely would NOT recommend. The Dictator was funny in parts but went beyond funny and well into stupid. I couldn't wait for it to end - good thing I only rented this one.
2,ugh why!,"found this one to be rather predictable and boring. while there were some very funny parts it, it was just very lacking in the thought department."
2,Definitely a movie for teens.,I rented this movie because the kids really wanted to see it. Definitely not one I would have chosen. This is definitely one of those movies geared towards teens with all of the inuendos and silly scripts. Glad I did not pay to see this in a theater. All of the funniest parts were in the trailer.
1,Stupid movie filled with hatred and racism.,"This is the stupidest comedy movie I have ever seen in my life. The director emphasized on sexual content to make it funny, but it was not funny at all. It's filled with hatred and racism and does not contribute to the multi-culture society that we live in. In fact, it encourages racism against minorities in the American society. I thought Borat was a hateful movie, yet this one has over passed it."
1,A waste of time and talent.,This film was dreadful and a bore. The jokes were tired and I can't even recall laughing once. I expected much more from Cohen. I think he should stick to other people's projects.
3,"Funny, but very, VERY dumb","Sacha Baron Cohen drops plenty of good gags in this movie, but the plot is very silly. Reminds me a lot of ""Zohan""."
3,eh.. could have been a lot better,This movie could have been a lot better. Thus movie was played up to be much more than it really delivered. Glad I only rented it
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,Pretend like there are NO STARS highlighted. It doesn't even deserve a one. Rented the movie for teenagers. Even they didn't find it humorous and... didn't even make it to the end of the movie before they had enough. TERRIBLE MOVIE. Totally lame/warped. Save your money and time.
1,Awful,"Too much cussing and i just plain ole did not like it. I did not go that far into the movie before i turned it off, Disgusted!!"
1,Waste of time,"Look, I get the Sacha Baron Cohen schtick...sometimes I even laugh. But this just felt like an exercise in going through the motions. I'm still waiting for my first laugh months later."
1,"Worst movie ever, Nothing like Borat","I rented this movie because I enjoyed watching Borat. However, this is nothing like Borat. Worst Movie ever! Do not waste your time nor your money."
2,"Rude, Crude, Lewd & Socially Unacceptable",Meets all the criteria necessary to be a hit with today's 20-somethings. Requires absolutely no thought or concentration to enjoy. The mindless masses should lovd it! Not my cup of tea. Waste of my time and money.
4,HILARIOUS,if you dont get affended its absolutely brilliant. it is a bit off at sometimes and sometimes it does not make sense but overall it gets a solid 4/5
2,Not great,"I enjoyed Ali G, Borat, and Bruno.In this movie Cohen goes away from shocking real people with his character and creates a completely fictional movie. It's not very good. I got bored after 30 min because I realized I had only laughed once/twice and didn't care to finish the movie.Cohen needs to get back to his genuine characters and duping real people. He's great at it. This stuff, not so much."
1,Huge Letdown,"I really enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen and think he is a talented actor. Borat was offensive, but terribly funny and that is what I thought I would get from this movie as well. I rarely ever go to the theater anymore because of costly prices, and let me say I wish I would have waited for the rental. The storyline could have been so much better,as this movie left me frowning more than it did laughing. To me it was dull and slow moving. My advice? Don't waste your time, but if you must save your money and rent it."
4,awesome,i loved the movie . even tho i didnt know any of the actors but this movie made me laugh . the only reason i gave it ah 4 star was because i think it should of been longer :)
3,Good laughs,"This film made me laugh, but nothing quotable. It was the sort of comedy where in the moment it was brilliant."
2,"Just watch the trailer, since all the funny parts are in it.","This movie was disappointing when compared to ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"". Baron Cohen's portrayal of those two characters, plus Ali G and Jean Girard, gave me hope that this movie would be just as funny as his others, but it doesn't come close to their level of hilarity. The only halfway entertaining scenes were the ones shown in the previews. Thank goodness I only rented the movie rather than buying it or seeing it in the theater. I am still a fan of the man and his work, but this movie stunk."
3,Such Potential... But Sadly it fizzles out,"This movie had the potential to be hilarious on the level of borat++, however it was watered down, and instead a cheezy ""love connection"" occurs.Written almost with the standard ""date movie"" formula, it's predictibility was disappointing.Basically - You trade the awkward social tension style comedy that ""borat"" is known for, and invert it.It would make a pretty lousy date movie IMO, but it meets the criteria.If you are expecting comedy like borat, you will be sadly disappointed.Not bad - I'd say a 2.5/5"
1,The end,"This movie's not very funny and 95% of the time goes for the lowest of low brow jokes. I genuinely laughed a handful of times, but for the most part was watching this hoping it would get better. It never did."
1,"How did this slow, lazy mess even happen?","Breaking News: apparently Arab dictators don't like Jews and treat women badly. Someone should make another comedy about it. Oh, they did.Baron Cohen struggles with the accent throughout this long-winded mess of an alleged 'comedy'. The plot is boring, the scenarios stupid and the stereotypes are completely predictable.Do Baron Cohen and Larry Charles not realize that we GET IT ALREADY? We know that 'Arab dictators' don't like Jews and treat women badly. Enough!Puerile nonsense."
1,Sucked,I actually liked Borat. This movie sucked a big one. I shut it off after fifteen minutes. Waste of money.
3,horrible artwork for this amazon edition,"i felt awful when i first saw the cover art. i thought it was just unconfirmed.if u see the original cover, that looks way better.waited almost a month for it.not worth it"
3,"Entertaining, but hard to watch sometimes","This movie had its funny moments, no doubt, and was worth the purchase. However, the humor sometimes goes overboard into too much sillyness, which of course is expected."
2,expires within 7 months of buying,"the actual product probably works good but their customer service is terrible, and it expires 7 months after purchase so be sure to use it quickly after buying"
5,Excellent anthology,"This is my favorite anthology of creative nonfiction, and I'm considering its use in a college writing class because of the skill and craftsmanship of its contributors."
3,good brush but can be found cheaper,I bought this same brush under a different name at a local record store for 10 dollars. It works as good as any brush. Like it has been said you push it with the bristles facing towards the driection your pushing to get all most of the dust out.
3,Eh.,"I own this and Discwasher D4 kit. I much prefer the D4. This thing doesn't do a decent job of getting anything but the very topmost layer of surface dust off of the vinyl, while my discwasher brush (without any solution, mind you), does a much better job. And I paid less for it. I don't recommend buying this brush. Instead, go with the D4."
2,Belief is the key.,"The version I picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops. If you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device. Speaking more pragmatically, I've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc."
4,A decent purchase,"This brush does more or less what it says it does. It's useful for lifting stray fibers and dust off of your records, but not much more. It is certainly not a product for cleaning dirty records. The instructions are extremely vague, and one should expect to have to figure this thing out on their own. Even still, it isn't that difficult to use. The brush is a decent purchase in the end due to the fact that there isn't much else out there that could do its job."
4,does the job,"I got this to clean my records prior to digitizing with a USB turntable. First I used a swiffer duster to get most of the dust off, followed by a couple of passes with the Audioquest."
2,Poor record cleaner,"I'm pretty particular about having clean records, and when I use this brush I find it very inadequate. As others have reported, it will scratch the surface of your record! This may not be an audible type scratch, but I'm not sure about that. The way to view it scratching is to slide it onto a portion of the record near the center where there are no groves....... Under normal use I've watched with a flash light to see if I'm picking up anything....... and unless it is laying on the surface of the record it's not coming off. On another turntable I use an old ESL dust arm that is far more successful in aiding in keeping the surface as clean as possible while playing. Unfortunately that dust arm is no where to be found these days...... but there is a new type that is similar available on the internet that I will try out soon."
5,Streams in the Desert,These devotional readings are especially helpful to those who are suffering or have suffered some type of loss or down time in the past.
5,Wonderful Devotional That Has Passed the Test of Time,"I purchase this as a gift to my sister. She loves this book. I have one that I got through the amazon vine program. It was so good that I talked her into getting a copy on her Nook. While she is glad to have it on her Nook, she really is enjoying having a paper copy to hold in her hands. Mine has many pages turned down so that I can find the best of the best really quickly. It is absolutely the best devotional I have ever read."
5,Streams in the Desert,Book arrived in good condition as expected. I love the book and wanted to share it!!
5,Encouraging for any trial,"A copy of this book was given to me by a friend when my mother passed away. It turned out that I was experiencing some big rebellion from my teenage daughter at the time that was even more difficult to go through at times. I found that reading these short devotions each day helped give me perspective and peace. I would recommend it to anyone going through loss of loved one, divorce, rebellion, financial trouble, anything."
4,A very good introduction to the Tibetan vision of Buddhism.,"From the introduction which gives a summary of the history of Tibetan Buddhism to the poems by the Dalai Lama at the end, Thurman introduces the spirit of Tibetan Buddhism to those who may be primarily familiar with Zen Buddhism. The selections, mostly poetic works, give a good cross-section and through-time view of Buddhism.Some things are glossed over, for those who are not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism. The role of the gods is not thoroughly explained. Where do the gods originate? From Bon? From Indian Religion. In general, I found this a very interesting and useful book."
2,Motorola Q a nice looking limited features phone.,"After 6 months of being using the Q, I believe I would've been better with a Palm Treo 650-700. The Q looks great and feels comfortable in my back pocket, but, the software is confusing, the keys so dificult to find ( specialy if you are almost 50 yo). Now lets talk about all in one funtionallity, I still cannot find a comfortable compatible headset for it to play my music, the bluetooth ones are lousy, big and the quiality terrible. The inear wired ones are not compatible, and the mini usb offered by some internet dealers simply don't work and do not even think about an adaptor. So I still carry my Ipod . If I could start all over again I will stick with the treo... What Motorola was thinking...and please don't make me talk about battery life......bad...."
2,"wins for style, lacks function","I had been waiting for months for this phone to replace my blackberry 7100. I wanted something new, modern and cool. I received it. Unfortunately it comes with another loser from microsoft. With the blackberry, use was intuitive, items well organized and layed out. Sure there were limitations, but you easily adapted. This phone makes everything take 1-2 extra steps, but then, those same steps might not work the next time. I can go feature by feature, but let's just say, you shouldn't have to work to use a phone/pda. If you go with the Q, remember very hot, quite a bit bitchy. Choose your relationship"
2,Poor sound quality,"I sent for my second replacement. Nearly everyone on the other end says they hear an echo or just terrible sound quality from my end. What a waste of time. Had internet but a waste of time at $40 per month from Verizon. All other features are mostly ok. Won't work on my mac and the one time I tried to download games or do updates on the pc, it didn't work."
3,"Great idea, still alot of bugs.","I loved the idea of this phone. I ended up returning it due to terrible battery life. Also, there are many bugs in IE and the Email client.In addition, Verizon's EvDO network seems slow on this device."
1,multiple problems with basic service,"I have owned the Q since August, 2006. I wish I'd bought a Blackberry. The Q has very good reception. The email reception is great - until it freezes up with an ""Error"" message, which happens weekly. I then lose email access. It's not a good sign when you have the phone HELP number tatooed to your wrist! The IT guy at work has asked me to get rid of it. I need a phone and I need to receive work email at any time. The Q is unreliable for email, and that just doesn't make the grade, no matter how many other features it has."
5,Nice picture,"Excellent on all points. This projector is easy to use, has an excellent picture, is essentially silent and the price Amazon had it for was untouchable. It's the way to go if you want to step up to HD DLP projection. Don't skimp on your screen though. Complement this device with the best screen you can get and you'll be very happy."
3,Cien sonetos de amor Pablo Neruda,"I chose that rating because the translations are not the best/poor. I'm bilingual, not a professional translator by any means, but I could have done a better job in some of those translations. I gave the book away as a gift and felt a little guilty because the person, who doesn't speak spanish, will question my praising Pablo Neruda's poems."
5,Love It!!,This show was my only reason for tuning to the family channel. I love it and would recommend it to everyone. Never mention the Brotherhood of the Pointy Stick!!
4,Nice sandals,"Quality sandals, the colors are a little more alive than I expected but am happy with the slides."
5,My favorite show,"I have all 6 seasons of The Closer and have pre-ordered the 7th. Just the best series on TV. Will miss all the characters when the 7th season comes to an end, and along with it the series as well. Sad to see them go. Love every one of them!!"
3,Compiling patterns,"3 1/2Even if this early compilation can feel more like a testing of production waters than full-fledged commitment, especially given Bola's inclination for subtly and layering in future efforts, there is still some great old-school idm to be found which lays much groundwork for further expansions."
1,Black River,"Didn't like the book at all. If this is Mr Cucarese's first book, it should be his last. Do not read!!!"
1,No Hope,"Not another book about New Hope, This guy must not live there because this book was nothing like New Hope. This is the worst book ever."
4,Easy Rider Steering Knob,This is a very good product. Very strong. Has a great mounting system. Well worth the money..
2,flexible,"I purchased this spinner due to its appearance but soon found it difficult to install. It adjusts to large and small diameter wheels with inserts and tightens with a limited play screw, thus making it necessary to have it cranked out as far as possible while forcing it into the slot to connect. Even with two people pressing on it, it was impossible to make it tight. I have spinners on my boat and lawn tractors but this one was by far the most difficult to install. If you have a very large diameter wheel, then it might be perfect."
3,A collection of short stories in the Vorkosigan series.,"This is a collection of short-stories in the Miles Vorkosigan space opera series. Each story takes place at a different point in Miles' career. One of these stories, ""The Mountains of Mourning"" (1989), where Miles has to deal with the prejudices of his own planet, won a Nebula Award for best science fiction short story of the year. If I could, I would probably award the book three-and-a-half stars."
5,THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!,"These dvds got me to really stand up straight for the first time in my life! The information, and the exercises, do work exactly as they're supposed to! There is information and techniques that you will not find elsewhere. I recommend that you get this original 2 set dvd, at least initially, if you seriously need help for your posture. Janice shows you, in detail, what to do in order to stand up correctly (and just as important - what not to do). Then she shows you how to do the exercises. These dvds helped not only my posture, but they also helped my self-esteem. By the way, the newer, exercise-only dvd is also fantastic for learning and following along with posture exercises. The newer dvd is great for practicing posture exercises often and quickly. You will notice an improvement in posture, and in increase in energy, immediately with these dvds. They are TRULY LIFE-CHANGING DVDs! Thank you so much to Janet for making these available!"
3,"good information, bad format","[Edit: see comment below. Apparently an updated version has a better format.] The information is good and presented in a succinct, clear way. But it's hard to know what to do with this DVD after you've watched it once or twice. The long explanations are so interspersed with the exercises that when you're trying to just go through the exercises you are forever reaching for the mouse to fast-forward. With all the space on DVDs, why not copy out just the exercises to a separate ""just the exercises"" section? I guess I could be grown up and *learn* the exercises and make a list for myself and just do them on my own. But one of the main points of buying the DVD was the hope that I could improve my posture by just mindlessly clicking ""play"" every day and following along."
3,Not a perfect fit,"I need to add a spacer , I used washer to make this motor mount to work the mount is short by 1/2 inch."
5,Into Great Silence,"Into Great Silence is more an experience than a film. It captures a spirituality that takes your breath away, stills your soul, and leaves you savoring the quiet. The length of the film (2:45) is necessary in order to convey the rythm of monastic life, and it does it successfully."
1,Not appropriate for me,Boots look like they're work boots! Not leather... and that fact not mentioned in description of item.
4,Like the brave and proud galactic pioneers,"Ah, the days of living in Milwaukee when there actually was a music scene! This seemed to be the final push of the original music that came out in the mid nineties. Lots of good stuff on this album. Where have all these folks gone?"
2,Read the previous one.,"This collection was not as exciting nor interesting as the first one of the series.This one is a waste of your time and money. The first one was fresh and held your attention. This second one, the stories dwindle and even drags on, until you just want to toss it out.All of the authors have lovely novels outside of this series, but this collection was horrible in comparison to the first one.Don't try to best an original."
3,Who the hell wrote the Whistledown columns?????,"I can't believe Lady Whistledown really wrote all those mean comments. For heavens sake! I don't think it's in the character's nature (I know who Whistledown is). She actually accused people without knowing all the facts. The only saving grace for this book is that I liked some of the stories. And does Miss Martin really have to keep on giggling? (not laughing, I can understand laughter but giggling throughout the story? No. I positively don't get what's so funny)"
4,Fantastic value - gorgeous timepiece,"This is a beautiful watch for a great value. Gorgeous bracelet, and deep blue faceplate. Crystal is nice and flat, reducing glare.Feedback from chrono buttons nice and solid.Minor qualms;Topring does not rotate.Chronograph only measures down to seconds - not 1/10 or 1/20 sec.Bottom line - makes a great everyday sport watch, and looks great with any dress-type. Value is unbeatable."
3,Too big for small wrists,"I bought this watch as a gift for my fiance. It is stylish, nicely weighted, and elegant. Unfortunatly the face is big enough, and the band inflexible enough, that for small wrists, there is a large gap between the watch and the arm at the junction between the face and band, making it look and feel clunky. Had to return it."
2,interesting but not great,"Nice DVD which focuses on the last years of his life and a little too much on that deranged person who killed him (if that is the truth). I would have preferred to see more of his fashion, designs, how he became what he was. Then you also have to include his death but not dwell on it too long. the interview with the killer's father is lame as he just wants to get money out of it all. Versace was unique and that is what this dvd should have been about. Overall interesting but if you are looking for biography of the stylist's life then this is not the dvd you want"
4,fight the system is an all around great album!!,I must say that squad five-0 has really outdone themselves in this album!! All together style and sound is terrific! If you're a fan of punk rock this album is for you! All of the tracks are very well laid out and all fit together like pepperoni on a pizza! Check it out!!
4,Wanted more......,"Reading the book a person see how small homes were the norm and how they were built and all. I live in a small house built in the late 1800's here in the Mother Lode of California, so I well understand the old small homes. But what isn't often discussed is how poorly laid out they are and even claustrophobic at times. This is why I like the new modern small homes that are built upwards, often on small lots to get the most space for a small space.Yes, the McMansions have loads of wasted space and use way more natural resources. But I would have like to see more examples of homes for 2000 and onward that were slick and clean looking, as well as environmentally friendly.And the price. YIKES. Although to be fare it does come with a CD. So see if your library can get a loaner copy for you to use."
1,Poor excuse for a book,"This book is not even worth reviewing. Lousy, a real waste of paper! Another publisher-author out to get your money."
5,A Fiddlefoot by Another Name,"Saddlebum is the pretence Jerry East uses when he comes to town seeking the murderer of his brother; and with little to go on, he knows it will be a tough go. But when trouble finds him right at the start, he knows he has ridden into the right place, and suspicion falls on him when a cowboy gets ""dry gulched"". Yet, he has the support of the local sheriff, from a Steve Sanborn--shadowy figure with a mysterious past; and from Amy Truesdale; and I reckon you can probably guess the outcome, or can you? This is good old fashioned traditional western story telling at its best. I highly recommend this book."
4,Just fine.,This works fine. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no indicator light on the front.
5,GREAT FOR MUSIC CD'S UNLESS YOUR TRYING TO PLAY WITH OUTDATED DEVICES,"it is the same product in the 10 pack that everyone is giving 5 stars ,so read date of reviews because Amazon ought to remove reviews after 2 years when it's not even the exact same kind. WHAT REALLY MAKES THESE WORTH THE MONEY IS DOING A CD OR DATA DISC AND TRANSFER TO ANOTHER MACHINE THEN ERASE AND USE AGAIN AND AGAIN SEE THE MONEY YOU'LL SAVE OVER THE KIND YOU CAN ONLY BURN ONCE !I'VE CREATED MUSIC CD AND PLAYED BACK IN MY TOSHIBA DVD RECORDER OVER THE TV HOME THEATER SYSTEM AND SHARE OR GIVE AS A GIFT.PLAYED IN CAR CD PLAYERS WITH MP3 MUSIC AND NO PROBLEMS,WRITE TO AMAZON TO REMOVE OUTDATED REVIEWS SO YOU CAN MAKE BETTER BUYING DECISIONS...."
2,Love the style and color,It heats at different temps all the time. It is hard to decide if you need a couple minutes or more for each usage
5,Fun and interesting,I read for knowledge rather than fun. I love learning new things.When I'm not in the mood to read a subject book I turn to bookslike this. While light in nature I still learn interesting littlefacts that I would have otherwise not known. It is an easy readand gives you conversational facts.
2,Yikes,"I thought was going to be entirely different than it was. Using dead nun's brains to do scientific research was not what I was expecting. For me, then, this was extremely disappointing and did not care to read any more. It could be just the thing for someone else, however."
4,WOW,"This was the first Robert Barnard books that I purchased & read,. It was so good, tht over the years we have boght & read every one of his novels.We just started his lates Dying Flames.Mr. Barnard has such a fantastic writing style, you cannot put hia books down. We look forward to every one of his & Simon Brett's noverls as MUST reading material."
1,Ughh....ooooffff!!! ....YUCKITY-YUCK-YUCK!!,"Spleggheeetthhh.!!!!!...Yuck....did I say ""terrible"" already?? Sheez, this book is bad...I just don't know what came over me to even start reading it. What a sham of a plot...I think I read the same thing before in an old issue of TRUE magazine. G-yuckkk!Do yourself a favor...stick some needles in your eyes instead of reading this tripe."
5,'Journal Therapy',"I took this off the shelf to revisit after several years and was surprised that I had forgotten what a gem this book is! The book has a plethora of writing excercises and advice to guide you toward working out and through different situations. This is an excellent self help resource, and it's great for writers, journalers, and for healing.This time around, I started out working from chapter 18 which is on Perspectives, Decisions and Roads Not Taken. When I finished that, I left the book out and have worked on several other excercises.This is a book that I'd never part with because it is so versatile and useful. It would make a great gift item. This gives meaning to the saying ""A book is a present you can open again and again."""
5,100% Stratusfaction Guaranteed!,"This is 100% Stratusfaction Guaranteed! Trish's new music is TIGHT! This CD is perfect! I love all the theme songs, especially Trish's ""Keys to the City"" by Lil Kim! Trish is the best ever and the hottest too!"
2,total rehash!,"be warned! the anthology cd is mostly just a compilation album taken from the previous 5 wwe albums. the wwe could have made this cd special, instead we get mostly all theme's that have been released prior to the cd. there are SO many older theme's not present, such as the brutus "" the barber"" beefcake's and what about booker t's wwe entrance theme??? no wcw theme's are present. this album is not worth the time or effort. hopefully the wwe will release a true anthology cd with the rare theme's and wcw theme's. stay away from this one!"
3,not the best,"In some areas im dissapionted in this album. There are many many songs that are very good but many of them could have been left out for better songs. i wonder why Randy savage, undertaker ( funeral march), metalhead (the game) the raw theme (now) got beat out by Bertha Faye, flash funk, Corpate minisrty and others that dont really belong. the first CD is good but it seems to go downhill from there. but if you enjoy the classic music this is a must buy."
3,"It's just a bunch of wrestling themes, no more",Wrestling themes just aren't what they used to be.and what's up with the bands who put out themes for wrestlers? Do they all plan to sound the same?Limp Theory of a Drowning Saliva Pool Bizkit. They suck.Seek out the original WWF Piledriver album from the late eighties. It sucks too but at least it's funny.
5,WWF/WWE over the years.....good stuff,"this album is great....all different entrance musics from the last 15-20 years of the WWF (I still cant get used to calling it WWE)....its funny to see how much the entrance music has changed.....and also how cheesy the music was back in the 80's....but I still cant help but sing along to the classic ""Real American"" entrance music for Hulk Hogan....alot of good memories for me since I grew up watching the likes of Hogan....Ultimate Warrior...Randy Savage...Ted DiBiase....and to hear all their entrance themes once again....its pretty damn cool....if you are any kind of WWF fan you will enjoy this....more so if you go back into the 80's like I do......definetly worth buying"
3,Great product...but only for a couple years!,"I bought this same blanket but in pink 5 years ago for my last baby. It did everything it promised when I first got it and would have recommended it to everyone. It was wonderful for about 2 years, never let water through even on wet soccer fields. Then slowly notice it would be damp on the top. Just last month took it to the park and it seemed to draw the moisture from the dirt under the dry grass up. We gave up on the blanket and started sitting on a doubled up beach towels instead, which kept us dry! I wrote to Tuffo and was told that the blankets start loosing their water resistance at about 3 years. So if you are interested in a $40 blanket that is good for 3 years or less, then this is the blanket for you. Otherwise, I would recommend looking into another brand. Which is exactly what I am in the process of doing now."
5,Water-Resistant Outdoor Blanket,"This is an excellent purchase! I was given one as a gift and took it to an outdoor concert with my husband and newborn and our friends who have toddlers loved it so much we bought them one for a holiday gift. It is terrific because the grass does not stick to it so you can shake it off and the backside is water resistant for that recently watered grass that everyone hates to put blankets on! Funny thing is, even wet grass does not stick to it that much! I love how I can fold it up into a carrying case and put sunscreen, etc into the side pocket. It also washes perfectly! I will be giving this as a gift for every new family!"
5,Wahoo!,It arrived this afternoon.... really nicely made. The pattern is great and the kids are playing with it in the backyard as I write this. This one will be dual purpose - summer concerts/picnics and kids for backyard fun. Cannot attest to toughness but will try to check back as we wrap the '12 summer.
3,Slippery on Sand,"Overall a well constructed blanket with a nice self-contained carrying sleeve. Its fine for watching an evening concert when the grass gets wet as the night progresses. At the beach maybe not so good. The plastic underside results in 2 problems. The blanket has no ""traction"" so it slides on the sand and blows around on a windy day unless weighted down at all 4 corners. More significantly, when you plop your wet body down on the blanket, the water just stays on the blanket. It does not drain through to the sand below like a cloth blanket. Consequently, the blanket gets pretty wet very quickly and pretty wet (and can feel a little cold) the whole time you are at the beach unless its very hot."
2,Nice Pattern but Cheap Fabric,"I chose this outdoor blanket because of the cute pattern and the price was right. I was debating between this and the JJ cole and I wish I had gone with the JJ cole! The fabric on this one is very cheap and a bit too lightweight...I find I have to weight it down when I use it - in constrast to the JJ cole with is a little more heavy duty. Also, I have a 8 mo old and we do a lot of park playdates with other babies - this fabric stains very easy whereas the JJ cole is wipeable. Lastly, I find the carry case worthless because it is seperate from the blanket, so I often forget to use it or don't like doing the extra step after I fold it; the JJ cole one is sewn into the blanket, so one less step.Just wanted to say that I wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the JJ cole...at least for my purposes."
4,picnic blanket,"The item is very nice, easy to carry, good color - easy to pick out in a crowd. It is very light weight which is good and bad. Good in that it is easy to carry, bad in that the slightest wind blows it so it has to be weighted."
2,Not that impressive,"Can't figure out where all the good reviews are coming from. I've owned this product for about 6 mo and have stopped using it because it stopped doing its job. It worked really well for about 2 weeks, but then the dust cup got dirty (dog hair) and now it no longer traps anything it manages to pick up. If I'm supposed to buy a new $9 filter every couple of weeks, that's unacceptable. Also I find that the cord is very stiff and makes the vacuum frustrating to use and the cord difficult to wrap. On the plus side, it is small enough to vacuum stairs but bigger (and heavier) than a dustbuster. Also, the brush is nice - well, at least it was when when it still worked."
1,Buy something else!,"I luved this unit....in fact bought one for the inlaws to use on their new car....until like most other folks, plugged it in and poof...black stinky smoke and I now have to begin my research for a new one all over again...avoid this unit."
5,BUY THIS HAND-HELD!!!,"I clean carpets and upholstery professionally. This is a great little machine to get pet fur off of fabric because of the beater bar. The stair riser is just a very smart innovation that makes life easier, much easier."
5,Fantastic Vacuum!,"I've been looking for a powerful hand-held vacuum for a very long time. After reading the reviews, I decided to order the Eureka 71B and I am utterly blown away by its effectiveness. Our stairs are covered in cranberry-colored carpeting and we also have a yellow lab. Needless to say, cleaning the stairs has been a challenge. But this vacuum is more than up to the task. It cleans quickly and very, very well. It also did a great job on the car upholstery. This is, hands down, the best product I have ever purchased!"
4,Great vacuum,"I was tired of lugging our shop vac and house vac outside to detail our cars. I bought this handheld because someone said it worked as good as the hand held Dyson. I don't have a Dyson so I cannot compare, but I can tell you this works really well. I have two dogs, both of whom shed and this does wonders on dog hair. Also good for around the bed and the baseboards where it's tough to get the vacuum. Works well in the car as well. Someone complained about the cord not staying wrapped, but mine stays put. The hose works pretty well too. Perfect for the car. If it has one flaw it's that it doesn't have a way to hang it. This is something I'd hang in the garage, but not an option."
1,Good for a short while...then awful!,"This worked pretty well for a little while, but very quickly lost suction (even after cleaning filter)and was useless--just threw it in the trash."
3,Meets expectations,"The vacuum works well. We use it mostly to clean our sofa and stairs. I used it once to clean out my car, but it is a bit heavy and awkward to use in the car. My shop vac works better. The spinning brush does a good job of picking up our Labrador Retriever's hair from the couch. However, a piece of thread from the carpet got stuck in the brush and it was a pain to pick it out. Overall it does a good job, probably better than the other small vacuums we looked at."
3,cumbersome,i bought this thinking it would be a fast alternative for small jobs. it is hard to use and heavy. wants to stall if not held correctly.
4,One Motor,"This vac works as well as described. I found it difficult to believethis unit had two motors as design costly, and larger upright vacs use a simple baffle diversion to change from brush to hose. I emailed Eureka. Their reply: The 71B has ONE motor. My advice: be skeptical ofads and feedback that clone one another. Check the manufacturers description."
5,Awesome!!,"When I first read all the positive comments about this item, I thought no way can it be that good. However, I took a chance and WOW is this little vacuum awesome. I honestly think it has more suction than my upright. Matter of fact, that might be the one and only drawback. It sucks so hard that it makes it dificult to vacuum small rugs because it pulls them off the ground. I have to step on them to do a good cleaning. My last handheld was junk so I was really skeptical about purchasing anothter. Glad I took the chance. I will be using this little guy all the time on my stairs, in my boat, for quick cleanups after the Cat...."
1,1st Time Out of the Box,"The vac didn't even last thru its maiden trial. The motor burned out in a cloud of electrical smoke. Following the instructions I returned it to the local service center where I was told a replacement would arrive in four weeks. When I remarked at the long wait, I was told that the wait was down from three months! As I walked out I saw a stack of the vacs by the door."
5,powerful vacuum,"It is a really good vacuum with a lot of power. Just one thing I would like to suggest -- moving the hose to the center instead of on one side. When I use that to vacuum desk, I have to have one hand hold the vacuum, one hand hold the hose. Then no hand for moving items on the desk."
2,Lasted about a year before burning out,"I had a good run with this vacuum, but just last week as we were vacuuming the floor it started to smell like burnt rubber and suddenly the bottom part where the cord is plugged into started to emit some sparks. I suspect it's the mechanism that turns the brush in the front because it continued to suck in air but the brush didn't turn. We used it on average 15 minutes at time, once a week. I think if it would have lasted 6 more months I would have considered giving it 3 stars."
4,Powerful handheld vacuum,"This little vacuum packs quite the punch, making it easy to suck dirt out of small crevices. It is great for cleaning a car. However, with that great suction the output of air by this unit is equally powerful making it sometimes difficult to avoid scattering dirt before you suck it up."
5,Great vacuum for stairs and small spaces,This is a great vacuum for stairs and small spaces. Easy to handle and has a arm that gets corners and creases.
2,Not as fantastic as I hoped,"Like many other reviewers, I am always in search of the perfect handheld vacuum. I live in an apartment with but a single 8x10 shag carpet in a place full of otherwise wooden floors. I have had the vacuum for approximately 2 years, and it has never really lived up to my (small) expectations. The motor is not really powerful enough to clean the carpet very convincingly, and it is sadly remiss in its bare floor duties. Or perhaps it's not exactly the motor, as I would say that the small extendable hose is fairly reliable, but not a very efficient way to clean. Rather the spinning brush that is the place to pick up dirt seems timid at best, and as such I am always disappointed with its performance. I usually have to sweep after vacuuming.All this and it isn't even cordless! It worked ok on my car (super short pile carpet covers), but not very well and it took quite a bit of elbow grease.I am obviously on the lookout for a new, better option."
4,"Strong suction, but just a little heavy","This vacuum works great on stairs which is what we bought it for. Just like others have mentioned I did find it a tad bit heavy, however I would still purchase it again! I've bought a number of these type gadgets and they didn't nearly have the suction power of this one. Just think of it as working my arms as well as vacuuming the stairs."
5,Unbelievable quality for such a great price,"Unbelievable quality for such a great price. This little handheld works better than our $300+ upright vacuum cleaner, and better than my parent's $70 Dustbuster. Perfect for stairs, and those hard to reach places like under desks, tables and beds. Very strong suction power and easy to remove dust collection cup. Highly, highly recommend this for home or office."
4,nice little vac,"I purchased this vac to keep the area around my two litters clean as well as to remove cat hair from my fabric-covered couches. I used to use the Oreck handheld vac to do this and it is a great vacuum with awesome power, but at $199 dollars it is about 4 times as expensive as this Regina.I think the Regina works well. It's pretty powerful and the rotating bristles do a good job with the cat hair. i wish the hose were a little longer, but I do love the way it secures so nicely to the body of the vac. If it were longer, it probably would always be dangling, so overall, I think it's a good compromise.The only thing I haven't figured out is how to really clean the filter. I'm going to go to the Regina website and see what they recommend.Anyway, I think it's a good vacuum, very solid, at a great price."
5,IT'Z JUST GREAT,"SHIPPING: ***** (It was incredibly Fast)customer service: I really don't know.Item DescriptionSIZE:**** (Just wish a little bit smaller)Noise:** (It is quite loud; I wouldn't use @ night time)Color:*****(It is the exact color what you see on the pic, no color choice)Function:**** (It is Perfect for me to clean my room; oh it gets hot easily)Design: **** (They could make it better, but it is not that ugly neither)Price: **** (Because they change the price)****Recommended"
2,Heavy and short lived,"This machine is overrated. It is heavy for a handheld and incnvenient with the cord, and suction power was never impressive. After less than two years of light use it virtually died. My B&D cordless handheld is not fabulous but it is better. I will not be getting another one of these."
5,"Small, but powerful","If you have an office with limited space and a janitorial staff that provides limited services, this vacuum can be useful for an occasional extra cleaning. It's small, but powerful."
3,adequate,"I don't love this vacuum, but I don't hate it either. I took a chance since the positive reviews far outnumbered the negative ones. I share many of the concerns noted in the less-positive reviews. While it does seem to pick up dirt and hair, I do feel I need to empty the filter half way through vacuuming my stairs. It still picks up pet hair, but it's difficult to know it if is getting the unseen dirt and dust. This vacuum is larger, heavier and more cumbersome that the hand-held stair attachment that is no longer working on my canister vacuum. But, this was less expensive than a replacement attachment. The electric cord is long enough to do a full set of stairs."
2,Was great for 8 uses - that's it,"Worked great and I was thrilled with it, how small and easy to use it was for little vac jobs like the car -- but after about 8 uses - and nothing abusive or making it do what it's not built to -- it began to overheat and so no longer usable! Poor build quality in the motor."
5,It's Strong,"Bought this as a replacement for my old Dirt Devil handheld. The reason why I chose this model is because I was tired of dealing with replacing the vacuum bags for my Dirt Devil(which doesn't work anymore). I prefer these cup varieties where you just open up the plastic compartment and dump the dirt out.The plastic on this model feels sturdy. The thin vacuum head on the hose allows me to get the nooks and crannies. The suction action is pretty strong. Just got done vacuuming the car and various parts of the house, I am pleased with the results. Dumping out the dirt was a snap. Nice product. Highly recommended."
2,Awkward to use,I found this very awkward to use. If you don't hold it just right the side fan throws the dirt around while using the hose attachment. The brush inhibits the vacuum from picking up the dirt on tile floors. I used it one time and haven't picked up again.
4,Great for the price,"I bought this when I moved to a 3-story house and my Dyson was too heavy and awkward to use to clean the stair's carpet. This little thing is powerful and does the job right. I like the riser visor to clean the vertical carpet on the stairs.The only thing I don't like is cleaning the filter - I'm used to the Dyson - but I guess an old toothbrush would probably help.If you have a good vacuum cleaner and are looking for a cheap but decent handheld for your stairs, this is the one."
3,Not Cordless,Hello everyone. I didn't realize it wasn't cordless. It's kind of a hassle since I have to sit on the ground to use it. But it does work.
5,Excellent!,"Received mine yesterday and I am very impressed. It is powerful (two motors allowing you to turn off the agitator bar). Looks great, built well. Used it last nite on our 1 1/2 year old Ashley Furniture sofas and it picked up quite a bit. That surprised me. I ordered more dust cups directly from Eureka, turns out price is about the same as ordering from Amazon, even with S/H. This really is a good product, assuming it will last many years. Get one. I have my car seats to do next."
5,Great Hand-Held Vacuum,"This is the best hand-held vacuum I've ever owned. I would buy it again without hesitation. Unless you must have a cordless vac, I recommend this little Eureka. The cord is extra long, the crevice tool is very handy, the dirt cup is a cinch to empty, it's easy to maneuver, the suction is strong, and it's cute!"
4,Perfect for stairs!,"I bought this because I needed an easy way to vacuum our stairs and other reviewers said it was good. They were right! It's the exact width of a stair so it just takes two passes per stair to clean and the cord is long enough to plug in at the bottle and make it all the way to the top. My only critique would be that I wish the hose attachment were longer. Other than that, it was a good purchase."
2,"Loved it at first, now it doesnt suck!","I really liked this at first, it picked up everything. Now, it doesn't pick up hardly anything, and I don't even have much suction. I've cleaned it, and done everything I can think of to make it work like it once did.....but nothing has worked so far."
4,Powerful hand vac,Got the eureka hand-held because it is driven by a powerful motor and it didn't disappoint. The very first run grabs so much dust that it clearly tells you that you have a good product. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star is that the roller catches a lot of hair and I haven't been able to remove the roller easily. This means some amount of effort to get the tangled hair out from the roller. Apart from that I'm happy with the product.
5,awesome hand vac...perfect for stairs!,If you want a lightweight vacuum for your stairs...you're search is over! It is light weight and cleans stairs perfectly without lugging a heavy upright vacuum around. It's powerful and works like a champ! Highly recommend!
4,Almost Perfect,"believe the reviews: this is a good handheld vac. my two complaints are: the weight and bulky handle. eureka, please make the next model with a slimmer handle with rubber grip."
4,Great value,"Fairly strong power and flexibility of attachments make this a useful hand-held for car and furniture upholstery, stairs, and other hard-to-reach areas. No need for bags. The only thing I would've wanted was a wall mount. All in all, a complete system."
4,Great Job,"This littl vac is perfect for carpeted steps. It does the job quickly, isn't too heavy and easily stored."
5,Great handheld vacuum,"Unlike the Dirt Devil I previously had, this is far more powerful, quiet and user friendly. I have a house with a lot of carpeted stairs and this is very convenient and effective. Also works well on rug in car. I would recommend this product."
3,It's better than hauling the vacume on the stairs.,The other reviews were glowing - I really expected an exceptional product. It works alright but not as fantastically as others have said.
3,Small and efficient but not complete.,Does a great job but I did not get a crevice attachment and that is what I needed most. I would like the crevice attachment.
5,this is the one!,this is a super excellent hand vac. I have had a few over the years and have never been so pleased!! It is powerful and easy to use. the hose and attachment are convenient and fantastic.
4,Eureka 71A Hand-Held Vacuum,This vacuum is a back saver for cleaning carpeted stairs! It would be perfect for carpeted walls in a boat. It is easy to clean.
4,Great for cleaning the Stairs,This one is light enough to take it anywhere to do the job. It is especially effective when cleaning the stairs.
2,Too small,"The machine is too small and I'm unsure if the ""no bag"" feature is good. You can hardly judge it size by picture and it becomes a problem when you get it."
3,awkward to hold,"Okay, maybe it's unrealistic on my part, but I took the Amazon country of origin ""made the US"" as fact. No, dear reader, it's made in China.But more important, it's heavy and awkward to use. I bought it because I'm constantly cleaning up cat litter and I thought a dust buster would help. The Eurekda is very powerful and ample for the job but if you look closely at the photos, the person is always on bended knees for good reason. Using this hand-held vac will give you a back ache in no time flat. And it's fairly heavy. In conclusion, if I knew what I know now, I would have bought another vac.Pros: long chord, powerful, good suction, easy to remove and replace dirt bagCons: very awkward to use unless you're on your knees. The wrap-around hose should be longer, heavier than many of its competitors"
2,angry at my Eureka vacuum,"I wrote a raving review of this vacuum a week or so after I got it. I have to change my tune, now. The filter got REALLY gross, really quick. It was very difficult to get the microscopic type dirt out of the filter. I bought a replacement filter. For some reason, it lost about 80% of it's sucking power even with the new filter. Today I was trying to vacuum and it died. It just died. It worked great the first couple weeks, then went kablooey. If it had even lasted 6 months at the capacity it had at the beginning, I would consider it well worth the cost. But it started petering out after a few weeks! Lame!"
4,Almost perfect,I was very impressed with shipping; the product arrived within a few days after I placed an order. This cleaner gets the job done. It's actually not as heavy as others have made it out to be (I don't consider myself particularly strong). I would appreciate it more if more time was allowed for usage before the machine shuts off to cool down its motor but since I have a small space to work with it's not a huge deal. Probably not recommended for those who need heavy duty cleaning within a large space. Overall it's a nice gadget for a small room like the one I own.
5,Excellent product.,Came on time. Has exceptional level of suction. Works great for vacuuming carpet on stairs. I would recommend to anyone needing a small handheld for household chores.
1,Didn't last very long...,"Very powerful little handheld, great for stairs and hard to reach spots. Clearly would be a 5 star itemEXCEPT...We only used the thing every few months on our stairs and a couple other tight spots. Couldn't have had more than an hour or two of run time on the machine. The first time we used it after the end of the one year warranty, the motor let out all it's black smoke. It even left a stain on the carpet. I really expect products to last a bit longer than their warranty."
1,Broke after the first week.,We got this vacuum for the office and within the first week the vacuum broke. We were using it to vacuum some dirt from the potted plants and somehow the dirt got stuck in the switch release and wouldn't release the cup. I don't recommend using it to pick up dirt/soil.
4,I have four cats and this thing is AMAZING!!,"GREAT vacuum for in-between clean-ups. I use this weekly to get four cats' worth of hair off of my couch and chairs. Works great and picks up all the junk really well! I gave it the ""lint roller test,"" meaning that I vacuumed the couch and then used the lint roller to see what was missed. Amazingly, not much cat hair was left behind! The ability to swivel the brush cover for vertical cleaning is super useful!Minus 1 star for being a little on the heavy side, not having an additional handle in the back for extra carrying support when cleaning, and for making it too easy to accidentally open the dust catcher when turning the vacuum off. This last thing hasn't happened to me yet, but I can see how it could. All not big issues by any means.This thing is a definite EXCELLENT buy for pet owners!"
4,Does a good job..,"This is my first hand held, mainly bought it to clean my car. It is nice, I landed up using it for the stairs too, it is convenient as it is small. I would say that it is not very comfortable to hold so I take off a star for that. Overall a good one."
5,Eureka!! An answer to my problem.......,"Four cats = hair everywhere!I have tried everything known to man that might effectively clean, collect, remove the hair and nothing yet has been truly successful.Until now!I've cleaned a cat bed and had to empty the vac - that's how much hair that my upright vacuum attachments couldn't pick up. I've cleaned the couch and it's spotless. I've cleaned the quilt in our bedroom. I've cleaned certain areas of the carpet.I have no complaints about ""loud."" I own a Eureka Boss upright vac that is louder than most vacs so it seems loud may just be a common feature of Eureka products.I'm in my 70s and had a bit of concern about the weight but so far, no problem even when vaccing a vertical surface such as the couch back.Everything about this little gem is easy, easy, easy!"
5,Small but Mighty,This little vacuum picks up things my Bissel Pet vacuum leaves behind!! The moveable brush guard makes cleaning the stairs a million times easier than a standard vacuum!! I would purchase this vacuum again if I ever need to!!!
4,"Heavy, but worth the workout","It's defintely not a Dustbuster, but that's a good thing, because this puppy really works. The brushes pick up a lot of pet hair. We got it mainly for cleaning the stairs. It's heavy, but a lot lighter than lugging our ShopVac up and down the stairs. It requires frequent emptying, but that's because it's actually working. I'd give it 5 stars if it were a little lighter.Before this we had a Dirt Devil, which was completely worthless. It was the loudest vacuum I've ever heard, and it had almost no suction. Then, after that we had a little Craftsman vacuum that came as a freebie with our Craftsman ShopVac. That thing had absolutely no suction, but at least it wasn't as loud as the deafening Dirt Devil.This Eureka is not quiet, but it's fairly typical of a vacuum--as far as noise goes. Most of all, it works! I also love the little wand. It's easy to switch to that and you don't have a bunch of hose to wrestle with or store."
4,it sucks well but fills up fast,It works very well as many others mentioned. But it fills up fast and needs to be dumped frequently. Also the filter needs to be taped out or washed at the same time since it clogs a bit.It is still very good and I would happly buy it again.
5,This little hand held rocks!,"I've had several hand helds including Dirt Devil,Sharks and several cordless ones and this vaccum is the best one I've ever used! Wow does it have some power! We have two cats and their hair gets everywhere they lay. My floor model Kirby, with it's attachments on, doesn't pick up the hair half as fast as this does! I also LOVE it's long cord. We just got rid of our Shark that had a retractable cord, but it was so short I sometimes couldn't reach the whole couch from the outlet. I agree with other reviewers that this vacuum is indeed a bit heavy, but that must be what makes it so strong too! I think it would be too heavy for someone who is elderly or has some weakness of the wrists, but otherwise it is fine...it's not like you are vacuuming the floor of a whole room with it! I rarely post reviews, but felt I should because I love this so much. I've already recommended it to other friends with cats/dogs. Makes your life quicker and easier and we could all use that!"
4,Good little vacuum,"This vacuum works well for the purpose that we intended; the stairs. It has a tremendous amount of suction for such a small vacuum and is easy to use. It would recommend this vacuum to people with the need for a small powerful vacuum. We haven't tried it yet on the cars, but it should work great."
2,Good while it lasted,"I bought this vaccume in October 2011 and was very impressed with it. I have mosty hardwoods, but used the vaccume once a month or so to clean the stairs and the small area rugs in the house. After roughly 11 uses, the vaccume has turned into a noisey paperweight, there is no more suction and the brushes have stopped rotating. After cleaning the unit and having nothing improve, I tossed it and will not be buying a replacement. Even at this price is should last more than 11 uses."
2,Vacuums so good sparks fly...well sort of,"After reading the glowing reviews on here, I purchased this vacuum to use on the steps in my home. Plugged it in, and I will say for the first 10 steps it did a TREMENDOUS job...was cleaning like crazy. Then, all of a sudden my vacuum lit up like a Christmas tree, a small ball of fire came out the back, a big puff of smoke and then as the sound of the motor got weaker and weaker, sparks began to fly out the back. I realize with all the good reviews, I must have gotten a lemon...but I will say this was one of the best fireworks displays I have ever seen...which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1!"
4,Thank God for Cords!,"I went out to buy a electric hand vac only to find all cordless, I was very disappointed and then looked on Amazon only to find just what I wanted, it works great and I don't have to pay a fortune to replace chargers. Vac is always charged when I need it! I would recommend this product to all my friends! You will find that the suction is great and very easy to use inside and out. The cord is plenty long enough for all jobs. Wish it came with a converter for car."
3,Poor suction,I rent a room so I needed a small vac to clean carpets. I purchased this one based on good reviews but I'm disappointed with it's poor suction. It would not pick stuff a size of an apple seed or a small bead off the carpet.
5,Awesome little vac!,"Used it right out of the box on a couple sets of stairs in our house. WOW!!! We have cats and this thing is the pet hair getter' extraordinaire!! Our upright is also a Eureka and it does a great job so I felt good about buying this brand. This handheld is great for smaller jobs/stairs/furniture/car. Great power and a clear collection bin so you can see it working! The ""Riser Visor"" feature is FABULOUS! Stairs are already hard to vacuume, let alone the riser and this handheld vac gets it done! It does get a little heavy with continued use, but I just count it as exercise and arm toning! Love, love, love it!!! Thanks Eureka for a great product!!!!!"
2,GREAT VACUUM.....FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS,"I purchased this vacuum about two years ago for the purpose of vacuuming my stairs and my chenile couches. I have two cats (one a Himalayan). This vacuum WAS amazing for the first 2 years. Suddenly I smelled something burning, not like rubber burning, more like electrical. Then I saw sparks inside like near where the cord goes into the vacuum. I cleaned the brushes all the time but it still sparked up. I am so disappointed because it worked so well."
3,Blows dirt behind it - Does not appear to have on/off switch,I purchased this to clean up cat litter daily and to clean our car interiors. It is much sturdier and heavier then I expected and it works much better than a dustbuster. I may be missing the on/off switch but I've been unplugging mine to turn it off. On our tile and wood laminate flooring it has a tendency to blow cat litter/ dirt/ dust behind it rather than suck it up.
2,There is no crevice tool!,"Just received this product today. When I opened the box and read the instruction, I found that the crevice tool is missing! Without that crevice tool this thing is like 40% crippled!"
5,Best handheld vaccume,Product works great! It is very powerful and has a long cord which can come in handy when cleanin gthe stairs or the car in the garage. I can not think of anything to change about this vacuum
5,Good,"It works very well, great power!!! power cord very long, that's good.Noisy ? Yes but..... Turn the music ON!!!! at least you are cleaning!!!--------------------SP-------------Trabaja muy bien, gran potencia!! Cable de de poder muy largo lo cual es bueno.Ruidosa? Si pero...súbele a la música al fin y al cabo estas haciendo la limpieza!!"
5,Great for cat hair!,Great for getting cat hair off furniture and just having a whip round to pick up the hair. Maybe a little heavy but so powerful it's worth it and a great price.
2,personally I wouldn't recommend this product,it wasn't what I was looking for. it's very heavy to use and needs to be plugged in. nothing special about this product.
4,This Is 1 Powerful Little Vac.,"This thing is Super-Powerful!It is Made For A Leftie which i am not,to bad you Can't Use Both Sides.Like the Unraveling of The Cord easy.To Clean this Filter you Need Another Vac to Swoop Away The Crap Left On The Filter if you want it clean which i do.A Good Buy For $35.00 and i especially like the Yellow/Black Color,Eyecatching like a Big Bee or Wasp.I Like the Ease of the Snap Cover That Holds The Filter.This has 2 Speed Forward,Including Auto-Roller,and Reverse for Filter and Container Release i would recommend this vacuum."
3,Manufacturer defect,"I just used this vac for aroun 4 minuts and shut off and never turned on again, I took it to the store they recomended me to and still waiting for a new one, becose they said that they can not fix it... So, I'm here, waiting."
4,Great little vacuum,"We needed a hand held vacuum but I have not had very good experiences with these, from an old DustBuster we had to a Dirtdevil that this replaced. I was pleasantly surprised by this model. No bag that comes flying off, and I've had this for a few years now and there's been no loss in power. Easy to empty dust container and I've never had one of these with an attached hose, which is a great feature. I use it mostly on stairs and cleaning the car."
4,Eureka Hand Held Vacuum does the job,I purchased this hand held vacuum after my old original Dirt Devil bit the dust (literally)...the part that kept the dirt from flying back out at you fell off! I researched through customer reviews for awhile before deciding on this product. It performs well on carpeted stairs and hard surfaces as well. I also use it to vacuum out the car with the convenient hose attachment. The fact that the front position rotates to do the vertical part of the stairs is a real plus! The weight is good and it is easy to clean out the dirt compartment. My only complaint is that it is difficult and frustrating to wind up the cord in the given amount of space on the vacuum.
4,Awesome Suction,"This vacuum really, well, sucks! It is like having a 12 Amp unit in your hand.The only downsides I see are the hose is short and there is no brush attachment. I think one can be ordered from Eureka though.Still, I think this is the best hand-held on the market considering it's price."
4,great sucker!,"this vacuum cleaner really cleans. however, it is true that it is not exactly handy in the sense that you might expect a hand held vacuum cleaner 1) to have a cordless option 2) to be lightweight and 3) easy to maneuver (it fails in these 3 areas). This is why i give it 4 instead of 5 stars. i wouldn't recommend this for a car -- it is possible, but you will need an attachment with a longer hose, as the hose on this is way too short. Please note that this vacuum cleaner is pretty heavy for a hand held and you'll work up a sweat. However, if you just want use it at your office desk or for your couch or under the bed for places harder to reach than a large household vac like I do, then you've found your best friend."
1,This book's price guide needs to be changed completely!,"I feel that the price guide was very badly placed, it is in the back of the book. The listings of the cars were in alphabetical order to some extent. I prefer the prices to be right under their corresponding cars."
1,"like the sinatra duets, something isn't right","this just isn't that good. honor this great musician by getting works only by ray. he doesn't need other people to make his songs great.it's sad the grammys got it wrong by going overboard on a lesser album, instead of honoring the genius of simply ray back in the day, when he was alive to receive the accolades."
4,Loving the Legacy,"this album is a classic. the songs are moving and you can feel the soul in ray's voice. i love the fact that each song has a guest apperance from a notable artist. with respect to ray charles i believe that this is one of his better albums. my favorite songs are number seven with willie nelson and number six with bonnie raitt. this is def. a collectors piece for all ray charles fans, young and old."
4,Almost Perfect,"This is not a classic Ray Charles record, but it is not meant to be. What it does have are several classic duets of classic tunes however. Most notable is the work with Norah Jones, Bonnie Raitt and Diana Krall. Not groundbreaking but very enjoyable."
2,Lacking Soul,"I was really disappointed with this album. Overproduction caused the soul to bleed from each and every track, leaving the listener with something inoffensive and bland. It's as if the musicians were given some Xanax and a script to read from. I'm going back to the old Ray Charles albums."
3,"Fell in Love Again with Ray Charles's Music Watching ""Ray""","I loved the movie Ray and remembered all the great songs he wrote and sung in the movie. Went out to buy this CD for a music buff and myself. Felt it was a good CD to have because its Ray's last. But, must admit I've liked some of his other CD much better. My absolute favorite on this CD is the song with BB King. Once I heard them singing, the CD got ""kicked up"" a notch."
2,Ray was past his prime,"Well recorded, but Ray was quite a bit past his prime and his voice is almost painful to listen to."
2,awful,I would enjoy this album more if the choruses had more depth to it. I couldnt bare listening to the whole album. I cut it off mid way through. But I think I liked two tracks. So two stars for that.
1,Elizabeth Gaskell,"I see I'm the first person to review this book, and I can understand why. No one else has read it. That's because it's almost unreadable. The type is very small. The author cannot have omitted a single scrap of his copious research. His selection skills need honing. People with only remote connections to EG, and many with no connection at all, are discussed in tedious detail.This book is definitely not for the common reader. The details may interest other scholars, and the author is probably justifiably proud of all the new facts he's unearthed, but these do not make for compelling, or even interesting, reading by ordinary fans of literary biographies."
5,Best Cd,This cd has to be one of my favorite hardcore cds. This cd has some really good breakdowns and I prefer this voice than the new one. Im kinda dissapointed in the band now but they're still good. I think if you like hardcore you must buy this cd. It's there best one yet.
2,Boring and odd,"This book has been hailed as a comic masterpiece of irony, etc. I wish that I had enjoyed it as such, but I found it obscure, utterly lacking in writing style, and full of inexplicably abrupt plot changes.The plot revolves around a pretty boy, apparently orphaned, who is discovered on a park bench and introduced to a series of bizarre people. They all want to own him in some way, which simply doesn't make sense as there is nothing interesting about him whatsoever. He just blunders on, into greater and more improbable situations, none of which I found funny in the slightest. It is like reading a novel by Eugene Ionescu, without the humor and surrealism.In other words, I just didn't get it and don't think it is worth the effort. I would never have gotten through it except for the fact that I grabbed it for a long flight and had nothing else to read.Not recommended."
5,Perspectives from a Mediator and Trainer,"This book is a ""must read"" for those who want to stay working with the organization they are with but who are frustrated by inter-personal confrontations at work. In a gentle, often humorous manner, it provides explanations for what is happening, and why. Readers are encouraged to be introspective about their own triggers. Each chapter concludes with proven practical tips to use, such as ""listen first"" or ""pause before you speak"".My suggestion - read it, at your leisure. Whether you are a frustrated manager, a disgruntled employee, a parent looking for a different way of communicating with your teen or your spouse, an individual involved in a specific conflict, a mediator or a dispute resolution trainer, you will acquire at least one new insight that will make your life better.Deborah Lynn Zutter, June 10, 2005"
3,The basics are here but navigating the tables is strenuous.,"The chapters are well written,although most could have been a little more comprehensive. I was doing fine until I got to the Appendix. It's easy to get lost here. The tables themselves are comprehensive, but not easy to navigate if you don't know your family names, or if you don't know the name of the item (i.e.plant/bird etc.) you're looking for. No index at all. At least it does have a glossary but for the life of me, why do all the authors assume that everyone knows how to pronounce some of the not so ordinary."
5,A must have router,This router is a must for the workshop. It is easy to use and setup. The power is excellent and it is easy to control. The speed adjustment is outstanding. For the money you cannot go wrong. Good Job Porter Cable.
1,Disappointed!,"I felt like I was reading a textbook rather than a heart-warming kitty story. It was boring and I had to skip those parts where Jordan analyzed and spoke as a ""biologist"" which sounded sarcastic to me. I couldn't stand Jordan's arrogance, which in fact explained how ignorant he was about cats and about being a cat owner. I was particularly frustrated and disgusted when he kept putting Darwin outside at night despite his cry, when his neighbor threw a shoe at Darwin (really, it's not funny at all), and when he kept spraying water at Hoover (he felt terribly afterwards but it was too late.) I guess the point of this book is to show how Jordan changed because of Darwin. I do get the point. However, his mistreatment of cats, stubbornness, stinginess, and scientific way of thinking were awfully irritating."
4,pretty but petite,"I love the looks of the smoky vessel, but its size is very petite. The thickness of the glass is fine, but the dimension of the bowl is limiting for bigger hands."
4,Very pleased so far,"We received the order very promptly, it was packed well, and was in perfect condition when it arrived. We have not installed it yet, but we are very pleased with the quality of the product so far - it is very heavy and beautiful to look at. Will update this review after bathroom is finished and we have the opportunity to use it."
5,Deeply personal story offers hope,"This is perhaps the most important of Patricia Polacco's autobiographical books. What an overwhelming triumph for a bright and gifted child who was unable to read until late elementary school to have created this book! Polacco shares her feelings of ostracism and self-doubt so poignantly though the written word as well as through her sensitive illustrations. Mr. Falker is the kind of teacher all of us wish we could have had, and for those of us in education, aspire to become. His insight, patience and skill are truly inspiring, as is Patricia's courage in sharing this important story."
5,Another great book from Patricia Pollaco,In this book I think that the little girl is very smart on the inside but she thinks she is dumb on the outside and can't read. But as she reads all the letters wiggle when she reads them. Mr.Falker helps Tricia with her reading skills and tries to make her a better reader. If you would like to find out about the rest of the book look in a library near you.
5,Thank You Mr. Falker,"nbhhhhjTrisha is a girl who can't read. The only thing she likes at school is drawing. In first grade Trisha was trying to say the words from the book but she coult'nt.Trisha somehow passed first and second grade, third and fourth. In 5th grade some boy's made fun of her Mr.Falker told them to stop but one boy did'nt stop.I think that the kid sould'nt made fun of Trisha because what if that was you how would you feel? I recommed it to everyone because it makes you wonder how I Was making others feel.I thought what if some kids were making fun of me or you."
5,FANTASTICO!!!,"I believe this is the absolute best work Gloria Estefan has ever done. If I could only have one of her records, this would be my choice!"
5,Simplest Solution,"The X-Mat is simple, easy to use and cost effective. My dogs stay away from my new leather love seat because the X-Mat works. There is nothing electrical or complicated about the product. There is nothing to break down (electrical) so no need to think about it. You just place it on the cushions, spiny side up and you are done. I would highly recommend it. I suggest you scatter a number of clothes hangers on your cushions until the product arrives. The hangers also work to keep the dogs off the cushions but are a pain in the neck to do this all the time. Therefore, the X-Mat is the best solution."
4,Great Idea,"This is awesome. I have my pet potty pad in the garage for rainy days and my dog would go out and chew the wires. I tried everything from the bitter spray to the upside down plastic protection runners and ""they didn't work. Got these and have no problem!"
2,My cat just steps in the holes!,"I do not have space in my kitchen to cover every inch with these mats, especially since the mat comes in only 1 size--large square. So my 7-month-old kitten just jumps next to the mat and then steps in the holes to get where he is going. I do not know if I will buy more of these."
2,not like it use to be.,"Turtle wax, 40/50 years ago was great. It would compound scratches out and remove stains fromcar paint. I bought it, shipped it over to Vietnam and it would not take gas stains off of my motorcycle.Live and learn.No, I would not recommend this product.jbay"
1,A PSP FLOP,"The votes are in and this is how Transformers on the PSP has scored:Gamespot Rating: 4.0 out of 10 (Bad)- None of the other versions are exactly good, but at least they aren't as tediously boring as the PSP game.CNET Rating: 4.0 out of 10 (Mediocre)- Giant robots blowing stuff up should and almost always is awesome. In Transformers (for PSP), it's anything but.1Up Rating: C-- Visually the game is hurting. The drab, empty locales are just the tip of the iceberg: The animation of these giant robots is just ugly. And the transformation animations in particular are hilarious...they literally have no transformation animations whatsoever.IGN Rating: 5.5 (Mediocre)- terrible graphics, horrible control, dull combat."
3,Little Bears,"The book was an interesting read for me, as I also flew with A Company (Little Bears) in 1969-1970. The names that he mentioned of people in the unit I remember, but I think that some of the details and timing of events may be just a bit off... unless my memory is not what it used to be. Anyway it does make a good read about an obscure aviation unit during some very trying times."
4,So cute,"My friend has a little girl (3 years old) who is just adorable. Well they have a small white poodle who her little girl just LOVES. So I knew this would be an awesome Christmas gift to give her. She loved it and continued to beg her mother to dye their poodle pink! She carries it around a lot and loves how it feels. It is SMALL, at least from what I was expecting but it did what was needed :)"
1,If what I have read is true,"I cannot believe that somebody would write these things for pregnant women to read. Why on earth would you want to persuade pregnant women that you can basically do whatever you want with your body while you are pregnant and take no extra percautions? It is risking the life of the baby and your health, just to up sales costs a little because it is what you WANT to read, not what you need to read. I would recommend ""What to Expect When You Are Expecting"". That book explains what is good for you and what is not good for you and why, which is why some of the readers here seem to enjoy this book. Save yourself and your kid by not buying this book."
2,Not for me,"I found this book to be too far on the extreme side. This book basically says all goes when preggo. I can't beleive this one book over all the other information out there. I guess after reading it is alright to take ibprofin and smoke pot while preggo, I said enough is enough! If you want someone to tell you everything is o.k, no matter what you do, then is is the book for you. If you want to listen to all the other books and information you have ever hear, don't get this book."
4,A great pregnancy companion,"I really appreciated the information provided by this book. It definitely makes the scary things of pregnancy, and all the ""rules"" about what you should and shouldn't do, seem much more in perspective. I really appreciate the author's tone as well. He is informed and scholarly but the book is written fairly casually as well. After reading, my husband and I felt much more confident going forward into our pregnancy and labor."
5,Rubber Stamped Jewelry by Sharilyn Miller,"Anyone involved with creating jewelry will do well to buy this book. Sharilyn has compiled a project gallery with 20 inspiring art jewelry techniques for the novice or the advanced jewelry artist, with complete directions, clear and concise photos, and basic jewelry-making materials. The techniques and tips on rubber stamping, polymer clay embellishments, fiber art embellishments, shrink plastic embellishments and other creative embellishments are about the best you can possibly get. Included are a gallery of innovative Art Jewelry by other notable Jewelry artists in this field. A gem of a book!"
3,Good solid existentialist ruminant,Perfect reading for those depressive moments in every narcissist's life. Also a must for unrecognized prophets and assorted genius types.
3,Beware Books By Britons,"My title sums it up: While this is not a long book, it feels almost interminable; like eating a healthful meal which has the taste and consistancy of sand. This impression may be caused by the fact that it was written in a different era, or in a genre (the personal essay) in which the twists and turns of the author's thought become as important as his conclusions. I personally find this tedious.Wilson's book is a good introduction to a large number of authors and their postitions; but it is uninspiringly written, and he is left with conclusions that are unhelpful for daily life."
5,Excellent aircraft history,"A ""must read"" for anyone who appreciates the F-8 (or wants to) or just loves military aviation. A thorough history of this amazing airplane and those who flew it through a collection of great first-hand fighter pilot's stories. Some are told from the author's own experience and many more from other Crusader pilots interviewed by the author. For example: John Glenn's record-breaking flight in his own words, along with many accounts of Vietnam MiG encounters. I loved this book and plan on reading much more by this author."
4,Not a reference book for the modeller!,"While I would agree that this book turned out to be an engaging read, it was far from what I expected. As an aircraft modeller, I was looking for a book along the lines of Don Logan's excellent books, also published by Schiffer, which are filled with color photographs of aircraft from many different units as well as excellent information on technical data, such as weapon loadouts. Not so with this book. Yes, there are color and B/W photographs, but there are many portions of the book where it is nothing but page upon page of text.In summary, a great history book, but not a good reference for the modeller."
2,Fez Review,"As an avid reader of travel lit, I looked forward to passing a plane flight ""by traveling to Turkey w/ Mr. Seal."" Whatta an impossible read! Maybe it is the translation, if there was a translation? Sentences are so run-on, sometimes longer than six lines -- and they often weave between past and present. It's hard for the reader to hold the original thread of what Sales is trying to say. I stopped mid-way through, disappointed."
2,Warrior Pistachio,"In this book Mr. Seal carries on the time-honored tradition of British travel writing by depicting the natives as primitive but hospitable and sometimes friendly monkeys. We read on the back cover of the book that Mr. Seal is fluent in Turkish. This is surprising, given his translation of the name of the city of Gaziantep as ""Warrior Pistachio"" (see the map on the first few pages). I guess his confusion, if there is any, arises from the type of pistachio sold in markets as ""Pistachio from Antep"". Also, the name of the city of Menemen is translated as ""Omelet"", but this is as if one translates the name of the city of Vienna as ""Schnitzel"". I would be interested in reading Mr. Seal's deep analysis of origin of names of perhaps, Liverpool and Arsenal. All I can say is, Mr. Seal, please first grow up and then write another travel book."
4,Funny and interesting leisure read,"This book describes the author's jorney mainly through Eastern Turkey and is a successful and funny travel account. The interlaced pieces on the modern Turkish history make the reading not only interesting and entertaining but also informative. Looking at several fuming comments it appears that some folks have an ultimate opinion on Turkish history and reality and consider the author's narrative and comments being partial and distorted. Irrespective the truth, this book is a literarily very good expressed observation and opinion to which the author and the readers have their good right."
2,Brits are funnier when they are making fun of other Brits,"(...). This is just another book that is quick to offer scathing and exagerated reprobation veiled in cheap British humor by highlighting individuals' quirks. It is also outdated -- a better choice, watch ""Keeping up Appearances"" on PBS. Brits are much more tolerable when they are making fun of themselves."
2,Fascinating story but poorly written,"Nancy Wake was undoubtedly a very brave woman as the title suggests, and indeed her life is fascinating. As they say, truth is stranger than fiction, and this is a very good story.However it is a very poorly written story, and the stilted manner of the writing detracts from the story. It is almost childish in its style.Do yourself and Nancy a favour - try another book to learn of her amazing life."
4,look great but hard to clean,They look great but hard to wash. The glue comes off in hot water! had to reattach base and stem on all of 6 that we ordered. They are not as sparkly but they still look nice and cheaper then ~ $300 for the Sw ones (=
5,great quality and value!!,"I originally purchased this to take with me to a Taylor Swift concert and have worn it countless times. I would buy this hat again and again! Usually I get concerts more often in the summer so the Drifter's Tea Stained Round-up Style hat is perfect for keeping the sun off your head or out of your eyes! I also find myself bringing it along to the pool to stay cool since it lets breezes through, but keep my eyes from getting too tired whilst I read in the sunshine."
4,Happy Customer,"I was told multiple times that this product would be great for my skin. I was hesitant to try it but gave it a shot because I have a wedding coming up. Well, I have been using it for about 3 weeks and have noticed my skin clearing. It's a slow process and you have to avoid touching or ""picking"" at your face if you want to see results. The cleanser is really nice and gentle, it doesn't strip your skin or leave it dry.I would suggest giving it a try. I use it with the RareMinerals nighttime powder treatment and see big results."
5,"Solid, precise",Pressure gauge is as described and a solid unit. This will be in my coaching bag - forever?Like the precision and the air-bleed button let's you set ball pressure the way you like. Very nice quality and I like that it comes with two needles.
5,Love that platform!,"I love the color of this shoe, blue, It is also very cumfy and looks great with a skirt or shorts.Buy them now you will not be sorry."
5,New Testament Recovery Version-excellent!,This is the best version I've read so far. The notes are to be prized! They are spiritual meat to my spirit & very enriching. I find more enjoyment of the riches of Jesus Christ thru this version & the notes!
2,Unsure if I go for the footnotes,"Footnotes are more like translators commentaries, and may be danger of misinterpreting the real meaning of the original Greek translations and may end up misleading if you are not equip with the full counsel of the Word."
1,Smelly,"This item smelled too much, so we sent it back. The food also didn't have a nice smell to it after baking."
3,One of a better book,"This is one of a better intro textbook for people interested in Bioprocess Engineering. It covers a lot of engineering fundamentals such as Fluid Mechanics, Heat Transfer, etc. However, it is lack of biology concept (which is needed to give better presentation of the materials). Problems given at the end of chapter will be more useful when accompanied with numerical answers."
4,"Fine Writing, but Thin Plot","Griffith relies alomost entirely on the absurdity of his premises and his adept wordplays to drive his narration, but there is very little plot. You'll enjoy it if you're someone who loves playing with the English language and finding new meaning in the words, but this will still be a read-a-chapter-before-bed book."
5,This one's a keeper.,"Even though my retirement is a few years in the future, the thought of how can I ever afford to retire is with me every day.I read this book straight through.Terry Savage, thank you. Your insight will get me through this and I will refer to your books again and again, long into my retirement years."
5,Porter Cable PIN100,"This is one well built nailer, the double trigger is a good safty feature, it takes a little getting use to but I like it. Push this gun as hard as you want and it fires jam free. Good balance and grip. Beware when working with soft wood like pine, if you press the tip of the gun on the surface of the work piece to hard it will leave a dimple in the wood. This gun is great for trim and will sink the pins below the surface even in oak, and leaves a pin size hole thats very small."
1,Disapointed,"Major disappointment. First it wouldn't set the 3/4"" pins below the surface of the 1/4"" maple scribe that I was attaching to 3/4 ply using 120 psi. No adjustment to set the depth deeper. In softer woods it would set the pin, but leave a big dimple from the un-padded shoe. After about 30 pins it quit working. The piston would not return to its upper position. Cleaned and lubed and it still wouldn't work. I'm shipping it back and am ordering the Senco. P.C. is catering to the hobbiest now days, not to the professional."
3,mao as a puppet of who knows who,"The problem with this book is that it's very short. All the author's opinions, and his most controversial reviews of any situation have to remain unjustified, and they do remain unjustified. The pre-People's Republic Mao part is the weakest point: the Kuomintang, we read, was corrupt and unefficient, so they lost the power. Bye, bye. Is that all? I certainly believe it shouldn't be all: something like a brief explanation on China's traditional land ownership and Kuomintang policy on the subject (if there ever was one, and I bet there was one, even a fake one) is missed. The other thing I don't like is the explanation of Mao's foreign policy as one of ""poor little scared boy looking for love"". Sometimes, when critizicing US trends towards China, the author seems to forget an important Chinese Characteristic: the People's Republic happens to be Communist."
1,Bored - couldn't watch it,"I just rented this movie and am trying to watch it with no clue what's going on. That's because all of a sudden cleaning out the fridge is more interesting. So if you have some household chores to do, rent this movie and you soon you will have them all done. Totally boring."
5,Lot of useful informations,"I like the way how the book being organized, especially the Chapter 10(A Growth Team). It tells you lot of growth theorys and the same time also show how you can achieve your realistic goal.After read this book, you will understand that there is no magic in growing taller. It is impossible to grow 3 inches in three month. The only thing you can do is starting at early stage and working consistently untill bone matures.I find the following website is helpful before you purchase the book.http://www.yeii.com/"
1,Horrible Audio,Just watched this Bluray last night and was not impressed at all. The sound was below par compared to most concert releases. Total waste of money. The sound does not have the concert feel. Better sound can be had from cassette tapes of 30 years past. It just lacks everything. Even the 2 channel audio was done in dolby digital when there is ample space on the BD to make it PCM. This is an example on how to make a horrible concert audio mix.
4,thunder81650,"bon jovi is very good and has a very good lead guitar player, with that band who could go wrong."
2,"Great idea, poor execution, the LCD display was defective","I really like the idea of a clock phone, as I bought one about 7 years ago from a local close-out retail store, and it is great. This device arrived with some of the segments not working on the LED display, which means you cannot tell what time it is. I took it straight to the local Goodwill when I realized that I could not fix it. Maybe someone will be able to use it as a radio or a phone."
5,An Old Time Comfort,"I grew up watching this movie. And as long as I can remember, it has given me such a comfort throughout my trials medically and emotionally as a child. Although some of the content may ""scare"" young children, it had more of a positive effect on me. All kids are different so I would reccomend that the parent or guardian watch the movie first before you let your child.Anyway, watch the movie with an open mind and let you decide yourself if it's worth seeing again. :)"
4,Family Fare,"I very much enjoyed this movie and think it would be interesting to children from age 5 up and also to adults.Benji was steadfast in his desire to help the children, and the characters were quite believable."
1,"Sad, Misleading",That is all the author did was take declassified FBI records and wrote a book. Most of which the information about WD FARD and Elijah Muhammad were contradictory. Wish I had the time to elaborate. He should be ashamed of writing such. Sad.
4,Please note the language,"This collection of poetry of Heine's is not translated but in the original German. It however, contains an English introduction with English notes on words in the poetry. Very bizarre publication.I myself cannot read German (I plan on learning very soon) so I can't read the poetry now."
3,Good product but...,"I wish they would have told me that the undershirt that is pictured DOES NOT come with it. It is just the overshirt. I thought it was something different. I am happy with the style and the cut and everything else, I just wish I would have known I'd have to buy something to wear under it."
1,One Star For Memetic Self Promotion,"This book is also for review at the writers SKS promotional website where business and writing have mutated into self promotion.Two young guys from very middle class upbringing were seduced in thought and possible practise by a man who is now an invalid, allcoming together shortly after Woodstock, Altamont, Vietnam and the era of so called metaphysical self discovery.This is not Wittgenstein's Poker with Popper and Ludwig W. meeting head to head at Cambridge but a tale of much lesser metaphysicians and philosophers and a sad tale of commune like life.It is sad that the writer and his cadre of supporters did not spend greater time at one of the great Universities for the study of Philosophy (Univ. of Pittsburgh) hbefore imbarking upon a journey which has lead them to a Hegelian like self promotion.For no other reason, this book may be read to understand how to turn a wierd and sickening experience into self promotion."
4,good way to add bike holder,"This is a good way to add a bike holder to your trailer setup, bit I would not use it with a load leveling RV hitch. It is strong enough, it just moves the hitch too far back from the car. Maybe my problem was the to vehicle was a Nissan Xterra, not a truck. Also it is god to extend the hitch past the rear mounted spare tire to have more room for the bikes. Be sure to hook the load to the straight pipe only."
5,QUALITY,"Old school dustpan. Heavy duty and made in the good old USA. About five dollers, shipped to my door. Beat that China, or Wal Mart.."
2,Bob Larson was misleading in his perception of demonology.,His true perception of demons is somewhat distorted through his christian priciples and beliefs. I would recommend this book to those interseted in light reading and slightly misleading demonology. However if one is truly compeled to study demons in their intirety then there are certainly many more accurate books with more detail that are well worth the effort to locate.
1,Hilarious dreck!,"Bob Larson is the funniest man on television. An impotent Cotton Mathers with greasy skin and sleazball suit, he trumpets his gospel of paranoia to a captive audience (most of his parishoners undoubtedly having come from a mental hospital). This book follws the grand tradition of Montegue Summers and Hal Lindsay. Meaning that its a mix of misinformation and fictions arising from a psyche that would make a Freudian scream with delight. Witness the demoniac origin of masturbation illucidated in this massive slander, and see what I mean. Page after page of this book is an insult to every religion besides the authors own. Buddhism, Hinduism, Wicca, and yes, Satanism are all flagrently misrepresented. Larson's exploits among his wicked quaries are enough to make Max Weber give up anthropology and take up coin collecting. Has the man never heard of ""valueless anthropology""? Recomended for a good laugh, after which it should be promptly consigned to the flames of a Solstice needfire."
4,The action hero rocks out!,"Now this is the way an action movie soundtrack should sound.Massive kudos to the people who scored all these tracks. One cursory glance at the track listing should be all it takes to sell you on picking this up.Seriously, AC/DC come blasting off the starting blocks with Big Guns (a minor hit in some territories) and then Alice in Chains pump out What the Hell Have I. It's pretty meaty and there is a plethora of more awesome tracks along the way. Sure Def Leppards Two Steps Behind sucks and Fishbones 'Swim' gets a little tired but it's more than saved by cool stuff like Anthrax, more AIC and a tasty party rock cut by Tesla that just burns on down the highway.And despite the different bands juxtaposed here the whole thing hangs together as a coherent whole. Which ain't easy to do. Take a big swig of this!"
3,Average compilation,"More of a compilation than an actual soundtrack, this soundtrack to Last Action Hero features mostly bands from the 80's and a few questionable tunes, but all together this isn't a bad disc. It's worth the price alone for the Alice in Chains' songs ""What the Hell Have I?"" and ""A Little Bitter"", plus arguably one of Megadeth's best songs in ""Angry Again"", plus the tracks from Def Leppard, AC/DC, Anthrax, and even Cypress Hill are worth noting as well. However, I could have done without Tesla, or Queensryche's overblown cover of ""Real World"", and there's no reason to see Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" on here either. All in all, this isn't a half bad compilation, just don't expect anything too special from it."
2,"Finally, a perfect stand","Look no longer, fellow riders. From the most unexpected place, Husky Bicycles, comes a great stand. Check it out at [...]. Quality materials, low price of only $15 and a perfect solution to keeping bikes securely upright without stressing the spokes! I had to peel an unattractive sticker and it made it perfect. Recommend!"
1,not worth it,"this really shouldn't be purchased. yea its cheap and it appears it might work, but really it doesn't. the bike wants to fall over and it leans against the spokes. spend $40 and get a good metal rack that holds the whole back tire."
1,Broke after first tries with it,"Only use for the smallest of kids bikes, not for a full size person mountain bike its not sturdy enough."
1,I hate it,"My mountain bike doesn't stand level in this stand. Since I have oversize 2.25 inch tires, the stand must be adjusted wider than the spokes for the tire to fit in. The bike tips precariously in the stand, only held by the spokes. Additionally, the unit is hard to assemble.I intend to dump it for something that works."
1,bought a new tire because of too many broken spokes,"The design is fundamentally flawed. The stand puts pressure on the tire spokes. Consequently, the tire spokes will break more often than usual.I visited the bike repair shop 3 times while using this. A total of 9 spokes were broken over 2 months.1 spoke broke. Got it replaced.2 spokes broke. Got them replaced.6 spokes broke. Had to buy a new tire because the tire frame bent too much by this time.All spoke breaks occurred on the back tire where the ""Gear Up Grand Stand"" held my bike.Don't buy this. I put mine in the recycle bin."
4,Portable bike stand,"BLUF- it works as described and is great to keep in the car for before and after a ride instead of laying your bike down or leaning it against the car.Details: I would not store my bike in this stand for any length of time though. Also, have some spare washers around, mine was shipped with 3 correct sized washers and one washer that was way to big."
3,good stand for 20 bucks,its a decent stand but it wont hold any bike of weight if they added or had avalible an option of adding weight to it it would be nice i now use it as an extra stand in the garage im not worried if it gets grabbed because it is tough to carry your best stand around all the time but for on the road or heading out its ok but i wont buy another a great starter stanD thats what it was for me and i do still have it so there it is
5,The Best,If you enjoy very good murder mysteries then I have to tell you that this series is the best by far. It is number one in my book. You will get your monies worth buy buying this box set. I own all four seasons. You will want to watch these over and over again. You too will become a fan of John Nettles.
5,Who doesn't love a good murder mystery?,"Love the scenes, the story lines, the actors...just really great show!!!"
4,the power of goodness,"A story of four Negro solderers in World War II who get caught behind German lines in the small Italian village temporarily vacated by the Germans. The book weaves several believable elements of magical realism, together with war, cruelty, betrayal, revenge, love, courage, forgiveness, and heroism, to present a story of of salvation and survival.It is a story of the brotherhood of man and the power to do good. Read it. You will like it."
4,Wonderful 60's Series!,"I am glad to see this series released to Video....another iconic series from the 60's, which holds special memories for me...again we have series stars, who for the most part were in the beginning or near beginning of their careers, with Doug McClure going on to the Virginian series a few years later, and Sebastian Cabot going on to the butler role in Family Affair. There was much location filming, and as the synopsis indicates, the beautiful and sometimes haunting vistas of San Francisco and the bay area. I have visited there and it is truly one of the most beautiful places in the States... The stories were for the most part very well done with wonderful guest stars from time to time and terrific acting...A welcome addition to the other series of that era...Bravo!"
3,Still waiting,"I read this in about 2 days. It does have an odd twist to it that seems too far-fetched to be a scary one. I guess I was expecting more face to face action with Stuart and the doctor, or more about Stuart's childhood. The character of the girl he lived with really had no depth, and the friendship between her and the ex wife was a bit odd. I think it would have been much scarier had there been more tales of bad things happening to Stuart growing up, not just the operation. That one incident is just not enough to make a person have a dual personality and powers of telepathy, or whatever that was. Where did Owl Man originally come from?"
3,"mmm-just ""ok""","i was mildly entertained but did resort to a little bit of skimming - the ""out there"" plot developments weren't supported enough by meaty character developments. i found many parts predictable, and what wasn't i just didn't feel terribly invested in as a reader. i don't think i would recommend it."
5,"Oh, so this is why","This CD is the most informative when it comes to Indigo, Crystal and Rainbow Children,of any I have heard to date. Doreen lets us understand why these beautiful childern do what they do."
3,Wish i had the solutions manual,"I have used this book for two semesters now andi wish i had hte solutions manual. I would buy it but i dont know which one it is there are so many and James stewart has written many calc books. Overall this book is ok, but i would recommend getting hte solutions manual, whichever it is. And if anyone knows which solutions manual to buy let me know please penguinGamer@gmail.com . Thanks"
5,A look at another world,"This book is a look at a world that few of us inhabit and anyone interested in fashion, high society, and/or Palm Beach will love this book - not to mention the legions of Lilly fans out there. It contains one of the best quotes about Frank Sinatra albums that you'll ever read: Frank Sinatra is always a good choice. And here's the tip to finding the best Sinatra. Look at the photograph or illustration on the cover of the album or CD. If Old Blue Eyes is wearing a hat, the CD is primo. If he's hatless, you're taking your chances (although, with Sinatra, how bad can your chances be?) Simple rule of thumb: hat = good, no hat = no good.I took this out of the library a few times and then finally broke down and bought it. I made a wise decision."
4,Light summery fun,"Yes, Essentially Lilly is frothy, silly and mindless, but like a light angel food cake and berry dessert, that's what summer is about. If you like recipes and entertaining, this book is fun to flip through. One doesn't have to belong to the country club or routinely throw chic parties for a few dozen of her closest friends in order to aspire to such ideas. War and Peace it ain't, but who expected that from Lilly Pulitzer? (Maybe the last name threw some people off.) This is a pretty book with fun party and food ideas, which is sufficient entertainment for a lazy summer day either at the country club, or just dreaming about being part of that scene."
4,"Beautiful, Inspiring,Feel-Good Movie!","I got this from my library and I am so glad that I selected it as one to watch! Not knowing a thing about St.Patrick and since the title said""The Legend Of Ireland"",I went into this as if watching a fantasy film. From just reading the reviews at IMDb,(previously I just looked for it's rating) I now see the historical inaccuracies,but I was not aware of them at the time,and even now,it does not affect my pleasure from seeing this film,nor would it affect my seeing it again. In Fact I enjoyed it enough to order it for my collection.It has inspired me to want to do more research on St.Patrick and the beautiful Ireland as well!"
4,Excellent Product!,This movie gives an excellent depiction of the life and times of the real St. Patrick. This is the best movie of his life I have seen.
2,Based On Mythology Rather Than History,"This is a simplistic made for television movie based on the myths surrounding St Patrick the ""legendary hero"" rather than the facts about the actual historical person. For example, some rather cheesy special effects are used to depict Patrick's supposedly God inspired visions and magical powers.I suppose this could be considered all in good fun, especially for kids. But the problem is that some people are going to believe this is based on real historical events rather than legend and mythology. Of course, the true story of St Patrick the man is far more interesting and I would have preferred a movie about him rather than all this silliness about using magic to defeat the ""evil pagan"" enemies. This film is not worth watching."
2,Only For Completists,"This short novel of paranormal spookiness in a California desert town was found in Leiber's papers several years after his death in 1992. It reads like what it is - a first draft that was never submitted for publication beacuse it wasn't tight or compelling enough, and was set aside and never revised. Leiber was a good enough writer that there are still some effective moments and genuine shudders; you can see what a good story it could have made if he had thought it worth making it that way. As it is, it's mostly a curio for devoted fans."
4,"This Product is the same as ""Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Rockin' Workouts""","I just received my order and this product is just the ""Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Rockin' Workouts"" DVD, which is less expensive. I feel a little ripped off. Be warn, buy the other listing."
4,"Smart, sharp coffee table book","The interviews in the book were originally published in the Independent, the Guardian and Dazed & Confused. They cover a wide range of modern designers and is well-illustrated by the crisply chosen photographs.Particularly nice moments are the interview with Helmut Lang, Vivienne Westwood'sphotographic portrait, and the interview with Paul Smith.Nice to have."
4,Track Listing Information,1 Misled (Album Version) (3:30)2 Misled (The Groove Edit) (4:43)3 Misled (MK Radio Remix Edit) (3:49)4 Misled (Richie Jones Club Mix) (7:22)5 Misled (The Groove Mix) (5:52)6 Misled (MK History Mix) (6:41)
1,Controls are horrible,"If you use the mouse is pretty much impossible to play this game. So I attempted to use the keyboard to steer. When I tap left or right, I go about 90 degress the direction I turned, crashing into whatever is to the left or right of me. Everything else if fine, but everything else is impossible to experience when I can't race because I'm always hitting building and trees because of the super sensitive controls."
4,Change of pace,"This book was different than most of the fantasy books I have read. If I had to describe this work I would say a more sophisticated Stephen Lawhead.With that being said, the reason this book did not get 5 stars from me is because I felt that the book was extremely long winded. I realise that the author was laying ground work for the trilogy but there was to much fluff and not enough action.I will definately pick up the second book to see how he evolves the characters but at this point if book two doesn't move along a little faster I will probably pass on book three."
3,Fluff,"Entertaining but barely touches the surface. Good general book if you aren't looking for a lot of details and don't know anything about nutrition, exercise, etc."
1,Cannot recommend this product,"Usually, I am a big proponent of buying the lowest priced product when it comes to commodity networking devices like NICs. However, I cannot recommend this product if you have Windows XP. Not only did the thing not work after I installed the drivers, but the mere installation of the drivers wreaked havoc on my Windows Services, somehow deleting my NetLogon keys. I'll have to rebuild my machine because of this cheap device.It's a shame that the US Robotics brand has gone so far downhill."
4,must donwload new driver form it;s website,"In both winXP or Win2K, you must download the new driver for robstics.com for this card. otherwise, it not work on wireless access point."
5,Really bright,"This is my 2nd Honda (CR-V 2002) and just like my accord, the original light bulbs or other regular ones were not bright enough, nor did they project the beams very far (without high beams.) Some of my friends who drive other Honda models made the same comments. I even had the headlights checked for height adjustment -thinking that it might be too low. It was not. So when one bulb burned out, I started researching. I didn't buy Sylvania's equivalent to the GE NightHawk because too many reviews said that they only last 6 months. Hopefully, GE will last longer (could not find any reviews); but in the meantime, they really live up to the advertisement: brighter & longer beam of light.GE 9003NH/BP2 NightHawk Automotive Replacement Bulbs - Pack of 2"
2,GE 9003NH/BP2 Nighthawk,"Very disappointed...They are just a little brighter than the OEM'sI'll say about 5% better.I do not recommend anyone getting this, it is a waste of money, look for Sylvania bulbs they are much much better than this!"
1,I thought it would be brighter...,"From all the reviews here and a few other sites, I got the impression that these would be far brighter than OEM bulbs, and thus quickly bought them.I had the original Silverstars previously, and although those weren't any brighter than my OEM bulbs, their lighter color light made things appear brighter at night. Those bulbs, though, lasted less than a year.This GE bulb is the same color as OEM, but GE claims 30% more luminance than OEM. I don't see it.On the bright (no pun intended) side, a year and a half later these are still going strong, but still no brighter than OEM.Disappointed in the performance."
2,This was not really a good movie,"This was not really a good movie. Not only was it a bit boring but also it was supposed to be a free download as some sort of gift to me from amazon, however, it was never downloaded, it just played on my computer once. Still, it was a good lesson for me. I will never attempt to purchase a downloadable movie through amazon because of this issue."
2,NOT THAT GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LIKE BUDDY GUY ALOT AND HAVE MOST OF HIS CD'S, HOWEVER THIS DVD IS NOT THAT GREAT. I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE HIS CONCERT FROM THE CD BY THE SAME NAME, WHICH IS GREAT. THIS DVD IS SHOT AT VERY CLOSE ANGLES AND ALMOST IN BLACK AND WHITE. THE CONCERT FOOTAGE IS DONE IN A KIND OF A DRAB BROWN COLOR. THIS IS A BIOGRAPHY DVD ALSO. LITTLE INTERVIEWS MIXED IN WITH THE SHOW.ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN BUDDY KNOWS HOW INTENSE HE CAN BE IN CONCERT AND THATS PART OF HIS CHARM, BUT THIS DVD LEAVES ME FLAT. THERE ARE OTHER SHOWS ON EBAY THAT ARE MUCH BETTER SUCH AS THE NORTH SEA JAZZ FESTIVAL SHOW IN 2002. IF YOU WANT SOME REAL BUDDY GUY, THATS THE ONE............"
5,I Can't Get Enough!,"This is a really nice recording of Buddy Guy and the SNL Band live at The Legends in Chicago. The recording is a little raw and unprocessed, which is just fine with me. I hate it when they sterilize these kinds of recordings. Buddy and G.E. interact really well, and the band does a terrific job.I wish we had more legitimate DVDs of people like Buddy though. There just aren't enough out there, and I hate buying bootlegs because these artists got ripped off enough otherwise, and it seriously bugs me that people will sell the music of people like Buddy Guy without paying anything to the artists. It's a matter of principle for me to not support bootleg sales regardless of how much I like the music."
5,Great for kids that are sensitive to loud noises!,"I bought these for my 5 year old son who is very sensitive to loud noises for a trip to Disney World. The fireworks, shows, and some rides are very loud at the various parks. My son had a much more enjoyable trip and the ear muffs gave him confidence to try things that he would otherwise not have done. The muffs are adjustable where the ear muff connects to the head band and can fit an infant to a small adult. The Disney trip alone made this purchase worthwhile, but we will continue to use these for a variety of activities for a long time to come."
3,"Not Terrible, Not Exceptional","From a mother's point of view, it wasn't terrible and it wasn't exceptional either. There were a few lessons taught and Ariel made a deaf friend who used sign language, which was pretty interesting. My daughter, age 2 1/2 started learning a couple of signs by watching the movie and as always, she loved Ariel, Cinderella and Jasmine. Out of all the Princess DVDs I've reviewed, so far, this one is the best."
3,Average,"My daughter, who is 5, loves the Disney princesses. She really likes this DVD.. I didn't find it to be any more frightening than any of the Disney movies featuring Belle, Jasmine, Ariel or Cinderella.. I do wish all 4 had been animated stories, but she loves it in any case. I did love the song at the end, with all the princesses singing.."
2,Not so good as I thought,"I've bought it last week and viewed it yesterday. I think the menu was very beautiful, but the stories in it were not so good except ""Wish upon a starfish"". But this story is old, I thought the stories in this DVD are new! Well, the best thing in this DVD is ""If you can dream"" Music Video. I love this song very much. It was featured in the album named ""Disney Princess Tea Party"", and I will buy this CD this summer holiday."
1,Plot weak and book full of contradictions - heroine total b****.,"I was very disappointed with this book. The heroine, Jennifer, answers an ad for a mail order bride, and travels all the way to Montana from New York City, to then want to return almost as soon as she reaches her destination. She is a witch to her husband, and I actually was hoping he would get an annulment so we could move on to a more likeable heroine.The hero, Luc, starts out as being an obnoxious bully, but soon turns into an extremely caring and patient man. He was so patient in fact, that I found it hard to believe he would put up with his wife's behavior, especially when she leaves him to open a boarding house in town. I thought he would be shouting, ""Hallelujah! and good riddance"" from his roof top and shaking her dust from his doorstep when she left.All in all, I was very disappointed with this one, but I would recommend this author's other works, as they are far better written."
5,Nice sing along cd,"My 4 year old loves this cd. As they sing words are along the bottom of the screen that light up. It is cute, fun, and colorful. If your daughter likes princesses she will probably love this."
4,My Daughter Loves This Video,"My 3 year old daughter loves this video. She hasn't even seen all the movies, but she loves her princesses. Great product!"
4,Three year old daughter loves this,"We don't have television in our house and my daughter has never seen a Disney movie (not yet at least... they're a bit harsh for someone so small in my opinion).With that said, she LOVES the Disney Princess music CD we got from the library and I was planning to make a YouTube playlist with each of the princesses singing their respective songs (the best of each movie, minus the negative/scary aspect) but then I found this DVD and voila!As a parent I can tune out the parts that are annoying but I agree with other reviewers that the narrator is not only ridiculous but trite even. But whatever.... my daughter is happy and I don't have to worry about Disney movies for another year at least :)Agreed also that it would be nice to be able to turn off the lyrics that pop on the screen - although maybe it'll be useful as my daughter learns to read.We'll likely get the other two DVDs in this series."
4,3 yr old likes it,"My 3 year-old daughter really liked this video right away. She has watched it several times. I like the music except for the pop version of bibbidi bobbidi boo, they've ruined that one. Also, can't help wondering if we want to encourage the idea that girls should wait for a prince to come and save them. There is a lot of that in the video. Otherwise it is enjoyable, even for me."
3,Sing Along Songs Vol. 1,"My 3-year-old loves it, but I think there should be more songs on it for the price of the DVD."
2,Not at all for young kids,"Hi,Almost all the songs in here are about love between youngadults, men/women, so I don't think it's a good idea to exposeyoung chuildren to such type of love too early, too soon."
2,The Magic School Bus Inside a Beehive,"This series was recommended for my 5-year-old grandson who reads on a third grade level and is interested in living things and science. However, I was disappointed with it and did not give it to him. I felt it gave TOO MUCH new info on each page for a child so young. He will get it when he's a bit older. Other books in the series may be great, but this was all I could find available through Amazon."
5,Very Educational,This children's book describes in great detail the life of honey bees and how they make honey. It is every very interesting and informative for adults too.
3,Small simplistic expensive,"This is a very small book,a very simplistic book and a very expensive book. One saving grace is that it is beautifully printed."
4,chain saw chain sharpener,"This product works well. Big improvement over simple hand held products. Made of simple pot metal. Not a high quality instrument, but the price does reflect the quality. You get what you pay for."
4,Great buy!,This saw sharpener is great. Highly customizable and let's you only take off how much metal you feel is necessary. Worth the money to sharpen yourself.
3,catchy Jam,Before Nelly there was another Cat from St.Louis&His Name was Domino but He was riding on the West Coast Flavor almost a Decade ago.this Jam was catchy&had a Cool video as well.
4,Great for work snack,I ordered these to bring into work to add some 'salty' to the sweet snacks we always have here. They are great! Everyone loves having them around. I'll gladly order them again when the supply has diminished.
1,slim jims no good!,"I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make ""mechanically separated"" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste ""good""? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..pEEWWW!!!"
1,False advertising,"I attmepted to ""step into a Slim Jim"" as the commercial instructed me. What a load of false advertising! Not only was this maneuver difficult to execute, the experience was extremely uncomfortable and it took me days to wash off the smell of processed dried beef."
4,Slim Jims,"Slim Jim Meat Sticks, Original, 0.28-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 100)These were a great snack to have around."
2,Dry and very salty,I bought the 100 pack of slim jims and they were very bad. They were very hard almost like jerky. They also had a lot more salty taste to them.
4,slim jims,Pretty awesome. These make a good morning snack to start the day. The last few packages have had very crisp tasting snacks
3,"Great Price, Not Healthy","If you are a fan of Slim Jim, buying this package is perfect. Each Slim Jim is packed in a small, snack sized plastic wrap and the price is really great for the 100 Slim Jims this package offers. With that said, this is not the most healthy product...think, sodium, preservatives, fat, and the list goes on...If you are okay with the health factor though, this package is great."
4,Closet Slim Jim Eater,"The quality of the shipment and it's contents was great and on time. There were no problem with the order. I can't give it an excellent rating, though, just due to the fact of its contents. Not that I did ot know that a the time of purchase. It a grossly proceessed food, which is probably why I like it. I'm the only one eating them in the houe and they're just about Finished."
1,Makes me wanna puke!!!,Boy are these bad!Bit into the first one.Pasty stuff inside with a slightly crunchy cover.Spit it out immediately.They taste like some unidentifiable chemical and smell bad.My dog ate a few small bites I cut off then refused any more.I feel bad donating these to the food bank but off they go.
2,No snap,"They just dont have that slim jim snap. Really, they are kind of gross. m brother seems to like hem though so all is not lost."
3,SYBIL meets THE BREAKFAST CLUB,"Not-too-gory psychological horror, very woman oriented. This average-looking girl gets reamed at school by all the rich, beautiful ones-- like so many teen movies-- but she has a hip chick friend from childhood who appears to help her deal with them in interesting ways...I liked it because the women characters were interesting for a change,and the actors weren't the usual Hollywood plastic types."
3,Am I an,"I take an important medicine at an odd time of day, I was continually forgetting to take this med. For this reason the clock is perfect. The clock is bigger and heavier than I expected. My children say that I look like Flavor Flav, the singer-rapper."
5,Awesome.,"I adore the Sony PSP headphone (with remote) and having them in black is even better. Looks great, sounds great, feels great. Makes every game I play sound optimal. The PSP has excellent audio output and these headphones let you know it."
5,Beta Fun!,"I have been on beta for a while and every patch they add just makes the game even better. It's geared towards a very team oriented style of playing. Commander has a very daunting task of keeping everything running smoothly but the ability to allow other players to take part of his command is a nice addition.The game play is very melee based. Weaponry is fantastic but usually you run out of ammo quickly and must resort to melee. Melee in and of its self takes great skill and is great fun. I and a few other testers have even had melee duels which are quite entertaining.The weaponry is very diverse, from standing halfway across the map and sniping people with a bow; to running into the heat of the battle with a flamethrower. There are guns for every type of player and every type of situation.The S2 team is very involved with this game; they are always there taking suggestions and fixing bugs. They are very friendly team and it has been great working with them thought this beta so far."
3,Do it yourself blood test,"The most difficult part with this is trying to get enough blood on the dip stick. And if you don't get enough blood, it is very hard to read. We had ordered 4 kits, one for each member of the family, and ended up using 2 kits on one person. I probably would not spend the money on these again, I would probably just go to the doctor and get it done."
4,Blood Type Kit,"I purchased this to find my blood type before a mission trip to Buenos Aires. We had to know our blood type in case something happened. It was really easy to use, and well worth the purchase price. If you aren't sure of your blood type, I recommend buying a kit like this. The information could one day save your life."
5,Worked just as stated,I've wanted to know my blood type for a few years now and my doctors either kept telling me that it's not necessary to test for blood type or asked for $200. Donating my blood is not an option at the moment because I do not meet the weight requirements. So I ordered this and it came today. I tried this right away and everything worked exactly as it said it would. The directions are very straightforward. I had no problems at all and got more than enough blood for the test (and I have naturally cold hands!). I found out that my blood type is AB+ and I found the whole process really interesting.
2,not efficient use of time,"My experience is that as tiresome as it is do clay by hand; the ""hand"" process was much more efficient and productive than using the ""PAD"""
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,THIS BOOK IS A PIECE OF CRAP AND A WASTE OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT. I WOULD SUGGEST READING STUFF OFF THE INTERNET AND READING JOURNALS RATHER THAN WASTE TIME WITH THIS PIECE OF TOILET PAPER. I AM GONNA FLUNK THE CLASS CUZ OF THIS PEICE OF CRAP BOOK.DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!AAAHHHHH!!!!
4,good book,"If you are looking for a good physical chemistry textbook at a graduate study level, this is a good one."
2,Damaged,Both items looked new however both have ripped covers.Not happy with Amazon quility control.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"This was exactly what I had hoped to find for a friend who is an avid coin collector. He was thrilled to have received this and within a few days after Christmas, went to work and placed all of the quarters that he had into the books with ease."
3,Not very happy with the quality,"I just received this and I tend to agree with most that it has got a very flimsy backing to hold the quarters and also I'm not sure whether this is intended to be split into two parts but when I opened, it actually tore midway and I now literally have two albums one for the P and the other for D quarters ...is that how it was meant to be? or did I get a bad egg?"
2,Needs a Hammer,The coins are very difficult to get in the holes. Although I like the layout of the book (P's & D's together) you can only see one side of the coin.
1,Not top quality,"This item was worn on the edges and didnt live up to what was promiced, but you get what you pay for."
1,A waste of money,"The Leg Thing slides down my calf every five minutes, requiring me to pull it back up in order to prevent my insulin pump from dangling and swinging freely inside my pants leg. This is very annoying. The material stretches out too much and is too slippery to stay in place against the skin. Even washing and drying it don't seem to help. I wish it stayed in place at the top of my calf instead of sliding down to my ankle all the time."
3,"Probably good, but you might already own what you need","I haven't bought one of these, and it's probably as good as it's described. However, as I was reading the description, I wondered why any woman would spend $20 for it when you probably already have the necessary items at home. What I've done is to put my pump in the elastic top of my knee-high stockings. And when I wanted to wear a long summer dress with casual sandals, I used an old pair of knee-highs. I cut off and saved the elastic part (the elastic tops of my knee-highs are at least 3"" long) from the lower portion (which I tossed), then put my pump in the same spot, inside the elastic. This is worth a try - even worth buying a pair at the drugstore if you don't normally wear them. And if you don't like it, THEN you can buy the ""Leg-Thing""!"
5,Freaking. Awesome.,"Right, I love this book. Alot. That's about all there is to it. I'm a wannabe writer by trade, and my biggest problem in writing is that I can never come up with realistic sounding human names. THis book has... more than I could ever need, Male, Female, and Surname, arranged first by nationality, and then alphabetical order if I remember correctly."
3,"Interesting, but lacking balls","I suppose they might have just run out of ideas by this time. Or somebody just blurted out, ""hang it up, Howard!"" Or John McGeoch was a much more talented musician than whoever is the replacement guitarist for this record. At least I felt some intense emotion listening to their classic albums, Real Life and Secondhand Daylight. Those are my all time favorites, and I'd hands down recommend either of those 2 albums over this. This one's decent, just kinda out there."
1,dissapointed. don't buy. not a complete set.,"very disappointed. though the product site matched this for my vehicle, when tried to put this it doesn't fit on. when compared with the old one, found this doesn't have an extension leaver for proper fit. end up paying too much for new one as the vehicle already in mechanic hands."
5,Excellent results,The negative reviews made ma a little wary. I have to agree the plants looked near death on arrival. There were no green leaves on any of the root stock... for the first 24 hours. 49 of the 52 plants were thriving after 48 hours. (One blew away in the wind and we never found it again.) I chose to follow the advise from a review that said to soak the plants even though the instructions say not to. I covered them with water and an ounce of VF11 liquid fertilizer. My ground was prepared before the plants arrived with a small amount of chicken composted manure and top soil in a raised bed. The raised bed was covered with weed block and holes were cut for the plants every 12 to 14 inches. The soil was kept moist but not saturated. The temperature here is in the 60's and 70's day and night.
4,strawberry plants and amazon,The plants were in good shape when we received them. We have transplanted them and they are doing good. We are very satisfied with the product. It was the first time we had purchased anything like that on line and it was very nice. Also amazon.com was very nice. My friends had order through amazon.com before but I never have and it was a good experience.Thank youSandra West
4,"Sweet, but was shorted","I was thrilled to find the plants on Amazon, for a good price. We ordered two sets of 50 plants. Previous reviews cautioned me to expect wilted, nearly dead plants, but our plants were perfect! We did plant them immediately. The only down side is that our order was shorted 27 plants. I contacted the seller and they did issue an immediate credit, but I would have preferred the plants. I will order again next year."
3,worth the money,These strawberries multiplied to fill my entire 4'x4' plant bed. They produce many berries but they are small and a little bitter. Maybe next year they will mature into better tasting strawberries.
5,strawberry-Evie Everbearing,"Arrived within two days. All plants were healthy, even got a extra one. they are all growing nicely. Can't wait to eat them."
2,OK if you like Philip Glass,"I loved Touré's ""Talking Timbuktu"" and was looking forward to hearing this album after reading strong reviews of it in the New York Times. Sorry to say, I found it disappointing and bordering on irritating.While the production values are wonderful, with a warm and plangent sound, there's only so much you can do on two chord harmony. Tracks 2 through 5, plus a couple of others later on, are basically long improvisations on two chords that are played repeatedly by Touré while Diabate plays beautiful filigree over the top. If that's your thing, buy this album and you'll enjoy it. But without even the benefit of vocals to enliven the harmonics, I found myself fast-forwarding to the next track, and then fast-forwarding again. Some of the later tracks sound like reworkings of tracks from Talking Timbuktu. Altogether, too repetitive for me."
2,Hum X,"I bought this after reading countless articles about people picking up audio hum in there vid/aud eq. For experimenting which would work, i wanted to try something cheaper, but i spent the $$$ & tried the expensive HUM X, which DID NOT work for me.. Amazon had other things I tried, the Raptor which did do some good vs the $$$HUM X.. I Was VERY DISSATISFIED....!!!!"
4,"Great for standard staples, but too flimsy for heavy-duty staples","Works great for gently removing standard staples from paper, magazines, or bulletin boards (much better than the ""claw"" style), BUT... the thin metal and plastic are WAY TOO FLIMSY to use for removing those heavy-duty paper staples (the kind used for 25+ sheets), or staples from wood/upholstery, or those big copper-color box staples.It may be obvious, but to use the stapler you simply push it forward under the staple and the staple wire is gently pulled out of the holes (the INCORRECT way to use it is to stick it under the staple and try to pry it up, which can make a mess of your paper just like the old ""claw"" style)."
1,Don't waste your time or money on the Craig,"What junk...I got my Craig DVD player for Christmas and use it at work frequently. Last night after about an hour of use (running solely on the battery) the screen went black. I assumed it the battery dying so I shut it off and forgot about it until today. I plugged it in and nothing. Black screen. Within five minutes of trying different outlets around the office the whole player started to act up. The speakers were popping and the standby light was flashing randomly. I can't get it to charge, play, or even load a disc.I called Craig Electronics customer service directly (at 2:30am) and they were friendly enough and told me to ship it to the plant in Florida and I would have a replacement within 10 days.I'm afraid after reading all these reviews and from what happened to mine that it's just going to happen again."
2,Great Price Poor Quality,I bought the Craig DVD player so far it works fine but after watching a movie on it for more then an hour it completley shuts down. I would not recommend to anyone.
3,For fans only,"This album is a tribute to P5. It has the P5 classics interpreted mostly by japanese artists. Interesting for fans, but misleading for primers - it does not capture the anarchical creativity of the original versions."
2,Beware: Lens Motor Life Span Is Short,"The Canon A40 is simple to operate and takes decent images with its 2 megapixel/3x zoom features. It's compatible with a Macintosh OS/X and the digital imaging edit software is easy to use. After six months, the lens jammed and the camera did not function properly. I mailed the camera back to Canon for repair and less than six months later, the lens broke again while I was changing batteries. I googled the Canon A40 and learned that other consumers have experienced the same lens jam problem with their Canon A40. If you buy it, be sure to read the warranty details and have the 800-number ready to call. Good luck."
5,Best all purpose camera available,"Once you get a feel for the manual controls, you'll find this camera can take pictures anywhere, in any light.The body of the camera feels sturdy and is very rugged. The controls are easy to press and manipulate. And, the LCD is bright and easy to see. The viewfinder, like on most point-and-shoot cameras, is a little small, but still accurate enough to allow you to frame your shot.The automatic settings are great for taking snapshots in most conditions. However, the manual controls allow for unbelievable versatility and allow you to shoot in almost any condition.The software that comes with the camera is easy to use and install, although I find it a little over-the-top. It's a little too flashy for it's own good.Overall, the Canon A40 is an unbelievable camera."
3,DEFINATELY not for younger kids,Scary segments and references to Satan and hell. Should be rated PG-13.
1,Oh dear!,What a let down! I read the reviews and saw all the stars and thought it must be good but boy was I wrong! This is no Wallace & Gromit!
3,Price is okay. Just not up to snuff.,"I (like just about everyone else who has bought this) expected it to be more of a rough/early Nick Park production. While the title film ""Creature Comforts"" is entertaining, the other three films really didn't measure up. I know this was done well before most of the Wallace and Gromit work, but it doesn't stand up very well on its own. If they would have had some ""Making Of..."" special features talking about how the techniques led to W&G or Chicken Run, I could have enjoyed it quite a lot. But, by themselves, the four shorts just aren't all that great."
4,Not for kids,"It's not exactly for kids, but Creature Comforts and the accompanying skits are great. My favorite is Creature Comforts (and the lion), and Not Without My Handbag cracks me up every time I watch it."
2,It is all right,"It is not a bad movie but I don't think it's the best of Park. I tought two of the shorts were a little mature for my 5 year old, specially the one titled ""Not without my handbag""."
3,Great for Claymation fans,"I've always liked the earlier Aardman Animations, and more recently Wallace & Gromit and Chicken Run. This DVD is worth getting just for ""Creature Comforts"" and ""Not Without my Handbag"". The rest of the short claymation films are OK, but not worth watching more than a few times-- and don't be fooled, it's not for kids, some of the themes are pretty dark. Otherwise, this collection of short claymations is worth it for the price, and if you like other Aardman Animations (Wallace & Gromit, Chicken Run), you will definitely enjoy this DVD."
2,lightweight,"After getting this home, I was a bit disappointed with the stories that make up the four cartoons. ""Not Without My Handbag"" almost makes this dvd worth its value, but this collection has precious little of the whimsy and flavor that made ""Chicken Run"" enjoyable.This is a rental."
4,Great Live Performance,"I saw Arizing at the Emerson in Indianapolis and was truly blown away, before that night I didn't know who they were but after their performance, I went and bought their cd Womb and shook all their hands and talked to them. Being a musician myself (bassist) I could respect their playing ability. The CD is very good, the only reason I could not give it 5-stars is because I truly believe they are better live, I will definitely be checking out their 2nd CD."
1,Poor Portrayal of the Life and Loves of Alma Mahler,"Having been an avid afiocionado of Gustav Klimt and femme fatale Alma Mahler, I bought ""Bride of The Wind"" with a great deal expectation. Script was shoddily written and character development turned out to be very weak, not to mention a complete lack of credibility/chemistry between Wynter & Perez in their portrayal of Alma Mahler's & Oscar Kokoschka's tumultuous whirlwind affair.You'd be better off spending your money on books on the Austrian art scene instead. My top recommendations - (1) Wiener Werkstatte: Design in Vienna 1903-1932 by Christian Branstatter (Abrams) and (2) Kokschka and Alma Mahler by Alfred Weidinger (Prestel)."
2,at least Tom Lehrer had wit . . .,"This film is nice to look at and has a nice score. All in all, the production values - the set design, the costuming, the score - are wonderful.But - the script is poorly written; it seems as though the author found a collection of quotes by the various characters, and then set out to write a movie about Alma, casting her as a victim.But Alma was no victim - she was beautiful, intelligent, and in possession of an innate ability to attract men of the highest caliber - and she wasn't afraid to use it.Ms. Wynter completely fails to capture the wit and intelligence of Alma, and as a result, she comes off more like a fin du siecle version of Paris Hilton.Will someone please take the sets and costuming of this film, and give us a movie which shows us the real Alma - not this wimpy, self-pitying emotional midget."
3,Thought bells were included :(... but the case is nice.,"Was under the impression the bells were included in this order - upon review, I did see that is was annotated, but I wish they would have put it in bold up at the TOP!"
1,Buggy,"The software initially seems good as everything is easy to use and there are allot of features.But when you take this software to a production environment, the bugs start destroying your day. Crashed and corrupted files is the biggest headache. How would you like to work on a file all day, just to have it crash and become corrupted? This happens at least three times a week for each person! We backup the drawings every hour to a new file. Why always to a new file? Well, somtimes you think you are working on a good file until you close it and then later cannot re-open it. You then have to trace back through all the versions to see when it got corrupted!"
3,It's okay,Cannoli making is an art and requires a great recipe. I'm not an artist and I have yet to find a great cannoli recipe.
4,A Good Study Guide,"I read the guide 3 times, took the practice tests and did great. Finished the test in 30 minutes and scored in the 70's. This study guide was good. I used other Comex guides, and found them lacking, but this one is complete. Several sample questions were virtually identical to questions on the CLEP test."
1,Bootleg!,"This is an unauthorized, illegal release of Attack of the Monsters (Gamera vs. Guiron). Kadokawa Pictures has not authorized this release. Get the high-quality DVD coming out this September from Shout! Factory."
1,extra copy,There are two problems with this printer. The main one is when you create a document in word or works you get a summary sheet that can't be eliminated. Not so bad if it only appears once but if you print 10 copies you get ten extra summary sheets. Its such a waste of ink and paper. The other problem is you can't cancel the printing. You go thru the steps it says it will but doesn't. The print is clear but can't live with the extra summary sheets find it annoying.
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book because I wanted to read a book about KIERKEGAARD. Instead I got one that focuses as much as Hegel and Kart as it does on Kierkegaard. I would not recommend this book. This is a disappointment because I have several other books in this series, Islam, Judaism, Descartes, etc, and they are all very well written. This one strays fromt he true topic way too often."
4,Provides some closure for fans,"The thing about this book is that when it's good it's really good, and when it's bad....well it's awefull. It is a compilation of essays from various people about the show Firefly, meaning multiple authors. Now when you have multiple authors your quickly going to find yourself loving how some write and detesting how others do. So the parts you enjoy never last long enough, and the parts that you don't enjoy, well they drag on. This is certainly a worthy purchase for fans of the show, and will give you some closure, especially the writtings of Jewel Staite(Kaylee). However some of the essays are garbage, pompous, and frankly I sometimes wondered if these people where watching the same show."
5,A manual for mindful parents,"This book is intelligently written and thorough. It would make a fabulous basic infant care book for a new parent, as well as a thought-provoking read for an experienced one."
5,"Simple, Clear, Imformative - what more could you want","Hey, I'm no writer, so I'll be brief. I think this book could save lives. The author does an excellent job of defining that ever-so-careful balance between respectful love & indulgence. This is no recipe for brats! This is exactly how we raised our children, now 18 & 21. It's great to see our philosophy shared with others. This stuff really works. And on top of that, the book simply reads well. In this world of baby-wise me-me-me work and wealth hunting, Granju's book comes not a moment too late. More power to ya, lady!"
3,A worthwhile read for expectant parents,"This book would have been a lot more helpful if I'd picked it up four months ago when I was still pregnant, and didn't think I could trust my instincts on what's appropriate in regard to co-sleeping and baby wearing, etc. It definitely gives a first-time parent some good food for thought, but can be preachy and inflexible at times, too. Most of the stuff she goes over (and over, and over...sh'e pretty redundant) was pretty instinctive for both me and my husband. But like any book on the subject of parenting, I think you can take what you need from it and leave the rest. Your child is your best teacher, and children are INDIVIDUALS. Worth reading, but take it with a grain of salt, and trust your own instincts."
2,"Great for baby bonding, bad for SIDS aspect.","I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS."
2,"High on the preaching, low on practicalities","This book would make a great shower gift or source of information for those curious about what attachment parenting is. However, if you are already sold on the idea and are looking for a nitty-gritty how-to book, this is not the one. It spends most of its time justifying the methodology, and not enough time explaining how to implement it. Skip this book, for example, if you have already decided to breastfeed--its main focus is to convince you to do that."
1,Ridiculous and Farfetched,After reading the first 30 pages of this book I could only think that Dr. Phil must be kidding. Creating a self is a life's work --not an overnight venture that can be accomplished by reading this book. Sad. Very sad indeed!!
1,Depressed? Buy this to get further depressed,"(Even one star is too high of a rating!)I'm not as qualified as other reviewers but here I go any way. This was the first book I read by Dr Phil and what a disappointment. I 'was' a fan of his TV show until I read this book!I found myself getting depressed while reading 2/3's of the book and simply stopped reading it. We all know our past experiences impact who we are and how we got where we are. He really did not need to take up 120 pages telling us that.I turned to ""Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential"" by Pastor Joel Osteen to pick up the pieces. :)It's a matter of preference but if I want to feel better about who I am as a person I'd rather not read something to make me relive experiences that I have already come to terms with.If you want to get positive about life, go for something POSITIVE. But it is NOT this book!Good luck!"
2,Disappointing,"I spent a lot of time on the first half of the book only to discover that when you get to Chapter 7, Locus of Control, there is no information on how to score the tests in appendix A and B and yet the chapter is all about how your score affects you. I am very disappointed and have emailed Dr. Phil in hopes that he will at least put the test scoring information on his website. Meanwhile I've spent a lot of time on the previous chapters and now feel like I wasted my time and my money. I must say, I feel quite disappointed."
4,House cleaning for spring-McGraw's Self Review,"lively and quick to read. When you reach the point, you have something. And that something is tangible in the form of your own interesting reactions that you keep to yourself totally(and no one knows why-how you got renewed). Or -you can see yourself in writing, where your answers to some questions are plainly available to refer to. 10 critical events made in your life that most influenced you can be a list. And as well, it can be a write up in a long detailed form of paragraphs and then even a whole story scenario. 7 pivotal people in your life-well you get to see there were that many. and 5 critical decisions that determind roads your life took is yet another dig deep, just do it method advocated. The feeling remaining from reading this how to helper-housecleaning done. And a good job done too."
5,Refreshing modern version of traditional philosophy,"This book, like Dr. McGraw's others, is enormously practical and helpful for anyone seriously interesting in changing himself. Recently I read Aristotle Would Have Liked Oprah: Lessons for Living, which provides insights from different philosophers on how we can better live our lives, and I was amazed after reading Self Matters how similar McGraw's suggestions are to those of Aristotle and Socrates. For anyone who has found Dr. Phil's recommendations to be helpful, I would definitely suggest reading Aristotle Would Have Liked Oprah as well - makes you appreciate how fundamental Dr.McGraw's advice is."
1,Marketing Over Mind,"This book is a marketing piece--not a well thought out, provoking book that can change your life. What is so amazing is that Dr. Phil thinks we have multiple selfs and that just by shere will alone we can go from our untrue self to our real self. Ridiculous! He gives a layman's definition of self that philosophers would cringe at and goes on and on with stories that fill the page, but don't further the subject matter. He paints the self as stagnate, but it seems to me that it is fluid. I mean, afterall are we the same people that we were 10 or 20 years ago? Dr. Phil is good at selling books and dishing out simple ideas, but as a reader I wanted much more!"
1,Errors,"Page 54: ignore the formulas. They should be: Congruency Score (in %)=100 X Actual Self Score (divided by) Total Potential Score.And in Appendix A and B, here is the code: A=8, AS=6, DS=4, D=1."
2,Almost but Did Not make it,Idea is sound but he seems to jump around a bit too much. Should have focused on the 10-7-5 questions and brought them successfully to the end point. He could have left all the other ideas for another less interactive book. If you only think of this book as just another self-help book - your read will be enjoyed.
1,"You've got a lot to answer for, Stephen Covey!","Ever since the phenomenal sales of Stephen Covey's ""7 Habits of somebody or other"", self-development books have been swamped with numbers.In McGraw's last book it was the 10 Life Rules. But why stop there?This time round it's:- Your Ten Defining Moments- Your Seven Critical Choices- Your Five Pivotal People- and a Five-Step Action PlanNot to mention a good smattering of the sort of psuedo-psychological self-tests that are usually reserved for magazines like Cosmopolitan, etc.To end with, then, here's another list:1. If you seriously believe that all of life can be reduced to a set of trivial rules, and that self-denigration is a valuable learning tool, then buy this book - it will tell you exactly what you want hear.2. If your IQ is larger than your shoe size, why on earth would you want to waste your money on this kind of no-brainer nonsense?"
5,Challenge of a lifetime,"This book is not some innocent read. Potentially, it challenges the reader to take a serious look at his or her life - stop clinging to things they dont really want and start working for better things.Surely, most people probably find safety in the status quo, but this is not a book for them. Instead, this is a book for people who actually wants change. And what a great book it is !-Simon"
5,In your face motivator,"This book is quite insightful but first and foremost a great ""in your face"" motivator! Dr. Phil's writing style is very compelling and many of the excercises he introduces in this book are very useful. This is an excellent practical tool for finding yourself. It tells you exactly what to do and when to do it. If you are interesting in what to do but not too interested in how it works, this is a great book! If you are actually interested in how it works, the theory behind it, read ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato. Though Sato's book is not an in your face motivator, it is extremely insightful and interesting. It explains how our we have become the person we are and where we are headed and what we can do to facilitate the process. Both books are super good for different reasons!"
5,good quality tools,"Exactly as the picture shows, quality seem to be pretty good. I haven't really used them much, but it's a big pain when you need them and don't have them."
5,You've Got to Have a Backup,"Always keep a backup and this is the perfect fit. The rotary clicks slightly, the feet have good rubber grips, would't be without this one. I have one at work and one at home."
3,good,"Program music is that you hear on TV and in film. Today, it is usually odorless synthesizer wash, but in the 1970s, it was funk.Brass Knuckles is such. The title track here sounds like instrumental Blood Sweat and Tears on Blood Sweat and Steroids. Lots of big guitars, echoing horns, and jolly green giant bass. Similar treatments are given to the Beatles ""Come Together,"" and Don McClean's ""American Pie."" Fender Rhodes, guitars that sound like sitars, many a 70s treatment you can dream of is here.During its era this music was dismissed as cheese. But we have come to value funk much more now--and this qualifies-and the mass availability of what we thought was gone forever means mass reevaluation.I am not always crazy about the popifying of a alot of the rock here, but Brass Knuckles can be quite entertaining in its largess. Not essential, but a lot of fun."
1,2012=Y2K Hysteria,"This is the third book by Jenkins propounding the silly hypothesis that in 2012 The World Will End! It is totally false and strangely resembles the Y2K hysteria in 2000 that never materialized. In 2012 Mayan cycles simply continue, as they have for millenia, in fact the new cycle is predicted to be a much better one than the one we are leaving, thank goodness. Why people write such silly books and why others publish them strikes me as the real problem, i.e. education. There are dozens of excellent books on the Maya that explain the calendar but silly ones like this keep coming along. Oh well, such is capitalism. I'd save my momeny and not buy this nutty book."
1,I must be missing something.....I was disappointed.,"Unfortunately, I am going to return this book. The weight program is very thorough, but nothing new. The meal plans seemed very restrictive and limiting. All (and I mean ALL 28) of the dinners consist of 4 - 6 ounces of broiled meat or seafood and 12 ounces of a vegetable. Day 21 is 4 ounces of broiled venison with 12 ounces of okra. Day 26 - 4 ounces broiled sea bass and 12 ounces sauteed red bell peppers. A typical breakfast is 2 slices multi-grain bread with a Spanish Omelet (6 egg whites, 3 tablespoons salsa, 1 tbsp flaxseed oil) with coffee or tea... not my thing."
2,What Has Happened to My Favorite Author?,"This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book. What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me? These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines. I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales. I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies. Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do."
2,Weak in the Middle,"The two parts of the central rod are joined via a threadded section and is the weakest link to this product. Next time I will buy a rotisserie kit with a single central rod. The handle broke on the first use and the securing stakes are flimsy. I would not buy this again unless I was only cooking small foods, ie. less than family sized chicken."
5,A Very Helpful Aid,"For anyone wanting to learn how to add water to their yard, this is the book to get. I loved it because the projects are easy to follow and there aren't any steps that you will not be able to do.The information at the front of the book lays out a good foundation for the projects that you will find throughout the book. From everything such as designing, planning and the tools you will need, to maintenance and the many projects; this book will lead the path to having the calming effect of water in your yard.The illustrations and photography just add to how helpful and very informative this book really is. This book would make a great gift for any gardener."
3,Ho hum,"This a basic slim book that does just what the writers promise. They show the novice gardener how to make 16 water features. There are assorted fountains, including a romantic fountain, bell fountain, perpetual water tap, a cascade and a glass waterfall. There is a still pond, a wall waterspout a cascade and a natural pond. It's fairly standard stuff but there are, after all, only so many ways to present simple how-to-do-it water feature information.There are useful sections on tools, materials and pumps, and you'll find plenty of illustrations, including cross-sections of the construction project.There is no bibliography, just a reading list that is really tacky because it only lists other books published by the same publisher. Unless you're new to gardening I'd stay away from books published by Storey. There is nothing basically wrong with them, but they lack the depth, originality and insight that the more experienced gardener generally seeks."
2,Save Your Money,"Looks like a nice set. A book, DVD and a pretty case. BUT, this DVD is mostly a bunch of shrinks telling us what we already know about Michael Jackson's childhood and adult behavior. Looks like it was produced before his death, but a narrator is thrown in talking about him in the past tense with grieving fans thrown in at the end. There is intersting footage of Michael meeting Princess Diana, Elizabeth Taylor supporting him for going into rehab, and LaToya throwing in comments about her brother and father.The book is 120 black & white pages with Michael and family photos added."
5,Good deal!,"Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 30)I just received mine last night. Boy are they yummy! They tend to be a bit hotter then the ones I get from the store, I think it's because they are very fresh. Mine do not expire for about 7 months! I am very happy that I can grab a bag at any time I choose and I save some money on the side! Well worth the 22$ if u like these fries."
1,stale,"The product was old and tasted like it had been in the warehouse for days, we could not eat them."
2,A Beautiful Alex Gray Cover...,"There are probably some really weird ""true"" things in here. This book is what happens when your brain chemistry is pure LSD and you don't have a very rational approach or strong grip on ""average reality"" to begin with. It was a fun book however...and I'm sure the author is a blast to hang out with."
2,BITER!!,"What a terrible attempt to bite Bertice Berry's book!! These were not nearly as funny as Bertice's! Gimme a break guys, better yet get some ideas of your own. I would have never published this after Bertice did her thing(even if you thought of this idea before she did). She beat you to it!"
5,This book was hella funny kid!,"I'm a half-Filipino-half-American from south-west Missouri,which is the most culturally mixed-up situation imaginable. When I read this book, it was like reading my biography. For example, I have those little condiments from fast-food restaurants in my refrigerator. I would rather play Sega than go to work, and I read this book then put it back on the shelf. I bought it later on. This book is written proof that everyone has a little ghetto in them. I give this book two blunts up,,, I mean thumbs up!"
5,"Good product, slow shipping","The candles are good sized, the color combination perfect. The price is right. The shipping was a bit slower that I have grown accustomed to by Amazon's retailers, but not enough to complain about. Just so you know: If you need the candles and hope to use them in some work corresponding with the full moon, order much ahead of time."
4,I like it,"I love all the colors, very useful when casting spells. As well as them being very small, since I don't have candle holders, I used shot glasses"
2,The item description is misleading...,"The product is good but the item description is very misleading. It states that it will be 1 pound worth of it but in fact it's only 3oz that is shipped to you.I contacted Amazon regarding this order and they just shipped me the same thing again. It's not really their fault, I guess, for not knowing. But they need to revise the item description. The price is not good but considering that I got a lot of deals from Amazon, they are still a good place to shop. Just not for this item.BUYER BEWARE. This is not 1 pound worth of thermal grease. You can buy this for about a dollar an oz locally compared to over double here."
2,My rite-up's is law to a mafia movie freak,"( DaviD 1930's MOBSTER)...... This movie is based on the year 1935, The Dutchman's last year of life. It doesn't paint the real picture of the Dutchman or his orginazation. ( Dutch Schultz was a ruthless hot head who didn't entertain a thing. Billy Bathgate was supposed to be Dutch's Protege but was merly an errand boy (No gun play at all). There was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily operations which was still going on in 1935. There was a apperance by Lucky Luciano which was good but nothing shown of the Commission which Dutch was a part of. The best Dutch Schultz I have seen on Film is (HOODLUM). If your like me and want the real 1930's & 40's minus the watered down or mis leading facts, D your homework before you buy or rent. Or read the review and look for David 1930's mobster)."
1,coocoo,"These two must be insane. Neither Hillary nor Condi is electable, even at a primary level. There are half a dozen other candidates on either side who would be better than these two jokers. I have pity on anyone who would actually take Morris or anything in this book seriously."
1,TX7U Temperature Sensor,I could not get this product to work with the La Crosse WS-8035U-IT Wireless 915mhz Forecast Station as it was advertised to do. After several hours of trying to get it to work I finally gave up in frustration. Had I known that this would be the case I would never have purchased either item.
1,La Crosse temp sensor,sent a unit that reads in Celsius vs Fahrenheit and they would not change it. never do business with them again.
2,Works But!! Celsius not Fahrenheit,"I wanted to replace an older sensor that seemed to be malfunctioning after several years, I purchased2 2 sensors. Now I have 1 outside and 2 inside for each level of my house,Unfortunately the new sensors read in Celsius. No luck finding help in the manual or online. I have been waiting 2 weeks for technical support to respond to 2 different requests for assistance.Just received a response from La Crosse. These sensors do not have the ability to be changed to Fahrenheit. If you want Fahrenheit you better check before you buy. The picture on the site shows 50 degrees and 40% humidity. I assumed it was Fahrenheit because 50 degrees Celsius is 122 Fahrenheit!!!!"
2,Celsius only,There is no option to switch from celsius to fahrenheit. My La Crosse WS-450 receiver didn't recognize this sensor after going through both manuals to program additional sensors.
2,Cautiously optimistic,We had to replace this outdoor sensor after a year. It could have been defective or perhaps some rain got into it somehow. I emailed La Crosse and they said the problems were with people using poor quality or dead batteries. This was not the case with ours. I replaced the original monitor with 3 different battery sets and all were new and tested fine on our battery tester. I could not get it to reset or work again. I think the problem is with the seals or lack of them and they get moisture in them that shorts them out. We'll see what happens to this new one.
2,Poor substitute,"Disappointingly not as good as the discontinued TX4U, and at a higher price. Probably adequate for indoor use, where the display might also be useful. The outdoor mounting does not give enough thermal isolation from the structure to which it is attached. The idea is to measure air temperature, not wall temperature. Over priced and under designed."
1,"Beware, Only displays in celcius",Bought 2 of these to replace old ones that no longer worked. When they came and I installed batteries they had the F and C icons showing but when they started to display the temperature in a few seconds they only show celcius. La Crosse tech support tells me you cant change them to fahrenheit even though the old ones where fahrenheit and these are exact part number as the old ones. Telling me the temp in celcius of my remote locations that I want to monitor is usless and I will not buy La Crosse products again.
1,Wrong unit,"Wrong unit sent and have lost receipt. Ole well, some days diamonds and some days coal, With the correct manual I got the unit I was replacing to work properly."
3,"works fine, no complaints, except...","The manual for the base states you have to put the batteries in it first, and the manual for the extra remote I bought states the opposite. When I called for assistance, a message said the would call me back. They did, 2 or 3 weeks later."
4,Great Upgrade,"Simple replacement / upgrade for the obsolete TX4U. Just make sure no water will run on it, it does not have the rain shield."
4,Lovely,"Consider this an art house game. Gamplay is definitely below average, but everything else going on, especially the abstract, distirbingly beautiful story and panic-inducing string-based musical score truly makes this worth one trip through."
1,too small,"We purchased this earrings for our teenage daughter based on the measurements listed on the specifications section. To our surprise the earrings were much smaller, maybe for a little girl. We purchased SecureHoop earrings before with the same measurements and are very happy with the size and quality. But in this instance we had to return them for a refund minus shipping charges. Even after we pointed out the incorrect specifications."
4,Some helpful principles for your life...,"I tend to like self-improvement titles, as picking up one or two good ideas you can implement in your life can make a world of difference. To that end, I picked up a copy of The Present by Spencer Johnson. Johnson, the author of another book I really liked, Who Moved My Cheese?, tells a parable about a young man who is mentored by an older gentleman. The gentleman tells the man about ""the present"", and he does all he can to figure out what exactly that means. He finally realizes the ""present"" is not a physical gift, but a concept involving being totally involved in whatever you are currently doing. By learning how to learn from the past and prepare from the future, you can be much happier and productive in the present.Definitely some interesting concepts, and ones that I can easily see myself working to implement in my own life."
1,THE PRESENT,THE PRESENT is present now!But is to knew almost of all-men.It is a very little to learn from the book.
5,Repaired my problem,"I have a Honda civic 1995, the speedometer and odometer did not work when I bought it about year and a half ago. Mechanic tried to fix it about a year ago but couldn't, he said it might be the transmission so I did not want to mess with that since transmission anything is expensive. Just recently I searched again on the net for troubleshooting odometer and speedometer and found that sometimes is the Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS). Found it on Amazon for about $22, received it today and installed it. It did fix the problem. The best part is that I saved a lot of money since I did the work my self and in other sites or if you buy the sensor form the dealer, the part for this model and year ranges from $40 to $80. It was easy to locate, it actually sits on top of the transmission. You only need a 10mm socket and and wrench. I do recommend this product 100%. Good Luck!Definately recommend this product."
1,Burned.,I purchased this item on my mechanics request. After I received it he said it was not compatible with my car. I then proceeded to return the item on my expence wich was not a problem. Only thing is that I never got my money back I NEVER got credit or anything I fill ripped off it's sad because I have been a loyal customer to Amazon. Every time I purchase something they charge it right away if a payment does not go thru for any reason they email me constantly. But when it ce time to get my money back for this item I never got an email nor the attemp to reach me was made.
5,Flash Drive works as advertised,I have two of these flash drives that are being used for backup and transporting data between computers. They work well for my purposes.
3,Almost loved it,I bought this specific USB drive because of the compact size and the security features. Over all performing well. Under Vista the secured partition cannot be used :-((. Checked for updates but none yet. The little plastic hook on the top broke off within days so now I can only carry it in my pocket.
1,Sent it back,"Too loud, even when off! THen it had glitches in dvd recording. Sent it back and Amazon was great and paid for the return shipping!!!"
5,These bulbs are better my original PIAA bulbs!,"I bought these bulbs to replace the bulbs that came in my PIAA 5296 530 Clear ATP aftermarket lights. The original bulbs did not last very long at all and were much more expensive. These KC bulbs are much brighter, much cheaper and they are still burning bright in July of 2012 - which is more than I can say for the PIAA bulbs. I would definitely buy these again (if I ever have to!)"
3,Brightest KC makes but...,"This is KC's replacement for their 385K candlepower sealed beam. This bulb, combined with their 4213, long range reflector, is a fair replacement for the sealed beam they no longer make. I'm not unhappy with it but it's surely not a true replacement for the older bulb."
2,Abridged!,"I could find no warning saying that this product is abridged. That is not to say it is not useful, but it is to say that it is not as good as the original. I compared my hard copy with the digital edition, and found that lots of information is lost. I contacted OSNOVA about this issue, and they have not contacted me back. After I realized they would not contact me back, I decided to warn other customers. Too bad, I wish the real Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown were available for kindle."
3,"Jamieson, Fausset & Brown's Bible Commentary","A good price. Haven't have a chance to read it much, but seems like a nice book. Naturally, more condensed than a set of commentaries would be, but still very helpful in my studies. Would recommend."
5,Funk Masterpiece,"Unknown (practically) funk masterpiece -- great songwriting and the band stretches out on ""Vine City"" and ""Messin Around."" (around 9 min. ea.) Brass and strings arrangements are intelligent and tasteful, nothing overdone here. Just a good funky groove when players could play. It's hip."
4,"Quit yer whining, Kurtz fans!","I discovered the Deryni novels in the early 80's and eagerly await each one as it is published. I, too, was first attracted to Knights of the Blood on the strength of Katherine Kurtz' name, but immediately noticed that she was credited only as co-creator. I agree that Scott MacMillan's writing is not up to par with his wife's, but that isn't to say that the story is not engaging. I have enjoyed the books, although a globe-trotting millionaire homicide detective on the trail of Nazi vampires can seem a bit much sometimes, especially with his spur-of-the-moment sexual encounter. All-in-all, though, the books are extremely readable and enjoyable, and I have been waiting for book #3 for several years now, along with the next Deryni book. Are the MacMillans listening?"
1,A disappointment all around,"A major disappointment for Kurtz fans, this book shows none of her excellent characterizations. Unlike her Deryni series, none of these characters inspire a feeling that you want to know these people better. Not James Drummond, the protagonist, who apparently gives up his charmed, bachelor life working for the LAPD. Not the order of crusading knights who somehow felt that the desecration of the Grail Shrine in the Holy Land by vampiric Saracens could be cleansed by nailing the lead vampire to the shrine wall and drinking his blood using the cup of Christ. All in all, the work was clearly a lesson in writing for MacMillan, who got his characterizations down better by the book's end. But it's scarcely worth the read for Kurtz fans"
3,Kaboom!,"If one was to ever speak about kiddy bubble gum rap / hip-hop, Kris Kross would be of those mentioned. Their sophomore release Da Bomb detonated a little too soon to get a more critically acclaimed LP. The title track featured the newcomer Da Brat for a strong performance. Retaliating on lashes from others, ""Alright"" featuring Super Cat states they're cool on battling or whatever. Hard kicks and guitar licks added an edge for this album on ""I'm Real"". Kris Kross their formula to flowing to Jermaine Dupri's tracks on ""Freak Da Funk"". Though we know Jermaine Dupri entirely wrote and produced the entire album, Mac Daddy began writing his own lyrics on three of the songs. It's a step away from their first album but there was a lack of originality that kept it from gaining a serious acknowledgement."
5,Long Live Buzzy,"My friends and I grew up listening to Edgar and Johnny Winter, Little Feat and Springsteen. Than my older brother turned us on to Buzzy! ""PussyCats Can Go Far"" will live forever! We are all waiting for the day that Buzzy's work will be re-released. I have recently found a Buzzy Web site and hope that his good health returns. I want to thank Amazon for their part in keeping his work ""alive"" and for the customers that shared their memories."
2,Not a Very User-Friendly Book,"Although I already despised my inorganic chemistry course, I have not found this book very helpful. It is written in hard to follow language, has very long blocks of text, and not enough diagrams, pictures, or explanations for being a course textbook. Plus, it only has a few, select, answers to the problem questions included in the text."
2,"Not a 7 miler, not a 3 miler, maybe not 2 miles...","Disappointing, thats about all I can say. I wasn't expecting to get the claimed 7 miles on land (who knows, it may get 5-7 on the water), but I have trouble just getting 1 mile on the land. Seems a small hill can even ruin the range. When I do get through the sound is clear, little to no squaks or breaks, and the privacy channels work well. Vibrating alert is very nice. It's just so very lacking in the range. I even took the time to register with the FDA so I could use the GMRS range legaly. Oh well."
2,Nice features. Range doesn't live up to claim.,"Love the features, but the range is not as advertised. In my test I used channel 22 on high power. 1/2 mile was about the best it could do. I bought to use playing paintball, so it should be okay for that, but I was also hoping to use it at places like large malls and theme parks to coordinate with the wife in kids. Oh well."
4,Used Book,I was very pleased with the amount of contact I recieved from the seller. The condition of the book I ordered was exactly in the same condition as was listed on the site. The book took about two weeks to finally arrive. My only complaint would be having to wait so long to recieve my order in the mail.
4,"Elegiac, Psychological Thriller","This novel is hard to putdown and hard to label easily. It is about an assassin who isn't really an assassin. He may be British, but we don't really know. Older gentleman but of indeterminate age. There is someone out to get him but he is a mystery too. Martin Booth has written a unique study of the inner mind of someone who is out of their element geographically as well as out of human contact personally and professionally. What is it like to live when you cannot trust anyone? Similar novelistic qualities to Georges Simenon and John Le Carre without the fast-paced plotting and tidy finish. I found myself wanting to read more and I was disappointed when it was over. Very good-- but not nearly as good as ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy."" A stand out contribution to the thriller canon, nevertheless."
4,A Very Private Gentleman,"I wanted to read this novel to see how close the movie version was to the written word. However, I was disappointed to learn that the author had died. The novel is very well written and I enjoyed it very much."
2,I Wanted to Like This Book,"I wanted to like this book, but it just doesn't go anywhere. I don't want to always read a thriller where there is action on every page, but this book rarely has action and the narrative is dull."
2,No book for old Men,The book is written in the most beautiful prose with exemplary descriptions of the Italian country side.It tends to wander aimlessly on and on.One does not have a feeling of this being a thriller/crime story at all.There is no feeling of suspense or urgency in the first 1/3 of the book and I still do not know what the man does!!Hope the movie is better.
5,Bartending Inside Out,"Finally a book for the professional bartender. It gives you the insight on what you really need to be professional bartender. Unlike most books that give you a 1000 recipes and teach you what cups to use, this book is truely designed to help those who wish to make a living bartending. A must read for those considering becoming a mixologist for a career or to supplement their income."
3,Pobre Charly,"Este CD es una muestra de la caída de Charly, del derrumbe de un verdadero ídolo.La interpretación de prácticamente todas las canciones da lástima. Charly ya no tiene voz, se olvida de las letras -- físicamente estuvo en ese sitio, pero su mente definitivamente andaba por otro planeta.Si eres amante de Charly, te recomiendo que lo compres, pero solo para que veas la diferencia entre estas versiones y las originales.Si no conoces a Charly, mejor busca una recopilación..."
4,Great new book from Diane Irons!,"Diane Irons has finally come out with her new book, Age Defying Beauty Secrets. This book is filled with thousands of tips and tricks to help you look beautiful, young, and at your best. The main focus of this book is to give you simple, easy-to-follow secrets, tips, and tricks for looking and feeling younger.You'll get tips on fashion, beauty, diet, nutrition, and even secrets of Hollywood's biggest models and stars. As another reviewer commented, many of these tips are found in fashion magazines, but there are also many new ones and it is very nice to have them all in one place. The best part is that they really work!! An excellent book and I would definitely recommend it to anybody."
4,GLADYS ALONE,"Gladys without The Pips, still at Buddah Records, 1978... This album contains some pearls that hardly are remembered. The aching performance of Gladys for ""We don't need each other laugh anymore"", a song entirely different from the style we were used to hear from Gladys, the delightfull ""Sail Away/Freedom For The Stallions"", the potential hit ""I'm Still Caught Up With You"", the vigorous and wonderful Gladys'performance to ""I'm Coming Home Again"". Only for these tracks the record is already worthy. But it has too a good song called ""The Way It Was"" composed by B.Gibb, R.Gibb and Blue Weaver (Bee Gees?), and another two good ones, ""I'll Take a Melody"" and ""With You In My Mind""! We don't miss The Pips in this album, maybe because of the chosen songs. Gladys seems to show that she can walk alone."
1,Must be a born again christian to enjoy this novel,"While the new description here on Amazon now shows a reference to the main character having recently found Christ - I was not exposed to this info when I picked up the book. The books own back cover and front cover give no inkling that this book is intended as a Religious - Born Again Christian - type novel. I was sincerely not ready for the opening page of the prologue to have the main characters discussing getting baptized, nor was I prepared for them to keep invoking the name of God in the course of the story. You MUST be a born again Christian to enjoy this book. I am not. It is not my cuppa tea at all. Couldn't get past the religion to find the story. I had to put it down without finishing it."
4,validating and reassuring,"After having experienced the death of my premature baby at 22 weeks, I searched for information and help with sorting out my feelings and understanding why this happened and what can I possibly do now...overall I found this book the most helpful and comforting in that way. I highly recommend it to others who experience these kinds of tragedies in their lives..."
4,Ready to try again,"I thought the information it this book was very well organized and laid out in an easy to find manner. I was surprised at all the things that can go wrong during a pregnancy, but found it reassuring that many of the women who offered testimonials went on to have healthy children. I plan to share the book with my sister who also recently had a baby who was stillborn. I hope that it will help give her hope as it has helped me. It has only been a few weeks since my own daughter was stillborn but knowing that others have survived this tragedy helps me know that I can survive, too.I especially enjoyed the section about how people felt when their subsequent children were born. I plan to try again very soon, and I want my boys to know that they did have a baby sister, even if it was for just a little while, and that they may still have another little sister soon. Or a brother, that would be wonderful, too!"
1,float sticks. inaccurate,"I purchased this product at a LFS 100 miles from home, and the little needle that floats conveniently gets stuck when I fill the hydrometer with water. The coralife ""deep 6"" hydrometer I borrowed from a friend is quite accurate and puts this instant ocean product to shame.Boo."
3,Asks Some Important Questions,"Thouhg there are many points that will cause controversy and some that are not quite as thought through as they should be, this book raises some important questions about the role of IT that need to be examined, especially in the context of the highly polarized arguments that have recently erupted about the subject."
2,Just Drags,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book ""Dies the Fire"" it maintained a good pace.This book however, just drags on. Almost the entire book is devoted to life on the farm, with little or no action. While some of it is interesting, it does start to get real monotonous completely unlike the first book.I found myself browsing through these parts and then reading when it got interesting, needless to say I browsed almost the entire book, 75% anyway. There is just way to much filler. The songs do not really add to the book.As mentioned earlier the first book was very good, this one was a sleeper. Had I not bought the third book ""A Meeting at Corvallis"", I would have packed this one in at page 50.This book really does nothing more than introduce some new characters, there is little or nothing else."
1,The Protectors Bore,"While I enjoyed most of Dies the Fire, by the end I was very annoyed with the Juniper character, and found myself skipping over the (boring) details of her wiccan prayers and outlook. I had hopes for The Protectors War, and unfortunately it's worse than it's predecessor. McKenzie and her group get far too much play, and come across as self righteous religious fanatics. The reader is dragged thru endless truly horrible chants and poems, as these people seem to have to invoke their deities with laughably stilted invocations for every thing from brushing their teeth to going into battle. I found myself skipping large chunks of this book, and the editing- switching from linear narrative to flashback in midstream- didn't help matters any. There is too much exposition, and not enough action. All in all, a boring disapointment. The third book in the series is out in hardcover, but I won't even be checking it out of the library."
3,Not Bad but Jeez enough already we get it!!,"Ok here is the deal, this is a pretty good series (The first book being Dies the Fire) but my lord every time we get to Junipers story all we get are a series of minstral songs and about 50 pages of ""Blessed be"" and wiccan blah blah blah.WE get it she is a witch ooooh aaaaah but man does the author really need to remind us every 5th word?The storyline involving The Bearkillers is entertaining though and I realise that its a book but are we really suppose to believe that within 6 moths of the Change happening a large portion of humanity would become cannables? and the loss of electricity and gunpowder would lead to the death of tens of millions...dont think so.I gave it 3 stars becasuse it is an intresting idea and half of the book is pretty fun but my advice is to just skim the Juniper, Clan Mackenzie storyline there really is very little of intrest there."
5,A real doll!,This doll is very lifelike. I gave one to my elderly mother because she loves babies so much and is not able to babysit any longer. This was a very special gift for her.
5,Charly Quintaesencial,"Claramente una obra esencial dentro del repertorio de Charly Garcia y quiza uno de sus mejores trabajos junto a los monumentales Piano Bar, Yendo de la Cama al Living y Filosofia Barata. Repleto de hits natos, no tiene cancion mala, sinembargo destacan el contestatario No Toquen, el charlyesque No Me Veras en el Subte y sobre todo la sublime trilogia Ella es Bailarina, Anhedonia y Suicida (diez minutos de musica energetica pero profunda, veloz e indispensable sobre todo en aquellos momentos en que estamos a punto de rendirnos si batallamos, detenernos si corremos o jalar el gatillo y destaparnos los sesos, como dice Sabina, cuando el espejo de la vida nos escupe la verdad a la cara). En Como Conseguir Chicas, Charly habla con el bajo, canta con el piano y crea un disco solido, completo, deseperado, profundo pero sobre todo clasico: ""somos estatuas de sal queremos volver... sho sha no miro atras... sha no tengo mucho mas..."
5,Entertaining,"Sometimes you just want a movie to entertain, not one that you really have to think about. This is a good one, at least for me."
4,"One of my ""watch it any time"" favorites",I love this movie. It's a good mix of blow it up and funny. Good one liners and a decent plot.
2,Not what I expected.,I found the book way too wordy with not much practical help. I found Mastering Swimming and Swim Smooth much more helpful and the diagrams and pictures in both excellent.
4,could be shorter,"I noticed a huge improvement after reading this book and applying it's principles. It's effective. It's not revolutionary, but I swim faster now than I have from any other book. The author describes the techniques in depth and in ways that made sense to me.The entire book, however, could have been done in 50 pages. The author goes on for pages explaining why he's about to teach you something. I kept waiting for what it was he was preparing me to learn and didn't ever really get there. I felt like I was supposed to buy something after a while. There was so much that was just padding. For example, I didn't enjoy going through four pages of similarities between swimming and tennis. The book is a little overly dramatic also. Another example is an excerpt from the book listing reasons for drills: ""Fact: Your Muscles Need a Dose of Amnesia"". That's hardly a fact, it's theatrical.In short, the book is quite helpful, but not well written."
4,Total Immersion: A new way to swim,"This is a fun, cleverly written instruction /training manual for the everyday swimmer. I am a competitive masters swimmer and I found many of the drills useful to me as positive reenforcement for the way I train and think. Swimming should be enjoyable as well as invigorating, and swimming the TI way is both. The basis of training the mind so the body works efficiently is not a new concept, but the author brings these basics to a different concept for the aquatic enthusiast, whether novice or traditionally trained. Practice and learn the TI way of swimming and you may never go back to the old traditional ways."
3,"Good ideas, not a good writer","If the author had spent less time praising his technique and criticizing other forms of exercize, I think that the incredible lessons taught in the book could have been made a lot more powerful. As it is, though, you have to suffer through a lot of unnecessary boastful rhetoric and an equal amount of runner and biker bashing in order to finally get the message.Read the book, but beware the author."
4,Pipe Dreams,"Soundtrack of the homonymous movie, ""Pipe Dreams"" is the record of ""So Sad The Song"", always present in the numberless collections released with such names as ""Greatest Hits"", ""The Best of"", etc. etc. But it has more! It has the powerful and wonderful performance of Gladys to ""Pipe Dream"", it has the captivating ""Follow My Dream"" ( composed by Rev. J. Cleveland), the clammy ""Nobody But You"" (you wish to sing together, kind of, ""everybody: nobooody but youuuu, nobooody but yoooou...) and a delightfull instrumental tune, called ""Pot Of Jazz"", where Gladys & The Pips sing along just things like ""pa pa pa pa tchou rou rou..."" and you else wish to clap your hands and sing together with them. A brilliant work of Buddah times!"
1,My ELF dvd didn't work either!,"I LOVE all three movies, but that doesn't really matter if the disc doesn't play the movie when you go to watch it! I see that another buyer had the same problem with the ELF dvd not working. Buyer beware, even if it isn't Christmas time when you buy this combo pack, test that all 3 play, or you will be as disappointed as I am with defective merchandise in a cute package."
2,What about Bob?,Delivery of this item was excellent. The DVDworked perfectly. I like this movie betternow the second time I watched it.
4,The Shadow Knows,"The shadow on the CD cover pretty well sums it up. Maybe a better title would have been ""Kill Bob Lots of Times"".A total side splitter from the get go. Fun to watch many times. Hats off to Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss."
4,Made this therapist laugh,"Pretty funny. Especially if you are a therapist like I am. Bill Murray would be your worse case scenario while on vacation, Funny as always in his droll manner and Richard Dreyfuss gives laughs as he slowly unravels."
5,This movie is a riot!,"This is a funny movie. Great acting. There is alot to be said for the ""soundness"" of the therapy! Worth the watch!"
2,This could have been a much better movie,"With well over 100 reviews written for this movie, a plot review is probably not needed here. The reason that I couldn't enjoy this movie very much was that I had too much sympathy for the Richard Dreyfus character. Most of the time ""Bob"" was annoying to me. It was difficult to see why Dreyfus was the only one that was bothered by him. Nothing about Bob's personality that endeared him to the doctor's family was made evident. I think that most kids would have found him goofy, weird, etc., and would have avoided him at all costs.I think that Bill Murray's protrayal of Bob was too ""broad."" If his actions would have been more subtle (without taking away his ""fear of everything"") he could have seemed more normal to others while still driving Richard Dreyfus crazy."
3,GOOD MOVIE,I LOVE BILL MURRAY AND THAT IS WHY I ENJOY THIS FILM A LOT. CRAZY BILL ALONG WITH HIS FISH HAS A LOT TO MAKE YOU THINK. IS A FUNNY MOVIE FOR ALL THE FAMILY TO SIT AND WATCH.
5,Laugh and Laugh and Laugh Some More!,"Priceless comedic entertainment. Bill Murray is a master at this kind of role, combining everything from facial contortions, eye movements, physical agility and dialogue to create the epitome of pure neurosis in a disturbed but extremely lovable guy. Each character brings a different slant to the laughs in the film, but Dr. Leo Marvin is by far the greatest Abbott to Wiley's Costello. This is easily one of the funniest movies of all time, right up there with Blazing Saddles and Animal House. Best of all, we learn a lesson that not everything is taught by professionals, i.e. Bob teaching the fearful son to swim. Best line: ""I'll be quiet,"" and ""I'll be peace!"""
5,A Real knock-out,"I mean, there have been a number of movies dealing with neuroses of the today average working people living in any major city, some of them beautifully directed by Woody Allen, but Murray as Bob Wiley submits a much more credible version of it by being so refreshingly un-intellectual. Nevertheless he is so clever to drive a well-educated scholar like Dr Marvin totally nuts. It is remarkable that there is so much subtility that one often discovers oneself in both characters...Best entertainment"
5,MUST SEE FOR ALL!,What About Bob ? is literally the best movie that has ever been made. It is a comedic phenomenon of outrageous proportion. Bill Murray is the one and only person to play Bob Wiley. If you haven't seen it -- you are missing something.
4,"Great Movie, Disappointing DVD","As ""What About Bob"" is one of my favorite films of all time, I was excited that it finally was released on DVD. But what I wasn't expecting was how little there is on the DVD besides the actual movie. Maybe I'm spoiled by added features on movies like ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" documentaries, or my funny commentary tracks as in ""Two Weeks Notice"" with Hugh Grant and Sandy Bullock. But I really was hoping to see an option on this DVD to have Bill Murray give commentary. *sigh*"
4,Murray Always Good At Being Wacky,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it, laughing most of the way. By the second look, Bill Murray's deliberately obnoxious-pushy character now started driving me crazy, too. No longer was it just Richard Dreyfuss being tormented.Murray, (""Bob""), is so annoying, so irritating, that you either laugh or want to kill this guy yourself as he hounds his psychiatrist all over the place. Kudos to Dreyfuss to put up with, even if it's just acting. Murray certainly did his job well in this film. He was the perfect actor to play ""Bob.""In fairness, Murray was so at this sort of thing that he could still be endearing, even when you wanted to strangle him! This is one reason he's been so popular over the years.Highly recommended, but beware ""Bob"" may drive you nuts, too."
2,Too small,"Please order a size larger than you usually wear. Even the XL was too small, so I had to return it. As it happens the green I ordered was not a teal, as it had appeared on my screen, but more of a leaf green."
1,Buy from Dragon's Goodies at your own risk,"Dragon's Goodies sold me a visably and functionally defective software disc, then refused to issue a refund. Buyer beware."
4,Great aid for post hip surgery,My mother-in-law had a reacher very much like this at the nursing facility where she stayed after her hip surgery. When she got home she requested one for at home. It is great in picking items off the floor if something drops (she states she was even able to pick up a large pill) and can also be used as a dressing aid. This is not as sturdy as the one she had a the facility but works well and has been durable.
2,Works OK,"The grasping mechanism for this device works well enough for the purpose I purchased it for - I'm short and need to be able to reach items in my upper cabinets. However, I decided on this particular product because of the magnetic tip, which, unfortunately, simply does not work. The ""magnet"" is very small - about the diameter of a pencil eraser - and the one on the item I received has absolutely no magnetic properties at all - objects as light as a paper clip won't even adhere to it. Had I known this, I would have purchased a different model."
1,Poorly constructed. Useless.,I've used these reachers in the past and they were great. These are awful. All three are strung too tight. The jaws will not touch so forget being able to pick up anything under a half an inch thick. With one the magnet fell off immediately with another the yellow jaw has fallen out twice. Save your money and skip these.
2,Not very sturdy,I expected better quality than I received. I should have checked out the reviews. The hand grip is too wide for a medium-sized woman. The construction is poor.
4,stillwatch,"very enjoyable book,i could not put it down.i just wanted to turn to the next page to see what was happening."
3,Fair to middlin',"I was surprised to find the ""occult"" as well as ""accepted adultery"" in this Clark novel. It was not as captivating as most of her novels. It did have a surprising ending."
1,Full of Typos!,The real book was fantastic. This ebook version is so full of typos it's hard to get through. I'm very surprised the author didn't have someone read this version before approving it.
5,Great Fantasy Book,"I recently purchased the Wilderness of Four Series, and found them to be delightful. If you like fantasy stories that involve a full range of charaters and creatures, with a mix of magic and lost history, then you love the books by Niel Hancock. I hope to soon see the new book ""The Brandigore Gate"", in bookstores soon!"
4,Great book for your bookclub,"The host for the bookclub I'm in, choose this book as our 'read' for last month. We all enjoyed it, but for different reasons. I enjoyed reading about the information about his mother that Mr. Lovett was presented with & were it came from. My friend Pat has been inspired to search out information about her birth mother. Not to only find out what her birth mother was like, but to get health records & etc. We all were impressed that this very touching book was written by a man. How wonderful to read something this sensitive that is written by the gender whom usually prides themselves to be 'tough as nails'. We all agree that sensitive men are the best! We all live in a small town (Kernersville) that is located about 10 miles from Winston-Salem. We are planning to go see if we can find the house that he grew up in next time we are in W-S. Authors can have 'groupies' too!"
1,reeks,"Another good rock band killed by a lame ballad (hello, The Reason). In short, let me sum up my review of their newest album in three simple words:it totally blows."
2,How can anybody say they like this album and truly mean it??,After listening to this cd I must say i was definetly dissapointed. Every song pretty much sounds like The Reason in terms of tempo and vocals with different words and tune. Now im not saying The Reason is a bad song but i've heard it so many times im sick of it and honestly i didnt expect them to sink so low as to make altered copys of their most successfull song to make alother hit record. Of the 13 tracks on the cd there are maybe 3 or 4 good songs which still aren't up to par with what i expected from hoobastank which is the only reason im giving it 2 stars rather then 1.
2,overrated really,"i know a lot of people who are really excited for this show to finally come out on dvd. i myself, just never bound the ""brilliance"" in it. it had its moments here and there ill admit, but for the most part, i just couldnt find this show funny. was overrated(just like Everybody Loves Raymond) its sad when a show like this, or Friends can last so long, but a brilliant show like The Tick only lasts half a season. oh well, just one mans rant."
1,Sent wrong Item,"We spoke with their representative who told us the radios we were purchasing were compatable with our Motorola XTN series radios. Upon receipt we saw they were not compatable, and requested them to exchange them for ones that were. To date they have ignored our request. I would not purchase or recommend this company at this time."
4,Enjoyed this book,This book gave lots of helpful information to help with rebellious teenagers and kids. Tips for teaching them in a way to ensure they understand.
3,Good book,"The first couple of books in this series were the best. I am only reading the rest of the series because I wanted to see how it ends. However, most of the remaining books seem to be basically telling the same story as the first book over and over."
1,The Worst,"This book was a pointless 7th book to an otherwise excellent 6 book series. There are some times when giving an audience what they want is a bad idea, and giving his readers more of his Phaze and Proton characters was a bad idea for Piers Anthony. In general, the rest of the books make a good read with somewhat original storylines and some interesting twists and turns. This book is so awful, I'm ashamed to even admit I read it. Take my advice and leave off with book six, it makes a good end to a decent Anthony series."
1,"yeah, what the other guy said.","i wound up hearing the song ""dangerous leaving your front door"", and i thought okay, cool band. but i couldn't quite place what sounded so familur about them, then i was strangely tempted to listen to blink 182. and it hit. these guys are nothing but jack sh$t rip off wanna bees. being inspired is fine. but uh looking at someone else, and seeing that as an opratunity to make it, no matter what intensions, you suck!!!!!! forget underoath. and gee that reminds me, what is up with all these little gay teenie boppers coming out with records that are peices of crud lately? i just don't get it. oh yeah that reminds me, one last, thing. death to coheed and exist. peace!! find some real music!! right on! rock on! rock and roll is being destoyed, but at least there are few and far between that still at least can be soothful. find them, find them now!!!"
3,Underoath Theyre only chasing safety,"If youre a beginning listener to underoath,take consideration that they just got a new singer.And i think to really appreciate underoath you have to hear them when dallas was around.No doubt the new cd is good,but its just not underoath without dallas.The music has changed sooo much over the years,it has gone more to the screamo side of things,which in these days is inevitable.Im not against the new style of things i just think before you make a real opinion on underoath you should buy the other cds as well."
4,its good,"this CD is pretty....i kinda dig the older UnderOATH better with the other singer......the new singer is rad, but his scream is kinda high pitched..and i like alittle deeper screams like Alex from Atreyu or Brandon from Bleeding Through...but Spencers scream is still BA....overall its good"
3,underoath,"Well im not saying i dont like this cd, but its not my favorite from them, there old cds were much more heavier and much more better in my opinion. I mean i like some songs but i really dont listen to this cd id rather listen to ACT OF DEPRESSION or THE CHANGING OF TIMES which are there better releases. Get this if you are into the screamo type stuff, if not dont."
1,Waste of money,"What a disappointment. I have old versions of songs off this cd before they decided to rerecord the entire thing. This cd would be a waste of $15 and hours of my time. Maybe you guys should look into old Underoath. Especially all of you ""nerds"" that are in love with the DVD that probably have no clue about the old heavier side of Underoath. You probably wouldn't like it anyway though, because it's not screamo. So nevermind."
2,Pure Mediocrity,"The only word that comes to my mind when hearing this album is ""meh."" This band is extremely overhyped. Granted this band is extremely catchy as a lot of ""emo-core"" out there, they are far from innovative and sound like a majority of the popular hard rock bands that are prevalent today. Some of the guitar riffs are decent yet typical, and the singer has an amazing scream but a singing voice that is comparable to a handicapped person. This cd gets 2 stars instead of 1 because they're a decent band that can improve in many ways. Anyways, the bottom line is if you're looking for a satisfying and catchy album with minimal talent, pick up this cd.. you won't be dissapointed."
5,"What can i say, im in love","ok everybody who is reading this and is skeptical. dont listen to the person below me. they must not know what theyre talking about. Screamo music is made because of extreme passion for the message of the band. In underOATH's case theyre message is Christ. A Christian band can be whatever kind of music they want to be as long as the message is God. nobody should hate on Underoath for screaming and being Christian. i mean, look, how many other bands are out there that are Christian and harder that underOATH? like a million. ex. Mortal Treason, Norma Jean, Zao, Haste the Day, The Chariot, and blessed by a broken heart. c'mon ppl. Music is about emotion, not sound. give underOATH a chance and by this CD. this is best CD in all of the world. no CD can top this until underOATH releases a new album"
3,"I like it, but I don't","I agree with everyone about how talented they use to be and how on the new cd they put all of the attention the screaming/singing. The music itself sounds pretty lame and has no energy to it. I don't think it sounds horrible, it's just such a big change from old underoath. I wouldn't say they sold out that much because I have never seen them on TV or heard anything on the radio before. So, I donno... I just wish they didn't change so much because thier old [...] rocks. All in all, I think most people can get into this because it has more of a ""poppy"" feal to it, but if your into the more harder [...] I wouldn't recommend this CD."
4,An old favorite.,My husband and I have been wating for The Aftican Queen to come to DVD. The Amazon service was great as always. THe DVD is clearer than the old VHS. We especially enjoyed the special features. The story is wonderful and a must for any family movie collection.
5,Commerative Edition The African Queen,The Making of the movie documentary was as good as the movie. Hepburn's book is superb.
4,The African Queen,"This movie is a total classic, and I saw it in the 1950's and now I have it for my own. The only thing, some might think it's a little slow in the the action, compared to our movies now a days, Humphery Bogart and Katharine Hepburn are both great Actors in there own wright, so if you are looking for a love story and adventure down a river, you have it all in this movie."
5,A jewel for the Queen.,African Queen is a jewel. It is always wonderful to watch this exciting classic movie.
4,"Classic Bogie, Classic Kate, Classic Huston!","One of the truly great adventure/romances of all time. The Chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is always fun to watch as they journey down the Congo river on their way to destroying a German battleship whilst getting to know each other then falling in love along the way. Great scenery, great story based on C.S. Forester's novel, and great repartee between the two veteran leads. The last great collaboration between Bogie and John Huston, ""Beat the Devil"" in 1954 being a satirical trifle at best."
5,Classic and beautiful!,"Bogart, Hepburn, Huston, all at the height of their powers. A jungle, and a boat. A perfect romance/action/adventure film, one of the rare greats. Film lovers, if by some chance you've missed this one, correct that error ASAP - you will not regret it."
4,Cool movie,"I watched the African Queen in social studies in 7th grade. It was Ok. I liked the whole idea. I know this will sound stupid but i didnt like the way that Rosie woman smiled.But in general, the movie was OK."
1,We Need a US/North America DVD NOW!!,"It is unconscionable that one of THE Greatest Films of all time is STILL not available on DVD in North America. What in the world is the problem??BTW, for the reviewer who mentioned that Bogey ""didn't sound British""; you need to pay attention--early in the film Bogey's character (Charlie) is clearly identified as CANADIAN. Eh? But of course, during the era depicted (1914) Canada was a Dominion of the British Empire, and still used the ""Union Jack"" as their national flag. (The Canadian ""Red Ensign"" was adopted in late 1943; the ""Maple Leaf flag"" in 1967).Nevertheless--bring us THE AFRICAN QUEEN!! Say ""NO"" to Bootlegs!!"
1,Don't buy this version,"The movie's history speaks for it's self. It belongs in in the collection of every Bogart or Hepburn fan. But the quality of the disc was unplayable. It arrived loose in it's box, all scratched up. Would not play on any machine. Amazon would only refund not replace so I can only assume none of the coppies are any good. I'm waiting for an American release before I try to purchase again."
2,Just another Things to Do Book for New York City,"There are SO many great things to do in New York City with kids that this book should have been a breeze for its authors. The suggestions are all ""OK"". But there is very little that is insightful, and it lacks real excitement and interest.Perhaps its too hard for a print publication to keep current, and readers would be better off going on the web and looking at Time Out New York Kids.I was disappointed."
5,Loved it till it was stolen :(,"This detector was helpful on numerous occasions. The description doesn't list it but, at least for the one I ordered from Amazon, it came with voice alerts. The voice alert is really useful because you don't have to look down to see if it's detecting the common X band (from a pharmacy) or if its laser in which case you know something is awry. If you can get a deal on one, go for it."
2,Not very good,"I enjoyed the original ""Cutting Edge"" quite a bit and so had moderately high hopes for this one. I love a good date movie and am prepared to accept a certain formulaic quality from the genre. But I'm afraid this offering fails to meet the required standard.It's the usual plot: star figure skater needs new partner after his established partner is injured. He plucks an unknown out of nowhere -- they train together, fall in love, have a romantic crisis and end up winning the gold.To make this enjoyable, the lead characters need to have chemistry and the movie needs to make at least some minimal effort to avoid cliches.Unfortunately, almost every line in this script is a cliche -- my wife saw several coming before they were uttered -- and the leads, while attractive don't exactly melt the screen with their passion.Pretty harmless fare -- just not very good."
2,The Cutting Edge-Chasing the Dream,I was led to believe there were seque;s to The Cutting Edge. U was disappointed to find that this was the same movie with added title and different actors... VERY disappointed.
4,Loveable..,"Not your typical fairytale story but enjoyable for the family to watch, I recommend it to everyone and see for yourself.."
5,Absolutely best value for Italian dictionary/reference,"Short take: ordered based on description and previous reviews (2) to use this as support for college-level conversational Italian courses. Absolutely worth the price and then some -- especially compared to the cost of course textbooks at the university book store.Book is not only a full-blown English-Italian/Italian-English dictionary but also contains a center reference section of topcial, conversational-usage phrases."
3,"Weird, but still okay","Adding a little perspective, I am an open-minded believer. Honestly, I found this guy's journey to be a bit more horse-puckey than anything truly enlightening. What about all the other religions? But despite a weird tone overall, I still managed to get through the book. I had a bet with someone that I wouldn't finish it, so I had a real crud-eating grin on my face when I collected!"
2,Traveloque rather than religious study,"To be honest, I was expecting more of an light archeological study rather than a simple traveloque. So I was perhaps disappointed by the lack of depth.It started out sounding a little like some Zionist literature, with the ""maybe its in my DNA?"" and interviews with Israeli settlers in the occupied territories. No discussion of the alternate political views - e.g. why should they be allowed to take land that doesn't belong to them. But this is done without much overt political agenda and is not offensive; just doesn't necessarily fit with the exploration of the Bible.Most of the book wasn't like that though, but was just kind of boring. I took a class in college that reviewed the ""Old Testament"" with the perspective of history and anthropology which was great and I was really expecting something more like that.So probably a good book for some, but not what I was looking forward to."
5,Makes you wish that you had followed the author on his trail,"You're 'carried' along with Mr. Feiler on a journey that inspires your heart and your mind. One of those books that you spend time with, only wishing that you could have shared the time on 'location' with the author. He draws you into his experience in a way that makes you truly feel part of it."
3,Riders In the Sky,"The song ""Ghostriders in the Sky"" from the movie is actually done by a band called Spiderbite. You can find it on the internet!"
3,The song,"Actually, the song ""Lost Highway"" was played at the end of the movie. And, that song will be coming out in June on the new Bon Jovi CD. Killer movie and the soundtrack was fine. But, I agree.....no Lost Highway no complete soundtrack."
3,Missing One Thing...,"...The Title Song!!! I loved the music from the movie, yes the background instrumentals were great...but like everyone else, I wanted the actual song ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" that played through the end credits. I wasn't very happy when the soundtrack didn't have it. In fact, nobody has it, anywhere.It would be so nice if the movie companies stopped trying to force everyone to buy TWO soundtracks just to get the music from ONE movie."
3,GHOSTRIDERS IN THE SKY,"NOT REALLY A REVIEW. I DID FIND THE SPIDERBAIT VERSION OF "" GHOSTRIDERS IN THE SKY."" IT EVEN HAS THE LITTLE PHRASE "" LETS RIDE "", THE NICHOLAS CAGE SAYS WHEN THEY RIDE TO SAN VEGANZA. GO TO WWW.GOEAR.COM"
3,END SONGS,"THE CLOSEST SONG I HAVE COME UP WITH TO THE END WHERE THEY RIDE IS, THROTTLENECK (INSTRUMENTAL) BY BRAD PAISLEY ON HIS 5TH GEAR CD."
1,Looking for Ghost Riders in the Sky?,"I was going to buy a copy of this until I saw the track listing and read all the reviews! Anyone looking for THAT version of *Ghost Riders In the Sky*, check out a band from the UK called King Kurt, off their album Destination Zululand. I don't know if it is THE version or not, but they are another band who have covered it. I haven't been able to listen to it on the internet, and I'm not willing to buy a copy in case it turns out to be crap. Also check out another alternative version by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes from their album Love Their Country.It is definitly not the one from the movie, but is is a good ""punked up"" version all the same. Happy hunting! Spiderbait (from Australia) have not done a version of it as far as I can find, but they do a blistering version of *Black Betty* if anyone is interested."
2,too brief and not concise,"most of the texts from this series are reliable introductions to the thinkers they discuss. this series is more in depth than the ""beginners"" series of comic introductions. this text falls short in that wittgenstein secondary texts are usually thicker than other texts in the series for a reason. wittgenstein is a complex thinker in which it takes time to explain no less outline. this text to too brief and too generalized to be effective and winds up confusing more than, in wittgensteinian terms, elucidating"
5,plimpton and phoenix rule,"the thing about this movie is, river phoenix is f-ing amazing in it and so is martha plimton. this is a really good movie."
3,Alittle light for a web techie!!!,"I bought the book before amazon had it, it was pre-ordered, so there was no reviews, this book was actually alittle too light for a web developer/ techie. It goes through it very simple step by step, maybe you'll pick up a few tips here and there. One good thing is he sets it up really easy to read, kind of like a conversation between two people. I would recommend this book if you have no internet experience at all, he goes through it like step by step manual very easily read even for a 3rd grader. For someone who has been around the web since 1999 and started a home based web business for 3 years, this book didn't have the ""substance"" in order keep the book. Buy it if you want to make money on the web with no prior experience, don't buy it if you've read ""heavier"" tech books, html, php, ect."
3,Great for anyone getting started online,"I have to admit this was a tough book to get through. It gives you the low down on how to put up your ads etc. But it goes into building the web site and needing a domain etc, that it's off putting.Most of us have done that ages ago, so it's redundant. Focused on the title it's not. Although it's a good read. For the newbie that is."
2,Strange approach and not very informative,"This is a very odd book. Ostensibly it is supposed to be about making easy money using Google's AdSense advertising program. The book is written as a narrative of characters attempting to build a web site that will make them money. It is truly a strange approach.Instead of sticking to the subject of the title, the author instead takes the reader through the mechanics of building a web site, including registering a domain name and --- I kid you not --- ""finding the perfect name."" He then launches into a primer on basic HTML. Very weird in a book supposedly about Google AdSense.Perhaps this book would be useful for a person totally inexperienced in just about everything, including tying their shoes. As a primer on Google's AdSense program, it is very lightweight. There are far better books on the subject.Jerry"
2,Gandhi Review,The book is historically accurate but fails to deliver any sort of punch. It is a slow read which is sad for a man who lead such a dynamic life.
4,A Great Book With Lots of Info on Gandhi,"Wow, what a info packed book. When choosing the book i was skeptical because i thought it would be really boring. But after I learned a little bit about him in History class I decided I would read it. To read this book you needed a lot of patience and you had to really be into it. At some times it got boring, but reading about all of the things he did and the struggles he went through for peace just amazed me. Like when he decided to boycott British goods, schools, and jobs. After doing that he got thrown in jail. Most people would have given up then, but that was just near the start of what had to come. He also did a lot of fasts to show peace and not violence. This book went into great detail talking about all of these topics. This book also showed a few pictures of Gandhi which helped you get a visual image while you are reading the book. So overall i give this book a 4 star rating because it was jam packed with great info and detail."
3,"enlightening, but convoluted","Fischer's recount of Gandhi's life does a satisfactory job of providing facts and commentary on the Father of Modern India. Though this book may seem more approachable, however, because it is considerably shorter than several other biographies (and indeed Gandhi's autobiography), the facts of Gandhi's life and the Indian Nationalism movement are presented anachronistically and often without sufficient context. Thus it is often difficult to have a complete understanding of where, when, how, and to whom Gandhi was applying his peaceful resistance techniques.Notwithstanding Fischer does an excellent job of elucidating Gandhi's worldview and the religious implications behind Gandhi's contrubitions to the shaping of 20th-century world history."
2,Not a history book,"I have had a copy of this book for years and originally thought that it was a valid history book. However, I now know [having read much more about Irish history over the years] that while this is a very interesing read it should not be read as a history book. MacManus was a storyteller who lived about 100 years ago and was popular but he was never a trained historian in any way. Enjoy this if you want fiction."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I was very disappointed when I received this product, especially when I opened it and used it.First of all, it came totally in Spanish. I can read a little Spanish, but not enough to really understand the directions.When I used these wipes on both my computer monitor and television monitor, it streaked the screens and made them worse.You really have to be careful when ordering certain merchandise. Lesson learned!!"
1,Nothing original,"The authors contribute nothing original to an overcrowded field. They bring out the 'same old, same old' attempts to incite some fear about some catastrophe at some future date. Better done elsewhere."
5,bad ass pair of shades!!!!!,Very sleek pair of shades makes me feel like snipes from blade lol. They are small though but a perfect fit for me. I get people wearing oakleys asking who makes them. Saved $30-$40 getting them here on amazon. Nice pair of shades so get them while they last...
4,Costumber review,If you like to use black tees but sometimes you need something more serius this item is perfect
4,a great companion book,this is a great book the further expands your understanding of the cards the explanations are clear and the meditations very nice i highly recommend it for the seeker
4,helpful read,"This book has a lot of useful information. Even though I had learned quite a bit from a previous employer about office management, the book helped fill in the gaps when I went out on my own."
2,Fluffy and as unfilling as marshmallow,"Information is not that useful, although some may find the book encouraging as a personal account of starting a solo practice. The book contains the same general ideas that can be found elsewhere."
4,sturdy but heavy,"This is a shovel that may last you a lifetime. Very sturdy, does a great job pushing the snow. However, it is also very heavy and being of smaller stature, I found it difficult to manage lifting the snow."
3,Humoristic and musical Germans,"BAP is a German band singing in Kölsch which is the dialect spoken in Cologne (yes, where your eau de cologne was invented).The band has a lot of humour and satire in its lyrics. But at the same time, they show high musical skills, and very diversified ones too.Für Usszeschnigge! (it means to cut out, and the LP cover in fact shows paperdolls of the band members and their instruments!) presents a wide range of rock'n'roll songs like the opener Verdamp Lang Her, the album's best track and one of BAP's biggest hits ever.Other highlights are the reggae parody Müsli Man, the electronic rock'n'roll song Südstadt Verzäll Nix and the ballads like Jraaduss."
5,Works Great!,I used this to drill holes in aluminum for tapping. Worked like a charm!Was fast and easy to use!
3,Curious George did it again,If you or the person you are buying this for likes the Curious George books- then go ahead and buy this one. It is the typical monkey business with George trying to be a good little monkey but somehow trouble finds him. The younger grandchildren love how George tries to be good and ends up in a mess again.
2,"Kindle edition: Black and white, poor quality photocopy","I purchased this for use with the Kindle iPad edition and was shocked to discover it's a black and white photocopy. The quality is so bad I'm left confused how this can even be offered as a digital edition. Zooming in to the images you can see quality artifacts, on another page you see the book binding, and using my iPhone some pages only have a few words with the rest of the page blank. I purchased this for a long flight and my 2 year old wasn't even interested (he loves the Curious George Cartoon). It's not captivating and the pictures are so small they can't bring the book to life. I really feel ripped off. For about $1 more you're better off buying a physical copy and scanning it in yourself. I uploaded several screen grabs from the iPhone so you can se before you buy."
2,Very disappointing.,I was very disappointed in this Kindle version of the book for my iPad. I thought I was purchasing a color illustrated book. The cover is brightly colored. Sadly the inside of the book is black and white. It would be nice if you had a look inside feature to children books so you could see what you were buying.
5,Álbum muy interesante!,Disfruté completamente de este álbum. Aquí están las listas de canciones:1- Juega2- Pago Doble3- Traeme Las Estrellas4- Poco A Poco5- Solo Los Dos6- Gloria7- Buscando Un Maizal8- Un Amor Por Un Amor9- Rompecabezas10- So?ar Y Cantar11- El Final12- Gloria (Explosion's Mix)13- Gloria (Radio Edit)
4,Good book!,"I'm a newbie, just starting to study Wicca and the Goddess Path. This book is very good! It's well-written and the style really flows. Some of the info may be outdated and I agree with other reviewers that the rituals are so-so. However, all in all, I really like this book."
3,Just a dictionary,"I purchased this book hoping for a more theological/philosophical viewpoint on the Goddess. I was disappointed that it seemed to be another Wiccan/neo-Pagan book which did not detail WHY people believe, but it only detailed WHAT people believe.Their interpretations do not follow logically, and there exists more than one historical error. The research, method, and interpretations create a work which has no lasting value, but is mired in factless opinion.However, it still has value. I gave this work three stars for it is no worse than most Wiccan/neo-Pagan books on the current market. The rollcall of Goddesses in the final section also provides a good starting point for someone to do their own research from better sources."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"It's all a bit dated, sadly - the sort of TV drama we used to see a lot of, but don't get made now; and watching this you can see why. It's all a bit predictable and slow. Still, to be fair, most of the acting is top notch (Colin Firth, Timothy Spall, James Wilby in particular, although the usually excellent Bill Paterson is something of a hammy characature). I know it's a period piece, but it's also a little hard to believe that 18-year old boys as this naive and awkward, even those with a sheltered public school upbringing. Not to mention the leads are a little long in the tooth (Tim Spall pushing thirty by this time). Still, it does have a certain charm and yes, I did enjoy a trip down memory lane."
4,Amazing space saver,"I just got this table and find it amazingly flexible in size. Shrunk down to a console/desk, it can be tucked into a corner or against a wall, and expanded to its full 6', it easily seats 6. Construction is pretty solid, although mine had a crack in one runner but I fixed it easy enough with a screw. The major cons are that the sections/leaves don't lock together (they spread apart fairly easily on a hardwood floor, leaving open gaps), and they are different lengths when expanded to mid and large sizes (one end is very long, then there's a gap and a short section, then the two leaves, and finally a medium length section)."
3,Pliers - Safety Wire,"This is fair product. If I was going to use this product regularily, I would have bought a better version. This is a cheap Chinese model. It looks like it may have been made in a garage and it is difficult to use. But, it was a low price."
2,Cheap learners pliers,"The pliers were hard to use at first very stiff, and then the metal bent so they could no longer be used. They are made very cheap and I should have thought about it more since they were going to be used for motorcycles and other odds and end things. My suggestion is not to purchase these go for a more name brand approach because these are not worth it and a name brand is only a few dollars more. They are made in China btw there is no name on these at all!"
3,Musical mystery,"Painted Veil is a mild little mystery, fun to read because of its setting, its period detail, and its glimpse into the Baroque world of opera. Hystrionic divas, hysterical directors, a castrato who rested too long on his laurels, down-at-the-heels aristocrats - the book is peppered with colorful characters. Myers' treatment of the Jewish people in Venice is also quite authentic. The pace of the action is less than breathless, but Painted Veil does make a good summer read."
5,Good Mystery for a Weekend,"This book kept me entertained for a long weekend. Tito Amato is a really different detective and the other characters are interesting. I loved learning how things were in Venice at that time--especially the relations between the ghetto and the rest of the city. The plot had a lot of twists and turns, but wasn't overly complicated. Recommended."
5,Good for a healthy chocolate fix,"I love all the varieties of chocolate, and if you mix them in a blender, they are smooth and creamy. You can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes, and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake. Shaking by hand or using a hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice. These are a great meal replacement - healthy, nutritious, and full of quality protein."
3,Faithful follower,I like this product. I built a lot of lean mass after having this shake thrice a day mixed with a big glass of water after workouts.One negative point -- very sweet
1,GROSS!!!,i ran out of my normal protein and had a sample pack of this and wow...it tastes gross!!! it doesnt mix well with water so it was kind of clumpy and the taste was god awful. i would not recommend this product to anyone unless they have lost their sense of taste.
3,Tastes like ground-up vanilla Tums mixed with that powder inside latex gloves,"The title says it all. This stuff is nauseating to ingest. It's chalky, it's thick, (even doing a half-size serving) and I have to chase it with something to get the taste out of my mouth afterwards. It has a strange rubbery smell and flavor; it smells like something you shouldn't be eating. I'm a poor college student, so I eat whatever I can get, and this stuff is my very last resort. Flavor aside, it does fill you up, and it's easy. And all that stuff in it (the ground up Tums and latex glove powder stuff) is probably really good for you. The flavor is my only complaint. It's really atrocious, though. I find it least disagreeable mixed into a smoothie, and most disagreeable mixed with plain water. However, I usually mix it with rice milk, which is slightly better than water, but still disgusting. If you can deal with rubbery, chalky gruel, it's a good buy. If flavor is important to you, move along."
5,this is a good atlas,"Forget those who say that Netter's is better. Grant's shows you what you really see in the lab, and in a person. The drawings in Netter's are highly interpretative and at least in older editions, there are many errors in labelling. If you take the time to read through and look at Grant's closely, you will be amply rewarded."
2,Better than nothing..,"The paddle fits fine and the material is ok. However, the reason I wanted a case for my paddle is because I bought my paddle for $30 and wanted to prolong its life. I'm a college student and it would get dented in my backpack from books and zippers and pencils and whatnot so I bought a case.DOWNSIDE- it's not that durable. My paddle still gets little indentations because the case is not hard enough to protect the paddle from pressure. I need an actual hard metal/plastic/wood case lined with some sort of fabric to protect my paddle. I know there are hard cases for sale out there and I found one for $40...which is more than what my paddle cost."
2,Too tight,"I have the Stiga Titan paddle, It barely fits in it.After I zip it, it presses on the rubber edge.Not good.If they made this cover half inch longer it would be ok.Buy something else for a little more.I know I will."
4,Stiga Table Tennis Racket Case,It is a good product. It has thicker padding than the Butterfly case. The main advantage is that it opens like a book so the paddle can be placed into the case and zipped closed without any possible damage to the rubber cover sheets. The Butterfly case only opens on the top half and the paddle needs to be slid into it with possible folding of the rubber protective sheets. I do not use the little storage pouch but my comment would be for both product that it is small and tight for anything but a shopping list.
4,nice cover,It's a simple racket cover. Seems padded well enough to provide decent proection. I guess it works well :)I gave it 4 stars because the compartment for the balls is very tight and i actually wouldn't put balls inside. Someone else commented that it made imprint on the racket and i can easily see that happen.
4,Very utilitarian,"The product is the least expensive, no frills cover that I could find. It works fine and two balls can be stored inside near the bat's handle. Not wanting to be an advertiser, I wish I could have found the cover in a plain cover or with minimal advertising."
3,Stiga T6940 TT Racket Cover,"The cover fits a penhold handle racket, but not a shakehand racket. The material is OK, but I would consider a better one for an expensive racket."
1,Funny? No.,"I bought this as a gag gift, was about to wrap it, and decided to page through it. While I expected the book to be tongue-in-cheek, I was not expecting descriptions of cruelty. There is nothing funny about that. Would the people who say they love it find it as funny if it were about a dog instead?"
1,It's scary so many people enjoyed this book....,"As with the other negative reviews, I found this book not worth the paper or ink used to create it. If it could be rated a negative 5, I certainly would. There are a lot of psychologically disturbed people out there who WOULD think it entertainment to torture a cat or other creature in this manner; others may attempt it innocently as noted in another review.I speculate the same folks who lauded it, also enjoyed Jeffrey Dalmer's life story for its entertainment value.If one is seriously interested in massageing a cat or dog, please read one of Dr. Micheal Fox's caring books."
5,Sooo Funny,"Look, I own 2 cats and of course any pet owner wouldn't actully DO what the book says and if you tried( yeah, right. Wring your cat out like a towel??How can you not see this is a joke?) you would end upwith plaid cat cratches all over you! Come on!!The book is a joke,period. I found it very funny but I guess we all have different sense of humor."
4,Delightful romp,"Lots of fab characters, delightfully silly conversations, and clever plot twists make this a quick, fun read. I really enjoy this author."
1,Something you want to avoid,"Not sure if it is the hot weather in Arizona, but in less that two weeks, the inner screen basically melted; it looked like blurs of ink. Nonetheless stay away from this product. It was also hard trying to find the right station and the sounds were very staticky."
3,"A splendid blending of logic, technique and NLP","My experience with this book has been intense. I teach sales people how communicate with their clients, so the concepts in the book were very important to me. They're amazing. Unfortunately, they're also too much for the average salesperson to comprehend.As marketing books are invitations for readers to make contact with the authors, I tried to reach the authors on-line -- no website to be found. I tried by phone -- busy signal for hours.The book is wonderful, but it's NLP; how could it not be wonderful? I was surprised by the lack of accessability to the authors. Either they're out of business, in which case the book was unsuccessful, or they're reclusive.I recommend the book for sales people who are highly motivated to achieve more. I also recommend it to for sales trainers. It may change the way you conduct your training."
4,The Complete Guitar Player Songbook met my expectations,This volume was in excellent shape. Notes and words were large and easy to read. Few page turns (important when both hands are busy.) Wish most songs were in lower keys. Not everyone is a tenor!
4,Dark Hearts And Greenland,"Graham Greene novels are like pizza. Even the bad ones are good.And this one is far from bad. Granted, it's another journey into life's laments, which Greene is exceptionally skilled at, but like the best ofhis other work, the journey is filled with interesting sojourners you'repleased to spend a couple of hundred pages with. And happily, his storytelling prowess and dramatic plotting are both fellow journeymen as well.In Burnt Out Case, Greene takes us deep into Africa, and the parallels to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness are easily made. But Greene's story of lepers and healers and builders and believers is its own. Replete with the lies, misunderstandings, regrets and revenge that often populate Green's pages, you can rest assured that not unlike life, what can go wrong, will. go But in the hands of a skilled writer like Greene, you consider yourself lucky for having been along for the ride.Burnt Out Case is well worth a dark trip down the winding river of men's souls."
4,Use of Religion in Burnt-Out-Case,"We consider Querry to be more ""religious"" than the Fathers of the Leproserie. The Fathers keep doing their job because of a vocation by God and not for the sake of the lepers. Querry first doesn't have any motives until he feels needed by the lepers. He acts out of his empathy which he found again in Africa. That's the reason why he's much more honest compared to the Fathers who want to satisfy themselves by helping there. This fact shouldn't be the motive of Christian Love. Without the aim of becoming Christian, he developed Christian characteristics. Graham Greene might have used this plot to criticise those who are sure of their Christian behaviour towards God and the society."
3,Finally on DVD!,"In the same way that it was exciting for ""Tongues Untied"" to be put on DVD, this is too truly a great day. Fans of Marlon Riggs are sure to get nostalgic seeing this. This work is about the diversity in the African-American community, spoken in metaphor as a gumbo. But it is also a memoriam of Riggs made during his last days. Some people may be disturbed by the heavy Rainbow Flag influence here, but you should know what you're getting into if you have heard of the venerable Riggs. While there are militant heroes like Angela Davis here, there are other interviewees, that if you knew more about them, you may see them as selloutish. For those of us who saw this in the 1990s, it will be fascinating to watch it again and examine whether it has stood the test of time. For example, HAART medications, 9/11, the DL, and many other phenomena have altered how we look at identity categories in the new millenium. I do recommend this important documentary for all interested viewers."
4,Gone to soon!,"Is producer did a great job in a time he had making this documentry, it is a movie that should be seen by all."
4,Christmas Gift for the boyfriend...,"It's a little hard for me to review the actual dvd set b/c it is a gift for my boyfriend. However, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition. This boxset normally sells for close to $200.00. I'm in medical school and have to be careful how I spend my money. Thank you for making it possible to get this at such a great price!"
4,Great stuff,"This is such a fun series. You follow the winning team from the regular season through to the super bowl. It is documentary style with a narrator (different for each game), through interviews (from now and then), and some really excellent footage of the games. It focuses on the players, coaches and the dynamics that the team fought with and against to pull it together. Only thing I feel is lacking is just a little info on the opposing team."
4,Love the mix of musics!,"I received my product very quickly. I loved the music, a blend of pygmy chants and songs and electronic music. My favorite is the lullaby. I could listen to it all day! Very sweet!"
2,Just another propaganda film.,"The standard propaganda crap. Interesting, but not to be taken too seriously. The writers and producers of this series would have us believe that Hitler was worst than Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan and the Devil himself; that the so-called 'Holocaust' was the single most important event in history... Did they forget the millions more that were murdered by Stalin and his Bolsheviks? The World was a very different place back then. Racism, Imperialism, antisemitism, Darwinism and eugenics were popularly held beliefs throughout Western society and elsewhere. In the USA, great land of freedom and democracy, Blacks were segregated and treated as second-class citizens! Concentration-camps were a British idea from the Boer War; collective-punishment and mass execution was the typical manner in which the Colonial Powers dealt with insurgency, the German people have been unfairly singled-out. The Nazis were merely a product of their time and must be viewed in the proper context."
1,Warning,"The Nazis - A Warning from History is an attempt to vilify every German who lived in the 20th century and to systematically categorize them as ""evil"". Obviously this is some effort to deflect current controversial political issues onto some past event and ""learn again"" from History. Well, no one has ever ""learnt from History"" and it repeats. America claims to be a nation of ""democracy"" when it has spent the last six years creating bloodshed in the middle east, all for the control of oil reserves. The book should concentrate on the political and economic forces that shaped the 1930 German state and not debase the German people."
1,A great cast can't save this movie.,"Empty and pointless story. Poor screenplay. And worst of all, characters that the audience just doesn't care about.The final plot twists lack purpose and leave the viewer thinking: ""So what? ""This movie strives to be insightful, full of suprises, and make the audience think... Unfortunately the story is shallow and fails miserably."
4,"Above all, I like the music!","Above all, i liked the music. The story was a little weired, but okay. It is just one of Hollywood's love-story movies. Kinski was so beautiful. I wanna looking for her another movies. The music made movie fantastic."
1,Not the most awesome textbook,"Some very stupid things are said in this textbook and I honestly can't figure out why anybody would use it for a college course. I think they should use ""How to survive and Prosper as an Artist"" by Caroll Michels. That is a much better book."
3,Good Book,"Haven't finished it yet, but has some good insight. I think it would be a good read for someone wanting togo to art school."
4,My Review of The Practical Handbook for the Emerging Artist,"I am finding the book very helpful. Every artist should read it. It is easy to read, short sweet and to the point. This book was required reading for a class I'm taking on Exhibition Design. I wish it wasn't so expensive!"
4,good practical tips for serious starters,I am a serious starter and enjoy the barrage of intelligence in this book. Great advice that keeps me going.
1,SUMO,"Grainy, soft focus photos. Very impressionistic. Not very satisfying, not aesthetically pleasing either."
1,This was awful,I already knew this was going to be a bad movie so I watched it online and I still want to erase my memory for seeing it like that. Watching grass grow had more entertainment then this movie. Most of the key characters are missing liek the red ribbon army and where is Krillin? Why is Goku learning how to be a airbender and not a fighter? When did they let the green goblin play piccalo? Overall worst movie ever if you watch it you will want to burn your eyes out.
1,The worst movie of 2009!,"If a franchise should be rebooted than it's DB because Dragonball Evolution is a joke!It's so bad that you can either laugh or destroy the blu-ray!The writers of this movie have absolutely no clue what they wanted to do with the story.It's not a great reboot like Startrek, it's a mess.Dragonball is not that complicated it's about Son Goku, his journeys and awesome fight scenes.Every single bit that is awesome in the comics, anime and games is missing.No stunning fight scenes, no funny characters, no storyline that makes a tiny bit sense.DB is about fighting guys and not a highschool romance story between Goku and Chichi.Even the great Piccolo turns into a complete whiner in this movie.But the one thing that really upsets me as a DB-fan is is that they dared to call the dvd/blue-ray release ""the z-edition"". DB Z is the most awesome part of the DB storyline and has nothing to do with this movie.It's an insult!"
1,Horrible,As a Dragon Ball fan I can only say that the money I spent at the theater was already the biggest waste of $10 I have ever indulged in. Don't waste your money on a DVD the would be more enjoyable if it were used as a drink coaster.
1,Someone Please Get the Butcher,This movie was totally butchered. This movie is not even worth the rating. Unfortunately the movie deviates horribly from the original DB series. Like other reviews head for the hills on this one. The movie is just wrong on so many levels. I mean even Goku's character was completely off-based. What I cannot understand is there is maybe three Japanese people a Japanese film.. Something is wrong here. Why is that? Anyways it do not waste your time and go find real quality movies.
1,hollywood needs to stop,This is Pathetic.everytime a movie is made about a popular anime in the USAits raped and turned into a saturday morning disney showcrap fest.with all the characters changed to white dumb teenagerswho don't show any good acting skills.American tv and film is returning the the racist stereotypes.that it started with so long ago and this needs to stop.if i could i wouldn't give this piece of crapa star.Akira Toriyama must have been so insulted when he saw this.it needs to stop.
1,Where's Dragonball Z?,"If you know Dragonball and Dragonball Z you'll notice that this story dosn't follow Z at all, ever, in anyway. it has aspects of Dragonball minus any amount of accuracy. The entire story is destroyed in the first 30 seconds and then it just keeps on going... and going... and going... and going... and going... and going... and going... and going... and when you've given up on any ounce of the strory being right they destroy another aspect of the story leaving you flabberghasted even more and more enraged than you could ever imagine. If there was an option to, I would have given it 0 stars. The shortest sumation I can give is that this is without a doubt the worst movie ever, EVER!"
2,"yep, pretty bad.","I really wanted to like this, despite all the bad reviews. But yeah if you're a fan of DB, DBZ etc... you will feel this really misses the mark. for those not familiar they will get lost and lose interest. I give it 2 stars out of respect for the source material and passable special effects. everything else from casting, acting to story is a miss. don't know if it's the worst movie ever but it's definitely in the conversation."
2,dissapointment,as someone who grew up watching the series i was highly dissapointed when this came out i didnt care for the cast at all except chow yun fat they grabbed one of the chicks from one of the real world seasons and put here one here im not gonna ramble on because enough people have already done it but ill say this i know theyre making another one hopefully they re do the whole cast except chow yun fat and get the movie atleast pg 13 and and definitly get rid of the guy playing yumcha
1,Horrible,It was just a terrible movie. Not anything like Dragonball. A slap to the face of the Dragonball francise.
1,NOT A GOOD MOVIE,"This movie truly is horrible. The story was poorly translated and, the action was absolutely nothing stellar. Trulya waste of time. This was a series created in the 1980s with exceptional stoy telling and action scenes, This is 2009 in the USAand the movie certainly did not match up to the show's charisma, that captivated millions, at all. Which is why it was pulledout of theaters and got the poor treatment by majority of fans and others, which it deserved. A VERY cliche and rushed storyline. Dragonball Evolution was child abuse, it felt like it was written by the director's five year with crayola crayons. Seriously the dialogu, even for a PG rated movie was PRETTY CHEESY. This movie is like the demon child of Power Rangers and High School Musical (Without the music.) You really should save your money for something truly worthwhile and has a shred of effort put into it."
2,So bad...,"If you're are fan of dragonball or DBZ, you will hate this movie. If you are a fan of movies, you will also hate this movie.I rented this out of morbid curiosity. After watching it, I realize how sick I really am.Avoid this movie."
5,Damn entertaining,"I am an avid fan of the cartoons, and while this does take artistic license, I think it preserves the spirit of the characters. How are you supposed to take hundreds of hours of episodes and boil them down into a 90 min movie? The effects weren't cheesey like the nerdy ass fanboys say. The biggest mistake FOX made was doing absolutely no advertising (there were no previews on TV in my area), and it was only in theaters for a week! (i went to try to see it the next week) I hope people can put aside their preconceptions and see it with an open mind. I would like to see this catch on in cult status like Donnie Darko or True Romance and do well enough on DVD so they make a sequel (Hopefully with Vegeta!)"
4,"Great product, slow shipping",The product itself I give 5 stars but am knocking off one star for the shipping.This is a great product that works well for my two dogs with chronic ear infections. The product arrived in good condition and was as advertised. My only complaint is the length of time it took for shipping. I placed 2 more orders a couple of days later and they were delivered before the Epi-Otic. This company ships USPS which appears to be slower than UPS. It will not prevent me from ordering this product from this company again but in the future I will plan for the delay in shipping.
5,Good product,"I normally was getting this product from my vet. but, found it cheaper to purchase this way and, was happy the price was less the amount more."
2,Not what I expected,I thought a product coming from this Lady would be great. Not. Little here to help me with my end of life plans.
1,ONLY WORKS FOR 1 YEAR!!!!,"This product is only good for 1 year. I don't remember seeing that discussed when I purchased it. I bought the Protection Portfolio, and now it is no good. In order to get the product online, I have to repurchase it. So, basically I spent good money for nothing. How would Suze Orman feel about that in my budget? Two thumbs down!"
1,I would give it zero stars if i could.,"This DOES NOT WORK on intel macs. this will not work on anything younger than 3 or 4 years old. I called and wrote them trying to get a refund but was disconnected and ignored. they say it works on intel but when i called and said i am unable to get it to work on a mac the lady politely asked ""are you using windows xp"" WTF? i wanted to use my credit card for this but used my debit card, and now i cant even do a charge back.will never but anything with her name again."
1,"Buggy program, no help if you have problems","This is a buggy, buggy program that compounds its own problems by its bad design. Here's the bug I ran into: It insisted that I enter data in categories that didn't fit. I don't have a business, but it wouldn't let me proceed without entering data that doesn't exist. It has NO alternate navigation, NO help buttons, NO documentation, NO e-mail address, NO URL for a Web site. It's unusable and user-hostile.This shows the limits of programs for idiots: Maybe it's great if you don't hit a bug or a snag. But if you do, it's like they've led you down a narrow path through a canyon, and then dropped a ton of bricks across the path in front of you, with no escape except to back up and walk away."
3,"Nice looking, no sound","This is a beautiful chime. But, you will never hear a sound out of it, even in a very strong wind."
5,A Must Read for Those Considering Weight Loss Surgery,"This book presents all facets of weight loss surgery, including what should happen and what could go wrong. It's helped prepare me to make the decision whether or not this is the right step for me to take. It's helped me know what to expect and have a realistic view of the procedure and life afterwards."
5,FANTASTIC SOURCE OF INFORMATION!,I wish that I had found this book when I was trying to make up my mind about surgery. It is so chock full of information. I bought it about a week or so before my gastric bypass surgery and it has become my guidebook. Everything in it goes right along with everything my doctor has told me. I took my copy to the hospital with me and it became my bible. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has had any kind of weight loss surgery or is considering it. I refer to it almost everyday. I am 11 days post surgery and plan to continue to use this book for a long time
5,Weight Loss Surgery for Dummies,The book is very informative for anyone thinking about having surgery or planning to have surgery.
2,Not the best tool out there.,"So here it is 2 years later after the weight loss surgery and I have even re-read the book but didn't get a lot out of it. Most of what the book covers you can learn from taking classes with your doctor prior to surgery. What would have been nice is to find a book to talk about the real feelings folllowing the 1st two weeks after. That for many is the critical turning point for experiencing every emotion under the sun, joy, depression, pain, hunger....this book didn't touch on the real emotions, and how every person may be different in what they can eat after surgery, instead they gave basic recipes."
1,Terrible book - don't waste your time & money,"I don't know what people who would review this book well are thinking. These authors may be good at creating the UML, but terrible at explaining it. The sentences are packed with words they haven't explained - or uncommon uses of words that really have no meaning, unless you are already a UML expert. I can't imagine a more poorly written text."
2,A reader in the Netherlands,"I am an UML trainer and have used all three books by the amigos. I shall relate what my students have to say ... The reactions from my students is that the Booch book lacks depth (my students work in embedded systems, workflow, CAD ...), repeats itself and is unsuitable for serious work. Booch's earlier books did have some real applications (for example, the Home Heating System). In particular, his use of state machines was good. Today, they have been scaled down somewhat (they are mostly of the so-called anthroposophic kind and thus useless). Concluding, it is a pity that someone with the wealth of knowledge and background that the author has has not taken the effort to produce something of more value. After all, novice developers look up to the 3 amigos as being the 'gurus' of UML."
2,Waste of money.,Book is complete waste of money. Find more prevalent information online. Not really a required book. Not used at all.
4,The Unified Modeling Language User Guide,oh great this is the great introductory book .which must be reviewed by every one.this is the book given by rational university in their 4 day training module.really it's good book for studying)not for reading) and understanding abc's of umlfrom three ambigos.any how thanks for authors for giving such a great book.i had read full book from first to last.i din't find any page not usuful.so try to refer this book at least once.
3,Could have been better,"My feelings on this book are mixed. It is a large book for what it offers (almost 500 pages that take a lot of time to read) but it does provide a thorough introduction to UML. It also discusses some advanced modeling concepts and constructs (sections 3 & 5) but it leaves the reader wanting to look elsewhere for how to apply these. There is an irritating duplication of material in different parts of the book, but I liked the appendices that included some of the standard elements of UML and a very brief summary of the Rational Unified Process. If you have the (a lot of) time to read the book or you are one of the many fans of Booch's writings, then this book will be of value."
1,Bought these for my mom ...,"a few days later I asked to see her new earrings.""I'm not wearing them"" she said.""Why not?""""They broke.""They broke, both of them at the clasp, the day after Mother's Day--the day after I gave them to her."
5,Good book but didn't match description.,"The item I received did not match the description. The item was listed under a full 6 volume set. I only received one book. When I contacted the seller he/she was nice enough to apologize and send a full refund. The seller also allowed me to keep the book to make up for the inconvenience. I expressed that there was no inconvenience but just wanted them to make the correction in the description. Thanks so much. Overall, I would recommend this seller."
4,This will definitely take you to deeper depths,"This is a very thorough and in-depth study of the word of God.Reading it, you can feel the author's love for the Lord,and his love for the word.It is filled with knowledge and wisdom, and it will help you grow, and go to higher highs and deeper depths.You do need to keep your bible beside it, as it does not show the scriptures, just the reference; chapter/verse.The book is heavy, 2000 pages thick, good for reading at a desk or table but hard to take along.The print is small, so middle aged-like me, or older readers will need adequate lighting and maybe some reading glasses...Overall, I'm very pleased with the commentary."
4,comments on Matthew Perry,"I like the fact that the whole set of commentaries is in one book and it is affordable. The print, however, is very small."
5,"""Egg-legant""",This is a beautiful and festive way to serve deviled eggs (or even a small appetizer) for the holidays. Looked great on the buffet this past Christmas.
5,"Excellent, I highly recommend this book.",I have read this book several times and enjoy it each time I read it. Still looking for other books by Mr. Saint.
5,If you give your copy away you will end up buying another,"I read this book twice when it was first published. It has stuck vividly in my mind ever since, I have even had it enter my dreams occasionally. That's another way of saying that it is memorable. Buy it. Read it. Don't give your copy away because you will be like me, years later you end up buying another copy since you have to read it again."
3,it's a electric razor,"ok for the price no better no worse than any other electric razor. nothing beats an old fashion blade shave. Electric razors just are not made for heavy beards, fine for peach fuzz"
1,nice when you dont have a lot of beard.,"Like the title says. it works nice when you dont have a lot of beard.I have a hard beard, when i try to use it after 2 days of not shaving my beard its very hard to get the long hairs to get cut, this is bad because i cant get rid of disposables razors completely :(EDIT: I quit using this after like 3 weeks. It does not shave properly, leaves lots of hair behind, even when you try it like a dozen times over the same spot. Got tired of this. Just use disposables. Less irritation, less time spent, very smooth shave."
4,Shamalamadingdong...,"Are you really going to listen to a guy's review in which it is titled ""Shamalamadingdong..."" Well, just in case you are, this is the best quality razor you can buy for the price. Long lasting battery life. I live with a few roommates who continually unplug my razor to power up their Sonicare toothbrushes. Pansies. Anyway. In the morning the razor works beautifully and sometimes I even end up with a closer shave than my Gilette.It's nice to have in the shower when I am in a hurry and works really well with shaving gel. A quality product especially for the low price."
3,plastic box,i works well so far.i thougt it would be a little more sturdy and solidly built. one drop from the desktop and it could be history.
4,Adequate USB hub for a sterilized office,"I don't want to sound grumpy about this USB hub. I've had my hub for more than a year now and it has worked with all of the flash drives I've plugged into it. The four ports on the back of the hub are too close for my liking.I can't speak to the iPod shuffle (don't have one) but my digital camera plugs in nicely. For personal use, though, I'd like a little more design and personality to go along with the functionality."
5,Now this is what I call a Rock Band!,"hey, a salute to this band for their straight edge power blues and pschydelic music all pumped up in hard rock music. I was really surprise after hearing their latest ""Deep"" CD. This 3-man rock band is good, I mean really good and I hope they bring this kind of music well to the next milleniun. We should give credit to this Mother.."
5,The best AWK yet!,"I love, love, LOVE this album! So much better than the Wolf, and as much fun as I Get Wet. The lyrics are great and flow better with the music than in the Wolf. Not to mention AWK writes some pretty inspirational stuff on his website. It's just fun to listen to, and reminds us that life does not have to be so emo."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"Andrew W.K. parties hard. He released a new album in japan in 2006 with 18 tracks plus 4 bonus tracks on the chinese and korean versions. How hott is that. He kinda sings on it a bit in parts instead of just yelling. It's rilly good. It's called Close Calls With Brick Walls. Check it. He can write good tunes. He still has the same Meatloaf/Supertramp piano riff on every song. It's awesome. And his new lyrics make even less sense. ""i want your face because everyone says I look like you"". And there's a song about wanting to go on a date where he says ""let's go on a date"" and ""i want to take you on a date"" a bunch of times. I think it's called ""Let's Go On A Date"". And there's this one called ""Hand On The Place"" about having his hand on the place but not knowing if his hand is just floating through space or into the place that was showing but he still had his hand oh he still had his hand on the place. The man is clearly insane. This record is the bomb."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you listen to this album about 10,000 it might actually grow on you but I wouldn't waste my time. Buy the albums I Get Wet or The Wolf instead and you wont be disapointed."
4,"My 7 yr old loves this story, and so do I","This is a very nice story about a slave boy growing up on a Virginia plantation. It is taken from a true story, and a little about the person is written at the end. It is well written and enjoyable for children, and gives them a peak at what life must have been like as a slave without be morose. It is also well illustrated. My 7 year old requests it be read to her on a regular basis."
3,ok,this is a good set of dolls.But the mom is very ugly ps im 18 i have a little girl 2 its just i dont have a name
1,pieces are flimsy and break easily,"this toy is flimsy and pieces fall off leaving ladders and attachments all over the floor. the helicopter blades fell off just getting the toys from the package. if you are looking for a stay in the box toy... great... but if you were looking for a toy, keep looking"
5,way funnier than the new one,I love this old classic. It is a whole lot funnier and just plain fun to watch. Alot less complicated than the new one. My kids loved this one. This was Disney at its best.
1,Motsenbocker's product ruined 2 articles of clothing,"I used the graffiti remover to take off some oily food stains on a white pair of pants and a red t-shirt. It left blotchy stains wherever I put it, no matter how much I rubbed. Clorox didn't take out the discolorations on the white pants. I had to throw out both of these things.I've used all kinds of stain removers over the years, and some of them just plain didn't work, but none of them ever ruined my clothes.I didn't like giving it even one star!I will never buy ANY other product from your company."
4,Soul Classics,"Hello,The item came as requested - very nicely packaged chock full of some of my favourite songs. I enjoyed it very much! What else can I say?"
2,Insipid characters...,"I usually read books in a sitting or two, but this one didn't hold my attention very well - it took me a week of stopping and starting to get through it. The characters didn't invoke much sympathy - to my frustration, I found them to be incredibly shallow and entirely lacking good judgment. Even worse, the entire plot was predictable. My advice? If you want to read this book, borrow it from the library or purchase it used."
3,Highly Predictable,"Although this book was highly predictable, it was a fun read. I found myself skipping many chapters without the fear of missing anything because it was dead obvious how the story would end up. Still, it wasn't a bad book. It was entertaining and light hearted."
4,A fun and light summer read,"I read Thirtynothing right after finishing Ralph's Party, both of which I enjoyed. If you're a fan of the vastly popular single gal in London genre galloping on the heels of the Bridget Jones sucess, then you're sure to enjoy Thirtynothing. The novel features a loveable cast of characters, fun and clever writing, and even a bit of mystery. This is a perfect book to take along to the beach this summer, or for a bit of relaxing weekend reading. Also recommended is Marian Keyes."
1,not worth the money..,"The plot is almost entirely predictable, the parts of the plot that aren't predictable are just ridiculous. The characters are annoying, if not totally unrealistic. The story is saccharine sweet and offers not even a morsel of wit to top it off!"
2,I don't get it....,"I can't connect with this author's style. It's like he has confused points of view. He's taken 3rd person omniscient and bled some of that omniscientism into the supporting cast of the protagonist (but leaving the protagonist unscathed by this external blessing of knowledge). What this means is that there is alot of internal dialogue by the protagonist with mysterious unsolocited answers by characters in the book that are taken for granted. Because they all (ok not all... a large portion) share this ""line-of-reasoning"" with the protagonist, it is hard to define the edges, boundaries, and distances between the different characters. It's still good enough to want to know how it ends, but the experience is not as fun as it should be."
5,"""Cardassians"" is a wonderful, quiet show","DS9's ""Cardassians"" is interesting from its very first scene until its conclusion. Dialouge crackles, plotting is complex, and the characters come alive. ""Cardassians"" centers around an abandoned Cardassian war-orphan named Rugal, who was left behind when Cardassia withdrew from Bajor, his parents presumanbly killed during the occupation. Rugal is acted suprisingly well, considering Trek's reputation of hiring bad teenage actors. The story makes Bashier out to be a very determined man, which is consistent with ""The Wire."" Sisko comes off as a quiet, but forceful commander. Gul Dukat (DS9's main villain) is schemeing in top-form here, making a villain we love to hate. Oh yes, and there's ""plain and simple"" Garak, who gets lots of screen time this week and is marvelous. All in all, ""Cardassians"" is an excellent show, worth a place in your collection."
2,No longer worth buying,"Like all gay travel guides, the information dates quickly andis now no longer relevant, making it purely of historic interest now."
2,More like a baby kitten fisher,"I purchased one of these to exercise my kittens. I got in early january, and it broke today, march 1st. My kittens are about 6 months old. The rod snapped just below the hinge, where the slider is. Save your money and by ice fishing rod and reel for the same amount. Beware, it is your typical ""made in China"" kind of product/plastic.I loved this thing, when it worked, got the cats going and focused and worked great in that respect. The line is weak and you'll spend a lot of time retying it, and you will learn about the inner workings of the reel because it gets jammed on the regular. And now that it's broke and the whole thing is garbage and not reusable, I'm disappointed.I highly recommend the lures, and I will continue to reuse them. But I will replace this with a ice fishing rod and reel that can handle being used."
1,HORRIBLE Don't bother!,"While a great idea, manufacturer should have truly TESTED this before putting it on the market. My cat loved it, but how sad that it constantly broke down - the line gets wound up inside the reel cover and casting is impossible until you get out your tools and take it all apart, cut the line & re-attach it. You hands will also get very greasy. AFTER 10 DAYS OF FIXING IT, THERE WASN'T MUCH LINE LEFT AND THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL GROWS EACH TIME YOU HAVE TO FIX IT - EVEN THOUGH YOU GET PRETTY GOOD AT THE REPAIR AFTER A COUPLE OF TIMES, IT'S JUST CRAZY TO SPEND MORE TIME ON REPAIR THEN PLAYING WITH YOUR CAT!Not worth any money but if they could fix it, it would be great! I won't bother calling BAMBOO as others here said they won't reply...I'll make my own. BAMBOO-PLS TAKE THIS OFF THE MARKET UNTIL YOU CAN MAKE ONE THAT CASTS WITHOUT THE LINE GETTING WOUND UP INSIDE THE REEL!"
2,"Good idea, lasted 15 minutes.","This is a really good idea for a cat toy -- I'm sure that my feline friend and I would still be playing with it today, were it not for the fact that the reel snagged up 15 minutes after I took it out of the packaging. I spent about 2 hours trying to unsnag it, but it just wasn't happening. My recommendation: take a real fishing pole, only use the bottom segment, attach a leader, then use the Catfisher toys attached to that. That's all catfisher has done here, except they've used an unbelievably cheap plasticky fishing pole and a reel that is impossible to get inside and unsnag."
4,"Good BT unit, cable is a tad short","Yes, I bought the cable knowing the length, I still thought it would be slightly less awkard. The product functions extremely well - no connectivity or static issues that you find with some BT units. I'd recommend it to friends."
2,No good for TV,I bought this to listen to TV with my Bluetooth headset. There is a slight delay causing the audio to be out of sync with the video.Other than that I feel it would be fine for strictly audio alone.
5,Great Xmas gift,"Great gift for my son-in-law, since he got a bike rack from Santa to go with it for his vehicle."
4,Good investment,"Although it's a little overpriced, it is a great way to protect your bikes while on the rack. We really like how everything stays with the bike rack, except for the key. That way, you aren't hunting for all the parts."
1,"DON""T BUY IT","I bought this book for my 6 year old grandson for Christmas. I was so disappointed by the vulgarity and ""F"" bomb in it. I threw it in the trash. Buyer Beware!"
1,FDA warns not to use in children under 2 years old,"Since my baby is teething, the first thing that came to my mind is she needs baby orajel. However, I was reading online that the FDA issued a warning in 2011 that benzocaine can cause a baby to stop breathing. This is because it can cause increased concentrations of methemoglobinemia which is similar to hemoglobin except that it doesn't have the oxygen carrying capacity that hemoglobin has. Therefore, depriving your baby of oxygen. I used this for my son in 2009, and he was okay with it. However, because of the warning, I'm not risking it with my daughter."
4,Issues #37-#43 of the Vaughan/Guerra series,"This trade paperback collects issues #37-42 of the excellent DC Comics series. Series co-creator Pia Guerra pencils the three-issue ""Paper Dolls"" story arc. Yorick and Agent 355 spend a day in decaying Sydney, Australia, searching for Beth but instead running afoul of a zealous tabloid reporter. Meanwhile, Dr. Mann bonds with an Australian who may or may not still be a spy and the Israeli soldiers reappear with Yorick's mother in Washington, DC.Goran Sudzuka pencils the remaining three issues. The subpar #40 centers on Hero and Yorick's other Beth while the excellent #41 is chiefly backstory on Agent 355. #42 focuses on Yorick's monkey Ampersand who may have the cure for the plague. I enjoyed this book, though not as much as some of the earlier ones: I'm looking forward to Book 8."
2,REALLY small!!,"I just bought the fuel belt!! I bought the pink one and it is really cute, but the sad news is it is way too small. I bought the size medium and it is way too tight! Not good to have a muffin top over the fuel belt. I guess it makes you keep running to have to see that sight!! Great idea just remember to order a size bigger!!"
3,Dummed Down Dummies,It's a really good book - filled with all the information you need to know to starting up your aqaurium. I found it really dumed-down though (I suppose good if you know nothing about fish) so I found it really difficult to sit to down & read the whole thing. Alot more technical information then on fish themselves - best place to find good advice on filters. Overall I'm glad I bought it - but it's not the staple of my fish-book collection.
3,Works well for most people with one side effect.,I used this product twice a day and saw a big difference in the crepe-y look around my eyelids but also noticed a side effect. My eyes are sensitive and run a little bit. Sometimes my vision is blurry right after I use the product. I do have sensitive skin.
1,"That was pretty bad, and I don't usually complain","I have to admit, this thing was pretty bad. I have written one review in the past five years and it was to praise a product. I don't usually complain, but this item was well below expectations. The light assembly on mine was broken when I received it. I've got it downstairs trying to glue it back together, but the design is weak to begin with. It also looks and feels cheap. There was extra plastic from the manufacturing process that I had to trim off of every piece, like a kids model car. Lastly, the finish around the lens on one side is so bad I don't know if a trim ring came off or that is just the way it looks. No other parts were floating around in the box. This is the only thing out of about a dozen orders in December that Amazon flubbed. I'll cut them some slack, it was a $5 dollar item, worth only $2, so if the glue doesn't work I'll just trash it without a return. You don't have to make my same mistake though."
1,Junk,Yes it is a magnifier. But the plastic literally broke taking it out of the box. I know a lot of reviewer exaggerate when they don't like something. But this thing truly did break right away. It is way overpriced for the quality.
4,Great mascara for people with allergies,"Great mascara for people with allergies, cleans off easily, lengthens lashes, had trouble finding a good mascara that did not hurt my eyes and this works great. Highly recommend."
3,Not as intellectually engaging as I had hoped,"When I first heard about this book, I was more than thrilled. Finally! A book that addresses the complicated mythology of Alias in a smart, and intellectually-stimulating way. But sadly, this book proved to be disappointing.While I did love a few of the articles in the book, I also found some of them to be a ""fact dump"" with little analysis. If I wanted a plot summary, I wouldn't have spent $14.95 on a book that promised analysis.As a graduate student, I honestly hoped that ""Alias Assumed: Sex, Lies and SD-6"" could be useful in my research of modern television, but unfortunately, it wasn't. But if you want a fun book that might raise a few ideas you hadn't considered about your favorite show, it's well worth the read! :)"
2,I really didn't like the main character.,"I agree with the reviewers who noted that the book was well-researched, but still unsatisfying. I gave it an extra star precisely for that research, but that shouldnot imply that the book is worth reading. Because unfortunately, it is not.Matteson needs to go back to some basics and learn how to write characters. Charlotte Graham is *entirely* unbelievable and the plots are incredible, even by cozy standards. My credulity as a reader was constantly being strained to the breaking point.Skip this one."
2,Terrible reading material.,This book is like something I would have read in junior high school. It is too predictable and the writing is very simple- there is no real mystery. I think the characters are very undefined. I also think she needs a better editor; I found so many errors in the punctuation. Also she needs to make more sentences with more than 5 or 6 words.
3,It Depends...,"Is it good? Is it bad? If you like watching news shows and follow the headlines, you'll appreciate this film. If you like the actors, you'll think they could've done better. If you hate politics and everything surrounding it, this film will help you hate it all more. If you hate the popular media and how they latch onto any story and report anything, you'll hate them more after you see this - and you should. It's an eye-opener. It could be real; we'd never know. If that kind of thing intrigues you, it's a film for you."
1,Wag? My tail didn't wag an instance...,"Clearly by the rating you have to be expecting some sort of negative positions on the film, and you'd be right. Because in my opinion this film was trumped up to comedy gold, only to realize itself as nothing but a false laugh in the back of an empty theatre. Yeah, I don't know what that sentence entirely means, but I do know that Wag the Dog lacked realism (except for the end, but assuming there's a chance you may actually watch this I figure I'll be nice enough not to spoil this.)The plot centers around DeNiro, who is a political mind who is supposed to help control public opinion in the face of a presumably soon-to-be leaked sex scandal. To spin his magic DeNiro teams up with a Hollywood producer, played by Dustin Hoffman, who plans on making this cover-up the masterpiece of his career.Well, that's the story. So now you know the basic beginning to what I believe is far from a masterpiece, as Wag the Dog lands much closer to a master flop."
4,"""Wag the dog""- is everything true what U see in the media??","The movie ""Wag the dog"" is directed by Barry Levinson in 1997. In the movie are starring dustin Hoffamnn, Kirsten Dunst and robert De Niro. The movie is a comical satire.the movie is about an reelection from the president of the USA- the only problem is that he had an sexual affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.The crewfrom the president want to make that the president will be reelected because of this they think about how they can do it. They go to a producer; with his help they have an idea: war against Albainia only or the election.with this they influence the american people.If U want to know more buy the movie.....In my opinion it is a good film becaus eit shows in what way the american people(not only they- everybody) can be influenced by the media.The message is that U don't have to believe everything U see"
3,A Stimulating Diversion,"Wheras politics is not always my cup of tea, Wag The Dog certainly has some amusing moments. When the president gets caught in engaging in an ainappropriate affair, leave it to Dustin Hoffman an Robert De Nero to come to the rescue. These guys create a make beleive war an coach the press secretary into diverting the public's attention.onto the small screen.When the initial story runs out of steam, another idea about glorifying a supposed war hero caught behind enemy lines makes its way on to the small screen. At this point the president's sexual escapades certainly is somewhat ignored.Wag The Dog certainly makes you think how scanals within government can be covered up quite effectively."
2,"Seasonally interesting, but not very good script for these fine actors",This movie doesn't have a great plot and script. It is interesting to watch before a presidential election to remind oneself how far the campaigns might go to try to get your vote.
1,Try to avoid this movie,"This movie is really awful. It presents itself to be a witty, humorous look at politics and Hollywood, but it fails in both attempts. I have yet to see a movie that explores the life of a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) that is interesting, and this hasn't changed my mind. The scenes where a bunch of people come up with ""brilliant"" ideas are really annoying. Also, Willie Nelson is on the screen a lot, which attests to just what lengths the director had go to. If you want a movie about politics, ""Primary Colors"" (the best) or ""The Contender"" (the best serious politics film) are my recommendations. An added plus: neither of those two have Anne Heche."
1,Ugh,Like overacting? See Dustin Hoffman's stereotypical portrayal of a Hollywood mogul. Like inept acting? See Anne Heche make little grimaces and vapid hand gestures while pretending she's ... what? Her characterization is so shallow I'd walk through it in new suede shoes. Every point is belabored and the dialog is simplistic. Wag the Dog is nothing more than Hollywood schlock with a trendy subject. Final analysis: boring and irksome.
2,trouble to digest this book,"This book, very puzzling. I read last night on way back from very excellent smorgasborg dinner at friend house. He make extra fine meatloaf with bread and also butter. I never so full. In all my life, I say, and very happy too. So then what? I read book. So depressing, you see. Mr. Tyrus Miller, he crack open modernism like rotten coconut and pour out spoiled milk for all to see. Now I am so sick and in pain, surely I die soon."
4,Neon Genesis Evangelion 0:1 is great!,"I baught this tape and it has epesodes 1 and 2. And of course you want to buy this because it's the first epesodes. But hey thats what i thought but it did not turn out that great, resen why i rated this with 4 starts is mainly for the secound epesode on this tape, it is FUNNY, man. But you should still get this because even though it was not that all good it is still cool, but you would need to get the next tape to because it ends, with a continuation :( So, get this any how it is still cool. Peace out! - Jtaz"
4,Happy w/purchase,"This is our first LCD TV. Our tube TV finally died. My wife actually picked out this unit and Consumer Reports also recommended this unit. We purchased it directly from AMAZON on January 23, 2007. I wanted to wait a couple of months before I write my review to see if anything happens. But to my surprise the TV is still running and there have been no problems. We have digital HD and the pictures are great. It took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast. However, if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat. But overall its a good buy for us."
4,One of my all time favorites!,"I just love how Fred MacMurray plays an eccentric millionaire and how he interacts with others. Gave it 4 stars because I watched on Amazon Instant Video and the video quality was poor and the sound was not synced with the picture. Should have downloaded it first. Tested my internet connection about halfway through, and it was rock solid with a 5 Meg download and upload... so something screwy was happening over at Amazon Instant Video.Update:Amazon noticed from my review that the Instant Video streaming produced a poor quality viewing experience and automatically issued me a refund for the rental. Can't speak to highly of Amazon's excellent customer service!"
3,Kinda long and boring,Kinda boring. Sad too how boring it was. The music is not up to par with other films of its type and age
4,A fascinating story about a fascinating man.,"Catilina lives in Roman legends something like Richard III does in English legends. Saylor has presented a wonderful picture of the man as seen through the eyes of his hero Gordianus. This is a must-read book for Roman history buffs. The only complaint that I had with the book was the extended political monologues that appear throughout, but even in these Saylor brings his characters to life. It is interesting to meet a young Julius Caesar too. There's everything in this book - a mystery, a history lesson, a Roman battle, and lots of Roman politics and spymaking. Ssylor brings his world to life, and I absolutely love his characters. At the end of this book Gordianus is 51 years old. My only concern is that he's getting old too fast and the series will have to end long before I'm ready for it to."
3,politics and long winded speeches,"Overall, I did like this book (I finished it). I enjoyed the mystery, the Finder's family life and the description of life in the country. However, the politics did make it drag on occasion. There is always some exposition in Saylor's books, and I usually don't mind it because I like to learn more about the context and about Rome during this period of time. But in this book the exposition regarding the politics drags. It doesn't help that he includes transcripts of the speeches, either. Yikes. I can barely stand to listen to contemporary political speeches, let alone read ancient ones. This part of the book definitely could have been tightened up. I skimmed over most of it until it got back to the story. It was a good Kindle book, by which i mean that typos are rare and did not interfere with my enjoyment."
3,A Mystery from Ancient History,"Catilina's Riddle is a delightful blend of the historical fiction and ""whodunit"" murder mystery genres. Saylor takes time in developing complex characters, provoking the marble effigies of toga-clad senators to speak. His book stands as evidence that political intrigue is as ancient as murder. As a mystery it is better than some, though don't expect the plot-twisting mastery of Dame Agatha. As historical fiction, the well- researched novel packs more history per square inch than most novels on the market. It is a good, though lengthy read: recommended."
5,Dancin in the Traffic!,"I love the vocals with the dance music! It's a great ""Pick Me Up"" in the slow moving car!"
1,Wasn't for us...,The stand seemed... well... rickety. It was too short to use on our chameleon cage. The stand was tipsy and seemed cheaply made. Not for us. You would likely need to attach it to the side of a cage to get it to be steady.
3,Not very tall,"Dont get me wrong, I blame myself for not finding out the dimensions first but my terrarium for my Chameleon is not very tall but this stand will not work at all. It is way too short. I am trying to figure out how to rig the dang thing. Make sure you read the dimensions first!"
2,not what I thought I was ordering,"This product would've been fine if I knew it was just a stand and not a lamp... guess it was my own fault because it did say "" lamp stand"" on it.. but the picture of the lamp got me..lol Must say that I returned this item back to Amazon and it was easy and they had the money back in my account quick with no hassle!!! That is why I continue to use Amazon!"
3,Keeps the Cage Warm/Good Longevity,I use mine as a 24 hour heat source and my previous two lasted between five and six months. Not to shabby for the money. I'm heating a 55g tank pairing the incandescent with an undertank pad and it gives me a solid 90 degrees near the bottom.Edit: Most recent bulb lasted less than 1500 hours. I will update my feedback for the next one.
1,Discription incorrect!,I ordered this item in a rush when I was leaving for vacation. The titles on the item description and image do not match. I needed a 50W bulb and received a 75W one which overheated my gecko's tank to an extreme. The gecko lived but only because I have an intelligent and observant pet sitter. Unfortunately she threw away the packaging so I doubt there's anything I can do. If you're looking for a 75W bulb this one probably works fine.
5,Seeking to set the stage for an informed and reasonable dial,"The collaborative translation and editorial effort of Daniel Cozort (Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Religion at Dickinson College) and Craig Preston (a private teacher of Classical Tibetan and Buddhist Philosophy in Ithaca, New York), Losang Gonchok's Short Commentary To Jamyang Shayba's Root Text On Tenets is an involved study by Tibetan writer Jamyang Shayba on the key differences between the major schools of Buddhist philosophy. Seeking to set the stage for an informed and reasonable dialogue between different manners of thought, individual chapters pay especial attention to ""The Clear Crystal Mirror"" and Losang Gonchok's attending views of a wide variety of schools. An in-depth study and technical study, Buddhist Philosophy is highly recommended for advanced students and academic scholars of Buddhism."
2,Off the mark,The text was meant to be complemented by a DVD and not a CD. Therefore the fast paced instructions and excellent audio quality of the CD fall short.Remember the adage a picture is worth... If you can mentally picture the instructions then this affordable combination might be for you. The pace is very demanding for a starter.JB
2,Not Good Enough,i thought this book was very confussing. I got this book when i recieved my guitar. This book was not detailed and i had a hard time. I am now reading Guitar for Dummies and i learned much more easily.
5,Please,"They are white 6' tables and they hold things off of the floor. As long as they came unbroken and continue to hold things off the floor, I'm happy."
1,Would not reccomend,"This is as listed: a cheap product. The back on this when used as a sofa shifts everywhere and does not stay in place. When laying on it as a bed there is a vertical bar that digs into your back. Checked instructions twice and this is how it's supposed to be. The frame on the seat broke after four months of use, and I'm not a particularly heavy person.Would only recommend as a seldom-used spare bed. Ok for the cost, but don't expect much."
3,is not pure beeswax,"I was not careful when buying this product. I read 100% pure beeswax on the label, but missed the ""with"" that comes before it in smaller type size. Unless enlarged, the ""with"" is very small to read.The Amazon caption for this product also reads: ""Murray's Natural Beeswax"" and that is misleading because it contains other ingredients.I don't know how much actual beeswax it contains - I would guess between a quarter and a third.The remaining ingredient is petrolatum (petroleum jelly) if memory serves.I bought it to make homemade zinc oxide diaper cream - and despite not being pure beeswax, the cream turned out ok."
4,Murray's Natural Beeswax,I bought this product to twist my son hair although it takes a good washing to get out it work great for me my next choice will be the Murray's Black Beeswax Thanks Amazon
2,Not very useful or interesting,"This really is a 'pocket' guide. It is a tiny little thing that can easily fit into the back pocket of a pair of jeans with plenty of room to spare. I would like to be able to say that this tiny book is packed with information but, sadly, this is not the case. There are a few pages at the start giving some general, but pretty sketchy, information about the 'dim sum' experience, and then 40 odd separate pages each showing a picture of a common dim sum dish along with the English name, Chinese characters and the Cantonese transliteration. Not only is Pinyin not included but there isn't any sort of description or other interesting information about the dish in question. On the whole I found it very disappointing and not worth the ten or so dollars I paid for it."
2,Did not notice that it was bent right a way.,"It work great, but is dented on the threads of the piece that holds the screen so leaks a little from there."
3,Package is MIA,Ordered this item and it was to deliver on 7/31....8 days later it is still MIA and the only tracking information is that it has left. I can't get to any live person or even an e-mail to get assistance. Granddaugher's birthday present very late!
3,It's a fun game,"OK, my main beef with this game is the extremely lame voice acting. Lame, lame, lame. Laughable, really.Other than that, the game is fun to play. Good graphics, great sound effects, easy to learn combat and spell system. Lots of cool weapons and armor you can customize."
1,False Advertisement,"I don't much like making negative reviews but this game hyped up a lot more than it actually dished out.Horrendous graphics even with a nice machine, frames would drop around more than three simultaneous enemies. Broken gameplay and even more broken quests and combat is plain awful. The claim was ""Most Epic RPG of all time!"" however after seventeen hours of this garbage it has nothing to show for it.I apologize to the developer who probably had positive intentions, but the only thing this game can claim to be epic, is failure. If you are looking at this game after coming from The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion you will not find a good game in Two Worlds.Try Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Age of Conan:Hyborian Adventures, Oblivion, or Fable: The Lost Chapters before you waste your game time with this rush-released trash."
4,10 Minutes!,"The main reason I use this product is because of the fast timing, Ok, not exactly 10 minutes but shorter than all the other permanent dyes. Although I'm only 39 (wink-wink), that darn grey hair at the temples is so stubborn and fast growing I need a touch-up every 10 days! The ratio of color to developer is 1:1; I use small equal quantities of each so the package lasts at least 4-6 times. (Obviously separate mixing and application method need to be employed.) The product is non-runny, and close in color to the pics. There is a broader color range than similar products that are targeted just for regrowth (Clairol). I think it's a good product but I use it off-brand,differently than manufacturer's suggestions."
4,Nice Gypsy Jazz,"A departure from his more mainstream jazz CDs, Campbell's musicality still shines through.Also a rare chance to hear Campbell on acoustic guitar."
5,New prospective on living,I really enjoy reading this easy to read book. It gave me a great outlook on life and let me know it's us to me and God to bring joy to my life. Loved the stories and advice on how to live a joyful life.
4,Satisfying,"Admittedly, I am a late comer to the Carlotta series, but this was one of my favorites. This particular plot forced Carlotta to face her past and exposed some uncomfortable feelings - jealousy of Dee. The interaction with her ex was necessary and helped her come to terms with her current feelings. I thought it was a very moving story with a very poignant ending."
2,like an OPRAH show... in book form,"Only Oprah would do a better job of telling us HOW our neighbors/siblings/co-workers can afford their lifestyle. I picked this book up after I read the review in Publishers Weekly. To sum up the contents, it's a compilation of stories about couples and real estate and credit card debt and the secrets we keep when it comes to how people REALLY afford that brand new minivan, the designer purse, the private school for their kids. Unfortunately there was nothing new in this book... I mean, yeah, big deal, everyone has a second mortgage these days, right? No epiphanal moments or breakthroughs into inside information and the root of envy. But the concept of this book is great and the author has done a terrific job of trying to make money talk not quite so taboo. Kudos to her for that. The subject would make a great topic for an Oprah Winfrey show."
3,"A good, semi-scholarly work","This work, while apparently well researched, can only be classified as semi-scholarly. There are simply too many places where footnotes are needed to establish references. One could also have hoped for more discussion of the religious implications of androgyny and asexuality in the ancient world."
2,Reverse David Irving,"Much of what Fischer claims about Nazi Germany has been discounted by legitimate historians. For example, the Lebensborn program was not a stud farm for SS supermen and Nordic women to create a new master race, and Ilse Koch did not create lampshades and book covers from the skin of dead Jews.Every significant figure in the Nazi regime, even those who ultimately had little to do with the persecution and destruction of the Jews in Europe, is portrayed as either a sexual deviant or a sociopath. I seriously doubt the most educated people in Europe would have tolerated such a regime long enough for it to plunge Europe into its most destructive war.I guess surrendering historical objectivity is a small price to pay to make money and avoid being bullied by the ADL."
2,Halo Reparative Shampoo,"This shampoo smells terrific, it lathers beautifully, however, for me, it stripped the color from my hair and was too oily. This shampoo would be great for someone with dry hair who doesn't use color. It is obviously for someone with damaged hair and was not what I needed.It is a reparative shampoo, but I thought it might be the old Halo formula and that's why I purchased it. For those who remember Halo Shampoo from the past, this is not the same product."
3,"Set is okay, but it has the worst grater","Over all the set is fine and useable with one glaring exception - the cheese grater is cheap and poorly designed. I attempted to use it once on some asiago (not the hardest cheese either) and it barely grated anything; the metal began bending and it would have broken had i continued. Many of the tiny bits it actually did grate became gummed up in the overlapping plastic frame.If you need a cheese grater this set is not a good deal, the grater is a total waste in my opinion."
2,The designer had to be a GIANT!!!,"These tools are HUGE!! No really I'm not exaggerating, they are very BIG! And they fall out of every pan I have except for the big ol' stock pots or dutch ovens, but who's gonna use non-stick in those anyway.. I guess if you are a teflon- a -holic, and you even buy those non-stick.Other than them being huge they are okay, they are heat resistant.I kept them because I basically got'em for FREE! I store them in the drawer they are not really used. They are not for me, my husband reaches for them more than me.Too awkward and clunky. 2 stars"
1,Not for the Real Martial Arts Student,"First off, if you like sensationalist writing or wild claims, you will probably enjoy this book. Likewise, if you are a new martial art student, it does give you some new ways to think in different situations. That said, you should know I am a third degree brown belt myself (testing for my first dan or degree of black within a few months.) Some of what he writes is disparingly obvious - for example, did you know an AXE can be used as a weapon? Or a rifle can be used for a club once you run out of ammunition? Other points he makes can be dangerous if you tried to rely on them in a real-world application. For example, he writes how he deterred an attack by giving the aggressor an menacing stare. However, if you are able to maintain a skeptical viewpoint and really think about some of his suggestions, there are a few interesting points."
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoy all the Cats on Here.some of the Baddest Session Cats in the Game,but that doesn't always translates into making albums on yourself&for a few ALbums Fourplay seemed trapped.but this album seems like a burst of fresh air musically on quite a few tracks.digging the vibe overall on tracks here compared to there past few albums.a welcome return."
4,Who wouldn't like a happy little bunny?,"Even if you don't like the sentiment, the bunny is so darned cute! I really like Happy Bunny, and sometimes the sentiments make me laugh (to myself when I shouldn't and out loud when no one else is around).Such a naughty little bunny!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The title delineates a role that Severian, whose memoirs these bookspurport to be, must play. It is an office of duty. Being a torturer andexecutioner, he is called upon to kill yet another woman, He refusesone of these due to emotion, and has to leave."
3,Going good but still have questions,Things are going great with training my two year old to potty. I feel like it is mostly because she was the one that showed interest and I just went along. But I am having a hard time getting her to poop in the potty. I KNOW she needs to go because she comes to me and asks for a diaper so she can go. Although I agree with everything the book says I feel like it is too short and doesn't contain enough information. I have a lot of unanswered questions.
1,Fast delivery of a useless oil cap.,"Do not trust if the site tells you that this will fit your vehicle. I purchased one of these caps for my Mazda, and it came too short even when it told me that it will fit. I think they just set it up like that since returning it would be more expensive and inconvenient than taking the hit on it.....scam."
5,An AMAZING cd!,"I found out about Amos Lee while watching TV and seeing him on a 15 second commericial, hadn't heard of him before that. I went straight to Amazon to check out the reviews and ratings to see what he was about. To sum it up, he*is*very*cool!This is an amazing cd. Other's have compared his soulful lyrics to a male version of Norah Jones. I agree. His lyrics are moving, they relax me, they make me want to dance and smile. His words make you think about your life - where you've been & where you want to go. That's when you know you've made a great cd!I wish nothing but the best for Amos Lee and whatever the future may hold for him."
3,OLD BLIND HECK,THE CD WAS SHIPPED AS INDICATED. THE SONG THAT I GOT WAS NOT THE ONE I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT STILL ENJOYED LISTENING TO MUSIC FROM 1926. THE RECORD THAT I LISTENED TO WHEN I WAS 5 WAS ON A ONE SIDE 78 RECORD AND WAS AN INSTRIMENTAL. ON THE RECORD THE ONLY NAME ON THE RECORD WAS OLD BLIND . IT WAS ONE OF THE 78S THAT MY UNCLE LEFT AT MY GRANDMOTHERS WHEN HE WENT INTO THE SEABEES WWII. THE RECORDS THAT THERE WERE BLUES AND WESTERN SWING/
4,I liked this movie when I was a kid,We just bought a GSD and I wanted my son to see this movie. Jerry Lee reminds him of our dog. My husband likes this movie too.
4,I really like the case,The case is very good not too bulky and it allows you to throw it in your pocket. It is durable but if you drop it it splits and the phone pops out and hits the ground. That is the only downfall. Easy fix is dont drop it too often.
1,Simplistic and unidimensional.,"The writer has based his opinions on mid-20th century concepts of humanism and development. Had he bothered to engage more contemporary theological ideas, or to look more deeply into the current dialogues between quantum science and religion, his conclusions would have to have been very different. What the description claims is ""a whole new light"" is really same-old same old, tired and relatively naive -- and ponderously written to boot. Sorry. Skip this one."
5,Thought provoking,"A must read for all God-fearing people. This book is a courageous exspose` of thoughts which many people have, but are afraid to express."
3,if you expect a thriller you'll be disappointed,"i opened this book based on somebody's recommendation that it was a terrific court room thriller. not true! snow falling may be exceptional in some respects (nicely written, very vivid sense of place and time) but thrilling it is not. john grisham would have told this story in about 100 pages."
1,Annoying,"I got extremely annoyed with all the stereotype description of the characters. David Gutterson tries to lengthen the very thin base of the novel (the murder and the accusation) with unnecessary long memories, detailed description of strawberry fields and snow falling. And I thought it was very irritating the way he switched from the memories of all the different characters. I think he wrote the novel with the intention of getting it filmed. I thought it was a waste of my time but I wanted to finish it anyway (which is the one positive thing I can say about the book)"
5,A Classic,"I first got a glance of Snow Falling on Cedars off my teachers list of options for our independent novel project. The Title of the novel intrigued me; however the book was little on the lengthy side so I was a little skeptical about reading it. But that all changed after I read the first page. I couldn't put the book down. It has a perfect blend of history, romance, lies, and a lot of suspense. Gusterson takes you back 60 years ago to a little island before, after, and during World War II. Emotions run high as a large percentage of the population is Japanese; in a time where they were not the most wanted people in the US, after Pearl Harbor and all. The majority of the novel takes place during a mans trial for murder. But it is intertwined with everything that lead to him being their. I would recommend this book to anyone, so please read it!"
4,"This book is an eye catcher, and a great seller.","This was a great book. It tells how a Japanese American is judged by an whole island. The Japanese American, Kabuo Miyamoto, is being charged of a fisherman's murder. I like how the story first takes place in the courtroom. While I was reading it, I felt if I was watching it on television. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat making you read more into the book. This book is a mystery, a thriller, and love story wrapped into one novel. If you like mysteries and you want to find out the truth of the murder, then I really think you should read this book."
1,"lies, lies, and more damn lies (suggested title)","i battled with this book and finally, after about 15 tries, made it all the way through it, although i am not sure i am any better for it. i had to slowly drag myself through half the book before i actually began to take even a slight interest in it. i still don't see how it merits the acclaim it has somehow garnered."
2,Not impressed,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I felt the plotline was thin and there wasn't much depth. I know the overall reaction to this book is of a superior nature, but I was positively underwhelmed."
4,Snow Falling on Cedars is more than a mystery,"Snow Falling on Cedars is a history of past events that the characters went though years before the trial. Much of the reading covers events that tie all of the characters together. All of these characters meet at the trial to find out the fate of Kabuo. The story takes many sudden turns, but it does seem to start slow. Only read this book if you have a lot of time to spare and an interest in mysteries."
3,snow falling on cedars,"This book is a best seller written by David Guterson. it is a murder mystery that takes place in a place called Amity Island. a local fisherman was found dead one morning tangled up in his fishing nets with a bad head injury. everyone was quick to blame another fisherman named kabuo miyamoto. there was a lot of racial tension on the island and everyone thinks it is him no matter what. ishmael has loved kabuos wife, hatsue since they were kids. she coldly told him that they could not see each other anymore and she was quick to move on but ishmael never got over her. the whole story is told through mostly flashbacks. it is kind of confusing and hard to follow but for the most part it is not too bad. the book overall is not to bad but it drags on a little bit and is sort of confusing and the end it terrible."
3,_Snow Falling on Cedars_: A Review by T. Ivey,"This book is written so that its reader feels, at times, as though a observer in the book. For example, in one scene, the author makes you feel like you are actually in the autopsy room with the corpse, as the words are graphic and explicit. And so is the language, and the sex scenes between two ""consenting"" teens.Because of some of the language and sex scenes, I do not recommend this book for teen-agers. One of the characters, Hatsue, appears very angry at life and at Ishmael, someone she was very ""close"" with earlier in her life.(Remember the sex scenes I mentioned?) In Herman Melville's novel _Moby Dick_ he starts off his with this famous line, ""Call me Ishmael."" In this book, however, the very-married Hatsue seems to be saying to a man (Ishmael) who is not her husband, ""Call me, Ishmael."""
2,A matter of region,"It is interesting to see that most of the negative comments were written by New Yorkers and people from Massachussetts. Should that mean that educated people from that side of the country have developed a more acute critical mind? Well, for sure, they are far more down-to-earth and skeptical, and the beauty of the descriptions in Snow Falling on Cedars didn't touch them as it did to more sensitive readers. Nonetheless, good book or not, it has given way to a marvelous film. For that, credit needs be given to the author, and praise, to the film producer."
2,Children's Book,"Don't make the mistake I did and buy this book thinking it's for adults. This is a one hundred page edited version for children still learning how to read books. The real Snow Falling on Cedars is closer to 400 pages. Therefore, though it covers the story, this is not an appropriate book for an adult, and you can't really see the talent of the author."
5,Differrent,"I was actually forced to read this in my English class, and initially thought it was dull. After sometime I went back to read it over, and it is now one of my all time favorite books. Its great, now I have to see the movie!"
4,Very Moving,"I read the book ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" for my 8th grade literature class in which we had to choose to read a historical fiction novel. I got into it, and soon enough, I was almost finished! It was a very powerful story which deals with the discrimination of the Japanese during and after the second World War. A Japanese man is on trial for the murder of an American man, and a very interesting case comes into play. One by one, you learn about the characters' pasts and how they are all connected to someone else's: sometimes in more ways than one. The connections aren't always good ones, and it shows you how some events really do come back to haunt you. David Guterson really kept me in this book, and his enticing storyline really gave me a lot to think about. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn a little about life and about the past during a time when all men weren't thought to be created equal."
2,P.C. hype leaves everything to be desired...,"I had ""heard"" that the book was an excellent must read. I was disappointed not only by the slowness of the story itself, but by the redundancy of the text. He has many descriptions which I felt were goobledegook attempting to hide a weak story. The book could easily have been 100 pages with nothing lost. Gutterson seemed detached from his characters, a writer merely describing thoughts, feeling, emotions etc. which made me feel detached from the characters, as well as the story. It's interesting to see how one good review can often times illicit an emperor's new clothes mentality. There are so many excellent books out there, this is not one I would have spent valuable time reading had I read an accurate review. I finished it because I had high hopes it would improve based on inaccurate word of mouth and reviews."
4,Something for Everyone...and more,"Snow Falling on Cedars was greeted by mixed enthusiasm by the members of The Companionable Readers Bookclub. Some of us were eager for a good old fashioned murder mystery, while others were concerned for their fine sensibilities. What a surprise we got! Snow Falling on Cedars has it all: the tragic death of a local fisherman, a gritty courtroom drama, an inter-cultural struggle for acceptance, an unrequited love, a gripping ""locked room"" puzzle, a town torn apart by war, and a solid marriage shaken the accusation of murder. Want more? Read this book. It is elegant, beautiful and picturesque. We did find it a little slow moving in places, and a few of our readers struggled to keep up with the times (leaping around as it does!), but on the whole, it is a moving story of three men, irretrievably altered by the influence of war, and the tragic intersection of their lives and cultures. Highly recommended by our readers!"
2,"No, Snow falling on cedars","Haunting......A whodunit complete with courtroom maneuvering and surprising turns of evidence and at the same time a mystery, something altogether richer and deeperThis book had something for every body. Of course it did! it had too it is a best selling novel, built lets really look into this book. It is just like every other Love suspense thriller. It had its typical characters.....well the typical is fine but you should have the smarts to jazz this characters up a bit. Then the plot was a typical edge of your sit, heart throbbing story....or was it you could predict the story. There was not much point to read this book besides improve your reading skills and use up time. This book was quite the trend.Author of book: David Guterson"
2,The story is so wordy and repetitive. Overrated!,"Although a few interesting characters are developed, the author's pace is painstakingly slow and repetitive. I skimmed the book, finished it in a couple of days, and didn't feel that I missed anything. The prose is not so wonderful as to be forgiving of the author's verbosity. The plot line is also not strong enough to hold the reader's interest. Ismahal's torch for the defendant's wife is also a bit unbelieveable."
3,a book for patient readers,"Prepare for a long journey through a time of many prejudices and upsetting rememberances through one of our nations most mournful times--the war between Japan and the U.S. This novel not only touches the hearts of many, but allows us to have first-hand experiences of the Japanese during this terrible war. I give it 3 stars."
3,Review snow falling on cedars,"In my opinion ""Snow falling on cedars "" is a really good book. It includs a love and a crime story , which both are very exciting. The conflict between the Japanese and the Americans is also a really interesting aspect. Although the Japanese , who lived in the USA, supported them in World War II , were treated very bad and everybody avoided them. The only things I disliked were the detailed descriptions of the landscape in San Piedro. Often it was very borring to read this parts and so you have to overjump them. All in all I would suggest people to read this book and to watch the movie, because it's being worth"
3,The words went together well.,"The story makes a fine mystery, but little else.My sister was convinced that my father would not like thisbook. I am not enamored of it, and I am not convinced thatany Japanese-American male will really enjoy it. Considerthis: the Japanese-American males are two-dimensional propsin this story. Where are their true emotions? The real characters are the white males andan Asian female. Everyone else is superficial. The writingis well done, but I think that this book is just a goodmystery and does not deserve to be called ""literature."" Iwonder why it has won any awards at all, except maybe the""Edgar."""
5,Theis book gets better and better,"After reading positive review after positive review about this book, I finally picked it up. And I'm glad I did. But, to be honest, I thought the book was overrated after the first 50 pages and questioned the hype. Then, like a turbo engine, it took off! Eventually, I could not put the book down and could not wait for the trial to end so that I could see the verdict. The author's description of the locale and the era are excellent! He certainly conveyed the uneasy feeling of being Japanese-American during World War II. But he did it in such a way (the trial and the love story) that we take it to heart. Read the reviews of this book and understand that it's THAT good!"
2,ZZZ....,"What? Huh? Oh I just woke up. I was reading Snow Falling on Cedars and must have fallen asleep. I thought it would be a great book. Also, because it was set in a place where I grew up, I was very excited to have it brought to national attention. However, this book was slow from the very beginning, and it never got better. I kept reading thinking ""it has to get better"", but it never did. The whole premise of race relations was lost in the long winded character descriptions and flashbacks. I did enjoy the ""solving of the mystery"", but I certainly wasn't convinced about character relations. I need to visualize a character in order to get into a book, and despite my best attempts, I never could visualize or get into any of the characters in the book. If you want something to put you to sleep, this book and a cup of warm milk should do it!"
2,He didn't want to waste the research!,"It seems that Guterson did a lot of research for this novel and was reluctant to ""waste"" any of it. The point, surely, is to use only what you need. The few brushtrokes of traditional Japanese drawing: economical and sure, seem an apt comparison here. It's repetitive, it has a made-for-Hollywood ending, but underneath all that a good editor could find an excellent novella."
2,Guterson himself has not departed from racial biases.,"Yes, this was a well-crafted book. However, it was not _well-written_ because Guterson utilized ""essentialist"" words to describe Asian American qualities in his book. Let me explain. Did you notice that Guterson used words such as ""grace,"" ""tranquility,"" and ""patience"" to describe Asian Americans? He also used telling phrases such as ""his strength...an inward matter"" (87) or ""I understand just now the deepest beauty"" (92) in order to capture the seemingly essential, or ""primary,"" qualities exuded by Asian Americans. Look throughout the book: Does Guterson ever use these types of words to describe the non-Asian population of San Piedro Island? Guterson himself has not departed from racial biases."
5,"A book ""banned"" (in a ""free"" society) is a ""must read""!","Book Banned, Teacher Blamed - (BOERNE) -- School officials in Boerne have banned a popular book after a high school English teacher assigned it to her classes. Principal Sam Champion says ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" contains graphic violence, racial bigotry, and depictions of sex. Champion says the teacher who assigned the book is being disciplined. He says Boerne is a conservative community. He adds there are plenty of great books available for his English students. The novel is about a Japanese-American charged with murdering a fisherman in Washington state in the fifties."
3,"A Faulkner Award? Against What, The Cat in the Hat?","I can't imagine how a novel so obviously flawed made its way onto the AP reading list and further won a Faulkner Award (although the Faulkner Award isn't anything great).Take the overused and redundant theme of racism, a bunch of stereotypical characters, awkward and annoying symbolism, and a variety of out-of-place sexual acts and you've got the sown together Frankenstein mess of this book. My teacher said that Guterson was influenced strongly by To Kill a Mockingbird, yet that is an extreme understatement. Guterson practically copied the book's central themes and added his own twisted workings to create a piece of ... at which we should all scoff.Unless you like chapter after chapter of scenes of masturbation and erectile dysfunction in a 79-year-old man (both of which suggest some of Guterson's obsesions), don't buy this book. Save your time, money, and sanity."
3,Don't buy the hype--this one's no classic,"This book is definitely a quick read, but the prose gets way too heavy after a while (yes, yes, mimicking the snow, but its gets SO old...) And I totally agree that the end is a yawn, and leaves a lot of loose ends. And the characters don't really ever seem to change. This book is long on description and short on characterization.How can this be best summarized? A rich man's supermarket pageturner, and a poor man's serious novel.... This doesn't make it bad, it just makes it overrated compared to its enthusiastic reviews.(As for Guterson, he has promise. He's a step above the Clancys, but he has a ways to go to reach the likes of DeLillo, Vonnegut, and Morrison.)"
3,A Painful Read,"Guterson doesn't want to let you go...he grabs you by the throat, and you're in pain, but it's too fascinating to stop reading. Of course, you come to realize his art is imitating life--its reality, its principles of pain and suffering. He slowly, meticulously, exposes a series of injustices and misery: prejudice, the horrors of war, undisguised hatred; and he leaves it up to us whether any light shows through all this dark. A great read, Snow Falling On Cedars will change you--if you let it. P.S. Those with weak stomachs should not read the detailed autopsy which encompasses chapter 5!"
5,my personal highlight in 1998,"a pageturner, a book to dive in, dream away, go back to 1954 and more, learn about the relationship between Americans and Japanese-Americans before, during and after WW II."
3,These book is good for people with different cases,I think the book was confusing and some of the book was interesting on the murder of Carl Heine. I think a lot of people is going to read this book. You got to write a lot of names in notes to remember this stuff and you write a lot of the case.
3,Too many characters to follow,There were too many characters to follow and frankly I did not find the book to hold my attention. I read it for book club or I would not have finished it.
4,Vivid descriptions,"I had seen the movie several years ago and the book was far superior to the movie. I really enjoyed the vivid descriptions of the scenery, the people, the events, etc. I could almost experience the cold and snow in the winter storm I also enjoyed the author'ssharing insights into the thoughts of the characters."
2,Deserving but not for everyone,"Don't Don't Don't read this book for the plot--because there really isn't much of one. YOu could really summarize the key points of the story in about three sentences(I don't want to spoil the book by doing it). While others reviewers have stated that the book is rich in characters, I would tend to disagree. I found the characters stale,very one-dimensional and totally predictable. Especially Hatsue, who had no personality whatsoever.The saving grace of this book is the atmosphere, Guterson is clearly from this area and truly brings it alive for the reader. However, my last negative :)--it's not for weak readers, the language is dense and hard to get through at times."
3,Snow Falling on Cedars or Me Falling Asleep,"Perhaps it's my wavering attention span but David Guterson's elegant prose failed to engage even the romantic in me. As deliberate as his descriptions are of San Pedro island and its many inhabitants, Guterson wavers from his story for far too long. There are strong elements in this book that hold it together but the plodding pace and unecessary elaborations ultimately weigh it down."
2,Plot and Character Take a Snow Day,"Alright, so the novel started out promising. Hissing courtroom heaters, impending doom, and all that snow. But then.... If you love snow, then this is the novel for you. If you're more interested in character and plot development then I suggest something else. Before long I realized that I was reading a sappy romance novel; a Harlequin without the steamy sex. The moral dilemma facing the narrator arrives suddenly, about two-thirds of the way through this slushy novel, and seems forced. It's as if Guterson's first draft was sent back from his editor with a note saying: ""Add something interesting. Anything. Please! "" And so he tried. And so he failed..."
4,Compelling reading,"A love story told in flashbacks from a murder trial? Yes, and it works! It is so fully and richly written, you truly feel you know these people.I know some reviewers thought it had too much description and too many flashbacks, but I felt that is what made it so real. Knowing the background of the main characters;their families, their histories, help you understand who they are now, and why they behave as they do.I admit I think we could have done without SO much insight into the defense attorney's private thoughts, but overall I found the background information very helpful in understanding the characters and how they interact with each other. It is a story that should make us exam our own background and prejudices to see why we make the decisions we make and why we believe what we do. Very compelling reading. Hard to put down."
4,"This Book is a vivid, but unprententious, trip to another land.","Ok, here is my take on this book. It is a very, very good book. Not great, but very good. Is this alright? Well, it is alright because too many novels acclaimed by many of the experts are way too obtuse and make too many negative assumptions about the motives of most people. This book acclaimed by experts as great is about as close to that label as I think is possible. Why? The book presents a story, characters, and images that are all within the reach of most everyday places in the US. Most other hyped novels are so far beyond the realm of the normal that this book might look a little bland in comparison. However, this is a just an image of blandness. The book is something more, it something remarkable that could have happened in the more boring modern world. Anyway, get this book and enjoy a vivid image and good story, characters."
2,It's been done many times before,"Coming to this site, I am pleased to see that my opinion about this book doesn't stand alone. I don't see why this book has received the accolades it has. The plot itself is manageable enough, but I think that the writer's style was deliberate and slow to the point where I felt he became TOO conscious of his technique, and this became apparent on paper. It wasn't until I was already 150 pages into the book that I determined that I had read too much to simply toss it aside, and that for the sake of the Pen/Faulkner award it garnered, I should try to read it to completion. Now I wonder why I did. I guess the love story was compelling/sad in that manufactured kind of way, but this coupled with the author's contrived style ( of long, rambling descriptions) made it all feel a bit too force-fed."
4,My heart aches......,This book was so da*n sad my hurt aches for the main characters...wishing i could've changed their fate. Despite of it's drawbacks SFOC is a really good novel good interesting plot that keeps you going. The melding of the past and present was like a to be continued kinda thing. And the writing was one of the best ones i've come across to in ages. I read this book about a week ago but i still think about it every book i pick up i keep comparing it to SFOC the prose as somebody said is like poetry....
4,Just Lovely!,"What is going on with all the complaining about this book? It was wonderful! Guterson does an outstanding job rendering his characters and bringing the island of San Piedro to life. Granted, this may not be a ""plot"" book (though it certainly kept me turning pages!), but I found joy in his sensitive expression of the strengths, weaknesses, and ultimately the humanity of his characters. Very enjoyable!"
5,This book is simply astonishing,"I have read this book and I found out that I've never read something as amazing as this. For those who like religion stuff, this is the best book in the market on Spiritual Authority, angels' and man's creation and satan's fall.Just amazing!!!"
3,Not so comfortable,"I bought this product based on my experience with prevoius Evenflo products. As long as materials and finishing the quality is there. Nevertheless the design is troublesome, specially for the baby. When i seated my son with his back against my chest the top edge of the carrying ""harness"" was against his face making it very uncomfortable for him. I tryed the three vertical adjustments to fix the problem without success, the only position to keep the baby was face to face."
4,100 words are mine,I'm planning a trip to Rome and this book did just what it said it would ; give me a basic vocabulary of 100 (mostly nouns) words. It didn't include numbers or colors nor were their any verbs. I used it along with Learn Italian in 10 Minutes a Day. I am thinking of using the format (flashcards and worksheets) to teach my Spanish Speaking students in Panama 100 words in English before they go into 7th grade.
3,John Lithgow as I've never seen him!,"Great film from Brian DePalma, about mulitple personalities and childhood trauma. John Lithgow was great, although I did notice the acting was a bit overdone at times. Great camera work, it really set the mood for this movie and I recommend it, although it's not something I'd watch more then once."
1,THE TRAILER'S GREAT BUT THE MOVIE AINT,"John Lithgow was great in the film but the other characters were so insipid, vapid and stupid that by the end of the movie you were praying for the serial killer to wipe them all out in a painful and greusome fashion."
5,I must say for the price I am in LOVE!,I must say for the price I am in LOVE! I had leaky faucets and I am a renter that likes to fix things faster than the landlord. I got my hot water working now :) Just be gentle with the handles because the construction is lightweight. Nothing wrong with going cheap sometimes and this is one of them! Same quality as $50 faucets for WAY CHEAPER. I got the bathroom faucet also at the same time and now both my sinks are functional for under $35! I am super happy. I will update this review if they break at all. I think if they last for a couple years without leaking they are worth it. The last faucet I had lasted 2 months before it broke and it was $80 at the local hardware store.
4,Smooth water!,"While the faucet is made of a hard plastic, and seems easy to break, I have loved it. The installation was easy, the hose works fine, and the water comes out smooth!Good buy for the money."
1,Broken within few month.,I used it only few few months. It broken. Just wonder who to turn to to get it fixed or returned.
5,The Gang's All Here,"This Monopoly set is perfect for anyone who has fond memories of the comic strip Peanuts. As you travel around the board, you can buy the classic characters (Peppermint Patty and Marcy to Pig Pen, Woodstock, and Snoopy) or locations and situations (the pumpkin patch or kicking the football). Probably my favorite change is the railroads, which are now holidays (must own Christmas). The tokens include Lucy's psychiatric booth, Schroeder's piano, and Woodstock. And Snoopy adorns all the money. Even the font used on the title deed cards imitates the style of printing used in the strip for 50 years.As others have noted, the ""nests"" and ""doghouses"" look remarkably like houses and hotels. While a little disappointing, it doesn't dampen my enjoyment of this incarnation of the classic board game."
2,Grater Broke,I bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle. This implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design.
3,Pretty good,"It's a nice set and matched very well to the rest of my red kitchen decor. I use the spatula, the can opener and the potato peeler the most. The grater is a little too fine for cheeses and it is a pain to wash it, so I never rarely every use it. The ice cream scoop proved useless to me because I don't eat ice cream. And the mixer was sometimes useful to mix eggs or marinades. Now the only complain I have is about the spatula. I left it a couple of times on the side of a heated pan, and the pan's edge melted a crease in the spatula's handle. I know, it's now safe to leave cooking utensils like that, but I am still not happy that a utensil that is meant to be used on a heated stove will melt plastic onto the pan!"
5,"Another World By the Sea, In the Sea, Under the Sea","Her writing style is from another era; her time in the 'novel' is from another era; if you accept that, you will probably enter that era. The truth(s) written as a novel. Enjoy it, if you dare to buy it."
4,Pretty good product,"I recently moved and my new living arrangements are short on closet space. I purchased this so I wouldn't have to keep my clothing in boxes. The rack is very sturdy and pretty easy to move about. With the use of cascading wardrobe hangers, I am allow to hang a lot of clothes and many of them are heavy like suits and thicker winter work pants. The clothes definitely weigh over 150 pounds. I like the height of the unit; it makes everything hang at an easy viewing area. The unit did not come with directions but was assembled in under a half hour. I wish it came with the extra piece that allows for shoe storage (it can be purchased separately) - that would have made this the perfect unit. Good buy. I would recommend."
5,JMC,"This is a heavy duty clothes rack and holds lots of clothing. It was very easy to put together and also easy to take apart to move, if you would need to move to another floor. I would buy this rack again."
4,Thank you!,"The ONLY improvement in this book (in my opinion) would be a guide to pronunciation (long vowel, short, etc.).Thank you for giving me insight to some of the stories and customs of my grandmother...some of which my mother carries on to this day."
5,Genius,"Could barely get in my car's CD player fast enough the day I got it! As I type, I keep telling myself this is an album review, not an artist review... But yeah, basically all that manifests from M.A.N.D.Y. does not ever, & I mean EVER disappoint. I have found that unlike many artists, if you like one of M.A.N.D.Y.'s albums, you will love them all. Always brilliant, deep, avant-garde tech house.Buy it. You will love. :)"
1,Worked great at first and then nosed dived a quick death!,"I bought this unit earlier this year thinking I was getting a good deal for under a hundred dollars. Magnavox has always been a good brand and so I thought I would give it a try. So I bought one and was very pleased with the quality of the recordings, and the option to change the thumbnail on the menu, a feature that is very important to me. Five months later the unit died on me. I lose every program I record and since I didn't purchase the extended service plan I have to junk it. A hundred dollars wasted!I will never again buy any electronics made by Magnavox. I always believed that when you buy cheap you get cheap. This was no exception. I'll stick to higher priced models from Panasonic and others. At least the life expectancy on their DVD recorders is at least a couple of years.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,Good book for Pink Floyd Collections,I really enjoyed reading about the behind the scenes details of the start and career of Pink Floyd. The plethora of photographs add a nice personal touch to the book.
1,Thought granddaughter would love it,This is just not something that someone six or younger would enjoy so no I would not recommend it. Maybe for a kid who is in gymnastics but it just bombed!
4,Where's the sequel?,"City Baby is a perfect guide for pregnant women, and I assume for new mothers in NYC as well. My only criticism is that it's been too long since it was published and much of the information is outdated. There are many more resources available and, in the same token, several referenced sources are out of business. Where's the sequel? There's an enormous potential audience; I'd be first in line!"
5,Impactful and resourceful,"The ability to heal is a spiritual gift seldom acknowledged in mainstream churches yet is an undeniable gift from God (See John 14:12 among others). This book is a must read for anyone interested in starting or being involved in a healing ministry or just curious. Either way, you'll be more informed by this straightforward and easy to read book."
5,Beautiful!,I ordered this for a gift but had to keep it for myself. It is such a warm addition at Christmas.
2,NOT TITANIUM,"WARNING: HydraAlloy is NOT TITANIUM!!!! The description (as of 12 August 2011) is apparently for the other version of this knife, which comes in this version (Stainless Steel) and Titanium. Don't think you're getting a great deal on a titanium knife, as the description seems to suggest.That said, I'm sure it's just fine, as SS knives go. It's just that I DIDN'T WANT A STAINLESS STEEL KNIFE."
4,Good for the money,"This is a solid knife and is VERY easy to clean and disassemble. I got the knife in Okinawa and used it on many dives and, its not the easiest knife to get out of the sheeth but it isnt a deal breaker as the other reviewer said. Its totally worth the 30$ price tag Buy it!"
3,Already obsolete -- not for WindowsNT,"I'm not going to pan this book. It's actually pretty good. Unfortunately it's written for Personal Oracle 8.0.3 for Windows 95. I'm running Personal Oracle 8i 8.1.5 for Windows NT and you'd think it was a completely different product. The author spends alot of time discussing a component that doesn't even exist in version 8.1.5: the Oracle8 Navigator. Still, once you overcome installation issues the book has some useful information."
1,"Not silky, rough!","This shirt does not feel silky. I was expecting a cool, smooth feeling shirt against my skin. This is not what I received. This will be my first return ever. Do not buy unless you like scratchy shirts! Also, I have a pot belly and the XXL won't fit."
4,WOOHOO THE 85 BEARS -BEST EVER!,VERY NICE ITEM.. THE ONLY ITEM I NOTED WAS SOME OF THE GAMES THE FORMAT TO DVD IS NOT GREAT... NOT SURE WHY...
3,"Disappointing, though mildly entertaining","Godfather it ain't. It kept me turning its pages, but in the end left me feeling like Puzo probably got lazy, and with the publisher on his back, sent in a mediocre effort. It reads more like the outline of of an intriguing mafia saga, than a novel in its own right. The ending leaves much to be desired. Simply put, it's just pulp fiction. It might make a good movie, but the screenplay definitely has some holes to fill."
2,The Godfather It Is Not,"It is hard for me to imagine that Mario Puzo wrote this book. It is 316 double spaced pages of cliches and poorly developed characters. The main plot and various subplots defy belief and, if Puzo's name was not on the book, I would have thought that the book were the work of a first time author. There is none of the subtle color or detailed character development that have characterized Puzo's prior books or screenplays. Major figures in the book are introduced with just a line or two and Puzo rarely goes back to fill in the blanks. This book left me very unsatisfied and wishing the Puzo had not written it."
1,Puzo?,"I'm totally shocked that this book carries Mario Puzo's name. $25 for this? What a huge disappointment. Since Mr. Puzo was so severly ill before his death, I tend to think someone elso wrote this from his outline and draft. This story is so weak, that I just can't believe Puzo wrote it."
4,Very good but a bit short ...,"As an avid fan of all the Godfather movies/book, The Last Don etc I was thrilled to see the newest Mario Puzo book. The book is exciting and attention grabbing but I could not help but wonder why is seemed so short? There seems to be less violence and more action in this title. Some characters were nicely developed and others seemed under developed. I found it easy to get through and interesting to read. I was also left wanting more ..."
4,The Mafia: Part 3,"Part one was the Corleone's, then came the Clericuzio's then we end it on the Aprile's. This is a fine tale of greed, vengence and loyalty. The characters come out at you and thye come to life. The book is filled with good action, plot and dialog. However the problem is we have seen it all before. All in all it is a fine novel, good for a few evenings, and if you have never read Puzo before, it will be all new to you.Thanx for your time, T"
1,Disappointing,"After having just finished The Godfather, I looked forward to reading Puzo's last novel. What a disappointment!None of the (way too many) characters are very likeable. The plot, if you can call it that, is both unbelievableand hard to follow. I finally had to give it up about a third of the way through."
3,Simple and easy reading,"Omerta is the code of silence. Although Mario Puzo had created a vast number of contrasting characters in the story, none of them were fully explored and developed except for the lead Astora. The story did not really develop around Omerta and I found the title had been chosen more as a temptation to the readers.I had bought the book and read it twice but my recommendation was to borrow it. This story had a moderate pace and I would recommend it to any commuter who is looking for light reading materials."
3,Nothing new under the sun.,"This book again explores the mafia imaginated by Mr. Puzo. Mr Puzo describes the ""capos"" as inteligent and smart people who has strange bussines but people loves them and are delighted to live in such world. Those things only happen in Mr Puzo's head, actually capos are rude, cruel men who doesn't have any of the cualities explained by the Author.As he wrote in Godfather III, the story has again exagerations about the power of mafia (In god. III ""we have to save the pope"") and here making suggestions about corruption in Italy. IMHO he should be more careful telling such things.Finally the name of one of the bad guys : Marriano Rubio. Marriano isn't an Spanish name. Maybe he wanted to write Mariano Rubio a former Bank of Spain president accused of corruption in mid 90's."
2,Awful Letdown.,"Maybe the realism of the Sopranos coupled with the actual decline of the mafia makes this book seem so very unimportant. The writing itself is pitched at the average fourth grader and Puzo is the master of using the trite expression.The world view put forth is that everyone but everyone is crooked on this planet so by the time you put the book down you are exhausted with the duplicity. Frankly, if you MUST read this book either go to the library or wait for the paperback."
1,Broke After 3 Tires,"Do not buy. I was afraid of purchasing after reading mixed reviews and will be sending back to Amazon for return. Can tell cheap manufacture, do not recommend and no gauge!"
4,So far so good plus how to use this pump,"I've used this pump a few times over several months for our 2 cars. Like some other reviewers I would try to pump like I normally would with a smaller pump or foot pump. This would usually result in not much air going into the tire or the cylinder popping out of the base with a loud pop. Like others have mentioned, stand straight over the pump, pump slower with both hands, and it will work just fine."
5,The greatest CD of 2006,"Oh My God ! Awesome ! I'm a french fan of Emilie Simon, and all what she done, do, or will do. She's the most complete artist I ever know ! She sing, write, compose, performe all sound and produce her albums... The sound & Univer of Emilie Simon is unique ! She records some strange song, and put it beautifully into music... This is a real journey... Awesome lyrics too... I you like, Bjork or Goldfrapp or Imogen heap, GO GO GO !!!! Or if you like french touch... GO TOO :D You'll love it as me... (L)"
4,Not what the title suggests!,"I have to admit I purchased this book because of the hot title and it was a little bit of a let down because of it. That being said, I still thought the suggestions and the advice given in this book was good. It was my own fault what little disappointment I felt after reading this book. I was expecting something a little more??? Well you know, right?"
3,"Por: moré Tales,of Mystery & Imagination","Good Work, I am happy I decid to buy it.It is an interest continuation of Tales of Mystery and Imagination, clearly not as impacting and strong proposal.But nice to hear and have it."
1,Not a good choice!,This book is not very helpful. Instructions and examples are vague and focus too much on the sample DB on the CD.
5,Helped me to get going!!!,"This book is not meant to be the ultimate reference for access it did exactly for me what i expected. It got me started into the world of Access programming. It was long and did over explain a lot, but that was what i needed at the time. SO for me, it was perfect.As a bonus, when i was in a rut and i needed an answer i found the authors Email address in the book and he helped to steer me in the right direction a couple of times. Now I have moved on to more technical books about the Access world, but i am very thankful for the groundwork this book helped me to lay down."
4,greyfriars bobby,"a gift for my great grandson whose Daddy's ancestry is scottish & will hopefully enjoy reading to his son. have to admit I was a little disappointed there were not illustrations to captivate a 3 year olds attention,but a lovely book all the same."
1,Do not like feel of denim,Purchased this for my son. Too stiff of a denim even after washing. May return...not happy with this pair of jeans.
1,I doubt I could give this away without anyone hating me.,"One day I asked a customer at work what cologne he was wearing and he said it was called red (something). So I checked it out on the reviews on youtube and amazon, mostly everyone said it smelt great. I said to myself ""this has got to be it"" This stuff smells horrible. This is not what the guy was wearing. I boxed it up and tossed it under my bathroom sink. I would never be caught wearing this. Good thing I have a little of YSL ""La nuit De L'homme"" left."
4,infant gate,"Overall, I am happy with the product. I find that it is a little hard to open at times, but I feel it is very secure and sturdy."
1,"Hardware breaks, Horrible Summer Infant Customer Service","We have four of these gates in our house because we needed extra wide gates and wanted gates with hardware mounted into the wall. Now the hardware is starting to break and Summer Infant does not offer replacements. They want you to buy a new gate instead of offering replacements. When the hardware does break, good luck getting in touch with customer service, they don't respond to customers. Now, I have a broken gate, holes in the wall where the hardware goes and they want me to buy another gate. I won't be buying anything more from Summer Infant!"
2,Painted over rust,"I purchased 3 of these and the first one opened had peeling paint where it had been painted over rust. I was able to return all 3 without difficulty to Amazon.comIt should also be noted that these are permanent installations, meaning you can't remove the gates from the hinges temporarily. For this reason, I would recommend the KidCo Safeway G20."
5,RED ROYAL GUARD IS SO COOL!!!!!,This royal guard is so cool. It is very hard to fing though like the blue royal guard. I have both now which is really cool because these are very hard to find figures Get it if you can. I have no problems with this figure. IT'S GREAT!!!!!!!!!
4,"Great content, a little disappointed in the format","I bought this book because we checked it out of our local library and just loved it. It really does bang on all cylinders -- the artwork, the poetry, and subject matter and lesson...Unfortunately, the book we got from Amazon was not quite the same as the one we experienced at the library. It was smaller, reduced by maybe 25%, and just didn't seem to be as nicely published. Thinner paper and covers, and so on. I'm glad to have it in my collection, but still a little wistful at what I remembered of it originally."
2,Not so good....,"What I like about Terax Latte is it has a nice aroma, however, I've been using it for a couple of weeks and my scalp doesn't get as cleaned as with the other brand I was using before, and my hair gets so dry. So I will go back to Mitchell clarifying shampoo."
5,Wonderfully Surprising Book,"I bought this book to give to a friend who loves the Southwest and its history. I opened it one night just to get a taste of the story because Preston is one of my favorite fiction writers.I was hooked and I haven't put the book down since. It is a story full of adventure and mystery and it is teeming with history. But there is humor and honesty too as the men travel in unfamiliar territory on horses they are not used to riding.This gets my highest rating. If you like adventure, if you love the southwest, if you love the early history of the west, this is a book you will love!"
2,A lot of interesting stuff not here,"C;mon Sire! There's way more interesting stuff than this! Where is ""Ave Maria"" by West India Company or ""Stop!"" by Data or ""Close Your Eyes"" by Deborah Harry or ""Uncertain Smile"" by The The or ""Big Hollow Man"" by Danielle Dax."
5,Suffocation is awesome,"one listen to their s/t album will tell you: they are here to stay. I have their 2K4 album ""Souls To Deny"" and I didn't have to even listen to the new album to tell everyone that it stomps. the bonus CD included with this album also stomps. I believe Suffocation is sending a message to Morbid Angel (please come back!), but I heard that Morbid Angel is coming out with a new album this year."
2,"Ticks the boxes, but phew!!","This is a reduction of Donald Kagan's own more scholarly work on the subject for the ordinary reader. If I could have the last 3 weeks of my life back, I'd wait for the Reader's Digest version.Too much detail, a kaleidoscope of characters and locations coming and going, and no real overview. The maps are poor and the descriptions of battles are limited.To the author, who has been immersed in the subject, it may seem like a summary. To someone who picks it up for a read over Christmas, it's a 500 page list of events which take place over decades."
4,Read the Greeks,"Given the sources for this material I see no reason to let Kagan filter the original material to the reader. In my opinion, he makes the traditional error of supposing the ancient Greeks were just older versions of ourselves. Herodotus may have pulled our legs sometimes but he did show that they were in reality very different from ourselves. I see this problem everywhere in Greek scholarship. Especially in the works targeted to the general public. It is hard to beat reading Thucydides and Xenophon and the others for ourselves."
5,Excellent!,"Just finished reading this book. Wow! Excellent---across the board. Covers just about every aspect of this monumental struggle between Athens and Sparta and gives it historical context that is applicable to today.Moreover, Kagan's writing is lucid and engaging. I couldn't put this book down, and I am not a history buff!"
3,Newer Version Available.,Just Bought NOF 7 for $99 new. Did not know that NOF 7.5 is the latest version not being sold on Amazon. Looks like another $68 to upgrade to NOF 7.5.
3,"OK, but others do it better","Diana Krall's best Christmas song is ""Young, Lonesome Soldier"", and it's not on this CD. As I listened to ""Christmas Songs"", I kept thinking, ""this is ok, but X does it better"". ""Jingle Bells"". Streisand's is better. ""Let it Snow"". Manhattan Transfer is better. ""Winter Wonderland"". Amy Grant does it better. ""I'll be Home for Christmas"". Karen Carpenter's version is better. ""What are you doing New Year's"". Steve Tyrell has a better version. OK, she's the best on ""Chrismas Time is here"" and matches the best on a couple of others. But overall, it's not as good as I'd hoped. Maybe there are so few standard Christmas songs that it's hard to do something really new."
2,Show Me Your Legs For Christmas,"Ms. Krall apparently aimed for ""Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas"" but her uninspired performances miss the mark. I'm left with the impression that she was bored with the whole idea of a holiday album, but was dragged into producing one to raise a few bucks. Cool detachment may be stylish, but when it comes to this subject matter, please, leave it at home. On a positive note, the backing arrangements and musicians are excellent - hence the two stars. Can we get a version with the vocals stripped away?Oh yes, and the cover - rarely have I seen one that gives a more accurate idea of what you'll get inside - no clue about the subject matter. Do yourself a favor, if you want the best jazz-vocal holiday collection, skip this disc and get Ella Fitzgerald's early '60's classic instead."
5,The Best Chistmas CD,Is the best christmas songs cd I bought. Diana Krall has a lovely voice. It worth every penny.
1,Diana talks her way through this snoozefest,"I'm a big Krall fan AND a sucker for X-mas albums, so for me to not like this one is saying something. First the rhythms and arrangements are all just so wrong: forced, inappropriate, not good. Second, no holiday spirit, this feels like an album recorded in the dog days of August. Lastly, this sounds more like Diana doing her impression of Rex Harrison. Hon- try sustaining a note or two here or there, listening to you speak your way through old chestnuts is as dull as dirt. When I pay, I want a singer to SING, call me crazy! Don't waste your time with this one or you'll have a blue christmas, that's certain!"
1,If you can stomach the awful writing ....,"and have limited experience in call center management, then this book may be of some value. If you are a reasonably experienced supervisor or manager in a decent organization, this book will be of little to no value. If you are new to management in a call center, and don't feel you've been part of quality organizations in the past, you may glean a few best practices from this book.The writing though is truly wretched. Words are embarrassingly misused throughout the book, and the overall writing quality is poor enough to be a constant distraction. This book is only for the truly desperate. There are so few books specifically on call center management, I decided to order this for myself without reviewed a copy. It was a mistake.Note that the book is self-published by the author. No reputable publisher would have published this."
5,One of the best R&B albums ever...,"This CD is somewhere between the #1 and #2 spot on my all-time favorites list. I have practically worn my disc out! I know this album back and forth; for a good reason! It has to be one of the best R&B debuts ever. If you have an appreciation for soul-inspired, sensuous and beautiful lyrics, hypnotizing vocals and a good groove... This is your answer. I can't say enough good things about this album. Nothing is perfect, but this is darn close. This will ALWAYS be a classic. Go buy this one, it's a keeper."
2,Frustrating,"I got this for my husband - it looked great and I know he was not happy with the shaver he had - the blades seemed to dull so fast - He does NOT like it. I was going to get replacement cartridges but he told me not to bother - the problem he was having was not with the shaving performance - that seemed ok - his problem was the charger/cleaner - most of the time the shaver would not sit in the cradle right - in order for it to complete the cleaning cycle he had to hold it in place the entire time - almost seems like the shaver does not have enough weight to keep it situated right in the cradle - needless to say, he does not want to deal with that every day - he has coarse red hair and reviews the shaving capabilities so-so - will try to get with Braun to see if they can do anything"
5,Pulsonic sings,"I have used electric shavers for over 50 years, and the Pulsonic 9595 is by far the finest shaver I have ever experienced. It shaves close, is quiet, and fast. It's not cheap, but based on my limited experience with it so far it is worth the money."
1,Braun Sucks.....not for First time Electric Shavers,"For first time users...stay away... I am stuck & looking to sell my item on ebay.I will never use Electric in my life, returned back to my Gillette Fusion blade & Razor. I can now see my face back how it was before I was using an Electric shaverI know cheap shavers perform worse, but how come an Expensive High end 790CC give out a Single-Star performance. when ever I use this, I still have to use my Gillette Fusion with Foam on my neck area. & also with out using any oil like""""LECTRIC SHAVE"""" you will rip-off your skin.I tried using this for 4 months, just not to complain a Great Brand.but finally I gave-up. Braun sucks"
4,Good System,It's a system therefore it is bulky. You have to shave opposite direction to get a smoothe shave. Blades are easy to glide. cleaning can be done maually ot auto. This is only for dry shaving.
1,Braun not for me,"Tried this after many years with Norelco. It pulled and grabbed my chin hairs and it was painful. I called Braun, very nice folks. They sent me a new head. Same problem. I finally chucked it. I tried and tried but couldn't get past the hair grabbing. Back to Norelco and everything is much better...."
5,great razor,"Best razor I have owned. This one replace a 5 year old Braun with the battery giving out. Rather than replace the battery, I purchased the new razor. It was a great decision."
4,Great shaver,"Nice design, fits my hand and face well. The cleaning feature seems to do its job, not sure about the cost effectiveness. Razor does require multiple passes to cut all hair."
5,"9595 Braun,Great shaver","Just got my new 9595 Braun in the mail, and even though I have only used it twice I'm so far impressed. Thisshaver replaced my old Norelco James Bond series which the battery started to go after two years. The Braun9595 cuts better than my old norelco, and does not pull and rip the hairs like the norelco. Another great thingabout the Braun is that after several minutes of shaving it does not get hot on the skin, and the cleaning systemis great, the shaver feels new after it goes through it's cleaning cycle. The price is a little steep, but it seems tobe a good foil shaver so far, only time will tell, but I would at least refer this type of shaver to a friend."
4,Smooth shaving ...,"It's been a month and so far I am quite satisfied with this shaver. From the indicators a fully charged shaver can last me longer than a week and that is good when you travel short periods and dont want to carry the chord. noise level is lower than the one Braun I just replaced. That one is about 8 years old and still in good working condition. As a customer I just don't appreciate the expensive replacement cost of the head, the cutters or the liquid cleaning solution. They should be a lot cheaper since they already charged the shaver as much as they do. Also I shouldn't have to clean it so often with the liquid cleaner as the indicators demand. Once a week for that kind of cleaning should suffice!!!"
5,Closest shave with an electric razor,"Love it! The closest shave with an electric razor. Very convenient, in less than five minutes I can get a nice, close shave and not have to worry about cuts. The Clean & Renew system is also very convenient."
5,Great Shaver,Best electric Shaver I have ever used! Use to use 4 blade razor and but this electric shaver shaves just as close. Great Product
5,Best Shaver Ever (and I have tried them all),"I am one of the hardest people to please and am usually sceptical of other's reviews on products.That being said this shaver is by far the most superior shaver ever. I have tried a lot of other high-end shavers and can honestly say this is the closest shave I have ever got from an electric. Heck, it is pretty close to using a blade! You might be able to get closer with a blade, but it would be so minimally closer than with the Braun that you can't tell.The cleaning system is awesome too! No more cleaning the razor. Just hit the button and the system takes care of itself. No emptying cut hair from the razor... I love this Braun. It's expensive, but worth every single penny!"
2,Great when it works,"I purchased this for my husband through Amazon in early June. By early August the shaver stopped charging. I am BUYING a new cord to see if this is the problem. If it isn't resolved, I'll be calling Braun for a replacement because this is an expensive shaver. Seriously, I don't want to deal with these issues when I pay a lot for an item."
4,Great shaver but poorly designed trimmer,"I would have given this shaver 4.5 stars just on good shave-ability alone but couldn't find a way to do that. A minor annoyance is the trimmer which is only useful for trimming sideburns. If you want to touch up a goatee or moustache it's pretty much useless. The older model shaver that I'm retiring for this one had a much better design. Overall I recommend this shaver, but have to admit that it is pricey."
3,Fine but somewhat disappointing,"I got this to replace my 5 year old 7680 whose battery was starting to run dry. This new one's okay, but the old model cost $50 less, cuts closer, has a better trimmer and has a more solid ""built-in-Germany"" feel to it. The new one does not look or feel like a $200 shaver. I'd recommend saving $50 and getting the superior 7680..."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON - YOU CAN'T RETURN IT,"YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS SHAVER TO AMAZON FOR ANY REASON! Braun Series 7 Shaver. I like Amazon and am a frequent buyer from this website and I will continue to buy from Amazon -- but not products you can't return. This shaver was given to me for a Christmas gift. I wanted to return it and the Amazon rep pointed out that because it has a FLAMMABLE cleaning cartridge they will not accept a return and she said it is stated clearly on the website. Well, it IS stated on the web page, but I would not say 'clearly.' It is in small print below the copy describing the shaver. BUYER BEWARE."
1,Disappointed,I bought this shaver back in August when it came out. I was really interested in seeing how well it performed based on how happy everyone was with the product. I have owned quite a few Braun shavers and to be honest I really don't care for this one. I have very soft skin so my beard comes in light at some parts under my neck. I just finished shaving and the shaver was actually running hot. I really wanted to like this product a lot but I guess it might work better on certain type of beards
3,Husband loves the shaver,"My husband loves this shaver. He's had it for 2.5 year when the base suddenly would't charge the shaver anymore. I removed the cleaning solution and tried cleaning the base thinking that maybe dirt or something had gotten stuck inside. No such luck. The base unit lights up but won't charge. Finally unplugged it from the base and plugged it directly into the shaver so he could use it.The base is expensive to replace. Like at least $70. Search ebay and other sites for a replacement base and found a place in Virginia Beach, VA called Commonwealth Electric Shavers. Purchased it online for $57 including tax and shipping. For a shaver that almost $300 it should definitely last longer."
3,No Better Than Less Expensive Models,"To be brief: money was not a factor so I decided to buy the best shaver available and chose the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic model. I already owned a Braun Series 3 (340)that I kept in my apartment. I cannot tell any difference between the two in most regards. If you gave me a blind test and asked me to choose between the two, the only thing that is noticeable is that the Pulsonic is heavier. Otherwise, they are both good shavers but the Series 7 is certainly not worth the far greater expense and I would not repeat the purchase if given the chance to do so."
4,Works great,"It certainly doesn't give you as close of a shave as the old fashion shaving cream and shaver, but it does a good job. If you shave often (don't let it get too long) it doesn't scratch or pull at all, also if you go over one area a couple times you can get a close enough shave. The cleaner cleans it really well, just not sure how much it will add up to be.I also haven't used it for a long while so I am carious to see how long the blades work as those are pretty pricy.If you want to get an electric shaver I would recommend it, also I would recommend trying an electric shaver cause so far I do like it over shaving cream and all that jazz.Also as one last note it goes over the groves just as well a standard shaver, but thing long hairs more near the neck it doesn't do as well. I have pretty bony jaw and it works well. Also the price and shipping time was really good."
5,Comments on Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver,I've used an electric shaver for about 60 years. I am very pleased with this one; it is by far the best one I've ever owned.
5,My third Braun and the best ever,"I have owned three Braun electric razors in the ""cleaning"" series; a 7 series, and 8 series and now the 9 series. The 7 series I have given to a family member and it is five years old and still as solid as ever. The 8 series I accidentally left in a hotel room in Europe so I had to buy a new one. Given how much I loved my 8 series I thought I would try the 9 Pulsonic series. I waited two months to review it to see if it lived up to the hype and I can say now it does. I have a heavy beard but with alot of small flat hairs on the lower part of my neck. This razor handles both exceptionally well and it takes fewer passes than even my 8 series did. You have to use it for 2-3 weeks for your whiskers to adapt, so be patient with it. I highly recommend this razor."
4,Braun Series 7 -790 cc,"I bought this razor for my husband and these are his thoughts. ""I have been using this razor for about 1 month now and I would rate this product as very good. It has taken about a month for my face to adjust between the new Braun razor and the Norelco I used previously."" He says this razor does give a closer shave than the previous rotery razor, and most notiably has a decreased ""5 o'clock shadow"". It also has a better trimer."
4,Good shaver,"I've had this shaver for about a month and it's working great. It's quiet and gives a close, very comfortable shave. My only quibble is that, like previous Braun shavers I've owned, it doesn't always grab the neck hair and I occasionaly have to pull out the straight edge. The cleaning system has been great so far, and I've usually been able to clean it every other day on the ""economy"" setting instead of the recommended daily cleaning, effectively doubling the life of the cleaning solution."
1,Worst shaver I've ever used.,"I really wanted to like this shaver, especially given the price. Unfortunately, it is the worst shaver I have ever used. It simply does not shave close at all. I should have stuck with my Braun 7680 and just replaced the cutter and foil block."
4,Braun Series 7 review,Quiet - nice design. Like very well overall. I still have to go over some places more than once but compared to previous razors - it seems to work about the best.
1,Too much for too little,"Braun Series 7- 790cc (9595) Pulsonic ShaverThis was too much money for the quality of shave I'm getting. I switched from a Norelco that I had since 2003 and am pretty disappointed. To be fair I've given the razor about two weeks to get used to my face, yet I still am not getting a close shave. If I shave at 5AM, I look like I need to shave again at 10AM and my beard isn't that thick. The best advice I can give is save the money and buy a 40-50 dollar shaver. I would return it, but it would be like returning a pair of underwear after wearing them."
2,just aight,while I dig Luther Vandross&Some of Mariah Carey's work this cut adds nothing to the Original that Lionel Richie&Diana Ross did back in 1981. the voices of Vandross&Carey are Good together but there is nothing that makes me compare it to the original.it's aight at best to me.
5,Fascinating Glance at a Vanished People,"Jerald Milanich had no easy task in assembling a readable survey of the Timucua people. A tribe of Native Americans based in north Florida and south Georgia, the Timucua were at ground zero of European colonialism and, by 1767, were no more. It was a demographic nightmare. Milanich relies on French and Spanish sources as well as archeology to create as thorough a portrait we will ever get of the Timucua. He offers an interesting look on their religion, political system, trade and livelihoods but most of the book focuses on the years of Spanish rule. The book is very readable and, while Milanich is clearly sympathetic to the plight of the Timucuans, he is able to praise Europeans when he feels it is merited--for example, Francisco Pareja, a Franciscan who was able to compile a dictionary of the Timucuan language. The book is very readable and offers as good a picture as we will ever get of this long vanished people."
1,needs a set up wizard,"looks like a quality part, but i have yet to get it configured to open my draw. it pulses, and beeps, so the trigger is working, but needs a better explaination of powering the draw. It also should have told you it needs a full pinout rj11 with all 6 points to work on some draws.Most phone lines only have 4 pin connections. If your draw uses pin 2 and 6 it won't work with a regular phone line connection.I'm sure it will work once the power gets through the converter to complete the circut, I'm guessing to reassign the connections and the port on the computer."
3,Barbie Model for Hand-made Items,"This is a nice doll. I am starting to make Barbie size clothes, possibly to sell at craft fairs. I needed several models, and didn't want all caucasian Barbies. I also have an African American Barbie, and might purchase an Asian Barbie in the future."
2,Maybe as a historical reference?,"This book is completely out dated in terms of the production quality and the information it presents. I read the author's own review: ""It is what it is,"" true enough, it's a 1970s style manual. It does outline some basic tactics, dos and don'ts etc about moving under fire in an urban environment. It has these tactics on an individual and team level. So, there is quality stuff in here, timeless basics even. However the presentation is so archaic that you will be left wondering what you paid for. I would recommend a more modern manual. There are probably better purpose built SWAT manuals out there or most of this information can be found in military FMs with better production quality. A lot of the individual and small team stuff is in Gabe Suarez's tactical advantage.""It is what it is"" indeed. In the early 80s it was a beginners SWAT manual. Today it is Paladin Press trying to turn a cheap coin."
4,Great Acoustic Set,"This is a GREAT CD. Of course, anything Toad is automatic greatness, and when you add acoustic and live to the equation you have a sure-fire win on your hands. It's well worth buying, especially if you like the songs ""Something's Always Wrong"" (Great studio acoustic version) and ""Walk On The Ocean"" (Randy Guss calls it one of two possible quintessential Toad songs--and just listen to that chorus live!!) I just wish there weren't those dang breaks in mid-conversation....."
4,"good fit, durable","I bought a discontinued (?) color on sale. This is a great shoe and very durable, good support,instant fit. This is my third pair. Tread lasts two plus years with regular use. I hope they keep making this shoe at the current quality, if so, they will have a loyal customer. I hope the color schemes aren't garish when I need my next pair! That's the only reason for the 4 rating, current colors schemes are ugly."
5,Grandkids love it,Wanted the alternative view for the grandkids...not just the PC taught at school. Even parents and grandparents have enjoyed it
4,ONE OF SANDLERS BEST FILMS! EXCELLENT CAST! 4 1/2 STARS!,"I went to see this film in a theater when it was released and thought it was OK, but after watching it on DVD a few times over the years it has really grown on me. Henry Winkler, Jimmy Reed and Kathy Bates are hystrical in this lovable and funny movie. A classic sports comedy that blows away his lame remake of the Longest Yard!"
2,And to think.. the Wedding Singer was GOOD!!!!!!!,"I should have known better than to even think I would like this movie. I like Adam Sandler, but....I hate football, and the two just don't mix at all. I guess Drew Barrymore must bring out the best in 'ol Adam. Happy Gilmore and the Wedding Singer were MUCH better!!!!!"
1,This movie is bad. Very bad.,"I could go on and on about this movie, but I would only be rehashing already stated views. Adam Sandler is funny, this movie is not. This movie is horrible and I can think of no bigger waste of money."
5,The Waterboy,This movie is one of Adam Sandler's best and with Kathy Bates as his mom. You've got to see this one.
3,"Average Film, Great Sandler Acting!","To start, the film was pretty stupid. It really doesn't have any substance, and the story is slow and stupid.That said, it is a pretty good film. ""WHAT?"" You say. I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and I think his acting, and insane humor saved this film, and made it watchable."
1,One of The Worst Movies Ever Made,"I like Adam Sandler,but there was nothing funny about this movie at all.It is just plain stupid. Not even worth one star or a review.Pure garbage."
3,"it was good but not the best ( may 2 , 1999 )","it is a good movie to see when you need something to lift you up . if you are not in a bad mood than it isn't the best movie to see . if you liked it well than great but when people are making jokes about body parts and thigs like that , well that just isn't my idea of a good movie ."
2,Worse Than Ever,"Sarah Paretsky started out as an amateur with a good premise: a real believable hard-boiled woman character. Her first books were entertaining, despite her obvious limitations as a writer. She no longer is an amateur and I no longer have patience with her incredibly awkward writing, her relentless inclusion of information that a talented high school-aged writer would know to edit out, lame dialogue and cardboard-cutout characters. After a dozen novels in what appears to be a very successful career, it is incumbent upon her to either try to learn more about her craft, or at least get an editor who can clean up her books for her. The mystery field has a lot of very talented women writers - Lindsey Davis, Donna Leon, Ellis Peters, Margaret Lawrence, Jamie Harrison, Martha Grimes, and on and on. Readers should demand better from their favorite authors than someone like Paretsky gets away with."
3,a good read,"This is an enjoyable read. It is another V.I. Warshawski novel so we all know something about it. Though I like most of these novels this ones is slow, and at times tedious, but it is a good read. Always want to know what Warshawski is up to.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Sooo Comfy : ),"I got these shoes in 2 days ago ... I had to place a pair of Heel insoles in them for a little more cushion, but over all they are great!!! Paired with the insoles, they are like walking on a cloud - the shoes are true to size."
3,Just OK,This tape worked ok. You do need to shine light really close to it and directly on it for it to glow. It's not reflective tape. Does not really work with black lights either.
2,Disappointing,"I chose this tape over paint because I thought it would be easier. I wish I hadn't. First of all, I found it difficult to remove the tape from its backing. Secondly, the adhesive was very poor. (I was attempting to use it on painted cardboard.) Lastly, I found that the glow was only bright in pitch darkness. I would not buy this product again."
4,JVCC GLW Glow in the Dark Tape,With this glow tape placed on the edges of the steps on a darkened stairway eliminates a previous hazard. It can be seen very well during the day also.
4,"Amazing aroma, but flavor is very subtle","I purchased Stash Holiday Chai after it was recommended in a discussion thread about favorite teas. It certainly sounded delicious--I like chai, and the blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger Root, allspice, clove, gingerbread, and nutmeg spices sounded absolutely scrumptious, especially for the holidays! And granted, while steeping, this tea does smell absolutely wonderful; it truly brings to mind all of the goodness and richness of the holidays. When I tasted the tea, however, I was a bit disappointed: I was expecting something pretty exotic, especially with the splash of rum flavor, but instead, all I could detect was a very subtly seasoned black tea (I couldn't even taste the chai). I have experimented with this tea and tried steeping it for longer periods, but that has not seemed to make a difference. I gave the product 4 stars because it is not a bad-tasting tea; it just was not nearly as flavorful as I had anticipated and hoped for."
3,Personal Dust Collector,"Honestly, I've skimmed through this book. It's probably most interesting to X-Men fans with a background in science, but for the common X-reader...it's a non-essential.I read through the sections on my favorite characters, but it couldn't hold my interest enough to keep reading about my non-favorite characters. And right now it is on my bookshelf, collecting dust and waiting to be donated to a used bookstore."
4,After three years...,"...I saw CFSC in [a local store]. I promptly bought it.For 1996-98, CFS1 and FS 98 are pretty good...... FS 98 has pretty bad graphics, and a small selection of planes. CFS1 looks horrible on default graphics, but after a little tinkering looks just fine. The battle damage is only fair, and through some glitch, your bullets at times go right through enemy aircraft. You cant fight Me-262s, only get them on the ground. One huge good point-the importable aircraft and scenery. Ever try to dogfight a Focke-Wulf in a 737?If you buy this game because you're looking for cool grahics and hot action, you will be terribly disappointed..."
5,"An amazing movie, and a brilliant concept.","The Last Passport is one of those movies, although not perfect, which will be one that I remember. The story of how it was written, cast, produced and edited in such a short period of time with such a tiny budget is fascinating. The movie itself is as much a mystery as anything else as you watch it, but when you know the full story it becomes a parable, and that was a magnificent transformation. And even after the end you still have some questions to wonder about.As has been noted by others, the casting is excellent. Bravo."
3,"Good story, too repetitious","This book had much to say. Unfortunately it keeps saying the same things over and over again as though the reader may have forgotten. I don't know how many times he felt we needed to be told how Grant felt about just about everything: perhaps nine times we were told how he felt about his friend Will, about Annie, about Susan, about his father. Nothing new was added in the retelling. Not very deep. It is as though he kept a Diary and recounted everything he thought and did for a period of time.Also, he seemed to think that sarcasm and blunt reference was necessary for friendship. He uses it in friendship but not with daughters and women. His opinion seems to be that women must take on the characteristics of men in order to appeal to this masculine blunt main character. A weakness in the thinking of many."
3,I Changed My MIND... ONLY 1*!!!!,"These Espresso Glasses are Classy and very elegant. However they are delicate, so if you are looking for dishwasher safe or something a little more sturdy then I wouldn't recommend these. Upon receiving the mug style glasses I filled the sink with some warm water and soap and left them to soak before their first use. Three of the glasses were absolutely fine but the third was faulty and the ""Empty Space"" inside the glass filled up with water which I cannot remove. So I now have a glass that is full of old soapy water. A few weeks later, whilst washing two of the glasses lightly knocked together and they instantly broke. I now have one left and I don't assume it will last very long! I think I'll be turning to the old faithful Bodum, granted, they're more expensive, but as they say, cheap costs more in the long run!"
2,"Good Idea, Poor Implementation",This book is fairly easy to read and covers the subject in a logical order. However the examples and problems are rife with errors and inconsistent nomenclature--making this a hard book to use as a text.
3,"okay, but not great",did not find this dvd stimulating or refreshing...thought gardiner was a bit bored with his guests....he has other dvds that are strange and weird.
3,Not one of Updike's best,"Praised as one of Updike's best books, The Centaur is in reality little more than a confusing and disappointing literary ego trip. Its premise is original and promising, but the novel simply does not live up to its potential. Updike is trying here to accomplish too much, and as a result he accomplishes very little. The narrative is disjointed, the characters' voices are remarkably inconsistent, and the plot drags. And the book's most fatal flaw is that it fails to communicate precisely what its message is. The reader is left with the big unanswered question of why this book is deserving of our attention. One senses that there is some deeper meaning, some profound truth trying to reveal itself. But one also wonders if maybe it's all just Updike putting a glossy wax on an otherwise unimpressive surface."
2,disappointed,"I was given a list of books to choose from for a project in my high school sophmore honors english class and this book was on it. I skimmed it before I decided and I saw references to mythology which I am very interested in. Unfortunatly it didnt turn out to be at all what I was hopping for. I had a terrible time getting into the book, it was confussing with all the changes in narratives and the time jumps. I also was confussed about the double character thing. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyoneone who isnt VERY knowledgeable about mythology."
3,works fine for small areas,"This item does what it represents itself to do. It works as advertised, but when you have an oak tree and a zillion nuts to pick up a rake and shovel are much faster."
5,great for small crop,This thing works great. Now of course if you have an grove I wouldn't bother however it does a great job picking up the pecans. I bought 2 of these so my Granddaughter and I could roll together it is simple enough that she has fun doing it too. We have 30 trees so I just roll this around every day and pick up what has dropped.
5,LIFE SAVER,"SINCE I GREW UP IN A HOME WHERE BOTH PARENTS WERE ALCOHOLICS, I KNOW ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF DESPARATION, LONELINESS, AND DENIAL. I KNOW ABOUT PHYSICAL, VERBAL AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE. NOW THAT I AM AN ADULT, I HAVE ISSUES WITH TRUST, COMMITMENT AND EXPERIENCING JOY. THIS BOOK AND OTHER AL-ANON LITERATURE HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER FOR ME. THE INSPIRATIONAL PASSAGES HELPS ME THINK ABOUT MY LIFE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE ALCOHOLISM IN THE FAMILY. IT HELPS ME SEE HOPE AND LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL ADULT CHILDREN, SPOUSES, AND/OR FRIENDS OF AN ALCOHOLIC. IT DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS."
4,Seems good so far,"The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star review is that I haven't read but a few pages. I am trying to literally read it day-by-day. But so far, so good. I try to read each day's affirmation at several points throughout the day. Hoping the wisom will sink in eventually!"
4,"R&B, Jazz, Dance all Rolled into One!!","Larry Heard a.k.a. Mr. Fingers has been a big player on the Chicago dance club scene for many years. So I was surprised to hear his song ""What About This Love?"" on a Smooth Jazz station while on a trip about 13 years ago. After purchasing the CD, I noticed that it has many interesting flavors to offer. ""Survivor"" is a nice and smooth listen. ""Closer"" is a hip to the groove track. The only thing that took away the star was the tracks that didn't appear on the original album. I though they were more fillers. Overall, it was a nice experience!!"
5,SMOOOOOOTH.....,"...damn, I wasn't patient enough with the album. I didn't give it a chance to grow on me and I sold my only copy. :/...I finally hunted me down a new one!!!...Classic R'n'B house sounds; BEAUTIFUL compositions & vocals."
1,Wast of Money,My 6 year old daughter got this for Christmas. It held her interest for less than 5 minutes. There's nothing to show where to put your feet. Simply a waste of money. Better to go buy some pom poms and let them jump around.
4,an eye opener on Protools in practice,"Excellent explanations of the fundamental concepts of Protools. Lots of practical hints and tips (e.g. on the usage of ""Aux in"" tracks). The focus is not on explaining every Protools feature (that's what the manuals are for), but to give you a clear view on how to use Protools in daily practice. The authors know how to teach (which is not the same as just knowing how to use a tool without being able to explain to others). I would have given 5 stars if there hadn't been several editing errors in (this first edition of) the book (e.g. screenshots not matching the associated description)."
2,painful,"You know, if I see one more stuffy, poorly directed/edited/produced art dvd....I'm going to scream. No wonder people who aren't artists want to slit their wrists when their new boyfriend/girlfriend suggests they ""get cultured"" and watch this DVD on artists' and their lives. The artists seem bored in the video (overall) and the questions are the same top 10 questions you always hear. Save the money and buy some nice whiskey."
5,Genuinely wholesome and entertaining,"Before hearing this CD, which my wife bought for my 4-year-old daughter, I expected to be embarrassed by preachiness about virtuous behavior. At the same time I naturally would like my child to be exposed to virtues in art. To my delight, and especially for the sake of my little girl, Red Grammer has managed to create a CD about being virtuous that's just plain fun and entertaining throughout the album. He has a fine voice, turns a clever phrase, and performs songs in just about every genre you can think of except perhaps Klezmer. My little girl plays this CD repeatedly, and as a result Grammer's catchy tunes, for better or worse, are constantly stuck in my head. But that's not bad -- I'm learning vitues too! This is wholesome, family-friendly kids' music at its best."
3,"It works, mostly.","The action jacket works fine overall. I really like the clip, it clips securely to your pocket/waist/shoulder strap. It is good that the clip works so well because the armband was a disappointment. It is awkward and too big to fit my arm comfortably. The band is almost as wide as the player is long and to fit my (average to small, female) arm it needs to be almost doubled so it ends up being bulky and fiddly. The jacket itself works OK but I was hopping for a better fit. For something made especially for this player I expected it to line up better with the buttons and be more fitted. I would get this product again because it does protect my player and allows me to clip it on to work out but only because there is no other case made for the Sansa c240 mp3 player."
1,Don't buy it.,"This was given as a Christmas gift and is already falling apart, not holding its position when in use. The recipient is rightfully upset."
1,Terrible ebook,Curious George is great. This ebook had tiny fonts and the photos did not display with the correct words. This was my first ebook purchase for my sons kindle. I am unimpressed with the quality of the conversion from paper to ebook.
4,If your a Deveraux fan a must read,I have read many of Jude Deveraux's books espically the taggert/montgormery ones and I have to say I enjoyed this one. As I do all of them. It is a definate must read if your Deveraux fan. At times Samantha the heronie was a bit unlikeable but it all comes together in the end and you end up really liking her.
1,I couldn't finish it,"This book just didn't make any sense. It was so full of cliches. What does a man do if he wants to make a woman happy? He takes her shopping!!! Oh, please! Give me a break! I just couldn't go on from there."
5,One of my all-time favs!,"I have read this book countless amount of times and it still never grows old! The characters are great, the story line is great, the plot is great. Everytime I need a good book to read, I always revert back to ""Sweet Liar"". I can scarcely put it down!"
