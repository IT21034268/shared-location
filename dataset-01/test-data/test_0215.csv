4,Favorite Read for Jude's Fans,"SWEET LIAR is a favorite of Deveraux fans. Samantha Elliot travels to New York from her Louisville home to locate a trace of a grandmother who'd disappeared when Sam was a baby.Her landlord, Michael Taggert becomes the love of her life and he helps her untangle a life that went wrong on a bloody night in 1928. The mystery gets lost, but the story flows for a rapid read.Nash Black, a Kentucky author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
4,Sweet Liar is Great,"This is one of my favorite Jude Deveraux books, besides the time travel ones. I would definately recommend this book because it intertwines mystery with romance."
5,Good Choice for a Sushi Cookbook,"I purchased this as a present for my 24 year old nephew. At first, I was surprised and a bit underwhelmed by its size. It's a big, heavy book. But the photographs are absolutely beautiful, and there are lots of them. That seems essential for a sushi cookbook where the visual impression is as important as the taste. I can't speak to the taste, but the recipes sounded good even to a non-sushi lover like me, and they didn't sound too complicated. Despite its size, it was one of the things my nephew carried with him (rather than ship) on his flight home after the holidays. In these days of limits on baggage, that says something I think."
3,Totally impractical.,"Wow stunning photos but what a lousy cookbook. If you like looking at pictures of sushi, this book is for you. If you like actually eating or making sushi, then this huge book is totally impractical in the kitchen."
4,Great Detail!,"This book was very helpful to learn advanced formatting techniques, straighten out formulas and other spreadsheet techniques. It was only difficult to follow the macros directions. I would suggest purchasing a beginning book just on that for those with no experience in VBA, because if you're a beginner, like me, then you will probably get frustrated. Other than that, I found the book to be thorough, clear and concise."
4,I am always pleased with Amazon,We love to hear George play but were a little disappointed that it was so short.
3,Not a great value,"This toy was a bit smaller than I had hoped it would be. I gave it 3 stars overall, only because my children love it. I on the other hand am tired of putting pieces back on that break off. (The ones that I can anyway.)"
3,"Its a bit hard to open, but my son loves it!","My son loves Mack and Lightning McQueen. Before he has this toy, he would use his Fisher Price truck and pretend that is Mack. So he was really excited when I get this truck. The only complaint about this toy is that the truck, Mack is hard for children's little hands to open. He has to keep asking us to open and close it for him, but he carries it everywhere and is very happy with it."
3,Thought it was something else,When I bought this online I originaly thought it was the bigger mack truck play set. Its not! Very small. Good thing I got it cheap. The price theyre charging now i wouldnt pay. But I guess the toy its self isnt bad. Kids had fun with it.
4,Great Fun,"Bought this for my three year old son for Christmas. He loves Cars and I thought this would be perfect. I was right. He really enjoys playing with it and he and grandpa played with it for quite some time. He particularly likes the car wash. As others have noted, it's a bit flimsy in some areas. And make sure you buy cars to go along with it. Especially Lightning! That was my son's first question after we opened it Christmas morning, Where's Lightning? Luckily Lightning was in the next box."
3,Not that impressed,"I have a lot of the other cars toys, and we love them. However this truck I was a little disappointed with. It's smaller then expected and not as well built as the other cars toys. The truck bed sticks all the time and my 3 year old gets frustrated when he can't open the truck. Once opened he does play with it from time to time. I guess it was my high expectations of this toy that made me rate it at only a 3."
3,Great division book!,I was able to use this book for an evaluation. It fit into my lesson plans wonderfully. The students thought it was very good.
1,Freezes up under Windows XP,"I've used Omnipage since version 9, and always it has been the same story--Good software that is a nightmare to install. The best advice is to wait until the first patch comes out.I've installed and reinstalled this version numerous times, always with the same result--it works once, then freezes up after that.Don't look for help from Scansoft support. Although there are messages posted describing this problem, there's no fix.Not good."
2,not clear it's worth the upgrade from 11,"I like the new batch mechanism, which has an ""output file per input file"" option. I haven't particularly noticed a stability problem (Win2K SP4 + OP12 SP1/2). However, the deal with the PDFs is this: when OP12 reads an image PDF, it will only save such PDFs as grayscale (if you ask for image/image+text), and OP12 can only save grayscale/color PDFs at 150dpi. Hence, if you have bi-level input PDFs at >150dpi resolution, you get enormous, ugly 150dpi grayscale output PDFs. On the other hand, OP12 can handle high resolution TIFFs just fine (i.e., it will save them as image/image+text PDFs with the correct resolution). This makes absolutely no sense and is a big step backward from OP11. As the other reviewer notes, they appear not to have any intention of fixing this in OP12."
2,This ain't the John Irving from Cider House Rules,"This is simply a warning for those of you, like myself, who absolutely love ""The Cider House Rules"", and are interested in seeing what else John Irving has to offer. This film is an adaptation of Irving's book, ""A Widow for One Year"". As with all of Irving's works, he loves writing emotions. This film deals primarily with the emotions of sensuality and sexuality and with a swift broad jump, crossed my comfort line quickly. The film is getting mixed reviews, some overwhelmed by Jeff Bridges' performance, others appalled by the lewdness of the film. If you want to see Bridges act, there's plenty of great films out there for you to enjoy. Take a pass on this."
2,Didn't do justice for the novel at all!,"The door in the floor is based on the novel, ""A Widow for One Year"" by John Irving which was an amazing novel and one of Irving's best to date. The book is broken into three seperate sections, or time frames, and ""The Door in the Floor"" covers the first section, or more elaboratly, the first 100 or so pages of the 500 plus page book. For the section of the novel that was covered in the two hour movie, it was a great movie, however this is the type of movie that really irritates avid readers who like to see the characters they read and love on the screen. The movie doesn't even touch on 400 plus pages of the novel leaving anyone who read the novel bitter and wanting for more and for those that didnt read the novel there is a sense of wanting as well as the starting section is a huge build up to what is to come latter in the novel that viewers will never know about or how important what they saw really was."
3,Well It was Okay,"It was interesting to find out how the time machine came to be and yes the name is misleading as Conrad from the series is nowhere to be found.The book itself was okay. Most of the story could have been written in two long chapters and a lot of if seems to be filler. While the story has an ending, it was sort of unsatisifying as if there will be a sequel in the future. To be honest I cant make heads or tail of this book. I sort of liked it, but it was too short, too much of it dealing with the ... escapades of the principals and then seems to end at the point where it could get interesting.If you like the Conrad series, I would buy this book just to know how the time machine came to be and who is Conrad's American cousin.If you never read the Conrad series, please dont read this book until you read the series first."
2,DIdn't last long,"My snakes really liked the light and came out of their hide holes to explore more but, the bulb only last 11 days before going out."
5,Does just what I wanted,"Bought two of these Red reptile bulbs for my mobile chicken coup because it's winter, and we are getting some below freezing temperatures. Altthough I didn't want to cause the chickens to lose their ability to adapt to the cold, I wanted to put something in the coop to slightly warm it, and try to keep it above 30 degrees. I had a regular 60 watt bulb in the coop, but it was so bright the chickens couldn't sleep at night, so I searched for something with less light, but strong heat. This fit the bill perfectly!! It is just bright enough to put out a soft red glow, but provides slightly more heat than the regular 60 watt bulb. Now, my chickens can sleep, and I can still hold the temperature above 29 degrees. Egg production even went up since I put this in the coop."
2,Too old,I purchased this book because it listed the publish date as 2005. It is actually a reprint from 1983. The information is ok but outdated.
2,Too flowery without substance,"This is written in very flowery language without getting to the point. For that I did not finish reading it. It does not hold ones interest as you bypass all the picturesque vocabulary that does not express the message well. Great title, great people chosen to write about, but the means to the end was not in keeping with the reader's interest."
3,The Book of Missionary Heros,"While antiquated in its style of writing,it is still amazing and inspiring what early missionaries endured for the spread of the Gospel. And knowing that even today, men and women endure great hardships still!"
2,Brian has let us down badly.,This CD is really very average and certainly does not deserve 5 stars. People who give it 4-5 stars have lost the plot.Overall this is very childish and wishy washy. Some of the tunes are taylor made for Barry Manilow and one particular track could have been the theme tune for the My Little Pony series(my daughter used to watch it).I have given this a fair hearing 20-25 times in the car and still cant find a way to like it. Pet sounds should not be mentioned as this is an excuse at trying to make music. A little secret. Try Tears for Fears Every Body Loves a Happy Ending and you will hear the new up to date Pet Sounds. If Brian could have made a CD like this I could understand the 5 star ratings.As it is this is not good enough background music to hang wall paper to.
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Brian Wilson is a living legend. But if it was anyone else releasing this album, it might have been rejected by the record company. The one high point is Carl Wilson's lead vocal on ""Soul Searchin"" ( check out Solomon Burke's version released a couple of years ago). Wilson certainly deserves all the accolades that have come his way in the last decade, but this is sad and sometimes painful to listen to. For Wilson fanatics only."
3,Love: New Age style,"If you loved Jonathan Livingston Seagull and are looking for more of the same, you may be a bit disappointed by ""The Bridge Across Forever.""The story chronicles the steps (and missteps) Bach made in his personal and financial relationships. And this makes for a wonderful and sometimes tragic, love story.Unfortunately, the story is wrapped up in a new-age wrapping of time travel and out of body experiences. Bach's mistake is that he describes these experiences, and, in fact, the entire book as a ""true story."" So, even though very well written and interesting, it will probably not appeal to those skeptics who deplore real-life spiritual encounters in their pleasure reading.Overall, a decent read, but be prepared for spiritual overtones. And, if you believe in soulmates, this book may be right up your alley.I give this 1 star for the spiritual overtones and 3 or 4 stars for the story."
2,Seems pretty useless now,I read this book three years ago after reading illusions and Jonathan; wich were both great. I really liked Bridge Accross Forever but I consider it useless as an inspirational read if Richard himself says that while writing the book he saw that the relationship was not going to work out.Why was he writing the book then? Simply to make money? I recomend Jonathan and Illusions; there is no point reading his later books now.
2,Does not have range,This antenna has a 100 mile range per the technical specifications. All stations are less than 50 miles from my home. I got only one station out of 30 or so I was supposed to get.
2,Small stories that seem interminable,"Various stories difficult to read not due to a use of an old fashion or classic style, but because many are a bore and sad. The gay relationships are however interesting to follow, to know and to understand."
4,A tai chi movie?,"This is probably the only movie that comes any close in its depiction of the actual practice of Tai Ji Quan. There is a lot of silence, character developement is very subtle. I gave it 4 stars, because if it d be anymore subtle, the movie would just have to stop all together. So Im giving it 4 stars and a thank you for keeping on moving to a happy resolution. He finds a chick;)"
2,did not get what the picture shows,"I was so happy to see someone had the ""Hearty Chicken Flavor"" cup a noodles soup,when I received it,it was just the regular ""chicken"" flavor that I can get anywhere.I spoke to the very nice seller who said that Amazon put the wrong picture up.I don't know."
5,Good book,It was a very interesting book. I have the first novel and wanted to read the second and third. Good reading.
5,The best punch I have ever purchased,I have had several punches throughout the years. Each one of them was a keychain and over a month or two it would become loose and I would loose a piece of it. This punch does not break down into pieces so it is very durable.
2,ok,nothing exciting. it will teach you basic salsa steps. no one even smiles. it will get your heart rate slightly elevated if you don't normally dance.
1,Way more standing around then actual exercise,"I have done other dancing videos and love the cardio dancing with the stars. This one however is awful. They spend twice the time trying to explain the complicated steps then actually working out. I did this work out this morning, and then had to do another one just to feel like I worked out."
5,Be sure you know what you are buying.,"In order that no others make the same mistake be sure that you have an IEEE-1394/Firewire port on your computer. This is NOT a USB cable, nor are the cameras that they are designed for.The good news is that adapter boards are readily available for your computer and/or laptop that will allow you to utilize this device.Have both the 4/4 and 4/6 varieties of this product and they function flawlessly. The large ferrite beads at both ends help keep the signal clean."
3,A decent zombie movie,"Now, take note that I am a huge fan of ZOMBIE-SURVIVAL movies, I couldn't give a crap if a zombie movie had loads and loads of gore, what fascinates me is how the survivors survive, and what the rest of the world is going through when this is all happening. Believe it or not, this movie actually did satisfy all of my needs, although they may have did it with below-average acting, this is a pretty decent zombie SURVIVAL movie."
1,How about a Zero star option?,"This movie is beyond horrible. From the cap gun weapons, to the bad acting, to it having no perceptible plot. I wish I could get back the time and money I wasted on this movie. Stay away at all costs!"
1,Bad isn't a strong enough word.,"From a production standpoint, this may be the worst movie ever made. Still, it might be good for some cheesy laughs right? Nope...I can not think of a single reason for anyone to watch this piece of garbage."
1,It has to be really bad to be on MST3k.,"This is one of the best episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and the better the episode the worse the movie. The show did a good job at pointing out all of the mistakes of the movie. Joe Esteves did a terrible job in that movie. The plot was terrible and did not make sense. This was film was very boring. I got tired of seeing that guy run around the hospital. I even read Blockbuster Video's review for this movie. They used just one word to describe this film and that was 'tedious.' If you buy this film and then watch it, you will be bored to tears. If you only watch it on MST3k, you will laugh your head off. As I said before, the better the episode the worse the movie."
1,...,"...The premise starts out good enough - Four modern day kids loving life, drinking, driving, all of a sudden get in a fatal car crash. Two of the group get their souls collected by the soultakers while the hero and heroine manage to avoid capture.The Soultaker uses this rubber ""O"" ring set in the palm of the hand to extract an individual's soul. From there, it goes into his jacket pockeet for safekeeping.The acting, at best, is that of a high school drama. The sets: a county fair and a dark hospital with no one working..."
3,A Sleeper that's Better than they say...,"This movie is the very definition of what a sleeper is. It's sort of creepy and sort of weird, but it's different. There are definitely some great moments and classic lines to make up for the low budget.I was not surprised to find out that it won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror when it first came out. I enjoyed the uncut version that the Sci Fi Channel aired to begin with.Then MST3K got a hold of it and shredded it and roasted it. That was sort of funny, but didn't do the movie justice."
4,Battleship hits its target,"Battleship starts out slowly with some predictable character study moments, setting the stage for later heroics. As hero Stone Hopper (Taylor Kitsch - John Carter) and his naval buddies do their duty for country and for Earth against mysterious aliens, the action builds with the technology of both sides providing spectacular effects. The film makers did a decent job of including the human elements of heroism, duty, humanity, and humility, as the characters fight the aliens in bigger and bigger battles. When the battleship Missouri is brought into the conflict, you can't help but feel proud that a few of these awe-inspiring ships still exist. You always know the good guy humans will win, but seeing how is a fun voyage with great special effects, reasonable dialog and characters, and final scenes that make viewers feel the gratitude that all our military heros deserve."
3,McHale's Navy on Steroids,A no thought needed movie to just sit back and be entertained by the recidivous. You have seen this premiss hundreds of times but somehow it still strikes an inner cord...the good guy wins.
2,Pearl Harbor Redeux,"Do you remember the movie Pearl Harbor with Ben Affleck? Great eye candy but a truly bad, bad movie.Well, Hollywood did it again.....Battleship. They took what could have been a fun popcorn movie and turned it into a mashup of ridiculous motivations, unbelievable emotional situations, bad acting, bad writing, and bad direction. If you watch the movie without fast-forwarding when you finish you'll feel like you need a shower and will desperately want your 2+ hours back. Really, it's not even worth a bucket of warm spit!"
4,Battleship is a trip,"I think back to when I took my youngest son to see Independence Day. After it was over, I realized how dumb it was and I really felt guilty over how much I enjoyed it. Oh, and my son loved it too.Well Battleship is in that same category. I must say it takes about 30 minutes for the action to start but when it does ,there's no let up. It's just a rockem sockem good time .Expect some great CGI. So, Sit back ,grab some pop corn,and let the movie take over."
3,Glad I waited for the video,"Stilted, mediocre acting/plot almost compensated for by the pretty good special effects.Movie is, essentially, a Navy recruiting film targeting adolescents."
4,Not That Bad,"I know the movie did not get good reviews from critics, but it was fun to watch. Glad I did not pay to see it in a theater."
2,"NO, no no.","That main character that ruined the movie John Carter. Yeah, that guy. He ruins this one too... He just does."
3,Too Much CGI,"I like this movie because the music makes it great, but it seems like Peter Berg uses the same kind of music that Jon Favreau uses for the Iron Man movies. The acting is not at it's best, but I do appreciate the premise behind this Hasbro inspired flick!"
3,Not Bad!,"Better than expected -- kid friendly, and a fun ride. Not an award winner by any stretch, but a great popcorn movie!"
1,It was...,"a movie. That's about all I can say about it, other than if there were a zero star option, I'd give it that."
1,waste of money....get PPV!,"OMG! The most unbelievable storyline, worst actors, lame hour-and half I ever wasted.The Blu-Ray disc in this combo pack was defective and I have an Oppo Blu-Ray player!You can rent this on DISH PPV or Amazon and I will NEVER buy a movie before I first watch it PPV.Awful flick!"
1,just bad all around.,"The story was nearly as bad as the acting. This movie could have really been good. The chezzy stuff Hollywood puts in this movie is really pathetic. We were disappointed with this. Glad we only rented it. Felt like I was watching a show for 10 year olds, sort of like Super friends, or the old TV Batman. Pick another."
5,Exciting,This was well done and exciting. Good tension between the actors and some cute moments lighten the drama. Fun evening movie.
4,Good movie,Love this movie it was full of action not much story am happy to recommend it if you are a action buff
2,"Stupid, stupid guilty ""pleasure""","Ok, so it's dumb. You knew it was gonna be dumb. And you (probably) got exactly what you expected. Interesting special effects, howlingly bad dialogue and plot. But hey, you weren't expecting Shakespeare. If you enjoyed Transformers and independence day you'll like this one. Go ahead and watch it. I won't tell anyone. Shhhh....."
2,bad acting,"Concept was good, the acting was terrible and the movie is so long. I was counting down the minutes until it was over."
3,An interesting diversion,"A fun movie with a lot of good technical effects. The aliens have some very interesting distructive weapons that they use, who ever thought these up was very creative. Our society could use some of them to tear down old structures that need to be torn down."
3,Destroy the Missouri?,"I buy into most of this movie, but cannot believe that some alien scum could destroy the USS Missouri. That part is a little far fetched. Seriously, it's descent mindless entertainment, but a little to similar to computer FX movies like Armageddon."
1,No story line,If you like action with no story to worry about this is your movie. I personally like some story with my movies
3,Battleship,"Just a good action packed fun movie. We will watch it again to catch what we missed, and just because it's fun."
4,Review - Battleship,"I watch each movie without having read any reviews prior to have no assumptions or bias; this way I can watch the movie and I am either surprised in a good or bad way.In this case, I was entertained, the movie held my attention, the plot not overly complex, the action scenes and graphics realistic.The enemy, defense, weapons were nothing new but the strategy utilized during and toward the end was a testament to the way things were built to last and ultimately it is the oldest, least technical solution that overpowers the more technical alien race - as with all such movies we are far behind in every way imaginable.We are so far behind it is questionable as to why the highly advanced civilizations out there would waste their time. This is different spin on how we defend and ultimately save the world once again and I found the movie to be sad, but also humorous.The movie has multiple emotional responses from extreme sad to romance and plenty of firepower and interesting weapons."
2,Rent it,"Soon as I heard my boy from True Blood trying hard to push an american accent I knew this movie would not be worth my time. Acting sucks from everyone accept the aliens, but the effects were the only thing that got an extra star from me. Trust me. Rent it. Put is not collection worthy."
3,battleship,I gave this flim a 3 1/2star for all the action from start to end. It has a story line that flows
5,One of the greatest summer blockbusters ever,"Let's not confuse the issue here: this isn't ""Ghandi"" or ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" or ""The Artist."" It's a hang on to your suspension of belief, big Hollywood, blockbusting, metal crushing, Alien butt kicking summer movie that isn't way over the top or goofy under-done. And, they found creative ways to work in the classic concepts of the Hasbro game that won't make you groan. It's a fun summer movie that fits every expectation of what that means."
1,A very expensive and silly Navy commercial,"Not much real substance or originality in this 'film'.Great special effects (and perhaps worth watching it for free for that alone) but it just feels like a long winded fantasy commercial for the US Navy.Big surprise, the rough 'makes his own rules' Lt who also is in love with the Admiral's daughter ends of saving the world. Blah...Oh, and not once did someone say, ""You sank my Battleship!"" I might have given an extra star just for that! heh"
4,An underrated movie,"I'm not a fan of cheap, cheesy science fiction. That said, I think this movie was highly underrated. The comments of it being a Transformer ripoff are unfounded. No giant robots walking around blowing things up. Other than turning a museum into a functioning warship that quick the plot was believable in the realm of good science fiction. I know it won't happen but I'd like to see a sequel"
3,Fun Movie,"The movie was a fun action/ adventure type to watch. Entertaining. Girlfriend fighting aliens with vet was kind of cliche-ish. Again though, fun movie."
3,Battle scenes great,"The kids enjoyed for the action, but the storyline not too feasible. How did Hopper go from a free-loader brother to a Navy officer so quick??"
3,Good but not great movie,"Good action movie. Nothing heavy, just good entertainment. It is nice to see that the screen writer pulled a naval maneuver from the war of 1812."
3,Better than Battle Los Angeles and worth watching!,"For many of you that thought Battle Los Angeles was just okay, this movie does surpass it in a way and I was glad to see a movie where finally the Navy takes the lead. Liam Nielson is in it but you don't get a lot of his character and not really a lot from Rhianna though both are present in the film. Both had small but mediocre parts and or lines. However, they did have some nice actions parts in the movie and at least you can see the alien, which resembles some type of human animal cross-over. This movie gets three stars because in my opinion they could have taken that great start of the movie and went further. Not to spoil it too much for the rest of you but there could be a part 2 (but highly doubt it) in the future."
1,too contrived,"A sad day for the motion picture arts! Battleship appears to be the work of simpletons for an easily duped population of moviegoers. The script is childish and the computer generated effects were sloppy. Oh yes, the acting was crap!I walked away from this one feeling completely cheated."
4,Glad to see it again!,"I was happy to see the most exciting scenes of the movie again. I liked the initial response of the aliens with a sonic boom! The theory is old, communicating evil intent telepathically. I liked the alien ordnance that looked like pegs from the actual game. I would recommend it!"
3,Battleship,"Battleship was a Fun movie, certainly kept me awake throughout. Although the story line lacked a little it did have lots of action, a little romance and as my husband said, loud!"
5,Battleship is the Best,Battleship is a great movie it's the best alien invasion movie that I believe takes the gold It so real and the picture quality is tremendous
1,death by boredom and rihanna,"I started a new hobby while watching BS (yep, exactly how it suggests)...cutting myself. I started running out of veins but then it ended so now I need pills to help me forget."
5,Great story line and wow factor!,"The story has a few twists that contribute to great action story. Battleship is the right name for this movie. The aliens were conceived in a new way and the point of ""just what in the world do we expect to happen if we contact alien worlds"" is given an interesting answer. Watch it!"
3,Its ok,"Well, I rented this and found it to be kind of boring in a way, the action was ok but, and its my fault, I thought this movie would be a bit better in story line :-)I would watch it again if I wanted a silly action movie to watch but I wouldn't purchase it."
4,action pack movie,the movies was action pack and the sound and video were both excellent on my plasma tv and surround sound system for a video rental.
2,"how this is getting good review, i'll never know.","relatively high production value.. crap acting, crap writing, infeasible scenarios *even* taking into account the suspension of disbelief this type of movie demands... ugh... i could likely write pages and pages about why it was such a crap movie, but it was SUCH crap - i just don't have the energy to devote.Good for a laugh though..."
2,"Wait until it comes out on TV, not even worth a $1 rental.","Not impressed at all with this movie. Reminded me of a very bad knock off of Independence Day, which is an awesome movie. If you want to see Battleship, wait until it comes out on regular tv."
3,OK Movie,"Character development & plot were a bit thin, overwhelmed by too much special effects. Still adequately entertaining, but nothing beyond that."
3,Battling Something,"It took a short while to figure out why they called it Battleships. It wasn't really the Battleship they used, but the grid style for the buoys that told the name. That and the person saying ""Miss"".Action was good in the movie. Overall I would say it was a good movie. Not worth owning, and definitely worth trying to rent at a cheaper price."
5,ACTION,"THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION, A GREAT STORY AND I LOVE TO SEE US DEFEAT ALIENS, FRON ANOTHER PLANET. BILL"
4,Transformers for the big kids,Loved every minute of it. Fun and exciting from beginning to end. Won't spoil one of the BEST battle scenes for you. You'll just have to watch. GREAT fun!!
2,"God, I so wanted this movie to be good.","For God's sake don't buy it! It's worth borrowing it from somebody or rent it. I won't go into the plot or acting, there are plenty of reviews out there for that."
3,Maybe I'm jaded ...,"but ""formula"" action adventures need something extra - more than Battleship did - to get past three stars. I found it difficult to relate to the testosterone-driven characters."
3,Love story,Pretty good for a love story. Special effects were decent. Some of the scenery was nice too. If the sequel was REALLY well written and acted I would buy it.
3,Decent movie if you like special affects.,"Great movie for the affects, but the story line left a little to be realistic. If you like this kind of movie, rent it and let me know what you think."
1,Defective Blu-ray disc,"There is some problem with the Blu-ray disc. Seems to be for Chapters 1 & 2 only. Rest of the chapters are ok. Tried this on 2 different Blu-ray (different brands) players. The show keeps ""pausing"" for a few seconds after every few minutes. In Chapter 1, the strange ""pausing"" begins when Hopper looks through the glass door of the convenience store (for the chicken burrito). In Chapter 2, it happens as Hopper kicks the ball during the penalty kick. Once it happens (both locations) it keeps at it for a good 3-5 minutes then automatically skips to the next chapter! Anyone else encountered this problem?"
1,bad,"its bad, like really bad. the charterers had no thought processes, no common sense. there was so many holes in the story. dialog? nope. had none, there was no real military tactics at all and how is it that the battle ship that's bin parked since the war is fully fueled and armed? and some how ran by a elderly skeleton crew.. this movie should of never bin made."
4,Surprisingly enjoyable!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't want to watch it because everyone had panned the movie but my mom, sister-in-law and her children, my friends and my children really enjoyed it. It just goes to show we should check out things on our own.I definitely should have seen this in the movie theater. It was pretty good. Is it great? NO! It is a leave your brain outside the door sci-fi movie and I liked the alien spin on it. It was a bit slow in the beginning but they were just setting up the characters. There were some truly funny moments in the beginning. As the movie went on, I really began to love the characters.I am glad I had a change of heart in deciding to watch it. Normally if I don't watch a big blockbuster in the movie, I don't watch it at home either. I lose all interest even if its 10 years down the line. If you haven't seen it, check it out! It's a big fun movie."
4,Don't be picky about plot hiccups...,"Saw it on 12 inch pc screen. Special effects were good and it would have been better to see it in theatre, for the full effect. Not a classic but worth more viewings."
3,Pure action,Ok movie if you want some easy entertainment and a fast action pace movie. A little bit fake but hey it's all sci-fi action what can you expect
2,Battleship,"Battleship was good for what it was, a special effects movie. Acting was fine but nothing to get an award for."
3,Fun movie,Fun movie to watch. Complex subject would require several movies to build great charcters and plots. Would be great as a movie series. Should build off this and make another movie.
3,A Bit Better than Average,"Generally well done. Wish Liam Neeson had been given a bigger part. The special effects are spectacular, but the script is lacking and character development is shallow at best. The use of the US Battleship Missouri in the story-line was inspired but not particularly well executed."
4,exciting,Kept me interested throughout even though my husband picked this movie. I thought this was a new approach to aliens. I didn't realize it was based on a game until my husband pointed it out.
5,Awesome,"This was a great movie. I used it on my Kindle Fire while I was flying to Chicago and it kept me interested the whole time and made the flight go by very quickly. Since I have it on my Kindle, I can watch it again. Outstanding movie!!!!"
4,"Sure, it's a little silly but...",...this movie snob found herself generally engaged with the movie and even shed a tear or two near the end. I love a good action flick but that's just it - good action is sometimes hard to find. This wasn't bad at all and certainly better than most of the goofy crud offered lately.Go ahead and spend the few bucks on it - add some popcorn and kick your feet up for a nice few hours of distraction.
4,Entertaining,"Fun movie! Very entertaining with action, romance, good vs evil and a big surprise with Eric (favorite vampire from True Blood). It is not thought provoking, but fun!!!!"
5,"This Movie is a feel good ""sleeper"" !","while this movie did not do well in the box office IT is truly a GREAT movie! Rarely do I talk about movies, so here goes: this movie is actually based (loosely) on the game ""Battleship"". You will notice ""Hasbro"" in the beginning. The story line is obviously science fiction but the movie has a bunch of fantastic special effects 7 incredible HD sound. The end of the movie is very American and very moving especially for veterans like me. My son told me to get this movie, I am glad I did ! You will enjoy this movie ! Pay attention & you will see original game ""hints"" & visuals too.... I will enjoy this movie over & over...."
3,good action,"very unexpected - generally good action but some crappy ""B"" acting - story line was engaging but happy I didn't pay to see it at movie theatre"
3,Good Movie. Could have been great.,"This was an entertaining movie. It could've been great with the budget and the actors they had, but it seems like they dumbed the story down to appeal to a wider age range and it damaged the quality of the film. It was good, but good in the kind of way where you spend the whole time focusing on how it had the potential to be great."
2,Big on graphics but not much else......,Actually I was shocked Liam Neeson had such a minimal role....not much to this movie other than computer generated effects.
3,"Heavy on Action, Short on Plot","If you'd like to sit down and enjoy visual effects and explosions, this is the film for you. The ""love"" story is there, but it follows the typical Hollywood formula. Rihanna was a pleasant surprise as a spunky naval officer with some fight."
5,"Suspence, Action, Fun, and Patriotic!","FUN movie! I have learned now that whatever movies the critics rate poorly is actually a GOOD movie! (and the reciprocal is also true!). No wonder the critics hated this, it reflected our military in a positive light!"
4,Pure escapist fun.,"This flick was better than I had expected it to be, perhaps because it did so poorly in the theaters. Perfect for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon matinee at home."
1,"Great battle scenes, BUT...",Great movie but poor HD picture quality. It's a waste of money. I'm way better off renting a Blueray disc.
3,OK movie,"OK movie I watched it on a flight from Anchorage to Seattle. Just OK, no big awards for this one. Sci Fi, OK plot, OK animation....just OK."
1,What a bunch of malarky,"From the opening to the climax, this dog has so many ""issues"" that it detracts from the outstanding effects. Since when did the navy start issuing commissions to recently released convicts and how did he make it to Lt in such a short time? And the retired battleship just happened to have a full load of hot ordnance onboard? Gimme a break. The truly sterling stars of the show were the double amputee army vet and the former crewmen who work the ship on display. I wouldn't pay more than $2 to watch the dvd and only then on a cold winter night when I was bored and wanted some comedy."
2,Battleship,The movie it's ok but can't watched perfectly and couldn't heart it. I do not going to order another movie again.
1,BORING!,"Liam Neeson should be ashamed for having lent his name and face to this disaster, even if only for 10 minutes.The CG is great, but that's about it. The plot's not new and there was no acting of any note.I thought the idea of using actual veterans was cool, but then the rest of the movie was so not Navy. I give the veterans 5 stars and the movie 0."
3,Don't Bitger,Not as good as I expected. Would wait until it is on television. There was a lot of action though.
3,Flawed but entertaining,"Silly, stupid and requires an incredible amount of suspension of disbelief. Fun to watch, just check your sense of ""that makes sense"" at the door. Utterly ridiculous in it's science and theories, but lots of good alien stuff, if that's what you crave (I do).."
3,An Enchanting Adaption of the Classic Fairy Tale!,"If you enjoyed the Walt Disney version, you are sure to enjoy this spectacular Faerie Tale Theatre version. Bernadette Peters plays the very sweet and gentle princess who has been under a curse for 20 years, and then the curse comes true. Beverley D'Angelo is excellent as the wicked fairy Henbane. Christopher Reeve is quite good as the handsome Prince. And Carol Kane is magical as the Good Fiary. You'll love the comedic lines, the romance, the scariness and the magic of a heartwarming fairy tale adventure."
5,Superb,Read and reccomended to a number of friends. Any of Jeff Cox's storyline style books are not only fun to read but an enjoyable learning experience. If youu like this then also try Quadrant Solution and The Goal...all very good
4,A Becoming Book,"Linda Greenhouse writes clearly and with the deep knowledge of an expert court watcher. Her book is highly recommended for any citizen trying to make heads or tails of the escalating political debate over the looming nomination to fill the next vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Roe v. Wade is key and this book explains how it has reached this point.While Justice Blackmun's obsessive keeping of all letters, notes, and other written material made this book possible, I question if it is good for the high court for others to follow in his tracks, at least in terms of early release of such information. It seems fellow justices and clerks will now write everything, even minor notes, with the thought that the public will be viewing all material exchanged in as early as five years from the death of a particular justice. I think it better for the court's public voice to be from the bench."
5,Great stuff. You will not be disappointed!,"If you like to gather information about NWO, watch it.You will not be disappointed.Recomended!!!"
1,Terrible Boots,"I purchased these boots at Mills Fleet Farm, usually known to sell quality products. These boots should be pulled off the shelf right now! I paid $47.00 for these boots and they are worth $5.00. I have had them for one month and walked thru the snow covered forests 15 days out of that month. The imitation leather, ""yes that is what these boots are made of, what a JOKE"" is coming off, the interior fabric on the inside of the imitation leather is breaking down and the interior of the boot where your feet are placed is also completly breaking down. Do Not waste you money on these boots period. And if you shop at Fleet Farm tell the manager to not sell these boots. MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE"
1,Wasted Money,"I bought this leash for my daughter's new puppy. I bought it for a large dog, since the puppy is a Lab/Rot mix, but the puppy only weighs 30 pounds now. Within two weeks we had to throw this in the trash. The leash itself broke twice. We had to tie it back together. My husband took the handle apart and fixed it twice. This was a waste of our money!"
2,Waechtersbach dinnerware,"Although these dishes are lovely to look at and come in such a wonderful array of colors, they chip VERY easily and are quite heavy. When they become too chipped to use anymore I will buy something else."
5,Ohhhh! Me so sorry!,"This movie, while it may try to be very suspenseful (and actually does succeed in doing so) is an absolute riot! Ever wanted to see what would happen to Charlie Sheen if he ever went without sleep? Well, this is the movie for you! I cannot wait to see this movie again! Very underrated and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than it received.Charlie Sheens best performance. Ever."
3,Don't move next to my house!!!!,A crazy psyco-thriller that is a little slow in the beginning but at the end has a lot of twist and turns.
4,don't have one but it is cool,This is the first wireless controller that has a radio signal so if somthing is in the way it still works. well the only flaw is that there is no rumble feature which is good because the batterys won't get all sucked up. Well I Highly recommend this for gamecube fans and normal people.
3,Wavebird sucks after the first week or so...,"I'm an avid gamer. I love video games. But when i bought this, i was like ""omg, this is so cool"". but now, this thing [stinks]. when the battery life is running low, the reciever wont get any signal that you pushed a button, so you'll be playing ssbm and in the middle of an intense fight, and the batterys give out, and your character is being knocked back and forth..."
5,This wirebird rules!,"I was showing my dad the wirebird. First, I turned away from the gamecube. It worked. Then, I turned the gamecube the other way and I turned around so I was facing away from the tv. It still worked. No matter where you are in the room it will work (within 20 feet.) even if the gamecube is facing in another direction. If you dont have it, you MUST buy it."
2,Horrible book,"Very disappointing recipes. One look at the savoiardi recipe's ingredient proportions and you can tell you wouldn't get a batter in the end, but enriched powder. Tried it anyway, and I was right. The amaretto expresso cheesecake turned into sweet sloppy joe the both times I tried that recipe, and I'm a cooking instructor. This book is a waste of time."
3,Cadet usually has a good bag of the chicken breast fillet .... but ...,"The last batch that I received were very brittle. I know that crunchy or hard is great for keeping dog teeth clean. But, I have a small dog approx. 7-8lbs who does not like it even in small pieces. I prefer to give them the dried meat products for strong muscles. The packages that are sold at the stores are far more expensive, so for the price, I will tolerate the brittleness of their favorite food."
2,Good BUT could be better!,"My two pugs love these chicken strips!However, the packaging is so bad I have to move them into another container after opening. The supposed resealable bag doesn't reseal. Go figure!Also, in the last year the individual strips (fresh right out of the bag) have become too large, too hard, and way too brittle in texture for my two guys.Time to find another brand, of which there are several!Mark"
3,spray paint,OK I think this is one item I should have bought locally. Turned out that one can had a fault nozzle so that one was wasted and I wasnt of a mind to hassle with it.
5,Inspiring,I enjoyed reading about the life and legacy of Kathryn Kuhlman. The book is a nice easy read. I'm also inspired by Benny Hinn.
1,Broke first time,"Turned it on for the first time, poured in the base, and the dasher stopped spinning. The small gear on the motor snapped into pieces.This wasn't a case of of the dasher freezing, it spun fine by hand.P.O.S."
4,Birkenstock Sandals,"They're narrow and you need to be very careful because if you spill anything on them, the stain never goes away."
5,Favorite sandals,"They're birks. What more can you say? I've never tried the knock-offs. This is my second pair. I wear the soles out of them. High arches might pain you until you get them broke in. After that, each walk feels like a massage. Keep them dry, they will start getting nasty on the foot bed."
4,Birkenstock is the best,"I was born in Germany and always wore Birkenstock sandals. It took some time to convince my husband to try this sandal, now he love it and does not want any other sandal in the house."
3,Ok,"The product itself was as expected, except the size ran a little small. I had to return them and get the next size up, which was more complicated since I requested an exchange but got a refund, and had to re-order the larger size."
5,Best sandals I've ever had...,"As usual, Birkenstock did not dissapoint. It does take a little bit for these to break in, so tough it out for that short time. If you do, you will love them and wonder why you've ever had another pair! I have plantar faciitis in my foot and these are the only shoes that don't leave me crawling in pain. The arch support is fantastic. Buy them! It's worth the extra money!"
1,Not what is advertised,"This is NOT the original formulation as stated. I ordered 6 bottles based on statement that it contained the original ingredient Phenyltoloxamine Citrate; it DOES NOT---it has diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It's bad enough that you can no longer find the original, but to falsely advertise the original,only to ship the ""replacement"" is worse. I want to know why we can no longer get it----is replacement ingredient cheaper (if so, not passing that savings on), did another company buy out the original and decide to ""tinker""----what??? Anyway, buyer beware!"
3,It's party time!,"This is a CD single by Jim Carrey. It features the version of ""Cuban Pete"" he sang inThe Mask, plus a remixed version by C&C; Music Factory. In addition, it features ""Cuban Pete"" as performed by Desi Arnez on I Love Lucy, including an appearance by Lucille Ball as ""Sally Sweet"". There is also an unlisted fourth track, which consists of clips of Jim Carrey saying some of his lines from The Mask. Here is the complete track listing:1. Cuban Pete(Arkin Movie Mix)2. Cuban Pete(C&C; Pop Radio Edit)3. Cuban Pete(Desi Arnez Version)4. Clips from The Mask"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE!,Synopsis: Everyone wants everyone elses' man. The end.Rented this movie from Redbox. I have absolutely NOTHING positive to say about it. I don't know how I made it through the entire flick. Felt like I was watching an extended rap video/soft porn. Don't waste your time or money. You couldn't pay me to ever sit through this one again.
2,Disappointing,"The premise intrigued me: A man finds out about his neighbor's secret past of war crimes over 30 years earlier and reacts to that knowledge. Unfortunately, the book did not pull me in. I never really cared about any of the characters and was uninterested in the side-stories of advertising and having a son in minor league baseball. Truly, I feel I wasted my money on this book."
4,Can make you angry!,"An excellent resource and window into the lives that went on inside theses houses. The angry part happens when you read that when the 1975 edition was published, it was discovered that only 34 of the 100 houses noted in the 1941 edition were still standing (most due to incompetent planning and lack of developer foresight). In 2005, the record is even worse."
3,Whirry Makes This Flick ALMOST Worthwhile,"The plot really is weak (especialy the ending). Whirry, however, looks outstanding as always. She also shows that she has/had potential to actually be a serious actress. While she does not show nearly as much skin as Animal Instincts II, when she strips, this movie (among other things) picks up."
4,Good Book,My doctor recommended reading this book. I found the book to be very informative and the information was helpful to me. Even though the book is old it had a lot of insight.
2,Coles notes version of another self help book,"I have been studying Dr. Abraham Low's ""Mental Health Through Will Training,"" which is along the same lines as this book by Dr. Claire Weekes, which I just recently read. I find Dr. Low's book superior because it is more detailed, gives far more examples and more self help techniques. I am also a member of Dr. Low's Recovery Inc meetings, which have been a big help. The book by Dr. Weekes is ok if you are looking for a summary type book; for a ""full length"" version minus any religious references, go with Dr. Low."
5,Well written.,"I wouldn't really say this book is a how-to to overcoming Anxiety and stress, but it is definitely informative. It breaks down symptoms of anxiety, gives personal stories, and ways to cope. I'd recommend it."
5,there are 89 raving reviews about this book. now make it 90.,If you have read other people's reviews of this book they pretty much capture everything that is great about this book. I think that most of the reviews are so long because we all want more than anything to thank Dr. Weekes for saving our lives.We all get asked the question if you could have anyone in history over for dinner who would it be? My answer is absolutely Dr. Weekes but it wouldn't be because I was interested in picking her mind some more; it would simply be a dinner that I would have so lavishly prepared and serve to her in my greatest appreciation of her work. I would hope that she enjoyed every bite.The book really is that good.
1,Don't Use the Edge To Clean Your Spoon!,I ended up with pureed baby food with glass shards in it after tapping my spoon against the rim of the blender jar. Ack!!!!
3,The Picture is Kind of Misleading,"Each piece is no bigger than your thumb, and the presentation looked great. Each 'flavor' tasted the same, but maybe a little alterations that are not that noticeable. Came in a shiny cardboard box.Each cake tasted the same. At first, I was extremely upset when it started to taste like marshmallow. But more into it, it just tasted fluffy and sweet, and fattening... To make this short, I definitely don't think this is worth the $19 I paid + shipping. This is more like something you can eat within 20 minutes."
1,"plagiarist, Navajo wannabe, fake","I haven't read any of ""Nasdijj""'s writings, and I don't expect to do so, but as a REAL Amerind (Cherokee), I am disturbed and indignant at Navajos being used as a publicity hook by a white sado-masochist. Don't take my word for it. Read an exhaustive exposé athttp://www.laweekly.com/index.php option=com_lawcontent&task;=view&id;=12468&Itemid;=47"
3,The blood runs like a river through my dreams,"this was an ok book... i sometimes found it to be boring and repetative at times..but in the long run it was semi intreating and kept me wanting to read... throughout the book there were many refrences dealing with death, and after a certain amount of time started to become semi-depressing.. but the overall book was good and and i suggest reading it for anyone else who is looking for a good book"
1,Big mistake,I saw this here in a boutique in n.y.c. It seemed like a nice grocery bag initially.It was authentic and I thought the price was alright but I was sorry to have purchaced it after several weeks.I use it for ruff and tumble and the cloth got stained and scuffed and I gave it to the Salvation Army hoping maybe someone might like it and fix it up.Its best to do some reading reviews before buying stuff.
5,God Is Here,"Diana Long's simple title: ""God is Here"" appeals to adults and children alike - it bring us to the simple truth that: GOD IS HERE!! I highly recommend it."
4,Well known writers are talking about this...,"Well known writers and T.V. stars are talking about purpose and self-worth. Diana Long sums up the same message in a delightfully simple way with her book God is Here.Give the gift of her message, with love, to yourself - and everyone else you care about too!"
4,Newspaper-like telling of some new facts and theories,"This book is certainly worth reading. It's written like a newspaper article, using simple concepts and phrases. I wish it had been better at listing its sources. There are many listed at the end of the book (broken down by chapter), but at times it's difficult to see exactly what is attributed to what source.As to the theories expressed by the book, they are simply that - theories. However they do provide some interesting pieces of data, and another way of looking at the incident."
1,Down for the count,"So. . . let me get this straight. At a time when Red China had no operational submarines armed with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, we are supposed to believe the Soviets were dumb enough to develop a plan to fire a ballistic missile from a submarine and incinerate a US target in Hawaii with megatons or perhaps kilotons of nuclear explosives because this act would convince the US to retaliate and nuke . . . China? Ah. . . how devious of those Russkis. But my gut feeling is that SAC would have went after Moscow and Beijing a tad later. I don't think the Russkis were this stupid. Recommend someone consider Plan B. The Golf Class subs were junk. Someone or something on board this particular Golf-class sub failed; and a lot of sailors died horrible deaths under the sea. But in any event, if a sequel is planned, the KURSK disaster would make a great plot device."
4,Cute book,"I am giving this to my dad for X-mas and I think he will really like it. It is a very cute way to say the loving things that are sometimes hard to put into words. The pictures and story go very well together, and the book flows well. After reading it, I felt satisfied that my dad will enjoy this book as a gift."
4,Great book,"I really like your illustrations and the big font. It is user friendly, flows well and a great learning tool."
2,What product?,"Amazon sent me an email asking me to write a review of this product. Usually I like to have actually used the product before writing a review, but since I haven't received it yet, that is not possible. It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com. Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now. I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user. I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon. I hear DV cable does it's job, but I'll have to wait and see."
1,Self-satisfied drivel,"Unfortunately, Joel Engel's biography of Rod Serling is so poorly written that it detracts from the story of Serling's life. It appears that the author was so satisfied with his own reasearch, so enamoured of his discoveries about Mr. Serling, that a grammar check on the manuscript was forgotten. It is painful to read a book so haphazard in its language, especially since it is a book about a man who was so eloquent and prolific in his own lifetime. The author spends many pages on unnecessary tangents, such as the strategic importance of the Philippines, for example. While this may have been an attempt to set the scene for Serling's entrance into our larger history, such details makes one wonder if Mr. Engel really didn't have sufficient material on his subject. Sadly, I cannot recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,"This was the first book by this author that I had started to read. Perhaps, that was my first mistake. I truly did not like this book -- the characters, the plot, the overall language in the book -- all disgusted me. I could not bring myself to finish the book. If the rest of this author's books, are anything like this one, I think I will be avoiding this author's work."
2,Very Upsetting!!,"Other reviewers have written that you have to read this book as a stand alone in order to enjoy it. I definately agree. Maybe if I had not read anything by this author before I would have enjoyed this book. On the other hand it is entirely possible that I would not have read her other books thinking them to be like this one - and that would have been a major mistake. Having read her previous books (the trilogy which she wrote first yet which take place in the distant future as far as this book is concerned) I was expecting a lot more. Yes, true this is only one book and not a series, but that still can not excuse the flatness of the characters and the plot. I was looking forward to reading this book on the premise that the auther would maintain her standard of writing and to my dismay I was let down. I will probably try to read any new book she may write in the hopes that it will be as good as her first three books, but I won't be buying them."
2,Disappointing,"The book is based in the same world and time as that of the previous books of The Black Jewels Trilogy. This is a independent 4th in the series. Unfortunately the author has been there and done that. The plot is therefor predictable and the settings and character development are both sad shadows of the original trilogy, which had both a strong storyline and unexpected twists and turns. If you are looking for something with the originality, strength, and emotion of the previous books adjust your expectations. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a light ""re-run"" of the universe of the black jewels. Hey Ms. Bishop! Please write another one about something we haven't seen... perhaps the non-human blood? This one is more ho-hum, you could easily put it down."
3,black jewel,This book was in typical fashion of the author. I enjoy her books and this was a quick read. I kept asking myself when was this guy going to figure out what I knew 3 chapters ago. For it's predictabitlity it was still enjoyable.
4,"good, but not up to jewels standards","Yes, The Invisible Ring was enjoyable, but it was definately lacking something. The Black Jewels Trilogy had passion and icy hatred mixed with dark obsessions and unwavering loyalty, but this strange prequelish continuation? Almost every character in this book seems like a washed up reflection of someone else in the amazing novels it's based off of. Jared seemed like he was meant to be somewhat of a mix between Daemon and Lucivar, but it just didn't work for me. He just didn't have enough... personality to carry the male end of the story.Still, I am in love with the world that Bishop has created. I forgive the book for the majority of it's rough ends. Any story even remotely related her rich, detailed world is definately worth my time. I'm waiting for more..."
4,Revlon,I need more Age Defying Skin Smoothing Poweder 09 Medium Beige/Golden BeigeThank youJudie Kimmel
1,Threads need work,"I bought this because I wanted a higher-quality connection than the plastic hose ends found in the local home store. However, the threads on the male end are not machined, they are just pressed/stamped. The result is that they leak, no matter how carefully tightened or what kind of gasket/o-ring I use.Not recommended."
5,Vintage childrens books,"I bought 3 vintage childrens books from Amazon. And, all three were in great condition. For being as old as they are, I am really amaized that they look almost like new. Whoever had the books took really good care of them."
4,Classic Book for Baby,This Golden Book will bring back memories and give new ones for your little one. I think the story has a great message and needs to be taught to those little children as they are growing.
4,Classic,"One of my favorite albums by Kreator. Great old school thrash metal. Can't go wrong. I don't have my vinyl with me anymore, so I had to buy the mp3's..."
5,Good Metal,Great old cassette still plays very well. For being over 20 years and Will play it till it falls apart. METAL UP>>>>>
5,Great Handheld very durable,I took this product to Iraq with me it got me out of a jam a time or two. It took a beating and still works perfectly. It even floats you just can't beat it.
4,"Show Business, Shashi Tharoor","the friends I have that are keen on India and its culture recommended me this book of Shashi Tharoor long ago. Last year I was involved with a mooovie shooting for a Chennai production in Spain. Reading the novel I have not only enjoyed every line of it but lived again last year experience. He does not exagerate a single bit the characters, events and astonishing facts represented in the book. And he does it with such a humour, sometimes hilarating, criticism but not offensive, like a mother would criticise her sons, that makes you live the adventures of Ashok Banjara and wish they never finish. Highly recommended"
5,A Cabaret Fortune Teller Haunts Me....,"Once again Audra developes 10 mind blowing tracks that invoke thoughs and images from within the listeners soul and brings them down a path firmilar to all. Loss of innocence and personal evolution. The songs seem to have a harder edge but, keep the same passion as the Premier album. It leaves you wanting more. One of my favorite albums of all time. Going to the Theatre will always have something new to please you anytime you listen. The final song ""Don't End This Time"" (one of my personal favorites), desire to hear more. Personal favorites on this album: (once again all but here are my highlights) ""In A Dark Room"", ""Fearless Peaches"",""Cabaret Fortune Teller"" (Very Haunting a must hear). Audra's Going to the Theatre is a must have!!!! *****"
5,excellent sampler of chai,this is quality tea both decaf and regular. i like all flavors in this box.
5,Iditarod Dream,"Boys will love this book about a young man racing in the Iditarod Junior Race. I liked it too. The book details the winning boy in the race from practicing for the race, leaving his home the day of the race and the experience of racing. It is very facinating and well written."
5,Truly Ready-to-Use!,"As a middle school writing teacher, it is always my goal to optimize the effectiveness of writing workshop. Most ""ready-to-use"" teacher resources that are suitable for mini-lessons fall short of my expectations, so I tend to create my own. Every page of this book is useful! The handouts may be used in any order and cover a wide range of literary devices, grammar rules and writing skills. Students read and respond to high-interest passages to develop as readers and writers. I highly recommend this resource!"
3,"Products okay, but late, late delivery, sad, but true","Several products were ordered from Wisconsin Cheeseman on Dec. 11. Perhaps the mail/ups/etc. was the problem. However, I made several orders from many companies and this was the only order with the hitches and snags. The Christmas order included Christmas Foods. They arrived late and are still around the house. It was too bad, the families had left and there is nothing worse than the post Christmas leftovers.lol The petits fours, in actuality, weren't that great anyway.. It may be the nature of Petits Fours these days, or it may be that they were just too commercial, rather waxy on the outside and cloyingly sweet on the inside. I think the recipe could use improvement. The fruit cake was good and the candies were lovely."
1,Oh please make it stop,"This is just bad. I certainly would not recommend this cd to anyone. First of all, the vocals are unbelievably bad. If you're able to get past the singing (a term I use loosely here), dealing with the bassist is almost equally undesirable. Less is more sometimes. However, the overly self-indulgent bass player for BA obviously doesn't see it that way. His over-the-top playing actually takes away from the songs, and the listener is force-fed a heavy dose of his noodling that's far too prominent in the mix. The guitars leave nothing to write home about, they're just rather boring. I get the feeling that this is the bass player's band and these are his hired incompetent lackeys. This 6 song cd (which includes a cover song I won't get into) is a laughable attempt at the ""NU-METAL"" genre. It makes a nifty Frisbee, though."
2,Okay but nothing to write home about,"I am a born and bred Texan who also went to Texas A&M. You can't turn around without hearing some kind of saying.I thought the book was cute but missing some vital sayings that most Texans say everyday. Like to say Hello is Howdy, y'all. Also under nervous it didn't say ""As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs"".Overall I thought the book was pretty lacking. My fiancé and I bought the book for his British relatives."
4,More than you can shake a stick at,I happened across this little book at a used book sale.I'm from New England and couldn't get over how similar a lot of the Texas sayings were to the old time sayings in my home state of Vermont... except of course for the ones pertaining to ranching.It was very enjoyable and I did read quite a few new ones.
5,Has everything you've ever wondered about....,"I have lots of jewelry books. This is more of ""class examples"" and the like. It shows many ways to do textures, finishes, etc. and shows the finished product. It has saved me the time and expense of doing them myself. What a help!"
2,"Cute pictures, terrible gauge problems","I have tried two patterns from the book, and sampled several more. Both sweaters have turned out much too wide and large, even with smaller yarn and needles than she recommends. I'm an experienced knitter, although I depend on patterns and don't make many changes. Even the swatches I have tried have turned out about a third again as large as they should be.Has anybody else had this problem?"
5,"Gorgeous illustrations, a cherished volume","I have still, in my collection, the copy of this book that my mother gave me when I was a child in the late 60's. The illustrations are some of the loveliest I have ever seen and I am so glad that I was able to keep hold of this book despite my many relocations. Cinderella, Babes in the Wood, Sleeping Beauty, Puss in Boots, Tom Thumb, Hansel and Gretel, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast are evocatively illustrated with lush, imaginative touches - pictures that I could never forget even forty years after I first saw them."
4,"Loves me, Love me not",Amazon.com has not been disappointing.....The only gripe is you've gotten a little slower...I will order from Amazon.com....I have enjoyed everything I have ordered....My wife is the main person who orders and absolutely love Amazon.....Doris and Arsenio
3,Need more detail on the product,"Moog sells these in pairs and Amazon.com doesn't mention that these are sold in pairs. I am awaiting my order and hope I am not surprised by only getting one coil spring. I could buy the Moog cc865 from someone else that lists them as pairs but, the shipping cost added about $10 more than I paid here. I will post another review when the pair of coil springs arrive, that is what I believe I am getting due to what the picture shows and what other websites state about the same product."
1,Something for the fans,"If you are familiar with the cast, it's a chance to see them in action, and you'll appreciate the choreography. There's a lot of talent there, but keep in mind that it's not a mainstream, high budget movie, so don't expect a blockbuster."
5,Compelling,"The words compelling, thrilling, suspenseful, wonderful - are words that can apply to all of Jo Bannister's books. I think she is a wonderful author who draws you in by your heart strings and does not let you go until the last page has been read. Bannister is very accomplished at holding your interest with her words of description and guiding you thru the ranges of all the emotions. She is an author who gives her characters depth, frailty, strengths, faults - in other words the characters become very real to the reader and that is something that not many authors can do consistently. Jo Bannister is an author that shouldn't be passed by."
5,A Healing Book for Anyone with Food & Body Issues,"The author uses storytelling a a compassionate vehicle to describe how women become trapped in dyfunctional relationships with food, mind and body (regardless of the culture they live in). This approach is not only intriguing and insightful, it is a nonthreatening way to help crack the veneer of denial that goes hand-in-hand with eating disorders and unhealthy relationships with food."
1,No Shoes!,"I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes, only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered. I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out. I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive. But, no shoes. Finally, after repeated email inquiriea, I received a blunt response saying essentially, ""We TOLD you we don't have the Chestnut colored shoes"". I will not order from this company again as it appears they don't have good internal communication."
1,Awful quality.,"This is a wonderful book that includes ""pocket"" pages with letters from fairytale characters. There were ripped pages, and most of the letters that were supposed to be in the pocket pages were missing. I am incensed that I purchased an incomplete product that was in terrible condition."
4,"Good, not Great Neil Young","Several of the reviewers who trashed this CD missed the point. Neil Young was trying for a different sound and did so on some of the tracks. For the reader considering buying the CD, it is well worth the price of admission. This is still the Neil Young sound with the electric sound instead of the acoustic sound. The most accurate description is that of a mellow electric sound. There are some great songs which are consistent with his earlier work including; ""Mr. Dissapointment"", ""Goin Home"", ""Two Old Friends"" and ""She's A Healer"". I give it 4 out of 5 because it is a good, enjoyable listening CD."
4,see silver and gold,"John mayel, jack johnson and a host of other ""singer song writers with their acoustic guitars DMB included"" don't even hold a candle to our rusty horse Mr. Young. he doesn't just write songs, he tears life into tiny pieces, then puts words to the memories"
3,It doesn't ...,"I agree with the other reviewers that this album is a little sleepy. I would also add that its a bit dreary, like he wrote much of it on a cloudy, rainy day. Not much energy here.Neil Young fans will like it, but the occasional listener won't get it."
2,"Alternate title: ""Are You Still Awake?""","There are reasons why this album never made it to the top echelon of Neil Young albums. He didn't exactly come roaring out of the gates into the 21st Century.It's turgid, it's sluggish, it's...oh, I don't know, get out your thesaurus and come up with your own descriptor.Even a song like ""Goin' Home""...which echoes prime Neil & Crazy Horse...isn't as good as prime Neil & Crazy Horse. It makes you want to put on ""Zuma"" or ""Ragged Glory.""The post-9/11 song ""Let's Roll"" is a sign of the times. ""Are You Passionate"" was released on April 9, 2002, almost 7 months after everything changed. It's definitely no ""Ohio,"" but it's Neil's take on the events of 9/11.Backing is from Booker T. Jones (organ, vibes, vocal), Duck Dunn (bass), Steve Potts (drums), Frank Sampedro (guitar and vocal), Tom Bray (trumpet), Neil's wife Pegi (vocals), and his sister Astrid (vocals)."
1,"Listened to this once, then sold it.","A Neil Young album should not be this boring. At last check, there were 63 copies available from Amazon sellers, starting at $1.45."
2,When you see me fly away without you.....,"Yes. It's over. I've been having my doubts for awhile. Now, I've made my decision. After more than 30 years, Neil and I are going our seperate ways. I'd rather live with happy memories than trying to save a relationship that obviously has no future. Maybe, one day, we'll meet again."
5,Works great!,This is exactly what I needed! It works like a charm and arrived earlier than I expected too! Great Product!
1,Such poor quality it doesnt even have a name on it.,"I ordered this piece pretty cheap off of here, it was pretty inexpensive I cant remember for sure but I want to say it was under $7 with shipping. It did arrive in decent time, how ever when I got it- Immediately noted that it didn't have a name ore any kind of branding on it, It was slightly miss-shaped and not symmetrical. With my heart already sinking, I connected it to my laptop and then to my external monitor. (Both of which (port and monitor) work perfectly). Upon turning on the monitor how ever, I could see my background, but before I could even be happy the screen on my external monitor started jumping and flickering, and doing so with such frequency that nothing was readable. However when I plugged my T.V. into the same port (getting rid of the adapter) I never have any problems. THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK!!!!! I DIDN'T SPEND MUCH ON IT BUT STILL FEEL THAT WAS MONEY THOROUGHLY WASTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Time line history of Randall Knives and the Randall Family,"This is a nice history of Randall Made Knives. The book gives a time line history of the Randall knife production and an historical perspective. The various models and the history of how they came into being is presented. The story of the development of these knives is excellent and a lot of details are included. A nice set of photographs of the different models and configurations is included along with excellent photographs throughout the book. What is missing is a discription of the knife making process, an explanation of the different sheaths and the meanings of the different markings. There is no discription of the changes in the knives over the years that would help in establishing dates of manufacture, etc. A very informative and enjoyable book for any knife collector. A must for anyone interested in Randall Made Knives."
5,Great video!,"I love this video because you get good, deep stretches as well as cardio in one workout. If you have never done yoga, the instructions are clear enough for you to follow and one of the instructors does modified versions of each exercise. If you have done lots of yoga, you will still get a good workout."
3,Didn't meet expectations!,"After using the same beginner yoga dvd for several months, I was seeking one offering more poses, extended stretching opportunites and a greater yoga experience. Because of the reasonable price, I decided to give this dvd a try, in spite of some viewer warnings. I really wanted to like this dvd but was too bored to continue past the first twenty minutes! Despite her cheery disposition, I found the instructor's style somewhat disruptive and lacking in opportunites to hold poses long enough to achieve any real benefit. Instructions seemed to be thrown out between breaths. ""Breath in...raise your arms overhead....breathe out.....lower them to the floor....... stretch back into plank.......feel the burn, we're burning calories. If you are looking for a non-impact aerobic workout you may want to give this dvd a try. If you are searching for real yoga instruction you may want to keep looking."
1,"Blah, blah, blah....","I was really disappointed with this book - I purchased it with the notion in my head that I would be receiving something enjoyable, relaxing, perhaps even inspirational. I received none of the aforementioned. Dull - perhaps a better word. At times, goofy and just plain boring. This book is a real dud."
5,One of the best prequels to a space odyssey that I have read,"This is one of the best prequels to a space odyssey that I have read. F.M. Busby's characters are vividly drawn, and you leave the book wanting more from these characters. It was easy to get drawn into their lives, to root for the good guys and hate the bad guys. I'm glad that I have the first one, and I am determined to get all the rest. If you love a good sci-fi romp with great characters involved in vivid imagery, I suggest you do what ever you can to get your hands on these books."
4,Close look at a 20th Century master,"This is a well-documented and nicely illustrated book on the life and work of Albert Marquet, the early 20th Century colorist painter who was the friend and colleague of most of the painting greats of the time, but who stuck tenaciously to an unchanging style that was pretty much his own. The pages of this work are a good size and the painting insets are especially useful in understanding Marquet's unique brushwork and spatial observations. There is good biographic information about the painter here, but the emphasis is on his work, with some particular focus on his paintings held in Russian collections. An excellent reference work for anyone interested in art of the past century."
2,I own this and have heard the vocals (not on samples),"I think that the instrumental half of the music is beautiful, but the vocals aren't very impressive. Great musicians, bad singers. What I mean by bad singers is that you can tell the vibrato is forced. They must know the boundaries of their talent, because the free samples fail to let you hear the vocals."
2,it was aight,"i expected this movie to be a bit better&it had some moments. it was about a Preacher helping people out dealing with all kinds of situations. the movie lasts a bit too long,but there are some funny moments that bring it back,but it's just aight in the end. this film is like a Low Budget Tyler Perry film in alot of ways,but it's aight."
2,Wish mine worked,"I was so excited when I found this deal. This TV was exactly what I was looking for. I received it yesterday and it worked halfway through its first movie and hasn't worked right since. It's like it freezes or something. The picture stops and then slowly goes grey. When this happens I can't even access the menu or adjust the volume. I have to just shut it off. If I let it ""rest"" for a few hours it will work for a few minutes and then go gray again.I have to assume that my TV is a lemon, and if it worked I would give this item a much higher rating. I was very happy with the picture (while it was working), and the set itself looks slick."
3,"It's Steve Young, but not what you think","Australian Tour EP 2007Review by Michael J. O'NeillThe title is a misnomer because two of the tracks (#1 & #4) were from a live performance in Youngstown, OH (2006) and the remaining four songs were three previously released albums of his. While the music is great (especially the first track, ""Coyote,"" the EP is deceptively titled because the buyer is not getting what is expected--there is no music from the Australian tour (which headlined Mary Gauthier). Steve owes his fans an apology and an actual recording of the 2007 Australia tour. Fans should also protest by not purchasing this EP."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought it in May 2002 and now it starts to give me problem. So I called the service center and I was put off for numerous times. The technician is absolutely lack of knowledge and does not offer any help except keep on asking you to reinstall the system or upgrade compter etc. etc. Also they ask you to use ONLY SONY CDRs which I think is junk. SONY is doing everything to let the warranty expire! Still keep on fighting to get it repaired before my warranty expires.Also do not buy a SONY HDTV! One trainer from a Statistics Software company told me that Customer Report rated SONY's product so bad that SONY were seeking help from their company to sue CR. Of course SONY faliled because the data, no matter how they manipulate it, suggests SONY is bad. Think twice if you want to buy SONY!!!"
1,deceptive manufacturer,"Don't buy from this deceptive manufacturer, their service is the worst I have ever had!I got the same model half year ago, and it is not working anymore! Their products will just last for a little longer than the warranty period.And, the wosre thing is their customer service. I called for help and they didn't try to answer you any question or ask you the details, but ask you to pay 19.99 for even answering some simple questions! In addition, they told me this is what their service should be. DON'T BUY from SONY AGAIN!!WORST EXPERIENCE ever!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these to use on an older Schwinn bike I was fixing up. The stopping power wasn't very impressive, and they seemed to wear down quickly. I ended up getting a nicer set of brakes for the rear wheel, and kept these on the front (at least for now). In the end, they worked, but I wouldn't trust them in a situation where you truly needed them."
4,"Lovely Illustrations, Serene Atmosphere","A Japanese man travels across the Pacific to reach the shores of the United States in this Caldecott awarded book. The story is told from his grandson's perspective in simple prose befitting an easy book. But the story is deceptively deep. This is no ordinary journey, but a courageous search for a new life in a new world. Character strengths like perseverance and faithful outlook are easily discerned in the grandfather as he builds a family and a worthy life in the U.S. But Japan is never far from his mind, and he daydreams about his former life in his homeland. It is a positive tale good not only for Asian Americans, but for anyone seeking inspiration."
3,California or Japan,"I like this book because it has very interesting pictures. The characters are the grandfather, his wife, their daughter, her husband, and their son. They're all important to the grandfather.The setting was interesting because the grandfather moved a lot. He was in Japan. Then went to America and moved to California and back to Japan to get his wife.He always wants to be in another place at the same time. The grandfather wanted to go back to Japan but the war started."
1,For deaf people only,"This DVD from Digital Works has no sound whatsoever. Nor does it have title cards as silent movies did. So all you can is watch, not listen. And the picture is very blurry, no better than any other distributor of these old public domain films.I was hoping for an improvement on my Madacy DVD of Lucky Texan, but this sure isn't it."
1,AWFULLY HORRIBLE!,"I wish I could return this book if I had not spilt coffee over it... When I ordered the books, I also chose this book, which was such a big mistake. Redundant language, no particular tips to use. As a US reader, unfortunately, I must agree with an Australian reader. The other book I ordered was much much much better. The other book's title was ""Using QuickBooks with Proper Accounting""."
1,Terrible,"I returned this book after 2 days, it was badly written and hard to follow. It is not that good for dummies!"
4,SKIM this book if you're not going to read other things,"I didn't read enough. My wife read a ton of the books. But I did enjoy skimming parts of this book which I found to be the right balance of humor and good info... favorite section was ""what she says / what she means / what not to say as a husband / what you SHOULD say..."""
1,I know it's trying to be funny but I found it insulting,"I thought that a book that had a humorous approach to navigating the unchartered waters of parenthood for a first time Dad would be fun and informative. I found the ""caveman"" stereotyping got old really quickly and soon became insulting. I would not recommend it to other men."
1,DUMB!! DUMB!!,"It's horrible... I can't believe that it received good reviews. I think the best book is ""BE PREPARED, A practical handbook for new dads."" Now THAT book is awesome. I read it and I learned something. From THIS book - Caveman's Pregnancy Companion... I learned that the writer is an idiot who doesn't understand anything... He was offensive, and just HORRIBLE.. I am sooo thankful that I didn't BUY the book.. I got it at the library. So... Nope... don't buy it.. if your curious.. go to the library.XOXO"
2,Confusing with silly caveman jargon,"My husband received this book as a gift, flipped through it and put it down asking me to read it and summarise the contents when I got a chance. While the essence of the book is sound, there is too much gimmicky ""caveman/ cro magnum"" jargon to sift through. It's quite off-putting for the average intelligent man to adopt the guise of a caveman in learning about what he and his partner should expect during pregnancy and childbirth. I'd leave this book alone in favour of ""The Expectant Father"" or for something conscise and humourous, try ""My Guys Can Swim"""
4,Author has a real feel for real characters!,"Because of the subject matter and the fact that this is happening everyday, I hate to say I loved this book, but I did! Reading this book from a mother's view, a father's, or even a child's is so touching. It is definetly worth your time. You will be tempted to read it straight through and then give it immediately to a friend."
4,Helpful Hint,"The Maclaren Buggy Bag has served us well. When traveling internationally, some airlines allow a carry-on and one checked bag for baby as well as a collapsible stroller even if the infant/toddler is a lap child. To reduce pieces of luggage I skipped the extra baby baggage because I was using the space in the sturdy and roomy Buggy Bag. However, at airline check-in I was disappointed to learn that I had to remove the extra diapers and light jackets I had packed with the stroller. That was frustrating news but overall the Buggy Bag has protected our Maclaren Triumph nicely when checking the bag with the included quality luggage tag and when the stroller is in storage in a closet.Note: Make a request for a FRAGILE tag or stickers at check-in to help ensure a TOP LOAD because the bag does not have a frame."
3,GOOD BASIC DATA,"I teach a class in U.S. Citizenship preparation. I found the book to be helpful in providing some basic data for the INS interview process. The book is meant for people with limited English skills, with more focus on the Spanish speaker. As such, it provides helpful information even in vocabulary skills such as might not be provided in a typical ESL class. I have found that many of my students, for instance, have never encountered the word ""oath"" before. This book provides an easy to understand definition of this word, along with the inclusion of a mini dictionary of other much needed vocabulary words in both English and Spanish in preparation for INS testing. I recommend the book, and most especially to the Hispanic person looking for study material for the U.S. citizenship test."
5,True ? Don't know but the tips could change your life!,"I picked up this book just out of curiosity. Well, I don't know whether it is true or false but the analogy explained here is very logical and consistent with our over all perception of reality.I am writing review not because the description of afterlife fascinated me but for the concluding chapters where Susan gave us some tips about how to live our present lives here. I think if you read only that much and practice some of them; your life will change.Don't know what happen after we die but as long as we are living here (we have no choice but to continue like that till that call comes!) we can best use it.SUhas Gokhale"
2,"eh, whatever...","it's pretty, but useless if you already own a more comprehensive guide to aromatherapy like The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy, which will provide you with all the same information and then some.Still, if you're going to buy a gift for someone with this topic, this is a nice one to give. It's definitely prettier than the Complete Book..."
5,Th work saver!,"My do is a German Shepard/Doberman mix. Short hair, but sheds, sheds,sheds! This product helps with that and keeps her skin from drying out so bad. The last time I ran out she would not eat as well, she really likes the flavor."
1,such bullcrap,"This was expensive, messy, and did absolutely nothing for my dogs' fur. It's basically a $20 bottle of vegetable oil."
3,Didn't do much,"The dogs love the taste. I bought every kind of VitaSavory Tasty sauce they make for dogs and they hated it,I buy this to stop the shedding and they think it tastes great. It is bright yellow and stains pretty bad so I have to be careful not to spill when pouring. I have not seen that they have slowed down on the shedding. Oh well I guess the dog hair tumbleweeds are here to stay, at least it wasn't a total waste."
2,Off the Radar Beam,"My VHS transfer of Radar Men From The Moon, which is twenty years old, puts this DVD version to shame. This low resolution print is noisy and washed out. Commando Cody's next adventure should be to find and destroy all the existing Whirlwind DVDs."
2,Radar Men From the Moon (DVD),"Radar Men From the Moon is one of those Republic Serials that you either love or hate. It was one of their later serials, borrowng heavily from footage of Republic's glory days. Regardless, this serial is fun to watch in any format. This DVD edition has a fine picture transfer, especially since it did not come from Republics original master. My only problem with this Roan release is that I purchsed it more than twice. Each time I purchased it I got the first 6 chapters on both sides. Until they fix their production problems I can't reccomend this edition."
2,Off The Scope,"There are good, fair, merely okay, and down-right bad serials. This one falls somewhere between the okay and down-right bad. Don't wait to find out why they are called ""Radar Men;"" there's no radar in sight-- which is, by and large, rather typical of this particular serial."
4,Best of the popular AT DVDs,"I ordered most of the popular AT Trail DVD documentaries, and this is my favorite. It is well filmed and provides an excellent overview of the trail from beginning to end. It is clear that a lot of effort went into making this DVD, and that the film-makers wanted to provide an informational DVD rather than a ""personality driven"" DVD. This is hands-down the best choice for anyone who wants a well-done overview about hiking the AT. Also, easily the best choice for teachers who want to show their students a film about the AT."
5,jack johnson is amazing,"this cd is phenomenal. it's great for kids, it's great for jack fans. i love him even more then i did before!!!"
3,Simple Sing Along,"Theme song, UPSIDE DOWN, is a catchy and simple toe tapping sing along, but the rest of the cd sounds much like this theme song....same rhythm, same sound. However, be certain that kids will enjoy it, and it fits the movie perfectly. The included lyric booklet makes it all the more fun."
5,Even I enjoy listening to it everyday,It is a great cd for children and adults. I listen to to it every day with my 8 month old and she sways to the music of the first song all ways. I have also bought it for friends with kids and every one can't believe it is a children cd because it is so good.
5,The perfect CD for kids and parents,I just couldnt get this music out of my head after I saw the show! And to have the CD at my fingertips is wonderful. It brings a happy atmosphere to my home whenever it is on. Thank you Jack....what a wonderful assortment of songs. I know it is good when I later hear my kids humming the tune. We cant get enough of it.
5,I love this soundtrack,"This is an excellent soundtrack to the new animated movie Curious George. My favorite track is the first single Upside Down. This is a song about we should always have a curious approach about life and make our own discoveries.Jungle Gym is another catchy tune here. This is a very playful song that fits the spirit of the movie well. This is a song that is easy to sing along to especially when Johnson sings the la la chorus of this song. I love the duet with my own two hands with Ben Harper here. It is a pretty song about reaching out to make a friend.The 3 R's is another highlight here. This is a cute song about how everything we find is useful, and that we should not waste anything. I think the track The Sharing Stone is a very groovy sounding song. I enjoyed the piano playing by Zach Gill on this track, and I think he compliments Jack Johnson's vocals here well. Jack Johnson is truly a talented musician. I love this soundtrack, and I can't wait to see the movie."
4,"Because it's Jack Johnson, I'll buy it","Maybe not the best choice this time around. This is good, but not great. 3 and a half stars. I thought Jack could do no wrong. I completely enjoy the earlier three CDs, but this one just isn't as good. Even my young kids prefer the other JJ CDs to this one."
4,Great for kids and adults,My little guy loves these songs...and they aren't annoying to adults! I get so sick of our other kid CDs so this one is really a win-win situation. Enjoy!
5,What a lovely Soundtrack,Surprise that's a softly soundtrack. Cute design of the cover.Jack Johnson's voice is good.Recommend this CD.
1,curious george for kids,"I bought the cd because my kids love the movie and some of the songs just make you happy. Well there is only one song on the cd that is worth listening to. I would not recommend this cd for kids, you would be better off getting the single."
1,boring,"Trite and boring. This probably would have been a mediocre album had there not been an attempt to cover a song by the White Stripes. Consequent this attempt, and Jack Johnsons miserable failure, I'd have to say this is a downright bad album. Jack Johnson sounds mechanical and as a man who lacks a soul. Over-produced and over-reaching, I try to find at least one thing redeeming in something, but in this album, I cannot."
4,Handy Book for moving,I moved from San Diego to Seattle with very little knowledge about Seattle. This book was a great reference and I felt like I knew enough from this book that I could make the move fairly smoothly (which I did).
2,Not that helpful,I was excited when I got this book but after reading many books on dog trainning and behavior I found this book to be not so helpful or to the point. I was having many problems teaching my dog how to walk on a leash and stop mouthing everyone in the family and this book barley addressed these issues and didn't say how to handle them at all. all it did was explain what mouthing was and why puppies do it. Yeah well that didn't help me. Save your money for a shorter book that will work!
3,Not Playtime.,"For people expecting 'Play' Pt 2, don't even bother. It's definitely not like it's predecessor, in fact it's a departure from the last one. Gone are the sultry undertones of 'Porcelain' but the return of electronic flavor in 'We Are All Made Of Stars'. His collaboration with Sinead O'Connor on 'Harbour' leaves an unwanted slightly formulaic aftertaste to it. Even 'Jam For The Ladies' disappoints. The only song that seemed to warm was 'At Least We Tried'. Minimalism echos in the entire album. Lacks the oomph of 'Play'. The somberness of the disc can sometimes be mistaken more as constipated. The music is as light as the weight of the CD itself."
2,"Mellow Moby's ""18""","This is definitely Moby's most mellow, chill-out dance release yet. I bought the album because I wanted to hear other songs that sound similiar to the catchy, cool pop sound of ""We are made of stars.""Strangely, there were not any other Moby songs on the album that resemble it. The mood and style of Moby's 18 is urban jazzy, slow tempo. The album's mood is basically for the listener to either relax, meditate, or fall to sleep to. Just be prepared that if you decide on adding 18 to your collection, there isnt a part of this album that has any uptempo dance beats like Moby's last album ""Play"" contains. My album summary: Overall, Moby does'nt seem to create any inventive sounds, but it's competent music when anyone's in a laid-back mood."
3,C+,"As others have noted, 18 sounds like some leftover b-sides from PLAY. I have only listened this album twice now, but I don't think I will be bothering to listen again. These songs lack the originality and sonic depth of PLAY."
4,A fan...,"Well this cd is great, however if you are looking for a cd similer to play. This is not for you. Moby had decided to do more electic experimental music on this album. It is not bad, and the more I listen to it the better I think it is, just keep in mind that it is not the Moby we used to know for Play."
4,It grows on you,"I bought '18' while on bit of a 'Play' high, so at first, it struck me how un-'Play'-ful it was. It left a rather ambiguous taste in my mouth, but as I listened to it more, I found myself growing attached to it in a completely different way than I was to 'Play'. Now granted, I did like 'Play' more (or, more specifically, liked more songs on 'Play'), but that doesn't keep '18' from having some real charmers. ""Extreme Ways"" and ""In My Heart"" have a hidden energy that is more felt than heard, ""Signs Of Love"" and especially ""18"" (my personal favorite) are borderline ethereal, and ""Great Escape"" is a simple song with simple harmonies. Basically, '18' is one to listen to when you're feeling a 'lil down, with songs that kind of just stand next to you, pat you on the back and say ""I'm here for you, man""."
2,"No, it's definitely not 'Play 2'...","I loved 'PLAY', I thought it was a genius record. 18 is a lot less involving to me, more personal for Moby I'd assume, more lonely, much more sad with an echoing wail. He sounded like someone very disappointed on their deathbed on 'Play', now he sounds like he's ready to die. Everyone notices the 09/11/01 aspect, apparently 3000 dead really put a damper on Moby's birthday party. It's not really a tribute to anyone, but a strange, detached commentary of how social/political issues hurt Moby. Kind of like a lighter, softer Korn, with dead female singers. If you want to know what the odd track is in this disc, it's easily 'Jam for the Ladies' where Moby raps with a lisp. In my opinion, a bizarre misfire, but artful nonetheless."
2,Next CD Please....,"An Insipid and bland collection of songs. Relentlessly mediocre and completely forgettable. Tedious and hard to listen to all the way through. With all the good music out there, you can safely skip this one. ""We are all made of Stars"" will probably appear on a compilation next year."
2,Uninspired,"Up to this point, inspiration and creative energy have hallmarked Moby's efforts, making every listen a new and renewing experience. '18' falls very short of the standard Moby has set for himself in his previous work. The first track is a corny radio edit that fails to sustain interest for any significant period of time. The rest of the album appears to be B-side and editing room floor material from 'Play.' What is most disappointing about this effort is the apparent and utter lack of emotional commitment in the music. Sustaining the intensity typical of previous releases must no doubt be difficult, but I'd rather have gone without a new album for awhile than suffer the immense disappointment I have with this half-hearted (if that) attempt."
4,"Yes, it's a rehash, I don't care, much...","Yes, I love Moby. I loved Moby, Everything is Wrong, Animal Rights, Ambient and Play. This album is just Play all over again, but that's not really a bad thing in my opinion.I enjoyed this album from start to finish, especially 'We Are All Made of Stars', 'In This World', 'Fireworks', and the Bodyrock-ing 'Jam for the Ladies'.In short, if you liked Play, you should buy this album."
3,"Good at points, but not upbeat","I liked Play because it was an upbeat album with many happy songs in it. Even though the lyrics in Play were often grim, the melodies that accompanied them were usually inspiring. 18 sounds depressing at most points. It clearly has lots of influence from Moby's earlier album Ambient. The songs in this album are not pop-radio hits that DJs will play over and over again, with the exception of Jam For The Ladies and possibly one or two others."
4,More of Same - Not a Bad Thing,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard it all about Moby - marketing genious, musical Mozart, but is the album any good? It's great, if you don't expect anything radically different from his other album Play. The gospel women are here again, crying out, and Moby's in the background, meshing chords and electronic riffs to go with their voices. Tracks like ""In This World"" set the tone of the album right off. Moby was in a tough spot - if he had made this album too different, then we'd be complaining about how we don't recognize it. He has evolved, like Radiohead between their Kid A and Amnesiac albuums, in a steady and clear climb to the summit of his own brand (!) of music. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
5,Even better than Play,"Moby has done it again. The sound is similar to Play, but the female vocalists on several of the songs distinguish this CD. What a great, upbeat listen, especially on the Gospel-like tunes In this World and Rafters."
5,Cutting edge arrangement and songwriting. Highly succesful!,Another flow of light moods that caryy a hip and fun vibe. Great party background music. An album that grows on you over time into another classic. Top notch production and arrangement that take you someplace new which is the music's draw and Moby's strength. Moby is original. Different yet similar to Play. Add it to your collection and you will be succesful...
2,I expected better,"After the sucess of his album Play, Moby followed that pattern in his new album 18. However, his songs started to go in the wrong direction. What set Moby apart originally was his techno/electronica dance beats that reverberated around a room. Sadly, his music has gotten away from his initial sound, and though he has found greater sucess, it's not what I had come to like so much about Moby. His 1996 album ""Everything is Wrong"" is in my opinion his best album. It contained all of the innovative, catchy beats that his music is now lacking. If you'd like to hear what a slightly more techno version of the Killers would sound like, pick up this album. If you're not, or if you're looking for classic Moby, you'll be disappointed. I expected better."
3,weakest moby album yet,"as a long time moby fan, i would have to say this is his weakest cd to date. save your money."
5,Body Rocking jams for the ladies,"Well, well...well. Senor Moby has done it again. After being blessed with the meaty ""Play"" album, I was eager for another feeding. ""18"" more than lives up to my expectations, it surpasses them. ""Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)"" is especially heart felt since Moby's birthday is on Sept. 11th--it's very eerie song to say the least. Other tracks that standout are ""Another Woman"" (just love the vocal sample), ""Jam for the Ladies"" (it's nice to hear MC Lyte on this track), ""Sleep Alone"" (thank you Moby), and ""Harbour"" (Sinead just kills this track). Moby is a great artist with a gift for putting human emotion into music."
5,"A ""collection of songs"" for the times","Take Moby's own advice from the liner notes. Sit and listen to this record front to back. Listen to it randomized. But listen.This is a record that quiets you, turns you inside out and takes you on a trip. It's also a perfect CD to play during work. It helps me think. I use Play to get me hyped up. I use 18 to help me settle down. Nature seeks balance.Your expectations were just trumped by the ""little idiot."" Of course, I prefer to call him ""little genius"" -- anyone who writes, produces, records, mixes, and plays all the instruments on a record this incredible is on their way to legend status.According to Moby himself, again, referring to his liner notes essay -- he has written 3,000 songs, most of them he claims are ""bad."" I only hope we get to hear the other 2,982 someday, because these 18 are just spectacular."
1,~bleck!~,"Sorry folks, but this guy is NOT the icon of the electronic culture. So why do thousands of people buy into this ""playing for the people"" pop music? What the artist is really doing is playing for the M-O-N-E-Y. MOBY in days of late has killed what was once considered the MOBY sound. If you really want to hear some good electronics, try looking for MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO's 'Subliminal Sandwich' double disc, or UNDERWORLS's, 'Everything. Everything' DVD. I apologize to all the ""popular"" people to having hurt MOBY's pockets... if anyone even cares to search for real music. L8TeR."
1,Cookie cutter,Moby has a formula. This CD is just another example of it. He pumps 'em out and then exploits the heck out of them. ...! He certainly doesn't do it for the love of it. All his CD's are sounding the same. I gave this one away.
5,Can't believe I finally read it!,"I picked up a copy of this book over ten years ago and it had been collecting dust ever since. The size alone kept me at bay plus my other experiences with ancient authors had led me to assume reading it would be a dull, tedious chore. BOY WAS I WRONG! I had SO much fun reading this book it was hard to believe. I finished it in less than a week (no mean task!). Anyone interested in early Greek culture or the wars with Persia might find a modern work to be more accurate but you'd be hard pressed to find a more ENJOYABLE piece than this one!"
1,Awful Sequel,"This movie is so bad that is not fun. Boring, awful direction, amateurish acting, the plot doesn't make sense. If you thought that SUPERFLY T.N.T. was bad this is worst ( Priest working for the cops to capture the big drug dealers? Give me a break!). Go back and watch the original SUPERFLY which is the one,I am sure, that the guy that gave this one five stars was thinking of. Avoid this one, you have been warned!"
2,A little cumbersome and overwrought,"Had to buy this book for a class. I was unimpressed. The sectioning,layout,and presentation were cumbersome. There was no new information (for me) and the writing and editing were labored, and overwrought. I'd rather have a little more bottom line, a little less minutia. Even the class instructor was not thrilled with her choice."
5,GREAT!!!!,MY FAMILY IS ENJOYING TO WATCH CHARLIE CHAPLIN. GREAT QUALITY. MY 7-YEAR OLD SON HAS SO MUCH FUN. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. PLANNING TO BUY CHAPLIN'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY BOOK.
1,Get Clear details of Soundtrack before buying,I have not seen this particular version of these films but if the highly touted new digital score is just that be careful. I recently bought some of the Mutuals on DVD (by another company) and was disappointed. They also had a new score and absolutely no sound effects. The whole thing made no sense. It was boring as hell.The original music was written by Chaplin and the sound effects were also done by him. (and they are totally hilarious) Without this the films just seem distant and disconnected.(think how pointless the Three Stooges would be without sound effects) I have video tapes of the Mutual Comedies from the '80's with the proper soundtrack and they are truly amazing. Without the real soundtrack you'll just be wondering how anyone could have found any of this funny. Search for the real thing.
3,"Nice, but buy the Restored 90th Anniversary editions instead!","Up until 2006, these were the best copies on DVD. But now David Shepard and Image Entertainment have restored the missing footage and re-mastered the films , addressing the complaints mentioned below.So buy the ""Mutual Restored 90th Anniversary Edition"" instead of this edition.The Essanay comedies are not part of the new restoration, but can be purchased separately."
3,The Hunger Games: Cast Interviews,"It's not bad. Happy that it came with the Blu-ray purchase,The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy] but but otherwise nothing special. The short length doesn't make it look any different that the multitude of interviews that you can find on youtube."
1,"Again again again, WOW Get a PRIME account and watch movies, er, well, a few movies anyway.","Yes, counted as a MOVIE. don't be conned. this is like so many in the ""Prime"" lineup. Not a movie, but another ""cast blah"" or ""featurette"". I have more movies on DVD than Amazon has for so called ""free"" on Prime. Don't get Prime for the movies, don't even consider it a minor plus. It's almost a zero. If you can get $75+ worth of shipping within a year, then get Prime, but not for any of the ""extras"". Prime is really only a ""shipping deal""."
5,This book is free!,"Charging $4 for this is shameful. You don't need to buy this book. You can ask any Jehovah's Witnesses for a free copy, and even a free study if you want assistance. And if you wish to contribute to the world wide work they would be happy to accept your donation and place it in the donation container at their next meeting. Again this book is free! I don't know who's selling this but this is so wrong and very sad. :("
5,The real Zorro has come back!,"When I was a kid, Guy Williams was (and will be forever) the real Zorro. I never missed an episode. The stories are exciting and fun with lots of humor and a supporting cast that has never been surpassed. Everyone is here - lovable Sgt.Garcia, clever Bernardo, the ""wicked"" Commendante (who somehow never seemed quite mean enough, however dastardly his deeds), crusty Don Alejandro, and the horse,Tornado. Missing is the dim-witted Corproal Reyes, but he didn't show up this early in the series, so just wait a while and he'll show up. What more could I ask? True, some purists may be unhappy with the colorized episodes in place of the original black & white, but the colorization here is not bad, and does nothing to detract. Enjoy this Disney classic! There are four more discs for season one, and you will surely want these as well."
1,40 Acres and No Plot,"This was the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. You see, I had to read it for school. I am 13 years old. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not just a stupid 13 year old who hates everything to do with reading; I LOVE to read. I usually like all the books I read, this is the first one I absolutely hated. No offense to the author or anything, but do people really care how she likes her biscuts? Or does she really think we care about the music for the song ""Jesus Hold My Hand""? I mean, give me a break! So those of you who want to read this book, please consider this before wasting your precious money on this excuse for a book."
1,Save your money....,"This book is heavily overpriced and not worth buying. For a non-technical introduction try Amram/Kulatilaka, for the technical introduction read in particular the books by Mun. In my perspective - as a frequent author on real options - this contribution is a complete waste of money (and lots of it I may add)."
5,Superlative guitar atmospherics,"I'll have to second the review below. This is a superb album of chiming guitar atmospherics, with the spectral radiance of light through stained glass. Though it may be an obscure reference, this album brings me to much the same place as the Cocteau Twin's ""Victorialand"" album."
5,Ace the class with this book!,"If you are a visual learner, then you NEED this book. The book covers the material and gets right to the point, providing helpful ways of remembering concepts and helpful diagrams to visualize the many intricacies of biochemistry. I highly recommend this book for anyone taking a course in biochemistry and preparing for the Step 1 exam."
1,Horrible,I'll have to agree that this book was poorly written. This was the first time I have heard of this author but it looks like she has a long way to go.
5,Makita BJR181Z,Lightweight but still rugged and lots of power does what it claims easy to change blades. this unit saves lots of time and easy to handle
2,short on power,Most all of my tools are Makita brand and they are up to par. But this is my first cordless sawzall and it definitely does not have the power that a 110v does. It is a disappointment. I do a lot of remodeling and new construction of homes and use a sawzall continuously. I was using a 110v Makita sawzall for 3 years and operated it until it burned out and I then bought the cordless. I am not happy with it so am going back to a 110v.
1,"Looks pretty, sounds worse than a $4.99 set from Big Lot","My wife insisted that I get her this set of cute pink speakers to go with her new purse.... With the $40 price tag, and creative as the manufacture, seriously didn't think it could be this bad.Cons:Pink color - I have to say it's ugly, especially with the pink color.Quality - Even my speaker set I got from Big Lot for $5 sounds better than these. The high pitches crack completely if volume is more than 30%. Bass is even worse. The maximum volume on this is about 10%, anymore than that, the speaker completely breaks up.Price - $40 for a pair of speakers that performs worse than $5 speakers, it's sad for a reputable company like Creative to even make this junk.Pros:Bought it from Amazon. Fortunately it's returnable.If you must have PINK speakers, then buy another set and paint it pink. Stay away from these, these speakers belong in the $0.99 stores."
4,good for me,"First of all, i want to say that i bought these speakers from their website and they were on sale for $10 + shipping $20, they are great for what i use them for (listening to in my room) however, they don't have the GREATEST sound, but for 20 bucks what do you expect? however, I definitely wouldn't pay any more than that for these. I also found that the little blue light on it (that shows when its on and off) is really bright, so when i'm laying in my bed at night listening to music i have to cover it up with something otherwise the whole room is lit up by this florescent blue light. (which gets pretty annoying) And also WARNING the color is NOT at all like how they show in the pictures, it is more like a silver-ish purple color, which is actually a cool color, so if the color isn't a big deal to you then it's nice. So over all i like how they look and they're great to just plug your ipod in to and listen to while you're in your room, so yeah what i use them for they're great."
2,Blur's modern music is rubbish!,"Hats off to being different then! It used to be that the boys of blur would pen a good, solid and highly creative pop song that people could get behind and enjoy. Now, it's all sloppy guitars dripping with feedback and very little song structure. I suppose the launching pad for all of this can be found on their last self-titled CD where they took a stab at new forms of music. I understand the need to attempt new forms to keep things interesting, but if you get way too far out there, you run the risk of ailienating your core fans. There are some songs that work here like ""Coffee and TV"" and the opening ""Tender."" Both sound much like the Blur of old, and those are both the CD's most sonically pallatible tracks. The rest is like filler for your ear. For Blur's best work, check out either ""Leisure"" or ""Modern Life is Rubbish,"" released in 1991 and 1993 respectively."
4,wicked is all i can say,"The first time i listened to this cd I thought, what is this? This is not the same blur that i have been listening to since 1991. The second time I listened to it, I fell in love with tender and got goosebumps when bugman came on. Now I can't stop listening to this cd! It's adventurous, experimental and chaotic. Every listen offers a new experience. This release would have got five stars but I am reserving the five star award for their 1993 release, Modern Life is Rubbish."
2,Disappointing.,"I'm sure Blur were trying to ""progress"" or something, but here it didn't really work. I bought the album on the strength of the three singles, Tender, Coffee and TV and No Distance Left To Run, which remain three of Blur's best songs, but I'm afraid to say that the rest of the album seems more like pretentious rubbish than anything else. It's like Kid A Radiohead but it doesn't grow on you from a weird experience into an intense emotional one. It just stays boring, uninspired and more like the strange fair-ground music on Parklife than End Of A Century."
3,its OK,"The last album was better but this one isn't that bad. ""Bugman"" is a cool song so is ""cofee & tv"". ""No Distance Left To Run"" is a very sad song that really makes you think about past relationships. 13 is Ok, hopefully it will get better with each listen like the last album did."
5,I have heard only one song. It'll be a hit.,"I haven't heard but one song(Tender) and I'm going to buy the CD based on it. I really like the choir background and it is so different from their last record. The contrast between the two is really cool. Usually a band will produce the same type of music that they originally presented to the public, and eventually it gets boring. You just expect to here the singers in their regular voice singing from a particular source. Blur really surprised me with this song and I will start listning to them as much as I can. I think that what they did should be an inspiration to other groups. It will draw in customers and cash. So much diversity between albums, and even songs really gets people interested about what else that group will come up with. I was impressed."
4,Fundamentals of Modern Physics,"This buy was very good. The seller made a exact description of book and your price was just. The unique problem is the time of arrival, but it is inevitable, because I live in Brazil."
3,Cool Force Powers!Addictive and The most short game ever!,"Reviewer:AdrielOK,I get the game,I'm so addicted,eyes glued to the screen,then,within 2 days,I beat the entire game!Unlockable levels?Nope.Graphics:3/5 a little cartoony,but still OKSound:4/5 can't get enough of the lightsaber sounds.Gameplay:2/5 Fun and addictive,but too short short short!Storyline:5/5 just like the moviereplayability:4/5 love lightsaber duelsfustration:5/5 I was so fustrated when it was this shortAI [artificial intelligence] the enemies are mindless,and take too long to attack!Overall:65%DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"
5,Definitly the best game boy advance cartidge I own!,"Star wars episode III Revenge of the sith is a great NES style beat em up game. I played through all 26 levels in about 2 or 3 weeks. After that I decided to try out my brother in law's ps2 copy. I found many similarities between the two! One example is the enemy's, Remember those huge super battle droids that had claws and could electrocute you? There in this version. You get to play 13 levels as Anikan and 13 levels as Obiwan. Which by the way is longer than the ps2 copy. For the first 4 levels you just play the same levels from each one's perspective. There are some really cool boss battles! Like Mace Windu, General Greivous, And eventually you fight Anikan... Or obiwan, it depends on which character you play as. This game was great fun. Please buy it so that you can just as much with as I did."
5,Yummy!,"A wonderful book that you won't want to put down. It reminded me of Elizabeth Berg in that you get intwined in the lives of the characters and want the best for them. The only problem with this book is that the descriptions of the breads are so good, you'll want to sit down with a loaf and eat it as you read!"
2,"You bring the whine, I'll bring the cheese!","It's cheesy! It's predictable~It's a lot of whine about bread. Although I can appreciate Wyn's passion for making bread, that's the best part and the best I can say about the book."
2,Love it but one pattern is giving me trouble!,I was attracted to this book mainly for the Cozy Kerchief pattern-and I can't create it!! Sorry to say but so far I'm left to assume that the pattern is not only flawed but incomplete. I feel positive about the other patterns.
5,VOLUME 13????,"according to ADV they do plan to release a volume 13 in the future. However, they are still unsure of how much longer we must wait for future chapters of saint seiya. I can only hope they realease them fast, at least the whole sanctuary series."
2,Does Not Keep Hot 5 Hours,"I bought this thermos for my 7 year old son so he could pack his mac and cheese for lunch.I love that it is just the perfect size for his little hands, the looks are clean,the price was great and the product says ""Keeps Hot 5 Hours"". I was hoping it would but it did not. I took the advice of some reviews and pored hot water into the thermos first but that did not work. By lunch time (5 hours later), it was cold.I imagine this would be great for cold products like fruits or milk. Although I am disappointed in the HOT part, I will keep the handsome thermos for cold stuff."
2,Disappointing - no good for warm lunches,"Very disappointing. At most this will keep food warm for 2-3 hours. I try to use this for my daughter's school lunch and end up having to pre-heat the flask with boiling water first to reduce heat transfer when I put in the extremely hot food, and then also wrap the whole flask in kitchen towels, before putting this in an insulated lunch box. It provides a lukewarm lunch after 4 hours.I would expect much better from Thermos. The fact that the wall of the flask is warm on filling is a real giveaway that the vacuum (or, more likely, cheap insulation) is just not effective.Pros: good portion size, durable, wide mouth, handy folding spoon.Cons: does not keep food warm for more than a very short time."
4,Good short book on the Politics of Islam,"This book focuses on the political aspects of Islamic thought from the time of the Prophet to present time. It addresses Islamic law (Fiqh), the history of Islamic rulers (and the ruled), and revolution. The book is presented primarily (although not entirely) from a Sunni perspective.The book is extremely well documented. There are 116 pages of text in the main body of the book and 41 pages of notes supporting those 116 pages! The book is a great starting point for research in the politics of Islam."
2,Not much logic here,"The problem with this book is the writing style of the author. I had to re-read some pages three or four times and I still had no idea what he was talking about and I use logic every day!I found going back to the manual much more helpful 90% of the time. As Logic books go, it's dated and missing a lot of information. The section on dealing with VST instruments is few pages long and I think thats dates it more than anything.The author spends a inordinate time talking about setting up a midi environment and skipping over all the things that make logic so powerful.Most of the book reads like a laundry list to be honest. No real world examples are given. A shame really.Crack open the manual and experiment. I think that will be much more rewarding than any time you spend with this book."
4,Imelda Staunton is fearless,"Imelda Staunton is fearless and superb in her role as Vera Drake, a woman who care for her family and others in post WW2 London. She also assists women who need abortions and have nowhere else to turn. But the method she uses can cause serious problems, and this is how she gets caught.The emotions run high in the Drake family when they find out what she has done and what kind of fate she faces. The films also makes the viewer ponder how difficult it must have been in 1950 to deal with an unwanted pregnancy, whether the result of rape or something else."
1,Saintly abortionist?,"The genre of movies about ""saintly abortionists"" deserves equal standing with movies centered on ""paternal slave owners"" and ""soft-hearted death camp commandants."" There is nothing saintly about dismembering unborn babies no matter how much a director chooses to manipulate people's emotions.I'm curious to see how many ""unhelpfuls"" I manage to collect with this candid assessment."
3,a good read,this book is not as good as the first but i still enjoyed reading it and it definately improved after part one ... i will most definitely purchase the final book in the trilogy when it is published
1,Flimsy,"One of the flimsy plastic hinges was broken when we received this seat and the other broke while taking it out of the box. The only good thing I can say about this seat is that it came with a step stool which we still use. For my second purchase, I decided to go with the ""Family Seat"" made of MDF and am much happier. The material is more durable, the hinges are stronger, and I am going to buy another one for our second bathroom."
4,Gorgeous Music!!!,"What can I say but simply ""gorgeous"" is the word that comes to mind when I listen to this CD. I heard Dishwalla about a month ago on ""Late Night with Craig Kilborn"". They played the song ""Home"" from Oplaline. Their lead singer has a perfectly mellow voice. I've only been listening to it for about a week, but I'm finding more and more to appreciate with each listen. So far, the tracks that stand out are ""Angels and Devils"", ""Somewhere in the Middle"" and ""Home"".Note to all you hard rock fans: This isn't hard rock music for all your headbangers, just a smooth Adult Alternative rock CD that does a lot with melody and some nice rock touches here and there. That combined with the lead singer's serenely smooth voice will give you something to listen to when you just want to mellow out"
5,an important step,"As a Dishwalla fan, I was just happy that they released something after four quiet years. This one is as good as the first two and it's a little more mellow too. At first I wasn't thrilled with it, but it grew on me fast.best tracks are2>Angels and Devils - 5/5 my favorite track, one of their best3>Somewhere in the Middle - 5/5 the first single (not that I've seen or heard it anywhere) really nice8>Mad Life - 5/5 after four softer acoustic songs, an innovative song that's as good as anything they've releasedi think that some of the songs remind me of U2. if U2 did sing these, they'd be #1 hits. oh well"
5,JUST PERFECT,This is just an amazing album! I was contact because they were out of stock and then they sent me one signed by the band!
5,Hepa Bag,The Kirby brand Hepa bag made my old kirby work great. I had previously been buying a different brand and modifying them to make them fit. What a waist of time and money that was.
5,Think about your life!,"Think about your life! Veronika, a young woman, wants to die. She swallows sleeping pills, but didn't die. She got to a mental hospital. She was told to live only for five days or a week. Still she wanted to die. But after some time she learned to show her feelings and began to enjoy her life. She didn't have to worry about what she did, because soon she would die. She realised that it also need a certain ""madness"" to live. She began to fight for her future and fell in love with a man. If you read the book you would think about your own life and it gives your more courage to live your own life."
4,"Humor, sorrow, a wonderful read","Thoroughly enjoyable. This book was written with humor but also heart wrenching honesty. I wasn't sure about the book after the first rew pages, but continued to be drawn in until I was sold and invested in all the characters.I will now read all of Paulo Coelho's work."
3,His books r always gr8 but this is lesser gr8 :),"I am definitely a big Paulo Coelho fan. I will never say bad or ok to any of his good bcoz as we all know he is a gr8 writer. But however, i didnt like this book as much I have loved reading his other books. I would say if u want to choose between any two of his books go with the other one, but if u have to choose between paulo and some other writer, by default go for Paulo."
2,Lifeless,"It seems that most people reviewing this book are reviewing the message (""Life is good"") rather than the book. Sure, the moral of the story makes you feel good, but that doesn't mean that the book is well done; in fact, the novel itself is weak. The story goes nowhere, the characters are as dead as Veronika wishes to be, and the ending is obvious from the beginning. Maybe it reads better in Portugese, but this one left me colder than the Slovenian winter."
3,Not quite worth my time,"I picked up Veronica Decides to Die on the airport and read about 30 pages before I fell asleep. Always wanting to give books a second try I picked it up a couple of days later but found it not worth my time. This is my first book by Coelho and I admit I became curious about him and his message to the world. To me he sounds like a priest or some kind of guru for a sect but this may be wrong :) Veronica Decides to Die is not a bad book, but for an experienced reader it certainly has a number of serious flaws, among them an over-explicitness that shouldn't be necessary, but that fits into my impression of Coelho as a man with an urge to express common (though important) ideas with a common man's pen. Coelho's ideas about madness and the value of life and love have been expressed more originally and more beautifully by numerous other writers."
3,Ahhhhh!!!!,"Half way through the book I figured out how it was going to end, but it was a clever ending and an easy fast read."
5,Amazing perception of what insanity truly is + an unexpected ending!,"Really enjoyed the book. Lots of great quotes and ideas on what insanity truly is, and the ending totally caught me off guard!READ IT."
1,Veronika=An Insignificant read,"When I heard of this story I was intrigued as to what Paulo Coelho had to say about a girl who attempted a failed suicide but knew she would still die within five days. The lessons learned here could be quite insightful and incredibly touching, especially since her fate has been pre-determined by her actions. Unfortunately, I found the author's use of the third person at the beginning of the novel to be rather pretentious, and the ending to be especially cliche. If Coelho hadn't put a twist on the plot, the ending would have had better closure and meaning. Instead, it became another hackneyed story about a girl committing a plea suicide, something much too familiar and far less memorable."
2,Substandard,"Plenty of writers have examined clinical psychology and the people who practice it, challenging the standards of sanity, the therapies, and the operation of mental institutions. And most of their books are a lot better than Veronika Decides to Die. Paulo Coelho doesn't really add anything to what's already been said on the subject.Granted, this is the only work of Coelho's that I've read, and I'm reading it in translation, so I may not be getting the full effect. But so far as I can tell, this book is a series of serious missteps interspersed with only minor displays of skill.I'm ceding it two stars because it's brief and simple, but that's the best thing I can think of to say about it."
1,Veronika a Bad Taste Reading!,"I started to read this book and I stoped, because I can't stand Paulo Coelho cheap ideas and writing. If you are into real literature this book is not for you. SUCKS!!!!"
4,"Good book, gorgeous annexes","I've been reading and studying this book for over 4 months as the main book of a requirements engineering subject of a master in informatics.Most chapters in this book are good (7.- Functional requirements / 8.- Nonfunctional requirements), others are gorgeous (3.- Project Blastoff), and others just a little poor (5.- Trawling for requirements).But the most interesting part of this book are the 164 pages of the two annexes. They are just a excellent way for approaching to the requirements process with many examples that can guide anyone to a final solution in any requirements problem."
2,Fatal Fundamental Flaws (cont),"this book has not only the flaws identified below by F.C.Passavant - in addition it has inconsistencies in terminology, lots of ambiguity. it was difficult to map described precesses to those regarded in the field (i.e. IATF Release 3.1)I found ""Requirements Engineering"" by Elizabeth Hull, Kenneth Jackson, and Jeremy Dick a much better choice."
5,Wonderfully Positive,I was asked to read this book by someone and give my opinion on it. Well I couldn't have been more pleased. It was encouraging to see how family and friends could come together and be there for one another without exception. The relationship that Terry had with Jackie shows how it's suppose to be done. It doesn't give you unrealistic views. You know that they have gone through their issues but their love for one another and their faith in God transcends it all. It also shows what happens when your priorities are screwed up and you're only out for self. It was refreshing to read a novel that depicts our black men as strong and supportive instead of elusive and disrespectful. I believe it gives positive reinforcement to people to keep striving to do the right thing and not fall into the rut that stereotypes has placed us in. Keep up the good work Parry Brown. I look forward to your next work.
3,A little too mushy!,"The story line itself was good and kept you wanting to go on. Thank God for the author who gave a positive book on black men. I know they exist and I'm glad someone else made it known.While I applaud the author on a positive book about black men, it was just a little too mushy, to the point of being nerve wracking. There was alway ""so much love"" ""she loved so much"" ""everyone was sooo happy"" ""and there couldn't have been more love"" It was like, okay we get it, they are in love and they are happy!"
2,What A Disappoinment!,"My initial thoughts were ""finally, here is a novel which would refute the myth surrounding our Black men."" Less than halfway into the book, I developed a serious headache - especially after reading Momma C's dialect. The characters were ridiculously phony - you really couldn't get more fictional than that! The plot was underdeveloped and surprisingly I did something I haven't done....I refused to finish the book - it was just that bad.There was so much potential with this novel, yet Parry Brown was unable to attain it! I skimmed through all the reviews (on this site) prior to reading ""The Shirt Off His Back"" and I agree wholeheartedly with Reviewer 'valree76' - see below or above. Her review sums it up to a ""T""."
4,Frabjous,"I applaud Parry Brown for conflating such a magnificent tale. As one who was raised by my father, I could identify with the unsurmountable love that Terry had for his daughters, and the selfishness that the sagacious Catherine displayed. This story is a vociferous wake up call to all who label all men as dead beat fathers. Parry Brown showed that auspiciousness isn't enough to raise children. Surprisingly, Catherine's misopeida is not uncommon among ""the 90's"" women. Brown's personfification of this often overlooked characteristic was profound. ""The Shirt Off His Back"" is a magnificent story of fatherly love, treasured devotion, and unsurmountable commitment. It's refreshing and a pleasure to read. I can speak from experience in expressing that this story is not far fetched or fairy taled."
1,Bad Product,"The product I purchased was an Apple Care Plan for my IMac. The bottom line is that a great deal of retailers are selling this but only a few are authorized resellers. This retailer is not. If you purchase this product from any source other than an authorized Apple Retailer your taking a chance. My box was unopened with a wrapper on it. This has no barring on it's authenticity in fact it is only part of the ruse. My product did not work, it had been registered to someone in Europe. Apple knows by the number who has registered it so they will not allow you to complete the process. This is all the advise I can give you. On the up side the retailer did refund my money but made the claim they too are a victim. I'll take them on face value however, if your looking for a genuine copy of a Apple Care Plan buy it from an authorized dealer."
5,Love it!,My 2yr old twins love playing with these pieces in the tub. They stick them all over the walls and even on each other's back.
4,Very pretty and unusual nightlight,I love all things plumeria. This is very pretty and unique nightlight. Lights up nicely.
5,Love this book!,I am not a self help book reader but this one is great and very easy and quick to read!
3,Screwdrivers tip,"My Craftsman screwdrivers tend to tilt left or right about 30-degrees in this unit. It's not too hard to get a screwdriver to stay standing up straight, but it takes a little finesse to do it every time, especially without disturbing neighboring screwdrivers. Smaller screwdrivers (e.g. Phillips size #0) tend to be very difficult. I prefer the other multi-tool design that provides an upper lower wire loop, since it is easier to quickly put a screwdriver away, and have it self-balance."
5,Masterfully written by Wallace and Marcus,I greatly enjoyed reading NDiIR. I feel that Wallace and Marcus clearly know their subject. The book definitely showed the way to run a successful Investor Relations program. I would definitely recommend it to anyone excperienced in Investor Relations or just starting out. Well done Wallace and Marcus!
4,"Definite ""Eye Candy""!","This is not a ""how to"" book in any sense, but it can provide inspiration when the ""visual arts muse"" has abandoned you. I keep this book around for those moments when I am looking for ideas, or when I just can't figure out how to create a certain effect that I can see perfectly in my mind. The broad overviews of what it took to create the different images will drive beginners nuts, but will provide more experienced Photoshop users with enough information to charge ""gaily forward"" into their own creative endeavors!"
2,An interesting story undone by lugubrious writing,"Luca Turin may or may not be a genius, but it's hard to tell from this overly written fawning account which breaks nearly every rule of journalistic writing, zipping in and out of Turin's head, jumping between past and present, omitting several major pieces of information, and worst of all, getting facts out and out wrong. Maybe it was the perfume, but something seems to have gone to Burr's head because the book is laced with writing so overdone and flowery that if it were a perfume, it would an Avon special. There is a good story about the problems with the scientific process in here, but Burr doesn't get to it."
3,"Too Much for my ""C Average"" Brain","Based on the book description I was really looking forward to reading this book. And I'm sure it is really a fascinating read with tremendous intellectual value.Unfortunately, my mind completely fogged over when I attempted to read it. There is a great deal of chemistry in this book, chemistry is unfortunately a foreign language I never picked up with any fluency.After stumbling through a few chapters I gave up. Maybe I'll try again in a few years."
4,Air Mail Music: Fado,"This is another great album sung by one of my favorites Lucialia Do Carmo. If you like fado, then she is a singer you shouldn't miss to hear. Her sultry voice is is emotional and sad and that is what fado is about. Sadness, fate, feelings."
5,VIDEO DUAL MONITOR,"Great product, it does split video signal... I have it in 3 monitors at the same time and has no degradation image. I haven't be able to test the item to run 120 feet (acording to manufacturer) but for me, it works, I wil recommended it"
3,Some episodes are pointless,I was curious for this anime for sometime and really i would've perfered to stay curious and not wasted my money with this one for i had my hopes up high. This series doesn't really try to seperate itself from other animes as the action seems restrained and some stories seem pointless. One thing that this anime has though is Fan service. Yep that's about it oh and crossdressers... Oh yeah and it has cops which have boring pasts that make no real development. Either way if you were looking for some cop action of some sort you won't really find it here for the action is lame and it doesnt really connect to burn up W for some odd reason. If you actually want to see realistic police type genere I would recomend You under arrest its not really that bad but its not really that good except for the fanservice. The endeding was decent but I've seen better.
3,Lacks the Depth Needed to Pass the Exam,"This book reads well, but it lacks the depth you will need to score well on the exam, which is nearly all scenario-based.In addition, the actual test is much more difficult than the practice test on the CD-ROM included with this book.To do well, I strongly recommend that you download and read the MSIE 5 Corporate Deployment Guide.Above all, focus on security! Know the default settings for all zones. Know what options are available with each installation role - corporate, content provider, and service provider.Good luck!"
2,Difficult to Follow,I found it very difficult to follow. To many little sections which made it difficult. If you could figure out how to follow its flow then maybe you could enjoy the information obtain in the book.
5,cetaphil,cetaphil is extremely easy to use. it was reccommended by my dermatologist and i already see results after only 2 weeks. ive tried MANY acne cleansing products and this is by far the best._it washes off easily_does not irritate skin_gets rid of acne_makes your face softer and smoother
5,Very well made for the money,"If you're looking for a good wheelchair to get you around for a couple of months for two broken legs, you can't beat this deal for $140 and free shipping from Amazon."
5,Well made. Excellent value.,This chair is well made with good attention to detail. It rolls easily and can be maneuvered by a smaller person. Seat is comfortable.
5,VERY INSPIRING!,"I'm a person without pay-tv, so being able to see this show is such a treat. Almost anyone will tell you, watching this show makes you want to organize and clean your own house, at least that is how me and my friends see it. I watched the whole season in a couple days and then did a thorough cleaning of my garage, then did a pre-Christmas selling trip to the swap meet, followed by the thrift store. Now I am ready to order another season-- but to dismay, it appears that the only other episodes on DVD are Season two- Part One!! I'm hoping that more become available. I know I could watch it online probably, but I really don't like to watch things on the computer. Plus, this is a program I'll watch again & again, so it'd worth it to own it on dvd."
5,Just the right workout,"This workout is set perfectly. Everything is done in 15 minute intervals and your completly worked out, and it's fun!"
2,Trying to be too many things in one book,"I read this book prior to reading any of the reviews; and I have to say that I agree with the editorial review. The author tried to put in too many things without developing the characters. There is one chapter that feels like it was misplaced, right in the middle of two consecutive chapters because it could not have happened in the time frame that was discussed. It didn't even make sense that the author put in this particular chapter in the first place. I almost feel that the other readers fell in love with other book(s) written by Ms. Michael, and were just happy to have another book!"
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!!,"Fern Michaels does it again. This book is wonderful & the Vegas books are just great! The characters are so wonderful, you really feel like you know them. Recommend highly getting these books as you just can't put any of them down until you finish them. Loved it!"
4,A Fine Documentary on Underrated Art,"Empire of the Nude is an episode of the BBC series ""Omnibus"", produced to accompany the recent exhibition and book ""Exposed: the Victorian Nude."" The film explores the history of the nude in 19th-century British art and its connection to visions of Empire. It also makes clear that the Victorian era, despite its reputation for repression, was a time of freedom and exploration of sexuality, art, and the body."
1,"She is getting worse, far worse. Must be a contract filler book.","Catherine Coulter's Point(less) Blank shoots blanks like watermelon seeds.Horrible. Childish. Lame, unbelievable and inept. Yes, I know she has written more than eight prior novels, but each one is getting noticeably worse than the previous effort.This is by far the worst. Honestly, has anyone ever had personal dealings with any FBI agents? I have. Many times. The idea of one of them getting bashed on the head while solo spelunking, losing her memory, then coming out in the forest right next to a single dad, small town Sheriff? Riiight. Of course he befriends her and her partners (A married couple, no less), and they fall in love with his sons.All four improbably join forces and become a merry, happy, smiling, friendly gang of crime fighters.Wait. I need a bucket.Of course the female FBI agent finds the hidden civil war gold in her cave.I am going to be sick again.The only thing worse than the plot is the dialogue. Far worse."
2,Let Down,"Point Blank had me all the way through; then let me down at the end. I don't like investing time reading 425 pages of mystery only to have one of the main threads (who killed Christie, Dillon's wife) left unanswered. I admit the author held my interest and entertained me right up there with James Patterson and John Kellerman, but Point Blank's ending...it was like Ms. Coulter suddenly remembered she had something more important to do and she deserted me! Not only was a main thread left open, all threads were wrapped up poorly. Is a sequel planned here?"
2,Good book - until you got to the end.,"I picked up this book at the bookstore because the monthly book guide said it was a ""guaranteed great read."" Well, I started the book, and it WAS a pretty good book - until I got to the end where it was as if the author was running out of time or something and didn't connect all of her dots. The ending was VERY unsatisfying. None of the questions were really answered - portions of the mystery that seem to be the most important are just glossed over with literally something like a ""we don't know what happened"" perspective. I could not believe that the author would go to the trouble to write such a complex and detailed story - a story that had potential to be a great story - and then not bother to finish it. I liked the book, but the ending was so bad that I it just ruined the whole thing for me. I have never read any of Catherine Coulter's books before this one, but if this is one of her best, I would hate to read her worst."
3,DISAPPOINTED...,"In my humble opinion, too many characters convoluted this novel's storylines (2 running parallel). I also found myself dissatisfied with the ending. A sort of ""That's it?"" feeling. Hints of budding romance but no follow-through. Disappointed. This one will be going into the donation box."
1,What happened to the old Catherine?,"I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who noted the two disjointed plot lines. Why? Not enough material to write a book which develops just one set of players? I loved Savich and Sherlock when they were in their first book - and that is where they should have stayed. Robert B. Parker and his ""Spencer"" character they are not! They don't add much to this book except confusion. I miss the good old days...The Maze, The Cove, etc...The new characters Ruth and Dix almost take a back seat to them and are never fully developed. Will they be the basis for the next book? I think the author needs a vacation..."
3,Color and locking,"I thought this was a sage colored playard, it came beige. Also it can be difficult to get mine to lock all its joints open, so we don't take it down / put it up again to take on trips."
2,If you loved Forever War - DON'T READ THIS BOOK!,"Forever Free is not only a terrible sequel to Haldeman'sForever War, it is a terrible book in its own right - [it is] preachy [and takes] from Heinlein, Star Trek and others, it even has a ridiculous Scooby Doo ending. If you have read any of Haldeman's previous works (which are great!) you will be utterly dissapointed by this book."
1,FOREVER CRAP!,"This has got to be one of the worst scifis I have ever read. Typical 70's scifi writing style unimaginatively depicting a low tech future. When the author runs out of drivel, his one dimensional characters just describe the surounding scenes.The premise of the book is that the minority of humans who dont want to join the majority group-mind that mankind has become, embark on a quest to see what path humanity has taken 40,000 years in the future. The problem is the author pathetically cops out of this plot line - by having god decide that all of humanity is now a cancelled experiment and everyone just disapears! thats the whole book! Stupid! stupid! stupid!"
3,"great, until...","the STUPID ending. I loved Forever War and Forever Peace, but.... why switch over to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy like that, Joe?"
2,NOT LIKE THEY USED TO BE,"Pretty dissapointing, I used to LOVE going to the show... now i'm not so sure it's worth it... the guitar riffs are catchy in a few spots, but nothing compared to the olden day nodes... the vocals are the biggest let down. what happened?!?!?"
3,just alright,What can you say about a plant light? It works and the plants grow. However it's a little hard to hang on the wall.
5,Fantastic Read,"A truly original vampire story with a twist on the Bible. I enjoyed it immensely, this is the kind of book you can't put down once you've started reading it."
2,Forgettable Scribes,I read a review that described this as a horror story. It turned out to be another vampire romance novel. Apparently the author is a male version of Anne Rice. It should have had Fabio with fangs on the front cover.
4,Very Realistic Coming of Age Story,"I really like this movie because it makes the main character deal with the consequences of her actions in a real way while not making her parents appear uncaring and cold. Not to say that there aren't films out there that don't do this, it's just that the consequences Mikael/Laure has to deal with are more true to form then say... your average sugar-coated John Hughes movie and at such a young age. I won't go too much into detail, as I do not want to spoil the movie. I will say that I have seen other films by Céline Sciamma and this one does not disappoint. The main actresses of this movie are very talented and convey a naturalness in their scenes that is amazing to watch. How refreshng to watch kids actually behaving as kids without it seeming contrived. This is a good movie that does not disappoint!"
1,Don't take your chances (think you're going to save money with this?),"This program was difficult to use, with a counter-intuitive user interface, complicated scheduling sequences, and at least on my computer - faulty software altogether. Constant error messages, inability to restore individual files successfully, and time/date stamps that were reading the year 2047, and no way to change that, etc...I bought this instead of Acronis True Image, because I wanted to save the $15 bucks. I figured as a single-computer, ""home"" use, I didn't need a program with advanced features.So. The question is, was the 15 bucks saved worth hours and hours of head-scratching, and months of lacking of true backup protection?Finally, I bought Acronis True Image Home 10, and set it up and had it running to my needs in under an hour. It works, it's professional-grade. Imagine your HD crashes. Imagine how much time you might have to spend to get up and running again. Is that worth skimping 15 bucks?"
2,Too soft and commercial. Buy Blue lines instead!,This CD disappointed me because it's too soft and let's say commercial for me. I don't see the interest of covering Light my fire for Massive Attack when they can right something like Karmacoma. We're so far from the emotion and sound of Blue lines!
3,Albums too short,"All of Massive Attack's albums are too short. I do like the beats, 9 or 10 is hard for me to shell out ten bucks for. They are not hard to produce, and many more would fit on a cd. So why not increase the value?Other producers like Madlib or Dilla release albums with 20-30 tracks, they are shorter (around 2 min. each) but you get more variety. And when listening to ""Trip Hop"" a 5+ minute song is a bit long. I'm putting this on my wish list for now, but not buying yet. I recommend Theivery Corporation."
3,its good but their 1998 album is the timeless one,Massive Attack's first two albums suffer because they can be dated. They are so 1990's. Their 1998 album is timeless. Buy that one first.
4,"Interesting, albeit frustratingly uneven","There are lot of interesting songs here, but the album lacks direction. In fact, the songs lead into a terrible closer, ""Light My Fire."" The cover features annoying-as-ever vocals by Horace Andy in what may be the worst cover I have ever heard. However, there are still some memorable tracks here.Karmacoma, Better Things, and Heatmiser remind me of why this album is still so listenable. The Nicolette tracks are decent, but they fail to achieve greatness... there's just something missing. Her tracks sometimes seem, well, emotionless.Grades:Protection: B+Karmacoma: A+Three: BWeather Storm: B+Spying Glass: B-Better Things: A+Eurochild: BSly: B+Heatmiser: ALight My Fire: F"
5,Stephen Collins - The Hits of Rick Nelson,"Very, very good. An excellent CD. Almost as good as Rick Nelson was himself."
5,Excellent Manchester Sound,"This is not only the best album of the Verve but also the best Manchester Sound. It's very LaoLuan and NiuBi.If you like morden Brit-pop,this album is your first choice."
4,One of the best of the late 90s,"The Verve's final album does not offer anything dramatically innovative or different from many other Europeans acts the US has imported from Europe over the past 30 years. Influence from U2, The Who and the Beatles are all obviously present. It does offer 13 honest, confessional, passionate, captivating tracks that make one long for the stylings of the the bands who obviously meant so much to the Verve and a time when music this honest and pure came out every week. A super sensory album."
3,Not bad,"This is a pretty good CD. I like the lyrical value of songs like Come On, Bitter Sweat Symphony (Kind of a ""Don't F--k with me, I'm pissed"" kind of deal, it is so so so so so easy to relate to so so so so so often) Sonnet and Lucky Man. I love Nick McCabe's killer guitar work on Come On and The Rolling People. He's an A-class guitar player! But too often the lyrics enter Hal-mark terrotory! Like Catching That Butterfly or One Day. Not a bad effort, but not a good one either."
2,very disappointing,"i bought this because i heard the verve compared to radiohead, spiritualized, and the my bloody valentine ""shoegazing"" genre, all of which i like a lot -- except for a couple of songs, it's garbage. it sounds more to me like third eye blind with brit-pop credibility. i can't wait to get rid of it.the songs appear to be written around the vocals, which are generally sappy and never anything special, and the talented musicians that are supposedly in this band don't do anything beyond formulaic. they don't even contribute to the songwriting (done almost entirely by the singer), which is perhaps why the verve broke up.maybe i should listen to their earlier albums, they must be good because how else could this band acquire such a good reputation?"
3,I was disappointed....,"I like ""Bittersweet Symphony"" . Other tracks on this CD are average at best. Many (if not most) drone on and on. The lyrics didn't do much for me either."
2,Urban lies,"At the time of it's release, this album was praised by some critics as being the rebirth of ""serious"" music in the wake of the ""ironic"" brit-pop era. But seriousness does not always mean good. Built around anthemic and pompous sondscapes, the lyrics are self pitying. ""I want to her some sounds that recognize the pain in me"" Ashcroft sings in Bittersweet Symphony. Granted, we need to belong and relate. But then he goes ""Happiness / more or less / is just a change in me /something in my liberty"".It's too literal and it doesent talk to anybody but himself. Sorry, but we don't need selfpity."
2,"Great Band, Excellent Songs, Terrible Vinyl","This is one of my all time favorite albums that I had on CD for years. Not sure what happened to the band. They were great. The reason I rated this product two stars is because I ordered two copies of this album on vinyl from Amazon and they both had the same exact problem. The last track on side ""C"" (second album) skips. I could see maybe this happening on one copy, but when it was the same on both I figure it must be a problem with the manufacturer. So, buy this if you don't mind one song being unplayable. I'll buy it when the problem is fixed."
2,Weak Hymns,"Three or four songs aside (""Bittersweet Symphony"", ""Sonnet"", ""Lucky Man"" and little else), this record is just a highly disappointing, average, bland and overrated product. It`s hard to believe that critics chose this as one of the best albums of the nineties, since it sounds terribly dated and it wasn`t all that innovative and edgier by the time it came out anyway.""Urban Hymns"" is britpop by-the-numbers, a combo of predictable and forgettable songs that rarely surpass the safe territory. Richard Ashcroft isn`t a great singer, his voice range is limited and the melodies of most of the compositions sound almost the same. The lyrics go from typical romance situations to that ""I`m so special and strange, but nobody understands me"" attitude. So, there`s nothing really new or interesting to find here, it`s just another listenable yet unsurprising rock record.There are much better hymns out there."
3,Social Work: Is it for you?,"Opportunities in Social Work helps individuals determine if their rewarding career needs to include helping others. Those who choose social work are motivated to make a real difference in the lives of those in need by assisting and empowering people with problems in their every day lives and by helping improve economic conditions in society. This book looks at the history of the helping profession, gives suggestions for today, and looks into hopefulness for the future."
2,For parents of tots only,"I was disappointed that this book talked only about children identified as gifted when in preschool or earlier. The anecdotes and examples all refer to children less than 8, usually less than 6. It is not uncommon for a child to be identified or maybe even BECOME? gifted until later. I know several kids who weren't ""certifiably"" gifted until 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades, even one in the 7th grade. I was hoping for more information on identifying giftedness in these 'older' children."
2,WAS not IMPRESSED,"Just got this book and did not make it past the last chapter. I guess I assumed that some parts of it would be more serious. Although I love ELLEN and her talk show..I wanted to know more about her as a person. I was not impressed with the humor in this book either. Seemed like a bunch of rambling on to me.I should have read more about what the book was about before purchasing it. So if you are looking for some weird humor go for it. Otherwise, leave it alone."
4,Very enjoyable and hilarious!,"I have been a longtime fan of Ellen, and her book is no disappointment. It provides an insight to her life and her sense of humor is wonderful."
4,Biography by Ellen Degeneres,"Remarkably nice. Seen her hosting on tv. Now reading her book. The chapters are short yet straight to the point, no beating 'round the bushes. Pretty interesting & really make my day."
1,the funny thing is NOT FUNNY,"Very disappointing, dull and boring. Don't waste your money on this. I liked ellen before I listened to this nonsense."
2,Recycled Material,"While this book is probably enjoyable if you're not already an ""Ellen fan,"" it is really all recycled stand-up material. I found myself skipping entire chapters because it was a word-for-word recount of previously used stand-up jokes. I have to admit that the jokes were funny, but I was hoping after paying $23 to get some new material.Also, in my opinion, what makes Ellen so funny is not necessarily her material, but it's the way she delivers the joke...her voice inflections, her facial expressions, and her subtle pauses. Without these additions the jokes aren't half as good for me personally."
5,Great gift,This and the other Ellen book my daughter didn't already have were great gifts for Christmas. My daughter (17) said she was laughing out loud...hearing your child laugh (no matter what age) is music to a mom's heart so definitely a 10 on the good gift scale.
1,Lame,"The funny this is that this book just isn't funny or amusing. I've enjoyed Ellen's show and thought this book might be entertaining, but it's just inane. I bought it at a yard sale for 50 cents, so no monetary loss, but my God, I'll never have the time back that I spent reading this."
5,Best Comedy,This is one of the best comedies I have seen on TV in a very long time. Witty and intelligent so it is no wonder it is rumored to be canceled. If you haven't seen it give it a try!
4,"""My white guy sucks""","I was a fan of this show when it was on the air, although it was uneven episode-to-episode. When it was working, it was very funny. I wish it had been allowed to mature and hit it's stride.HIGHS:- Ted's Boss Veronica (stole every screen)- Scientists: Lem and Phil- Veridian Dynamics 'commercials'- 'Racial Sensitivity' episode (instant classic, worth the price of the DVD alone)I am also a big fan of 'Community' and think it probably would appeal to like minded individuals."
3,"Not bad, but....","DVD and MTM do a passable job in the production of The Gin Game, but what was their greatest asset in the old Dick Van Dyke series becomes their Achilles heel here, namely their strong chemistry as a team. I just couldn't get past the feeling that these people had known each other for decades, and knew each other's every quirk. In this show, that gets in the way of the story line that revolves around two elderly strangers getting to know and dislike one another and go through the process of accepting each other (and themselves) for who they are. It's too bad that they picked this particular project for their long-awaited reunion.I was privileged to see the incomperable Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn in the original stage production of this play. Strangely enough, although they also were a team of VERY long standing, they were able to overcome this issue. I understand that a VHS version of that performance is floating around. I strongly recommend seeing that, if you can."
3,not bad,this game was pretty good and i liked the adventure/mystery but it was short i finished it in one day
2,not so great,"i got this game and i thought it would be really awesome, but it does not work very well. i loaded it and the graphics are very weird. you can barely see where your walking because the grass and sky just fly evry where. i wouldnt get this unless you have a very updated computer."
3,should i buy this game?,"should i buy this game? i'll probably end up getting it since i get every horsie computer game, but i feel like it wont live up to the standerds of champion dreams: first to ride. i really liked saddle up: time to ride...is this just as good??"
4,Comfortable right out of the box.,"Not quite as tapered and stylish as they appear in the photos, but they feel great on my feet. The closure is a convenient, one handed operation. More comfortable than walking shoes of the same brand name."
3,Hunter light fan switch,"this is a pretty flimsy dual switch, but apparently there is no real alternative for the price; it will do, but count on the switch knobs breaking off at some point and having to replace the entire assembly"
1,"Cheaply made, dissappointing for Hunter brand name","The first one I bought had the slider knob break off after less than a years worth of use. Light use at that. The second unit I'm still using, now makes the lights flicker on the ceiling fan. When I turn on the light for the ceiling fan, the switch now makes a buzzing sound and emits a burning electrical smell. Now I'm going to need to replace this one, and find something better. I was told to buy a Hunter switch for a Hunter fan, as they have more powerful motors and need better switches. I guess they can't handle their own brand of switch. Cheap construction, as well as durability. I would not recommend getting this."
1,"Helpful... but definitely not ""complete""...","Okay, so call me picky. When someone calls a book ""complete"" I expect them to at least put a disclaimer somewhere visible that says ""NEARLY complete"". Maybe this book should have been titled ""The Nearly Complete Work-In-Progress Bead Resource Book"".While I realize that stores do come and go in this industry, I have found quite a few stores (six to be exact, and counting) in the San Diego area that are not in this book... wonderful stores with TONS of beads that have been in business many years in the same location... yet... they are not included in the ""The Complete Bead Resource Book"".If you're looking for an all-around general listing of bead resources, it would be way cheaper to search the internet, or your local yellow pages."
5,Lots of Info,I can't imagine a more useful book for any one who buys beads. The information is complete and extensive. Definitely an asset!
3,Distance from Colorado is a factor,This clock worked well for 2 years until there was a solar flare a few weeks ago. We lost the signal and were unable to restore it despite the best efforts of the Customer Service dept. They said that many people on the East coast had a problem because they were so far from source in Colorado. The clock is probably better suited to those living in the West or mid-West.
4,An excellent and accurate time keeper,"After receiving this beautiful and accurate time keeping clock with its large numbers and clean face, I thought that ""manually"" meant that I could adjust it to Hawaiian Time manually. However, this work for awhile until the clock adjusted itself every 12 hours to the closest atomic analog time. For us in Hawaii, it is Pacific Time. Disappointed, I had to return it, but amazon.com gave me my full refund."
3,nice looking but loud tick,"was told it was quiet, but it ticks loudly and can be heard at night called to ask rep if it ticked and he said no"
2,Flawed,"What started with an easy setup has become more and more complicated. Even following the written directions and using new batteries, this clock is 'haunted.' It just doesn't want to work. Quite frustrating as a similar atomic clock I purchased at the same time has been perfect!"
1,The clock did not work,"I bought one and had to return it. The clock did not work properly. After I set it, it worked OK for a couple of days, then the hands fiercely rotated for several circles and ended in a time that had nothing to do with accuracy. It's a bad experience buying this clock, although it did look nice with the wooden frame."
2,Perfectly one minute fast,Great clock but consistently one minute fast and no way to correct. I should have learned from my first experience. I bought 25 La Crosse clocks (different model (WT-3102)) for our church and the second hand in over half of them has now frozen. Although the hour and minute hands keep good time. The one-year warranty had just run out so no response from my email to La Crosse.
2,Dissatisfied,The clock looks very nice but the second hand quit working within the first week I had it. Pretty dissatisfactory in my opinion.
2,antenna,"Packaged well and easy to set up. Antenna is not sensitive enough, so I have a decent quartz clock, not an atomic clock. Ten others in my house and garages are sensitive enough where mounted, including other La Crosse units. Bummer...."
2,"Worked for a while, then NOTHING.","Not at all happy with this product. While it works, it is great. But then, just after the miserly 1 year warranty, it dies. I put in a new battery, and it worked for about a day, then died again. Another new battery, one more day. Thanks, but no thanks. Too bad, it is a great idea and looks good."
4,Nice Clock,"This clock is very attractive and was priced well. It is easy to use as the time is set automatically via radio waves, so it should always show the correct time. I recommend it."
2,Clock went crazy,"I had had this clock for 11 months when it lost its mind. Starting about a week ago, every afternoon the hands would start spinning around. This would go on for a few hours until it finally stopped at the correct time. As of this morning it was still running but the time was wrong by several hours. I guess that the radio receiver must have failed. Very disappointing."
2,malfunctioned after a year,"This clock worked well for about a year. Then it went crazy: it would be slower than the right time by exactly four hours, and then corrected itself; it did that for a few days. I thought it might be the battery. But no. It is now completely dead after I put in a new battery. Very disappointed."
4,Finally...a quiet clock!,"Does your noisy clock drive you to distraction when you are reading, studying or otherwise enjoying quiet time? Then this is the clock for you. I did quite a bit of searching before I decided on this one. I admit I would have like something a bit more stylish but decided in favor of practicality. It is nice looking, easy to read, sets itself automatically, goes with most any decor, and is so quiet you have to be right on top of it to hear the second hand move. Oh yes, and it keeps perfect time. Purchase and delivery time was quick and easy."
4,Quick read on how the Internet is changing Commerce.,This is a great book on how the Internet is changing commerce and the demand for more personal interaction. How will people find their way through millions of web sites? By referral from their friends and family. High Tech/High Touch makes a lot of sense and I think most people will think so also.
5,Azumanga Daioh! DVD 1 by Mew Kiki,"This anime is the funniest I have ever seen in my entire life!!! I laughed soo hard I cried!! It is SOOO hilarious! Although I should definatly say that it's not for everyone. Some of my friends couldn't sit through it or pay attention.(unless your a total anime freak like me) I still watch it over and over like the rest of my anime but no other anime is as funny as this one-trust me it'll knock your socks off!!! Definatily worth the money!! At a sleepover of mine, one of my friends laughed soo hard, and liked it soo much she had to watch it over and over and was wired all night!!! FYI: this anime is for girls. TOTALLY WORTH 5 STARS!!! -Mew Kiki"
3,Only for the die-hard fans,"Here is Alice Faye in her first year in Hollywood and she convincingly portrays a shy girl trying to establish herself as an actress; in fact, exactly what she was at the time. This doesn't mean that the film or Alice are very good. The script is weak, the production values mediocre and the supporting cast, including the tedious comedians Mitchell and Durant, minor so this is a B grade film all round. Alice really only comes alive in the 2 song numbers and she looks and sounds good in both.This apparantly was the last remaining print of this film, thought to be lost, so the quality is not very good too. For die-hard fans, it is better than nothing."
5,QUICK!,"You did an outstanding job getting my family your product and I greatly appreciate your service, thank you and have a nice day."
3,Seems like high quality to me.,"I got this pan with the intention of making sandwich bread. The metal seems higher quality than anything available at Walmart. The surface has a unique texture to it that takes a lite coating of butter very well. I've made several loafs so far in my pan, and they've all came out really nice. The only thing I don't like about this pan is the tapper. The top width is about 4.25"" and the bottom is about 3.25"". Which makes a great looking loaf, but the slices won't fit a square slice of ham and cheese very well."
4,Beautiful!,"These Earrings are just beautiful! You can't really tell from the item photo, but the stones are princess cut, which was a wonderful surprise to me, as I presumed they'd be round.Only down side was that the stems are very long, which makes activities like sleeping in them, or talking on the phone a painful experience. I'll probably see if I can't get the stems cut shorter, because that would make them perfect ;)."
2,Needs more QA During Product Development,We were given this as a gift by our child's aunt and uncle for use when travelling. They had the same model which they had used for a while.The player worked OK. It had very poor balance for use in a car with poor shocks. It would cause the DVDs to skip a lot. It was also difficult to adjust the carrier to fit in various cars we travelled in and almost impossible to hook onto an airplane seat.We lost the remote shortly after getting it so we could not skip any pre-menu ads or navigate the DVD menu options with just the player. Not good at all. At that point we might as well just use our laptop.
3,Excellent performances. And that's all.,"I finally saw this movie for the first time the other day, more than a year after its theatrical release to overwhelming critical acclaim, including a few Academy Awards. But I was very disappointed with it. What I saw was little more than a sappy melodrama, laced with superb acting performances but badly flawed by a hokey and unoriginal script. This movie is so uninspiringly melodramatic and predictable that it could have been made for TV instead of for the big screen. In fact, they make movies just like this one for Lifetime every week."
3,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","This movie was fairly good but not exceptional. The story centers around three childhood friends that are reunited 25 years later when the daughter of one is murdered. Though Sean Penn has proved to be an outstanding actor in other roles, I didn't particularly like him as the father of the murdered girl and wasn't really moved by his performance. Tim Robbins' acting was moving and I thought he was the best part of the movie. Kevin Bacon was also very good as the cop investigating the murder. The supporting cast added little to the movie and the actress that played Sean Penn's wife was irritating to say the least. Even when she wasn't speaking, she was irritating. For a movie to be exceptional, I think the audience has to care about the characters. Most of the characters in this movie aren't very likeable and seem to have few redeeming qualities."
5,Awesome Movie,"This movie was very good in my opinion. Daughter and I decided to start watching it last night around midnight, thinking we would watch the first 30 mins or so and finish it the next day, well that was not an option after it started playing. The movie was full of suspense and took an awesome turn in the end. We both enjoyed it to it's fullest. I would recommend this movie to everyone. But remember, grab the coke and popcorn before you sit down because you will not want to get up till it's over. Enjoy, we did."
2,Extremely disappointing,"A movie starring fine actors such as Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, and directed by Clint Eastwood, should be a can't-miss opportunity. For the first hour and 15 minutes or so, it seems like the movie is going to deliver -- the story is laid out methodically, without plodding, and the acting is superb, even if Mr. Fishburne is criminally under-utilized. Then it all falls apart.I won't give away the plot or the ending, but safe to say what you think you are watching for the first half and hoping to see resolved takes a bizarre and contrived twist, and the resolution is so wholly unsatisfying that you feel cheated for sitting through this two-plus hour film. Great talent, wasted."
4,Mystic River,"This is a great film. Penn highly deserved the Oscar for his performance in this film and the direction and supporting/co cast were all fantastic. It has you gripped until the end and leaves you breathless at it's conclusion. It has some very powerful, highly charged scenes and the whole film is acted brilliantly. It is a film that is better the first time around as you are unaware of the outcome and twists, but can easily be watched and enjoyed again and again. Well worth a viewing.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"A good movie, but not great.","Not as good as I had hoped, based on the buzz. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are excellent. Laurence Fishburne saying ""car"" with a Boston accent is hilarious, and ridiculous. The movie is basically a two-hour cop drama suitable for television except that Penn and Robbins are so good. I must say I am glad I did not buy this one."
5,Dark mood piece,"I liked this riveting but dark movie in which actions of the past play into present deeds.Besides the outstanding acting of Sean Penn the other highlights of this movie are the mood set by the streets of Boston and the haunting music which was composed by the director, Eastwood."
2,"Technically superb, but you walk away disappointed!","The movie is well-acted, well-edited and well-directed. It is, however, extremely dreary and very disappointing at the end. I walked in very eager to see it, but walked out drained and depressed. The message of the film is very dark and pessimistic. There was no closure as victims die and aggressors triumph.When I walked out of the theater, many people behind me were chatting about how much they &#65533;hated&#65533; the movie. I didn&#65533;t hate it. I wanted to like it, but I didn&#65533;t. It truly deserves zero stars, but I gave it 2 for the acting!Do yourself a favor and don&#65533;t see this movie."
4,Thumbs down for music dialogue and filming...........,"Okay, the story is great, the acting is great, but the dialogues are very vague like a sort of ""word-potpourri.""I also didn't like the filming angles. I don't know much about filming but I do know that good camerawork can make or break a movie. I thougt it was rather dull. I also find it very blasé that you see a sort of tunnel of light when Dave gets killed (much too sci-fi for this movie).And don't even get me started about the music! Clint Eastwood should keep himself busy with directing and not with anything he doesn't know anything about. The music was VERY repetative and very bad. It gave the movie a very cheap aura and is not what it deserved. The music reminded me of some cheap B-movie, where some dumb*ss composer sits behind his computer and mixes some flimflams untill he produces a sound diarrhoea.But the story and acting is so good, I'll still give it 4 stars."
3,STORY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE BELIEVABLE BEFORE ADVANCED FORENSICS,"This story had a really great start with excellent performances by Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. Unfortunately during the point in the story where Tim Robbin's character was a prime murder suspect, because there was a large amount of blood in his car made no sense, because with current advanced blood and dna testing, the police could have determined that the blood was not from Sean Penn's daughter. Without giving away too much of the plot there were alot of other elements of this story that just did'nt work in this current decade of internet, phone, dna, blood, and forensics advancements. Perhaps it would have been alot more believable during the late 60's or early 70's."
2,Predictable & Overacted,"I don't understand why critics around the world joined hands in universal praise for this film. I see an enormous amount of films and I usually tend to agree with the majority of critical opinions, but not this time.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are both HORRIBLE in this movie. I'm no actor, but to see Sean Penn in ""anguish"" over his daughter is the most unintentionally funny performance of the year. It looks like he decided to try as hard as he could to be ""dramatic"" and all his lines are spoken with an annoying scowl. Tim Robbins is worse, wandering around looking confused and failing to show us any character beyond Tim Robbins: Actor.Don't even get me started about the ending, lame. I saw it coming an hour away. I love Eastwood, but people are pandering to him too much. I've watched better episodes of network TV drama.Overlit Hollywood crap."
2,2 stars for Clint,"I have great respect for Clint Eastwood as a director but if you already saw Sleepers then you can happily skip this movie. It's dull, slow and Sean Penn does the worst Robert DeNiro imitation I have ever seen."
3,What Rick Tharp said,"I agree with Rick Tharp's review 100%. My wife and I saw Kelley Hunt at the Austin City Limits Music Festival yesterday. She was great and we immediately came home looking to buy an album. Now I have to confess that I haven't listened to this whole album, but from the 30 second clips, I won't buy it. Very flat, just like Rick said. I've ordered her live album, Inspiration, and hope that it better represents what we saw yesterday. I feel bad giving this album only a 3 rating because we really like her, but having seen her live, that's all I can give for this album."
5,The best of the best!,"This was the first techno cd I ever bought, and it still blows everything that has come since out of the water. ""Indo Silver Club"" is the most enjoyable dance song ever made. If you even like dance music a little, you should own this album."
3,"Great Album; Latest Pressing, However...","While this is one of the greatest house/electronic albums to have been released in the 90s, this latest vinyl pressing from Virgin may be problematic. I purchased this vinyl from my local record store last night, and when I first opened it and looked at the vinyl under light it looked a little warped, seeing grooves going across other grooves at parts throughout (on both sides of the A/B side). Then when I played it, there were constant bumps and pops and skips throughout every song. I didn't bother listening to the C/D vinyl, and promptly returned it.When I talked to the employee at the record store, they said they had had the same problem with other people buying the same album. I have a feeling there may have been a large number of defective pressings.Try to get an earlier pressing of this album, or be lucky and buy this one and get a pressing that isn't screwy.Amazing album though."
4,Pretty Good,I love daft punk but this one isn't the best! i'm sorry to some people that think it is don't rag on me or nothing please.But face it it's the 2nd best 'Discovery' is the best there is good songs on it though! Like 'Around The World' and 'Da Funk'.If you are just starting off on daft punk get 'Discovery' and then 'Homework'.
1,Nowhere near the same level as Discovery,"After being a huge fan of the go-to Daft Punk songs such as Harder Better Faster Stronger, Digital Love, and so on, I decided to go back and purchase all the Daft Punk CDs. While I immediately loved both Discovery and Human After All, I found Homework simply grating to my ears and really rough around the edges. It seems Daft Punk really improved with subsequent albums."
4,great adaptation of Collodi's timeless classic,"This version of PINOCCHIO from FAERIE TALE THEATRE is a wonderful adaptation of Carlo Collodi's timeless classic, about a wooden puppet who is brought to life thanks to a lonely man's desire to become a father.Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) plays the title role with Carl Reiner as Geppetto, Pinocchio's loving father. Lainie Kazan is a sassy delight as Sophia, the Blue Fairy who grants the gift of life to Pinocchio, and James Coburn is fantastic as the evil Gypsy. Also in the cast are James Belushi and Michael Richards.One of the best!"
5,This book rocks!,"The first half of this book provides valuable information about breaking into magazine markets. Although the tips are professional and ethical, Diana and Linda are quite funny while talking to us -- and that's the tone of this book. The authors are talking to their readers, not at their readers. I literally laughed out loud several times while reading. The second half of the book consists of samples of successful query letters and comments from the editors who gave the assignments to the writers. This information alone is worth the cost of the book a hundred times over."
2,Wish was instrumental,"Just saw ""The Insider"" directed by Michael Mann. The film ended with an inspired use of ""Safe from Harm"". I immediately bought the soundtrack and was disappointed to learn that ""Safe from Harm"" was not an instrumental. It did say that it was the ""perfecto mix"". Would appreciate any information concerning other mixes of ""Safe from Harm""."
1,MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT,weak undeveloped rhythm tracks and silly lyrics from a musically challenged group
2,You have to be kidding me.,"How can people write that this album stands the test of time? 10 years later, this album is as dull as old chewing gum stuck under a table at your local chip shop. This is the sort of music that I would expect to hear at a Marks & Spencer while buying my granny a new scarf."
5,Great Remaster,"Remastered and on vinyl; a seminal album that wouldn't go astray in anyone's collection, even if you've got the album already."
1,Dead Pixels after 12 months,I had this tv for one year and few days when I noticed dead pixels in an oval shape in the center of the screen. The Toshiba Service reps are horrible and they are refusing to cover this as it is 1 year and 10 days old. I am done with Toshiba products and wouldn't be surprised if this company goes bankrupt because of such bad products and customer service.
3,failed after 3 months - toshiba took another 3 months to replace,honestly the tv itself is fine - but 3 1/2 months to get a panel replaced on a 3 1/2month old tv is a little ridiculous... our local service center (non toshiba) is mostly to blame - with proper nagging thay are finally replacing the tv with a new one (glory glory) but i fear another failure. customer service is an issue. love it while it works though.
5,Hands down the best value!,"I bought this a Nebraska Furniture Mart 4 days ago for $2300 with warranty and tax and I have to say it blew my mind. I'm a gamer and my 360 has never look SO COOL! The colors are amazing and with the 360 hooked up on the HD setting with it's ability ""up-filter"" DVD's... breath taking! I downloaded Batman Begins in HD from Xbox Live and wow!If you've got a game system do yourself a HUGE favor and jump all over this TV. It's the perfect size, not too huge and not to small. And this is coming from a guy that played halo 3 on 36 in sitting like 2-3 ft away from the screen. I can sit back on my couch and relax and still be able to play! It's just that SHARP."
5,Great t.v.!,"Bought display model from Costco. I only have standard digital from directv but this picture is awesome. It is much nicer than our 36 inch flat screen tube sony. The audio is also much better. It is very easy to adjust, plenty of choices for screen size and the colors are outstanding. No glare either from the lamp my husband always has on and which bothered me with the sony tube tv we had. Whenever we decide to get hdtv I will probably fall in love again."
3,"This is ok, but you are bettter off getting the second edition (2002).",This is the first edition (1998). The second edition is now available and contains much more up to date information and references.
2,Buy Vitalogy,"Not For You and Tremor Christ are two of Pearl Jam's more average songs. And you can find them both on Vitalogy, anyway, along with 12 others."
3,cozy doesn't have to mean superficial,"After reading excellent reviews on this book, I was prepared to really enjoy it. Some details of l930s life in Chicago were great - the popular radio shows of the era, coffee brands, types of clothing, even recipes in vogue. The author had clearly done a lot of research. But I thought each character had only a glimmer of humanity; I found them superficial; some were no more than caricatures. The plot was less than believable. I was disappointed in this book and would not read another by this author."
5,Great Product but Smaller Size Than Advertized,This product does an excellent job for what it is designed to do. I inserted one of these into my shredder and I instantly heard the rpm of the cutters speed up. Less friction means longer motor life! No mess; just insert in the direction of the arrows and your done! The only gripe I've got is the fact that the size is only half of what is advertised @ about 8-1/2 x 5-1/2. Although this size is plenty sufficient to do the job.
3,"Shredder Lubricant Sheets, 8-1/2"" x 6""","Works as described. The lubricant is mineral oil, per the Material Safety Data Sheet for this product. Be advised, however, that mineral oil is a petroleum product that has a lower flashpoint (about 400 degrees F) than the canola oil lubricant sold and recommended by a leading U.S. shredder manufacturer. Canola oil has a flashpoint of more than 500 degrees F. Particularly if you work your shredder hard and hot, canola oil might be a safer choice of lubricant. It also won't void your warranty, as will the use of a petroleum product on shredders made by some manufacturers."
3,Hard to tell if it works,When I bought the shredder; I was told I needed the sheets. I can't tell if they make a difference in the operation of the shredder.
5,Shredder Lubricant Sheets- Awesome,The shredder lubricant sheets are awesome! Thank you for offering such wonderful product at such a great price!
5,Universal 38036 Shredder Lubricant Sheets,"A MUST for your personal shredder! Keeps it cutting like it was just taken out of the box! I use two sheets, one all the way to the left, then the other all the way to the right. Make sure you run it backwards after shredding these sheets to lubricate the whole cutting area! The price is a whole lot cheaper than what I bought at my closest Office Max, and there's twice the product!!"
1,More Lies,"This is another example why Nican Tlaca needs to write our own history. You have these white scholars who misinterpret everything about our culture and profiting off of it by perpetuating myth of violent, bloodthirsty savages. What's worse is that our youth is being fed this garbage. Human sacrifice has never been proven and fabricated by the white Spaniards in order to justify rape and genocide the same way the Jews were demonized. THAT'S the truth. We had a very strict penal code, which explains the display of skulls, but no more than the American customs of today. If you come across some bones, automatically it's ''sacrifice.'' That's what that fancy degree got you, right? We're sick of all the lies, racism, and won't stand for it.TELL THE TRUTH!"
4,Excellent continuation,"From the minute I finished the first book I couldn't wait for this one to come out, and it did not disappoint me. The plot moved very well, the characters are very well developed, and the storyline is new and original. Roman does a great job of showing the inner sides of the characters (something you don't always get from the comics). I highly recommend this book. Overall, the trilogy is one of the best X-novels that I have read."
5,Beautifully Written!,This book is not for the weak of heart. Although some parts are inappropriate for young readers. I couldn't put it down. The characters in it are great. They range from a sadistic old man to a sickly niece. Anything but boring; this book is a tribute to vampire lovers everywhere.
2,Mostly tedious,"Got this after hearing and really enjoying Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.Few if any of the other tracks have the richness of that one.For many of them, you have essentially heard the entire track after thefirst 8 beats, or even after the first 4!"
5,Miles Better Than Homework,"I wasn't too great a fan of Homework - I loved the thumping tracks like Revolution 909 and Alive, but I thought that too much of it was just unlistenable grating noises that seemed to follow the simple routine of just getting louder and louder. This is a whole different ballgame, with only Short Circuit sounding remotely like a refugee from their debut. It's more like an up-tempo Air style sound, best showcased on tracks like Digital Love and Veritas Quo. My only criteria is that the last two tracks are a little pedestrian, very average run-of-the-mill house music."
1,What a disappointment...,"This album is a total disappointment... The CD features two good songs, the rest you can throw away... You'd think they could come up with something pretty awesome after a three year break but don't bother with buying this one."
2,Bought it... sold it - Same sound repeated over and over,"I bought this album out of curiosity, after I had heard the opening track, ""One More Time."" That ONE track was awesome, but I was dissapointed to find out that the rest of the album is very, very similar in sound. I think they're beeing overrated. Sorry... I know I might be offending some of their fans, but I really didn't like this work. As I said in the title of the review, I sold it. I give it 2.5 stars."
5,So Good,"I don't know where to classify this album, but damn the genre, this is just fantastic music. I find this record thoroughly enjoyable everytime I put it in. Anyone who needs an album to put them in a good mood has come to the right place. If I was a good dancer, I would cut the rug all night to these tracks. They're just so driving and upbeat you can't help but at least start to nod your head. And the more relaxed songs like Nightvision and Something About Us are smooth as butter. I recommend this album to anyone looking for a good time. Give Discovery a try, it's a very rewarding cd."
5,disco-very,"this was the 1st time i had ever heard french-disco house. its hard to believe this is in the rave scene, but it is. I loved this cd right off the bat! the tunes are fresh and up-beat and it has a good dance cycle that keeps you moving and moving through the whole cd."
1,Played out Techno-Pop,"This album pales in comparison to Daft Punk's quality first release. It's full of played out pop hooks. This is not Techno music, it is... The fact that the title track is now featured on a GAP clothing commercial is testament to the fact that this record if full of mindless pop fodder for the MTV masses. Do yourself a favor and burn your $$$ instead. It'll be more interesting than listening to this album."
3,Computer Love,"Not being familiar with Daft Punk's previous outing, ""Homework"", I had no expectations for ""Discovery"" (or Disco very...get it?). I, like many others I'm sure, have been seduced by the dancefloor joy of ""One More Time"". A four-on-the-floor, vocoder vocaled, disco marvel that is sublime in it's simplicity. The rest of the album journeys through many different styles and influences from Kraftwerk to disco to 1999-era Prince to early 80's breakbeats. It all works though, because obviously these boys have a reverence for the periods. There are not a lot of lyrics (for those of you who prefer words with your music!) and what lyrics are here are 95% of the time sung and/or spoken through a vocoder. But for sheer dance floor madness, it's a keeper. It's a very energetic record (perfect ""getting ready to go out"" listening!) and very well crafted. It can get repetitive, but that's part of the charm. This record was not meant to save the world, it was meant to make us dance...and smile."
4,The Jacket,"Well worth your time to see, a young man (Adrian Brodie) is put through some dangerous and highly questionable therapies by a psycho psychiatrist (Kris Kristofferson). He soon discovers he has the ability to go back and forward in time during the treatments. High recommend."
2,The Strait-Jacket,"This movie is just waaaaay too far out for my tastes. The acting is good, but the subject matter is depressing and weird. Sorry, too weird for me!"
2,"So much talent, wasted","For a while you think you understand, but ultimately it cannot be understood. More's the pity."
4,Creepy,"I saw this movie with a preview audience and it was pretty well received. It starts slowly and takes too much time to build to the main storyline (reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Once Adrien Brody's character starts ""time traveling"" the plot picks up and becomes quite interesting.It is a difficult movie to discribe without giving away too much of the plot. The movie is both creepy and touching. The supporting actors do a good job with their characters; it is hard to tell if they are really evil, or completely misguided.The ending wraps up some of the story, but leaves questions unanswered, and not just the usual conundrums caused by time travel.I like movies that don't answer all the questions, as I want something to think about. This movie provided conversation trying to figure out what other directions the story could have gone. If you are looking for a bloodfest,or lots of violence this movie isn't for you."
2,What the hell is this ???,"I had high hopes for this movie after reading the description and hearing from a friend that I might enjoy it. Boy was she wrong. I must admit that I was pulled into the movie during the first 30 minutes or so, but after that, I lost interest. As I was watching this all I could think was that this was a 4th rate version of Jacobs Ladder, which blows this movie away.And the story-book ending just makes you want to puke.Instead of checking this movie out, go rent or purchase Jacob's Ladder."
3,"Positive, if not uplifting conclusion!","Jack appeared to have died in the gulf War, but then, did he die? He wound up walking along a road in Maine where he met a girl and her mother, but when a cop was killed, did he do it?He was sent to a hospital for the criminally insane. His treatment included being drugged and placed in a mortuary locker in a straight jacket, where he had out-of-body experiences and saw the past, and the future, or did he?This apparently cruel treatment, being locked in a morturary locker, seems to have worked by putting Jack in another dimension, and allowing him to solve otherwise unsolvable problems in his mind.At the end of the movie he was able to lock himself into a future existence through the straight jacket and the locker, but was that real, or was it in his mind, and did it matter?In some odd way, this movie reached a positive, if not uplifting conclusion. It took a while to get there and I'm not all that sure it was worth it."
5,Worth more than 5 Stars,"If you are anyone capable of digging deep into emotion at all, having the intelligence to embrace the sorrow of loss, yet understand the beauty of gaining things beyond the wildest of imaginations? You'll love this movie. This movie tells the story of a soldier returned home, and through the most creative and interesting of experiences meets the love of his life... the irony of the bliss that ensues is extremely well portrayed by Adrian and Keira... amazing!"
2,Not my kind of movie,I got this because Brody was in it but was disappointed. I would never tell someone to watch it.A show that lacks much.
1,Poor translation,"The translation to Storm Riders is terrible. Parts of the book are so bad; you think the translator never took an English class in his life. ""Do people really talk like that?"" The biggest annoyance of the book is the translator can't decide to use the English translation of the characters name or they're actual Chinese names (i.e. Cloud or Bu-Jing-Yun). And if you think it gets better as you progress through the series, you're wrong.(...)Another Note: The art is Awesome!"
1,What SIZE is this gasket?,"Wouldn't it be advisable from a business standpoint to put DIMENSIONS on this gasket?!?!?The original gasket measures 2-3/4"" outside diameter by 1-7/8"" inside diameter.Are there dimensions of ANY of the gaskets sold here?You just lost a sale because this info was not available.While it is very convenient and cost effective to order this gasket online,I cannot order one unless I know the dimensions."
2,Glass cleaner,"The configuration of the item does make it easier to reach difficult spaces, however it did not clean as I expected and required several attempts to get windshields and windows clean and partially streak free."
4,excellent Christmas music,"If you love Billy Dean's voice then this is a must for your holiday collection. Pure Billy, and uplifting for the holidays."
2,"Makes some projects easier, but not really worth the money","I think the extension kit is a good idea, but ultimately having 30 extra needles doesn't allow you to do that many more projects for the money. Adding this to your USM will give you 130 needles which will allow you to knit baby blankets and lapghans without piecing, but most larger projects will still require piecing. I would suggest finding a used second machine to connect the two together to have a super machine."
3,More than adequate,"While most of the stories in Ms. Arielle Ford's book were touching it was not exactly what I expected I always thought soul mate is somebody who is really your other half, someone who fills that void within your heart, that very special person who makes you more whole than you already and with whom you have ties to from past lives and future lives. You share that unbreakable cosmic bond. When you see them there is just divine a spark between you that literally lights up both your worlds and the world becomes a heavenly place. Or then maybe I am just a hopeless romantic.."
4,LIKE GOLD RUSH STORIES? THIS IS FOR YOU!!,"I am really into Gold Rush stories right now. I like the ""true"" aspect mixed in with a fiction story of individuals the best......but an actual diary of someone that was there is great. Good book, read the whole thing in one sitting."
5,Very Good Read,"Being from the Central Illinois area I found this book to be very truthful about the many places and stories of the area. Somethings I did not even know I have since checked on and have since found the stories to be reliable, (as far as the teller is concerned). Be aware though that the book is full of typo's! All in all, this book is a wonderful mix of real true to life history and paranormal happenings. I would not hesitate to recomend this book to anyone."
2,A real dud!,"Not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies, pretzels, strawberries, etc., but it doesn't even warm up the syrup. So, like someone else said, you may as well fill up a bowl with Hershey's syrup and let the kids dip away. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this. They thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate."
3,Messy but fun,We enjoyed it during the chocolate fountain craze. But it was a pain to clean. So it's in the 'give-away' pile.
1,Poor Quality,This product is represented to work well in the wind. The spinning pole is designed to keep the flag from tangling. In reality the wind causes the pole to bend at the spinning connection located at the center of the flag pole. I have had my set in use for about six months and the pole is currently bent at about a 15% angle. In addition the flag is also poor quality. It is already fading.Flags Unlimited is unwilling to correct these problems.
1,"For the most part, this book was awful.","At first, this book was fine. Some of the tips were helpful and meaningful, but after reading several pages I found this book was not serious. Being an overweight person actually looking for helpful ideas, I do not need to be told to ""stand next to fatter people"" so that I may look thinner. Or better yet, ""buy larger furniture so I look smaller."" Some of her ideas were outrageous and down right idiotic. Being a heavy person who needs motivation, I found this book highly offensive and I do not recommend it to those really trying to lose weight."
5,Love this little book,I have this book at work and was pleasantly surprised I could find one. This book was in great shape and was a gift to my college kid.
2,Trying to hard... but nice photos....,"Hmmm... the cover kinda says it all: she is standing in front of a cabinet of ""things"" that have nothing to do with entertaining.This book is a hodge podge of entertaining 101 tips and ""rules of etiquette"" that really don't have a distinctive lifestyle philosophy. It is almost as if the author used google when writing this book: ""Hmmm..okay... let me google 'how to keep flowers fresh' and then I will cut and paste the results into this book.""One of the reasons Martha Stewart is successful is that Martha was a caterer for many many years...threw hundreds of parties..and had a very distinctive philosphy towards living. This woman, won some reality show contest and is now trying to fake her way through this book as an ""expert.""I give it 2 stars because the photography is decent. The content is unoriginal and uninspiring."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Kimberly was a contestant from CBS' Martha wannabe show, Wickedly Perfect. For viewers who watched this show, you'd remember that Kim had this fascination for ribbon roses (she did this as a project twice!). A lot of her ideas are rip offs from Martha Stewart and other genius crafters. She does not have an original bone in her body. Save your money and buy the real thing (Martha Stewart, Sandra Lee, etc)."
5,My favorite cookbook,I have really enjoyed using this cookbook. The recipes are easy to follow and quick. They make great gifts for busy parents who want to make good meals.
3,"Fun, if predictable","This is a well-written, extremely light bit of satire. The ensemble cast live lives comprised of bridge games, golf, and gossip, with very little else to occupy them. After a hundred or so pages, however, I yearned for some excitement not involving who wore what to whose party. Back to the hi-jinks of Wodehouse, I suppose. Incidentally, the other reviews below mine seem to refer to another book, as Lucia does not appear in this one."
5,first-rate satire,"Miss Elizabeth Mapp -- malicious, snooping, miserly and snobbish -- serves as the social center of Tilling, a thinly veiled portrait of the English town of Rye, Sussex, in the 1920s. Determined to maintain her position and to one-up her neighbors, Godiva Plaistow and Susan Poppit, MBE, Miss Mapp resents others' success and devotes hours to planning how to elevate herself. Aside from social-climbing, bridge parties and gardening, Miss Mapp's only other concern is the long-shot scheme of entrapping her neighbor, an Army captain and middle-aged bachelor named Benjamin Flint, into matrimony.Sounds like an outdated bore? In fact, E.F. Benson's biting satire on upper-middle-class pursuits proves hilarious, sort of a more cynical version of a P.G. Wodehouse novel. If you're a fan of M.C. Beaton's Agatha Raisin series or of Julian Fellowes' ""Snobs,"" you'll love all of the books in the Mapp & Lucia series."
5,One of my favorite books,I love the whole Mapp and Lucia series by E.F. Benton. Love it even more in Kindle format.
2,Burned six times before (first two trilogies)! Get this from your library before you buy!,"I'm a huge fan of the original (Frank Herbert) trilogy and unfortunately have purchased the first six prequel books with high hopes that haven't been delivered.Not to detract from this collection of stories, but only a fraction of the book was written by Frank. I enjoyed reading about the mechanics behind the original series and the tribulations endured to make it all happen, but my advice is to check this out from your library before you shell-out hard-earned bucks for a copy.These new prequel series and patchwork history books (by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson) are entertaining as filler leading up to Dune at best, but are destined to be forgotten, and unfortunately detract from the brilliant worlds that Frank Herbert originally imagined.I'm resigned to keep reading, but I think we all should expect better quality from the continuation of this epic series..."
3,only for the fan,"If I weren't such a Dune fanatic, I wouldn't have read this book. Although Brian and Kevin's writing has gotten better over the years, this book is still nothing but a disappointing continuation of a stellar legacy."
1,Worst book in a long time...,"This book was insulting to the profession and to women. Insulting prominent women's health authors with thinly veiled name changes, insulting the women and ""patients"" in her book.As a birth professional I regret buying this book."
5,Reba is wonderful,This is an awesome collection. I have all 4 seasons of the Reba show and they are all worth the money. Plus it is refreshing to be able to watch your favorite show without commercials interupting every 5 minutes.
1,I AM NOT SORRY FOR THE ONE STAR REVIEW,"Having watched this series objectively, instead of subjectively, like I try to watch most of the series offered on the WB channel it is obvious that I for one do not find this series ""hysterical"" or ""palatable"". I find it unedifying, demoralizing and an insult to the human intelligence. This series seems to make it all right for families to be dysfunctional."
1,THIS PROGRAM MISSES THE MARK ALL THE WAY!,"The only reason this program is so popular is because Reba has a huge fan base. The program itself, I find, is very hippocritical and Reba comes off too self-righteous and annoying. Why must she speak her lines in such a patronizing manner?? This show misses the mark for me in every respect but to each his own. DIfferent strokes for different folks."
1,HOW ABOUT DECENCY FOR A CHANGE?,"How about a refreshing throwback to the days when sitcoms didn't throw real-life issues in your faces the way this stupid sitcom does? If you want decency and wholesomeness look elsewhere. You won't find it here. I, for one, am tired of ""realistic"" situations being thrown in my face. I bought the first two seasons of Reba hoping things would change. It has not. It has gotten worse....far worse."
5,Nice well made and works,"Like most of what Uncle Mikes makes, this fills a need and does not cost a lot. It does what it's made to do, and does it very well. For the price it is very nice. It holds up well and works. What more can you ask for."
2,POCKET HOLSTER,"Doesn't fit the gun I ordered it for, very flimsy, and cheaply made, in my opinion. Others may like it fine, I don't."
4,Uncle Mike's Size 3 Inside the Pocket Holster Works Just Fine,"Works just fine for S&W 442 J Frame. It just covers the trigger and only leaves the rear portion of the trigger guard exposed. It does allow for a relatively clean draw from the pocket without the holster coming out of the pocket. Given the warm climate in which I live and the resultant light clothes worn, inside the pants holsters, especially those made in leather, are not very comfortable. I have had no problems with this holster. The only suggestion I could make to Uncle Mike is that perhaps a bit stiffer nylon configuration would improve the non-printing feature of this holster. Given the price, it is definitely a good bang for the buck."
3,Did not fit my LCP with Crimson Trace,"Maybe I'm not use to this type of holster, but it was very difficult to draw my LCP w/CT and not pull the holster out with it.Way to tight with laser grips installed.I'm going to try the DeSantis Superfly next."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWEFUL,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE POCKET HOLSTER AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO FALL APART WITHIN THE WEEK. THE FABRIC OF THE MATERIAL IS FOAMY AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT IS GOING TO LAST A LONG TIME. WHEN I RETURNED THE PRODUCT, LG OUTDOORS DIDN'T RESPOND TO MY PHONE CALLS OR MY EMAILS. THEY SIMPLY TOOK THE PRODUCT BACK AND KEPT MY MONEY. LG OUTDOORS HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. HOWEVER, AMAZON WAS KIND ENOUGH TO REFUND MY MONEY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO DO BUSINESS WITH LG OUTDOORS."
5,Great service,Quick service and well executed. What more can be said about a holster that is made for a particular gun.
2,Much better books for twins are out there!,"I have read several twin pregnancy books, and this one is the least informative by far. The author focuses on her own pregnancy, while putting a little too much emphasis on her opinion that almost all twin pregnancies result in preterm labor and time spent in the NICU for the babies. Though there is a greater risk of preterm issues, they shouldn't be the focus. I just recommend other twin books and there are GREAT ones out there!"
5,The Monkey ~,"This guy is the joy of all who sees him ! I took him to work and turned him on - everybody laughed...and when he is not out on my desk - people say ""where's the monkey?"" !!"
1,not hd ready,who is selling this t.v & they should say it's not h.d. ready--- i liked the picture & sound quality but what good is that if it's not h.d. ready? u r stuck when everyone changes over in feb.09
2,a confusing read,"Ferber's book is a confusing read for anybody approaching the subject for the first time. He attempts to categorise multiagent systems, but many of his key terms are vague. Theaccumulation of distinctions without overall purpose becomesirritating. Despite all the classification, there is no clear overall taxonomy and no hard code. Organisation is poor. A clear taxonomy and a detailed study of an implementation for each category plus code would have made a much better book. There is useful stuff here, but finding it is like looking for matching socks in a laundry bin."
1,"Good for some, but not most.","I appreciate mathematical rigor insofar as it serves as a deterrent to sloppy reasoning, but I think this book represents a case of the author focusing on the mathematics to the point of obscuring its physical significance. Maybe I owe it to my relative ignorance of differenial geometric concepts, but I found this book practically worthless to my understanding of dynamical systems. I tend to agree with David Griffiths when he states that mathematics is a tool to the physicist; this text makes it the sole focus."
4,A book on courtesy,"What an interesting little book. I picked up this book at a library sale simply because it had an interesting title and it was only $1. Well, I read it, in about half an hour (really short and large font) and I was strangely surprise. The book is basically a book on common courtesy and showing gratitude. The author, through a series of vignettes, explores the reactions and responses of several people when they are presented with a gift or simply a nice gesture.Although old, the book's main idea should still resonate with us. It is basically about common courtesy and showing it. It is about showing the other person that we appreciate what they did for us. Very interesting and still relevant."
1,"Tablets stick together, and its not vegetarian!","Horrible purchase. The tablets all stick together inside the bottle, and I realized today that it is not vegetarian, which is not mentioned in the product description on Amazon. I feel cheated, and regret not reading the label sooner."
1,do not buy,"Look at the picture closely. Can you see how the pins wrap and go straight back to 25 deg bend before disappearing inside?? This will ensure you have little or no connectivity. A co-worker purchased these and swore by them. After two hours of retipping, arguing, and overall hillarity to any bystandard- we used a different peanut. Yes we even repunched this one. This was a 30% failure rate in about 18 drops and we're not hourly thank g.., or we'd be fired."
4,"bright,nice quality.but need to drill holes in front sight....",I received these thinking this sight set would be just a drop in upgrade.The front sight blade was a perfect fit but the new sight blade DOES NOT have holes for the roll pins.You must drill them and it is almost certain that a drill press is necessary or risk ruining the guns sight ramp/slide. Otherwise check your local gun sales shop and ask around about a qualified gunsmith. There is usually an experienced gunsmith that can do the job for you at a reasonable price.I am very satisfied. The sights are bright and crisp. Nice quality.I would recommend the Meprolight sights.*gave a 4 rating due to the lack of info on the drilling of the front sight blade.
2,The Shivers,"Arguably one of the worst of the Faerie Tale Theatre series by Shelly Duvall. I don't see why People are saying this one is scary? this is far from scary. It would be laughable, but it's just to boring. It moves slow, and doesn't really do anything until it's already half way through the flick or more. I like to collect this series so regardless I am happy I got this one. I just got this one quicker than I should of based on certain reviews about it. I should have considered another faerie tale before getting this one. I have it now, had to get it sooner or later anyway I suppose."
4,Informative book about Family/Community Craft in England.,"One of my personal favorites, this book is easy to read and full of homespun information. Howevre the information does need to be sifted through, as it appears Ryall has blended some modern Neo-Paganism in with her Family training in this book.Good points: Easy to read, yet informative at many levels, provides a viewpoint not often found in many books on Wicca.Negative points: Needs to be looked at with a close eye to discern what is the older craft and what is newer additions, may bore advanced audiences who are familiar with British Craft practices."
1,The book was unfocused on its topic.,"I bought the book hoping to gain some added insight on how to preserve the game I love, but Joe would meander off on topics comparing The Big Red Machine to the Yankees and letting us know things he thought managers did wrong in last year's post season.50% of the book was a good read, but it wasn't why I bought it. Consequently I was disappointed in what Joe did with such an important topic."
4,Lots of Food for Thought,"Joe Morgan is a thoughtful and intelligent commentator on baseball. It's apparent in his work for ESPN and, now, in his most recent book. While I do not agree with some of his views, i.e., his high opinion of Bud Selig or his touting of revenue sharing as the solution to all of baseball's economic woes, he argues his points thoroughly and rationally, unlike many so-called sports ""authorities."" My only reservation about the book comes from the fact that, as a former player,he tends to exonerate players and their union from any culpability in the game's current environment. However, his commentary on his former teammate, Pete Rose, should be mandatory reading for those with short memories about Rose's actions."
2,eh? not truly awful I guess,"This perenianl discount dollar bin disc has one great song ""Thank for the Angst"" which rocks, but the title is as clever as the lyrics get. The rest of the album is in no way memorable, not memorable good or memorably awful. You can listen to this album and 5 minutes later, recall none of the songs except for ""Thanks"". I remember seeing this in the discount bin and dollar stores for years before I broke down and wasted a dollar on this too late for the hair metal party, wanna be posers. I guess the band still plays in L.A. from time to time, surely not with all original members. When will we see the 20th anniversary edition...distributed in the dollar bin of course?"
5,Excellent,My granddaughters absolutely love this movie. It is now one of their favorites. They love the Bratz collection of DVDs.
2,"Great show content, quality of video is poor",Love the show. The quality of the video is pretty poor and the audio and video are not timed quite right. Pretty annoying to watch and have the sound be 1 second ahead of the video. Tried resetting the show and even watched it on another computer with the same result.
1,"""0"" Stars","Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with ""unfunny"".It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way. Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on."
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY,This is my favorite show!!!! You have to buy at least the first season...you will be hooked!!! I can watch the episodes repeatedly and laugh just as much as I did the first time I watched!!!
2,Season one big bang theory,I watched the whole season. Videos would suddenly stop and restart at a different place. I could not find it for free which would have been preferable.
4,"Would Be a 5 Star rating, but extras too thin","If you enjoy the Big Bang theory, you'll love having the entire first season. The only disappointment was that the ""extras"" left A LOT to be desired.. .no blooper reel? Really? Looked forward to a little more from the extras, but the show is fantastic."
2,"Love the show, but so tired of receiving scratched discs!!","Big Bang Theory, wonderful and funny. Quality of the blu ray however, terrible! I opened it up and put the first disc on, first of all, it was covered in smudges. I wiped clean, and it skipped through out 3 of the episodes. Total bummer. Just such a PAIN to return :("
2,streaming is hit or miss.,"I was forced to watch half of the episodes in poor quality SD. This is not fault of my internet provider as I receive around 20mbps at all times. Also, none of the other streaming services have any trouble (like Netfix and VUDU) as I receive full HD from both without any issues. There is definitely something wrong with the Amazon Instant PS3 interface.Aside from that, the show is great."
4,Entertaining,I recently have just gotten into watching the series of the Big Bang and I love it! It's one of those series you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. I can't wait until Season 2 comes out!
1,Labored through 3 episodes,"After recommendations from several trusted friends, I forced myself to watch more than the first episode. First: fake laugh tracks are a real turn off. Being told when to laugh (especially when the situation is not funny) is pathetic. Second: this show is a predictable collection of worn-out stereotypes with no character depth whatsoever. A hot blond bimbo and nerdy scientists? Please! How about a hot blond scientist and nerdy waiter folks? That would be more interesting. Waste of money if you like stimulating shows like Weeds or Breaking Bad."
5,Just love this TV Series,Did not have any problems with the DVD - I would highly recomment this TV show and series. It's nice to be able to watch the episodes without commercial interruption.
4,This show is a Big Bang of laughs,"Although some will tear this show apart with little reason... This is a fun and light show... I would have liked it better without the edited electronic laughs pumped in .. But for the most part its one of my favorite shows to unwind with a beer after to work... Then off to Zane Lamprey and the wonderful world of drinking with FLN's "" Three Sheets...! """
1,Ruined by laugh track,"The comedy was ruined by the laugh track. Several times a minute, absurdly fake laughter and applause would be clumsily mixed in, then abrubtly faded out. The comedy might have had some interesting scenes without it; with it, the show is just annoying.Does anyone know what would possess a producer or director intentionally to ruin his own work like this? Even if they did like laugh tracks (does anyone?) this was one was incompetent to the point of parody."
1,"makes ""just shoot me"" look good","this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired."
5,Highly Satisfied,"Even though it warned that I may not get my product for a while, I was emailed a few days later and got my packages WAY faster than predicted. Arrived in fairly secure packaging and is in great condition. Will definitely buy here again"
1,Smart people aren't that dumb,"If morons made a show about smart people, they'd call it the Big Bang. Not smart, not funny. Hopefully, it gets better."
4,pretty good dvd set,i have to say first i love this show. i was somewhat disappointed with the picture quality of the first few episodes. they seemed to be a little grainy but after the first few episodes the picture seemed to get better or i just got used to it. i would recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of the show. some of the smartest writing of any sitcom on tv. i hope there are many seasons to come.
5,Love it!,Love them. They're a riot. Whoever would guess that geeky smart nerds could be so funny? We're watching them at work on our lunch hour. A great way to break up the day.
5,Bazinga!,This show is the funniest thing I have seen since Will & Grace!My DVD case was crack in the lower corner but it didn't damage the DVD so I am ok with that!
5,Excellent quality .. I love this show!,"This show is one of the best I have seen in my live..well, if you are or were a graduate student (or just college)..this is for you, hehe...just sit, watch and enjoy"
3,Unfair Advantage could use more advantage,"This is a very basic book. As i read it I kept wishing there was more depth to the information. It is superficial and left this reader frustrated that she had once again paid for a guru's packaging and not content. In typical gufu fashion, the book is oversized and has LOTS of white space. If he is such as expert, why could he not share a little more knowledge with the reader, or is the rest of it in his several-thousand-dollar workshop package?"
5,Start learning NLP NOW!,"After reading a couple of 'text' books on NLP, I found myself swimming in the information I read. There was so much information that I did not even have a place to begin. This book, however, was very simple to follow and, more importantly, implement. After reading this book and using only a few of the ideas that it contains, I probably have gotten as many call-backs in the last 2 weeks as I have in the previous 2 years of my selling career. Many of these call-backs were from voicemail messages that I left, and the people were much more pleasant to deal with than I have ever seen.Anyway, I am very impressed with the book and my eyes are now open to NLP. I can actually start to use this stuff now! I'd recommend it to everyone, but I don't want too much competition!"
2,nothing new here,"I bought this book recently but after reading the first few pages I realized that there is nothing new in this book. The same old stuff from ""the structure of magic (1975)"" by Richard Bandler rehashed.I have lost courage to read it until the end but so far my impression is that this book will not benifit a web marketer because the whole methods rely on constant interactive input from your customers.In all not much fun, but I'm still giving it two stars because the page formatting and printing is superior than most other books."
3,"Cheap, but adequate.","As I was only going to be out 6 days, and didn't have the money to spend on a true ultralight backpacker's tent, I thought this would suffice.For the most part, it did, though on night 4 I split a pole. Luckily, with some duck tape I managed to get through the trip, but this tent will be promptly replaced by something higher quality.This tent was fine for a short trip and a ""one-time-use"" type situation. If you are going to be using this tent a lot, I suggest searching for one of higher quality. That said, for a $30 lightweight tent, it sufficed for my 1 week hike."
1,No Ideas...The other reviewers must be friends of the authors! I wish half a star was an option.,"This book offers no marketing tactics. It stresses honesty and friends. THANKS GUYS...That helps. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY! I can sum up the entire book in this next two sentences. ""Our real marketing thoughts will be in our next book. This book is basically a teaser (like a movie preview), with no information and an exciting title."""
5,Great Knife....Great deal!,Cooks Illustrated gave this knife a great rating against several other pricier models. I thought I'd give it a try since it was fairly inexpensive and am very glad I did. This knife makes prep work a pleasure.
4,Haynes Repair Manual for 1974 - 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass,"This Book was exactly what I was looking for - living in Thailand, it was impossible to get here.But of course Amazon works and the delivery took a bit over one week! Amazing!"
4,let's see more of these two.,"I read the Hawk and Fisher books before I ever knew ""Blue Moon Rising"" existed, I found it in a used book store and felt like I struck gold. These books are witty, fun, well written, and thouroughly enjoyable, (and it must be said that bad guys getting thier just deserts is always a good thing even if it is just fiction.) Beyond the Blue Moon was not quite as good as Blue Moon Rising, but that's rather like saying that a T-bone isn't as good as a ribeye steak. I think Mr. Green has lots of room to work with Hawk and Fisher, I don't see those two settled down on a little backwater farmstead raising kids and chickens."
4,Good information,"Most literature showing the greatness of capitalism through statistics is horribly biased, but this book keeps the bias to a moderate level. This means you get a wealth of statistical information that is not overly influenced by ideology, which is a rare find."
5,If only we had known then . . .,"I remember the day that I met these guys. My best friend at the time, Jeff, introduced me to them and we became very close friends. More than once I remember hearing the very first playing (rehearsals in the curtain shop) of new songs that Phester had just penned. I was a devout friend and follower of theirs for most of the time they were making their way to stardom, and thru the muck and torture of recording and marketing a single (Sit on my face, Stevie Nicks).Nigel Nitro once gave me a cassette tape of the garage practice recordings. I'm not even sure if I still have it or not. It's probably worth a few pennies by now. Not that I would want to sell it.If any members of the Rotters remembers ""Blockhead"" or Harry Carry, I sure miss those days guys.from somewhere in Mid-Missouri"
2,Kindle Edition is terrible,"I am a huge fan of Terry Brooks and the story line for Druid of Shannarra is wonderful. I would give the book 5 stars. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is a terrible version. It is full of errors; punctuation, spelling, grammatical. It was very, very distracting."
2,"Good book, terrible e-book","I have read about a dozen books for the Kindle - all purchased from Amazon. This is by far, the worst e-book I have read. The scan used to create the books is fully of typos - often more than one per ""page"", including errors with main character names and letter combinations that are not even words. I found the problems very disturbing and annoying. E-books are cheaper for a reason - they should not lack the basic proof-reading that you would expect from a 7th grader."
5,The half-mark of an amazing history,"This books gives depth to the lurky areas of the Four Land's past, down to the beginnning of time itself. I for one, enjoyed it thoroughly. It is defiantly a good continuation book and keeps you constantly thinking of when the dark Pe Ell is going to do, what will happen to Quickening, and how it is going to all end. You will find yourself feeling the heart break or sorrow of a character to the hope of another. But most of all, it leaves you thinking: ""Now what?"" at the end. You also will feel somewhat prideful of the heros but you have to read the Talismans of Shannara to find out how it all ends"
4,GOOD MUSIC,"I LISTEN TO THIS CD EVERYDAY THATS HOW GOOD IT IS.I GUARENTEE YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DO. I'M A THIRTY YR OLD YOUNG WOMEN WHO BEFORE THIS CD NEVER LISTEN TO THE BLUES,BUT THIS CD WILL DEFINETLY CHANGE EVERY WAY YOU THINK ABOUT THE ""BLUES"" SO GO OUT FOR XMAS, BIRTHDAY'S OR FOR ANY OCCASSION.WHO EVER YOU GET THIS FOR, WILL DEFINETLY LOVE YOU FOR IT. SO GO OUT AND TREAT YOURSELF ARE SOMEONE ELSE TO SOME GREAT MUSIC...."
5,MotoGP Review,"I like having the entire season on one disc; but I just wish they showed all of the races in their entirety, and not just the highlights."
5,MOTO GP 08 Review,Must have video of the year if you are a motorcycle racing fan. Great editing and few unimportant footage.
2,Really Terrible Stuff,"Lawton's debut novel is a dud. The writing style is stilted, dry, and forced. The characters are two-dimensional, and the plot is boring and tainted with anti-American sentiment. Many times during my reading of this book, I almost put it down--but because I didn't have another book on hand, I kept forcing myself on.Our hero, Sgt Troy, sleeps with two female characters (essentially the only women in the book) while doing precious little detective work. He somehow manages to solve the entire case while getting bombed and shot a few times. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. This is such a poor effort!"
4,I like it,"I work in a call center, which means I talk on the phone all day long (incoming calls only, I don't call!). Those days when the throat just gets really really tight, and you're sure that any minute you're going to open your mouth and nothing will come out, I pull out the Vocal Eze and it really loosens things up. Fortunately I don't need it all that often because it is expensive and not very tasty, which is why I only give 4 stars. I've recommended it to friends, and told the local guitar store they should advertise it in call centers, too. Loaned it to a co-worker who lost his voice, and he went out and got his own bottle the very next day. I recommend it to anyone that needs to use their voice constantly, even if it's not for singing!"
5,A road that everyone will want to travel!!!,"My cousin wrote this book. The Closer's Song brings back many memories from my childhood. All the ranges of emotions were captured from the best of times to the worst of times. Everyone I have asked to read The Closer's Song have all been in agreement that the way Christopher crafted this book lent itself to be a common blueprint of everyone's growing up. Christopher recognized that there was a need for all of us to take a deep breath and take a long, hard look at where we have been to appreciate what we have today. I am happy that The Closer's Song not only tells stories of glory that hit our hearts but relates the tragedy of life that touches our souls."
1,Is this the same person who wrote Fried Green Tomatoes?,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, as I've enjoyed everything else Fannie Flagg has written. Now I can't wait to be done with it... I can't believe all of these 5 Star reviews - am I reading the same book as everyone else here? I keep waiting for something or someone in the book to capture my interest, but nothing has in over 300 pages and I'm beginning to think it won't. The characters are flat and undeveloped - I can't picture any of them in my mind. The dialog is deadly dull, and nothing of interest ever really happens. There are some historical inaccuracies here, as others have pointed out - it really does bug me when she refers to the Gateway Arch in scenes from the 40s & 50s. I sure hope she doesn't do a sequel to this..."
1,"Ugh. Not Fannie Flagg's best, tiresome and superficial.","I have read all of Fannie Flagg's books, and I was really looking forward to this one. Well, it was a struggle from beginning to end. If you've never read Fannie Flagg, don't start with this one. It starts with a gushing, cloyingly sweet description of life in the 50's, and then follows the lives of her many, interesting characters into the 90's without ever fully developing them. I still don't see the point of this book, except as an exercise in over-romanticized nostalgia for an America that never was. It completely overlooks the civil rights era. In some points, it's downright preachy. And in comparison to these supposed ""good old days"", it descends into a barely sketched out indictment of the meaninglessness of life today. Blech."
3,"Great concept, weak development","Fannie Flagg does an excellent job of taking characters from decade to decade, and doing it realistically. That said, there is very little conflict until towards the end, except for Betty Raye's arc. She also spends two decades on a family, only to have them fade to the background. While in some ways this is telling of how time and life work (people drift in and out of your world), in other ways it was jarring. I wanted to see more of them.I would definitely recommend it as a beach read, but it's not as deep as it wants to be."
1,Pretty awful,"I found that the characters personalities were all the same. It seemed that Fannie was looking back through rose colored cataracts. If this was her first novel, she would have had trouble getting it published. There are so many good books out there, this just isn't one of them"
5,Made me long for a simpler time,"I loved this book. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and pleasant to read. I was born in the 60's but this book made me wish I could have lived in this happy, safe, quiet town. It is a feel good book and it doesn't have any car chases or weird twists in the end - thank goodness! I highly recommend it."
5,tea kettle,"very pretty sorry that it can't be used on an induction cook top It didn,t say anything about not being able to use this in this matter."
5,Total Control: High Performance Street Riding Techniques,I find this book very informative. I think this should be required reading for every motorcyclist regardless of skill level. I have been riding a few years and I try to shorten my learning curve by practicing and incorperating proper techniques. This book really broke down the techniques chapter by chapter. Great book
3,"Good, but long","I love Hitchcock and I think Cary Grant is great. I also think this movie was rather slow. They could have either added more to the plot or cut the movie in half. I found myself watching the clock. If your're new to Hitchcock, you might want to pick something else first, like Psycho."
5,Fireworks!,"What was the greatest kiss ever committed to the silver screen? For me it comes from the Alfred Hitchcock thriller, To Catch a Thief. Grace Kelly tempts Cary Grant, a reformed jewel thief by the name of John Robie, with her diamond necklace, to a backdrop of fireworks over the French Riviera. Finally, having had just about enough of her tomfoolery, he says, ""You know as well as I do, this necklace is imitation."" To which, the stunning Kelly responds, ""Well I'm not...""That is movie magic and so is this wonderful, light-hearted and thrilling romp across the south of France as everyone goes in search of the identity of a new jewel thief reeking havoc throughout hotels on the French Riviera.Lush cinematography, beautiful costumes, breathtaking vistas, and delightful performances by Kelly, Grant, and Jessie Royce Landis make this an extremely enjoyable film outing."
5,Fantastic,"I was amazed at how sharp and colorful the picture is on this edition, better than some bluerays out there. In fact, after just buying Kellys Heroes on blueray and being very disappointed in the picture quality, I will look more closely before buying blueray and consider dvds remastered in high def. Also this is a great movie, in a series of great movies Hitchcock made in the 50's beginning with Dial M For Murder and ending,imo, with North By Northwest. This movie is much lighter than the rest, and while some dislike it for that reason, that's why it's a favorite to me."
5,To Catch a Thief,"This is one of the Classic Movies. We had this movie on Cassette Tape but wanted it on DVD also. Over the years, we have watched this movie many times along with North by Northwest. I highly recommend this movie."
4,In the time of the gentleman thief,Take a French Riviera retired semi-Robin Hood type jewel thief (Cary Grant). Take a young American heiress on the loose looking for that one good man that her crowd doesn't provide (Grace Kelly). Take an unknown cat thief who is using all of the Cary's old tricks to loot the rich and famous. Put that plot in the hands of Alfred Hitchcock and you have the basis for a sophisticated suspense thriller a la the 1950's. Cary must defend his honor and retire that new thief on the block. Right? A little romance and other high jinxes along the way move the film along but in the end you know justice (and love) will be served.
4,To Catch a Thief,A very good film staring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Cary plays the part of a retired jewel thief. Someone begins to steal jewels and the local police think its Cary. Grace plays the part of the daughter of a rich Amrican widow. The film then covers how Cary Grants finds the people who have copied his MO.A fun romp through the French country side. Well acted and directed. A must see if you are a Cary Grant or Grace Kelly fan.james
2,A Long Wait for Disappointment,"I had been waiting a long time for the DVD release of this classic romantic mystery. What I had been most anticipating was viewing the delicious technicolor cinematography which garnered an Academy Award for Robert Burks. What a disappointment! The picture quality is grainy and the colors are somewhat washed out. This I could see on the late, late movie on my local T.V. station. So, if you just want to enjoy the story and the entertaining performances by Grant and Kelly, go ahead and buy it. However, if you were looking forward to the beautiful visuals, save your money."
3,Not one of Hitchcock's best,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Hitchcock fan and I like Grace Kelly and Cary Grant. But somehow the mystery in the film didn't intrigue me and I found lots of it boring and pretentious. Not that it's a complete waste. Grace Kelly is as always lovely to look at, and the French riviera is stunning. But the story and acting certainly don't linger in the mind. I give it 3 stars for the leads and scenery. One last observation: it is chilling to see Kelly driving the same winding roads in Monaco where she would meet her death years later."
3,"Much less than it could, should have been.","The movie is an evergreen; Hitchcock with less twist and more romance.The DVD, that's something else. Sound quality is so - so; but the pix, that's worse. Not shown in the theatrical 2.35:1 Cinemascope format, such is never more evident than in the Hitchcock trademark scene ! The one early in the film on the bus when the camera pans left-to-right from the lady with the bird in the cage, past Cary Grant/John Roby to one-half (!) of Hitch sitting next to Roby. The pan'n-scan 4:3 version at least gets all of Hitchcock's dead pan on the screen.With so many lesser works getting better technical treatment, it is disappointing that the publisher didn't make a better effort; guess they cried all the way to the bank !"
5,Professionals best friend,What can I say about a Product that speaks for itself. Excellent communications cellular phone. This small with no frills phone willserve all of your daily needs. For the price you will not find a bettercellular phone.
4,Step by photographic step.,"This publication is another very helpful edition in the pursuit of excellence for the worker in clay. A concise photo by photo demonstration of hand-building the human body in clay, from armature to finished product."
4,Excellent Camera with most ordinary accessories,Kodak EasyShare Z710 is really very good product at this cost.But I must say the other accessories are not standard.For exampleThe tripod should be little more good quality.The battery changer should be 110 to 240 volt range. So that thiscan be use at any side of the world.It would be good if you take care of these items in next release.
2,Why Bother?,"The Age of Wire and String by Ben Marcus is a contained work of ramblings for someone who is clearly trying to be smarter then the room by listlessly spouting out page after page of nonsensical nothingness. Before purchasing this book I read reviews praising Marcus' style and non-linear story telling but I fail to see any story being told at any point in this book. I'm sure Marcus has a solid grasp of the English language as his constant use of interlocking wordplay indicates, but he could use it to such greater degrees and actually accomplish some form of a goal with his work.This work has served me one purpose which is why I did not rate it one star. It has put me to sleep a number of times after a long day of work, and for that I am appreciative."
1,Artistic garbage given form (I'd give 0 stars if I could),"Truely this has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. While i'm sure the gender references would have been interesting and insightful if it wasn't for the fact that a good explanation reveals itself. The main characters where poorly written but that could excusably be called a blessing to mask the fact that the settings where rather abstract. However, I understand that there is a book before this in the series. Perhaps if you had read that beforehand you might not come away so disgusted by this book. If I ever see anyone buy this book i'll slap em' on the wrists and tell them ""I'm sorry, you want a book written by someone good"""
5,Fun viewing!,I love the whole team - Doris was a terrific addition to the cast. Just an enjoyable entertainment!
3,An episode guide to the TV show,"This official guide is more of an episode guide for the TV program than the Beyblade toys. It would be more enjoyable for a fan of the show.We were hoping for more information and tips about the tops, but this was a very small section of the book. It did not hold my son's interest. I would not recommend it for a Beyblade competitor, use the money to buy a Beyblade."
5,Bayblade handbook,"I bought this for a gift as a secret santa, so can't give a review on the book itself, but was very pleased with the service and timeliness in receiving the product."
2,Poorly designed,We bought this for our son knowing he would love the spiral design. Come to find out the tracks do not sit in the plastic stantions very well at all. We even bought the sure track and then the track would not sit on the playboard. They lift off the board and causes the trains to fall off. The design is so poorly made that once we finally got all of it put together the train could not fit down the lower part of the spiral ramp. It would get stuck under the top track. We are taking this back to the store and hope our son will not be too disappointed.
2,"Great set, just don't touch it.","Great wood quality, but it's so flimsy it's hard to enjoy. One wrong touch to the track that's part of the spiral, and it creates a domino effect; all of the track comes apart. Hardly fun for my 5 and 2 year olds, they continually need me to come over and fix the track. In addition, the spaces they leave for your hand to actually push the train THROUGH the spiral is VERY small. Even the littlest of hands get stuck, and knock everything down.Save your money and buy one that only has short bridges, and where most of the track is flat."
2,Just Ok,"This series is kinda lame because it doesn't really teach things, it shows u something like 2 times and says practice"
5,Great book...got it right away too!,"This book is amazing and the person who sent it to me was quick. I appreciate that! This book is straight to the point and very blunt. I will be using it for my youth group and even though some teens might not experience all these topics, they may know someone who does and this book will encourage them to help hat one person going through one of these topics and help them do it in a Christ like manner."
1,An inventive novel,An imaginative work of fiction--guaranteed to cater to the tastes of Usenet conspiracy buffs and the politically dispossessed.
2,An interesting work of fiction.,"This book has been heavily touted on Usenet as a novel, which, as everyone knows, is a work of fiction. It's really easy to see why."
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars!,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The editor of this book must have found it as hard to read as I did for they did a very poor job. That can not be blamed on Taylor but I am afraid that the rest of this mess is his fault.Taylor makes an attempt to write about both history and ghosts and in that attempt he falls short on both counts. His history is poorly researched and in some cases has no basis in fact. He spends so much time on the history of the haunted location that the ghosts themsleves get very little attention. To finish off any hope this work might have had Taylor writes in the same dry style of the people who brought us the high school history books that have led so many people to hate history.Anyone who buys this book to read about history will be so thrown off by the historical errors that they will be able to give the ghost stories little credit. Anyone who buys this book for the ghost stories will just fall quickly to sleep.
4,An excellent introductory Jaguar book.,"You'd think that an introduction to the world of Jaguar had been done enough already. And, indeed, it seems that each passing addition to the collection adds less and less new material on the subject. Nevertheless, this volume has done a wonderful job as a concise collection of basic facts. The tables, in particular, are an excellent resource. As is typical, this book is written with a decidedly British slant but also provides ample information for the American enthusiast"
3,footbed not the same as the same size Birkenstock sandal,"The ridges that Birkenstocks have under the toe joint are in the wrong place in these shoes. The length was correct but the ridges were painful because they hit under my toes instead at the joint. Birkenstock sandals of the same size fit great, but these are different."
4,"Husband loves ""Man Bag""","I bought this leather ""Man Bag"" for my husband as an anniversary gift. He needed something that could allow him to carry his wallet, glasses, cell phone, check book, etc. This ""Man Bag"" does just that and it isn't obtrusive. The only thing I would change about the product, would be to have a thicker strap on it."
1,Barf,"I work as a children's librarian and this book is generally panned by the kids and adults alike. The pictures are not that interesting, the ditties are not clever, and the author seems to enjoy pounding the message of this book with sledgehammer-like force on the readers.The only time it was read aloud was at a story time for at-risk children and it was received with derogatory commentary -- much of it on-target."
4,A touching film,"I first saw this film many years ago as part of the PBS Wonderworks television series for children. While I recognized at the time that parts of the film were a little corny or even manipulative, I recognized a certain heart and earnestness in the film. Briefly, this is a film about a young orphan is goes to live with her aunt when her parents are killed in an accident. At first, the girl is bitter and remorseful, but we begin to see a change in her as she begins to explore her new home and environs. One day, she adopts an orphan baby seal, and in caring for it, begins her metamorphosis for the better. I find that in many ways, this film is similar in theme and feel to Anna Paquin's ""Fly Away Home."" If you enjoyed that film, then you will enjoy ""Seal Morning"" as well. It is a great film for the family and is quite touching. I recommend it!"
2,Mediocre LCD,"Bought it elsewhere because there was a discount. I can't explain exactly why the colors produced were unsatisfying to me, but the most probably reason is that the brownish colors looked very dull in the ""native"" mode. After changing the color mode to ""warm,"" the color of brown was fine, but then I don't have the true grey color anymore because everything looks reddish.But the most disappointing is the ripple. I can't live with an LCD with noticeable ripples.Furthermore, I found 1 dead pixel on this new monitor, so bye-bye, R19PS."
4,Good replacement but semi-permanent only,"I have 2 Honeywell 50100 air purifiers and bought 2 of these as replacement HEPA filter for the originals. The HRF-11 is the new ""permanent"" replacement filter and is a good choice.However, I rated this 4-star only despite fitting nicely in the 50100. The product's statement of ""permanent"" is misleading, though you can clean the filter twice a year with a vacum cleaner, the manual still recommends that you replace the filter every 3 to 5 years under normal usage.I think KAZ (who licenses the Honeywell brand from Honeywell) is simply asking to be sued for labeling a product like this. I'll use the words ""extended life"" if I were them to avoid law suits.Other than that, its a great product and is cheaper than those throw-away type filters."
3,cat comb,"even though this comb works wonders, you have to be gentle so you dont scratch your cat. actually, my cat does not like being combed with it!"
5,my magic socks,"I AM FROM SHANGHAI,CHINA, AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WIGWAM SOCKS, SO I BOUGHT A PACK OF 3 PAIRS, THEN THEY CROSSED THE OCEAN TO COME TO CHINA,THE TRAVEL COST 20 DAYS. WHAT IS WIGWAM? MAGIC SOCKS!"
1,wrong size!,The large says 9 - 12. Amazon send me 12 - 15. This socks are for giants. I hope Amazon will fix this problem.
3,So warm..,"Wished it was softer, but very sturdy..and hole free after many washings..fit comfortable. I wear them in the winter to keep me toasty."
3,not thick enough,I bought these as a cheaper alternative to wigwam hiking socks. While much cheaper they do not compare. Wigwam hiking socks are the best.
2,Scratchy! Not warm! Sweaty!,"These Wigwam ""at work"" socks sounded like exactly what I wanted, after reading all the amazon reviews. They're supposed to be soft (they are NOT soft - they feel like the fuzzy side of Velcro inside) they're supposed to be warm (they're not - they make my feet sweat instantly, and then they get clammy, even in boots!). They are fairly evenly cushioned (not very thick, but not a dress sock thin). I wouldn't want to walk more than a few blocks in these socks, unless I were also wearing very comfortable sneakers. They feel like I'm wearing plastic bags on my feet - instantly soggy, synthetic feeling, socks. Gross. Would never buy these again, unfortunately."
5,Whatever happened to Page Fletcher?,"THE HITCHHIKER was a mystery anthology series that aired from 1983-1987 on HBO and first choice in Canada, but then the series later moved to the USA Network from 1989-1991.Each episode is introduced and concluded by a mysterious wanderer known as ""The Hitchhiker"" and explores the foibles of humanity & its dark spirit. The title character was played by Nick Campbell from 1983-84 in only 3 episodes and then by Page Fletcher from 1984-91 in 82 episodes.This series had a total of 85 episodes over 6 Seasons with 39 first runs on HBO and 46 first runs on USA and the series was filmed in Vancouver & Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and France."
2,Disappointment's afoot,"Oh,dear. Mr. Millet has, I'm afraid, quite missed the mark. Let's say it right off - 'Too Long'. Over 300 dreary pages, when the story could have been told in half that. I have read many Holmes stories by authors other than Conan Doyle. Few have come close to the originals, but that's okay. Those men and women were not Doyle, so one must take what they get. But this novel was so very tedious. I think it should be noted that in the four Holmes novels by Doyle, Holmes himself was only in about half the story. Now we know why. Too much of even Sherlock Holmes can be a trial. I completed 'The Red Demon' only with great effort. I cannot recommend it."
5,IF YOU ARE A TAURUS AND,"YOU ARE FOLLOWING JUST ANY DIET...You will surely FAIL !The organism of each Zodiac sign, responds DIFERENT TO DIETS.If you are a Gemini, for instance, and are really decided to loose extra weight...TRUST THIS BOOK AND FOLLOW THE DIET DESIGNED SPECIALLY FOR YOUR SIGN!"
3,"Covers a lot, but lots of errors","This book covers a lot of great material, but it also has a lot of errors. Watch out! It can be frustrating to work and rework a problem or example, only to get the 'wrong' answer. I ended up writing MatLab scripts on a number of subjects, and proved to myself that I got the answer right... the book was wrong! Also, the writing style is confusing rather than illuminating. Still, I learned a lot -- including by proving the book wrong."
2,incorrect pump fitting,"I order this and the 15 gallon tank for my husband because everyone said it worked great. Both parts were received in good condition so no problems there. My husband managed to put most of it together but evidently the pump has changed because the instruction say to screw 3/8"" x 1/4"" nipple into sprayer pump that came on the sprayer has a 1/4"" barb only no place to screw anything in. If amazon would help with this matter to avoid sending back would greatly appreciate it.Precision Products TCS15 Spot Sprayer, 12-Volt, 15-Gallon"
5,I am a Sheena Larkin fan.,"It took me years to get this video, and the sound quality is horrendous, probably the worst quality video I ever bought - even worse than the pirated Chinese movies copied in the movie houses where the sound sucks.But Sheena Larkin was worth the suffering. Maybe some day I'll be able to buy a copy that should have been burned instead of being sold to me. The story is delightful."
3,Difficult to put on,"This is a high quality, pricey product and very difficult to put on. Measured carefully before ordering, but it's so tight that it took 2 people to put it on and take it off. Would give it a higher rating if it was easy to put on."
1,thumbs-down,"This book was such a waste of my time and money.I started it and couldn't finish it.There are many unappropriate scenes in this book.You might wannt to try Lois Duncan,Joan Lowery Nixon,and Caroline B.Cooney if you are looking for good horror-thrillers!"
2,bird cage,"not what i expected. the way it was described, i figured the playground was bigger that it actually is.due to that fact, not every item can be enjoyed and utilized by the parrot.. not really satisfied/////"
4,Firebirds,"Top Gun meets Airwolf IS Firebirds. The emphasis in Firebirds is on military helicopters like Cobras, Apaches, and Coyotes although on the movie they are called Scorpions(good band!). Excellent aerial filming with exciting ""dogfights""(aerial fights) make this movie a must-have for Top Gun, Blue Thunder, and Airwolf fans. Highly recommended!"
3,fire birds dvd,"This movie was ""ok"", it has some bad acting in it from the not so famous. Otherwise, it held our attention enough to watch once. We gave it away to someone, not good enough to see twice."
1,Very Poor,"Out of most of the ""B"" rated movies I've seen this had to be one of the worst. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,If you liked Top Gun....,"If you liked Top Gun...then go buy Top Gun. If you to know what army aviation is really like, then ask an army pilot, but do not, under any circumstances see this movie. this was 90 miniutes of my life i will never get back. Nick Cage's acting is up on the same scale as billy baldwin. this is the probably the only movie that ever made me want to walk out and take a smoke break (this reviewer is a non smoker). it's one redeeming factor is it's value to certian drinking games every time you hear a cheesy line from nick cage. i know i gave it one star, but i do not know how to rate in the negative."
1,"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen (exept ""I Am The Cheeze"")","I was in the Army when this came out, working on helicopters. I saw the movie at Travis AFB in California....well, as much as I saw. I DID walk out of the theatre. Even yelling quips at all of the cheezy lines (and there are plenty) wasn't entertainment enough to keep me from screaming at my shoes. I left fuming and spent the next hour waiting in a cold M1008 for the rest of my buddies to get done watching it. I'm sickened watching Nicholas Cage to this very day."
1,UGH!! THQ....?,"I always been a fan of thq wrestling since N64 and I own DAY OF RECKONING 1 & 2 on gamecube and I liked them,friday I picked up smackdwon vs 2007.Sigh...and I took it back monday morning,ok when I fought I got knocked down with a weak grapple only to tap the life out of my fingers trying to get back up...you spend too much d@*n time on the mat,horrible controls,even if looking in the book,SOOOO not much FUN< sucks A*$!!"
1,Worst Ever,"I can't believe people are rating this game at 4 or 5 stars. This is the worst wrestling game to date. I can't believe that they even released this.First, The grappling system is awful. You can barely control your wrestlers abilities, let alone grapple efficiently. Second, the announcers announce moves before hand or not at all. Third, The GM mode is the worst ""GM"" type mode that I have ever seen. You try to control matches to get better ratings. Sounds fun, really it's not.This game is an embarrassment to the video game industry as well as to the WWE. My only question is Why can't we go back to making them games exactly like World Tour, Wrestlemania 2000, and No Mercy? Those games were fun and easy to control.Trust me when I say, DONT BUT THIS GAME! WASTE OF MONEY!"
3,"Good Movie, Fun songs","This is my first purchase of a Bollywood movie from Amazon. I have purchased them from other places in the past. The price was right and it arrived on time and in good condition. Amazing story of conflict between young love and old pride.SriVin, Minneapolis."
4,Review for Mohabbatein,"This is not my favorite Shahrukh Khan film, but it was sweet and heartfelt. I think that I would have enjoyed it more had Shahrukh had more screen-time."
1,A book about nothing,Finally a book that talks about nothing. It is the first time that after reading a book I know exactly as before I started reading it.
5,A better book nowhere to be found,"Yak, yak, yak. I looked at all the win2000 books; started with Mastering Windows 2000 which everyone loves to talk at. There is no comparison to this book. This book is focussed precisely on what matters and this is so incredible. You won't fund hundreds of useless pages here--only what you need. Mr Stanek obviously knows his stuff and he's not afraid to share."
5,2nd edition even better than first,"I have the first edition and got the second edition immediaetly. With the second edition, Stanek has done a great job! This book is well written, easy to follow and concise, yet packed with lot's of useful information and hints and tips for Windows 2000. I consider myself a fairly expert Windows admin, but still learned quite a lot from this book. Like other Windows books that Stanek has written, this one is excellent for either new admins or experienced admins. I whole heartedly recommend this book to everyone."
3,Covers the basics,"This book is a pretty good summary of project management, but does not include critical lessons-learned from practitioners."
4,The leadership Centre Says,"As an Executive Coach, Management Team Builder and Leadership Development Trainer I read and studied several books on project management before selecting this one from which to create the nucleus of a Project Manager Training Program for my client. This is a complex and diverse subject and Verzuh takes his own advice to project managers by breaking it down into many bite sized, easily digestable pieces. For anyone at any level this makes Project Management do-able, while explaining its relevance to corporate culture."
3,Fast Forward MBA,"This is a good tip reference for business decisions. If you need a smack in the head for inspiration or a beginning course to reach a decision, the stuff you need may be found in this reference."
2,Blade held on by one sheet metal screw! Wobbly!,"Although the shovel looks ruggedly made, it is only as strong as it's weakest link: one sheet metal screw. The actual blade of the shovel is riveted to the bracket using 6 rivets but the bracket on the backside of the blade is held to the handle with only ONE sheet metal screw. This screw always loosens up making the shovel wobbly. Why didn't the manufacturer use several screws rather than just one? Is this shovel manufactured in Florida where they have no experience with snow? Nothing is more frustrating than shoveling and having the snow slide sideways off the end of the shovel because the blade has loosened one again. I now carry a screwdriver with me when I use this shovel. Eventually I'll drill some holes and install a few more screws. But why wasen't this done in the first place?"
5,Great DVD for Getting Rid of Back Pain,"I was introduced to Esther Gokhale's method through its broadcast on PBS (KQED). This DVD is essentially what they broadcast with additional bonus features. Esther's method has worked wonderfully for me. Her explanations about the anatomical and cultural root causes of many of our pains (such as back, knee, etc.) are easy to understand and they makes a lot of sense. Her method for regaining proper posture and thereby stretching our spine, strengthening the muscles and distributing weight properly are presented very clearly and are easy to follow. They become a natural part of your daily life (how to sit, lie down, walk, etc.)Esther has a very friendly demeanor, explains things very well, and her demonstrations clarify things. The testimonials of people are also very helpful.I strongly recommend using this DVD, and also her book ""8 Steps to a Pain-Free Back"" (also on Amazon). They complement each other very well."
3,"Well made, but undersized.","These are very well made shorts, that appear to be able to stand up to a high level of fitness swimming. *However*, Dolphin's sizing leaves a lot to be desired - I am a large frame individual, and purchased the 3XL, assuming (in the lack of a size chart) that it would fit like most other athletic/fitness 3XL sized, roughly in the 50"" range. This is far smaller than that, and would fit a 40-42"" waist size."
3,A Little Overpriced...,"Item is of good quality, however design is slightly awkward. Durable and very bright. Adjustable beam/focus does not seem to work very well. Overall, Item is a little overpriced for what you get."
1,Does not come with battery or charger - useless,Does not come with battery or charger - useless. I don't even know where or how much the battery would be.
3,"Great Tour, but didn't like the DVD","I was disappointed with this DVD. I have visited Rothenburg, Germany and loved this tour. The guide (who has been doing this tour for years) is a funny, entertaining person, but that did not come across. Also, they didn't give the history of the famous clock in this wonderful town. Too much history with drawings and not enough of the Night Watchman himself giving the history!"
5,Great things come in small packages!,"Although I have several bread machine cookbooks today, this was my first. My copy is so dog-earred that it's falling apart. Although the book is small, it is jam packed with a huge variety of tasty recipes that are surprisingly easy. If you only buy one bread book-this would be a great choice."
4,Great Bread Machine Recipe Book,"Lots of great, easy and nutritious recipes. My only complaint would be that my machine comes with a rapid rise selection, and this book does not have that as a choice, so I have to look in the owner's manual recipe book to try and find a similar recipe so I know how much extra yeast to add to the recipe. Kind of a pain, but I still want to get some of her other bread machine cookbooks, because this one is very good!"
4,Good Place to Start,"While the book has a lot of helpful information, a lot of the basics are left to the imagination. Not a beginners book but very informative!"
5,Best Value for the features...period.,"With the stats, from this vendor, you cannot get a better deal. I could not be more satisfied with bag and All Sleeping Bags (vendor)."
3,Wilderness Campaign,"This is a book of essays concerning the Battle of the Wilderness in May 1864. It is a collection of essays about that particular campaign, by noted writers and historians. The book might not be for the general reader, but I am writing a book about Robert E. Lee and U.S. Grant. This is a very valuable source of informataion for anyone writing about these two generals, since it is the first time they faced each other on the field of battle. I am enjoying this book and its essays about the tactics employed by Lee and Grant."
4,Coma Cult Classic,"Great movie--this should be a favorite for viewers who like thrillers. The idea that a doctor would actually, and on purpose, make people brain dead hits us in a vulnerable spot--we trust our doctor and to think he might do this to us makes us very uncomfortable--you are defenseless against this type of act--and that is scary. Who knows when you have surgery if you will wake up or not--it is already a fear and then Coma brings this fear to the surface. Scary!"
3,Too much dialog!,"I've read the book COMA and prefer it much more than the movie. During about the first part of the movie, there is a lot of dialog and is a little boring. Starting into the second half though, things start to step up! This is a great science fiction movie!"
5,The F-Bass A great picture show!,"Well, lots of beautiful USA Precision and Jazz basses in this book. Wel done on glossy paper. Nice chapter with details to indentify your USA bass. Real value for money! If you own a P or J Fender bass, you should own this book. The only set back is little attention is payed to the Mustang. Hollow bodies and the Music Master don't appear at all in this book. When they're in I'll buy the second edition too."
5,The greatest thing since the instrument itself.,"Bass player, guitar guru or history junky, The Fender Bass is required reading. J Black and Albert Molinaro have put together a comprehensive and enjoyable journey into the evolution of the world's favorite bass. Hundreds of vivid color photos, vintage advertisements and behind the scene glimpses at Fender, chronicles each minute detail and nuance of the ever-changing bass. Close up photography, clear, detailed writing and precise index create a useable technical reference book as well as a delightful read.This book cleverly walks through the past and present of this amazing and historically significant instrument. The Fender Bass is a must have for any bass player, guitarist or Fender fan. Buy it now."

1,Slanted and Disenchanted,"Would any fan of Ronald Reagan really want to give money to PBS? I found this program disturbingly slanted. It takes several cheapshots at Reagan's personal life. You never see PBS take on the Kennedys (to name an example) in the same way. I give it one star because it never captures the essence of Reagan as a great leader. You see brief snippets of him talking (finally, the Great Communicator in his glory!) only to be interrupted by the mindless patter of people with some sort of political agenda or ax to grind. If you're really curious, why not tape this instead (PBS is bound to re-broadcast it a couple of dozen times). If you have fond memories of Reagan skip this tape."
4,Wish Come True by Eileen Goudge,Had been looking for this book for years and finally found it at Amazon. It was the last in a series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. You can always find things at Amazon.com when you can't locate anywhere else.
5,Great book,"Like the other books in the Carson Springs series, this is an excellent book. The plot is different from the others which keeps it interesting. I like how the characters from the other books are all involved in the story as well."
3,Invaluable resource for casting,"I am happy to have this great book. The book was apparently written some years ago as you can tell from the pictures, but the information is invaluable. Anyone wanting to cast brass will find this a treasure! I would have rated this book higher if the pictures were of a higher quality, and the information was more comprehensive. By comprehensive, I am referring to the specifics of building the nozzle for the furnace... This information was not fully covered. However it is still a very valuable resource."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I'm a fan of Rocksteady but this collection did not live up to expectations. I am a proud and pleased owner of some other very fine Trojan Box Sets, namely ""Club Reggae"" and ""Tighten Up"" both of which I would recommend over the ""Rocksteady"" set. Don't get me wrong, there are some great artists on the roster, but the song selections seem plodding and tired. (some people like their Reggae along those lines.) Besides, the ""Rocksteady"" set is one of the few Trojan Box packages that you can actually listen to snippets of here on Amazon so you're more able to decide for yourself. This is certainly not a bad collection, but if you're planning on acquiring more of the Trojan Box Sets leave ""Rocksteady"" for later."
5,I also bought this at Sears,"I picked this up last year on the clearence table for $25. I knew nothing about this brand. I really bought it for charging my ipod classic. I was really surprised by the sound. It will play my itouch generation2, but will not charge it. I guess I should have picked up another one for my son. I would not pay $400 for it, but for $25 bucks I can't complain."
5,Courageous story,"A lovely book about a white, Episcopalian family that went to live in a difficult neighborhood in Jersey City. For eight years, they and their growing family lived among the poor,the hungry, the rejected and the exploited. This was in 1949, before it was commun to do so. Did their presence there solve problems and make changes. Perhaps not so much; it was their presence there that God worked through."
4,The Title Says It All,"Dr. Criswell's Guidebook for Pastors? is well named. The book is Dr. W.A. Criswell?s manual on pastoral ministry. In the 385-page volume he examines a wide variety of aspects in pastoral ministry including the pastor?s personal life, devotional life, sermon preparation, sermon delivery, staff relationships, church polity, church finances, building projects, and counseling. It includes examples of wedding ceremonies, funeral services, instructions for administrating church ordinances, and numerous other beneficial guidelines for novices. Criswell is practical, clear, and comprehensive. Despite the fact that portions seem antiquated, the underlying principles are of significant value in today?s church. The greatest tribute to the book is the life and ministry of the man who penned it. Dr. Criswell was the greatly respected pastor of First Baptist in Dallas, Texas and was the president of the Southern Baptist Convention 1969-70."
4,Kevin Smith Fans Will Love It.,"I bought this book for my husband who is a huge Kevin Smith fan. If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you are easily offended by language, the occasional potty humor and thinking out of the main stream its probably not the book for you. He is a brilliant writer who can write about everything from being obese to meeting Tom Cruise. It's a good (and quick) read."
3,"Page count is misleading, very short book.","The book has 300 some odd pages, but some pages are only half filled with writing, there are a few blank pages in between each chapter, so literally, you could condense this book into 100 pages. It's easily a one evening read, which sucks for the price. If you dig Kevin Smith than you will enjoy this book, but be prepared for a short read that is mostly a Ben Affleck tribute book. He goes on and on about him, how he loves him, how he's the greatest ever,that's at least 3/4 of the book."
5,Great for fans of Kevin Smith,"This book had some good,funny stories. Kevin is a genius story teller and this book is a must have for any fan. Also check out his podcasts...Smodcast,Jay & Silent Bob Get Old and Hollywood Babble On"
4,"Delightful, quick read.","If you are a fan of Kevin Smith, this is like listening (or reading) to one of his Q&A;'s, minus the Q's. Read it in a day and a half and enjoyed the stories. A little dated, but if you can't get enough of Kevin Smith, this is the enjoyable read your looking for!Kevin chronicles his interviews with Tom Cruise and Ben Affleck, talks about his full length nude painting of the wife as well as behind the scenes talk of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and the dreaded Jersey Girl(which he writes a complete gush fest about). If interested in this, get it!"
1,this book was stupid,"i am only 17 and i can see that this book was stupid. i only read it because i got it from my friend and it was free, but don't waist your money cause none of it made sense."
3,it was alright but better than the first book,"this was ok i enjoyed better than the first book, just my opinion the ending was not what i expected it kind of was disapointing. but the book was better than the first one"
3,alright,"it's alright, though the design wasn't what i expected it to be. There's better ones out there"
5,Why not?,"I really did agree with TOT's decision to change direction in their music since, eventhough i did like their earlier music, i was never convinced before, that, that was what they wanted to be doing!Bands should progress never remain stagnant and stuck to a particular style just because they got used to it...I think they should incorporate disco elements in their music so that they will have an even more interesting mixture. Imagine gothmetaldiscodance...Wouldn't that be cool?"
3,Poems for Peter,"I have been looking for this book for years. My grandmother used to read it to me when I was little, and read it to herself when she was little. The original copy of the book, that she had was lost somewhere along the way, and we have been trying to find it ever since. She was really pleased that I was able to find it here. The poems are nice, simple and timeless. They really seem to capture the quirkiness of a child's mind."
5,Great for selling books...nice for the price.,"Shipped fast and though they may be generic, they're fine and work great, came fast and you can't beat the price. I did order 10.5 x16 though and my last order had just slightly smaller envelopes. I sell books a lot and while you might not need to separately bubble wrap your books since these are padded, I always do (but I've done that with the more expensive envelopes also.) Even doing that, I could get away with the SLIGHTLY smaller envelopes I got before - maybe 10x15 or 10.5x15 or even 14, for standard books and dvd sets, just fyi. Still, these work great and are priced right. Nice job!"
3,hold up through long distance shipping,So glad I didn't buy these at any retail stores in my area. They are about 4 times more expensive when buying from local retail stores. I bought these to ship t-shirts. Have sent to many countries around the world. These envelopes hold up through long distance shipping as well. Excellent product.
5,An Awsome Resource For Teenagers,"I read Perk! and I really liked it. I think that every teenage girl should read it. With the critism today, and the impression that girls should be thin, beautiful, and look like a barbie doll many girls suffer from bulimia and anorexia. I think that this book will help many young women and teenagers, as well as adults see the negative affects of bulimia.It shows girls that it only makes you look worse. Hopefully it will show girls that they should accept their bodies the way they are. I personally have never suffered from either of these diseases, but I do know that many young girls and women suffer from it , and I think this book will help them,and also hep those who are thinking about starving themselves or throwing up after meals."
3,Not the best I have read,"Perk is a novel about one girl's struggle with her family issues, and how it leads her to bulimia. Her family is cruel to her, and seem to care about her little sister more than they do about Perk. This leads Perk to binge and purge. This becomes the most important thing to her until something serious happens and Perk realizes that she can no longer live this way.The ending is poor. It makes recovery from an eating disorder seem very easy and like eating disorders are more of a choice then an illness. However, it is a good read if you are as obsessed with eating disorder literature as I am."
4,A Little Gem,"This quiet little film offers a tangled web of interesting characters. The film jacket implies wit and laughs; wit perhaps, but more touching sadness from every day people singed by tragic flaws. The wrap up is very satisfying in its own way. Also, Russell Crowe fans will appreciate his deft and sensitive performance in a pivotal role."
4,Great Product,"I've never owned a navigator other than this one. But, it was much better than expected. I just moved out-of-state, and I rely 100% on the navigator to get me where I need to go. It's not perfect of course.The mp3 feature is a great addition too. The only thing that did not work was the phone pairing. You have to scream just for the other person to hear you."
3,Good Rating but don't buy it,"this is an excellent unit with bluetooth, MP3 Player, and all the gadgets and whistles. I've owned 5 Street Pilots, from the 330 on up, and all will get you where you want to go. So why do I say don't buy it? Garmin no longer supports this unit and you will not be able to get it repaired if you have a problem. They stopped supporting the 550 and the 580, so you are buying an obsolete unit which you will have to trash can if something goes wrong. They still support the 330 and 340 StreetPilot, so if you don't need to talk on the phone through your unit, or listen to music, buy the StreetPilot 330 or 340 for a lot less money, and still get factory support."
4,I love this thing,"This is the first GPS I have owned. However, I have used many. This thing is so easy to use I didn't even have to read the directions before I strted to use it. I do wish some things were changed though. I found to get the full benifit of the bluetooth I had to purchase the external mic so people could hear me without yelling. I would also like it if I could block it from it trying to have me go through Manhattan. Every time I get near that region it tells me to go through Manhattan instead of going around it (suicide). And finally I find the reception to be very spotty for the traffic.I know it sounds like i may be bashing this this but I find these issues to be minor, and I really love this thing. It has saved me from getting lost, being late, and helps me avoid traffic.I highly recommend this unit."
5,great GPS,This street pilot is fantastic. Put the voice on British ( Charles) and it is a neat drive when he speaks to you. It is right on target and simple to use. Price on Amazon is greatly under local stores and shipping is prompt. Highly recommend
4,Almost perfect!,The Garmin c550 is very easy to use right out of the box. Just turn it on and go. It quickly finds satellites and is extremely fast in calculations and accurate. The only complaint I have is with the age of the built in mapping. Several roads which have been around for over 7-8 years are still not in the database and restaurants which closed down over 5 years ago still are. The Bluetooth functionality works great although I would recommend buying the external microphone unless you're driving a car which is very quite inside. Overall I definitely recommend this product!
2,"Great, when it doesn't die on you","I've gone through two of these. The first i exchanged at the store, the second was past the 14 day return policy, so I had to mail it in at my expense.They work great for the first few weeks. The first one died around when the temp was getting into the 100s, so I thought ""Ok, maybe the heat did it"". The second died overnight when the temp was around 60. Just won't turn on anymore.I've read other reviews indicating a similar problem. Hopefully Garmin can send me a non-defective unit. In the meantime, be careful and make sure you can return it.** UPDATE **The returned unit from Garmin has been working flawlessly. I believe they have worked out the defect in the original batch."
5,Dont need a GPSto find this great deal!,"This product is wonderful!! It has saved my relationship several times over. My wife usually directs and I object, then the fight starts... not anymore. My GPS KNOWS where to take me and how! Easy to use, offers several options with the points of interest, and the traffic indicator saved me a 30 min. wait in traffic on day. Best price anywhere too. 10/10."
5,Best Buy,"After much research, I believe this Garmin to be the best buy for the money. I purchased one for my son, then, after finding it cheaper on Amazon.com, I purchased another for my daughter. They absolutely love the Garmin and have sold me on it. I am going to purchase one for myself. My daughter said the directions are given before you need to make a turn, not right as you are passing the street as most do."
3,I can't get lost,"This thing is pretty cool, but I want to get lost for the weekend and this thing won't let me. What does a man have to do to be free?? Plus, it keeps telling me what to do when I drive, like 'turn here' and 'turn there.' I am getting po'ed at this thing... I will do what I want to do when I drive, and this thing isn't going to tell me what to do!"
4,Everything I was looking for!,"This product has lived up to my expectations. I have yet to use the Bluetooth tech or the MP3 player but, then again, why do you buy a GPS? I live in a major city and the real time traffic alert is great. The only negative point I have is that the volume could be a bit louder, especially with the background noise while traveling at high speeds or with the window down. I highly recommend this product."
3,GarminC550,"GarminC550 is easy to use.Great features are: announcing upcoming turns ( including street name) well in advance, reiterating street and turn when you are a few feet away, estimated time of arrival, easy to follow road map (including what street you are on and nexy cross street.Annoying features are: Even though I live near Boston, many areas it will not work, doesn't always give you the shortest route, sometimes thinks you are in another town, still does not come with the greatest attachments to your window.Although this product is better than the 350...Garmin still has a way to go before it can compete with a factory installed GPS system/Garmin StreetPilot c550 Bluetooth Automotive Traffic GPS System Includes: FREE Shipping, FREE PhotoBlocker Spray, FREE E-Book, and FREE Database of Red-Light Cameras, Speed Traps, Speed Cameras, and DUI Checkpoints"
4,File Under: Celtodelic ROck'n'Reel,"This is a fascinating album, if only because the packaging might almost have been designed to scare folk fans away -- it looks like a heavy-metal band (and with that name...)But, once you get past that, this is Great Stuff... if you're not the type who insists on ""authenticity"" or ""appropriate instruments"". If you like Fairport Convention and/or the Pogues, you will most likely like BiL.On this particular album, the standouts are:""Madman Mora Blues"", which is a lovely modern take on the traditional theme of the madman. While it takes a different attitude, if compared with Fairport's ""Crazy Man Michael"", it does not suffer.""The MicroOrganism"" -- a love song, a plague song, a strange haunting ballad for the Age of HIV.""Pig Dog Daddy"" -- screaming punk mayhem with one of the funniest lyrics in a long time.You should buy this album."
3,Interesting historical foot note,"At about 20 minutes, its an interesting slide show with nariation.If your interested in historical male nudes, you might want to keep a pad and pen ready.Succedes as a pleasant time waster."
5,Release The Power,"PowerNomics should be required reading for every African American book club, community organization, church, and family. The book embodies tenents set forth from Marcus Garvey to Elijah Muhammed to DuBois and Washington. If you believe that ""God helps those who help themselves,"" PowerNomics is an action plan to achieve self-sufficiency."
2,I wanted to like this book,I wanted to like this book but the suggestions are so unrealistic and in some cases so wrong that I can't reccomend it.
2,Herbal Vade Mecum,I found this book difficult to follow. I feel it's for a more advanced herbal student. It was not very helpful to me.
1,Dangerous!!!,"My son received the imaginarium train table with a set for Christmas this year. This is the exact train that came with the set. He has been playing with it now for almost three months none stop - loves it! What is upsetting is that the magnets that hold the trains in place come loose, pop out and can not only be a serious choking hazard but if more than one magnet is ingested could cause serious digestive problems that could warrant surgery. Buyer beware and be prepared to watch you children intently especially if they are under three years of age. We have not yet had any problems with any of the Thomas line of trains and those magnets."
5,Great book,The book has great in depth meanings to how business should be conducted and they just happen to be talking about a leader in the field. Disney is the best when it comes to customer satisfaction and the story is told in a very unique way. Try it you will like it.
5,"Neat, sturdy and maximum room","These are really handy and, because they are stackable but not nesting, there are no bosses in the interior to reduce storage space."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"This is the greatest science curriculum ever! I don't use it alone though. We frequent the library to supplement what we are learning. But all the worksheets are wonderful! Its very in-depth on most topics and where you feel you need more find a library book. The music although not perfectly on key, are cute songs that are catchy and children learn in a carefree way. I find myself singing the songs as well. The workbook is mostly reproducibles and the teachers guide is all the reading. There is also a yahoo email group (e-group) for people who use and love this curriculum!"
1,Very Disappointing,"The earrings were so tiny I could hardly hold them in my hand, not at all like the picture displayed. Will never order from that company again."
5,i was amued,"i like this movie because it had a nice story , realistic problems , and a cute romance subplot. mandy moore and trent ford have chemistry and the movie makes you smile. what more can you ask for from a movie."
5,Much better then I expected,"I was expecting to see anothersimplistic summer movie, but I was surprised how good it was. The movie has saddness, laughter, happiness all in one. Janney is great in the movie and Moore is also good.The only bad part was the Mandy Moore-ism, like poutty lips and her stares. We've seen the same in ""A walk to Remember""."
1,um.....,"i really disliked this movie. i read one of the books it was based on (it was based on two) and it was nothing like the book. i hated this movie and i think that it sends a bad message out to girls. it makes it seem like it is ok to have a boyfriend that treats you poorly. i love mandy moore, but this was a horrible movie.. yuck."
1,Not that great.....,"This movie is completely different from Mandy's other film. I cannot say I really enjoy this movie. It was just plain awful and disappointing. This movie also sends out bad messages that it's okay to go out and have sex with boys. What kind of movie is this? When Scarlett discovers that she's pregnant, I would expect her mother to freak out. Instead, her mother responds how she was glad that Scarlett told her just in time. A Walk To Remember was the best movie I saw which is played by Mandy Moore. I'm sorry if I'm offending some people, but this is not her greatest work. And hopefully, she will continue to do more wonderful movies."
2,not the best,"the movie was kinda well, dumb. It seemed like it was trying to be a good angsty teen film with morals. It ended up being a sappy, boring mess.The divorce and teen pregnancy were pretty good topics to cover, but it would have been better without the boyfriend dying...it was over the top. They did do a pretty good job with showing the pressures of sex though. But the whole love story thing was too syrupy!!! The ""when you fall, I'll catch you"" crap is too lovey and mushy and overly romantic. They're only in high school!!! I'm not even gonna mention the fact that Trent and Mandy had like no chemistry!!!In the end, Mandy and the girl who played her friend did a good job. But the film had too much drama to be likable.To be honest, I only watched it for Mandy Moore and Sean Astin's brother, Mackenzie Astin anyway!!!"
3,Not Bad,"A good film, but Macon and Halley's relationship is rushed, one Moment tHeir meeting as distant aquaintance, the next scene, their making out, which made me more intrested in her sister'S REALTIONSHIP."
2,Silly and Embarrassing,"When Halley's loser dad divorces their mom for a trophy wife half his age, Halley rebels, dating bad boy Macon.What can I say? I didn't like this movie. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters, and thought Halley's parents needed to be less selfish and spend time actually PARENTING and less time pursuing ther own selfish interests. Both Halley and her sister were shockingly immature, and her sister was far too young to get married and act responsibly. Their relationships seemed doomed for failure.Instead of feeling 'inspired' and impressed with the 'plucky' female characters in this movie, I ended up feeling depressed at the decline of the American family.Two stars for a boring, and banal teen-flick"
5,My five year old loves this book!,"I hear ""read it again please"" all the time. My five year old loved the book (I did too). The characters are friendly, the illustrations are top quality but it's the story that makes the book a real keeper."
3,Supportive but painful,"I went with Active Ankle because I have used them many times in my life. I received my new T2s a few months ago and have used them a hand-full of times. I'm hoping I just need to break them in more, because they really hurt my ankles because they rub on them when I'm playing. Even when I wear two pairs of thick socks, my ankles really hurt from the rubbing afterward. I also have really skinny/boney ankles which might be part of the problem. Other than that they are supportive and do what they're suppose to do."
2,PRIME??,"I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS SUPOUSED TO BE HERE WITHIN TWO DAYS, AFTER I CLICKED PLACE ORDER IT SAYS 5 DAYS...5 DAYS?????????????????????????????? IM WAITING.... WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPEN WITHIN THOS ""2"", SORRY ""5"" DAYS!!!"

5,A Biography on Marilyn that dares discover to the truth...,"This is an ""exelent"" book by Anthony Summers, So well written from beginning to end, this is a book that every Marilyn Fan should have in their bookshelf. You can really appreciate all the time he has devoted in writing ""GODDESS."" Anthony Summers gives a detailed description of the life and death of Marilyn Monroe. He addresses many sensitive topics that many would not have dare write about, for example the reason why she was murdered, who did it and what was their motive, I love this book exactly for that reason, At last someone dared to discover the truth."
4,A Galloping Civil War Story,I've been reading a lot of Civil War books lately and this is the best of the bunch so far. A memorable close-up of the wide-spread corruption in the government and the outrageous incompetency of the Union generals set within a galloping mystery story. The lead character was strong and sympathetic; I sure wanted him to win. He also helped me to understand how and why someone could get addicted to pain killers. The ending was perhaps a bit overblown but it sure kept me clicking my kindle! I zoomed through it in one rainy Sunday afternoon.
5,Love the design!,Got this for my mom for mother's day. She just loved it! We love the pattern design and the size is perfect for her use.
2,I Don't Understand All the 5-Star Reviews,"As an avid true crime fan, I found this book to be little more than just another story about two people plotting the murder of a third. There is no insight provided with regard to the Sharee character -- We are presented with ""what she did"", but there is no real exploration of her character - & what really motivated her. In my opinion, the book cover (with its lurid picture and ""Internet hype"") clearly suggested something more than this book was able to deliver.If you want to read a GOOD book about Internet deception and murder, I would highly recommend ""The Internet Slavemaster"" by John Glat. Insofar as character development, the book probably does not deliver much more than ""Fatal Error"", but there is certainly a lot more action, deception, and murder."
1,THE MOVIE SUCKS!,"I was looking forward to seein this movie,the movie was stupid and NOT funny at all.Infact it was very boring. I recommand the original hit Dumb & Dumber from 1994."
1,When Crappy Met Film...,"My God... I have seen some terrible movies in my day but this one could very well be the worst of all. Poor Jim Carrey must have torn every hair follicle from his scalp one by one when he saw this disgraceful prequel to the classic ""Dumb and Dumber."" It truly is a shame when it seems that people make movies simply based on the success of the first one but don't put in the same effort. I didn't laugh once... in fact there wasn't so much as a grin from my mouth. I tried and tried to look for some half decent humor but alas... my search was in vain. Do yourself a favor, if your going to buy this movie regardless of what my review may say... be prepared to throw away $30 on something you'd be better off flushing down the toilet."
2,Bob Saget saves it,Yes it's stupid and terrible but Come on when Saget opens his bathroom and finds choclate stains everwhere that's funny. I'm sorry but the slurpee scene was pointless but the lesbian kiss make up for it. Now the slurpee worker was funny especially the revenge he gets on Harry and lloyd. This was a unneccassary sequel that has a terrible script but has 4 good laughs and lesbians. Will be remebered with the great sequels like high noon 2 and critters 4. By the way the opening scene with his jaintor father is great.
1,Hideously stupid...,"Well I was stupid because I actually wanted to see this because I loved the first one so much. After suggesting the movie to my friends we went and saw it, and I have to say that I'm embarrassed that I recommended everyone to see it. The chocolate scene in the bathroom was completely stupid because it was just impossible to get that much chocolate out of one hershey bar. What a waste of time..."
1,Please NO,"Sweet mother of God! Did we not say all that we needed to say(assuming any of it had to be said at all!) in the first one? I mean really, the first one was incredibaly stupid, to put it lightly and this one was even worse. Unless you want your IQ to drop five points, do not watch this..uh..'film'."
4,underrated?,"A lot of people don't like this movie because they just compare it to the original Dumb and Dumber and want to see the same actors, but I think it is a funny movie. The casting it very good. The actors really seem like the original films' younger. Although somet things are a bit cliche and expected, it is still enjoyable."
1,JUST PLAIN DUMB.,"Making a sequel to one of the funniest movies ever without the 2 guys that made it funny? Whoever thought this up should be fired immediately, it was that stupid an idea. I was excited when I first heard of this movie because I loved the original movie so much and I thought nobody would be stupid enough to make a sequel to the original without Carrey and Daniels, look how wrong you can be. I had the flu when I first watched Dumb and Dumber and still laughed hysterically at it, it was that funny. This movie only made me feel like I was sick. No Carrey and no Daniels=no laughs. Fans of the laugh filled original should avoid this at all costs."
2,2 and a half stars,"ok, I am a HUGE fan of the original, but this prequel was lacking. It had a few semi-humorous moments, but other parts as well where it really dragged on and I was asking myself ""what is this leading to?"" or ""when are they going to go to the next scene?"", particuarly when they're drinking the slurpees. The story line was a bit stupid. I did, however, enjoy Cheri Oteri in this movie. The funniest scene was probably Bob Saget reacting to the chocolate in the bathroom.Anyway, wait for it to be shown on tv. I don't think it's worht paying 8 bucks for."
4,Another Great Leslie Sansone Walking Video,"Love this 3-mile video. Leslie changes up the moves to keep it interesting, and it's high paced...enough to get you sweating. She does make a couple of mistakes in her cues, but who cares? She's always easy to follow, regardless. The only con to this video, if there is one, is it's Leslie by herself. I like when she has her whole crew...it's a little more fun that way. But she's plenty lively by herself."
3,Too much talking an too little exercising!,"I personally didn't find this tape too challenging. There are very few exercises and I feel like Kathy spends most of the time talking and explaining, rather than keeping a fast pace and making the best out of the exercises. For a tape that focuses ONLY in the upper body, she could have done so much more in the same amount of time! The moves are good but too few of them.I also find a little bit annoying that I have to fast forward more than 2 thirds (or so it seems!) of the tape until I reach the exercise part!. And once I get to the exercise part, I found myself pausing every couple minutes to listen to an anatomy explanation (after you've heard it once, you don't need to hear it over and over!).I find that this tape doesn't have the momentum, the constant rhythm that keeps you engaged at all time, it's quite the opposite. Maybe this tape would work better for REAL beginners that have never done toning before, but they may grow tired of it as well."
4,What's going on here?,"This movie is good entertainment. I found myself asking the question ""What's going on here?"" as every new scene seemed to further complicate the story. The film keeps you guessing about the various characters and thus keeps you engaged throughout. This is a film that you can easily see twice because the second time through you know the basic story and then you can just sit back and enjoy the action."
2,Glass Broke within a week,Glass seemed to be pretty cheap and broke within a week. The holder is nice and was working great until the glass cracked. Luckily it didn't shatter but still frustrating.
3,Stylish but not durable.,"It's pretty, and very cheap, which is quite nice. I managed to use it for several months before the glass cracked. If you're looking for something that will last, get a different product."
3,Quaint 1930/40s Hollywood telling,"This movie is typical of the sentiments and production values of the late 30's, early 40's. What I mean is that the more interesting, progressive - perhaps even controversial - points of the Castle's story were not even addressed. If this movie were made today, those would be focal points. This movie dilutes, and/or leaves out, the degree of the Castle's impact.For example, I was hoping this telling would include the Castle's African American band director James Europe Reese. Nope . . . not for a story telling in 1939.In and of itself, the movie is entertaining. Who better to play the Castles than Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers? They certainly make the dances look easy. However, viewing the movie through our 21st century perspective, the movie seems quaint and ""safe.""Watch the movie for Fred and Ginger and an introduction to the successes of the Castles; read historical accounts to get the details, drama, and cultural impact of the Castles' lives."
5,7th Season,"The DVD set is a great gift for any Murder She Wrote fan. The set contains many heart warming episodes from Cabot Cove Maine. Jessica, Seth, Sherriff Mort Metzger and Co. work together to solve the mysterious murders that seem to abound in this quaint oceanside town."
4,Better than their debut,"If you liked their first album, you'll LOVE this one!If you disliked their first album, you'll LIKE this one!"
4,An okay album that definitely gets better with time.,"I liked Audioslave's first album, and Out of Exile is almost as good, but not quite. First of all, perhaps it's just me, but many of the songs sounded quite similar. Tom Morello's still a great guitar player but I felt as if he was getting stuck in a rut here; he said in an interview that it was the first time he'd ever come to recording sessions without some kind of sense of what he was going to be playing, and I think that shines through rather well -- it's not as impressive as before.Cornell's vocals are still good as well but overall I was left a bit underwhelmed. This isn't as good as the albums Rage Against the Machine (Morello and gang's best) or Superunknown (Cornell's masterpiece). And it isn't even as good as Audioslave's first album. I hope their next one is better, but for what this is, it's a good listen and definitely gets better with time. (It's kind of grown on me.)"
5,Great Album!,"This album is better than I expected. I did in fact, expect to here much of the same from the first album, but you get the sense that Audioslave has meshed even better on ""Out of Exile"". The group combines the best of both former bands, Soundgarden and RATM. Cornell is at his best sounding much like the singer on ""Superunknown"". Morello and Co. are at their classic best, beating out vibes for the album. What is great about the album is how rounded it actually sounds....it doesnt sound like two separate bands trying to make a record together (like the first Audioslave effort). All in all, if you are fan of 90's hard rock...this is an album for you!"
4,"Not Rage , Not Soundgarden, but great.","The reviews on this CD are going one or two ways. People either love it or hate it. I've listened to it a few times now and while it is different from the first Audioslave CD I think it's actually better. The songs on here aren't as heavy but I think they are better. It takes balls for them to do more uplifting songs like ""Doesn't Remind Me"" and ""Dandelion"" (which are two of my favorites on here). It's good to see they don't feel like they have to do the same type songs Rage and Soundgarden did. Just remember this is Audioslave not RageGarden. Completely differnt band. If you feel they shouldn't change you can always go back and listen to ""Evil Empire"" and ""Superunknown""."
4,Out of Exile,"Out of Exile being Audioslave's 2nd studio album and their 2005 release was met good reviews by the critics and Allmusic and the Austin Chronicle gave it both 4 stars. The album was also well received by the public and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 and the Canadian album chart. Singles released from this album were ""Be Yourself"", ""Your time has come"", ""Doesn't remind me"" and ""Out of Exile"". The booklet is quite nice with all the lyrics, some very nice photographs of the band. 4/5."
2,Hearporch or: Frustration at the calculator,"2 1/2The kind of contrived radio friendly material which generates a multitude of mediocrity amidst a few earnest gems. Usually the whiff of disposable Rage-Soundgarden outtake aroma permeates the vibe, although a practical, accessible approach behind many of these often insignificant sections is certain."
2,Out of Energy!,"Audioslave gave soundgarden and rage against the machines fans something to cheer about with their debut. Now they release their sophomore album OUT OF EXILE. The first single Be Yourself is a slow moving but great song. Meanwhile the rest of the album falls flat for the most part.It opens with the rocker Your time is come which reminds one of the first single from Audioslave's first album. The 2nd track, out of exile, which the album is named after is a pretty good song, but after the 3 aforementioned songs the album is just not that good. There isn't enough originality only the continuation of the same sound throughout. It just lacks any really great songs and if Audioslave continues to release albums (which means they need to release something better than this), this one could be the one overlooked and least listened to by most fans. I was highly anticipating this album but my anticipation turned out to be poorly placed."
2,Save your cash,"I am very very disapointed about the newAudio Slave album.This is not as good asthe first album and in fact it's not verygood at all.The first album is the best albumso far that they've put out.They did say thatthey had all these song's already written whenthe first one came out.They took all the bestsong's and put them on the first record.Now onthe new album what you're getting is the leftover crap that they didn't want on the firstalbum.Although there are a couple decent song'son out of exile such as ""Your time has come"" and""Be your self"" are what I feel the best 2 song'son here.""Be yourself"" is already over played onmost rock stations and I'm sick of hearing it.There's also alot of slow song's on here and notmany rockin' tunes at all.Not they having slowsong's is a bad thing but too much of it justget's boring and not entertaining to the listener.So save your money and buy something that's better."
4,not as good as the first,"I was dissapointed, its too mellow for a fan of Soundgarden or RAGE or even the orginal album. Some ok tracks, but the singles are meant for airplay and not as powerful as previous work."
2,Would the real Led Zepplin stand up?,At least on this one they tone down their I hate America politics. But once again this sounds like a cheap imitation of Led Zepplin. I like albums with diversity and don't need the constant banging and thrashing but once again they have put out an uninspired and unoriginal album. I am not sure of their goal with this album but it will sit nicely next to your 3 Doors Down album and you will probably hear an Audioslave song following a 3DD song on crappy modern rock radio. This is definitely NOT metal and is more adult contemporary/power pop. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of songs on here that I really like but I wish I would have downloaded them instead of buying the whole album.
2,Why?,"When I was growing up in the late 80's and early 90's I liked Soundgarden and I liked Rage Against the Machine and I wonder where these guys have gone wrong. You think that these guys could put together one great album, but all you get are 2 or 3 songs and nothing else but filler.When I first heard a soundgarden song, Loud Love, I thought Chris was pretty cool, but now he is nothing but a sell out and the same goes for the rest of the guys in the band, What made Rage good was the way they played, now all it is to me is a amped up Coldplay (who SUCK and our just too stupid to give a bad reveiw too) and I wonder where the intense music went too.You want to hear a good album, try Love/Hates new album, Jizzy is not a sell out and knows what to give the fans. A good old rocking album"
2,Not impressive,Most of the songs in the Cd are not good. I found only a couple of songs worth listening to.
2,DOESN'T QUITE GET THERE.......,I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS AS GOOD AS A SOUNDGARDEN OR RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE RELEASE.TRY AGAIN GUYS........
4,GET OVER IT!!!,"MY FREAKIN GOD!!!!! I'm reading the other reviews here. Get over it. Don't compare bands. Damn!!! How can you compare preferences, cause that's all that it is, PREFERENCES. I like the taste of sweet, you like the taste of sour, SO WHAT!Anyways,this album is pretty good atcually. A lot of good songs here. These guys are capable of doing great music, I just wished they would've pushed the envelope a little bit more. Highlights for me include, #1Zero, Dandelion, Yesterday To Tomorrow & Heaven's Dead. I came to like the songs that remind me the least of they're previous band. Good album!"
3,Must be read with an open mind,"The book basically contains 3 parts: Some of Edgar Cayce's readings related to Atlantis; The evidences both from a Geology and Archaeology viewpoint; and a brief history of the archaeology findings in both Egypt and Bimini. The book by no means shed more light onto this mystery. The book must be read with an open mind especially when Edgar Cayce spoke of the origin of humankind, nevertheless, it is always interesting to read other peoples' philosophy on matter such as this. The later two elements of this book (Geology, Archaeology findings) makes it worthwhile to read. The Author in every why he could, attempted to use these findings/evidence to support Edgar Cayce's views, however, these findings/evidence by no means confirm nor deny the existence of Atlantis."
4,Great house shoe,"They look good and are very comfortable. The rubber treads are fine for most outdoor use too. The cigar-shoe-box is also pretty cool. They keep my feet warm and dry. The stitching is my only minor complaint. Nothing has come undone after a couple months of use but I can see what other reviewers are talking about, you can expect similar stitching quality on other moccasins though. They run a little big...I wear a 13 shoe but the 13 Castro is a little bit large - my heel slides out pretty easily but I'm fine with that indoors. I would suggest getting one (or half) size smaller than your normal shoe."
2,Torn after half and hour of wear,These shoes ripped where the tongue meets the side wall after normal wear of half an hour. Returned to Eastbay. Still working on refund. My son has a similar pair of globe shoes that ripped in the same spot after several months.
3,Rock Star,A great movie to watch with your other half! Jennifer Aniston plays a different role in this one and took me by surprise. Mark Wahlbeg's singing is amazing. Fun filled and takes you back to the good old days!
5,Rock Star Movie,"One of my FAVORITES! Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston were so great together. Being as my era was in the 80's, and listened to hair band music, this movie rocked. I recommend this to anyone."
4,"Get Cozy..Because ""This Is Entertainment""!","Ok....get the popcorn and beverages out..cause you're in for a treat...I'm not a heavy metal fan at all--but when the song "" Stand UP"" was on, I actually rewound the scene a few times and was singing along..and the plot keep me very interested. I was suprised at the intelligence of the story line. And yes, it is a ""lesson to be learned"" type movie. And what's wrong with that? Most movies now a days leave you with a sense of ""what a waste of time and money"". Mark Wahlberg was convincing to me for the RockStar part and showed a lot of guts to ""STAND UP"" to what he believed in. I saw the movie over again just for the music parts....I recommend it!"
1,ROCK BOMB,"This is another movie on the growing list of Mark Walhberg's terrible movies.In this one, tough, he is not the one to blame. The blame for this failure is clear at the hand of the screenplay and the director. It's obvius whatever wrote that does not like hard rock / heavy metal, or at least is full of prejudice for both of them. The history is full of cliches (bad ones - some times there good cliches to use in a film - but unfortunately that didn't happen here)and, worst than this, a lot of unbeliavable impossible situations. Examples:1) The new singer audition for the band (Steel Dragon) in front of the old singer, that simply does not know he is being fired!!2) The singer (Walhberg) and the guitarrist of his cover band start arguing in the middle of a show, talking normally as if the volume was turned to zero!3)The singer (Wahlberg) quit upon being a rocker and decide to go ""zen"", playing accoustic gigs in clubs with twenty people as audience.Well, enough. THis is just junk."
3,A wannabe you gets to be...,For every starving musician this is a very fun and interestng movie. The movie is about a guy who is kicked out of a band and gets a phone call from a member of the Steel Dragon Band to audition to replace their lead singer. This is unlikely in reality but it is fun to think of because what if you were called by your favorite band to come and play or sing for them? Would'nt it be great?! I like the fact that Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind is in the movie because he is a rock star in real life posing as one in the movie. I can't give this movie a comlete five stars because it is somewhat pointless here and there but it is a ton of fun!
4,Rock Star DVD,i like the movie and it was sent and received by me while stationed in Iraq in a timely manner. Thanks.Rock Star
5,Great movie for 80's generation!,Rockstar is hilarious and very entertaining. Me and all my friends absolutely love this movie! If you grew up during the 80's you will really appreciate this movie.
5,One of my favorites of 2001!!!!,"This movie is a must for your collection, especially if you're fan of BIG HAIR ROCK. I grew up with the type of music this film is based on. I thought Mark Wahlberg did an amazing job of capturing the essence of a Heavy Metal frontman. He had the perfect swagger and look. Even if you aren't a huge fan of Metal, I'm sure at one time you've fantasized about being a rock star or some type of entertainer, right? I'm sure you'll be able to relate to the story of a guy who sings for a tribute band of his heroes, eventually getting the call to front the ACTUAL band. Jennifer Aniston and the cast of real life rockers like guitarist Zakk Wylde and Third Eye Blind's Stephan Jenkins are all great too. Oh and by the way... the soundtrack CD is also excellent, with original music from the film's band, Steel Dragon and classics from KISS, Bon Jovi and others. For a fun film ride I enthusiastically recommend ROCK STAR! Enjoy!!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I have been an electric shaver user for decades. Since my Norelco seems to be dying, I decided to try this one because it got good reviews. It is the worst of any of the shavers that I have ever owned. It is slow, misses hairs on every shave, and has irritated my skin in a way no shaver has ever done. I am going back to Norelco.Braun does make a good electric toothbrush."
4,The Braun 1775,Received it today and tried it out once it had a full charge. The shave was equal to my old Remington Micro Screen 3 1000 which gave me a shave almost the equal to a blade. For the money it's the best electric shaver out their and superior to Brauns 7526 which I was very dissatisfied with.
1,Not what I expected..........,"I purchased the #1775 with high expectations. I was really disapointed. I still have my first basic Braun shaver from at least 20 years ago, and it shaves 10 times better than the #1775. Plus my old shaver has never had the blades sharpened! When using the #1775, it reminds me of a lawnmower when it goes through very thick grass. It makes a loud noise and the motor even bogs down. After 4 weeks, I still can't get a close shave. I sincerely DON'T recomend this shaver."
4,VERY PLEASED,FOR THE PRICE IT GAVE ME A NICE CLEAN SHAVE.THE CORD/CORDLESS FEATUREIS A PLUS WITH THE 5 MINUTE RECHARGE.
3,"Worth the price, but thats about all","I had heard a lot about this shaver, and I figured for $30 I couldn't go wrong. And, I got a $30 shaver. It's ok, but not as good as everyone rated it. I have always gotten a Remington micro-screen in the past, and I wished I had this time. It shaves, but I could get a quicker and closer shave with a blade. It cuts the whiskers, but only after you go over your face several times in the same place."
4,Nice Shaver,"I have always used Norelco rotary razors and this is my first Braun. This razor has received numerous positive reviews so I thought what the heck I will try something different. It has not disappointed me. It does not pull or grab like the rotary razors and gives a nice shave. I don't care what people or manufacturers say, an electric razor will NOT shave as close as a straight razor. Do not buy into that hype!!! I don't think the high dollar razors are worth their asking price. You are just paying for features. For the money you will be disappointed with this Braun. Recommended!"
5,Great electric shaver!,"I'm very happy with this shaver. It cuts nice and close (though I'm only using it on my neck and upper cheeks at this time, because I have a beard). It's also easy to clean - just run the shaving end under hot water! It's a lot quieter than my old Braun, and you can't beat the price. I highly recommend it."
1,Braun shaver does not work.,It does not work well ay all. I would like to return it - please advise.
1,Still waiting on product,Never received the product I ordered. I received the wrong razor at first. It was sent back and I still have not received the original one that I ordered. Will not do business with this company ever again. I hope when I receive my credit card statementThat I have been credited for the item. Worse experience I have had trying to deal with a company.
3,"Decent razor, with caveats","Overall, this is a good razor- for the price.Couple of things to bear in mind. I am a light-bearded person who always follows an electric shave with a razor blade. While the quality of the cut is fine, it is hyberbole to suggest this 'cuts like a blade'.Another thing to bear in mind: when held level (much less upside down) the clippings slowly & steadily drip out. In practical terms, this means the product requires frequent washing. I would not recommend this for use in a car, for this reason.After several months, the product seems to retain a reasonable charge after several weeks of daily use."
1,Fancy face tickler,"I've to say that I'm horribly disappointed about this shaver. My facial hair is pretty thick and I mean the width of each hair, not volume-wise. Apparently unless your facial hair fits in the tiny mesh, all you'll get is an expensive face tickler. It literally shaved zero of my facial hairs. Tried going with and against the grain (always perpendicular to the surface as per manual) but that made very little difference. Had to go back to my old, trusty (but painful) razor.I have to give 1 star because at least to me it was entirely useless. So beware: if you facial hair is pretty thick and wiry, this will not work for you."
4,Better than my old Norelco,"I picked this up on clearance for under $30 and I find that after three weeks I get a good, close shave. Easy cleaning and the ability to shave plugged in make this a steal."
2,Disappointing. Repeated passes required for close shave,"I'm surprised at all the positive reviews here. I bought this razor mainly based on the reviews, and I must say that I'm disappointed. My previous electric razor was a low-end Remington that I bought from a discount retailer. But the Remington shaver actually worked much better, and I shouldn't have thrown it away when the foil broke.The problem with this Braun shaver is that you have to keep shaving the same spot -- over and over and over again -- in order to get a close shave. If you do a quick, two-minute shave (which actually worked pretty well with my Remington), you'll end up with about as much beard as you had before the shave.I don't recommend this shaver."
3,Its just OK,"I'm not real hsppy with this seller because of a DVD I ordered at about the same time. This board worked Ok, and that is all I expected from it. Its not a great product to start with. You get what you pay for with these items"
4,Mr. Stinky Feet's Christmas,"Gave it as a gift and response was great. Many other music CD's purchased for children have been pretty awful. Many times it's the quality of the recording, vocals difficult to hear or understand, but that was not a problem with Mr. Skinky Feet."
2,"too much, too fast","As a beginner, I found the first ten pages of this book interesting and helpful, but after that it gets complex fast. The enclosed CD is pointless, except for the tuning, and even then you have to wait a few minutes while the artists in the studio get some foolishness out of the way. There are 7 or 8 songs that follow, but no connection with the book or guidance on how to play. I'll get back to it in about a year, but this is no value for absolute beginners."
2,"Too Much King Britt, Not Enough Sister Morgan","I have nothing against slunky electric guitar, but the title says ""King Britt Presents: Sister Gertrude Morgan"". But where is she? Wait! There! I think I heard a little bit! King Britt says he loves Sister Gertrude Morgan's voice, then he proceeds to bury it on these recordings. Search ""Let's Make a Record"" on Amazon to find the original Sister Gertrude Morgan and her tambourine. Buy both of these records if you want to, but don't buy just the ""King Britt Presents"", because that's NOT Sister Morgan. ""Let's Make a Record"" is the genuine article."
4,They work.,I actually thought they were going to be white as in the picture than multi color with pet ears on it and paw print.
2,They don't fit regular cans from other brands.,"Pet Food Can CoversI think the quality of these lids is good, but they don't fit Fancy Feast cans."
3,Hoping for more,"Well, I downloaded this episode hoping to see myself in it. NBC cancelled the show and switched the air times, so I missed this one. I was also hoping to see myself, they cut me out completely. Jimmy Smits was a very nice guy though. He even stood in line to eat just like everyone else. I wish this show would have gotten a chance to bud an audience. This episode wasn't bad. I am just upset I was not in the final cut. The courtroom was very wam with the lights. And it was 90 degrees plus that day. The life of an actor. I miss this show."
2,Ludlam in training,"Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping."
3,Wonderful premises let down by poor scripting,"An ancient artefact containing ... what (I won't spoil the joy for readers)? The story began with a tantalising pre-historic sequence of how the artefact was buried with an ancient king but then left the readers with no further 'retrospective' of how the artefact was used (or otherwise ravaged) the ancient world. Cut to the present, the reader is then confronted with huge chunks of irrelevant rivalry amongst academic-types, including a Greek archaeologist unfortunately miscast in an MCP role. All very well but handled badly and detracting seriously from the implications of the Artefact on human history. A wonderful premise by a brilliant author, but needs to be reworked drastically."
2,Quasi SF,"The reason that I read books that are described as ""science fiction"" is, ultimately, for the science fiction. I assume I will be immersed in a world with some kind of unique take on the laws of physics, society, or reality itself. Technically speaking, ""Artifact"" fulfills those requirements, though it does so in a fairly tedious and uninteresting way.I can only assume Mr. Benford's publisher is telling their authors to ""do something Crichtonesque.""If you are the type of reader who is often confused and bewildered by new ideas, you may enjoy this book. However, if ""normalist"" SF is really what you're looking for, a much more fulfilling read is Greg Bear's ""Darwin's Radio."""
4,Coulnd't put it down,"I picked up a copy of Artifact because I didn't want to spend $28.00 on Benford's new novel (the paperback will be out soon, right?). I made a good choice. Solid science, wonderful characters, and a twisty, engaging story ... altogether, one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. I'm going to the bookstore today to find another Benford novel. Hell, I might even spend the $28.00 bucks for the hardback!"
3,Cupcakes better when not smooshed!,"The product itself was excellent, but the packaging was not. It came in a flat rate large letter envelope. Needless to say, the cupcakes were very flat when we got them. We ate the cupcakes, which were delicious; but they would have been better if not smashed."
2,Decide not to use it,"I did not read other people's reviews carefully before I made purchase since this flux is acid which requires good clean; more importance, it contains Zinc Chloride which causes Asthma. I tried it once, soldering is fine except too big drop of it from needle bottle. Maybe brush will work better. I decided not to use it anymore and purchased no-clean flux pen instead on Amazon."
1,incomplete product,"The book is missing 3 out of 4 audio text exams. This is really bad, my wife has the exam in 1,5 weeks and there is no way to know if she is ready for the exam or has to study more.There is no way to get additional test exams in time from other sources. We also complained at the website of the publisher, but didn't get any reply from that.You better go look for another book."
5,Yummy!,My husband loves this flavor of berry. He loves all pop-tarts but these are hands down the favorites. I order by the case from Amazon as they are hard to get locally.
5,Jimmy Scott the Originator,"Want to know who inspired Nancy Wilson and many more Jazz Singers, it's Jimmy Scott. This CD showcases Jimmy at his best."
4,A great surprise from TCM,"I saw this movie last year con TCM And I was greatly surprised! It is one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen. The acting was so natural, a movie very well done, and still with the innocence of the 60's... I loved it!"
1,Poor copies NOT originals,"I was so looking forward to getting this CD, but when it arrived, it quickly became eveident that I had allowed myself to be suckered. Despite being billed as various artists (therefore one would rightly assume the originals) this is a cheap copy featuring 'the Hit Crew'. Suffice to say, I doubt this crew has ever had a hit and never will. IMO: The copies contained on this CD are lame, compared to the originals. DON'T BUY!!"
5,Jane Olivor,Jane Olivor is the best kept secret in the music industry. A voice that surpasses Barbra Streisand. Unbelievably beautiful. This is music to fall in love to.
3,Reasonably good book but amateurishly produced,"Reasonably good book, but flawed by annoying typos and bad editing. The book looks very much like a self-published one, and suffers from it. Also, the book is long on anecdotes, but short on specific details about its subject matter. For example, for a book called a ""Ghost Hunter's Guide,"" it really never gives beginners a step by step guide to how to hunt ghosts. It is very good on the history of spiritualism, but light on much of what someone really interested in hunting ghosts would be looking for. (For that, I'd recommend Joshua Warren's How To Hunt Ghosts.) However, this book would make a good addition to someone's library on this subject."
4,good..but where was the editor??,"I am in the middle of this book, and I am enjoying it so far. The author provides a lot of information and history on parapsychology and Spiritualism. The only problem I have with this book is the editing; tons of errors!"
5,One of the best books ever!,"I am normally not one for reading but this book is so interesting that I could hardly put it down! Very informative and doesn't try to say that his way is the only way and he isn't afraid of saying that his previous versions of this book and opinions have changed! The book has a few editing problems and he tends to refer to the ghost hunter as a he, but other than that a GREAT book!!!"
3,Loss of Focus,"The authors started with a good idea, that is, to put the Alamo into a context, both before and after the Battle. However, they lost focus and gave us far more about Mexican history, John Wayne's Alamo, Disney's Davy Crockett, and the women protecting the Alamo heritage than they did about the battle. Although the authors write well and seemed reliable, it ultimately seemed like they were telling us more about how Mrs. Lincoln liked the play than about the central event."
2,Typical Santa Anna and Mexican stereotypes revisited,"I was assigned to read Line in the Sand for a graduate class and unfortunately it quickly turned sour. It read like a W.P.Webb history book of the 1950's where Mexicans are blood thirsty and Santa Anna is compared to Cortez himself. There is little of nothing this book can offer a Tejano historian, it is just a another book insulting Mexicans and letting us all know how great the defenders of the Alamo were."
2,75% fat,"Most of this book is wasted on pointless anecdotes with filmmakers who forgot the purpose of the interview: to describe how their first film got made.The best interviews are the first and last: the Coen brothers and James Mangold. Allison Anders comes across as very sweet and smart. Steve Buscemi's story is interesting IF you've seen Trees Lounge.The rest of the interviews fall flat. I had no idea what Bertrand Tavernier was talking about. Or Gary Oldman. Or Mike Figgis, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach...Save your money and read those ""FamousDirector on FamousDirector"" books instead."
2,It was not what I was looking for,I am sure the book is fine but it turned out to not be what I was looking for. Sorry
1,"Gloster, La.",Does not iron well at all. Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material
1,Dreadful sequel,"This ""plotless"", totally contrived film has none of the humour, theme, or charm of the Trouble with Angels. It is a mindless string of 1960s cliches, with the acting poor and the script worse.Of course, if your sole reason for purchasing videos is that there is no sex or violence - yes, you can watch this with the children. However, if they are past pre-school age, it will not be intelligent or mature enough for them."
2,Embarrassing!,"This is one of those movies you watch in disbelief because it is SO bad! An obvious attempt to recapture the magic of ""Trouble with Angels"", this fails miserably! I think the producers cast Stella Stevens as the progressive nun because they couldn't get Hayley Mills to star in this pathetic sequel! Stella's character is not even really likable or warm for a nun - she's just angry! Rosalind Russell still has some appeal, but all the rest of the cast are cliches from the Mills ""Angel"" film. Even some of the dialogue sounds like it was lifted! Really a shame, since the first film was so good."
2,Bummer,"If there's such a thing as a complete waist of film, this is a good example of one. Unlike the smashing hit The Trouble With Angels, this pointless sequel definetely isn't worth watching. This movie captures none of the charm or entertainment of its proceder. Just because its considered the sequel to the first production with Hayley Mills, don't let that fool you. It's bad."
4,Roz does it again...,"I'm also a fan of the original ""Trouble with Angels,"" but it's the sequel that has always held a very special place in my heart. Capturing all of the spirit of its predecessor, ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows"" uses words and honest, intelligent dialogue to convey its ideas whereas ""The Trouble with Angels"" used simpler, albeit charming, images.The conflict of of this sequel is between far more than the simple students vs. teachers dynamic of the original. In ""Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows,"" the entire institution of the convent, its inhabitants, and its ideals are explored. Rosalind Russel snaps perfectly in this role and the surface challenges of a mere cross country bus ride mirror her own challenges with new ideas and opposing philosophies. And, yes, there are plenty of antics!A retinue of supporting cameos only enhance what is, for me, a truly special and touching movie experience."
4,Strategic ideas for internediate players,"This book explains many important middlegame themes like superiority in wings, queenside attacks, minority attack, open files etc. It does not show only finding the weaknesses of your opponent but also how to exploit them. Good for intermediate players."
3,Technical and outdated,"There's a newer version of this book but it's unavailable on amazon (only through the publisher). Unfortunately, the book is very technical and only of limited use to radio control hobbyists. At that, it's not very well written. For example, the author never defines the term ""volt"" either in the text or in the glossary. He lamely defines volt in the glossary in the old analogy of water pressure from a garden hose. What?It's too bad because the author knows his subject inside and out--he just writes and explains poorly. The book is in serious need of a technical editor."
2,Poor quality,"This dresser looks nice, but it is of poor quality. The drawers do not hold much weight and the piece holding the drawers keeps coming off. I quess you get what you pay for."
2,NOT THE BEST QUALITY,"LOOKS GOOD FOR THE PRICE, BUT THE DRAWER GLIDES WERE MADE OF PLASTIC AND IF NOT ON SOLID FLOOR IT HAS TO BE MOUNTED TO WALL. WOULD RECAMEND IF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING CHEAP, BUT NOT FOR A LOT OF USE."
4,Great purchase,"This item was easy to put together and pleasant to look at. For the price, it was a great purchase."
4,Depression Era films,"If you like 30's type films, this is for you. We bought this to teach my 13 yo about the Depression and it's a powerful teaching tool. There are a number of films on the disc many of them famous, a few not so famous but they all capture the Depression through fine story telling and acting. The first film had real controversy attached to it."
5,High quality overview of the basic ideas everyone working on wireline communication IC design should know,"If you appreciate Dr. Razavi's renowned book CMOS Analog IC Design, then this book won't disappoint you since it has the same quality: brevity and clarity of explanations of what matters, clear figures and good organization. Except for a part of the PLL chapter (ch. 8) which copies from his other books, most of the book is original text which summarizes knowledge which would take much more time to gain by simply reading papers or looking at other people's design at random. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Dr. Razavi's style in his CMOS Analog IC design book and who works in the wireline communication IC design industry."
4,Great Scent,"This is my husband's absolute favorite cologne. It has a masculine, yet light smell. It's great for people who don't like the heavy musk of most men's colognes."
1,Givenchy gentleman,This is obviously not my cutest perfume. Will not use again. Smell is not so impressive. I'm disappointed against all comments I read prior to buying!!!
1,Echo Monster,This item is exactly what I was afraid of - an echo machine. Really bad feedback. Save your money and get a wireless headset instead. I have heard good things about the BlueAnt which is a lot more expensive. You get what you pay for in this case. POS.
1,Tekkeon ET6000 Handsfree - Don't Buy,"I tried to use the product with the LG8300 phone. It was unusable. The party I was talking to heard themselves loudly echo back to them. I called Tekkeon Technical service and they suggested that I try lowering the volume, completely reseting the unit and ""remarrying"" or check with my cellular provider for a fix. If nothing else worked to return it. Nothing worked and I returned the unit."
5,absolute must,can't emphasize it enough--plenty of derm boards fodder contained in this text. extremely high yield. a much easier read than fitzpatrick.
4,Low fat doesn't mean precarious.....,"I remember that these bad boys saved my life at a job I use to have. I would throw a couple of these Pop Tarts in the toaster and enjoy with a cup of coffee. I must say that they held me over very well until lunch time.Or under the assumption I didn't have time for lunch because my former job was known for not letting an easy going guy like myself have the ability to go to lunch, despite my high production and charismatic personality. I guess that is why I don't work there anymore.I digress, these Pop Tarts are really good and they don't taste low fat at all. The bold flavor of brown sugar and cinnamon burst from these Pop Tarts like a banshee's guffaws after Halloween is over. This treat is an exquisite pastry the can be served like beignets in The French Quarter.I will stop with the metaphors this really is a great product."
3,Not recommended for all.,"Overall, I found this book jam packed with a little bit of info on every topic necessary but I felt like it spent more time DESCRIBING the features and EXPLAINING WHY they were important instead of giving HANDS-ON INSTRUCTIONS. The book called ""Quick Course in Microsoft Publisher 2000"" by Joyce Cox and Christina Dudley (ISBN: 1582780072) was more helpful for me. I acknowledge that each person has a different style of learning. If you need specific hands-on instruction, go with Quick Course. If you need to understand the big picture first, go with the Dummies book. Good luck!"
4,great tent,very good tent very compact and will buy again if needed looked at army navy store but cost way too much
4,Good for the price,"This is a very good tent for the price. Very easy to set up, surprisingly sturdy in the wind, and enough room to sleep and store gear. I did notice a little condensation in the morning but its backpacking...i got over it. The ventilation is a little lacking so just put it in the shade and you'll be golden with the heat. This is not a fantastic tent in general but its cheap and its light so win win (thus the 4 stars). Happy packing!"
4,New York Matters,"Crane has a delightfully light style of writing that can take the deepest and most sorrowful of situations, and somehow bring them light. His, ""Maggie: A Girl of the Streets,"" is a wonderful depiction of life for a 19th century girl in New York. ""The Open Boat"" puts you on the ship; you can naturally feel the narration and flow with him as he crashes against the waves. A wonderful read for any interested in American or New York literature."
1,Amazing story TERRIBLE digital copy,"I love Stephen Crane and I love my Kindle, however... the digital copy of this book is riddled with typos, missing paragraphs, and even missing pages. I recommend reading the story, or perhaps even buying the phsyical book. But stay away from this digital copy."
1,Waste of money,"This is an extremely poor product. Do not purchase if you care at all about the information you're storing on the drive. Our company purchased 7 last year to help back up other drives and free up space on our server. Now 2 sound like they're on their last leg. These drives were not being used as a primary storage system thankfully. While used infrequently, they still manage to sound as if we just asked them to run a marathon. They wheeze, whine, and are exceptionally slow. I don't trust it and have stopped using the drive."
4,"A girl, A mech, An Android, and a little puppy",Galaxy Fraulein yuna is by far one of the most funny anime OAV's i have ever seen from the opening theme to the final words it is laugh after laugh. I reccomend this OAV to any Otaku.
1,First Use a Bust!,"The first time we used this to recharge a camera battery on the go, the battery swelled up and is now useless. $40 for battery plus the cost of the charger down the drain. We are afraid to use this charger again and ruin another battery."
2,Frail!,"The first time I bought this camera, the zoom spoilt after a short while. I was disappointed but then bought the 10MP of Kodak. I think thats their best so far. This camera is problem prone!"
1,Trouble from the start,"This BRAND NEW Channel Master 9521A antenna rotor wasted my whole day. I have a backround in electronics. Hooked it up on the ground, went about 1/3 way around then bound up! Opened it up, main gear jumped several teeth. Realigned, same thing again. Degree reading a joke! No sync, runs off with each movement. An $89 piece of junk! I am sure some of these work, but quality is poor. Drive motor of cheapest quality. Read other reviews on this & you will probably forget it. Some other brands have complaints too. Read reviews before you buy. I took apart my 30 year old Alliance Tennarotor (still working) re-lubricated it & put it back up. Works perfectly. Always stops exactly where you set it!"
2,NOT SUITED FOR COLD WEATHER,"I installed this unit atop a 10ft mast mounted to my home. From there I used a 3ft extension pole to mount a 2.4ghz wire mesh antenna (far smaller and lighter than a UHF TV type antenna).The unit was simple enough to install - hookup was easy. The degree indicator is ""fairly"" accurate I'd say repeatable within 1 to 3 degrees. Everything was great UNTIL the first winter came along.ANYTIME its freezing or colder out (32F) the unit simply won't work! I'm not talking freezing rain or anything I'm simply saying if its COLD this thing won't work! If you live in a region that has a cold winter season DO NOT BUY this product. I thought maybe moving the rotor full sweep everyday would prevent lock ups... WRONG.Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere - this product IS NOT reliable in cold weather and it's certainly not worth the price. This product has permanently tarnished my opinion of the Channel Master brand name."
3,Wheres DEAD ALREADY? (aka the falling steaks around Alex),The sound track is really interesting but it is a shame that DEAD ALREADY from the American Beauty soundtrack isn't on there.
3,Like the music,"If you like this movie you will enjoy the cd. My family and I like to listen to this cd in the car or at home, it has some fine music that we really enjoy."
3,Dino's Swinging Debut as Matt Helm,"The first and best of the Matt Helm spy spoofs. Dean Martin has a swinging good time in ""The Silencers"" while making more money than Sean Connery's superior 007. (Dino's production company had a piece of the action.) Efficiently directed by Phil Karlson, with Stella Stevens in one of her better roles. Don't miss the hilarious dig at Frank Sinatra."
5,Beautiful!,"The necklace is stunning once it's out of the package...the pearls on mine are more white than cream (shown in the picture) but still gorgeous nonetheless. The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed. Delivery was unexpectedly fast. It was definitely worth the money."
5,Pretty little pouch,This is a great pouch! It has a silky feel. I bought it to hold my rough rose quartz. You'll like this little pouch!
4,"Not a bad time travel story even if it is a bit ""played out""","Different versions of the ""evil scientist"" antagonist are traveling through time doing both evil and good, trying to both harm and to protect. It is up to Kirk & Co. (mostly Spock) to set things right. Although there are some problems with the story - most notably a bad characterization of Mr. Scott (I doubt he would be so quick to take sides against Kirk & Co.) - it does have its moments. In particular, the interplay between Spock and McCoy, the subplot involving Mr. Sulu, the characterizations of the security personnel and the Captain Hunter character."
2,"buy one with a jam release, not this one","Have used this 5x, the first 3x no problems and than it began to eat my documents.Which was very frustrating, and it smokes. The last straw was when it ate my Flat Pepper, and in frustration, I had to take the machine apart in order to get it out. Easy to take apart and put back together, and get it to work,Best advice buy a laminator that has a jam release!"
2,Not very good at all,I got this unit cheap. $150 for a 80gb + DVD Burner. Sounds good. But you DO get what you pay for. I have a JVC that cost me $400 and it has a 160GB harddrive and DVD Burner and it's Much better than this unit. It's hard to program and the killer part is it LOSES programs that was recorded!!!! This is not reliable at all. I have missed so many ending to shows it's not even funny any more. It's so upsetting to watch 50min of a hour long show and miss the ending/punchline/outcome. I would give it 1 star if not for the price.
2,Unreliable and disappointing,"I should have known better than to buy another Philips DVDR after all the problems I had with my first one. Color me stupid, I guess.The first program I recorded on the HD ended up getting corrupted. Unfortunately, that was a continuing trend. The software tends to crash, and the only way to reset is to unplug it, which would often result in more corrupted files.To be honest, I only had one problem with the timer, and that was remedied by reseting the software to defaults.The DVD burner worked fine at first, but know it won't even read half the disks I have, even disks it burned itself.I've only had it six months, and I'm already looking to replace it. I expected more from a 400-dollar piece of equipment. My 50-dollar off-brand VCR has outlasted not one but TWO Philips DVDRs. That can't be good."
5,Mood Indigo is my favorite book!,"Mood Indigo is my favorite book. The writing is excellent.Mood Indigo is brilliant; it kept me guessing ""who did it"" until the end. Usually in mystery books I can tell right off the bat who the killer is. But not this time. And usually I can say at least one thing I didn't like about a book. But not this time.I highly recommend Mood Indigo to anyone who wants to read a mystery with exceptional characters in a time before the internet and cell phones. I guarantee you will not be disappointment.Charlotte Vale Allen has written many books, all different, and Mood Indigo is no exception. She makes you care about the characters.Mood Indigo is a must read for mystery buffs. Once you've read the book you will see why it's my all-time favorite book."
3,Good product,"Performance is ok. It has begun to collapse after a couple of months - nothing spectacular to report, but then again nothing really negative."
1,A Worthless Buy,If you don't have to purchase this book for your college software engineering classes then please save your cash. This book is the absolute worst. After reading this book and completing the exercises for my classes you will change your mind about being a software engineer.
2,"Very Dry, lacks major examples","The book is extremely dry and is very wordy. There is a lot of information present and the subject is rather dry to begin with, but this book still falls short. It also lacks examples of major documentation (requirements definition, requirements specifcation, etc.)"
4,BOWIE? FLOYD? ZEPPELIN?,Suffffraggettte City was barely in the movie...BUT I LOVE IT! and a Pink Floyd cover? Have you heard such a thing? Please. WHERE WAS SOME LED ZEPPELIN...Whole Lotta Love would have kicked this movie up a notch and the soundtrack...Jimi is saweeet! Let me stand next to your FIRE!
5,AMAZING!,"I have no clue about the ""history"" of skateboarding and will learn more after this movie.I've always enjoyed watching surfing and skateboarding..it does take allot to stand atop a piece of whatever and it's all physics that you remain there...BUT add to it some crazy kids, allot of fun and you have a wonderful way to take a kid and let him have fun and TALENT!...there's so little of this in our society today..a computer or gaming is not even a close second choice....Heath is always amazing and he does it again in this movie..the boys/guys in the movie are also great...the MUSIC adds to the entire movie...this is NOT taken from a MARVEL COMIC BOOK...you getting your A** out there and proving that you are good..."
3,A Cool Soundtrack To An Alright Movie.,"This is a cool soundtrack to a pretty descent movie. My favorite songs on it areBlack Sabbath ""Paranoid"" and Social Distortion ""Death or Glory"" (a Clash cover song)"
2,Massive flaw,"I imagine the people giving this product glowing reviews haven't run out of their first ink, or if they have, they had spare ink all good to go. Listen up: if this printer is out of ANY ink the unit won't print. Even if you're out of yellow and you want to print in MONO, and set it to the MONOCHROME setting, it won't print AT ALL. Now that's just plain rude! This is just so great if you get caught short at midnight with a report to print. Puh-lease. I've had it - this thing is only three months old but off to the auction site it goes."
1,very strong warning :(,"please search and read ""bug"" information online and take the information seriouslyworks well at firstI have owned mine for five months and have only used it to print several pages a day or soalignment and function button problems begin that cannot be correctedI repeat- please search and read ""bug"" information online!this printer has become useless to meI'm replacing it and hoping for a refund from the company"
2,"Usable, but not necessary","This is nothing but a one inch wide piece of bent metal with a hooked tab in the end. From all appearances this tool should work like a charm to separate the overlapped latches on vinyl siding, but for some reason it just doesn't. It's difficult to tell if you have the tool positively engaged on the strip, and when you think that you do, and give it a downward pull, it slips off of the latch. I found it faster and easier to remove the siding using a long handled screwdriver inserted between the overlaps and prying downward to disengage the latch. There may be some tight spots where this tool might come in handy, but I never found any real use for it on my project."
1,book has been reissued after his predictions failed to come true,"What do I say. This guy is a hoax, multiple issues of the same book changing his people and predictions as they prove false. How can you write a book and then change the info as they prove false? Also his translations of latin are completely false and serve his own purpose. Good job making up things as you need. DO some research and do not buy this guys box full of &*^$"
3,Not bad,"I picked up this book knowing very little backround of Nostradamus or his language. That being said, I had to rely on all the actual English. Basically, Big Mr. N has had tons of bunk prophecies and a few that hit the bulls-eye in a way that's hard to deny. The author rambles on occasionaly, giving us his opinion of decoding big N's quatraints, but fails to impress. If anyone is actually looking for predictions that are YET to come, do not waste your time- anywhere. These prophecies I doubt will ever be able to be deciphered so as to predict a coming event."
4,Finland - in a nutshell,"This book provides a brief, but very comprehensive, history of Finland from the bronze age to the twentieth century. I found the extensive details on the early history of Swedish-Finnish expansion extremely helpful, although the book is a bit skimpy on the topic of the Finnish civil war. The book rightfully calls itself a ""short"" history, but it's a satisfying overview."
2,I thought it would be nicer,"I expected more from Electrolux Eureka, but at $101.00 maybe I got what I paid for.Negatives- The machine is too noisy and generates heat so that the carrying handle gets hot. The metal adjustable wand is heavy compared to my old plastic non adjustable wand, so I continue to use the old one. The floor brush has an awkward feeling which I do not like, so I continue to use an old one I have.Positives- I like the light hose, the HEPA filter and the strong suction. Changing regular filter and HEPA are convenient. Machine is compact, good wheels, on-off switch and extra attachments are good enough."
2,Vacuum cleaner review,"I thought I had done a good job researching vacuum cleaners when I bought this one, but I was wrong in the fact I thought this was a carpet cleaner. This has no rotating brushes of any kind, so all it really does is pick up stuff off the surface of things. It is great on hardwood floors and maybe some flat rugs but not carpet. This did not work well at all on my carpet. I went back with another vacuum after using this to find so much it missed. It is just a suction hose and you have to get the hole right over the obect to pick it up, and if it has any attachment to the floor bend down and pick it up release it then see if it will pick it up. If it has any weight forget it. I have to go and buy something else. I don't have the money to do this, so if you don't either don't waste your time."
1,"Poor suction, big disappointment","I don't understand why this machine is rated ""commercial"" - it is TINY, the suction is terrible, and the floor attachment is difficult to manuever. The ""bare floors to carpet"" option is a joke - it's impossible to push on carpet; the small fibers on the attachment grip the carpet and don't allow it to move! I bought it to use in my retail store space and returned it after one use. We have old hardwood floors that we clean pretty regularly but had hitherto only swept. I expected a commercial vacuum to provide some power but this one failed big time - I had to move very slowly and go back and forth repeatedly to pick up dust bunnies that any household vacuum would grab the first time. I would have been better off getting a Shop-Vac for around $20."
4,Good Vac with Loud noise,Small convienient Vacuum with loud noise. I use it in my house not for commercial use. I would say a good quality product. I have used it for 3 weeks now and so far so good.
4,great little sucker,"First of all, this little vacuum really does have powerful suction. It's great for small areas and for doing around the edges of our floors. The issue I have with it is that the tube attachments are very narrow and get plugged almost every time I use the vacuum. I have to say, though, that we have 3 cats and 2 dogs so our house is a giant hairball. When all that hair is sucked up the vac, along with any slightly larger pieces of Stuff, it immediately clogs the tube. So far, it's been easy to clean out--just thump it on the edge of the wastebasket and poke it out with a screwdriver. I still like the vac, other than this one irritation."
5,Just get one !,"Bought this vacuum a couple of years ago and it is still working its tail off. We have 4 cats and 1 dog, so you know that there is hair balls. Can not say anything but the best about this vac. If there is an allergy problem get the HEPA filter, its works great to!"
5,very pleased,i enjoyed thise cd plus the other three cds iplayed them all excepted the last three of glen gould i will play these three newyears nite i love playing them sunday nights with wine i am very pleased.
1,Who edited this?,"I bought this at a used book store for a buck; and that goes to show that you get what you pay for. I, too, went through the book with a red pen and edited the misspellings, fractured usage and ambiguous sentences. The editing disasters were so egregious that it took away from a relatively interesting story. How did this ever get published in the first place?"
3,"Not Much Of A ""Toy"", But Still Cool","I don't use this much as actual pen, but I've taken it appart and put it together dozens of times and never had a problem with is falling apart. It handles ok while writing as well."
2,Not what I thought,I bought these as gifts for my boys 7 and 8. They weren't very fun. They boys didn't play with them or use them much at all. I thought they would be more interactive but it is not. Not worth the money in my opinion.
2,Lego Pen,Nice novelty idea for a gift but probably wouldn't purchase another one- not very durable and my 3 and 5 yr old haven't played w/ it very much- the top lego bead does not stay on very well nor does one of the arms on R2D2- the lego beads will probably go missing w/in weeks if the kids start to really take interest in the pen.
4,Enjoyable,"I was five years old when The Beatles played for the first time in the U.S. but I remember lots of things about them during my childhood. I thought this book was objective and that Cynthia was generous and gracious to a fault to people who had been very unkind to her. I enjoyed reading about their lives and the history of how The Beatles started up. At the end of the book, I am astonished at what appears to be Yoko Ono's incredible controlling, ruthless persona, her insensitivity to John's other side of the family, combined with her greed and stinginess. Still, Cynthia doesn't appear judgmental when she reveals information - she just reports the facts. The facts judge Yoko for themselves. I felt sorry for John when the book was over, because under the influence of drugs and Yoko, he apparently was manipulated and changed for the worse."
2,Clueless,"This book was more interesting to me as a psychological portrait of Cynthia than as a story about John. How could a woman from a seemingly solid, loving family make such a hash of her life? John hit her, cheated on her, took a ten-day vacation in Spain and left her at home with a newborn baby, traded in her car, hired a friend to follow her and possibly entrap her in adultery, and still she wanted a relationship with him? She follows this folly by marrying a succession of men who are probably after the fortune they assume she has. Then she opens a bistro and hires a mentally ill friend as a staffer. She plans a memorial concert (why??? after all JL did to harm her and her son???) but then spoils it by telling her archenemy and known snake about it. Can anyone really be that naive? It's a fascinating inside view of one woman's denial of the reality staring her in the face. The factual errors only add to the sense that we're getting a dishonest and distorted story."
5,compelling story,"I've read a few books on John but this one has got to be the best. It really let you see what the early days were like from Cynthia's perspective. As for John, well I'll say this: I'm a huge Lennon fan from the time I was a kid. He was the coolest, the best singer, the funniest, I wept at his memorial in Central Park. But without reading biographies just the fact that it was publicly known he didn't treat Julian so well, I realized at a young age that the message and the actions were a contradiction. Kind of a disappointment but none the less my fault for not realizing artists are human--not the icons we make them out to be. So although it is a sad story of what John was going through (let's face it he had some baggage) no one can deny he was a talented, fantastic, charismatic musician."
4,"Builds on scientific principles, includes audio","Many video compression books start with a particular specification and then provide background to justify the decisions made in defining the specification. This book approaches video compression starting from scientific principles and building on those towards describing the decisions made in digital compression standards. It describes the history of common analog video formats and proceeds to a solid overview of the MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4 digital video compression formats.Many video compression books completely disregard or gloss over audio. This one includes audio compression with the same complete treatment given to video. The book covers MPEG layer 1-3 audio, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 AAC, and Dolby AC-3.This book is complete, has no obvious typos, is logically organized, and contains many useful diagrams."
3,"Well Written; Good (Not Great), Clean Mystery","Just finished this book and found it rather mediocre for my taste. If you are looking for a thriller/mystery, this is not it. For me, it wasn't one of those books that keep drawing you back to keep reading and put off everything else. Would I recommend to a friend? Probably not. Prior to this book I finished the final series of P.B. Ryan's Nell Sweeney mysteries; now those kept me from doing what I was supposed to be doing!"
3,Historical pioneer mystery,I liked the characters but it moved a little slowly. Don't think I'll go looking for a sequel.I did like the family dynamics.
5,EXCELLENT!,"All I can say is that this book is exellent. I have been looking and looking for a book that not only tells you how to read to your children but gives you suggestions of good books to read to them. This is that book!!! I got it from my local library but love it so much I am now going to buy it. It is a must read for any mother or new daycare teacher who, like me, had no clue about how to select a good book."
2,Too little action,"Too little action and the Mech which the Hero(Mechwarrior Zane) pilots seemed like invincible with more armour than a Daishi. Also, how can a mech with a single PPC destroy so many others mech. Very little information about Clan Nova Cats and too much internal thinking and dialogue. I can't say this for other readers, but for me, it ain't tensing enough."
3,"Good, but not good enough.","I have been a Battletech fan and player for almost a decade and have been following the product line's constant degeneration for many years. I thought the Battletech universe was lost after the infamous hidden designs were no longer available to us and Stackpole and Nystul left the team. This book provides a very small glimmer of hope... While the novel's characters lack the depth we're used to from a Stackpole story, the combat scenes aren't quite so deficiant. Additionally, I must admit that the book took a turn that I never would have anticipated. All in all, I think this Bills guy is a pretty good Battletech developer, but he'll never fill Nystul's shoes and he sure as Hell will never even come close to doing as good of a job as Stackpole did fleshing out the Battletech universe. May Hanse and Ian Davion rest in peace..."
3,"Good, but with a lack of ending; litteraly","I bought Charmed: Garden of Evil to read considering it's one of my favorite tv shows and I had read all of the others. However, I was upset to find that the book, which had been farely good, did not have an ending; literaly. The last page stopped in the middle of a sentence. I was also disapointed to find that all of the books at my local bookstore were like that. I liked the book except for that one detail and having not been able to find a book with and ending I feel I can not give it the proper review and more than 3 stars. If I do find a book with an ending I'd probably be willing to give it a better rating."
4,Garden Of Evil - Charmed or not?,"Out of the many Charmed novels that have been released, 'Garden Of Evil' is definately one of the best. It firstly explains about the three sisters, and how they had lost a sister Prue to evil. The newest Charmed One-Paige is introduced and being new to the craft, she makes the mistake of dating a man, even though her sisters warn her that this man may not be as he seems. She gets trapped in a magic garden and her sisters have to find a way to rescue her before she falls under the spell of her boyfriend. This book is definately Charmed!"
5,Demanding!,This is probably the most demanding boxing workout video ever produced. Mr. Olajide leads his charges very well. Kudos to Kathy Smith for lending herself to this video. Not for wimps!
4,"A different, fun, energetic workout.","This is a very different kind of workout if you're used to mainly running and aerobics. It's great for an aerobic workout, but works mostly your calves (from jumping rope) and arms, back, and shoulders (mine are still sore -- in a good way -- five days later). It's a nice way to spice up your exercise routine, although the aerobic part could be a little longer. What makes it especially nice is that Kathy herself can't always keep up with the boxing pro who ""runs"" the class. Not a lot of talk, and seemingly not a lot of moving around, but you sweat!"
5,Killer!!,"Jerry Lee gives an absolutely electrifying performance!No doubt in my mind that he still ""has it"" and any fan of his will ""want it""! He literally rocks the stage! Don't miss this downright orgasmic experience!"
5,a great portrait of Jerry Jee Lewis,A perfect piece for my rock&roll; DVD collection.Had no problems with the seller. :)
3,Jelly Babies,"Yes, I am a Doctor Who fan. Finally got around to trying these. They are good. Just not to my taste. I think the powdery stuff throws of my taste for them. Gummy exterior with real juice inside. The powder coating added a taste that to me took away from the flavor. Still good enough to eat the 2 bags I kept. People ate the one at my brothers Christmas buffet, and my older brother (another Doctor Who fan) enjoyed the fourth bag."
3,Very small bag for the price.,"I ordered three of these for my boyfriend. Unfortunately, I failed to note the size of the packages when ordering. Adding the cost of shipping, I ended up paying about eight dollars per bag, with each bag containing about one big handful of candy. The quality of the candy was just fine, but wow, were they pricey!"
4,Not bad,"I got 2 packs of these. One for a friend who is a huge fan of Dr. Who and one for me (out of curiosity). I liked them, they are cover in a powdered sugar and very flavorful. My wife however, hated them. I suspect she was expecting more sugary sweet American type gummi type candy. These are more fruity, less sugary."
1,Not good in hot weather,"I ordered these British candy jells not realizing they don't travel well in hot weather. They arrived stuck together in one mass. To taste them I had to cut out a chunk. I live in Las Vegas with hot summers. My advice, don't order if delivery would be in hot weather or to hot locations. Other than that they seemed fine."
5,My favorite hour of comedy,"I can watch this time and time again and never tire of It. This is, so far, timeless and so reminiscient of real life. I actually bought several copies as stocking stutters, to share the laughter."
5,EXTREMELY FUNNY!,"I rented this dvd and I couldn't stop laughing. It was so good, I bought it. Her jokes on real life situations are so funny, it is hard not to laugh. I watched it over 20 times and it still makes me laugh. It's a must-buy for all you comedy fans!"
5,Awesome,"This will have you falling out of your seat laughing. It's a little slow in the beginning, but it is so worth it by the middle and end!"
4,good cd,Glad to find the cd... BUT THE DAMN THING WAS A CLEAN VERSION. Would have preferred the normal... explicit version. Not too happy about that!!!!Most likely wont buy from you again.
3,Minister looking for Stories for Christmas Eve Service,"This is a wonderful book, but it is limited to American Christmas songs and it main focus is non-religious songs. There are only eight stories about Traditional religious carols, and about five spirituals. Still I loved the stories, such as the one about the history of White Christmas, although I could not use it in my Christmas Eve service."
2,FULL of errors!,"Great idea for the book BUT spoiled by incorrect facts and explanations on almost every page! Thus it is good if you use it for the questions but NOT the answers.Someone (wish I had the time) needs to list all the corrections on a website (just a suggestion) for this book to be fully utilised - until the author can correct the mistakes. (if someone gets the website off the ground, I will gladly contribute correct answers)Having said this, I am still glad I got the book for the questions and to be pointed in the right direction. If only the author would correct the answers....GavinATPL"
2,Not as good as some of their other chips,I didn't care for these chips as much as I did the Sun Dried Tomato ones.There are a different chip that I can't explain the taste.
3,Best and worst of Victorian genre histories,"This is a great book if you are interested in the Victorian Age and how it manifested in the US.This is a very boring book if you are looking for a ""good read"" on the Civil War. One would think the book is full of fascinating anecdotes, songs, and poems giving a micro-history voice to a macro event. But the verse is so tortured--to song and poem, and the written word so long-winded in expression to the anecdotes that one can only take this work in small doses--if at all."
5,love it,bought as a gift. they say its the best dvd on korea they have ever seen. i would buy it again.
2,Poor Recording Quality,I was very disappointed in the recording quality of this cd. It sounded like it was recorded in someone's church basement with a portable cassette recorder. I didn't make it through the 1st song.
1,Arafat is smiling,"This video is a tour de force of liberal, left-wing propaganda. It selects the ""facts"" to paint an extremely biased and inaccurate pictue of the Israeli right. The self-hatered evident among a few Israelis of the left ""lunatic fringe"" is remeniscent of the anti-American sentiment in our own country during the Vietnam war. If Arafat was really smart - he would tap into his Swiss bank accounts and a buy a copy for every American and European. For one seeking the ""big picture"" - this was very disappointng."
1,The wrong stuff...,"These WERE good, but apparently they are no longer made. They have been replaced with crap full of soy products - and they were shipped to me without warning, and without asking if the substitute (even a different product name) was acceptable.Don't buy this. Don't buy it from this amazon store."
2,taste like dust,"The delivery is fast. But the product tastes awful. I bought it based on so many good reviews. Now that I wonder if they have drank real cappuccino or do we live in a different universe.Definitely does not taste like Cappuccino. Nor does it taste like any kind of coffee. It taste more like hot chocolate, but with a strange almond flavor. Also, it has a dusty palate. I think it may has been stocked for too long. Not buying it again. And now I'm stuck with 6 tins to finish!"
2,Maybe I just have a mental block --,"I'm a smart girl but I STILL cannot make heads or tails out of bookkeeping. Although I now understand credits and debits, the journal entering and what not just didn't make sense. The book seemed to be too general for me. I really needed more detailed, beginner-friendly information and guidance. Maybe if you have a general idea of how bookkeeping works, this book will work for you. I, on the other hand, bought this book having absolutely no knowledge of bookkeeping, and unfortunately, I still don't."
4,Great book for beginners,I like this book as a beginner-- it's an easy read and it also gives you a lot of tips and tricks.
2,Not for me!,Was way more than I needed in the way of accounting. It gave me too much information for what I needed.
2,don't bother - its junk,No video review because there is no working product. Some assembly required however some of the pieces don't even fit together. Only one pedal fit in the bike. Front wheel fell off after 20 minutes of use. If you buy one make sure you get 2 or three more for parts.The ironic thing is that this bike was recalled because it didn't have a brake. I guess the fact that it may fall apart during use is not so much a safety issue as the brake.
5,Another Helping of Plum Duff!,"Not familiar with Aubrey and Maturin? Patrick O'Brian's nautical series is a MUST READ, especially the narrated audible version narrated by Patrick Tull. The hours just seem to slip by, as you listen to the gritty, amusing and stoic account of the dynamic duo's life on the high seas during the Napoleonic era.This novel (book 8), finds Aubrey and Maturin in the Greek Islands, in a sub-standard 'ship of the line' called the Worcester. The crew must cope with boredom, storms, and an inscrutable Scottish moralist, Graham. In particular I found the parts with the old Admiral and his little pug dog particularly moving. This novel is a MUST read for fans of nautical fiction.Entertainment in its purest form."
2,Not much insight,"After 20 years of teaching the book of Jeremiah, Mr. Carroll has apparently come to the conclusion that neither he, nor anyone else, has any real clue as what it's about, or what any of it really means. He is very pessimistic about our ability to understand Jeremiah. After reading his book, I wondered why he even bothered to write it, other than to tell non-scholars that they're wasting their time. That being said, there are a few useful insights and it can help prevent a reader from being too naive about his grasp of the message."
1,frustateing,"first it was shipped to wrpong address , then it was missing about 50% of itys nuts and bolts. then new holes had to be redrilled since they didn't match up"
2,"If you want violence and gore galore, this is it.","Really bad movie, but lots of blood, so much in fact that the movie is Drop Dead funny. Terrible acting, and ludicrous story, but compulsively watchable and entertaining. Not once was I scared while watching Make Them Die Slowly! I found I laughed throughout the movie. The blood and gore are so rampant in this movie you are amused, not repulsed at it. So be forewarned, Make Them Die Slowly, is bloody, and gory to the max, but Ed Wood watchable."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"I rented this movie years ago. I fell for the ""Banned in 26 countries"" label that was on the box. It warns you about scenes of total barbarianism that will be difficult to watch. The only thing difficult was keeping myself from laughing most of the time.A group of scientists are in the tropical rainforest when they stumble upon a couple of criminals on the run. (They do not know this, of course). Somehow they find themselves captured by a tribe living in the jungle and they are subjected to torture and violent death.These ""scenes"" are for the most part pretty awfully shot. But if you need to know what is in this.......a tribe member eating a huge live larva, a guy getting part of his head chopped off, another becoming a permanent poster boy for birth control, and a woman who is hung by her breasts on a couple of steel hooks.If this sort of thing is entertainment to you, go for it. It will come with the usual bad acting, awful music, and incredibly bad camerawork."
2,A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!,"In response to melvin's review. Anyone that buys this type of movie is expecting 1,000 gallons of gore. That's the point! A horror movie surrounded by hype of 98 on the vomit meter is expected to produce buckets of blood and guts. Not every movie has to swim in gore but when they boast about it it should contain a lot more than Cannibal Ferox produced. Real animals are slaughtered everyday for food, just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.As for the movie, it's boring, pointless and down right ridiculous. Horror fans will be extremely disappointed with this piece of trash. Not only is there much better horror movies out there. There are much better Cannibal movies out there like Cannibal Holocaust or Jungle Holocaust. Steer Clear of this overhyped and under delivered movie."
2,Notorious Euro-Trash,"Umberto Lenzi's most notorious entry into the ""Italian Cannibal"" subgenre is a contender with Cannibal Holocaust with the most bloodshed. Whereas Cannibal Holocaust was a well made exploitation film, Ferox is just a standard Euro-trash film laden with shocking gore moments. A student travels into the deep Amazon with a group of friends to prove here thesis that cannibalism never existed. They of course find evidence to prove this wrong. Our characters meet up with two criminals (tied in with a poorly explained subplot that takes place in New York City) who, guilty by association, get the entire group into sickening torture situations by a vengeful cannibal tribe. As usual, in poor taste, there are some real animal killings. Most of the music was taken from Umerto Lenzi's previous cannibal film Eaten Alive!"
1,the Plan 9 of cannibal films,"If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few. One of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made. If Cannibal Holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films, then ferox is the plan 9."
3,i think i napped a bit,"ok. goriest movie ever? heck no, saving ryan's privates was bloodier than this movie. can everybody cry killing helpless animals?? i dunno, for the most part that stuff seemed like a typical national geographic episode to me. one and only one good gore scene involves hooks and breasts. some might say the castration scene was also good, but it didn't move me. ninety percent of the film is just boring attempt at a really lame plot. it might have helped a bit if the film led us to identify with the cannibals more....."
3,Pink Panther Strikes Again Review,"This Pink Panther movie is not as good as A Shot In The Dark or the original Pink Panther. However, it is quite entertaining. Peter Sellers is funny as usual."
3,"GOOD, NOT ESSENTIAL","I really wanted to like this in a 5-star way! Anytime I see reviews with comparisons to ""Pet Sounds,"" I take notice. The songs are good lyrically and musically. There's a certain ""fakeness"" to them for me, though. The liner notes mention Pro Tools, and that's what I hear most, I think. Vocals, as well as horns, strings, etc. all sound like they're artificial. Compare this sound to the sound made by studio musicians of Brian Wilson's 60's. There is no comparison. I do like the ""multi-tracked"" sound that is going on in many of the songs. Certainly well-crafted, but fake."
5,Excellent............,"Very good, very sharp, very value priced knives. Love them. I am having a hard time keeping my family from using them for everything."
5,Everything I expected,"These knifes replaced non-serrated steak knifes that even though sharpened always seemed to have some trouble when cutting steak. These have no problem what so ever. Carefull, they are extremely sharp new and even a small brush against a finger when opening the package caused a cut."
5,Victorinox 48792 Knife set,"Absolutely hands down the best kitchen knives I have used. They cut well, look nice and have comfortable to hold handles. The best part about these knives is that they are DISHWASHER SAFE!!!!!!! Buy them!"
5,anolon butter warmer,"Like all Anolon kitchen products, this butter warmer is a terrific item. Very high quality and functional. Highly recommended!"
5,AMAZING,"This book is AMAZING. If you are remotely interested in Alaska, do not walk, but run to buy this book. It is out of print, but you can still find it here on Amazon.This book is about a couple trying to make a go of it in Alaska. From NYC and having no clue. It is a terrific book and I find it fairly accurate about life in Alaska."
2,A GIFT FOR A YOUNG PARENT,Unfortunately this book did not live up to expectations; dated and refersto software that no longer exists. Needs a rewrite for sure. Would not buy again.
2,Not The Best,"I got this album and thought it was going to awsome. I was very disappointed by it. It doesn't compare at all to Blueprints for the Black Market or Never Take Friendship Personal. If you're going to get any of Anberlin's albums, buy the earlier stuff. It will hold your attention better."
5,Best Album ever by Anberlin,"Anberlin does it again with Cities their third album which is awesome. I only have Cities and Never Take Friendships Personal and avoided Blueprints. The best tracks on the cd would be Godspeed, The Unwinding Cable Car, Hello Alone, Alexithymia,Dismantle. Repair and Fin. Its my favorite album and you will never bored or tired of the songs because this is their best album in my opinion next to NTFP and New Surrender. The lyrics are beautiful and Christian really shows why he is the best vocalist in my opinion right now in the christian music industry. If your a new fan of the band then check out Cities and Never Take Friendships Personal and New Surrender."
5,Dallas Cowboys 10 Greatest Games,Must have for a True Cowboys fan. I would like to suggest if there is a volume 2. They should include A couple of Redskin games. Other than that i was very happy.
5,The Best Band Ever,"McFly Is the one Of the Best Bands that has come around in the history of music. My Name is Kayla and Im 16 years old, and I live in the United States, And Iam one of the biggest MCfly Fans Out there and I absolutly adore the boys in the band and thier music. I Like Busted to but not as much as McFly. They Have the best Lyrics and the best voices that I have heard in a Long time. If You like the Band Busted, then you will love Mcfly. When You listen to 1 song all you want is to hear more and more of thier songs. Most People think That when there's more than one guy in a Band it means It's a boy band, But McFly is not a boy band, there a new and better generation of Music. Thier Music and Voices speak for them selves. I highly Recomend this Cd To any age Group. MCFLY ROCKS AND IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD!!!"
2,OK for a cheap knife,"I can't complain about the Furi Santoku I own too much since it came free with the sharpener. It stayed pretty sharp for a year or so with regular sharpening and maintenance. However, as I've continued to use it more, I have noticed it no longer holds and edge and will not sharpen like it used to. Definitely worth saving your pennies to buy a decent knife. I plan on buying a set of Globals later this year."
1,Shame on Amazon and Rachel Ray,"Wish there a category for NO stars.I returned this item. IMMEDIATELY. Cheesy knives, with orange rubber handle (a good idea, just badly executed)half-heartedly attached to blade, with frayed ends that fairly screamed MADE(POORLY)IN CHINA. The smaller of mine had a suspicious black blemish on the handle, hinting of prior ownership. Worst of all -- the blades were hopelessly DULL. Did not realize Rachel Ray was that desperate -- with her franchise right now, she should be more caredful of her endorsements. AS SHOULD AMAZON.And while we're at it, please process refund quickly -- it was a gift certificate, and I want to use it for something decent."
3,I expected better...,"I was so happy to receive this set on Christmas morning! I then, however, sliced open my thumb while trying to remove those DUMB stickers from the blades. Why not use pressure-sensitive ones? The razor-sharp blades also sliced through the clear blade covers. As noted by another reviewer, the blades look cheap, dull, cheap, feel very light, and cheap! The grip feels great in my hand and is non-slip. Very disappointed with the thin, dull, light, dirty looking blades with the dorky stampings and stupidly, hard to remove stickers on the blades. For $100, the quality should be excellent. They somehow look and feel (blade) like a ""made in China"" (which they are) special from Wal-Mart. But, they were a gift. I will use them, once my thumb heals, and and see how they perform."
3,THE MANY PERILS OF FLIGHT,"Chapters in this book are organized by the cause of disaster. There is a chapter on mid air collision, one on fire and one on pilot error, just to name a few. The author focuses on a few accidents, and on how and why they happened. The Challenger shuttle disaster and the Iran airbus shootdown are each given a chapter to themselves.Some of the stories are actually funny; one military plane crashed because the pilots left the controls to 'moon' the occupants of another aircraft. But for the most part this is a rather dull read, with little to grab the reader's attention. This book is part of a series, so not having read the others I feel I may have missed something, but I think it unlikely the others are much better."
3,"The player is good, but . . .","I now need a new battery for this player and I've found it near impossible to find a battery and when I did find one, it cost $80.00 plus shipping. That's a disappointment."
1,Very poor product!,"I bought this player in March, it wouldn't load dvds within a month. It was repaired under warrenty but it now won't load dvds again 6 months later. Now I have to spend $100 to fix it. That's pretty shameful quality! I will probably just buy another brand instead. If you want to buy one - also buy the service plan!"
1,24 hrs in the car with kids-one DvD then nothing,Crossed my fingers and hoped for the best but the DVD player played one DVD the refused to load another.
5,Superb,This Portable DVD is the best on the market for the price. The screen is big enough to see any of your favorite films and the sound is great too. A great investment.
5,Wonderful Product,"We bought this portable DVD player for a road trip with our two sons ages 11 and 9. While we don't generally encourage watching a lot of movies, this was the best purchase we had made in a long time. It was a long trip, with many traffic and weather delays, so this product certainly helped keep our boys busy. It has two headphones so noone was complaining that they couldn't hear. It kept it's charge the entire trip-over eight hours- and comes with an easy adapter for recharging in the car or in a hotel. My husband and I also used it when the boys were asleep. The headphones let us watch without disturbing their sleep. I would certainly recommend this to anyone."
3,"Great shoe, but on the small side",The shoe was everything I was looking for but a little stiff and on the small side. had it come in wide and a size bigger i think it would have been the perfect gift!
3,Looking for A Wedding by Itself?,"Like one of the other reviewers, I also have M*A*S*H and wanted just A Wedding by itself. Every once in a blue moon, either the Fox Movie Channel or Turner Movie Classics will play A Wedding. If your cable or satellite provider includes these channels, keep your eyes peeled for A Wedding. Then record it with a VCR or DVD recorder. That's what I did. Or we will get lucky and A Wedding will be released separately."
2,Hate It,"It functions well enough but I just can't get used to the feel/fit of it. (It coils around your inner ear) It's just sitting at home now, unused"
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!,I have the Sanyo Katana phone. This bluetooth constantly looses the connection to the phone. A platronics blue tooth works fine...You get what you pay for...It's uncomfortable to wear inside the ear too !
4,Age appropriate and fun,"I bought this computer game for my 3-yr. old niece. She caught on very quickly since she is familiar with the computer and the mouse. I also purchased this for my friend's son, who hasn't used the computer as much. He struggled a little with the mouse since you have to point the mouse on specific features and then click after it is highlighted. If your child isn't familiar with using a mouse, you will have to help them until they get the hang of it. But since kids catch on rather quickly, it shouldn't take long. I recommend this game for beginners and kids who like animals. I have only explored the first level, so I expect levels 2 & 3 will be just as fun, but at a higher learning level."
1,Cost twice as much than Wal Mart with shipping! This part is not worth ordering online.,"I have Arthritus #4, 4 being worst, and degenterative Osteoporosis, in my knee, pain every day. NO over the counter pain reliever worked. I tried Tiger Balm wrapped it with an ace bandage to hold in the heat, and never needed any pill again for pain! Believe me it works!"
3,Small but nice still,"I took this on an extended trip this summer. It is not big enough for a laptop charger. Although packed, it held my ipod cables, cell phone charger, pda cables, and exilim digital camera cables (with small dock). I am glad that I had it; it kept all of my things in one place, without tangling."
3,Great Classics but watch out for the Spyware,"This is a great collection of the old classic atari games.Unfortunately, the install includes the power reg scheduler and also attempts to add a browser search engine. In my opinion, the games are not worth the problems of having spyware installed on my machine."
1,Atari PC Game,The game it self is fun to play; but when I want to switch games my computer freezes up. Does anyone know why so that I can fix it or did I buy a junk game?
5,Coming from someone who knows this book inside and out...,"This textbook is fantastic, very well thought out, great use of examples and background information. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Johns Hopkins University and an Engineer at NASA and have worked with this textbook for creating a new edition with Dr. Ram Gupta (the author of the text) and can say for certain that this text is a great resource for hydrology inside and outside of class."
5,Pretty but small...,"This is a beautiful little coffee mug, it is only about six ounces, which for me is an espresso. It makes a great gift, it is well made, very pretty."
5,Lovely craftsmanship in a standard size mug,"This is a well made piece of German china, with a gold plated rim. Holds a standard 6oz cup of coffee, as made, for example, by our Keurig coffee maker. Another reviewer implied it is a demitasse, which it is not. I suppose in the age of Super Big Gulps, a normal cup seems small. I for one do not care for the oversize mugs so commonly marketed with logos. This is a great, quality item, sure to please any Porschephile."
1,¡Ay! No se puede comprarla sin subtítulos.,"When watching this TV movie, there are blackouts and long pauses between scenes, and the film's heavy hands are so laden with corn that one feels cheated out of the commercials. DA and GCS are dragged through syndicated citcom leftovers in a plot that every viewer knows before watching. Minimal elderly hijinx ensue, and the life's lesson is regurgitated shamelessly. Scott's cliched veediot ""mother"", a slapstickily inept hitman, and an inexplicable/unexplained mute punk girl provide the gratuitous sideplots. In short, anyone who would like to own this movie should already have taped it of the tele. Lo siento."
2,I returned this item after inspection,"I had recently used a very old pair of auto focus (fixed focus) Bushnells and this item was as close as I could get to that pair. It just not do as good a job and since I have other binoculars, I returned them."
4,Great novel,I love that novel. Had read it in German years ago and want to share it with pure English speakers. Too funny! Delivery was reasonably quick and the book was in decent shape. A shame that it is out of print!
5,Bought for grandaughter,"Bought for granddaugter. She asked for it should we see it. Found it here and when we gave it to her, she was extatic."
2,A disappointment,"There are lots of books out there with mature writers if that's all one wants. I like to identify with the 'good guy' and tune out of every day life, so, he just needs to get back to Devlin and the kick 'butt' action."
3,very soft,"These strap covers were very soft and cute. My 11 month old daughter however, can't stand having them on the carseat straps. She wants to play with them so she gets very mad when she can't pull them off the straps. Maybe when she's older I'll be able to use them? Right now she just likes them for a toy."
4,So soft!,"I got these to try and improve my baby's car seat experience, they're soft but bulky for an infant."
1,Not Safe !,"These do not allow you to have your baby properly secured into the infant seat, they make the chest buckle sit way too low on babys chest. Other buyers warned but I pruchased anyways =( Not Safe will not use."
5,Data watch review,The watch is exactly what I was hoping for. It fits well andfeels like it will last me for a long time.
5,Very nice watch.,"This was a gift and the recipient is very happy withthe watch. It has space for addresses and phone numbers,stop watch, etc."
5,Great Watch,"This watch is everything i expected it to be. I don't normally use the databank since i have a smartphone, but i put in a couple of important numbers for the heck of it. Works perfectly. The 10 year battery is always a plus :)"
5,Best Watch Ever,"This watch is a long time best purchase. Worn for everyday and also out in the field- durable and very comfortable. Matter a fact this time I ordered two just to have a spare! Used for an alarm clock and easy to read numbers. Now a days, the data bank feature isn't used as much as it was in the day but always a good feature to have at your finger tips! wow- enjoy."
2,Unsturdy Table!,This toy is great fun for kids who don't care about making what the pictures show. The side table doesn't stay on and is so annoying that we just threw that part out and kept the tabletop which has various food molds on the bottom. It would be nice if this toy came with a storage container for all the parts. Don't expect the press to work very well. It sucks. The stove is too cute though. I wouldn't pay more than $[...] for this toy [...].
1,Disappointing,My daughter received this as a Christmas gift this year and it was very difficult to use. The clay does not stay on the center of the wheel and there is no way she would have been able to use this without my help. Very disappointing.
2,"Useless as a Pottery ""Wheel""","If you manage to get the clay into place on the wheel, which is not easy, once the wheel starts turing,the carving blade simply pushes the clay off center and messes it up. There should be something in the bottom of the wheel to hold the clay in place. In a real wheel, I assume the weight of the clay holds it in place. But this small peice of clay does not have nearly the weight needed to hold it in place as the wheel turns so the clay just goes all over the table rather than being shaved into a circle. The only useful part of this toy is the clay itself, which your child can mold with their hands into whatever shape they want. Then they can decorate it and paint it after it is dry. I suppose that is worth some money, but the ""wheel"" part of it is useless."
1,THIS STINKS!!!,"I am twelve years old and I got this for Christmas. I was so excited because I love being creative. When we tried to put it together, it was hard, but we stuck with it. Finally we put it together and it DIDN'T WORK! I repeat DO NOT BUY! The tools don't work, everything breaks, and there isn't anything that does what it is supposed to! Like, seriously, I hate everything except the clay. The clay was nice. I ended up just making a cute little mushroom with my hands and it looks awesome. I tried to do the same thing with the wheel and it ended up as a misshapen lump. So, we sent back the box, directions, wheel, everything except the clay, now in the form of a mushroom pot and I am writing this review as a warning: DO NOT BUY. And I can't believe Santa would bring something so ridiculously awful, so now I do not believe in Santa anymore. THANKS ALOT!"
1,just buy clay instead !,"totally totally did not work. Very disappointing. Don't buy it! The directions were hard to follow, and ultimately, we just ended up playing with the clay. Very sad 8 year old and her mom!"
3,Hrhaharhtzaha Frianktzanarali Kolhidshissi,"Altough this book is interesting, Gurdjieff uses some writing-style cryptography to render it very difficult (and sometimes unpleasant) to read.This goes from the first chapter's page-long sentences containing 12 to 15 comas to the rest of the book's unpronounceable page-wide words. What some others writers give out clearly in a few lines of clear text, he encrypt in 50 pages :(anyway, if you purchase this book, be ready to have a hard time reading it..."
1,Don't buy this CD,The CD is a total waste of time. It has a series of unrelated files that are almost impossible to organize for reading. There is no centralized organization or search function. Don't bother buying it.
4,Worth watching!,"Why do you think it's cheap food? Because it's CHEAP. And, as this amazing crusade shows, it's addictive and super-bad for our health. The old adage, 'you get what you pay for' is true."
3,It's OK for an elementary science class,"I bought this product before there were any reviews on it. The product description wasn't very thorough, but I purchased it anyway. I had thought that it would at least be somewhat accurate in its depiction of the Solar System, but I was wrong. Nothing is in the correct scale as far as size goes (Jupiter is nearly as large as the sun). The graphics on the planets are not even close to being accurate. The planets on this item all rotate in unison; not realistic. I could go on...I was very bored with this item within a day or two. I suppose it was mostly my fault for expecting too much from the product from the beginning. I do see how this product could be of value for a early elementary school science class where the students are just beginning to learn the order of the planets in our Solar System. Other than that, I don't see any real value in this product."
2,"Nice idea, poorly executed","The idea was great, but the build quality is not good. The top that goes over the sun does not snap into place and consequently will not stay on. The star constellation cover has the same issue. It is a nice idea but since the lid will not stay on, you either have to sort of balance it on top and not jostle it, or use some sticky tape to secure the lid. Other than that it works as expected, but my daughter is really sad that she cannot use it as she expected because the lid will not stay put."
5,Awesome & Educational,"Great toy! My six yr old daughter love this. Not only it is entertaining, it is also educational. I can incorporate a lot of scientific concepts using this toy."
2,"great idea, but doesn't work","This looked like a really neat way for our kids to learn more about the solar system. It even comes with a chart to (roughly) align the planets in relation to each other according to time of year. The planetarium feature is a bit dim - I can see the constellations, but can't read the names. Our motor feature doesn't work - the planets do not revolve. We haven't gotten around to sending it back yet. If we get one that works, I would give it a higher rating."
2,Only portraits,"Almost all of these pictures are portraits of players. Usually, just their faces. I would have liked more varied pictures of the early game, rather than a bunch of closeups of faces of players. Ended up being fairly boring."
2,OK I guess......,"It takes a little while to heat up. It shouldn't be used on dry or damaged hair. I bought this so that I could get the shorter pieces in the back of my hair straight that my larger straightner wouldn't do. With this one, it takes a lot longer and leaves some obvious straihtner marks on my do... thinking back I should have spent a little more on a higher quality item."
3,Description is wrong,"Be aware that while I think these are great they don't put the weight in the description. the Small/Med is up to 33 lbs. and my daughter is 34 lbs so this is useless for me. It would have been nice to know that. The Med/Lg is for above 33 lbs. I hope this helps someone decide since Amazon couldn't get it right.Also, I got yellow, not the pink as pictured!"
5,Fantastic!,"Very Enthralling indeed. A mix of history that only vindicates my sensual desires. It was quite permissive and residually pleasing. Quite satisfying for such a archaic document. It's so very hard to find information on the subject matter these days. People tend to forget our past especially our Anglo-European history. For being so informative and rare I give this item 5 stars. It would do us all good to not be ignorant of such things. The jester is not just a character, but a symbol of madness and desire. I simply love reading about what the world has become today. A plethora of madness and desire. Weakness is what plagues the withering rose we call the United States today. Like a plague it jumps from petal to petal destroying our very way of life. Such is life, such is beauty, and such is the world. Please join me, join the logical and strong side.....the side of vigor and power. Then we can watch the world destroy itself with ""causality abound""."
5,Orestes Please,"I think everyone who has read this collection for the most part agrees that No Exit is one of the greatest plays written. What seems to receive little attention in the reviews on Amazon is the play the Flies. Sartre's reworking of the greek tragedy lives up to the original. I would suggest to future readers that they read the Orestia et al. and then approach the reworking. Sartre adds to one of the oldest story in the western cannon, and that addition is valuable."
5,Personal Transformation,"To say that Michael Bernard Beckwith is a profound spiritual teacher is an understatement, and to see the way he integrates his spiritual practice into his own life was truly amazing. I will be watching this film again and again and buying it for all my friends."
1,"Disappointing, doesn't deliver","This product did not make my husband's woodworking project easier or better, it took longer to clean up because it just didn't work and he was extremely frustrated."
3,"OK, But Hard To Read","This book has lots to choose from! There are scenes from Euripedes and Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams and Henrik Ibsen... It contains scenes for two men, two women, one man & one women. This book would be better if it was characterized by what kind of scene (ie: comedy, etc..) as well. It is very time consuming to read through looking for the type of scene you want. I recommend Norman A. Bert's ""The Scenebook for Actors."" Good luck, Thespians!"
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER,"Among the top five fantasy novels ever, in my opinion. The most gripping book of an outstanding series -- evokes comparisons to Tolkien's works (and that is high praise)."
3,Thomas Covenant,I loved the chance of re-reading the first chronicles again after first experiencing the frustrating white golder wielder over 20 years ago.I read the first three books quickly enjoying meeting old friends again. Will be great when 2nd chronicles come out on e-books.
4,cracked case,"The CD is just what we wanted, unfortunately the case had a small crack in it, and it was a gift, so I was a little disappointed to give a less than perfect gift, but it also wasn't worth a return and exchange. So basically, things are fine. I would recommend better packaging though."
2,This was the weak spot of the movie,"It's a shame that with a very good movie that the soundtrack is not good. Sheryl Crow's song starts out very good, but then she wrecks it with a harmonica. The rest were not good either. The only ones that are salvagable here are the Chords ""Shboom"" which is classic, and Rascal Flatts had enough horse sense not to put harmonica on their cover of Tom Cochran's: ""Life Is A Highway"", and made it a nice groovy country song out of it; however, the rest are just terrible. I could've picked out better car tunes in my sleep. For starters how about Link Wray's ""Jack The Ripper"", or War Babies ""Sweetwater"", and also the Rip Chords with ""Hey Little Cobra"", and the other granddaddy of car tunes The Beach Boys ""Shut Down"". This is still a good movie, and no one should miss it, but the soundtrack is the main flaw."
5,Excellent,This is a great CD. All the music is fun and great to put in the CD player in the Car especially. Some good drivin tunes.
4,Fun and Bouncy,"This was a gift for an adult man who had seen ""Cars."" Since I did not see the movie, I wanted to hear what was on the CD that an adult would like. Top performers play the best old and new songs from the animated movie, and you cannot help bouncing along with the music. It is not cartoon or children's music. I dare you to sit still! I don't remember whether I heard the music on the Amazon site or went to the internet to hear it, but it is great!"
4,Kids love it,"It was a gift for my grand children. They were thrilled with the movie and love the CD. Looking forward for the DVD,"
5,it is the best video animation ever.by ishmael boddie queens,iwant more episoides of the guyver.please make some more or sell them again in queens of new york city.i also like the concept of the guyver.you would be a big success if you came on television inthe united states(new york city in particular).but you might have to calm down with the blood.
1,true stinker,"As a lover of all things BRUCE CAMPBELL,I can't tell you how much this thing sucked.the writing was pitiful,acting worse.It was so bad I could not tell you one good thing about it.buy THE MAN WITH THE SCREAMING BRAIN if you need a BRUCE CAMPBELL fix."
4,Big Smiles,My 19 month old just received this as a gift after a recent surgery and wow did she light up when Pooh started walking. She loves this. He's soft and talks to you. I think everything about him is great. He asks for hugs and says thank you after giving them. His only negative is that he has hard time walking on the carpet & his volume is only 1 level which can be a little loud. He is similar to the Hokey Pokey Elmo but more advanced (walking & talking). Pooh really delivers in SMILES.
3,One twin loves it....the other is scared of it!,I thought this was the cutest toy....its various phrases and actions really make it come alive. Aparently too alive for one of my twin girls! She screams when it comes walking towards her. She is only 12 month...maybe a little too soon for her. Otherwise a fun little guy for the playroom.
2,Walking away,"If you've never heard BUOS before and love the new ""pop"" sound coming out of every other artist on the radio, this is the album to buy-- plenty of catchy tunes and funky rythems. Very little of this album actually carries the deeper musicality that can be heard on their earlier albums, a good starter album for new listeners, but older fans will find little to like and much to be disapointed in."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad, Some Just Plain Ol' Boring","With the exceptions of the hit single ""Hey Leonardo,"" ""Stone Glass Window,"" and a couple others, this album fails to offer much that's interesting to listen to. It's full of mostly conventional pop hooks which, like anything sugary, will satisfy only for the first couple of tastes."
4,More than a Single,"I got this CD on impulse, cuz I thought that Hey Leonardo was a fun song. Little did I know that the album had so much more to offer. A couple of the songs were hokey, but Walking Off is a great record overall. Standing at the Edge of the Earth is one of the most awesome, heartfelt songs I've ever heard, and The Rest of My Life is a great love song that reflects the feelings of a lot of guys out there. I think this is a great CD for anyone who likes good, varied music, but if you tire of regretful love songs, this IS NOT the album for you."
2,One Hit Wonder,"This CD totally disappointed me. Track 3 (she likes me for me) is basically the only decent song on this entire CD. Every other song sounded like exact replicas of each other. They attempted a few upbeat songs, but the all ended with a big flop. Two thumbs down for this one."
1,...What?,"I don't know what the rest of you were reading, but this book sucked, majorly. This is the worst Thornton book I've ever read. I couldn't believe all the great reviews for this piece of crap!First of all, there actually was a misunderstanding, a big one that went throughout the book about Sara being a ""whore."" What pissed me off to no extent was the fact that she not only didn't deny this, but she encouraged this accusation. She was possibly one of the stupidest heroines I've ever read about. She never even gave a reason for this when Max asked her why she didn't tell him the truth about her virginity.The entire book was just constant mood swings from both characters, along with an incredibly boring mystery which I figured out within the first few chapters."
1,1 star is too much - way too much,"The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these.To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton.These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this - and neither do you."
1,crumbs from the laurel and hardy table,"As a life-long fan of Stan and Ollie, I continue to be depressed at the relative absence of the availability of their classic works on DVD. Except for the thrown-together Hallmark volumes which , for the most part, use poor dupes of 35mm material and for Turner's L&H; ""collection"" with FRA DIAVOLO and BONNIE SCOTLAND, two of their weakest Roach films, their is nothing readily available to show the genius of these two timeless performers. The continued release of the weak - and frequently execrable - films for Fox and MGM in the 40s will only cause the unititiated to think L&H; are nothing beyond two aging, unfunny knockabouts.Although the Fox/MGM films might have a place on the shelf of a completist, they are really just depressing. Why does not UNIVERSAL, who releases the ENTIRE body of their Roach work from 1927 -1940 release this massive and impressive set state-side?"
1,Different Films,"This DVD was supposed to have""The Home Wrecker"",""The Four Wheeled Terror"", Roughest Africa"", ""Crazy to Act,"" and ""the Paper Hangers Helper""on it. Those were listed in your catalog and on the box. When played only ""Roughest Africa""of the listed movies is there, along with ""Hustling for Health,"" ""Paper Hangers"", Lucky Dog"",and ""The Soilers"" which weren't in your listing and are not on the box. The other two Laurel and Hardy DVDs purchased at the same time would be rated as 5 star and are completely as listed."
5,Great for grilling!!,"I've always been impressed with the Anolon line and have been slowly adding to my set. This one has to be the best investment I've made. I've cooked burgers, picnic ribs w/BBQ sauce and shish kabobs and everything has had that ""outside grilled"" taste. Best of all is the clean-up - no sweat. Everything just wipes off."
5,Excellent place to start painting with watercolors...,"I just recieved this book today. I read most of it as soon as I got it. And then I started painting right away. The directions are simple and easy to understand. And each lesson will give you satisfaction as you complete it. This book concentrates more on abstracts, shapes, and colors. If this is the style you are looking for this is a great place to start."
1,Not Authentic,"The perfume I purchased on Amazon does not smell like the original one I have had in the past (that I bought in a department store. The bottle and color are the same, but the scent is not. I will not purchase this perfume again, unless I can smell it first."
1,BEWARE,"IDENTICAL to the CD entitled ""Choral Favourites from King's"" (subtitled: Classics for Pleasure - the title of this release!) from EMI Classics ASIN: B000JJ4G7A -- DO NOT ORDER, unless you want a duplicate!"
2,Maybe it's regional?,"I bought this dvd for my husband to learn the night club two step. The way they teach it is way different than it is done in my area. Perhaps it is a regional thing, however My husband and I are very disappointed!"
4,One of my fave Charmed books!!!!,"This book circles around the 3 new strangers who are close to each of the sisters, and each time they meet, something strange happens. Piper's emotions are unruly, Paige seems to be exhausted for nothing and Phoebe has short-term memory loss, and all 3 of their powers are getting weaker and weaker. Just like that. And the more times the sisters meet these ""strangers"", their sudden-weaknesses seem to be worsening (both magical and non-magical). At last, they discover that there is something sinister going on, and they have to pit against these strangers to defeat them AND get their powers back, as all the Ks (strangers) want in revenge, to what happened to their ancestors nearly 3000 years ago. Dark Vengeance indeed.Find out what happens to this awesome story penned by Diana G. Gallagher. Definitely worth your money and your time to read it. Happy reading!!"
3,An overview of the major production models with color photos,"One chapter is devoted to Ferdinand Porsche. Then a chapter is dedicated to each of the five major model families (356, 911/930/959/993, 914, 924/944/968, 928) . One chapter is dedicated to racing Porsches and then a final short chapter covers the ""future"" as envisioned in 1995. (Interesting quote: ""Although the Boxster will never see production, many of its innovative ideas will come to fruition in the 986."" Little did the authors know how Porsche marketing would revive the ""Boxster"" name! Lots of color phots make this an enjoyable book, but the need to cover so many cars makes it hard to provide much detail about any one line. If you're specifically interested in a particular car you might prefer a more focused book. For 911 enthusiasts, I'd recommend Peter Morgan's ""Origiinal Porsche 911""."
2,What a disappointment!,"The tunes are very weak; if these are Bellson's compositions, he has done much better than this. The band does not swing, mostly due to the uninspried arrangements.This is Bellson in his prime, but playing far from his best.There are some good solos by Geller,the Breckers, and Soloff.Of all the great Bellson concerts that could have been filmed(especially with his West Coast Big Bands) why pick this one?"
1,Wasted $.99,Save your money and the pain of having to watch this . You would get more fun out of watching mold grow !
3,"Sound good, wiring bad","I have no complaints about the sound for the price but the wiring aggravates me. It's rubberized and, when you're moving around, it loves to grab onto clothing enough to pull one or 2 out of your ears. As long as you're not moving it's fine, but if you're doing anything physical you'll have problems.And if these get tangled at all have fun. The stickiness of those rubber wires make an already aggravating task of untangling even worse.I also don't understand the point of having the extra link in the middle. Completely useless and unnecessary."
1,Not practical for working out,"For me, the sound quality of these earbuds was fine...actually quite good. But like other reviewers, I found myself very frustrated with the wiring scheme. How frustrated? Well, I sort of snapped at the gym this morning and threw these babies right into the trash (I rescued them a minute or two later). But these are not keepers. In short, if you clip your MP3 player to your waist, the weight of the two cords connected goes all over the place. You'll be continually losing an ear, so to speak...or you'll feel an annoying tugging. Today it took me an agonizingly long time to get through my arms and shoulders weight routine, and I owe it all to these earbuds. Boo. Lesson for me to take-away: no assymetrical...I'm old school, baby...."
2,"good sound, bad for exercise use","The Philips SHE9500 plays loud booming sound when I'm sitting at my desk, but I bought them to jog with, and they fail at that purpose. The asymmetric-cable-behind-the-neck thing is a disaster for me when jogging. Any attempt to turn my head to the left causes the ear bud to pop out, since the cable sticks too easily to the back of my neck or shirt. Plus in my opinion, the extender cable is a pain--it's too short without it, but when connected, it causes a weight on the cable itself, which means any swing of the connector during movement will put tension of the earbuds. And surpise, they pop out. Still, the sound is very good, and songs recorded as lesser volume are easy to hear."
2,"Look and sound good, but buds are too shallow.","The positives: These earbuds sound great for the price. The build quality, sound, split cable, storage pouch, are much nicer than the Sony 71s costing twice as much. (I've tried both)The negatives: The design doesn't allow for them to extend as far into the ear as the Sonys. Despite the adjustable ear buds, they need to go much further into the ear canal and they are just too shallow. A slight tug will jerk them out. This makes them unusable for me. They are going back to Amazon."
2,NOT For Exercising,"I cannot say enough bad things about these if you are going to use them for running. They are made to go on your arm, so one cord is longer than the other. They have a connector half way down that comes with an extender enabling them to be longer and attach to to your waist, but this makes the cord heavy thus pulling them out of your ear. Because the cords are rubber they also bounce a lot when running. I gave them two stars since they do come with multiple size pieces that fit nicely into your ear. If you are going to sit still when using them they are great. If you are planning on using them actively keep looking."
2,Disappointing,I use these earplugs with my 5G iPod. They claim to increase bass but they really do not. They are comfortable in the ear. I don't hear any real improvement over the earplugs that came with the iPod.
1,Purchase if you're deaf in one ear,"These earphones sound great and are the most comfortable that I've come across. Main draw back-- the left channel quit working after 2 weeks of use( With ipod at no more 40% volume). Wow, great job phillips. What a bunch of noobs."
2,No good for running,"These headphones are great if you're going to sit on the train and listen to music on your way to work/school. However, if you plan on doing anything physical while wearing these i would not buy them. The cord lengths weren't measured correctly so regardless of how you try to wear them 1 ear will always be pulled on. They also have an unnecessary joint in the middle that just adds weight to the cord and causes the headphones to pop out while running. Sound quality is fine but i wanted these for the gym and that just didn't work out."
2,Current stemware does not match previously purchased sets.,"I ordered a set of 4 wine glasses to add to my other 12 Spode wine glasses. I was disappointed in that the colors are not nearly as vivid as on the glasses I already own. I also bought a set of 4 from Macy's this holiday season, with the same problem. These purchases are the first in a couple of years, so I'm not sure if Spode has changed something in their color production or this is just a bad year for their stemware. Does anyone else have this issue? The set I purchased from Amazon also had small bubble defects in them. Unfortunately all were returned and I'll have to wait until next year, I guess."
5,Happy I bought this before the $ tanked...,"I purchased this cleaver about 2 years ago, specifically to hack bones for stock (thank you, Edna Lewis! Best recipe EVER!). Perfect balance, weight, sharpness - this cleaver is truly exceptional - such a pleasure to use. The current price is kind of a ""yikes!"" moment, but you get what you pay for. I have no doubt that this cleaver will outlast me, and that's worth 145 bucks. Seriously, I make stock once a month. So in the first year, this cleaver adds $11 for each batch of stock (which still comes out less expensive than that supermarket crap). Over 10 years, it drops to a buck a month. And this cleaver will last much, much longer than 10 years. This is an investment, which is why it will never be available at throwaway Wal-Mart. I promise you will not be disappointed."
5,Global cleaver,"Mine arrived very sharp. Perfect for shaving meat. I use a Chicago heavy duty cleaver for brute jobs, I bang on it with dead blow hammer when needed. The Global is reserved for more refined tasks, like taking a chicken apart or making jerky. I touch up the edge with a Global diamond steel. Actually handier that a Chefs knife for many jobs."
2,Cheap but it worked,"Cheap quality. Item was not shipped from Amazon, item was loosely placed in a usps shipping envelope along with the driver cd, also loose without packaging. The cd was badly scratched because everything was able to shift around inside the packaging."
1,not worth it,"like all singles a little undernourished and boring. although the song, funking and electronic can be a little catchy the remixes aren't much variation. The radio edit, one we all, know is a personal favourite but as a single compolation the album was bitterly dissapointing"
3,Good.,"I went to the Warped Tour this year and this is a perfectly good CD, if you want to hear what you missed, if you didn't go. But, for me, I'd rather see all of those bands live at Warped. Might be more money but worth it. Good deal, you're getting plenty of songs to listen too. Which is nice. But, my main point is buy this__ if you want to hear what you missed at Warped this year or if you wanna remember what you did hear. Not horrible but not amazing great."
1,Digimon rocks warped tour 05,"This is the worst one yet. Were are The locust, Slayer, Dillenger Escape Plan, Sonic youth, Queens of the stone age....Is this what they call a punk festival........ More like whiney emo fest 2005Digimon is 10,00000 times better then this cd....."
2,the movie freezes,"be careful buying this movie, two things 1. the color sucks 2. mine froze half way through the movieand would not play forward"
3,Bonzai,"I was very disappointed in this item. It seems, for whatever reason, the producers glossed over the reality of the actions committed by the Japanese armies wherever they fought. It could have been better."
4,Japan's War in Color.,"For those interested in the Second World War, or more specifically the Pacific War, this is a very good DVD, and most unusally it is in color - as the title indicates. However, I bought it for a more specific reason. I had seen the film on the 'History Channel' and noticed to my surprise that it included coverage of my brother's ship - HMS Swiftsure - anchored in a Japanese port. In October 1944, as the European War seemed to be heading towards a conclusion, a large British fleet was sent to the Pacific to take part in the advance on Japan; Swiftsure was part of that fleet. The DVD also provides coverage of the ships crew going ashore and meeting Japanese civilians, who allegedly were expecting the victors to massacre them. The ship was in Japan very soon after 'the Surrender'. My brother appears in the first shots of some officers and crew. The crew went on to help in the clean up of Hiroshima - which had experienced the first atomic bomb raid."
5,Excellent Metallurgical Reference in Non-Ferrous Metals,I think this book is unique in its content-no other book has such a comprehensive coverage in the metallurgy of non-ferrous metals. It is well written and has a pickupable easy to read style. Finding information on specific non-ferrous metals is very easy. The figures are also very clear.
3,Naughty sold out,"Naughty is still one of my favorite groups, but I think they are selling out by dropping hits that are so called ""commercial rap"" Check out their old album, they are much better..."
2,Not so good,I bought this in a bargain bin somewhere thinking it was nineteen naughty threen (my bad) boy was i dissapointed not much else to say 'cept its mediocre at best. Big Pun's (Legend R.I.P.) verse was really just acouple notches above weak please dont buy it. get nineteen naughty three instead.
3,They can do better,"For almost a decade, Naughty has been my favorite group. Before Biggie and Jay-Z mixed hard street flavor with radio friendly hip hop jams, there was the Illtown trio. But the problem with Nature's Fury is that they stray to much from the formula that made them so great. It's almost like they realized people were forgetting about them, so they employed a bunch of popular guests (Master P, Big Pun, Krayzie Bone) and adapted their sound to what is popular today. And it doesn't work. Fortunately, songs like ""Ring The Alarm"", ""Dirt All By Lonely"" and ""Radio"" stick to the old Naughty style and prove they still have it. So get back in the studio and bust out some hip hop JER-Z hits."
1,This is the weakest album I ever heard. Not classic Naughty,There is too much singing and not enough hard rap like usua
4,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK FOR THE BEGEINER,"THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK IF YOUR JUST STARTING OF. IAM ONLY SEVENTEEN AND THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK FOR ME TOO READ. IT TALKS ABOUT THE STUFF THAT IS REALLY OVER LOOKED LIKE NUTRITION(PROTEIN, CARBOHYDRATES, AND FATS). IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND THE DANGERS OF DRUGS, IT ALSO NAMES ALL THE ILLEGAL DRUGS THAT MOST PEOPLE USE FOR BODYBUILDING. THIS A REALL GOOD BEGEINERS BOOK."
4,Nice & Relaxing,I purchased this for my 16 month old daughter as a way to relax before bedtime. She loves all the other Baby Genius video's and this one didn't disappoint me at all. It's very relaxing and she loves to watch the children play-especially the scene at the beach. I would recommend this video for anyone who wants to calm their child down before nap or bedtime. She's only made it through the video a few times-she usually falls asleep before it's over.
3,Good Plot & Mystery,This was a pretty decent book about a mystery at a carnival. The brothers are surrounded with danger never knowing who is friend or foe. I liked that aspect of the book which only few seem to have. Cover at in 1968 of the originals began their demise with this volume. It is worth reading and ranks among the best of the higher volumes.
