3,Enjoy,While reading this book you'll have a good time. It's not a thriller or a love story. Simply is a story.
2,There are better books out there...,"Honestly, I felt like this book and it's sequel were not very interesting at all. There were parts that were really great of course, but by the end of the second book I was very, very bored. I would recommend reading Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings by Megan McCafferty. I have read both books several times and they never get old!"
2,Not that great.,"I've heard so much about this book, and waited 2 months to get it from my library. I read it, getting more and more frustrated. The writing was plodding, the plot was tired and stereotypical of a teenage book, and the only cool thing about the entire book was Lena's section. Tibby's bit was entertaining, but eventually got bogged down. This book had such a unique idea. In all honesty, Tibby and Lena's sections were tolerable. The other two characters I ended up hating."
4,"I've read better, but I""ve also read worse","After hearing so much about this book being SOOOO great from other people, I read it, expecting to be absolutely dazzled. But, I wasn't. It was good, but it definitely could have been better. The way it skips around from girl to girl, is on the borderline of confusing and cool."
3,lots of room,"I like this dvd case, however, the zipper is kind of hard to open and close. It is very durable and holds plenty of dvds."
4,Pretty good.,"Made chicken panang with it last night, and it was pretty tasty; you definitely need to add a few tablespoons of fish sauce (plain or hot), and more sugar than the recipe calls for. I hear that ""Hand"" brand panang paste is higher quality, so I'll give that a try the next time (not available here at Amazon, but Google ""Hand panang"" and several sources will come up)."
5,Awesome!,My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant with our 2nd child for several months now. I am 36 and am having moisture issues. Pre Seed was very nice to use and it made a lot of difference. We weren't successful with our first round of Pre-Seed but we are going to start our 2nd round soon so we are hoping it works this time.
5,The greatest product ever,Preseed definitly works. Me and my husband were trying to concieve only one month previous to using preseed. The second month we only used one tube on my peek ovulation and I got knocked up! This product is the business.
1,"If you have a choice, skip this one.","The most interesting thoughts in this book are presented when she accidentally describes someone else's idea succinctly.The book is shockingly-zalabakly poorly written. It is ironic that a book about communication is a such an embarrassingly messy thicket of thorny, tangled syntax.Or, to put it in the author's own words, ""Taken as a whole, these definitions and issues help us understand organizations from their structure and from the ways they continually create and change what they do and how they do it."" (Page 15)Shockley-Zalabak finds new and innovative ways to say nothing at all in the most circuitous, ham-fisted manner."
1,A difficult read,"This book is very difficult to read, so much so that I find myself having to close the door to avoid all distractions. My recommendation is to take notes as you read. I have had to go back and reread several sections. It's odd to me that this text was assigned for a communications course considering it is one of the most confusing books I have ever read. It lacks practical examples and is honestly quite boring. There are many other books that do a much better job of explaining organizational theories."
1,NEVER GOT IT!,I ordered it only to find out it would take 1-21 days to get it. It has been 27 days. I still do not have it!
2,Hardest to read textbook ever....,"I have this textbook for my Organizational Communications class and I have to admit this is one of the hardest to read textbooks I have ever come across. I know that textbooks are for learning but the author's verbose style does not seem to engage the reader and while it is probably one of the better books for the class it was intended to teach, the only engaging part of the book are the real world examples used. If you have to read this for a class, please dedicate extra time as you will be re-reading many of the pages and even then, the content might not sink in easily."
3,The Importance of Effective Organizational Communications,"This was a textbook for me. There are quite a few good approaches listed on how to resist, and confront conflict in the workplace. This book also offers some effective pointers for supervisors, managers, and other leaders of organizational communication. How do we shut down rumors? What kind of relationships are most effective between supervisors and their charges? I will use it as a reference book for creating sound communication training for classroom environments. [[ASIN:0205545955 Fundamentals of Organizational Communication: Knowledge, Sensitivity, Skills, Values (7th Edition)])"
1,"This was a need, not a want.","I needed this textbook for my Fundamentals of Organizational Communications class. UGH!! I hated this textbook. It is written too much like a scholarly paper with TONS of in-text citations and it was not edited properly. I would never recommend this book to anyone to read on a personal or professional level. If you have to take a course and this is the required textbook, be prepared to do lot of re-reading because the text is extremely dense and the author fills the books with sentences that are extremely long and distracting with definitions in parenthesis right in the sentence. I cannot count how many times I fell asleep reading this text and I LOVE to read. I cannot wait to sell this book because I will not even keep it for a reference."
4,Communications help for the grown ups in the room!,"This is a book that can be used effectively over many stages as the organization begins to grow in better communication skills. It doesn't ""dumb down"" for the reader but it is very accesible and can be used to guide your organization as well as to learn for yourself Keep it handy."
1,Diesel 10 Means Trouble,"I completely agree with ""mtr22's"" review of the book. Diesel 10 is scary in the book and the author uses the word ""hate""...not something I want to teach my 3-year old. After reading it once, I returned it to the store (I didn't purchase it from Amazon)."
5,Buy this book,"I do agree with some of the other reviews that Tess and Mark's second book, Beer Captured, is much better than this one, but this is still a great book. Especially if you are interested in brewing some lesser known beers of the world. This book is worth it for the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale recipe alone!"
3,Likely to disappoint all-grain brewers,"This book is clearly focused on the intermediate level brewer using extracts and specialty grains. The all-grain ""equivalent"" recipes ignore important variables like conversion temperatures (every recipe specifies a 150F rest) and mash thickness. I was also disappointed that measurable statistics (O.G., IBUs) do not always match what is reported by the breweries. For example, the Sierra Nevada website shows the O.G. for their Pale Ale to be 1.052, yet this book suggests a noticeably stronger 1.056. Such verifiable discrepancies erode my confidence in the rest of the book's accuracy. However, given the reduced level of control inherent to extract brewing, this book provides a very good starting point for intermediate brewers seeking to emulate certain commercial beers."
1,do not buy this as a computer power backup,"I purchased this to back up my desktop PC since we live in the mountains and have frequent power outages - many of them only for seconds.This unit is worthless for that purpose since it has too long a latency period for the power to transfer to the computer with a brief outage, and the computer still crashes.Check out other brands, and compare latency intervals for the power to kick in."
1,Short lifespan,"I Purchased the 900VA model based on its features. some outlets on battery back-up, others just on surge protection. LCD display looked good with my entertainment center. Used it way under 900 VA rating. TV and DVD recorder were the only two devices on battery back-up. Unit lasted 11 months. Came home to find unit dead, no ac voltage out of battery back-up outlets. No repairs offered by manufactuter. This is a disposable item."
1,Died early!,"Mine just died 2 minutes ago, thought i'd let potential customers know this doesn't last long. A little over 2 years old and the little replace battery sign came on along with an annoying beep. Now I have to hope we don't loose power until I buy a replacement. Don't know about the warranty but shipping this is going to not make it worth it. I will buy another brand. I bought this one because the Monster Cable one got bad reviews."
1,light duty !!!,"this item is certainly not hvy duty. the alum beam is, it is quite durable but the light duty very brittle plastic head is poorly riveted on and looks like we are going to have to be careful not to break it on the first use !"
3,Don't like the image quality,"I bought this product mainly for playing console games on my pc.The good news is that there is no lag at all when playing games.They played fine.My only complain is that supposedly this product has to deliver better image quality than a regular TV.It's written in the box.I know console games are low-res compared to pc standards,but I know it can look better.This product is a great solution if you want to play games mainly in your laptop,the device is little,so you can take it anywhere.I watched TV and it was fine.It's usb powered,that's good if you want more portability."
5,What I Expected,"I read previous reviews before ordering, so I knew to order the charger cord at the same time. Everything works as expected. No problem."
5,works great,no problems here. must be purchased with Streamlight (STL22311) 120 Volt AC charger cord. For some reason they dont specify that anywhere
4,Its a DVD book,"I thought it was a CD book, but no... It is a DVD book, so there is a place to put a full size picture of the movie on one side and the dvd on the other side.Look at the picture very closely.The book is constructed well."
5,This is a very anounted Viedo,I think Carman is the best Christian Singer around I really appreciate is heart for Souls!!! I have been to alot of Carmans Concerts and I will tell you that his Concerts of very anounited because I have seen Millions of people come to know Christ at all of his concerts!!!
4,still funny and still satirical,"collects x-statix #1-5. story arc focuses on mysterious fan boy, a mutant obsessed with u-go girl and upset over her death. the group has personal tensions (of course) and a rival group called the ""o-men"". highlights include a ""steamy"" scene in x-statix's community shower, venus dee milo joins, and a mutant named corkscrew makes his appearance and quickly meets his demise ... at the hands of doop?!"
2,live in aught 3,"a disappointing outing for mcmurtry. the songs are mediocre and the mix is clogged. the 2005 release, ""childish things"" is a much better album, solid all the way through and featuring the trenchant showstopper, ""we can't make it here anymore""."
5,Aught Naught Be Missed,"Some beer salesmen do their very best work in beer halls. McMurtry's one of 'em. Joe Ely's another. Ely's ""Live at Liberty Lunch"" and this disc have settled that issue for the time being.I got turned onto ""Live in Aught-Three"" by a good photographer from Missoula during the Miles City Bucking Horse Sale this year. I like to occasionally play it for the folks at intermission on Friday nights during the open mic event. The energy level always goes up during ""Choctaw Bingo"" and ""Lights of Cheyenne"" settles everyone down.There's not a bad cut on this thing and, for me, that's the measure of the music I'll buy."
5,Beautifully written! Truly a pleasure...,"Sabriel is a beautiful book. Garth Nix is truly a master of writing and this spell-binding fantasy shows off his true talents. A young girl, named Sabriel, is thrust into the adult role of a necromancer. With hardly any practice but a lot of courage, she sets off to save her father... Faced with many evils she somehow gets through and picks up friends along the way. The cat Moggot and the young man Touchstone bring new light to the novel. I read this book at least once every three months, and it was a favorite since my first read. I cannot wait for the sequel and I am sure other readers feel the same way..."
5,Buy it now,"Sabriel is one of those girl-power fantasy books that isn't meant just for teenage girls (but also totally makes us feel awesome just by reading it). It's a great coming-of-age story, a good what-do-I-do-after-graduation tale, and just an all around I'm-so-happy-I-read-this-again book. I don't know why you're still reading this, just buy the book already. You're going to read and reread and want to rereread it and you'll want the book handy when that need hits you."
4,A little repetitive,"The main character- Sabriel, is tired 9/10 of the entire book. Just wanted to point that out."
5,One of the best written fantasy novels I've ever read!,"I love this book. Fast-paced and extremely engaging I couldn't put it down. It's hard to create a world and characters on paper and make them seem so real and believable, that when you see or read that you know a truly awsome writer has been born. For people who enjoy fast-paced fantasy adventure like Harry Potter and the Artemis Fowl Trilogy will enjoy this series."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I picked this up without any recommendation, it just looked interesting (maybe because it was read by Tim Curry, who did an excellent job). I didn't expect much, probably because of the cover quote by Philip Pullman, whose Amber Spyglass I despised; on the other hand, it was also recommended by Lloyd Alexander, of whom I am a fan. The writing got off to rocky start, but I was instantly (and continually) intrigued with the setting. Despite much of the story being set in a superficially standard medieval fantasy land, Nix has added other elements to the setting that result in a creative and original story with likeable protagonists and an interesting plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading Lirael next."
3,Starts lame but gets good,"Positives: Unique setting, variety of magical systems, and plot. Also, most of these elements build up, starting quite weak(unfortunately), but ending strongly. The ending also brings good resolution and a strong climax.Negatives: Lots of poor plotting and wasted words, especially in the first hundred pages. Characters are fairly weak throughout, and even the most interesting ones fall flat. Also, the story seems downright heavy-handed where life and death are concerned, slaughtering off important people without so much as a condolence note. It has some element of realism to it, but it's too extreme and too unemotional to work well. Most magical elements are explained and handled well, but the ones with Mogget, especially at the ending, just jump forward without any sort of explanation. The novel mostly just drags on too long.Overall: Sabriel is unique and interesting, worth reading once, but probably not worth buying or re-reading."
5,One of the best YA fantasy trilogies,"I read Sabriel a few years after it first came out... I was a kid at the time, growing up in the thick of Harry Potter fever, and there were tons of fantasy novels on the shelves. I remember being really struck by the uniqueness of Sabriel even back then, and how it dealt with death in this beautiful, poetic way. It also helped having a badass female lead.Fast forward many years later, and I find myself returning to Sabriel again and again. Even as an adult, the book still resonates with me, and I honestly appreciate the way it handles Death and the zombie-like creatures in a way that's thoroughly unclichéd in today's ""post apocalyptic bloodbath"" trend.Honestly, in the time since I first read Sabriel, and now, I've read more fantasy novels and comics than most people should. I work as an animator and a writer. And I'm still so impressed by Nix's world building and characters. It holds up as one of the best fantasy novels of the last couple of decades."
5,My Favorite Book in the Series,I have read all the books in the series and this is definately the best. Sabriel lives in a world where the dead dont stay dead and one person (her father) keeps them dead. Her Dad gets stuck in death and she has to go in to the Old Kingdom to rescue him. The series is amazing and should be seen by anybody who is a fan of fantasey.
2,I liked other books by this author,But this one was boring and repetitive. I finished it but it was painful. It took a long time to get to an unspectacular ending
3,"Okay, but not the best of Diane Chamberlain","This was not my favorite Diane Chamberlain book. I felt it was slower paced than her other books, and it took me a while to get into it. Secret Lives, and Breaking the Silence kept me wanting more, while this one kept my attention, but was nothing extraordinary. It is a little hard to believe, and I never like that in a book."
3,Cute School house; child not interested.....,"I am disappointed not in the product but in my granddaughter's lack of interest. She will go in one end of the little school house to chase one of my kitties, and then come out the other...she is not interested in sitting inside or playing inside it at age 20 months, so I am thinking the age range perfect for this may be 3 years old and up. The first time we stored it, the pack away was easy; but the second time my husband could not get the school house to fold away like the first time. I have to give three stars overall."
3,Good reference book,"Spend over ten hours going over the book as soon as I got, found it very well written and filled with simple examples. I have been using SAS for two years including few SAS functions like time and date, statistical and others. Good book for beginner programmer like me.Don't know how useful this would be for people with extensive SAS experience."
2,"Many Songs, One Background Track","This extensive collection of German songs of childhood is quite thorough, with about 60 titles on 3 CDs. The words are clear and distinguishable; and the children and occasional adult who are singing (all German, not English)have quite good voices, and sing in tune. I was hoping to find a song I had heard the Vienna Boy Choir do long ago. That cut is on the album (Trara Die Post Ist Da), but I was sorely disappointed in the rendition offered; all of these songs, even lullabies, have a ridiculous computerized techno-beat track for accompaniment. Sorry for those poor kids who are good enough singers, but have their recording marred by this annoying background noise.If you are just looking for language instruction, and you can stand the keyboard synthesizer, it may be helpful to your child; also, the lyrics (German, no English) are included in a pamphlet."
5,Passions Blood-Wonderful!,"As a big fan of Cherif Fortin for starters and his partner Lynn Sanders, how could I not enjoy this book? The artwork is amazing and so lifelike as you read through the hot, passionate story of the love between Emric and Leanna. I laughed, I cried, I felt the stab of the sword as Emric fights in his battles and Leanna is forced to wait for her love. A must for any romance reader, a big must for any fan of Cherif and Lynn's artwork as well. WOW!"
4,Great stories,I grew up as a big fan of Rick Monday when he played for the Cubs. Monday's Tales book follows the same format as most of the Tales books. I like Monday's above the average because he intersperses great insight and stories of his own season. These books are great for getting inside glimpses of the teams. Monday gives us a better than average look.
2,"Worth a library checkout , nto to actually purchase","This was a weak book to start off in hardcover. When I read Unleash the Night (which was the first book I read i nthe series) I became intrigued, and began to readall of the rest of the books in the series. Now with Dark Side of the Moon. I was a little dissapointed. A lot of the other stories made my heart ache. This one however did not.It was a little harder for me to jump into this book as well because they set it in Seattle, and all the other characters were interconnected in New Orleans.Im hoping that Kenyon develops the other stories betterthan this book. Especially since she says that she has a lot more ideas and a lot more books to go.I would give it 2 1/2 if I was able"
1,I am not satisfied,I ordered this book over a month ago. The payment was deducted from my account but I still have not received this book. I have never had this poor a service from any Amazon provider and will never order from this person again.
1,Terrible....I want my money and time back...,I could not get into this book. I am very disappointed in this story. Can we say boring. The main characters were boring. The Ash/Nick storyline sucked. I would like this series to come to an end so we can finally get Ash's story told. After a while it becomes the same old story over and over again. I don't think I will buy any more of the Dark Hunter series. Very disappointing!!!!!!!!!
1,Just bad,"Some of Ms. Kenyon's books are interesting enough - plot wise - to plow through her generally mediocre writing. This one is boring and confusing, and the writing is wretched. For example, she writes ""Urian, on the other hand, was a constantly festering wound that ate at him."" As far as I know, festering is an all or nothing proposition, and wounds don't eat. Evidently Ms. Kenyon gets paid by the excessive unoriginal mixed metaphor. It would be one thing if this were an isolated example, but its not. So, don't bother with this book."
2,Let down again ...,"I'm just about finished reading ""Kenyon"" forever. I've read all of her books and this last book was convoluted, boring and just not up to her usual writings with the exception of her ""Uniform"" tomes, which are just bad.Check out ""Dance with the Devil,"" ""Night Embrace"" and ""Fantasy Lover,"" you'll just love these booksSherrilyn, I'm very disappointed."
1,Boring,Ditto the previous reviews. I hate to say it was unbelievable. It is a fantasy book for heavens sake! But Kenyon's characters are usually engaging enough for me to suspend reality. Not this one.
2,"I love Sherri, but DSOTM really did suck","I love Sherri. I have met her, spoken with her, and realized that she is an amazing writer and person. However, this book really did suck. Her last good book was Sins of the Night and that had some ""iffy"" parts too it, but it was still a 3.5 star book.DSOTM leaves the reader wanting more story, but petrified to spend money on the next book. I know I will buy her next book in hardcover, but I will be leery. This book is definately worth reading if you are a dark hunter fan and want to keep up with their world. However, if you are a new Sherri fan, go read one of the first five or six novels...you have to know what is going on in order to follow DSOTM.Sherri, your world is fantastic, you are surperb...but your stories need more..."
2,disappointed,I also had a hard time reading this book and had to force myself to read it as well. I thought about just stopping the book and going on to another but I felt I needed to finish. I didn't feel as invested in these characters as I did with ones in the past. I also feel that Ravyn needed to be more developed. I do not feel that this book is necessary to read for the series.
4,This is a cool little book,"My friend lent me this book and I got so much out of it. There is a lot of wisdom in it for balancing yourself or figuring out where you need balance even if you just look at it from a psychological point of view. The author even includes archetypes, like the warrior vs. the servant, etc to better understand yourself. She also includes some very simple and easy to do meditations. I hate meditating but these were really simple, and I feel more relaxed after doing them so they work. Anything that promotes relaxation while being present with your body in this crazy world is a plus Also the affirmations are a short little exercise that can make you feel good too. You won't know unless you try!What's also great about the book is every chakra has a page dedicated to little factoids about it like the angels associated with it, color, musical note,glandular connection and much more. It's written simply and concisely, and she doesn't waste any words."
5,over 100 different project plans,"This book has detailed plans including materials list and photographs of the finished project. Sections divided into Tables and Desks, Chairs Benches and Beds, Cabinets and Storage, Accents and Accessories. Lots of shaker style pieces."
1,"Zoom, zoom","After three days of use, the lens became locked outside the case, and even with a set of charged batteries, there was no power to the camera. Now, rather than enjoy the camera, the person we gave it to is faced with having to fork out money to have it returned for factory repair. I wish we could say something about the picture quality in this review, but we never advanced far enough to enjoy pictures retrieved from the unit. I usually buy Canon. This was my first Nikon."
5,Great value!!,The camera was for my daughter. She loves it. I am impressed and will try to buy another. My wife has used it also and she loves the simplicity of it. The quality of photos and the ease of operation and the $$$ make it a great value.CT Garner
1,Image Stability Issues,"Nice form factor, low price, but the painfully long latency from shutter click to actual snap of the photo means that most of my photos are blurry. I have had a series of Canon's that have just as many features and not this latency issue. After getting back home and seeing most of my trip photos blurry (imperceptible on the LCD viewer, but painfully obvious on the desktop monitor), I put this thing on the shelf and went shopping for another. In the scheme of things, I would rather pay $50 more and know my photos will be usable.I am extremely disappointed in this product. I expect more from Nikon."
4,Very Good,"Finaly I have this CD, I've been searching for it for over a few years know. The quality is ok and the tracks that are on it to. Thanks."
3,"Hey Mr. Carsen, where's Rome?","I purchased this performance on the merits of Jonas Kauffman, but I found Robert Carsen's concept an insurmountable and irritating obstacle. I could listen to this performance, but I can't stand watching it. Puccini's opera is so Roman and so Catholic--even if critically so--that to make no visual reference even to a church or a procession in the San Andrea del Valle act renders it senseless. Where was the ""Madonna al manto"" to which Tosca "" diedi su gioielli""? And of course Mario's painting of Mary Magdalen has to be bare-breasted. I guess Luc Bondi set the standard at the Met. For this reason I give this DVD only three stars, and they are for the singers and orchestra. Mr. Carsen, you get a lump of coal in your stocking!"
2,Batteries drain even when turned OFF,"Decent performance, size and price. But if you use it only occasionally then every time you pick it up the batteries will be dead/low. Scene mode seems very susceptible, it always thinks the batteries are low after 20 shots or a week of being off. Been through 10 sets of batteries of all different brands, and the battery type is set correctly in setup. Would avoid, other cameras seem to have same problem so research carefully.Update: Using the Eneloop brand of rechargeable battery (and using setup to signify so) solved the battery issue. We now get hundreds of shots on a single charge, even when using the flash. Camera seems to have an issue only with Alkaline batteries."
2,Not a very great camera.,"Don't expect that you are going to get great picture quality for this price. The photos doesn't look bright enough in the LCD. camera menu's are OK to use. If you are looking for really good camera, consider buying Canon SD series.."
2,Hell to pay.... hard to watch,"I picked this movie up because I love westerns. When the film started, I could tell I was in trouble as the production values seemed to be lacking and some wooden dialogue delivered during the stagecoach hold-up. Once I accepted the level of feature I was watching, I adjusted my expectations and tried to accept Hell to Pay for the low budget 60s or 70s TV western that it really is. There are some good action scenes in the film, and the old western town is authentic (there is a nice bonus feature on the DVD regarding the classic western back-lots). Lee Majors was billed as a co-star in Hell to Pay, but he really only makes a cameo. See it if you are a true oaterphile, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."
4,Good thrill ride,"Charlie Fox is a great combination of edgy and wacky. She finds herself in a dangerous situation and handles her charge and those that come up against them efficiently. I'd hire her as a bodyguard any time. The writing needs a bit of tightening, but the plot line and characters make it worth a read."
4,They are the cutest!,The Pixar Cars Movie Moments (whoever the character might be) are the cutest toys on earth! I bought one for myself (to put in our TV room) and got them as well for my nephews! They totally love it! They've collected almost all of the characters in the CARS movie and this is definitely a great addition to their collection and playtime! :)
1,Milk toast,Average musicians with bland vocals. What else can I say? Carry oke me back to the blues with emotions please.
2,Lousy Quisinart Quailty,"At least I gor a few years out of my first bowl. This one (which, by the way, has a black handle) has a spring release that's already sticking. It's hard to find bowls to fit this processor, which is one of Cuisinart's most expensive. I remember when Cuisinart was THE name in food processors -- they shouod be embarassed to put their name on these bowls."
4,Sheep hits the Playstation screen!!,"Im Selling this game, and I like it, but I don't like a race 'hurry up before time runs out' game. So thats why I gave it a 4-star rating. You can pick from 4 herders and ya gotta herd the little sheepies in the pen before time runs out. I'm on level 2. I don't like the part if they get hurt or drown."
1,"Not for male survivors, or anyone who has been abused by a woman","I am a male incest survivor, and I got this book because the Courage to Heal For Women was very helpful to me; there aren't that many books for male survivors. This author has some good things to offer; it's unfortunate that the book gets clouded by her prejudice. [...] Myself and many people I know from recovery (including women) were sexually abused by their mothers or other women without any man being involved. She also insinuates that boys don't often get sexually abused. Wrong. Sexual abuse against boys is much less reported. I support anyone writing a book for female survivors, but there is no need to take shots at boys who have been sexually abused, and it's shameless to not hold female perpetrators accountable for what they have done. Any adult, male or female is responsible for their own actions."
5,Great Product,"I am use to usingMeguiar's G-7016 Gold Class Clear Coat Wax Liquid. 16 oz.andMeguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0 (18-Ounce Liquid)to do my automobiles. Pinnacle Liquid Souveran Wax used with16oz. Pinnacle Crystal Mist Carnauba Detail Spray Waxdoes a somewhat better job: (1) it gives a better more brilliant shine, (2) easy to remove - does not harden like the Maquirers so buffing is simplified, (3) you use very little product - one ounce or less to do a normal vehicle, (you will use more Maquirers and not receive as good a shine),(4) since I just applied it I have not tested its durability, but from what I understand it should last 3-4 months. You will like the liquid look."
5,Like going to a spa,This product is SO easy and smells wonderful. No sore arms because you don't have to buff it off. The smell makes you feel like your on a tropical vacation. What more could you want?
3,Interesting--But With All the Scarey Details Left Out,"Get this tape, but don't expect anything startling. The aged ex-bodyguard is careful to speak only about silly stuff: Stalin catching a worker taking a bath in his private bath house, Stalin giving lifts in his limousine to people standing at a bus stop, etc. Occassionally the mask drops, as when the old man refers to managing a string of Moscow informants. Then his eyes turn steely, which fifty years before must have been bone-chilling. The tape ends with him teaching his accordion technique to a gaggle of gradeschool children. Bizarre."
2,"Too thick, too pinguinish",Not too happy with these - they are thick and kinda cheap-looking. Would not recommend.
5,This Is The Game,"This game has it all. The graphics, the gameplay the simulation of the real thing. The only con is that the players really don't look like their counterparts. Other than that this game is very very good. You won't probably listen to me because I am 13 yrs old but I know what im talkin about. I really like to control my swing so this is the game for me. It has made some major improvements from the '03 game but this is the SHIZNIT"
1,GET ESPN 2k4 baseball,THIS GAME MVP BASEBBALL 2004 IS NOTHING WORTH BUYING AND I WONT BUY IT AGAIN. THE BATTING SUCKS I SPENT HOURS JUST MESSING WITH THE STICK TO BAT!!!!! BY ESPN BASEBALL 123 AND YOUR BATTING. THE GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT THE PITCHING AND BATTING SUCKS SO MY FELLOW BASEBALL FANS GO TO THE STORE AND GET ESPN THE 1 GAME
5,Addictive fun,"I can't seem to put the controller down. This is my first baseball game purchase in a long while and I am glad I bought it. I have already gone through one full season (lost in divisional round with the Phillies) of dynasty mode and am in my 2nd season about 40 games in (19-17 record, 3.5 games back). EA sports really got this one right.Sure there is a glitch or two, but believe me the pros far outweigh the cons.This game is a must have for the baseball purists."
4,?,how can you hit a homer? i played more then three times and can't get a homer. Please tell me if you know?
3,Still has irritating glitches,"I bought this pricey game for my son and me to play together. Overall it is a pretty good game. However, one glitch that drives me crazy is some batters are called out after just fouling off one ball- so with just one strike they are out. It's hard enough for a five year old to learn the ins and outs of baseball without irritating nonsense like that happening at random. For me it would be a fabulous game if some of the snafus like this are fixed"
4,good game with some flaws,i suggest you rent this game first because there are so many different baseball games to choose from. this one to me is the best availible because the graphics are by far better than any other. one flaw that has frustrated me is the outfielders for the other team make every catch. especially the twins they catch everything with style.pros- great graphicsimproved hitting and pitchinganimations are improvedcons- way to many triplesfrom pro to allstar is a big jump in difficultygets boring
2,this game sucks,this game is a waste of time and money it is only fun when playing on manager mode. The minor league thing was cool but still I am bitter because the A teams from leagues like the South Atlantic league were not in the game. get MLB Baseball it is a much better game
4,Realistic plyers and stadiums make for top quality game,I bought this game over the 2005 version mainly due to the price difference. It is definetely worth it for the price. The quality of graphics and gameplay are superb. The different possibilities in this game are endless. I play it on a regular basis in the franchise mode and I'm only half way through my first season. If you are big baseball fan this is the game for you.
2,MVP Baseball,"I have to give this 2 ratings.Two stars for gameplay because it it HARD unless you enjoy (...).Five stars for the ""total package"".Its got great graphics & is jam packed with features,even classic uniforms.My first baseball game to include that.Overall Im glad I bought it.Just have to get better at playing it."
2,Can't handle pet hair,"This vacuum has been a two year disappointment. It has good suction, powerful motor, wide sweep, and good attachment performance - but it cannot handle pet hair. Long before the dust chambers are full, and usually about 5 minutes into use, clumps of pet hair start forming around the dual chrome cones at the top of each cyclone chamber. The hair then gets tangled around the cones, which then have to be removed in order to wrangle the hair free.Dust, dirt, and small debris empty easily, as advertised. Just a bush of a button, and everything drops from the dust chamber into the trash. If you have long-hair pets, however, I would avoid this vacuum altogether. I called Dirt Devil customer service just to see if they had a different cone design that wouldn't clog after 5 minutes of use, but they could only refer me to a warranty service center. Sadly, I think this design is flawed."
3,prestons review,i have this toy at home and i love playiny with it but my babybrother takes it away.. i love toy story and buzz thezy are my favorit
5,"Dragonball Rocks, Goku Rocks.","check it out the listing says ""tree of might"" but the picture is ""dead zone"" but both are great Dragonball Z movies i've got both of them and ""world's strongest"". These moives make you want NO NEED more Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT"
3,"Cool, but few surprises","It was great to see the DragonBall Z characters in their original language. Gokou's voice, as provided by Masako Nozawa, is a whole new world for the Occidental otaku who have loved the series with a more masculine voice. Nevertheless, the plot is not new: you have seen it somehow in the series, with different names and situations. Besides, the villain in this movie, Garlic Jr., is a demon who will scare small children when he confronts even God (Kami). Good for the experience of japanese voices."
5,FUNimation's best piece of work.,"A great movie. All the original content was kept in from the original Japanese version (""Return my Gohan."") Dead Zone is a very exciting movie with lots of action, comedy, and in-depth storyline. If you're a true Dragon Ball Z fan, you'll love this!"
2,Reveiw from the great Oozari,"Like all DBZ movies,this was pretty good,but I've seen better.One of the worst things is that there's barely any music,and Goku's voice sounded awfull.The best part in the movie was when Gohan sent Garlic Jr. into the dead zone.It was gross but funny how Krillin found Gohan in the uncut virsion.If you saw it you'll know what I mean."
4,Better than the other two (English) movies...,This was the first DBZ movie I saw and I bought the uncut theaterical version...It was enjoyable to watch and it was better than the other two (english)...now why do I keep saying (english)? That's because there are ten other movies...someone else mentioned this but what he didn't mention was where you can find them....If you can put yp with a lot of reading b/c of subtitles then go to this site and it has all the movies plus some other DBZ rarities (including Japanese episodes not seen in the US yet)...the site is www.sbgiftsandhobbies.com...enjoy
3,Great Book!,"Hi, I am working at ILISA Spanish Language Institute in San Jose, Costa Rica and I just want to let you know that this book help our students a lot by giving them helpful tips and by making any travel plans for the weekends. Thanks!"
2,weak blender,"I would simply expect a blender to blend smoothies and crush ice, but this product doesn't work well at either of those things. It is very slow at mixing a smoothie/milkshake, and I have to stop several times to push the ingredients down with a spoon because this blender doesn't blend them, except in the bottom 2 inches of the container. I'm going to give mine away and try the Oster Beehive blender - I've used one before and it worked well. I haven't used the food processor, but based on other people's reviews, I think I'll give that away too and get a real one.Don't waste your money - look elsewhere for a blender."
4,Disappointed.,"I love this show, but it seems this fun little show about vampires has become over-run with witches, fairies, mediums, shapeshifters, werewolves. Don't get me wrong; I like some of the characters, but can we get back to the vampires, please?"
3,Tru Blood,"I have read through a lot of the previous reviews and have found that most people who have issues with this show, they have a problem with it not being exactly what is in the book series. Do people really want to read a book and then see that exact story on film? Wouldn't that make it really boring knowing everything that is about to happen? That would take away all thrill and excitement for you already know what is going to happen. I do agree that season 4 has really lost its direction and now, on season 5, it seems like its only getting worse. I have a feeling its not going to make it past season 5. Tru Blood has been a fantastic view on vampires and is definitely a lot better then most other vampires shows/ movies out today (Such as Twilight which was the worse vampire movie EVER! Sparkling in the sun really? - Ground breaking). Hopefully they get back to making the show good like in season 1, 2 , and 3, otherwise just cancel it now and save everyone the wasted time."
3,Gets More Unusual,After last season I didn't think the series could get any weirder. Then they came out with this season. Odd doesn't even describe it.
3,my disc 3 won't play! ugh!,Disappointed because disc 3 keeps reading 'no disc detected!!!!! Now i don't want to watch the rest bc Im going to be lost!!!!!
5,Awesome (Of Course),"This is an awesome show, and there is never an episode that I don't totally enjoy. This episode, of course, lives up to those expectations! Great picture and sound."
5,Just in Time,"At first i wasn't sure if i should buy the blue ray dvd set or this item, but i am happy i chose this item. It works perfectly; the image and sound are great."
2,Freezing Episodes,I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law. Her husband informed me that the last episode freezes entirely and cannot be watched as well as the last half of the second to last episode. I was not happy to hear this and was somewhat embarrassed
2,no for me,"I dislike the sex, it is boring to see over and over. The books were great., but the producers needed to be sensational. I gave away and did not watch"
4,"Vampires, Witches, & Werewolfs Oh My!","I'm a fan of both the TV series and the books, and as the show progresses it goes farther and farther from the books, but that isn't really a bad thing. In the fourth season there is the usual amount of vampire and werewolf drama, but now adds witches to the mix as well. I loved the casting of Fiona Shaw this season. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but I really liked the storylines for Jessica this season, as well as Sookie spending her time with someone other then Bill. The one really weak point of the season, in my opinion, was Tara, as it didn't really seem like she fit anywhere inparticular."
2,"Boring, lame. slow paced,","Boring, lame. slow paced, terrible acting. Paris Hilton's scary House of Wax was a masterpiece compared to this.This show had potential, but it gets lost in it's attempt to sell itself better by sticking in a ridiculous amount of sex and nudity. I honestly felt like I was watching a porno with a plot thrown in as an afterthought. It has it's good points, though. It got some laughs out of me with it's cheesy humor, and the characters are generally likable. As I said earlier, it has the potential to be absolutely great."
2,Broken after 1.5 months,"Not only did the clip holster fall off of my hip several times when I stood from a seated position (one time costing me $90 by breaking the screen), but the whole clip device has now cracked off after only about 1.5months of use.Convienient, yes. Durable or safe, no."
3,Screen faces out; clip WAY too fragile,"This is a good idea. However, it is poorly executed. The first problem is that the case only allows you to put the PDA into it with the screen facing out. This is a great way to put scratches on your screen. The second problem is the rigid but flimsy clip. I think I broke this clip within 2 hours of placing it on my person. My hack fix was to scavange a cheap leather cell phone case for it's leather-covered metal belt clip. I cut this out of the cell phone case and attached it to the case with epoxy. This design functioned well but failed to address the exposed screen issue so I stopped using it. However, it DID solve the belt clip issue quite nicely."
3,No problems here,"I bought my belt clip one month ago, I work as a computer hardware technician and climb under desks. The case stays firmly on my belt and it doesnt slide. In the car I never have a problem either of it sliding off so far as i wear my coat on top of it. So to date I havent had any problems. As far as it matching my blue visor deluxe who cares..it stays snug in the case and thats all that matters to me."
1,Lasted 12 Days,"I think that the title says it all. Nice style, but way to flimsy. The spring in the clip isn't strong enough, and the clip is held on with two molded pins about 1/16th of an inch long by 1/16th in diameter. I wish that I could suggest a better case to use in it's place, but I'm still looking."
2,Thought it would be dope....I was wrong.,"Like other reviewers, I needed a place to attach my PDA to my body (conjure up images of Borg) but this did little to satisfy my need. The clip snapped and ""WHAM"", down went my Visor.Funny how I trusted a $20 piece of plastic to support my $300 Visor. The only saving grace was that Amazon agreed to ship me out a new one even after my 30 day purchase grace period had passed.If you do buy this item, just take extra caution when getting in/out of a chair with armsrests. Chairs seem to have a remarkable taste for this little cheap plastic morsel."
1,False advertising...no database information,"I wish I had read other reviews before ordering this book. The cover falsely states ""Includes database connectivity"". It does not! There does not appear to be anything relating to JDBC, ODBC, database, or connectivity (which was my chief interest in ordering it). Furthermore many pages are wasted in repeating the same (largely autogenerated) code."
5,PBS special: one of the best,"I teach a genocide and hate awareness class. As a teacher, this documentary outstrips other videos concerning the atrocities in Rwanda. So many of our kids have seen Hotel Rwanda. Not that it is bad, but it was edited by the director to not be as graphic as it could have been, and many of the key characters were changed, such as Gen. Dallaire into Nick Nolte's character.The Ghosts of Rwanda interview many key people, from Dallaire to Kofi Annan, to the only American left in Rwanda to Hutu farmers who participated in the killings. It is the most indepth coverage that I can find. I would recommend it to anyone wanting information on the Rwandan genocide."
5,Easy Install!,Top quality item & very easy to install. Installation on my early '99 F350 took only 10 minutes for each one. The toughest part was removing the junk they were replacing. I highly recommend the conversion.
5,They work,"What can you say, they work. I've had them on my Excurssion for over a year now and they are still working great. They lock and unlock with an easy turn of the dial."
1,Beware!!!!,"This book CLAIMS that it can enlighten you as to what a TRUE satanist believes. If you are thinking about purchasing this book, don't. If you are seriously curious about Satanism, stay away from this book. If you want to know what Christians THINK satanism is about, or what Wiccans/Neopagans THINK Satanism is about, this is the book for you.Here's the TRUTH about Satanism:Satanists only use the name 'Satan' because it scares you.Satanists have only one rule: Question Everything.There is only one person who has written about Satanism with complete honesty, that person was Anton Lavey. Read the Satanic Bible if you want to know the truth."
1,Everyone but Charlie...,"Recently bought this DVD, excited to catch any available glimpse of jazz guitar innovator Charlie Christian in action. Watched the whole thing, and I'm still waiting. If this ""movie"" is any indicator, there must not be any film footage of him in existence. This video is a mere 31 minutes long, and consists of a whole slew of known and unknown people who knew or admired Charlie, each putting in their two cents' worth (if that). In short, all talk and NO ACTION. This video might as well have been a book. The closest we get to ""The Genius of Charlie Christian"" are four audio tracks selectable from the bonus material---c'mon, any audio CD beats that! While some of the interviewees are interesting, jazz guitar veteran Herb Ellis for example, others are nearly incoherent and some are clearly reciting their ""lines"" from a script! So, don't waste your money folks. If anybody knows of a video with any real live footage of C.C. playing, please post info here!"
4,good book,The Transformers: Book 3 is a good book. It came a few days before the appointed time frame of delivery.
3,Quick self-defense video.,"I gave this video 3 stars, because Master Tsai does make some valid points. I feel this video is too quick paced and too short for the amount of money you pay for it. I have his 2 videos and basically it shows you where to aim for the weak parts of the attacker and how to try to get away. Master Tsai deomonstrates on his students, which is really funny to watch! It is very good for a laugh. Sorry Master Tsai, but you really need to add more drills into the video to make it much better."
3,Salt shaker fills from the bottom,"I really like the appearence of this set, but when the salt ran out, and I had to refill, I discovered that the top of the salt shaker does not unscrew. So you have to tape over the holes in the top, turn it upside down, and pry off a rubber stopper to fill it. Why not make it so that the top uncrews? The pepper mill fills from the top so why not the salt shaker? Seems like a poor design to me."
3,This is older British Light Music...,"But that's OK. This British Light Music CD is more fun than most of the other CDs, and there are some pretty good tracks. Some of the tracks are very Laurel and Hardyish, but...If you are looking for incidental (background) music used in Monty Python's Flying Circus, then look elsewhere, because on this CD it is RIGHT OUT!"
5,Brilliant!,"Too bad this movie has been discontinued because it's absolutely brilliant. I saw it many years ago on TV but I don't own the DVD and I wish I had it. I hope the manufacturer, whoever he is, will change his mind...soon!"
1,"Info.Given Wrong Not a 10"" Pan","When I received this pan I checked the information liner for size and it stated plainly that this is a 9"" pan. Your information all states 10"" which is what I need and thought I was getting. Customer Service contacted and the pan was returned."
4,"Very good, writer is a hands on builder.","This book is a must have if you are even thinking of building a stone building. Great details with a clear picture of the work involved, and lots of heads up pointers. Could of used more pictures, the ones it had were all black and white. The only thing about this book I didn't like was it was written in 1991 and after 10 years some contruction methods change."
2,Apricots were OK but I not sure I would order them again.,I thought the packaging of the individual apricot was not very appealing eventhough in came in a gift box. I thought more should have been included. The number of apricots provided would have been a better indicator than weight.
5,Rave reviews!,"I order these chocolate covered apricots over and over again as gifts and for my own indulgence. Such plump and moist apricots---never dry or stringy in tecture. Love both the dark and milk chocolate dipped. Wish they had white chocolate, too. An assortment of milk, dark and milk chocolate dipped apricots would be even better!A Very Satisfied Customer"
3,Good Idea,"I like the idea of this Carabiner Tool. A non-load bearing carabiner is still handy, and the idea of a small knife/saw blade tucked into it seems very utilitarian. My problem is primarily that the knife, which is largely the biggest selling point of this tool, doesn't have a safety mechanism to lock it in place. A couple of times I've noticed it hanging off of my pack with the knife starting to open a bit, either from it's own movement, or rubbing against something on my pack. Very disconcerting. I'm going to have to put a tie around it just to make sure it stays put and doesn't cause an accident."
3,"Good idea, but not great","This is a nifty little item to have for the outdoors folk. As other reviews stated, this item still needs a little work. It feels sturdy, and everything opens and functions smoothly, except for the knife blade. It will not lock once opened unless you force it or snap it open with a firm flick of the wrist. If I can ever find a star screwdriver set with small enough heads, I may take it apart and file the locking mechanism down just a bit. That would fix it....Knife blade has a nice sharp factory edge."
1,No go,Spring on latch broke after 2 days on key chain. Wouldnt buy if this is going to be a monthy user
3,A little light in the features department.,"I purchased this receiver to replace a 15 year old Technics receiver that finally died on me, and I've always been a big fan of Panasonic brands but I was on a budget so I bought this one instead of the top of the line model that I really wanted. This receiver is a little light in the features department to be considered a ""Home Theater Receiver"". Lack of HDMI and component inputs really limits this for home theater. I also wished it had more aux speaker channels but not the showstopper. I have a set of JBL home theater speakers and this box drives them pretty well for movies but if you are into loud music with large floor standing speakers you'll be disappointed.For the money this is a really good product and for what I use it for it fit the bill."
1,A(completewasteoftime)ngelmass,"Honestly, complete rubbish. Paper thin characters and an even thinner plot. I picked this up in the library; had I paid for this I would be thoroughly pissed."
3,ceramic--- not unbreakable,"These are pretty- very heavy ceramic rather than the lightweight, unbreakable material the dinnerware is made from. That aspect disappointed me."
5,Really knows his stuff!,Joel Salatin really knows his stuff when it comes to making money from farming. He's developed his whole farming operation over decades and knows what works and what doesn't. Salad Bar Beef talks about the specifics of raising cattle on pasture rotation and marketing the healthier beef direct to consumers. It's a model I'll definitely emulate.
4,A really good read,"If you've seen video of, or read any of Joel Salatin's work then you will enjoy this book. I wish his ideas were more widely adopted."
5,Inspiring!,"SALAD BAR BEEF was the second I've read from this author, the first was YOU CAN FARM. The first book intrigued me to read the second. Salatin is a good author and both books were a fairly easy read. About the only negative, about 20% of each of these two books are identical, the same stories, etc. But they were good stories!SALAD BAR BEEF shows you how Joel raises beef in a sustainable and profitable manner. It could be replicated fairly easily for someone with access to land, own or rent. I admire Joel's leadership in this enterprise, his love of learning and teaching alike shows through in his ideals.Joel may not have convinced me to build mobile egg-huts, purchase pigerators, and hang rabbit cages from the ceiling, but he has inspired me to respect the circle of life, and be one of the few that keeps it circling."
2,Grimm,"I did not like this movie at all. To grimm, dark, silly and could not keep my intrest! I love Master Piece movies & A&E. This was just plain silly for me."
5,Work Great,"Finally got a chance to use these things and they are awesome. Easy to put on and held up great with two long boards on the highway!THe instructions on the storage bag are pretty much useless, mine were poorly printed so I could barely read or see the images. But It's not to hard to figure it out.I have an antenna on the back middle of my roof and this worked fine. The boards just push the antenna down with no harm to my antenna."
2,"Contrived and rushed, stick with Identity Crisis","Identity Disc was produced by Marvel as DC was breaking out their best selling mini-series Identity Crisis. While DC's mini proved to be a surprisingly superb read, Identity Disc comes off as what it is: a rushed and lame Identity Crisis-esque story that promises much and goes nowhere. Robert Rodi, who recently scripted the Loki and Tomb of Dracula relaunch mini's for Marvel, starts off nice with the gathering of Sabretooth, Juggernaut, Bullseye, Deadpool, Sandman, and Vulture as they are recruited to obtain a disc supposedly containing the identities of every super hero in the Marvel universe. The dialogue comes off as cheesy, while the big ""twists"" aren't really that big at all. The art by John Higgins is solid, but it's not enough to save Identity Disc from being as contrived as it is. All in all, fanboys may want to give this a look, but you're better off with Identity Crisis, or even Rodi's other work."
4,Kindle trouble,"This is another amazing book by Professor Crystal. Here I have found the answers to many questions that have arisen in my mind while studying English -yes, I confess myself a wordoholic- There is one problem with the Kindle version: the pages are not numbered; which would be insignificant in itself, were it not because of the reference to a certain page in a previous one, which should contain an answer to a question. Otherwise, the work is astounding."
4,"""Something Special""","Imagine the smoothness of silk and the richness of velvet in musical form. Perhaps, then you can begin to appreciate the quality, passion and soul of Russell Jeter's euphonious cd. This cd takes you on a journey of serenity, faith, and fulfillment. He feels every word and note and relegates those feelings to his listeners. This cd procures a resplendent future for this gifted young man. I suggest that Russell Jeter continue to reach for the moon because he can only alight among the stars."
5,Entertaining and romantic!,This story is wonderful! Once you turn the first page you are confronted with new and exciting ideas! Kid Calhoun isn't what you think! I've read this book at least 5 times! Each time I fall in love with the personalities created and love that the couples struggle to uncover! You'll enjoy the drama and the ending when its finally solved
4,Confident or Cocky?,"Steve balances his fantastic showmanship abilities with his natural gift of musical interpretation at just the right levels. It's a fine line between Cocky and Confident. Steve is 100% musician and 100% entertainer. Buy the cd, but make sure you catch this guy Live! You'll be glad you did!!"
4,"The Lemming Condition, a surpriseingly good book!!!","I read a book recently, The Lemming Condition. THe BOok was a story a young Lemming dealing with THE LEAP... You see his mind going from that of a child who's mind and thoughts is controled by his parents.... to that of an individual struggeling to knoe himself, who he is."
3,The Lemming Condition,"When I learned more about allegory and how it worked in the book, the book began to be more interesting. The author did a very good job on making the hidden meaning come out and really mean something. The book is fun to read and fun to try to think about and understand."
5,Best book for beginners I've seen.,Most of the others are far too abstract and spacey. This is a solid clear book with good code examples.
3,"Reasonably good primer (reasonably priced, too)","If you need a beginner's guide to Corba, this book may very well be the best one around. The book covers recent versions of Corba, which is good. However, you will soon find out that it is not in-depth enough for really serious application development. Also, there are some errors (minor I admit) in some of the IDL samples. As a result, some of the IDL samples and IDL constructions provided may not compile properly."
4,Very Nice Book,"This was a delightful book for my child, some larger words for 5 year olds, but with the help of Mom or Dad, children can read most words and understand the wonderful plot."
3,"Good, interesting","It does cause relaxation, I don't know about driving while taking. The results are questionable. But I would not say its the future for add, but it seems to help with anxiety."
2,"Ehhh, don't know why it works for everyone else!",Doesn't really work at all. I may start taking more than 2 a day to see if upping the dosage does something.
2,Dragons? More like Squirrels.,"I read the book aloud to my 8 year old who seemed to enjoy it despite the fact that it had almost nothing to do with dragons. I agree with other reviewers who describe the college student in the book as immature and very unbelievable and the young girl as whiny and demanding. My 8 year old enjoyed the squirrel aspect of the book but I can't imagine anyone over the age of 10 thinking this book is of any interest. Will read the next in the series to my son because he is hoping that eventually the dragons will play a role and actually come to life. Get at the library if interested, do not waste your money buying it."
2,A yawn,"I picked up this book with its attractive cover expecting an intriguing fantasy about dragons. The jacket flap assured me that this was a story about a fellow who moves into a mysterious house full of dragon figurines that come to life. Great, I thought, should be fun. But inside I found a long, slow, tedious grind of a read about a geeky british room renter, a put-upon landlady, a whiny little girl obsessed with squirrels, and a nasty neighbor. Much more than half the book goes by before there are any dragons worth mentioning; they certainly take their sweet time coming to life. Instead we mostly get endless silly exploits about trying to rescue a squirrel with one eye from being trapped by a suburban neighbor. I'm still not sure why the reader is supposed to care. Heck with the squirrels, let's have the dragons. The writing seems flat and contrived, and the whole thing lacked much magic or fun until waaaay towards the end."
4,The Fire Within Book Report,"This book has a main character named David, he is a 20 years oldcollege student and he live in a house with his mom and dad. This book isa fantasy book so it take place in a fantasy world. David became a tenantin a strange house filled with clay dragons and it was owned by Liz andLucy. David then receives a special dragon of his own named Gadzooks.Gadzooks helps David write a book. He received this dragon from Sophieand Lucy and Liz since they became best friend when they met in the claydragons house. They said that the clay dragon which is Gadzooks containsa enourmous fire power within him but David need to know how to unleashit so David could have magical fire When his dragon is sad and his dragonis in danger of dying, David must master the fire within, not only withhis hands, but with his heart power. The next sequel of the book continueanother called Icefire."
1,"This book doesn't make sense,and i don't like it.","This story wasn't entertaining,it didn't make me feel sad when characters die,i was just wishing it would finally be over,and through the entire book i was wondering why David was doing all these things just for one little squirrel in the garden instead of going to college. (So I'm just suggesting you probably DO NOT want to waste your $7.99 on this.)"
4,Great detail BUT lots of work!,"This item is FANTASTIC with regard to detailing, all the way to the ""GOTT MIT UNS"" (God is with us), on the belt buckle to the ""rounds"" in the snail drums and carriers. 21st Century has spared NOTHING on superb detailing! Only problem for me with my 58 yr old + fingers was getting the intricate belt and Y-strap items affixed thereto. If you are still young and super flexible, there should be no problem, except perhaps due to the pics being somewhat vague as to proper item placement, you may not be able to affix all the neat items properly. All in all, a FANTASTIC MG-34 machinegunner!"
1,Would not buy this again,"I bought this at the same time as a plug in car warmer. I used this exactly twice. Well, actually only once, because the second time when I went to use it, it was already activated and therefore useless. It's bulky and doesn't make good contact with the bottle, so the heat transfer is poor. I found it to only be useful to keep a warm bottle warm, and not to actually warm a cold one up. Boiling it to reset it is a pain. Not worth the money."
3,it's good on the go,i like the bottle warmer but when i try using it after few use. the water inside the pouch froze by it self. i hope i can returne the item.
5,I LOVE this book!,"I loved it as a child and now, six months pregnant with my first baby I have rediscovered it, much to the amusement of my husband! The pictures are just great and the story is so sweet. Really one of the GOOD children's books."
1,GIVE ME A BETTER ROLE MODEL!,"It is totally beyond my comprehension how or why ANYONE could want this woman as a source of spiritual enlightment, information, or admiration after reading this book! I was so totally disgusted, shocked and angry. Her justification of guns and giving hate back at unkind people made my mouth fly open! Where is LOVE? Where is compassion? Where is insight? AND, where is ""what goes around comes around"". I think Mary Summer Rain is a disgrace as any kind of teacher or role model in any type of spiritual capacity. She, and her entire family, came off as angry, bitter, mean spirited lowlife's to me."
5,Classic book,"Covers them all, with a little heavier on the Navy side. Getting dated, but gives excellent history of the early days."
1,Wrong item sent twice...terrible,I was sent the wrong item twice...not the one in the picture but a similar plastic piece of junk. Amazon could not get it right even with the proper item number.
2,"Too Much Philosophy, Too Little Information.","If you are looking for a book with helpful start-up information for 2005 this is not the book. The Author rambles about his distrust of Government and how it can be fun to live cheaply, but when the Author does reference an agricultural term, he fails to define it for the layperson. He had the right location and the right spouse at the right time and it worked for him. Obviously the Author has a side line to supplement his farming. If you are looking for reference material such as: What size tractor should I start with or what is a windrow? Then this is not the book for you."
5,Great Book!,I am a 3rd grade teacher and this book is great for a quick lesson on getting along with others and the importance of being different and accepting one anothers differences. My class loved it!!
5,Expand your collection!,"I should start out by saying there are two models of this soldier. One with a normal hat and one with a small hat. The white hat I received in package was way too small, much like on the picture of this soldier. However, all one must do if you have a small hat is write the company to receive a new regular sized hat. It is well worth it.The officer's hat is what makes this guy so appealing. The pipe is difficult to have stay in place but still provides atmosphere in his hand or carried on his belt. His gun is a first for this line. His holster actually opens and closes to hold his walther pistol. The map case adds another new item to your collection. A good buy!"
1,Horrible version,"I couldn't be in more agreement with the previous reviewer. This is an incredibly horrible version of Flash. Not only does it crash incessantly, but it makes everything unstable. You can't even use it together with Dreamweaver, becuase one of your programs will disappear. That's right, they just disappear and you lose all your work. No beep, no warning - nothing. I can't believe this was actually released this horribly and so rushed to market. They released updaters, but they don't really fix the problems. Hell, I can't even run some of my other software at the same time (won't even start, let alone the Dreamweaver thing). I don't know what's wrong, but between all of that and activation, the suite in general (including Flash) is just a mess."
1,Crash & burn part deux,What more is there to say... I keep losing work! It crashes an average of 2-3 times per day.I have the 7.2 update for my Mac OS X.3... it doesn't seem to help any.
3,not sure yet.,"Well, I have only been using flash for about 2 years, but I thought I had a pretty decent knowledge base, Though I find Flash MX professional very confusing compared to just Flash MX 2004..... with regard to actions and interactivity even, it seems like the help menu and tutorials i have been able to find only apply to Flash 2004. So!. I guess you really do have to be a professional!. ha. but. it has worked ok for me so far, no crashes or anything, I still think Im gonna go back to MX 2004 for my next job."
5,Divine,This chocolate is divine. The alpenmilch cream filling is heaven. I ate them frequently in Europe and now I can't find this kind with the cream filling in America. It's so smooth and sweet. You might not want to eat the whole bar in one sitting though; it gets a little too sweet towards the end. (I like to keep one in my desk drawer and eat a row every few hours on crazy stressful days. It makes the day better!)
2,Poorly written,"I am very disappointed in this book. After reading only the first couple of chapters, the poor editing and grade school sentence structure becomes exceptionally annoying. By the time the author has described the ""branches"" or ""denominations"" of Heathenry, they sound so unpleasant as to actually turn one off to the faith altogether. This, coupled with the rambling tone lead me to feel that this book has no direction and is mostly opinion, disguised as authority. If the author actually lives up to their assertion that they are in fact ""clergy"", one would assume they could at least write a decent sentence. If you are new to the subject, go google the topic. You'll learn more and the writing is better."
3,Beginner's Guide to Heathenry,"I was looking more for an impartial study of the ancient practices of the Northern Europeans, and so was mildly disappointed to discover that it was in fact a beginner's guide to modern Heathenry. However, the book still contains a good deal of invaluble information, just ordered in a mannor I was not expecting."
4,Frog percussion,"The description of the item stated that this sounds like a croaking frog. I followed the instructions, and played around with it, but it does take a little imagination and a little bit of a stretch to say it sounds just like a croaking frog. I gave it to a friend as a gift who loves frogs and drums, and she really liked it. However, it strikes me as something that the novelty wears off fairly quickly, as there really doesn't seem to be too much you can do with it. It may be played with on occasion and spend the rest of the time forgotten on the shelf. The picture is accurate, it is a wooden frog and baton, and comes in a strange hexagonal paper box which is open on the top. The frog is ""played"" by running the baton along the spine of the frog. The spine is ridged with triangular (or pyramidal) ridges. The baton is stored in the frog's mouth. There are several sizes of this available and I expect they will be similar, but with different tenors."
1,Disappointed!!!,"I was looking for a crochet book for scarves and I though finally, something nice, Plus Candi Jenson has the Crochet for tots book which I have which has some really cute things for babes/tots. This book as you go through the photos which are colourful, it seems almost like the same stitch different yarn and nothing to keep your eye lingering over either. No soft looking photos or that yummy yarn that make you want to run out and buy. ONly 1 scarf that half decent but not enough to motivate me to buy, If you are an avid corcheter and looking for something nice..[sadly shake head, this is not the book!!}"
3,CLASSIC GAMEPLAY GET'S IT DONE!,"I WOULDN'T SAY FIGHTING GAME OF THE YEAR BUT 100% BETTER THAN CAPCOM'S FIGHTING EVOLUTION. NOWHERE NEAR BETTER THAN CAPCOM VS SNK 2 BECAUSE SNK GRAPHICS ARE CRAPPY,NOT INNOVATIVE, AND LOOK THE SAME EVERY FIGHTING GAME. THE GAME HAS SOME OPTIONS AND CHARACTERS THAT MAKES IT WORTH RENTING AND MAYBE BUYING BUT I ADMIT,SNK ALWAYS HAD MORE FIGHTING GAMES AND INNOVATIVE CHARACTERS BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE GOT THE POTETIAL ON BEING BETTER!"
5,Very satisfied,Product arrived promptly and condition was as described. I would buy from this seller again.
2,Overly simple,"This is the first translation of The Book of Five Rings that I read. I wasn't terribly impressed with it. After reading the translation by William Scott Wilson, I am even less impressed with Kaufman's translation. While Wilson's may be a bit harder to comprehend on the first read, much is lost in Kaufman's translation in terms of language and metaphor. Kaufman's translation may be better for someone looking for a more simple explanation of technique. However, Wilson's translation offers much more for a reader to wrap his/her mind around. Since I have never read the original text, I can in no way claim to know whose translation is is closer to the original. However for those looking for a more cerebral experience, I would suggest Wilson's translation."
4,Read it more than once,"I recommend that readers reread the book couple of times for writing to show true nature of things to you. While the writing is on the art of sword fighting, principles laid out in the book can be applied in war, business and craftsmanship in a Zen like ways. Especially, if you are a student of martial arts, you may pickup one or two things on what it takes to win the fights."
5,GREAT DVD FOR THE CAR,THIS IS A FAVORITE AT MY HOUSE. WE WATCH IT ALL THE TIME. IT'S A GREAT DVD FOR THE CAR.
3,Great Price and Quick Delivery,"These brushes were among the most inexpensive brushes I found on the web and they arrived within a week without issue. I haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but they appear to be very well made."
4,Price is right,Nice to have a set of these around the house if you plan on doing any finishing. They are cheap enough you can use em and toss em! No clean up!
2,Poor Graphics,"I wish I could have seen the graphics before purchasing. The colors are so pale that I can barely see the jewels. As a result, I rarely play the game."
1,Get off the can and release the rest of the series already,"Why are the powers that be doing this to the NYPD Blue fans? I was never a fan of Friends or Will and Grace and already the entire series are all out on DVD.This is unbelievable . Enough already , get off your butts and release the rest of the series. At this point , I will be an old woman before season 12 comes out.GRRRRRR."
5,"NYPD Blue, all seasons are LOOOOOOONG overdue!!!!!","I followed this wonderful crime drama faithfully while on prime time, and bought the first few seasons on DVD as they trickled out. I have never seen a critically aclaimed show like this be so slow to get to DVD???? It just doesn't make any sence, do they just not want to? That is my take at this point, at the rate they are releasing this series the average viewing adult won't have a long enough lifespan to buy all of the seasons. If someone can clue me in than please do so."
5,"Well written, well acted, still riveting",Enjoying going back through it. Still find Andy's character to be the most poignant. Watching him go through this season's personal challenge was great.
5,Please in my lifetime,PLEASE release the rest of the series.I am 78 and would dearly love them to copme out in my lifetime.This is the very best of any Ploice series ever done.The charactors are all so well defined and each story is agem by itselfIt is very rare for any eposode to be anything but satisfying.THE ONLY FAULT with NYPD BLUE is it is put out by probably the least customer caring company in existance.I feel sorry for the short financial stae that does not allow thm to employ a PR.to know oublic reaction or do thei no longer carePRINCE RAFAEK
2,Good book spoiled by bad editing,"More precisely, the complete absence of editing. The problem is that the author may be a good scientist, and a first-hand witness to much of what he records, but he is not a good writer. I struggled through about a third of the book and then gave up. It's like reading something by a precocious 10-year-old -- just too awkward. An editor should have set him down and said, ""Look, here's how it's gonna be."" And then gone to work, ruthlessly. This is a first draft."
2,"Worked well, then broke",I don't know how it happened but somehow the wires that connect the probe to the read out came loose. I used it for awhile and it was sufficient. This time around I'm paying the extra $5 for the Weber. . .
2,NOT INSTANT READING,"THIS THERMOMETER TAKES ABOUT 12 SECONDS TO STABILIZE TEMPERATURE. THATS NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL ""INSTANT READING."" IT IS WELL-MADE. IT NEEDS TO BE SUBMERGED 2-3"" FOR A READING."
5,The Best Homemaking Book I've Read,"I read this book many years ago. It summed up a beautiful philosophy of homemaking, one that needs to be heard in our day. I had been scoffed at for my choice of staying home with my children, but no one scoffs anymore. Now, after years of following my heart, I have four great children and a beautiful home. I started simply, with ideas including Mrs. Schaeffer's ideas, and the Lord has blessed our family. This book is a must-read for every woman who needs to get a vision of what her home could be. It was wonderfully pleasant to find a kindred spirit in Mrs. Schaeffer...to find someone who agreed that the beautiful things in this world are God-sent and should be echoed in our homes."
2,Boring read,"I think the idea or basis behind the book is very good. However, this book bored me from page one. It was also very repeticious; the author doesn't quite give recommendations on how to create this art in your home but instead goes in circles saying that we are all creators and can create art. I was looking for actual ideas on how to incorporate art into my home and this book definitely did not come through. Her descriptions were also very hard to follow and I'm not sure if she's from England or just an old hippie type. Or maybe both...but her words were hard to put into ideas."
2,A Lost Cause,"Weak attempt at a hip vampire/cult novel. Watch a Buffy rerun or read a Rice novel, and skip this underdeveloped mess."
4,Excellent book,"The book lost souls was an interesting story. I think it still would have been and excellent book regardless of the vampires, but it was still an incredible read. Brite captured the feel of the goth subculture to an incredible extent. The story line was also incredible until the last quarter of the book. It slowly became to esoteric and difficult to be interested. The introduction of several new characters put the main story into a subplot and made the book some what boring towards the end. Even so, it is not to disuade a person to pick up the book and read it."
4,"Lush, Hip and Sexy","This is one of my favorite vampire stories, although it's not for the prudish. EXCELLENT prose. Antiformulaic, with no castle, no faultless ingenues... just beautiful [androgynous] boys, lost girls, Southern charm and supernatural entities that will both scare and intrigue you. Lots of interesting male/male relationships, sexual and otherwise. Definitely a worthwhile read."
1,disappointing,"After reading all the above reviews, I was expecting a lot more. I found it tedious, overwritten, not at all scary, and lacking in narrative drive. Stick with King."
5,Excellent,An excellent and up to date review of the whole field of rheumatology. This book is very thorough and is well organized so as to enable easy access to the information contained therein.
2,Not the best Pat Hutchins.,"This is okay.I liked ""Rosie's Walk"" and ""Good-night, Owl"" because of the wonderful art, the concepts (over, under, around) and the substantive content (ornithological names of different birds).This book has great art, but doesn't offer anything intellectually and can't keep my boy's attention.This is one to check out from the library before you buy."
4,"funny, fascinating, disorganized","This is a very funny book, with lots of fascinating anecdotes from an unusual social environment.Its main drawback is that that's all it is: a grab-bag of anecdotes that jumps around randomly in time, place, and topic with no discernible logic."
2,Dissapointing book,This book is messy and chaotic.The language used is cynical. I tried to read it through but I gave up after several pages. I do not recommend it.
4,Nueva novela meets Novela testimonial,"The style and form of Boquitas Pintadas makes the reader an interactive participant in the creation of this work. The Don Juan archtype is a classical touch to a new and innovative writing style that mixes, jounalism, diary, ficcional prose, and correspondance. If you like the detective stories where you try to figure out the ending before you get to it, you will like this work."
2,So so phone,"Battery life on this phone is short, it keeps dying. If you talk for more than 4 hours, forget about it.The answering machine is okay, but getting it to work properly is a real chore.Speakphone is a nice feature. Works well easy to use.The fax is cumbersome.I would not buy another one. I'm dumping mine and getting a Sony."
2,not a guide book,"this is a truly ecclectic book, disorganized at best. it covers lots of topics, but by subject matter. it's worthless as a tour guide unless you want to read the whole book and bookmark the pages that are in the geographic locale you plan to visit. there is a state index in the back, but it's worthless too. i was quite disappointed. use the web site to plan your journey - it's *much* easier!"
5,A Great Book for The Tourist At Heart,"This book is well written, witty and sheds light on America's lesser known tourist attractions. I laughed constantly while reading it and was very happy to have purchased it. A very fun read to be sure..."
1,Dont waste your money,The hasp continually slips out as it isn't sized properly. It will not hold together and therefore the belt is worthless.I'm looking for a replacement.
2,You get what you pay for,"The belt is....adequate. The most disappointing part is that the D-ring part of the buckle itself, the part that has the same color as the webbing, is made of a very cheap plastic. I suppose it won't be noticeable to anyone else, but it feels cheap. It's hard to imagine that an ounce or two of aluminum or steel would have greatly increased the cost, but more importantly, I was disappointed that the description omitted this fact; I would have expected the price to be a couple of dollars lower if I had known."
3,"Men""s Belt Review",The beige colored elastic belt I received fits my basic needs for casualusage. The one item on the belt that needs improvement is the size of the open end of the belt as it slides through the buckle.It's too large and does not pull straight through the belt buckle. Otherwise it is fine. Also I would like to see an option to have the leather parts of the belt done in a brown leather finish as it provide a more finished look.
4,A step above most romance novels,This novel is a step above most romance novels which are usually heavy on the romance and light on the story. This is a well written story with characters who are fully fleshed out and just the perfect degree of romance thrown in.
3,Not that funny to modern listeners,"There are some amusing moments on this CD. ""Lima, Ohio"" deals with a lonely traveling salesman who meets a Jewish couple (it helps to understand yiddish to understand this one) and the bit about airplane glue brings a chuckle or two (Richard Pryor has credited this bit with being a major influence). ""The Defiant Ones"" (with Eric Miller) causes a few yuks with this gag on integration ""For a piano to play, you need both the Whiite keys and the dark-keys."" However, the dated references to Krushchev, Nixon, Orval Faubus, Sherman Adams, etc. will make this largely of historical interest."
5,Imagination.com,I loved the book my Aunt bought it for me. It was fun to read and I am going to read it to my little sister.
1,Nail Softener Ineffective,I have tried just about all the nail softeners on the market & Med Nail Softener by Gehwol is the worst by far. It also is the most expensive. I would never recommend this product & because of feeling I was taken in by false advertising - I would never buy any product marketed by Gehwol. Believe me - any hand or facial cream would have more of a curative effect than this product.
4,The Itch,"This book is entertaining. This is a book that keeps you wanting to know what is next. After reading Good Hair, I ran out and bought The Itch. I hope Benilde's next book is as good as Good Hair and The Itch. I would recommend this book to others, but I would hope they read Good Hair first. The characters in this book were very interesting. I was happy to see Sherry and Miles in the book, it was like the continuation of Good Hair. All in all I did like this book and would read more from Benilde Little."
3,It Was Okay,"I read both ""Good Hair"" which still left me wanting more and ""The Itch"". In both of these books the character Miles Browning is mentioned so I hope there is going to be another book written on his development. As for Natasha, she handled that situation with class. I would like to read more on what happened afterwards with her. As for Abra I was glad to see that she had grown from her relationship with Cullen and was able to move on. As for Cullen, I didn't like this character one bit because even though he moved on (with a mutual friend of theirs Jackie) and he stated more than once that he made the right decision in leaving Abra, he still felt slighted because he thought that Abra should be somewhere in a corner pining away for him! All in all I look forward to seeing what else Benilde Little has in store fo us"
3,"Made me depressed, but it was ok.","I read this book pretty quickly...I guess that means that there was not much depth. But that is not always the case. I really just wanted to finish a book that depressed me. As a single black female I am already depressed at the fact that the pickings are slim. This book (although fiction) confirms that. I do know that the good men are out there. Overall the book was ok...it kept my interest for a day and half.I'll wait on her next one and hopefully the characters will be more interesting, NEXT..."
4,Part I was excellent. Part II was mediocre.,"I LOVED Good Hair and could not wait to sink my teeth into The Itch. Part I was a page turner, I could not put the book down. Part II however, was disappointing. Although I was told in a paragraph at the end of the story that Abra had identified her itch, I did not see this in the story. Yes, I know she went to counseling and moved to Los Angeles but I did not see how Abra developed. We know she lost weight, cut her hair, started dating again but I really didn't see any self growth. Instead, the novel spent more time on Miles and Natasha's relationship. I wanted to hear more about Sherry Steptoe and Abra. I realize that writing about self actualization is extremely difficult so spending more time on Miles and Natasha was the ""easy way out"". I loved Ms. Little's novels and I look forward to her next book."
3,TYPICAL!,"I enjoyed this book as an easy read, and it was like reading a tabloid. It was ashame that it involved infidelity and lack of commitment with black people. When are we going to have an author put our successful black professionals into a good light. I can understand that if they do that, the book would probably be boring, but that is what creativity will do, make us want to read more about successful people that reflect ourselves instead reflecting all of society. It was entertaining."
5,A silent storm that takes you there!,I really enjoyed this book. My book club read Good Hair and felt it was lukewarm but this was a fascinating story. I felt that the characters were well developed and sister did her homework. The sex scenes were so hot you felt like you were there. I enjoy a story where the characters grow. I think that everyone in the book learned something about themselves. I commend Benilde on this profound read. Her finger is on the pulse on the black upper crust. I am now a fan for life!! I'm fellin you sista!
5,Amazing results,"This is a great product. I have suffered with acne scars forever. I have tried getting rid of them naturally with shea butter, honey and other crazy home concotions but they weren't working very well. I have even used Clinique's Even Better skin corrector (expensive) and I have not had the results that I have had with this product. This product does work. I wear mac foundation and now that I have used this product for a month I don't even have to wear make up anymore and this was what I have been striving for. I am thrilled!! I put it on at night and even during the day but I make sure to put on a sunscreen everyday. I use the Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer with spf 30 and my skin glows. I also do coffee scrubs and regular steam facials at home and my skin is smooth and soft. Try it...you will be amazed. But don't expect results over night. Just stick with it."
2,Sleeve too hot,The sleeve fit pretty good though the power cord had to be bent to fit inside the back area. Unfortunately I must take the laptop out of the sleeve to use it as the computer gets too hot and shuts off. The fan is on the bottom of the laptop and the neoprene doesn't allow air to circulate. I would not purchase this item again.
5,Excellent and Moving,Straightforward songs with genuine feeling are a refreshing change from the more cynical music that is so common now. Waxwings is a nice reminder from a generous and gifted artist.
3,good so far,"I am not a great baker. Bread is usually too dry or soggy. I have a very variable oven so that doesn't help. Stone arrived in good condition. It was triple boxed and had a bunch of those foam peanuts, I don't think it could have cracked. Packaging good for the product not so good for the environment.The instructions call for 30 minutes at 500F before reducing to your baking temp. Did that and then placed 2 small loafs on the stone, reduced the temp and waited. The outcome 2 quite tasty loaves. Nice and crusty on the outside and not too dry inside. I placed a water filled baking tray on the bottom shelf and thats seemed to work ok.Stone was easy to clean with water, not sure how it will clean with pizza sauce on it.The instructions say store the stone in the oven, not sure about that, may store it in bubblewrap in a cabinet."
1,Arrived in pieces,"Arrived in pieces. The stone is packed in a plain cardboard box. No styrofoam, bubble wrap, nothing. I'm surprised anyone receives it in one piece. It was included in a larger order than had paper packing inside the larger box, but obviously not enough to get the stone intact."
4,Bostonian Prescott,"Had this same shoe and wanted to replace it. The shoe is slightly longer in the toe area, but fits fine."
3,"Bostonian Men's Prescott Slip-on, Black, 11 D",Lightweight and flexible. Cannot attest to overall comfort or durability. Returned due to fit. Ran a bit narrow and short in comparison to other brands in the size 11D.
4,Nice and easy,Very easy to use. Stitches look consistent and even. Stitches are undetectable from the face of the fabric? I would recommend this to a friend
4,Seems to be working,"I purchased these for my son's dresser. They were easy to install, and seem to work. I tried to pull the dresser over and could not. I'm satisfied that if I can't pull the dresser over, neither can my 3 year old. I can't comment on the long term performance of this product since I've only had it a few months, but I don't see any reason why it would degrade over time. I will test it periodically though to make sure it continues to secure the furniture."
1,Think twice,"Just a warning to other parents. We purchased this item and found it to be very unsafe. There is no way to lock the strap. Once it is tightened in place, all that is needed to untighten it is to pull on it, meaning the furniture could easily still topple over. Also, the sewn end of the strap pulled apart and came off from the bracket during its first use. I'm just glad this didn't happen after we had installed it. I would highly recommend looking for another product."
4,I'm happy I bought this book,"This is a book written by a very innovative and competent quilter in the 80's. I'm a very experienced strip quilter, using rotary methods, and I still found new ideas. The 'cut and combine to make new patterns ' are really stunning, and very well explained and easy.It's easy enough for a new quilter, and has neat ideas for an experienced one ."
5,Light Bulb,I've used this product for close to ten years on average 3 hours per day and it was only recently gave way. Not a very easy product to find. This was the best price on the market by far and the delivery was very prompt. Great shopping experience.
2,"Even if you get the CD, the software is WAAAAY outdated","Even though the above only is the booklet that goes to the CD program, I bought the CD program from my college bookstore and the software, being dated back to 1998, wouldn't even run on any of my home computers (win 98, and win xp). Even when I tried running it in win 95 compatibility mode on xp (software recomends win 95), the program crashed every 5 minutes. Unless the CD gets updated, it is a peice of junk."
2,don't do it.,When I bought this I didn't know it was a re-recording of old songs. I thought it was the old recordings remastered. I just don't like his new arrangements.
2,Islam through rose colored glasses,"karen Armstrong is probably a nice person. Or, at all events, she is probably a nice person to know since she is the kind of person who looks at the world a s sees it as it ought to be. Certainly Islam ought to be a religion that respects women, treats the poor with kindness, and tolerates difference. English-speaking readers, however, come to a one-volume history of Islam to discover why it is that so many Muslims live under backward, corrupt regimes, opress women, keep slaves, and believe that murdering Americans is justified by their religion. After reading about Ms. Armstrong's kind and gentle Islam, you will be as unenlightened as you were before you opened the book. Bernard Lewis, Islam in History, is a far superior one volume introduction to the rich and complex world of Islam."
4,"A VERY short history indeed, but a great starting point.","The history is brief and breakneck, but it has an excellent bibliography and helpful appendices. It's also nicely written and easy to read. It's not quite true, as some other reviewers have suggested, that she omits any discussion of fundamentalism or the position of women. The discussions are extremely brief, but then again, in such a short book, with 1400 years and a few empires to cover, I didn't feel this was unfair.Use it for a broad introduction and further reading guide."
1,Airbrushed Islam,"Karen Armstrong airbrushes all the moles, pimples, and warts of the face of Islam in this book. If you want the politically correct version of the history of Islam, this is the book for you. It is loaded with half-truths, factual errors, excuses for bad behavior, and euphemisms that are the basis for her opinion on Islam. For example: A common theme throughout the book is ""the Christians did it too"". When is bad behavior to be excused when ""others do it as well""?"
4,A good introduction to a wider topic,"Armstrong's book is nothing more and nothing less than what it claims to be in the title; that is a short history. She moves through each significant generation, dynasty or movement in Islamic history from the beginning in the early 600's to the present day. For those looking for an informative read on Islamic history, you wont find it here. Each chapter or section is a basic overview of each dynasty, its politics, wars and interpretation of Islam. However, one aspect of this book which was highly informative and enlightening were the last chapters on the clash of western colonialism with Islam from the late 18th century and the effect this had on the psyche of muslims and their understanding of Islam. It is rather tragic that to this day, muslims around the world still lack a true understanding of Islam."
4,Well written History,It is a well written history. The author defines some Arabic terms a uses them like you could remember all of them. On Kindle it needs an Arabic dictionary to help.
3,Meh ...,"This is a decent book for anyone seeking an overall picture of Islamic history. I have one problem with the book, however: The author doesn't cite any external sources within the text to justify the history. While I am sure that everything she says is correct, proper citations would have given me a sense of academic rigor. In the back of the book, she does have a list of suggested readings. I suppose that is where she gathered her information."
1,whitewashing & falsifying Islam's violence is dangerous,"Armstrong has gotten a lot of free publicity from NPR and other media who like her politically correct, pro-Palestinian politics. She has been on a crusade to prove that Islam is a religion of peace, while even the most basic familiarity with the Koran and with the history of Islam is that it is a religion that divides the world into the House of Peace (those countries ruled under Islam) & the House of War (all other countries in the world - fair game for conquest). This is the opposite of the honest, truthful education we need."
2,A short history,"Politics & religion aside, I've been reading history for over 30 years and found this book incredibly hard to follow. Perhaps if I had a rudimentary knowledge of Islam it would have been easier but I can't say this book is a good choice as a first book on Islam."
5,very informative,"I have read this book and was very pleased with my purchased. I think that this book is a very good book to read and follow on the history of not just black people but all people, absolutely 5 stars."
5,"""A SINGLE STAR"" IS BETTER THAN CLANCY",What a great read! This novel has a gripping and suspenseful plot that realistically addresses terrorist and nuclear threats. And it is very well-written - -Barnett has quite an ear for dialogue! This definitely is the best book I've read in years. I can't wait for his next novel.
4,Style and Substance,"Rich's collection of essays on poetry, WHAT IS FOUND THERE, is a superb tapestry of provocative, incisive, and relevant ruminations on poetry. What I really liked about this book is Rich's ability to connect poetry to one's everyday life, not describing it as something to be read by an elite, educated few.() Still, this book moved me and, as a student of poetry, I am inspired and hopeful that poetry and the discussion of it still thrives, contrary to many predictions."
2,Competent but uninspired,"This is competent work, but that's about it. Readers interested in Section 31 should be warned that the book doesn't really delve into the workings of that mysterious organization. The operative who is trying to kill Seven of Nine is already dead, which takes away a lot of the potential drama of the situation.This is the sort of book you can breeze through on a bus or in a waiting room without missing anything. And by the way, the previous reviewer was wrong in calling this Section 31 series the big summer Trek crossover. There's a 7-book crossover called ""Gateways"" in the pipeline."
4,Oscillating motor broke after 3 months,"Like most people who have written a review here, I like this air purifier. It cuts down on the amount of dust floating around and I've notice that I have less congestion than I did before it. Also, like most who have written a review, the oscillating motor on my air purifier crapped out within a few months using it basically 24/7 (as the instructions recommend). I'm not sure how much that affects its ability to clean the air, but that probably puts it at a 3-4 star product when it could have been a 4-5.I bought this over other varieties because I hate buying filters and I didn't want my air UV treated because I believe its healthy for your immune system to breathe in some living bacteria/viruses rather than living as a bubble boy. If you have an autoimmune disease, YMMV. Given that, since I've had this product, I haven't bought a filter and I have had a cold, I consider this product to be a great success."
3,Minimal Difference in Air Quality,"I want to point out two things in this review: The quality I have observed, and some basic maintenance observations.I use this purifier in a work environment that has fairly high air quality, but I was still surprised that after 3 months of use, very little dust had accumulated in the filter. There was some large particulate on the foam filter, and only the tiniest layer of dust in the HEPA-style filters. Perhaps if I worked in a coal mine I would feel like I was getting my money's worth out of this thing. As it is, I feel duped.Also, I want to point out that both the foam filter and the electric filters can and should be washed with water, and that the machine does not automatically detect a cleaned filter. After cleaning, you need to manually reset the ""reset filter"" light by using a pen to depress the small button next to the light. (This info is presumably all in the manual, but this may be helpful for review-reliant manual discarders like myself.)"
4,Pretty good,"I bought this to hopefully help with all the dust in my smaller house. Judging by the dust it collects, it does indeed work well. I usually leave it on the lowest setting so the noise it makes is not an issue at all for me. I enjoy having the noise at night anyway. Cranked up on the highest setting will be louder, but you should know that already. My only fault with it is that when it rotates it screeches like someone scraping their nails on a chalkboard. Therefore, I never leave it in rotate mode. Cleaning the filters is easy and you just have to let them dry before using again. Overall a good product."
4,VERY SATISFIED,"A very efficient purifer, or bedroom has a different feel as soon as you walk in the door, and our breathing has become noticably easier. Cleaning the filtersis a breese. Would recommend to anyone that has anykind of breathing problems.Item purchased--Honeywell HFD 120 Tower HEPAQuiet Air Purifer with Permanent IFDfilter. color blackpurifer"
5,pricey,Bestbuy store putting on the Price cost $99 in my town.on the website Amazon posting Price $139 ..checking out and reducing price
2,Nice for a short while,"Nice fan when it works. Oscillating motor broke in 7 months, and fan was only in use 3-4 of those 7 months. Fan was always clear of objects and always handled with care."
3,Not Quite as Advertised,"There's a smoker in my house. I've had this unit about a week and have it on full speed all day until bedtime. It does take the lingering smoke out of the air (no more cloud) but it does not get rid of the smell. I turn it down to low overnight and in the morning I can still smell stale smoke. Getting rid of smoke, yes. Purifying the air, no."
5,Breathe easier and feel better,"I bought this 6 months ago and run it 24/7 and the amount of dust and dirt I clean out of the filter ever 2 months is amazing. When I bought this I had a cough when I would lay down to go to bed and would cough through the night and wake up my girlfriend. After 1 month of running this air purifier I haven't coughed since. I also have more energy when I'm at home and don't feel as lethargic or feel the need to open windows to get fresh air into the room. If this cost 300 dollars I would still recommend it to everyone I know. Great product, operates very quietly and easy to clean. If I could give it more stars I would."
5,Finally something that works!,"I bought the Suki Eye Tissue Repair in the hopes of finding a nourishing nighttime cream that wouldn't absorb quickly. Not only did I see an immediate difference on the delicate tissue around my eye, with noticably improved tone (goodbye crepe-like undereyes!), but it also helped the fine lines. When I look in the mirror, I feel 5 years younger. And, I now use it during the day too. You can't get too much of a good thing!"
2,Uneven at best... try other books first,"Okay so if you're gay and into horror or dark fantasy you will feel compelled to buy this book and read it. But I have to warn you it may be better to glance at a story or two at your local bookstore before laying out the cash (it's relatively expensive compared to other similar titles).Some stories are well done but the majority were simply either crude or not horrific. The worst I read was ""Hey Fairy"" which had a monstrous and distasteful wish-fulfillment ending and the supernatural element made no sense -- obviously the author was not at all familiar with faerie lore or he would know the fey folk don't possess people.So buy this at your own risk. The editor's work with gay vampire stories was far far superior."
2,It may be good if it wasnt so stale....,"This coffee looked like a good deal and had some good reviews but dont be deceived! I think this particular bag of coffee I got had to have sat in the warehouse for at least a year. The beans, when ground, go to dust instantly. When I added the hot water to it (I use a french press), the water became very foamy - I have never seen beans do this before with hot water added to this extent. (talking 4-5 inches of foam above the water)Finally, the coffee taste itself is old. Stale, old and if it hasnt been sitting in a warehouse for over a year then the company doesnt know how to cure it's own beans. Move on, as it's not a ""deal"" when you cant drink the stuff."
1,Boundless... yeah right.,"I love doing my nails and I'm REALLY good at it. I buy many different kinds of polish. I bought two of these CG Boundless nail polishes and attempted to do my nails. When I say attempted, I mean-- it was nearly impossible! This stuff was SO runny and went everywhere. It looked like a child painted my toenails (which are hard enough to do). I will never buy this product (or CG nail polish) again."
2,"2 good tracks, 1 throwaway","I would consider Ballad Of Cable Hogue to be among Calexico's better tracks, but if you already have the full-length album Hot Rail, the only reason to get this single is for the Crystal Frontier B-side, which is decent, but pretty similar to other Calexico songs. Hard Hat is just seven minutes of very quiet ambient desert sounds, making this a CD single for completists only.edit: get ""Even my Sure Things Fall Through"" Instead."
4,Good safe cutter,"I really like this cutter, it is so much safer than my 20 year old Olfa. I just wish someone would come out with a more ergonomic 28mm"
3,Interesting,"First off a disclaimer. I'm not an economist, college grad, or heavey weight intellectual. With that out of the way I want to say this is, like most of the Very Short Intro books, a good place to begin on a subject. It's a quick over view and pretty thorough given the built in limitation. My one observation is that the author mentions Keynes and Keynsian economics a couple times but not Milton Friedman or Hayek at all by name while he does deal quite a bit with Friedman's methods. I thought that was an interesting omission."
4,This is what I think farming should be.,"This is the first book which I received from a group of my fellow employees when they found out I was venturing into buying a farm that my family and I could run. What an Eye opener!! I could hardly put the book down-- and my wife also flew through it. The downside of the book is it's visual stimulation, the busy rhetoric that Joel sometimes uses and the lack of details that are offered for construction methods,( how to get started from scratch etc.. But , don't let these small points dissuade you from ordering this book... it's wonderful, imaginative and very ""catchy""... I look forward to more reading and following through on the ideas presented by Joel and his wonderful sounding family."
5,All Joels Books are Great!,"This is my 4th or 5th book by this author and they are all educational and amusing at the same time. He has a great, relaxed writing style that is easy to read and many of his stories are hilarious. The information given is very educational and just in-depth enough to cover the subject. I recommend any or all of Joel's books. I hope someday to get to hear him speak in person."
4,A World of Difference,"Although I still haven't mastered all of the functions, it has been amazingly helpful in my running. I've been trying to stay on a marathon training schedule which requires a certain amount of mileage each day. Before the Garmin I would have to go measure a route with my car and then run it (major pain in the rear!) It allows me to see my pace per mile so I can moderate so I do not get too overzealous and end up hitting the wall and hitchhiking home. I'm also able to look back at the history of my previous runs to track my progress. The only problem I've encountered so far is when I'm sure I've almost reached 10 miles and I look at the Garmin and I've only gone 3. I'm sure on those days it's just malfunctioning :)"
5,Perfect for what I need,"I bought this after hunting with my cousin. We all got somewhat turned around and lost at some point while she simply kept putting in markers on her wrist device and going where the garmin told her to. I bought mine for much the same purpose. I haven't put it through the full routine yet, but I have tested it out on hikes and walks with my wife. The mileage, pace, and settings seem incredibly accurate in my neck of the woods (Prescott, AZ), and seems to do well in the midst of boulders and trees. Very impressed and well worth the cost to know my way around when it counts. Only ""drawback"" seemed to be battery life- I would definitely recommend carrying spares. Have not used the running/training functions and really don't plan to, so I can't vouch for those."
2,Weak GPS reception makes this useless,"The first two times I used this device it worked relatively fine -- GPS signal dropped a couple of times, but I expected this to happen every once in a while. Ever since then, I get signal, at best, about 25% of the time. Cloudy, not cloudy. Tall buildings or a clearing -- the signal is always weak (and the batteries are good). I'm giving this device two stars because the concept is fantastic. Too bad the device is useless without signal. The stopwatch works well, but I can get one of those for $10 at Target. Perhaps my unit is defective. Either way, I'm returning it."
2,3 Replacements- So Far!!,"I bought my battery operated Forerunner in 2004. Since then, I have had the unit replaced a total of 3 times to date because each unit inexplicably stops working after weeks or months of use (I use it for running workouts only). I have not received a reason or response from the company as to why this happens. All the feedback you get is to return the malfunctioning unit for ""repairs."" Inevitably, they send you a brand new one. Of course the company does not cover your own cost to ship the unit each time. It's great technology that works well-when it works. Because of my experience with the unit I would not recommend it to anyone, nor will I purchase another from this company."
4,Good beginner gps for running,"I had my Garmin 101 for 3 years. I just upgraded to the 205. If you are looking for a good entry level gps and trainer for running, walking, etc. this is it. Enough bells and whistles to keep you going for a while. The only draw back is if you live more urban and get stuck in those ""concrete valleys"", this will loose contact with its satellites. But runnning for 3 years in Denver with it was great. I've moved to a more urban area and wanted a more robust receiver. If you need that, get the 205."
4,Would recommend,"Except for a few concerns with accuracy at times, really like the Garmin forerunner 101 wrist GPS. Easy to use, and great for different routes on runs."
1,Not accurate,The pace calculation is very inaccurate. I have been running for 15 years and know when I am maintaining a constant pace. According the Forerunner 101 my pace varies from 7:30-minute miles to 9:00-minute miles all within the same mile. This renders the virtual training partner feature useless. This is not much more than a very expensive sports watch. When I sent an e-mail to Garmin tech support about the problem. It took them almost four working days to answer and then only to tell me that that's as good as it gets.
5,Review by a Runner,"I've been running with this for about a month now in Kuwait. It's my new running buddy! It has many options for running/training. The only thing it can't do is hook up to your computer. However, it can store 2yrs worth of training. If you're a techy, then perhaps the 201 or 301 might be for you. But the 101 does pretty much everything they can do. Just for the record, it does not have a heart monitor, but who cares? Just RUN!"
4,Garmin Forerunner 101: Love It or Hate It.,"I'm loving it. Once you understand and accept the limitations of GPS you will be able to live with it's shortcomings. So far, I haven't had trouble with my unit with regards to functionality or signal reception in flat open NE Ohio. For an entry level device, considering it's light weight and small size, it is a little marvel. Ten years ago, much larger hand held units where massively more inaccurate than people accuse the Forerunner of having today. One nice feature about GPS units is that once the device has physically visited a particular location, it will be more precise when it visits that location again. The data the Forerunner produces is very helpful in maintaining pace and tracking distances, but the virtual partner is hidden gem of encouragement. Accurate or not, the Forerunner has gotten me out on the road again when I normally wouldn't bother."
3,Nice song choices from a superstar,"The songs are enjoyable, the accompaniment is wonderful. But some of the keys Crystal chose to sing these songs in reveal a bit of strain to her. Naturally all voices deepen as they age, but there should have been a bit more thought given to this area. I have been a pure Crystal Gayle fan since the beginning of her career, so it was a bit disheartening to hear some of the efforts which do not come as easily for her at this stage. Otherwise, the song choices are good ones."
4,"quick, so. cal ska-core","The Assorted Jelly beans play a kind of frantic style of ska-core without horns. This cd sounds sort of like a mix between OpIvy, Falling Sickness, and the Voodoo Glow-Skulls. The lyrics cover basic punk topics and add a little humor, but aren't really anything new. However, about 2/3 of the songs are actually pretty good, so if you like ska-core, it's a pretty good buy."
3,Ska-punk without horns,"The Assorted Jellybeans sound much like operation ivy,squad 5 0,and the earlier suicide machines.They are ska-punk lacking horns.They don't have the songwriting of operation ivy or the suicide machines,but much like squad 5 0 they have enough energy and catch songs to make it worth it.They should add a little diversity to their songs though."
3,great executive bag,This bag is huge and keeps me organized. The. Bag weighs allot. It is not for the person with a small frame. The bag looks elegant and well made. I was dissapointed that the material that covers the seem of the handles started to peel just after one day of use. I cut of the piece. I'm afraid the rest might come off after a while. I especially like all the inside and outside compartments. I give this bag 3 stars because of the weight and second because the glue like material that covers the seems of the handle partially came off.
4,"Incredible, probably overlooked","This book is incredibly interesting. It is all about the crusade for justice in a corrupt city. . .well, actually, a corrupt government. I started reading it and I just couldn't put it down! You will see politics and the world a lot differently after you read this.I rated the book only 4 stars because 1) you need to have a basic knowledge of Court Proceedings and pleadings to understand it, and 2) it has many annoying typographical errors, such as commas where there dont need to be commas, uncapitalized words, proper names which aren't capitalized, and things like that. Nonetheless, this book is a must have for anyone interested in the justice system, or just like reading about the corruption around us."
4,"Great Performance, Bad video transfer.",Great performances. But this transfer to dvd is very poorly. Unlike what the cover may suggest it's not enhanced for 16:9 widescreen televisions. But what's even more sad is that the video is full of digital artefacts. Especially in the beginning of act three the décor seems to have a life of it's own. It spoils a lot of your viewing pleasure.The sound is great.
2,"Awful acting by female ""stars""","Studer is great as long as she stands still and just sings. Her ""acting"" is humorous if nothing else. Lipovsek is painful to watch with those stupid facial expressions. Marton's voice is nearly intolerable and she looks perpetually annoyed while waddling around the stage like a penguin. Richard Hale is very good. Ditto Terfel.The videography is pointless. The sets are...well what sets are there in this opera beside the house? The casting of the extras must have been courtesy of the United Nations. The camera is fixated on Solti...no evidence the orchestra even exists. Sound is good.Typical uneven opera by R. Strauss. But made much worse by this overrated production."
5,an excellent source of info on ghengis khan,lister has taken an excellent angle by writing on the early life of ghengis. very quick and understandable reading on any level! a delight to read!
5,Buy it and follow the authors' advice. You'll be glad you did!,"I am a Graphic Designer who has been working freelance from home for going on three years now and I wish this book had been out when I started my business.My wife bought the book last month because she is thinking about starting a virtual assistant business. She left it in the ""library"" and I picked it up to skim through the pages. My skim turned into a cover-to-cover read and I learned more than I would have thought possible.The day after I finished reading I sat down to write a Strategic Marketing Plan according to the template in the book and about 10 days after that I was interviewed in the local paper (part of my plan) and got two jobs as a result.Buy it and follow the authors' advice. You'll be glad you did!"
5,A Well-Stocked Toolkit,"I found everything I needed and so much more than I expected in this book!Well-written, thorough information sewn together with threads of wisdom, experience and wit. Quite possibly the only business book I've ever read that reached my mind, my soul and my funny bone.I feel so well prepared to start my business in the new year!Thank you.Kelly"
3,"Great Fun CD, but not outstanding","I liked the Against Me! song on the Rock Against Bush CD enough that I wanted to hear more by them, so I picked up this CD. This band has some definate strengths, fusing folk and punk, although it may seem like a weird idea is actaully pretty clever and has a fun albeit somewhat goofy sound to it from time to time. The lyrics in all of these songs are outstanding. The shouting of the chorus in ""We Laugh At Danger"" alone makes me want to see these guys live as soon as possible. The band's main weakness however, lies in their vocals. A lot of out of tune screaming going on, I know its punk and this is standard but it just gets a little old and boring in some songs. This CD has some songs that really shine, but theres some bad ones on here too, and although I'd reccomend you buy it, it's pretty good, it might not be something you play all that often."
1,Their weakest album,The new Against Me! is more pop friendly than it used to be. But the very old Against Me! isn't that great either. This album is mostly acoustic guitars. Not a lot of rocking.
1,"If you like present day Tony Orlando, go to Branson, Mo.","This album is just another attempt to make more money by a performer who has not been on top for years.The music is weak, and the vocals are lacking.Even though the price was great,dig deeper and buy the originals.In my mind nothing compares to the original!"
2,Nearly Worthless,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I fail to see what the other reviewers found in this book. I feel that the author might have been aiming for something along the lines of the Elements of Style, but fell drastically short. You will find little help here if you have taken a research and writing class within the last three years. Pages five through 18 are spent explaining the difference between the executive and legislative branches. I am not sure who this book is aimed at, but it is far too basic for someone looking to add serious shine to their writing. There are too many other good books on the subject for me to recommend this title to anyone. Look elsewhere."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"It's not often that I write a negative review, but in this case, I had to be honest. I was very let down and disappointed with Robert Irvin's interpetation of Ancient Egypt! The music, if you can call it, that was a bunch of fragmented notes and noises that failed to capture the imagination of living in ancient Egytian times! The only reason I took a chance on this, was Robert's dinosaur soundscape CD that was excellent! If you are looking for more authentic Egyptian music, I would suggest you skip this and buy Echoes of Egypt by Diane Arkenston/David Arkenstone."
5,An Auditory Journey,"When I first heard ""Ambient Egypt"", I was struck by Irvine's ability to create imagery with ancient instrument replicas. As I read the liner notes, I realized what an amazing undertaking it must have been to create such a lush piece of music.This CD transports you to the dusty, sun-baked region of our planet where music was, and continues to be, an inherent part of the culture.I give this CD my highest recommendation. It is most definitely a fine addition to any true music lover's collection."
4,Lucid Language,"This is easily the clearest English translation available. No other translation is as easy to read and understand. However, in order to achieve this, accuracy seems to have been compromised in some passages."
1,Not a translation of the Quran,This is not merely a translation of the Quran. This guy actually changes the original Arabic verses (and admits he does so). The changes he makes insert his name in the Quran and claim him to be God's messanger. Funny!
5,The best English translation of the Quran on earth today.,"All I can say is: Do not listen those who criticize this translation. Find out for yourself. This is indeed the best English translation of the Quran. When you read this translation, you will find out the discovery of the Mathematical Miracle of the Quran, the reasons behind the miseries in the Islamic world, the satanic deceptions of the Mullahs/Imams/Sheikhs and their fabricated books: Hadith and Sunnah. You will also discover what Idolworship is all about (the only unforgiveable sin), and that the Muslims, without a doubt, did to Muhammad what Christians did to Jesus. Allah is not their God anymore, Muhammad is their lord and master. Find out more and read this translation of the Quran. May God guide us all into His path. Peace."
1,Number of Sheets in Package?,"I was really disappointed to find only 5 sheets in this envelop. The package picture has 'fuzzed out' the circle with '5'. When Amazon or whoever lined up the comparisons the others had 10 sheets, so I assumed! DaThis product printed well, but the photos after using the prescribed treatment are dull and look washed out. In addition the 'peeling' of the paper must be done very, very carefully. I ruined my first sheet when the sticky part of the paper could not be removed from the sheet. The whole paper must be peeled in one piece. Instructions did not outline that important point.Thus with shipping, my cost for five sheets was actually $4 each or $5 each with the ruined first sheet. I would not order or use this product again."
3,Great if you get a good package,These are great if you get a good package. I bought 3 packages of these for a quilt and the first 2 were great and the 3rd package the backing would NOT come off the paper. It would just rip and separate and would NOT come off! So frustrating for the amount of $ you pay for them they should work. Will be contacting the company to see if they will send me a new package but just beware that it is possible that they won't come off from the backing.
5,Great for cloth books,"I've been using this fabric to make cloth travel books for my one year old. I upload pictures, lay everything out using Powerpoint, print to the fabric, cut, and sew together. It takes about a half an hour, and makes the LIGHTEST, MOST PACKABLE books for travel. I can pack 10 books in the space it takes to pack a t-shirt. It gets a little pricey, but when space is a premium it's worth it. ""My Favorite Things,"" ""People Who Love Me,"" and ""Things I Like Doing"" are current favorites."
1,Did not work,Nice design but I must have recieved a dud as it was not recognized by either of two PCs running Win XP via USB2.0 connection including when USB power sharing cable was connected.
3,"Good, but a little dilute","The book lives up to its brag of providing information on Windows 98 that is comprehensible to people who are not techno-geeks. It also addresses the kinds of questions that can be urgent to newcomers (e.g., ""Where did all my stuff go?"" or ""Why won't my computer respond?"") However, the information is diluted with more chat and cuteness than is needed; I think twice as much information could have been provided in this number of pages (and at this price) without compromising understandability. Perhaps then there wouldn't have had to be so many recommendations to go get ""More Windows 98 for Dummies"" and other ""Dummies"" books. In short: I recommend it for anyone confronted with Windows 98 and feeling a little helpless about it (as I was after upgrading from Windows 3.1), but don't expect to become very proficient based upon this book alone."
4,A very good ep,"This ep almost seems more like an ep to supplement Bring It On rather than Liquid Skin, and could almost be seen as a bridge between the 2.The songs are pretty good, very understandable why dajon song could never be released on a full album (at 13.33 min long) but machismo, touchin up and waster could easily fit onto either but also not.The only downfall of this ep is Do's and Don'ts, a warbling stoner kind of song which never really goes anywhere. Touchin Up has a nice We Haven't Turned Around orchestral feel to it, Waster is a cute little acoustic rock number and many people may already know Machismo from Gone in 60 Seconds, and finally the Dajon Song is a kick back and chill song for a long long time.Very worthwhile getting."
1,Whatever,"Sorry, but if you want to listen to Green Day, go buy a Green Day CD. These guys are flagrant rip-offs. Don't waste your money."
5,What a great book!,My daughter is almost 4 and now sleeps with this book. The images are soft as what it is saying. It is peaceful and so well done. We have checked it out so many times we decided to buy it. You should too!
4,Cute toy ... my son likes it,"Tiny Love makes some cute toys ... so we thought we'd try this one. It makes a fun noise when the balls are dropped through the opening at the top and they easily roll to the front to come out. It also has soft rings for stacking. He still plays with it when he comes across it, and he's now 18 months old.UPDATE: This toy is now six years old in our home (bought for our first child) ... and is now being enjoyed by our fourth child! Still a wonderful product! Thank you!!"
2,"Great if you have ADD, otherwise pass on this","Agree with other reviewer - horrible editing, cheesy effects - what was Joe thinking? I'd go with either of his other two live DVDs over this any day"
1,"Awesome peformance, terrible editing.","I also have to agree with the rest of these reviews. Joe is an amazing guitarist, and always will blow everyone of us away, but his decision to release this DVD was a mistake. The editing crew made the DVD unwatchable with all the special effects, and I strongly suggest to just go with purchasing the CD, or wait until hopefully Joe decides to release this again without the over-editing. As stated in all of the previous reviews, Joe plays absolutely amazing in Paris, and the band is tighter than ever. It is just painful on the eyes to watch this DVD. Had to watch the DVD in 3 sessions, taking breaks every 30 minutes or so.Amazing guitar playing, terrible editing."
1,wow... complete waste of greenbacks,"Satch fan from the beginning... but the video is terrible like they used a compact camera. Video off my elph is better than this quality. My wife and I could not make it through 1 song... I was waiting for the ""real"" video to start and never happened, ugh! 5 mins later it was off. :("
4,Great book for young readers,I remember reading this book back in 1975 when I was in elementary school. I absolutely loved this series by Augusta Stevenson on famous Americans. This George Washington book was actually written in 1942 and has had several printings including this 90s version repackaged and newly illustrated for todays elementary reader. I really question the historical facts and details in this series but I will encourage my 3 children to read it simply because it is very entertaining and it helps develop vocabulary.
5,"Mickey Newbury, A lost Treasure.","To not know of or hear Mickey's music is missing out on one of the best songwriters America had to offer in Music. I have never had anyone of any music taste, not like Newbury's Style of music. With all the junk and noise out there now, His music is a wonderful place to go. It's different and sometimes hard to follow but that's what makes it special. You actually find yourself focusing into the words and more importantly, the messages. Mickey is a refreshing diversion from the rest of the world around you."
2,What happened to editing?,"Although I found this text interesting, and mostly informative, the practice of editing seems to have slipped through the cracks. And for this purpose, I offer my eye for future editions! The order of content, as well as combining similar themes, could have been a bit more well thought out."
5,Tiger Woods An American Master by Nicholas Edwards,"Have you ever wondered how Tiger Woods became famous? Well in this book Tiger Woods An American Master by Nicholas Edwards you will find out everything. Tiger got started at golf from his dad. Every day when Tiger's dad went to play golf, Tiger would watch from a hightchair. At 11 months old Tiger took his first shot. He used a putter his dad cut down for him. At eighteen months old Tiger learned how to putt. At three years old Tiger already had perfect form. At five years old Tiger already has shelves filled with trophies. He loved golf and knew it would be his future. Tiger signed up for a golf club as a senior. In the golf game he made his way through the beginning. He almost got a record of 62 but only got a 63. As he went farther in the tournament he could be a master. Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to read Tiger Woods An American Master by Nicholas Edwards."
5,intel rules,Ive been using this motherboard for just over 2 years I feel that this product is worth its weight in gold one word for it reliable. thank you brad
2,ADG silverside double rifle case,"I bought this several years ago and I've used it regularly since. The velcro tie downs inside the case come in handy when carrying two rifles, though with the room only one can really have a scope. The outer shell is very durable and overall the case is light and sleek. The latches and hinges are very weak and my overall impression is of low quality. I have to realign the case latches every time I want to close it. I now carry some WW2 rifles in this case and I use Pelican 1750 cases for my more valuable rifles. Overall I wouldn't advise buying this case, for the price you can do much better."
3,Some useful and interesting info,Barry Huggins does a good job providing some interesting infomation about how use specific tools to improve your pictures with photoshop. Most of the examples are easy enough to follow for the novice photoshop user but there are a few examples that are very clear on how to execute or interpet.But still a very good resource for anyone looking to enhance their own pictures.
2,Don't Buy It For DS,The game play on this is absolutely awful. It's hard to control the characters and you fight the same enemies over and over again. Don't waste your money like I did.
2,Not what was expected,"Catching glimpses of the series while channel surfing, this looked like an interesting story to get involved with. The dramatic opening scene, one of the best I can recall, seemed to confirm that this would be an engaging series.However, as the remainder of the first episode progressed, it was clear that the initial impression was wrong. I found the characters predictable and uninteresting."
4,Production gives a relevant picture of medieval life,"I originally watched the DVD, ""Los Pillares de la Tierra"" in dubbed Spanish as a weekly series by VME on the Latino channel. As a student of medieval history, specifically Norman/English (UK), I was impressed by the foreign film makers' filming locations, studio settings (when used) and selection of actors. The script and sequences kept well to the context of Follett's novel, acknowledging the latter's literary license in characterizing some of the leads--i.e. King Stephen, his son Eustace, the Bishop and some of the actual Earls of the realm, of the period. The overwhelming power of the Roman Catholic Church and the protracted wars and upheavals of the time, understanding the lack of impunity with which the aristocracy and royalty interpreted moral behavior and practiced malevolent corruption, coupled with the backdrop of appalling conditions rendered by the feudal system: all are credibly captured in the DVD for the viewing public."
1,Disappointed,"We bought this product three weeks ago, actually my husband bought it for me as a gift as we both loved the book. On inserting the disc into our DVD player it did not work. We have two DVD players and they both say ""disc error"". Given we live in Australia, the best country in the world why does it not work??? HELP"
3,Like most movies the book is better.,"The story comes to life in the DVDs based on my conception from the book, however the book is better. Still I'm happy to have watched the DVDs and my do so a second time."
4,Not for the kids but good.,"So great to get back to the true miniseries that tells a story from beginning to end and not written week to week, season to season to keep an audience. As for the acting I thought Ian McShane as the treacherous Bishop Waleran did a good job while Sam Claflin as Richard was not as convincing as a conquering Knight and at times a little wooden in his performance. Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder and each of the female leads were all good. The bloody and gruesome battle scenes were shorter than you would expect from this kind of epic while the germ of the stories focus was more about the ambitions of each of the main characters as they manoeuvred to achieve what each of them wanted."
4,Well-made adaptation of the book,"As a rule, it's nearly always impossible to perfectly transfer a book to a movie/miniseries/series without some compromises along the way, and from a very pedantic point of view, the 8 episode series version of Ken Follett's The Pillars Of The Earth is no exception.Having said that, the adaptation is nonetheless rather good, and while not perfectly following the book, it does follow the original story rather closely.One must bear in mind that the author had a consultative role in the production of the series, and therefore we must assume that he approved of what took place.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this series to anyone who has read and enjoyed the book, and also to those who have not read the book but enjoy films etc in this genre. I certainly enjoyed it, and I know I will be looking at it again in the future."
3,Were My Expectations Too High?,"My husband and I read the book. In fact, after reading his book, we read every book he published. This should speak to our admiration of the author.On the other hand, the series was as bad as the book was good. Maybe our expectations were too high.What else is there to say: the movie was better that the usual gratuitous violence, comic book style sex, bla, bla, bla.I hope this was helpful. Cheers!"
5,A very good film that most people will definitely enjoy,"The truism that books are generally better than the films that are based on them is true here but, nevertheless, the film is excellent. The acting, action, plots, scenery, and everything else is very good. The book has much more details and some differences from the film. I recommend this film. Each of the eight parts takes about 54 minutes. I also recommend the book, which, as I said, I believe is better. Although the book is long, it is worth every minute of time spent reading it. I will not summarize the film or the book since the summary presented by Comcast is quite extensive and good."
3,Held my attention but... unintentional camp?,"I enjoyed the show, firstly. I had only vaguely heard of the novel, but I like midevial period pieces and Ian McShane is a friggin hoot in anything. ""Pillars"" didn't quite live up to my expectations, but I didn't feel like I wanted that 8 hours of my life back afterward, either. The action scenes were entertaining, and I don't mind a little T&A, but the the characters were too one dimentional and the script seemed contrived at times. It was the TV version of a B movie at times."
5,Pillars of the Earth,"The video is somewhat different than the book but the author was on the set and the screenplay pulled the best stuff from the book and made an excellent mini-series. He even has a cameo appearance in one of the France settings. Well made and produced, this movie is one of my very favorites."
5,Great mini series!,This was a great movie in my opinion! Movies of this type have been just about forgotten in the industry. The characters are great and the acting and special effects are perfect! Plan on watching it again!
4,I love the story.,"I love this story and all of the actors. However, the violence and sex scenes were more extensive than the book and good parts of the story line were omitted to make time for them. I guess sex and violence attracts a larger audience than furthering the story for the general public, but not for me."
3,Pillars Of The Earth - Entertaining But Shallow,"Ken Follet's book ""The Pillars Of The Earth"" is well reproduced in this Hollywood mini-series. So, like Follet's book, the movie is shallow, moving along story lines that are predictable and only mildly dramatic. Curiously, I bought and enjoyed reading the book and watching the video enough to continue on with World Without End (book and mini-series now showing). But both are best reserved for those days when mindless entertainment is the goal."
5,Looks real,"The dog looks fantastic. It looks pretty durable too, but time will tell. The child absolutely loves it because it looks so real."
5,The best live cd of this year,"I was amazed when i bought this new release. face to Face is a great band that mixes words in a manner that allows you to know the songs as fast as you hear them. On second listen you will find yourself driven to join in the rantings. Of course this is the way of poppy punk! There is little talking, and none that serves to impress with dumb drug comments (such as in the NOFX live album which strains to get attention ***) If there is one punk album that will give you your moneys worth, this is it."
5,Awesome,The jersey arrived not long after I ordered it and in perfect condition. It looks awesome and fits perfectly. Really superb job.
2,Soul Train Video,The video is full of ads. It should have been limited just to the show without the commercials... Half of the time is devoted to commercials of products. Poorly recorded
5,You Can Put Your Own Schoolwork Into This One,"Although the Study Helpers has only 3 games on each disc, they allow you to enter your own math problems and spelling words. I find that the children learn their spelling and math memory problems much faster when they are able to play games which they already know. The beauty of having a computer game is that the child has to respond quickly and thus is really learning to be able to remember what they are trying to learn. This is especially helpful with the multiplication facts as some children try to skip count their way through the testing process and find themselves in trouble later on."
2,The game is too fast paced,"I was excited to find a study helper that could be customized and this product allowed me to choose spelling words and arithmetic problems that my son should have been able to manage. Although the theme was fun and very much like a game that it kept my son interested, I found that choosing the answers was too fast paced. My son became anxious about missing his answers, rather than spending time working out the answers. If there was a way to reduce the speed, I'd be a happy mom."
2,Ewww pretty lame stuff,"Thankfully Amazon lets you sample this stuff online, because these covers are pretty lame. About the only one I enjoyed was the Vapors tune remake, the rest if I bought this disc I know I would never listen to. Much prefer the originals and the whole idea of a cover is to be different and I guess they are but not in a way that I want to listen to it. It's just like all the covers being rehashed on Pop 40 radio with No Doubt doing Talk Talk's ""It's My Life"" (at first I thought it was Madonna), and someone else did a Cure hit recently that charted well, it's like oh you poor people that don't know how good the ORIGINAL versions are! I asked an early 80's ""Retro"" DJ at a radio station to play ""Smash it Up"" by The Damned, he said ""what the song done by The Offspring?"". He lost all credibility after that point. Just get the original stuff and be much happier."
4,Good book for advanced studies,This was a required text for a nursing class at Penn State. It is easily understood for a complex subject. The only drawback I have is the print is a little small for me.
1,Cheap cashmere.....,"For the price....this is cheap cashmere. Very thin...Chinese made...I was very disappointed...This is only one ply...Wish the sweaters would have been better...From a company like this, I would expect better."
3,Good and cute,"Sometimes I use it as a warm up in my kids show. The kids enjoy it.In truth I wish someone was manufacturing the ""Classic Monkey wth Cymbals."""
4,Good enough,"I was hoping this would be like the one I used to have as a kid. Of course, nothing is made like it used to be. This is alright. Since my son loves Toy Story 3, I thought he would love this. He doesn't really recognize it as one from the movie. He still plays with it and has some fun with it."
4,My Grand daughter loves it!,"I would have given this 5 stars, but my monkey didnt come in the box as shown in the photo which makes me wonder if it wasnt a returned item? I took a star away as my message to American Science & Surplus. But I AM rating the TOY now arent I? This toy is worthy of purchase. Its cute, seems well made, does what it is supposed to do, and will entertain small children! I would buy it again.However, I do not see any educational value in this toy. You flip a switch and the monkey beats his symbols. Flip the switch off, and the monkey stops. Its pretty simple- a real no brainer really."
5,Retrovirus Review,Great book!!Very suspenseful; I could not put it down. It was so fast-paced that I had to finish it the same day I started. It reminded me of an Indiana Jones movie - you're totally captivated. The outcome was not predictive which just increased the suspense. I think it will affect every reader and make them think about the real purpose of their life. 'Big thumbs up!'
4,Amazonia Stackable Eucalyptus Chair,"The chair is unstable but perhaps when I find an Allen wrench and tighten the joints it will be stable. That said, it is as lightweight, attractive and comfortable sizewise as I'd hoped."
2,Disappointed,"With all the great reviews I read, I've been anxiously awaiting the miracle bra that would FINALLY allow me to work out with DDD's and not have them all over the place. After waiting 4 days for the order to finally ship and then 6 more for it to actually get here, it arrived! However, I couldn't even try it out! The band size is way, way, WAY off. I normally wear a 38 DDD/E/F (depending on the store). Not knowing how their bras fit, I decided to go up to a 38 G (the largest the have), just in case. You can see how I definitely didn't expect it to be too small!! Both tags read 38 G but it fits like a 32 DDD! I couldn't even get it CLOSE to closing and I know it's not me, because I have absolutely no problem fitting any other 38's. Might be a great bra if you can actually get it on, but I wouldn't know. I recommend going up quite a few sizes...."
2,horrible,"the metal bars rub your shoulders (yep, that's right, the adjustable straps are made of THICK metal). And there is nooo lining in the cup area. Plus it comes really tight, and this item is very difficult to return."
4,old school blink,"this cd is very good, but if you're just getting into blink 182 now, or a teeny bopper, then it's not for you, this is not the same as enema of the state, this is punk rock, not all the small things pop stuff, i love this album, it's worth it, check out chesire cat too"
5,"Pretty good, really different from Enema of the State","i think this cd was really good, especially b/c it was done in toms garage and mark was sick. if u like pop then u'll like enema of the state cuz that was definately influenced by that kinda music. if u like moshing then you'll like this! if your a blink fan you have to buy this cd!"
5,Blink 182 at their best!,"The first time I heard Blink 182 was their song ""Carosel,"" which is on this album. It is still the greatest song of theirs ever. I have found that the best songs from a band are on their earlier albums, and this is just one more band that proves it. I recomend this CD to any Blink 182 fan."
4,Excellent cd/ yet not as punk as dude ranch,Has great songs on the record I would recomend it for blink fan
4,Good not as good as Dude Ranch or Cheshire Cat,It's a good CD. It says it's not out but I bought it about 4 mounths ago
2,"It's OK, but not as good as the others","This is an okay CD, but I still think Cheshire Cat CD was way better. Probably because in this one they couldn't sing on key at all. Then again, the other CD's were made later, so that's probably why. It has some of the songs from Cheshire Cat, like Carosel and Strings,but if you're looking for the best of Blink 182, I don't think this is it."
2,haha,"As a general rule, this House series is quite boring and uneventful, except the last episode, which is brilliant. I think choosing the Cooke family was an AWFUL decision. They are not only ignorant, but REALLY annoying! If you're interested in the House programs, I would definitely reccommend Frontier and Manor."
3,Texas Ranch House,"This latest historical ""reality"" program is meant to recreate life on a post-civil war era ranch in the Lone Star state. I've always found these sorts of programs to be quite entertaining and informative, but unfortunately, these experiments rarely seem to work out, and as a result can sometimes prove difficult to watch. This case is no exception, as most of the participants hardly seemed up to the task and were much too intent on maintaining their 21st century attitudes--in particular the self-professed ""hero"" Maura--to make the project a success. Pettiness and negative tension runs rampant through this one, and I found myself not all that committed to watching it through its entirety. Despite this, the program does still have a certain amount of educational value from a historical standpoint, and in the end learned a little more about ranching during this era."
5,Walking on air with florsheim.,A classy stylish comfortable pair of shoes leather uppers and soles.From day one the fit was just perfect and suit both casual and formal attire. Quality.Highly recommended.
1,Defective inner soles,"Florsheim makes great shoes. I've worn them for a long time, and they're generally great. That being said, the ones I purchased through this buy were clearly defective. The inner sole started to come apart not a week after I bought them! For cheap junk, this would be unacceptable- for Florsheims, it's unbelievable."
3,"Good plot, weak characterization and dialogue","What a facinating contradiction this book is. The plot is amazing and original. Ms. Groell has used magecraft to simulate modern technology in a totally unique and refreshing way. And yet... her characterizations are quite weak and her dialogue is so inconsistent with her medieval fantasy setting that I found it jarring. Despite the flaws, which were serious, I think this is an excellent first effort."
2,What a cheap looking product that is not lit uniformly,This product is cheap-looking and is not lit uniformly. Only the heads are lit up by the lights as the gingerbread men are too big for the lights inside them (ergo it only lights the head). I'm not happy that I chose this item and will be ending it back to get a different product.
3,"Great Idea, So-so Execution","I wish the book had more recipes and less talk on healthy living. Haven't we all been talked to death on making good choices? I wanted help making those choices easier to live with. I've made five of the recipes. Some were good, others were okay. I haven't come across one that I would entertain with, but I don't think that's the point. The heavy spices are tough with young kids, but I'll adjust from now on. I love the grocery lists."
3,downloaded ebook.,"The book was accurate and helpful, but I expected more creativity, resources and enjoyment. I m not sure I would recommend it."
4,Great CD but different from Disclaimer,"If you like seether because of Broken feat. Amy Lee then you might be a little dissapointed. This cd shows a harder Seether much more similar to Gasoline from Disclaimer. A very good cd and it does have a few slow down moments after Never Leave. The hiiden 14th track is quite an interesting listen. Overall, a good cd, but not for people that like Seether just for the duet with Amy Lee."
4,For Grandaughter's,Duck tape projects. They are perfect for her to create whatever designs she wants. I had fun doing it with her.
5,Deliscious,I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to come across products that meet my criteria. But these cookies do it. They also taste deliscious. It is hard to believe that they are not made from wheat. They also taste very fresh.
4,Love This Book!,"Jeff is a really great writer. I really like his style, it's like just having a conversation. The book talks about the many different ways people try to communicate with spirits using talking boards, card, and there's also ghost photography plus many other ways."
1,not sure what to make ..,My son loves it... watching all three series since 2 years ... but now he is 4 years old and prefers to sign over speech. we received concerns from his teachers about delayed speech. We are consulting a speech therapist
4,Great video series,"These videos were great for my son who started watching them when he was about 15 months. after a couple times of watching them he started using the signs (we also worked with him on some of them). He has a speech delay so these videos were instumental in his communication with us. We have the whole series. he is 2.5 now and still loves them, we plan on using them with his younger sister who is now 8 months. I do think these videos are great for introducing signing but once they have mastered the basics the signing time series is the way to go. My son loves those videos too and now has about 100 signs. Those are great because they incorporate music with fun songs to learn signs."
3,good baby sign video,There are pros and cons the non signing part keeps our daughter's attention it is similar to baby einstein however the expressionless lady who does the signs is not as good at as in baby signing time. Overall it has it's good qualities and we like to have a variety.
2,"Good looking mat, but sheds","Nice looking mat. That's all. Wouldn't clean any thing off your feet, it's close to wiping your feet on a piece of wood, it's that hard. Worst of all it sheds, thousands of little hairs are always coming out, all over my entrance. It now sleeps with the fishes."
3,WORTH YOU TIME,"A LOT OF YADDA YADDA FILLING UP SPACE LIKE A LOT OF BOOKS BUTTHE CHAPTER ON THE FINDINGS ON MARS IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THEBOOK ALONE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHATS OUT THERE, DON'T PASSTHIS UP.GENE ADDINGTON"
1,What are they thinking?,I see no connection at all between the content of this book and how to look at photographs. It includes timeless historic photographs and Finn's own less than remarkable examples of the craft. What it does not include is any framework whatsoever as a guide to looking at photographs. Where was the editor? Is this vanity press? Jeez.
4,A piece of history,"""The Children of Huang Shi"" is based on the true story of the English writer George Hogg, portrayed by Jonathon Rhys Meyers (The Tudors) and his quest to save the boys of a destitute orphanage. This takes place during the Japanese occupation of China around 1937. Radha Mitchell also stars in this movie as the nurse, Lee Pearson, who moved about China helping where she could. She travels with George and the boys on an extraordinary 700 mile hike to escape the Japanese. This trek takes them far into the bowels of China along Marco Polo's silk road in search of a safe place to live. The scenery is as amazing as the story. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Great book,"I've read several bandsaw books, and this one is my favorite. Some of the information feels a little bit dated, since it is about 25 years old, but all the technique and general bandsaw information is tops. Highly recommended."
4,Does the job,"These are pretty sturdy and do give enough height to mount a 50mm scope AND still use the iron sights. The anodizing is pretty thin and scratches easily. They are aluminum, high strength... I assume. Good fit on the 1"" scope tube but quite tight on the dovetail groves on the rifle. I had to use a large pair of snapring pliers to spread it out enough to get on the rifle without scratching it up."
3,Wonderful story wonderfully told,"I am in the minority of people who read this and had a hard time getting through it, I know. It was a brutally difficult story for me to work through, but others in my class embraced it and loved the protagonist. I enjoyed the writing, which is suburb and the landscape - both physical and emotional. It is a tour de force."
3,Strange Landscape,"This was a book club choice and it certainly instigated a rousing discussion among our members. The general concensus was that it was well written but with an obscure thread of purpose. It touches on madness, lonliness, aparteid, domination and subjegation. Personally, I would rather have taken a course in any of these subjects than to have tried to pick out the pieces from this book. One thing of interest (though I can't say I saw the reason for it) is that it is the only book I have ever read where each paragraph is numbered."
2,Good for few times,I had this for 2 yrs during which I used couple of times to jump start my car. The battery does not charge any more and I am left this 10 lb crap in my garage.
5,"great lock for toddlers, definitely not hard for adults to open!","i use this on all cabinets they work great i can quickly open them with one hand,and very neat design.."
4,Serves it's purpose,"We got these to block off the last two places that my 1 year old was opening up. It stopped him, so that was the point. These are very tight and hard to work, even for adults though. I had to put them on doors that I don't get into much."
1,Idiotic design!,"I had a couple of these locks for my first child 6 years ago and they worked well. Since then, they've re-designed it: now you have to press down on either side of the lock to get it loose. Problem is, once this thing is behind your cabinet knobs, there's no room to get your fingers between the lock and the cabinet door, so this beastie is adult-proof as well as child-proof. I can't for the life of me understand why they wrecked a what WAS a good product. (Formerly, the release button was located on top of the lock and remained accessible when installed.)"
1,Baby Haven products Are The Worst,They will hassle you to no end if you get something you don't like. I bought a product from them that wasn't safe and they wanted to charge shipping and restocking! The most terrible company on Amazon without a doubt.
5,Hilarious! A cool book that gets you results,"Despite the somewhat comic nature of this book, it has all the microbiology material required for doing well on the USMLE Step 1. General Principles, Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi and Parasites are presented in sections. There is also great chapters on antibiotics and antivirals. For FMGs who have never lived in the United States, it might be difficult to relate to many of the jokes presented in this book as they are pop-culture related. That, I suspect, will render this book not as desirable by some. Otherwise, studying this book will probably be the most entertaining part of the preparation for the USMLE Step 1."
5,Faboulous,This book really makes microbiology fun to read and simple to remember. One of the best books around!
5,review of cliff's notes on house made of dawn,"I always like Cliff's notes. as always, this partiular study guide explored different facets of the novel and had excellent studyquestions. I use Cliff's Notes after I read a book, beccause I want to be sure I didn't miss anything. I do wish you also had a study guide for Momaday's novel The Ancient Child."
2,Too much and too little of everything,"The first half of the book I enjoyed enough to keep reading, although I had a bit of trouble keeping all the characters straight. About half way through I felt like pages or chapters were missing. The story line jumped around erratically, there was a random character name thrown in who didn't appear anywhere else, and it just felt very disjointed. There was tons of detail about streets and suburbs if you were familiar with that area of NYC (which I'm not), but it just left me feeling like an outsider (what's Ditmas - a street, a suburb, a restaurant?). There are too many characters to keep up with and too little detail to make them real or connected in a meaningful way. Additionally, this working single mother, Emma, has two young children but appears to never have to shop for food, do laundry, get gas, or find a babysitter. For me, it was too much detail on unimportant things and too little believability in the actual juggling of daily life for Emma."
2,Harms the Instrument,"I used this shoulder rest in the past with my old instrument. A major problem with it is that the rubber on the grips wears off, exposing the metal that holds the shoulder rest to the violin. This has the potential to harm the instrument by scratching it. My old violin suffered some scratches as a result. This should rest is also uncomfortable for me."
4,Good quality for coin wrappers,Made wrapping coins easier. Would not use if just taking coins to bank and putting in a sorting machine. Some sort of plastic holder is needed to feed pennies into wrappers. These are great if you are keeping coins for a while.
1,Out of Date,"This handbook was great in its day, but is now woefully out of date. The most up to date publication of this nature is the Special Operations Forces Medical Handbook, 2008, edited by COL Rocky Farr and others. It is a hardcopy and is available through the Government Printing Office for $59.A new DVD version of the Special Operations Forces Medical Handbook was published in August 2010 by the Government Printing Office, and is available from them for $25. It contains additional information on trauma, pediatrics, infectious diseases, dermatology. In addition, it has 1,400+ clinical photos and illustrations, and 100 videos."
4,A must have for operational forces!,"A must have for operational forces! It cover a broad range of items that will give you valuble information. Unless you are a doctor, you need this book while on the ground! The only problem, it's not that easy to find the information you need quickly."
4,Very Nice,"This is more than just ""Bach lite"" with his pieces played on a variety of different instruments. The music is given a decidedly Brazilian flavor. This works better on some pieces than others, but the overall effect sounds quite good to my ears. It is nice to hear the old familiars with a new and pleasing twist. I particularly liked tracks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 12 & 14. The current $40 price seems waaay too high, however. I got mine at the library."
1,Right in the trash can,"If I could have given a minus 1 for this book I would have. I love books and treat them as valued possessions, so when I tell you I got half-way through this book and threw it in the trash, you will know how bad I think it was. I only wish there had been more reviews of this book before I purchased it.I could go on in greater detail, but I think the first review sums it up nicely.What a waste of money this was."
2,"good product, but the ""sticky"" isn't sticky enough it was bumped and fell right off...",The sticky stuff on the back isn't strong enough if it is bumped it will fall off... otherwise they are great. Just need to find something that will stick better.
2,Very Similar to Volume One of this Series,"The music is lovely and spiritual, just like the first volume of the Goddess Series, Goddess Awakening vol. 1. And therein lies the problem. With the exception of a single track, Dream, the songs on Vol. 2 are very similar if not exactly the same as those on Vol. 1. While this may be an artistic decision, as a consumer I really don't need to spend additional money on tracks that are either identical or so similar that they are indistinguishable. My recommedation is to choose whichever order you prefer and purchase only one."
5,Thorough look at California Indian life,"This book provides a fascinating and comprehensive glimpse into the daily lives of pre-contact California Indians. It is laid out in easy to use chapters that provide just enough information to be complete, but still include local examples and myths to add flavor to the narrative. My only complaint is that some of the skills are a bit complicated and are confusing to read. I guess you just have to go out to the wilderness and try it out! This is a must-read for anyone interested in California Indians and their history."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most uncomfortable bed set I have ever slept on...Do not buy this bed set if you enjoy sleeping...
4,"Buy this book if you want to facts, plain and simple.",This book is very good for someone who is on a beginning or somewhat intermediate level of perspetive drawing. It offers interesting tips and fun to look at pictures. If you are looking for a simpllififed way to learn about perspective at a bargain price this is the book for you!
2,Big Disappoinment,"I love to read and I was hoping this book would have some inspiration for children. In my opinion it does not. As a retired librarian I doubt any of my ""kids"" would have picked it up and checked it out."
2,not what you might think...,"If you're looking for the Berestain Bears your little one watches on sprout/pbs, this is not it. We were so excited to find this and sat down to watch only to be disappointed. The characters are more extreme than the tv ones, the verbal interaction is less thought out, and they don't necessarily represent the good relationships and interpersonal interactions that the tv show does. We didn't even finish the dvd,bottom line, my son didn't like it."
1,Will deface cabinet,These KidCo Magnet Locks require defacing the front of your cabinet. I had thought the magnets would work without putting screwing or glueing something on the outside of the cabinet.
2,READ CAREFULLY,"This is only the key NOT the lock!!! This can not be used as a stand alone product. In order to use the key you must already have purchased the locks. Make a sure you read carefully. I found the descriptions confusing!!I gave this particular product two stars, because the key and key holder set is unnecessary. I suggest buying the starter set, to determine if the locks work for you and then you can order more locks. This lock key and holder is only if you want an extra key.On a side note, I did go back and order the locks (the package of four, which doesn't come with a key) and I love the concept! It works wonderfully, was easy to install and required no drilling! My husband was also very impressed."
2,Not my cup O tea,"I didn't like this book and hoped it would of been good since I read most of the other reviews. I didn't agree with the techniques. Not my cup O tea, made me think of fluffy filler with candies and puppies."
5,Excellent book on clairvoyance!,"This is the best book on psychic development and clairvoyance that I have come across yet. It is well written and I have found the exercises to work on numerous occasions. She shows how the images we create in our mind contain much more information about us and the world around us than we normally realize. The technique used in ""Secrets of the Cube"" is similar to her technique of interpreting roses. Excellent book!"
4,parce que c'est toi,"it's one of my favorites. the words and music is really nice. if you want to hear a sample of it, go to her site, just search for axelle red and it'll lead u to it. she's my favorite french singer"
3,Met My Needs,"I work for a covenants department for a large home-owner's asscociation. The Olympus WCON-07F Wide Conversion Lens is great for taking wide-angle shots of properties and meets my needs. As this is just an add-on lens and is not adjustable, it is very limited and I would never compare it to a camera with a wide-angle lens.Olympus WCON-07F Wide Conversion Lens for Olympus SP-310/350 Digital Cameras"
4,Mad nice,This is my favorite add-on for my camera. I like it because it widens the image and also has protection for the lens and it comes with a pouch to store it in.
5,history remembered,"Let not history be forgotten, lest it be repeated. This film series provides unquestionable reminders of why the world now watches diligently its neighbors. Hitler could have beeen stopped in the early days when he flexed his muscles, and these films prove it. some would label them as propoganda, but the truth is World War 2 needed no propoganda to be fought. It was an unfortunate part of history, and this fiolm helps to remember and pray it never happens again."
5,Well worth the money,"This book paid for itself in the first week. The time it has saved me with it's well organized index, intelligent layout, and source code examples makes this my only Access97 Desktop reference. If your already an Access developer, or if you want to be one, buy this book."
2,Nothing New,Did not do much of a job for the money. Alot of information that when presented in the format that it is does not help build an application. I refer to it every so often when looking for specific information.
5,Good value,This text book was much cheaper than the copy from the school or any local bookstore. Process and shipped really quickly. I wouldn't suggest this is casual reading.
3,pretty dry,"Although I will occasionally get an interesting point from this study guide, as a group we have a hard time getting any real good discussion going from it. It's not worthless but I believe that there has to be something out there that would be more effective. My first night facilitating I had 17 people attend with a few I knew could not come the first week. We've had 4 sessions now and I'm down to 8 consistently. Disappointing knowing I had so many with high hopes of really getting to know the Holy Spirit through this"
4,A whole lot of fun,"This books make you want to go goof around with a video camera. Though I'm not a ""filmmaker"", I did find a lot of useful tips and techniques to make the family videos a little less boring. A few of the effects depend on software - and knowing how to use it. Though I don't believe it says what software specifically, from the examples it is clearly Final Cut on a Mac.Anyway, lots of fun and pretty useful - even if you're not a ""filmmaker""."
2,silicone implants,"I call it this because although it looked great: heavy stock glossy pages & pictures-under closer examination I was disappointed-perhaps after 12 yrs of ""event"" video i know more than i thought- staring out with lighting vs. equipment set me back right away-a separate more in depth section on actual software use would have helped too-I'm pretty good at imovie BUT not FCP or Avid- I assume those that are are already familiar with the basics & tech tricks-I would have sent it back since I was looking for more indie film info but will probably find it helpful for a community school class I'm giving-beginners new & advanced WILL find this book helpful though."
4,WWE JOHN CENA CHAMPIONSHIP SPINNER BELT,THE BELT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND MY 13 YR OLD SON LOVED IT!! THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING WAS WE HAD TO HOT GLUE MANY OF THE STONES BACK IN AS THEY KEPT FALLING OUT.
3,This Book drops the bomb,"This book provides a fascinating insight within the depths of the racial NBA. The book is a diary, so the disjointed stories are very much appreciated. Although the race issue gets tired by the conclusion of the book, it is entertaining throughout, clearly David Sheilds is a fanatic about his hometown team. I was fully satisfied with David Sheilds' interpretations and the manner in which he writes makes the reader draw many conclusions on his/her own. Great book for any fan of the NBA who, like me, always wants a little longer peak into the lives of the players, coaches and administration of the NBA."
1,"Oh, No!","The Sonics of the era this book covers were an exciting team, this book is not. By turns boring, pedantic, and just plain silly, David Shields is neither a good writer OR thinker. That is not his fault, but the people who published this book should know better. His dime-store sociological insights into the way black and white Seattle citizens interact are difficult to wade through, with absolutely no payoff once you reach the other side.Gary Payton actually is an object worthy of the type of worship seen here, but you would never know why by reading this book, which examines in detail The Glove's press conference and radio talk show utterences while saying virtually nothing about the artistry and poetry of the Man's GAME.And that's a shame. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library..."
2,Does not fit all door handles,The product works on one of my french door handles but not the other ones because they are too long.
3,Adhesive failed but good product,"This didn't keep our 2.5 year-old out. However, we weren't willing to permanently install the lock by screwing the hardware into our door. Instead, we mounted it with the adhesive tape that is included. That is the part that did not hold. Otherwise, it is a good product, and it took me several minutes to install. If you are willing to drill into the door, I imagine it would keep most toddlers out. With the adhesive method, a determined toddler can tug on the handle enough to pop the lock off the door."
3,My almost 2 yr old figured it out in under 4 hours...,"I got this about a week before my son turned two. I needed a safety lock for our back metal door, and I thought this looked like it might work. My son figured it out in under 4 hours. We still use it, and sometimes he struggles with it, but always figures out how to open it...I'm getting the Door Guardian now to see if it works better...*sigh*"
4,"Gory, But Gripping","Mr Abbott initially gives us an overview of some of the more grisly ways to meet an end, including dismemberment and deep-frying in oil. However, the presentation is detailed without being nauseating, which is quite a trick. Still, it's certainly enough to make one cringe.The anecdotes are referenced enough to allow follow up research, without being overdone. This is an entertaining read, with a certain amount of black humor mixed in of necessity. It covers errors in execution, in reprieve, mobs and crowds, horrific mistakes that caused gory ends, and the people who went to their death with dignity, humor, or kicking and screaming. In this way, it gives a measure of insight into the condemned mind, and that of the executioner and crowd. Highly recommended."
1,Very Poor,"Absolutely, one of the worst books I have ever read. What is purported to be a story of British children living in the US is instead an eclectic mishmash of British pre-war politics, introspective yearnings and compilations of nonsensical minutiae. How this book ever got published is an eternal mystery."
4,This is about the best price you're gonna find for this dosage and size,"I take this stuff all the time for my bad knees (that and MSM and other joint suppliments). This is the largest container, largest dosage for the price I've seen anywhere. So I keep ordering it. I take two a day and this container lasts a long time."
1,Questionable labeling,Exactly what is glucosamine sulfate.2HCl? If it is actually glucosamine sulfate then the 2HCl is illogical. If it is actually glucosamine hydrochloride then it should by so labeled.I want to know exactly what I am purchasing.
5,what boyz know,"ivan's is a clear and tender voice that is never sentimental. as a feminist what i found consistently striking was how powerful an unanalytical voice can be when it simply details again and again what it means to experience life as a girl when your imagination is hungry enough to identify and crave the different sorts of freedoms that boys have.ivan is a performer and each story lends itself to being read aloud . try reading one aloud to yourself and be something new - or remember something lost - in your own imagination.i recommend this volume to educators looking for appropriate stories for grade and high-school exploration of gender, sexism and homophobia. there is wry gentleness here - an open style that lets the reader choose to do as much work as each is ready to. start with ""no bikini."""
4,Duo-Cloz is reliable,"I've had one of these valves for 28 years. with a quick flip of the lever, both hot and cold water are turned on/off to your washing machine. It's never had a problem."
2,You get what you pay for,Good looking phone with disappointing voice quality. Worst is CID does not work at all.
3,Be careful -- might not be what you think,"The ""12 mm Diameter Lasagna"" attachment produces wide (~1/2 inch) flat fettuccine-like noodles, and not what I'm guessing most people expect a ""Lasagna"" noodle to be. If you Google image ""Lasagna"", what you see are noodles around two inches wide with ruffled edges. This product does not do that.I put three stars not because this product is bad, it probably works just fine, but to me the description is inaccurate and confusing. I have returned the 12mm attachment and have ordered the ""44 mm Diameter Reginette"" direct from Italy (shipping expense more than unit price) because I could not find it anywhere domestically."
2,A Polonaise of Self Indulgence,"A distinguished historian certainly has something to say, but what does a boy who left Poland at the age of 10 in 1930 have to say about Jewish life in inter-war Poland. Obviously not much. But Prof. Hamerow puts into the mouth or pen of a ten-year old the thoughts of a mature historian in his eighties. A more vain mismatch can hardly be imagined."
4,Pure escapist love story,"Okay - so the plot is a little far-reaching and unrealistic. The hero is agressively over-confident, and the heroine frustratingly runs away from conflicts instead of confronting them with open communication. But who cares when the sensuality factor is sky-high! So is the beautifully descriptive writing. This is a book for getting lost in a romantic fantasy adventure in luscious settings such as a tropical Caribbean island and a horse-breeding plantation in Virginia. It's a magical feel-good romance."
5,A unique brand of Hardcore/Metal - a classic!,"The musicians are great, the songs are great and the vocals are unique in a very cool and refreshing way. I definitely recommend this album."
3,"Quality is great, but the price not so much...","This is the genuine Canon ink cartridge. In my opinion, it is best to use manfacturers' ink (others will disagree and use generic). The quality is great and I've never had a problem with one (been buying them for 6 years or so) - but they are pricey. My Canon ip8500 takes 8 cartridges or about USD100 of ink..."
5,Genuine Canon -- The only way to go.,"This is what is says -- ink for your printer. It works perfectly. If you have a Canon printer, don't mess around with any other ink than genuine Canon. Even if it's a little more expensive, it's worth it and your printer will thank you."
4,Good for Canon printer,"This ink works great with Canon printer. Unfortunately this is the ONLY ink that works great with a canon printer. Any other ink I tried produce terrible result. So, basically if you own Canon printer you stuck with this ink, which can be a little less expensive. I gave 4 stars because the price is a bit high."
3,ink cartridges don't last very long,"These ink cartridges are easy to install and work well, but they don't last very long. It is a racket the way the sell you good printers for cheap and then bleed you dry paying for ink. I would look for printers in Consumer Reports that say they are a good value for not using up ink too fast. The non-factory refills for this unit pretty much suck. Ink leaks or smears and they are not much of a savings to begin with."
5,"Quality, Authentic Canon Cartridge",This cartridge is authentic Canon brand. It is always best to used authentic Canon ink in Canon printers. Using authentic ink ensures the highest reliability and quality from your printer. I would recommend this to anyone with a Canon printer.
5,Best Ink for Canon i960,"The best ink I have found for my Canon i960 printer is genuine Canon ink. The colors are true to life and the product works as intended with no leakage, smears or problems. I appreciate the quality of the Canon PhotoCyan BCI-6PC Genuine Canon Ink Tank."
3,Good Ink but Pricey,These are good inks but pricey. They get used up or dry up too fast. I feel like they ought to be able to make inks cheaper in todays day and age. There are people buying cheap printers for the ink cartridges and just throwing the printers away. Something is wrong with that.
1,wrong color in yellow cartridge,"Upon requesting and paying for a yellow ink cartridge, we got one filled with orange ink. We've tried several off brands and finally returned to the old standby, Canon, but our reunion has been tarnished. Not sure from whom we will buy at this point."
1,Not compatable with Kodak ESP 9 printers,Ink grabbers replacement ink Cartridges will not be recognized using a Kodak ESP 9 all in one printer. The chip on the end is different than the original and the screen has an error message stating cartridge not recognized.The instruction sheet for the color cartridge even shows a possible fix for this by modifying the chip by scraping part of the circuit board between to connections.Well this does not solve the problem so neither the black or color inks will work in this printer.I have Emailed the sales department about this problem and requested to return my order but they refused to respond. I would not recommend using any of there after market products. BUYER beware! Sincerely John B
1,Give me a break!,"Bruce Cutler is a self serving loud mouth who spends an entire book telling us what a great lawyer he is. Given the allegations of jury tampering (which was the reason he was banned from representing Gotti a third time and may be the reason Gotti was acquitted the first two times) and his pitiful track record anywhere else where the true practice of law is required, it is no wonder he wrote a book - no one who values their rights and their freedom would hire this guy."
5,this book is full of action and suspense.I enjoyed it alot,"I am 13 years old and i've read all of these books . This book is very good , but you should first read the other ones like battle dragon . I'm anxiously waiting for the new book and Mr. Rowley if you happen to be reading this please to end the Bazil of Broketail soon , it's to good of a series"
5,Saw Blade,Saw blades works as expected I use it to cut very thin veneer pieces. Very high quality edges are produced
4,Red River,"Saw blade arrive in a timely manner, and in good shape.At the high cost of gasoline, and almost every thing else, The dollar doesn't go very far. This is a very good blade at an reasonable price. There are some other very good blade on the market at a higher price, and I'm not ""knocking"" them for they are good blades, I have some of those Blades.But if you're looking for a good saw blade at a lower cost, this is the top of the line.I would have given it a 5 star but I have been trying to get a chart of FREUD's router bits and saw blade for over a year, and they won't even answer my e-mails,that why I stop buying there product, But the Forrest blade I wanted wasn't in stock and was on back order, So I bought a couple Freud blades.I want to stress it FREUD that lack in customer sevice,Not AMOZON, Amozon is very good in customer service dept."
1,Remember the beanie baby fad?,Just because something is popular doesn't make it a good idea. My firm outsourced half our processes and we lost our shirts. The Indians simply aren't familiar enough with colloquial English to talk to Americans. They're churning out IT people so quick that they're ignoring quality. And their paralegals have no idea what confidentiality means. Check out the cons of offshoring by doing a thorough web search. And don't fall for this book's shell game.
2,Not typically Donna!,"Donna Dewberry consistently produces fine detailed instructional books.........this book on murals is not much more than a ""see what Donna did"" book, the photographer did a brilliant job......... No patterns, no detail, I could care less what part of a house has these painted walls ,(content is divided by rooms). I bought the book to learn HOW she did it. Lot of pictures, beginners beware, you admire her, you wish to paint her technique, this book will tell you next to ZIP!"
3,"Great ideas, but not thorough enough for the beginner","I, like anyone who sees Donna Dewberry's works am amazed at her talent and technique. I had hoped that as a beginner I could use this book as a step by step process on how to build a mural...I was wrong. Donna does a great job of explaining things to those who are already adept at freehand paining, but for the beginner I feel that this book is too vague. There are a few sketches of an urn and a pillar, but the rest of her ideas are pretty much up to the reader to figure out how to freehand. I certainly will keep the book to look at and enjoy, but I'll have to look further for a step by step approach to murals (complete with patterns)."
3,cheaper at walmart,wal-mart has it for $13.. I used it and failed !! wish natural klean was still in buissness. they test fo 50nl min cut-off limit
2,I just don't get it,"I don't understand why these guys are the subject of so much love and hype. I got the album and listened to it several times; with the exception of the amazing ""NYC"" I couldn't find a single track that I really liked. The lead singer's voice is irritatingly monotonic and has that weird 80's feel to it that you find in bands like the Cure or even Devo. The rest of the instrumentation is good, but not striking or, in my opinion, very original. The style hasn't been done in a while, but that doesn't mean its better than any other music out there today, or better than anything it cops to get that sound. I'd say, give it a shot and you may like it more than myself (i happen to particularly dislike the kind of vocals they use), but don't think its going to change your life, like Spin or Rolling Stone or other hype machines would lead you to believe."
5,Wow,"Gen X'er here & I haven't heard anything that's gotten me this turned on for a long time. Highly Recommended, probably the best album since Radiohead's OK Computer.If you're an indie snob that's insisting on comparing it to another ""better band,"" you should probably forget it, because if you can't just listen & enjoy, then you've already ruined the trip.Sometimes loud, sometimes moody, sometimes ambiant, just altogether great. Light up & enjoy..."
1,nice package...nothing inside,"To put it briefly: this sucks. I'm not just talking about the larcenous 2CD/1 DVD product the record company cobbled together to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the original release; I'm talking about the original release. The vocals combine the whine and the drone into a single style in a way that hasn't been heard since the Smiths faded from public memory. The lyrics -- on the rare occasions when they're audible -- alternate between Dylanesque incomprehensibility and unusually embarassing excerpts from a sophomore's suicide note. Musically, there's not a memorable hook or melody to be found. No wonder ""modern rock"" died. Do not resuscitate.[Standard caution: don't bother commenting on this review or clicking the ""unhelpful"" button; I'm never going to visit this page again so you'll just be wasting your time.]"
4,touching from a distance,"All hail the new Caesar. Mastering and conquering the sound of distant bands, our four heroes march into the hallowed halls amongst much pomp and circumstance; banners waving, flags unfurled, accolades all around, glory, just a beat away. This iconoclastic moment echoes, tasting like forever. The spirit and soul of music past is alive and well. With victory at hand, these young men take their place in history. Like a Viking ship landing on our foggy shores just before new dawn. Brandishing guitar swords, moving on the sleeping villages below, the message will be delivered - sung and played unto the masses. Look out."
4,Wow! This is really good!,"After hearing the song ""PDA"" from their single, I was blown away. Yes, there is a huge Joy Division influence here, but the songs move much faster, cleaner, brighter and hooks are everywhere! This is the best album I have heard thus far for 2002 and it keeps growing and growing on me. I don't think there is a bad song on the whole album. This is highly recommended!!"
5,Nice Album,"Takes several listens, so don't give up so easily! It's a great album. Lives up to the hype"
3,I thought people in NYC had some taste!,"I finally listened to TOTBL and found myself mesmerized by the inability of my fellow reviewers to leave the comparisons aside and let this stand on it's own. Anyone with taste knows that it will fall over quite easily as it lacks any form of backbone.Just another boring example of how bands from NYC have the uncanny ability to impress the ignorant simply because they are from NYC. Yes indeed, NYC is the greatest city on the planet but Interpol leaves a great deal to be desired. It's not the worst recording I've ever heard, but it certainly isn't any better than average. I'm obviously pleased that this is taking people's attention away from The Strokes but in the end they are equally bad. Give them a few years and they will be deservedly forgotten."
4,Interesting,"Listening to this cd is like gawking at a highway accident. As unnerving as it is, one cannot look away. The obvious comparisons to Joy Division... I can see why. But that's just at the surface. That's just cosmetics. Underneath, lies a totaly different beast. At times it feels like seasoned musicians decided to forget how to play their instruments on purpose, resulting in an interesting mixture of garage punk and early eighties new wave."
5,not joy division but something mayeb even better,"they dont sound like joy division. it is said they got none of their influence from JD. When i first heard them i loved them. The thing i liked the most about them was their sense of complete style and direction over their music. Hints of their influencers are so blended into their songs, they come out a completely different style. and they're the best in concert too. one of the best bands in a long time."
2,I still don't get it,"I listen to a whole lot of music and I know you have to give a second and third and fourth listen sometimes. That I did here, but the voice was still ANNOYINGLY reminiscent of Ian Curtisand the music itself is rather dull..."
4,More of a critique of an editorial than a commentary,"Good God come on now let's not get crazy and call them peers of the Strokes. While I admit that the Strokes are fun to listen to every once in a while and have a nice lo-fi rock and roll sound, I would never go so far as to say they are sophisticated or that they can create soundscapes. Please do not judge this album based on the Amazon editorial review (which are usually very good). Otherwise, Interpol are a good band with a great sound. Good CD. Bravo."
1,save your money,"Save your money, this writer is a self described ""expert"" on kabballah, santeria, voodoo, etc. If it is a ""fringe"" belief of an accepted religion, she has written a book about it. All with the expertise of a phoney out to make a quick buck by claiming to be an authority on the subject."
4,A must for the average knife owner,"I have been making and engraving knives for over 40 years. In that time I have used just about every sharpening system and stone out there. Yes I can sharpen a knife without using this or any other system, using only my large stones and hones. However to get the proper angles on a blade this system does a good job. The diamond stones keep their shape better than the Arkansas stones, which eventually start wearing in the center. Using this system takes a little effort and time but the results are worth it. In the 1970's I used to sell these and I still have some of the original stones that are still usable. Perfect ? No...Very good ? Yes...."
3,"Parable, yes; Fiction, no","I had no expectations reading this book, and found it to be an engaging read on a purely spiritual/theological level. I agree with practically all of Girzone/Joshua's points about religion, yet found myself wishing that it had been better written. Perhaps the greatest appeal of the book is its ""simple"" presentation of the Gospel, but I couldn't help but wish that this story had been carried out in a more engaging manner. Girzone does far too much ""telling"" and far too little ""showing,"" which is a cardinal sin in writing. Yes, it was faith-affirming, but I could not help but feel, upon finishing it, that I was missing something."
2,CONFUSING,"Joshua is a book that helped me tu remember the simplicity of life, but on the other hand it confused me a lot about the concepts of my religion. So, while it gave me a little light, it also gave me a lot of dark. So far I will not recommend the book to anybody."
1,Jesus please save us from this CRAP!,"HORRIBLE. It really, really was horrible. One of the worst books I've ever read. This author must be mentally retarded or something because this is one of the worst, unimaginative and just stupid plots ever written. It looks as if a first grader wrote this, the dialouge and writing is so incredibly simplistic you could fall asleep while reading it. You would definatly have a better time asleep then reading this. Boring, stupid, horrible writing, completly false information, predictable characters... its a complete waste."
2,Joshua,"""Joshua"" is a very inspiring book about a man who epitomizes the traits and character of Jesus. In fact, the reader will probably infer after reading a few pages, that the author's intent is to show Jesus and how he would act and react to the many situations developed in a very insightful way by Girzone. It is, in a way, a mystery which keeps the reader spell-bound until the last page. I highly recommend this book to anyone.J. Bollinger"
3,faith and religion,"The novel, Joshua adds a new demension of understanding to the spiritual aspect of religion. Joshua, the main character closely resembles the biblical figure, Jesus. Joshua is just an implied allusion to Jesus and is constently alluding to the life and teachings of Jesus. This book makes a true connection with the actual meaning of faith and religion that Jesus tried to bring about by example. Joshua forces one to think about the state of religion and the impact that it makes upon people. Joshua also forces those that use religion as a means of power to become uneasy in their deivation from Jesus' origional words. In this book Joshua brings about many prevlant questions about organized religion that are answered only through his simplistic and adimate faith"
5,quiet way to make sense of it all,"I read this book years ago when I was in Catholic high school and at the time I didn't fully understand it. Recently, I came across this book and thought it would be a good read.The story of Joshua is a wonderful parable about the life of Jesus and how easy it can be for good people to lose track of the meaning of His life, His teachings, and why He died for us. It's easy to be overwhelmed by ""religious"" people who are closely adhering to rules and regulations. But this book teaches you the true spirit of Jesus... and is an awakening about our current society.As I read this book, I'm often brought to tears... it's a book that I have recommended to many.For anyone who has questioned religion and his/her part of it, and for those who think they know it all, this is a ""MUST READ""."
2,This book poses no questions and offers no answers,"I recently met a man at a funeral and we were discussing the uninspiring eulogy for the dearly departed delivered by the minister. I told him how unhappy I was with organized religion -- not God, but the churches and people who represented him. He suggested I read ""Joshua"". Although it was refreshing to find that someone else shared my opinion of ""churches"", I did not have the life-changing experience that other readers have had.My criticisms include 1) the book seemed to be written for a young adult reader -- it was too simple. 2) it posed no questions for me -- just affirmed what I already felt. 3) it answered no questions for me. 4) the symbolism was spelt out too clearly -- I wanted to find it on my own.""Joshua"" is a nice parable, but hardly worth the time."
5,I grieved when I finished the book.,"Joshua was a pure pleasure, from beginning to end. Owning a Christian bookstore myself, I come in contact with many, many books, and have little time to read them. But I looked forward to spending time reading Joshua in the evening before retiring. But when I finished it, it left quite a void. I missed this man! What a powerful movie Joshua would make. Any ideas for the lead? I have a few thoughts."
2,Not my idea of good reading.,"This book offers an interesting supposition: that a Christ-like person appears on earth,in an ordinary neighborhood and begins a swift journey to the Vatican. He is a simple, intelligent man with a message, but is not recognized for his godliness by most of the people he encouters. It is a fairly written book, but did not appeal to me. There are better books about religion, if you want that. If you just want an interesting read, it's OK, but very simple, almost childlike."
2,am I the only one to find this a dull read?,"Poorly written, I had to plow through the book which I promised to read for someone. A 4th grader could have done better. No development of characters, totally predictable and how can they make this into a movie is beyond me.If you have nothing better to do, then waste your time."
4,Joshua,"This lovely book describes God and religion in a simple and melodic style. Joshua is a wonderful example of God's message of love. It also makes you wonder, ""If Jesus was in our midst today - would we recognize him?""Father Girzone does a wonderful job of emphasizing there isn't just one ""right"" religion. He reinforces that God's love and loving God transends all boundaries and limitations."
2,Mediocre Western Made Worse By Bad Music Score,"As much as I love westerns and like Robert Mitchum in almost everything this was a disappointment for me. It's not terrible, it's just not very good! A totally inappropriate (for a western) music score by Jazzman Shelly Manne doesn't help! It might be worth a look on Turner Classic Movies or MGM HD but I seriously doubt even devout western or Mitchum fans would want to sit though this thing more than once."
3,"A great song, but a waste of a CD","Da Draussen is the second most recent song from Fettes Brot as I write this review (Schwule Maedchen being the most recent). Considering that Fettes Brot has been around in the German hiphop scene for quite a while, it's nice to know they're still making good music. The song itself is really good. It has a great beat and the lyrics (once translated to english for those who don't speak german) really tell a story. However, the remixes aren't really what I would consider ""remixes"", that is, reworkings of a song. The remixes included are just new beats under the same raps, not changed at all. And I don't even like all of them. The Fuddn 1000 remix in particular I dislike. If you want to hear good music from Fettes Brot, including Da Draussen, buy their album ""Fettes Brot Fuer die Welt"" ..."
4,Classic American lit!,"Very enjoyable read! I never read them in high school, but got inspired after visiting the Pocono Mountains and reading about the Delaware Indians. Cooper's stories are a classic insight into American life in the 18th century, and American ideas in the 19th. My only complaint - Cooper and Hawkeye are so verbose!"
3,Starts off well,"The book has a good, crisp start. You're immediately drawn into the characters, their lives, and their personality quirks. However about half way through the book it seems to devolve into a Hollywood caper. You get the feeling that this book was written so it could be turned into a movie with Bruce Willis, John Travolta, and Joe Pesci in the leads.On the up side, Coupland provides his usual insightful broad-ranging commentaries about relationships, family, politics, and media.All in all, it's more readable than Generation X but doesn't hit the mark like Microserfs. And it's still better than 98% of the recent junk out there."
2,satirized to death,"It's sad really. I mean, you use to be able to read Coupland and get to the thoughtful heart of things pretty quick. The irony and sarcasm were always there, but they didn't overpower, totally overwhelm the story. But now, with a book like this, I really feel like I'm being satirized to death, and if there's a soul hidden away somewhere in this new writing style of his, well, I can't for the life of me find it. CONCLUSION: incredibly crafty but largely unsatisfying stuff, sort of like the literary equivalent of junk food, except it costs 30 bucks a pop. I remember reading an article about Douglas years ago, just after he published generation X. Apparently, at the time, he was planning to write a book on the potatoe famine. That all-important lost novel now more than ever before, I think, must to be written."
4,Funny!,I really did enjoy this book. His writting reminds me of Carl Hiaasen. I am looking forward to reading more of Copeland's books.
2,Do Douglas Coupland a favor and read one of this other books,"One reviewer called ""All Families Are Psychotic"" Coupland's second worst book, after ""Girlfriend in a Coma."" I have to disagree! I think ""All Families Are Psychotic"" is Coupland's worst effort to date.Although the book has many of the zeitgeist-y little touches (the family matriarch who chats online as HotAsianTeen, for example) that make Douglas Coupland stand out from the pack, it's a downer, a mean ego trip. The characters are indeed psychotic but that doesn't necessarily make them interesting!I have to wonder if Coupland, a Canadian, was briefly considering the title ""All Americans are Psychotic."" It seems to be one of the big themes in his oeuvre. Heh heh. So, I do not recommend this book. Sorry. Douglas Coupland is still one of my favorite writers and I do suggest that you read one of his other books!"
4,Excellently crafted story,All the best of Coupland is wrapped up here in this story. All the things that we fans love about his work is here. Great narrative line that keeps you involved all the way to the end! LOVED IT
3,Huh?,"I have been a fan of Coupland since the very beginning and have delighted as each book of his that I read has been better than the last. However, after reading this one I feel like I have run into a brick wall. Without a doubt the characters in this book are his best yet but the outlandish antics one family finds itself in are to me just too much to swallow. Everyone in this family is sick be it with HIV, cancer or birth defects. These sicknesses cast a rather gloomy shadow over the whole book. Set in Florida, the Drummonds are in town to see sister Sarah blast off into space. What ensues is a bumpy, jumpy prescription filled ride though one of the most far fetched plots ever. In my opinion this book is for established Coupland fans only, not a starting point for someone just beginning to read his work."
2,"Hopefully, he's reached the valley","Is it just me, or has Coupland gotten worse with every effort since <u>Microserfs</u>?In this latest effort, one can't help but wonder if the phenomenon that was Douglas Coupland has reached an ending. For the genesis of AFAP, I am picturing a half-dozen Hollywood screenwriters telling Coupland, ""We want something that we can make into a movie two years down the road. We're thinking a little bit of Cannonball Run meets Space Camp, starring a slightly more self-aware version of The Bundys or The Simpsons"". Doug takes this info, wraps it up and places it in Florida (time to start giving your readers a little credit, Doug - we realize your obsession with pre-packaged culture).What the readers wind up with is a blundering story, paced like a Hollywood comedy, slightly episodic, slightly framed, full of blundering madcap capers. From someone once touted as a voice of my generation, I expect more."
4,Fascinating chronicle of womens' history/Victorian mores,"This book is a compendium of the experiences of 19th century women who spent much of their lives on board sailing ships. Largely invisible in naval chronicles, a not inconsiderable number of wives and daughters accompanied merchant captains of that time. These globe-hopping women and girls led highly unconventional lives. They faced everything from abject boredom to dire peril from pirates, mutineers and the loss of loved ones from illness and injury - yet managed to overcome almost every challenge.The book is organized into broad categories of experience, and uses the womens' own words from letters and diaries to tell their stories. There are lots of thumbnail illustrations of shipboard life, too. All in all this is a fascinating peek at Victorian conventionality and how far women could go in stretching it while remaining firmly trussed within its bounds."
4,I liked it.,I would recomend this book for anyone to read. James is a great character to follow. His struggle with his faith is well done. Nicholas makes it clear what he wants the reader to get out of the Fist of God. God doesn't turn His back on anyone. I enjoyed the book very much.
2,Nicholas's first book,"It is obvious that this was his first novel,so I am being generous in giving this book 2 stars. It took me 1 month to read this very short book. I hate to say it, but it kept putting me to sleep. Which is kind of good because it is hard for me to fall asleep at nights."
2,Uninspired,"This book was full of amateur photos of dachshunds, nearly all posed the same way which made me think the author read a blog on pet photography and set out with her Canon Rebel for an afternoon of fun. Pass on this book, there are many with better photos and wiener dogs."
2,Cute but...,Cute pictures for the dachshund lover. I would have given this book 5 stars except half the pages are bound upside down. Not going to bother to exchange or return since it was such a low price.
2,Outdated and Missing Fundamentals,"The book is not up to date with the latest Twisted release. Unfortunately, the changes in the new framework are material and the book is a little misleading.In addition, the Twisted framework is a different paradigm but the book does a poor job of explaining how things work and how to get things working.It does have some good examples of things that are really powerful in Twisted."
5,Great Kanji Dictionary,"I had to buy this in High School for Japanese class, and I've loved it ever since. Once you get used to the indices, which are set up fantastically, you can find most kanji faster than an electronic dictionary. The amount of information provided, with stroke order, readings, archaic forms... is spectacular. I love this dictionary."
1,WALMART PRODUCT !!,This product has no mention of brand (West Point Stevens) or the product name (Rockport) on the package..They are just selling this under a fancy name !!THE PACKAGE SAYS MARKETED BY WALMART ON THE PACKAGING !!That speaks for its quality !!
4,Great knives,"These are fantastic knives. They are very sharp for being dishwasher safe and with a serrated edge, I'm not worried about having to re-sharpen them. Even with about 20+ runs through the dishwasher now, these are as sharp as the day we got them. While not the most stylish knives (plastic handles) they are incredibly functional and great to have for day-to-day use."
4,"not bad, but not recommended generally","This book helps your training with great pictures. But I would not recommend it for buying because it will lead you to bodybuilding philosophy of training peripheral muscles, which lead to injuries and deformities. The narcissism in bodybuilding is in my humble opinion wrong, and this book would lead you towards bad aims. So, you better buy book ""Essentials of Weightlifting & Strength training"" by Mr. Mohamed El-Hewie to get the real grasp of health and weightlifting."
5,Old edition,"The first edition of this book (ISBN# 0736041850) was replaced in December of 2005 by a new edition (ISBN# 0736063684) which includes a number of enhancements, including information on injuries common to strength trainers/weight lifters.Amazon has taken to periodically substituting the old edition for the new one in their sales rankings.Both editions rate 5 stars, but the current edition is the one you want."
1,first time I see a blu ray with no captions,"Really disappointed that this disc does not have even English captions, the quality of movies is also terrible and one of them only have 2.1 audio"
4,For the most part...,"Parts 1 and 2 were great!! Part 3 did not give me much. I did not like climax of the story or how it ended. It seemed as if they couldnt find anything better to write. They should have stopped while they were ahead.Part 1 involved the two brothers. While they were both horrible, one was dillusional and perverted. In the end, the older brother showed that he did have a speck of decency.Part 2 involved the bank robbers. Most of them became vampires, but one of them refused to give in. It was full of action, and I even laughed at some parts.Part 3 went way back into the cowboy days. It just seemed thrown together. I was confused at a lot of it, and the part where the guy goes into this little interlude at the bar, was the worst. I was not impressed."
4,It was an excellent gift for a future log home builder.,"I bought this book for my parents because they recently bought land to build a log house. There were many books to choose from but this one was definitely a hit with them. It has great pictures and excellent blueprint type plans. Even if you don't do exactly what the book says, it's a wonderful resource for general ideas. A superb gift for any present or future log home owners."
4,It will keep you interested,"Does anyone read Robbi Sommers for the plot or content of her books? Erotica is what Sommers is about. If that's what you want, this is the book. Any of her books are the book."
5,Nitty Gritty Grammar,"A bible fills my spiritual being, an asortment of cookbooks takes care of my physical self, and my dogearred ""Nitty, Gritty, Grammar is an essentil tool for keeping my social and creative skills sharp and perfected. This tool is essentil for preserving our English language . Helen M. Parsons"
5,More Nitty-Gritty Grammar,"What could be better than Nitty-Gritty Grammar? More Nitty-Gritty Grammar. There is more detail and there are longer explanations - perfect for the Administrative Assistant entrusted with ""cleaning up"" the boss's letters. It is an essential companion for anyone writing business letters."
4,Would recommend,"I picked this item out of an ""award"" catalog. I have had it about one month. I took it up to northern Ontario with me on a fishing trip. It worked very well at the cabin. The combo alarm, date and weather was a real convience when you have no electricity.So far, all is good, no problems. The only drawback I found was that when we woke up in the morning and saw it was 50 degrees outside and 56 degrees in the cabin, we stayed in bed, instead of going out on the lake fishing!"
3,I wish the blue backlight would stay lit,"The product works fine, however the blue backlight reflected in the picture isn't the way this clock looks unless you push a button at the top. Otherwise the clock and information on the clock cannot be seen, as it's far too dark. They should have made this with at least an adjustable backlight setting.I purchased this for our master mathroom for its looks and in the hopes it would serve to keep us on time, however we rarely even notice the clock, because we can't see what time it is unless we reach over and push the button. It takes me just as much time to simply walk back into my bedroom to check the well lit clock on my nightstand.Would I recommend this product? Probably not due to this specific issue. Otherwise it is an atomic clock, does have a sensor to reflect room temperature etc...however it doesn't meet my personal basic need to actually see the time."
4,"Nice, for the price","This is an easy-to-assemble, easy-to-use weather station. I got it to prove to my husband that is is colder in our bedroom than it is in the rest of the house, and the outdoor thermometer thingy was an added attraction. I put batteries (not included - need two sizes - AA and AAA) in and voila! The little tugger worked! Easy to set, too. Just don't expect to use it in the middle of the night - the night light feature is weak and only lasts a couple of seconds. A great daylight weather station. Also, I didn't - or it didn't - find the atomic clock, but that didn't matter much to me."
2,TIRESOME TRIPE,"SURROGATE CHILD unfolds with the suicide death of young Solomon Stern. His grieving parents in an effort to add more meaning to their lives take in a foster child named Jonathan. And lo and behold, seems like this new youngster is uncannily like their dearly departed Solomon.Joe and Martha Stern, the parents, are annoying from start to finish. He's a typical macho man, unwilling to admit his failure in relationship with his dead son; she's a whiny, overly pushy mother, whose love for Solomon is questionably incestuous. Of course, Jonathan comes in, wins over Solomon's girlfriend, friends and everyone but Joe.There's hardly any real suspense or chills in this book and Neiderman pads it with redundant speeches, and a ridiculous anticlimactic ending.I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Neiderman's other books, but this is one I do not recommend."
5,grandkids love it,"I had this when my kids were small, we danced to it nearly every day. Now we dance with the grandkids, they love it too, and don't realize they are exercising. I've recommended it to all the nieces and nephews with their own little ones."
1,Aural Child Abuse,"I was subjected to this drivel as a child. What a terrible way to treat the life's work of some of the greatest minds in history. I can only hope that my music will outlive me in such a visible way that future money-grubbing Clark-like Philistines will see profit in destroying the artistic context of my life's work. If I were a disgustingly rich man (which, as a musician I shan't ever be), I'd buy up a million copies of this schlock and damage the ozone with their collective molten fumes.Rrr!"
2,"Great music, all messed up on the CD","This music is, needless to say, brilliant...But to mix up the HOT CLUB recordings with Grappelli with those featuring Hubert Rostaign without data on performers, dates etc... Unbelievable!To add an insult to injury, I recognized at least one Reinhardt track not remotely related to ""Le hot club de France""; I think it's available in one of his CD's ""with American friends""...Every track is fantastic but, due to these problems, it's good only for listening in a car or as a background music to a sophisticated party. Serious jazz requires serious packaging..."
5,Workout!,This shirt is fantastic for working out in. It keeps me cool when I run and bike in the summer. It has great movement and feel for when I am doing my rounds on the circuit. I highly recommend for those who like to look and feel good when they workout.
2,"A fun idea, poorly written...","The premise of this series is fun-- a group of servants are behind their employer's success. Unfortunately the writing is very poor. Language is repetitive, even within paragraphs, and the author makes zero effort to use historically accurate language or incorporate norms of social behavior of the day (the only ""historical"" details I saw were relying on fires for heat and horses for transport). The characters all speak in 2006 English-- the only nod to Victorian language seems to be use of the terms ""lass"" and ""lad"". The dialogue just wasn't very well done. It was odd-- the book had many, many typos and obvious editing problems, too-- just seemed thrown together in a short time vs. well-written and well-produced.I was disappointed-- this book could have been so much better."
4,Awesome price for cups!,You can't beat the price. My only complaint is that the screw feet extend 1/4 inch so the pull is not flush with the cabinet all the way around. I installed them anyway without altering the hardware or the cabinet and they ook fine. I'd buy them again.
5,Gorgeous pulls,"These pulls were very pretty and heavy and well worth the money,however; I did not use the 7 I ordered because with the design cut on my cabinets the pulls did not look just right. I ordered 7 other Amerock handles that cost me 3 times the price of these. If your cabinets do not have a cut design, these pulls are gorgeous. The price on these handles is cheap for what you get in these pulls."
1,Why bother even making this book?,"The ONLY information that this book has, is a list of celebrities' birthdays. Such paltry information can be obtained with a simple search of the internet. I wouldn't buy a book with this information. But if you like celebrities that much, and don't feel like typing their name on a search engine to find out their birthday, then purchase this book and leaf though the pages to find your celebrity instead."
4,"Great Ice shaver, but you can have a problem",It is compact and works good. Very important that it shaves ice very fast and makes soft snow without pieces of ise.But you can have a problem with reliability using the machine hard. Be careful!!!
2,Bah Humbug!,"I bought this Christmas Special when it was first releasedon VHS, just in time for the holidays. It was a present formy brother, who is as sincere a fan of the show as I am.Although the compilation did bring back great memories ofThe Wonder Year's Christmas, I was kind of hoping for morecontent. The episodes (2 Christmas specials) were great!But if you are looking for a 'Best of' or full seasons,then you are probably better off waiting. This DVD only gotwatched ONCE by my brother. If you are looking for a goodChristmas gift, this one won't hold up under the tree."
5,Great Compilation of True Stories,"One of the best aspects of this book is the fact that it is a compilation of stories written by the survivors themselves or told to others in the first person. It offers insight into the Indians' lives and customs and also provides depth to the struggle the settlers went through just to move further westward. I used this book as part of my research for one of my upcoming historical books, and I found it to be very educational. There are some scenes that continue to fill my mind with terror long after I put the book down. It gives one an appreciation for those who settled this country two hundred and fifty years ago."
2,Very interesting--extremely graphic,"This one left me short of breath. The book consists of true stories of settlers captured by the Indians, but the brutality was just TOO much for me. Each story starts out fairly pleasant, moves towards the sickening part...and the end, is only for sadists-and I am not one- due to the content, I don't recommend this one.This book is certainly not the one you sit in an easy chair and read."
4,Great read!,"I concur with most of the reviews below. These accounts are interesting & varied, both from timescale & geography of captures. I often felt myself brought into the sufferings of the unfortunates concerned. Suffering being the overriding theme of the book. Whilst some captives eventually receive more decent treatment & even adoption into the tribe, all have to deal with initial ill-treatment & most, a series of torture, deprivation & cruelty. Not sure whether this is a tribute to the author, or the original story-teller, but the accounts are direct, unfussy & immediate. This is a great way to find out more about the Native American psyche & it's also a great read!"
5,MARRIAGE BINDING,THIS MOVIE WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HAPPENS TO COUPLES OVER TIME IN A MARRIAGE (TAKING ONE ANOTHER 4 GRANTED & NOT LOOKING AT THINGS THRU THE OTHER'S EYE). BUY THIS MOVIE.
5,Much better than expected!,"I would give Fireproof ***** 5 starts for its fireproof way of teaching me how to make my marriage fireproof!. It would have been nice though, if they would have described all of the tips on how to make a marriage fireproof, from day 1 to day 43, they only mentioned a few of them. Regardless, still giving it 5 stars. I have followed the fireproof tips and hence my marriage is now fire proof. I especially like the tip that said to have sex everyday."
1,complete hype,The acting in this movie was extremely poor and it felt like I was watching a high school play. And please let's not discuss the fake southern accents. It definately did not live up to the hype.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I felt nothing for either the wife or the husband - both characters were very immature.
5,Great movie for couples to see,"The movie FIREPROOF was a great movie. It lived up to all that I heard about it. While the story was developed well, the message behind the story was excellent. I recommend it to anyone - especially if you are married. Watch it with your spouse. After I watch it with my husband, I gave it to my son to watch with his wife. Excellent for a church group or club to show also."
4,powerful message,This is a powerful message on how to treat your spouse and how to have a successful married life.
4,Wise counsel,"The movie Fireproof may not be what you expect, but this is a movie which can really make a difference in your life. Looking at the box you might expect an action film like ""Backdraft"", but that is not what you will get. What you will find is wise Christian counselling about how to make your marriage loving and joyful and long-lasting. It starts out looking like amateurish acting, but gets better and better, so stick with it. Be sure to watch all the special features too."
4,positive and inspiring,Great movie. It shows how we can get caught up in our lives and ourselves and forget about those around us who are important to us. It will inspire you to do better.
2,Kirk Cameron is great,"Too bad the rest of the movie was not...typical marriage problems potraying the male as the fire-breathing bad guy who does all the work and spends money to make the female happy and to keep her pants zipped lol, laughable."
3,Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!,"I see that a few folks have given very angry negative reviews because of this pic's Christian perspective, but their emotional reaction misses the point entirely. The film is not trying to convert anyone, it's simply trying to show that even a badly damaged marriage can be redeemed, and is worth redeeming.OK, not as glossy as we've come to expect from the studios - the acting is, for the most part, pretty poor, and the dialog is stilted. But - take it from someone who has been there - I've never seen a movie that better depicted the hurt, frustration, and hopelessness of a failing marriage, and what can be accomplished if one makes the commitment to save it."
5,Great for people in a good relationship already too,My husband & I watched this movie and both cried toward the end and he doesn't cry. It really works if you care to do what it says.
3,B-,"I found the message touching. Not too many movies have a moral let alone a Christian message. I didn't think the acting was all terrible. I actually thought Kirk did a decent job. Some of the others though, well they just did OK, about as good as your local school play. The lack of quality acting wasn't overly detrimental to the story line. The comedic moments I thought were over the top. Goofy more than funny. My wife and I did laugh quite hard at some of the scenes together. Many I don't think our response was what the makers intended. Its not a great movie but the message is good and other than being a little slow, and some not so good acting it was still enjoyable. Its a movie with a Christian message. You anti-Christians need to relax. You don't have to watch it, and I truly doubt anyone on the planet doesn't know about its Christian content."
5,Refreshing,"A very refreshing movie. Too many movies are coming out that are full of sex references or scenes. We need more movies like this to show our kids that all that trash can actually damage your marriage. Do men think that it makes women feel good to see them staring and fantasizing about other women? Then they wonder why the woman in their life doesn't really want anything to do with them. This movie really brings that to light and shows that a man can avoid the trash and find what he needs with his spouse. It also shows that a women can and will forgive if his apology comes from the heart so she can once again find what she needs in her husband. It's a wonderful journey that makes you appreciate your spouse and helps you to realize that you shouldn't take each other for granted. It reinforces the fact that a marriage can overcome any obstacle if both people are willing to put forth the effort with love, respect, forgiveness, and support."
1,Mixed Messages,"This movie demonstrates that the guy wasn't accepted by the female until she found out he paid over $20,000. That is a poor message to be sending to women and men alike. In God's eyes both the female and male are cheaters. While neither of them physically cheated on each other, he cheated with porn, and she cheated with the doctor. He overcame his sin but she was paid to leave hers. While I believe an honest attempt was made to make a good movie, the story line got sucked into today's mainstream thinking. What a pity."
5,Moving and inspiring,"We first watched this movie at a couple's workshop. This is not a movie about converting to Christianity, it is about a man saving a damaged and seemingly irreparable marriage. The movie had a budget of 500K when most Hollywood movies spend millions on technical effects. Giving the movie a bad review for special effects, Really! The most important part of any movie is the story and this is a great story. Strong recommendation!"
3,Is marital success reserved for Christians?,"I watched this film primarily to see if I could recommend it to my own son. It was very affecting until the point where the father tells his son that the only way to succeed in his efforts was to become ""saved.""I knew it was a Christian film. Although I am not Christian, I have always believed in taking wisdom wherever I found it, as long as it didn't contradict my own beliefs. To say that marital success depends on being Christian, goes over the line, and deprives others -- Jews, Muslims, non-believers -- of the opportunities presented by this otherwise excellent program."
5,Fireproof DVD,"Great movie; very positive & encouraging for marriage - would recommend it to everyone!However, Amazon took seemingly forever to get it to me. I mean, really, more than a week??? This is the worst service I've ever received from Amazon!"
1,"Soft Porn for wives (with ""Christian package"").","Is your husband a man? Is he selfish and want to have sex frequently? Buy him this DVD and a copy of the ""Love Dare"" and beat him around the ears with it until he realizes what a total loser he is and learns to bow in the face of your superior womanhood. Cry and give your husband pleading looks as you force him to watch it, giving him a guilt trip for not conforming to the airbrushed perfection of the transformed Caleb. Ask, ""Why can't you be like him?"" and ""Why don't you destroy your computer?""Maybe you shouldn't mind when we whip out the latest offering by Hugh Hefner and ask ""Why can't you be like her?"".Or not."
1,What kind of garbage is this?,I really wouldnt even give this movie a star if it was possible. The previews on other movies made this film look good but 18 minutes into it and I am shutting it off. The acting is a joke. It is annoying to see the way these actors look as if they are reading the script as they go. It is emotion is off from what the script is say as well. Its really a waste of time and money. Thankfully I reneted this movie from the library and it was free.
5,"Awesome movie, really put what is important in perspective",See this movie! It's a good reminder to what's really important. Will make you look at your spouse in a new way.
5,Awesome movie,"This is an incredible movie that is recommended to any couple, whether married or just dating. It had a tremendous positive impact on my marriage and reminded us how important it is to not take one another for granted and to keep Christ in our marriage at the forefront."
5,Great movie,Everyone told me the movie was great and it was. I Loved it!It was reasonably priced and shipped quickly! Thanks!
4,Scorching Review,Fireproof had an amazing story line. My husband and I love the book as well. At times the acting is a little obvious but it's a great movie if you look beyond that.
5,Buy It! Watch It! Learn From It!,Just want to put my two cents worth in and say that this movie hit home and I could relate to it! It was very touching and I don't see films made like this too often! I highly recommend it for the whole family.
3,review of fireproof,"A sad but true fact about divorce is once the process is over, most people say that if they had known earlier how painful the whole process would be they would've tried harder to save their marriage in the first place. The movie fireproof is a riveting love movie that'll make you cry. One couple's marriage is going downhill it's the story about the journey of saving a couples marriage and becoming close again with your significant other. I would definitely recommend this movie to any girl that loves romance and a good cry. And maybe even a couple that has been having marriage problems. It may even inspire them to work things out. It definitely grabbed my attention on how painful divorce can be and makes me never want to have to deal with that. This is a great movie because it has a great lesion and makes you realize how important someone is to you."
5,Refreshing viewpoint of marriage,"With many of today's movies portraying and glorifying adultery and divorce, this movie is a breath of fresh air. It is about a fireman whose marriage is about to end in divorce. He treats his wife coldly and selfishly, traits that his wife also exhibits towards him. Just as he is about to resort to a divorce, the young man's father offers help in the form of ""The Love Dare"", a 40-day program for restoring struggling marriages. At first he is reluctant, but eventually he finds new faith in the Lord and his wife begins to realize that he is a changed man. Besides Kirk Cameron in the lead role, most of the other actors are amateurs and they do an amazing job. The movie has its comic relief, such as the young couple's laconic next-door neighbors, and is overall the most polished effort to date from its producers. This movie is not just meant for entertainment, but is very instructive about how people should live their lives and conduct their marriages."
4,Something Changed In Me,"I purchased this dvd on the advice of a friend. I am a believer and my husband is currently not. While the movie itself seems to simplify the trials of real life, after watching it, I myself began to hope in the reality of such a life. I was inspired to believe that happy endings are possible. At the very least, you'll walk away from watching this movie, with that ""feel good"" feeling. It may however, inspire you to believe that things can be better between you and your spouse and to work toward that goal."
3,Fireproof,"On the religious side... this movie starting Growing Pains star, Kurt Cameron was good. If your marriage could use a tune up... watching this movie together might be worth your time. I plan to pass it on to women that say they are having marriage issues."
5,Fireproof and entertaining.,"I am a huge Kirk Cameron fan. When I came across ""Fireproof"" on ""Amazon"", I readthe descriptions and knew I had to have it. This is a movie about forgiveness,priorities, and love. This is a great movie to watch all by yourself, or as afriends or family movie night, flick. Does your marriage need an emotional boost?Fireproof may be just what the doctor ordered."
1,FireProof,I never recieved the item that i order. This is the first time in years this has happen to me.
4,fire proof,The contain it is wonderful. It helps husband and wife to be patience and understand each other more.
2,Wanted to like it but...,"The only message I took away from this movie was that Kirk's character wasno more than an appliance/ATM for his wife. Working a dangerous job andhandling a mortgage and two car payments wasn't enough to make him a ""good""man. What did she sacrifice after he paid her parent's expenses? What didshe give up? If marriage is about sharing, is it only the man's responsibility?"
1,Can you say bad......,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I felt like I was watching a high school drama production that wasn't very good. The acting was terrible, the general video footage etc was bad, it was just plain horrible all around. I wanted to see this at the theater but boy am I glad I didn't pay for that! I don't care about the messages or the religious undertones, the movie is just bad. I was raised in a fire station and come from a long line of firefighters and this movie was not even close to realistic. I actually found myself laughing outloud at how poorly some of the scenes were done. It was bad enough that I felt the need to write a review and I don't do that very often. I would say save your money, if you just have to watch this rent it first..."
5,Great movie for couples!,"This movie is very well done, very professional, funny, scarry, and sad, with a positive message to couples about how to preserve and enhance relationships. I highly recommend."
5,Fireproof,Great movie. Gave my wife and I a new perspective on our marraige. Nice to see a faith-based movie.
4,"Look at the message of the film, not just the forced dialogue...","Anyone who is overly critical of this film is just thinking that this movie is out to convert everyone to Christianity and that is so not the case. It's a beautiful story with a great message, not mention some romance minus the steamy hot sex that seems to be required in other romantic films. I like to think that even agnostic couple can be motivated to better their relationships through seeing this. I know it certainly motivated me, not to mention making me fall in love with Kirk Cameron all over again! :) The only part of this movie that made me uneasy was that some of the dialogue seemed forced and unnatural, like a skit you would put on at church camp in middle school. But that is easily overlooked."
4,Perfect for young child to learn on,"My 6 year old can't get his hands around the frets of a full size guitar, so this 3/4 size unit was perfect. When in tune, it sounds fine. Compared to my full size Yamaha, this guitar goes out of tune more frequently, probably because the hardware is a little cheap. However, I tune this sucker up with my cheap Koirg tuner in under a minute, and my son is making good progress in his guitar lessons on it. Like I said, when in tune it resonates nicely and sounds nice. It also has pegs at either end of the sound box for a strap, unlike my full size guitar that only has a peg at one end (?!). If you have kid with small hands embarking on guitar lessons, this is a great choice."
4,It's okay,"The unit is fine. I like that there is a phone, alarm and radio all in one so I don't have to have more than one thing on my bedside table. Two things have been slightly challenging. Working out how to set and turn off the alarm. I like the feature where I turn off the alarm and it automatically is set for the same time tomorrow. I don't have to worry about not setting my alarm at night. Dispite the fact that the display has 3 brightness settings, the lowest one is still a little bright for me. That's probably personal preference. We live in the country so at night we are used to it being totally dark. Someone in the city probably wouldn't even notice. Overall, I'm glad I bought this unit."
3,Nahhhhhh!,"This phone is okay. Way to small, and a real pain. The alarm clock is brighter than the Sun and louder than a horn. Makes my eyes hurt just being in the same room as it. It may look cute... but its very naughty."
3,Too Bright an idea!,"I bought a GE 2.4 GHz 27980GE3 Cordless Bedroom Phone with AM/FM Stereo and Call Waiting Caller ID. I received it before Christmas and gave it to my wife as a Christmas present. She was delighted, as we needed a new phone and Clock Radio for the bedroom. It wasn't until she plugged it in, read the instruction book and slept with it (next to the bed) the first night that she was less then enamored with the product. Even with the display set to the lowest setting, the clock display lights up the bedroom like a search light. She has resorted to covering the display with a towel so that the light does not disturb her sleep, which defeats the purpose of having a clock radio next to the bed in the first place. She is sending it back."
2,Doesn't last more than a year,Worked fine when we first got it although radio has poor reception as others reported. After about a year one of the display LEDs must have burned out since I was no longer able to set the screen on bright. Next the buttons that turn on/off the 2 alarms started to act flakey -- would need to press them multiple times to get any activity. I'm trying to get a replacement but there doesn't seem to be much choice except GE.
1,Still waiting.....,"I ordered this phone on Oct. 16-today is Nov. 12 and the item has still not shipped. It did not state in the ordering process that item would not ship out until mid- Nov to early December. I called Amazon, who in turned contacted the manufactor, however, this did not expediate the order."
4,Purchase Review,I purchased this product to replace two existing devices (clock radio & cordless phone). It is compact and looks good. It has many functions which are easy to use. The sound / speakers could be better quality but are adequate. The price was not bad but made better with Amazon Visa offer ($30 discount). Online purchase was easy and shipping was no problem.
3,back light TO bright,I like the compactness of the phone and clock radio however the back light lights the room even with it set at its lowest setting just illuminating the numbers would be enough. Have to put a pillow over it to cut the light it gives off while sleeping.
5,Love my heartland series,can't wait for the 10 series to come out to us in the USA in September. It is family oriented and suspenseful at the same time. The beauty surrounding each scene is breath taking. Makes me want a horse !
3,"Great Distance, Terrible Base.","I actually bought these for the batteries. We already had a set (4 phones).We got an Amazon Card, and with bonus it was Free.We like the phones because of the Caller ID on the hand sets, and the distance we can go.The base station is a pain to program. We live in an area with Dirty Power and light flicker's cause the Base to loose messages that mysteriously come back days later. We constantly have to 'reprogram' date and time. It takes forever. 1..AM, 2..AM,3..AM,... 01,02,03... and re sync the external handsets.I have discovered, though, if I come home and it's all screwed up, all I (most times) have to do is unplug the base for 10 seconds, and plug it back in and everything comes back to normal. (Most Times).Cheers,BuBu"
1,The sizing is way way off!,"I hated to send these beautiful boots back, but they were for my size 11 partner and he could not get them on. I am a 9.5 and they sort of fit me (tight up front, loose in back). Maybe the label was wrong?"
5,The name says it all!,"I really liked this movie, more than I thought I would. The commentary had a lot of extra insight in to the making of the movie. I would recommend this to film students and people that just want a good entertaining doc."
2,Missing Pages,"Great book, too bad about the 20 missing pages. Who sells reference books with missing pages? Not a good seller, steer clear of these guys."
1,Nonsense for the credulous,"Readers who have taken Bjerknes's claims seriously should be aware that he wrote the following nonsense about Einstein that is fully in accord with the views of the neo-Nazi Stormfront.org:""The political Zionists, Albert Einstein chief racist among them, embraced the myth that anti-Semitism is the salvation of the 'Jewish race', in that it forces Jews to segregate against their will and better natures. Einstein hated non-racist Jews, though he himself had married a non-Jew... Jewish racists helped to put Hitler into power in order to herd up the Jews of Europe and force them into segregation.""[...]John Stachel, Professor Emeritus at the Center for Einstein Studies, Boston Universityhas a devastating review of Bjerknes's book [...]"
4,Good overall,"Good basic one-sided origami paper with a nice selection of traditional patterns. Not as good as the Japanese paper, but perfectly fine for kids."
5,"Good Quality, Easy to fold!","This paper pack is by Tuttle again and is of a real good quality. It is easy to fold, too. One can fold pretty Kusudamas with this paper and other Modular pieces. At least that's what I have used this particulr paper pack for. This again, as with most Tuttle origami paper packs, comes in 48 colors of patterned origami paper, single - sided. One gold foil sheet is also included in addition to this."
2,A nadir in selenography,"Wilkins was perhaps the worst draughtsman to ever attempt a visual lunar atlas. Basing his attempt on Walter Goodacre's earlier privately printed map (as well as that of Neison), Wilkins filled in every possible blank space with lines. Detail is so crammed in that the map is useless and always was. It is also inaccurate. It's too bad that an endeavor that began with Galileo, Hevelius and reached the pinnacle under Schmidt fell to such a low standard before visual selenography became virtually obsolete.Nonetheless the book is of interest to historians of lunar studies and the text expands that of Neison. The Goodacre map was published in very limited numbers and although reproduced in Hutchinson's ""Splendour of the Heavens"" was not really readily available and Wilkin's map at least preserved the pretense that selenography was alive, if not well.Worth getting for its historical interest."
2,Fighting techniques of a Japanese Infantry man,Left me with more questions than answers. Too few images for me to conceptualise what was being described in the book. A lot of text (In fact whole paragraphs) are repeated throughout. This book - in my opinion - is not a good introduction to the topic. Some sections were excellent - such as as that on hygiene.
5,Great product,"I love this sharpener! I have never been able to get as good an edge on my knife with a stone, this tool makes it easy to get my knife sharper than it has ever been before - great product, easy to use, worth the money."
2,meh..,"product works but is cheaply made. the guide broke the second time using. wont get you that ""shave the hair off your arm"" type sharpness that i wanted either."
5,The power of three will set them free.,"This book was a real good read! Three sisters discover they have magical powers, one can freeze time, another can see the future and one can move things with her mind. However they aren't just any witchies, they are the charmed ones the most powerful of all witchies! Their magic comes with a cost though, a warlock wants their powers and he'll get them even if it kills them. The plot was understanable and enjoyable, the charcters are very real even just in a book. This book shows you alot more about the characters then the TV show. I reccomend it to all Charmed fans."
5,Charmed: The best book and TV show in the world,"I absolutely love Charmed. Infact, I'm obsessed. If I miss a show, I go crazy. When its on, I have a wide smile on my face, and I keep saying, ""I love this show! Its so awesome!"" I wanted to know everything I could about Charmed, so I came here and I ended up buying every episode of the books! This one was great. I highly recomend this, along with all of the others. Its as if, Piper, Prue, and Phoebe came to life and I was living all of their adventures with them. This book is, by far, the best I have ever read!"
5,Great book,"I started to wach ""Charmed"" the TV show near the end of the first season, so these books allowed me to catch up in the beginning episodes. These books are great, and very descriptive. They tell the whole story very well, and they helped me understand things that happened in the later episodes. They're great!"
5,Charmed,"This is a great book. It is about Prue, Piper and Phoebe starting there adventures as witches. Pheobe, the youngest sister, said an incantation which started the series. These sisters have to fight thruogh evil demons as well as warlocks who are trying to steal there powers. This is the BEST book I have ever read!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointment (Kindle version),"If you have a Kindle, do not buy this book. I repeat: do not buy this book. I do not know what Amazon did this time, but it is full of flaws in spelling, organization and also in the continuity of pages. See, for instance, Locations 4082-89, that ends with the sentence ""whence his exhortation to the German people in his last-minute testament."" When you click next page, what appears? ""briefly in all kinds of Swedish positions."" It just does not make any sense at all.About the real content of the book, it is also disappointing. Lukacs states several times that his purpose is not deal with Hitler himself, but with his historians. In the first chapter he follows this objectives; then he forgets about the historians and starts to deal with Hitler as a biographer. Just lamentable."
2,Hitler vs. Stalin,"It's clear that Lukacs is propagating a conventional view of Hitler, without incorporating new revelations from Soviet Archives, and basing most of his analysis on previous Hitler biographies rather than ground-breaking research. This book impressed me as being merely a collection of opinions and counter-opinions. Lukacs' critique of David Irving is most interesting: Irving is now charging Lukacs with libel because of it, and it may be elucidating for any reader to see David Irving's responses to Lukacs, posted on the internet. Most striking is Lukacs' conventional comments on Soviet intentions regarding an offensive against Germany and Western Europe: He completely discounts that this could ever have been an intention, which in my opinion discredits this book's worth as scholarship, given that contemporary research into Soviet Archives has resulted in a hot debate on this matter. It would be instructive for the public to read another reputable opinion on this matter as well:"
3,"Poorly edited/assembled, but yet decent","Let me preface this recommendation by saying that it is one of the worst edited and poorly arranged books I've ever read. That said, it's sold more than 400,000 copies entirely through word of mouth to an audience that doesn't read a lot of books: addicts. My long running theory is that we are all addicts, and that the majority of our problems come from not understanding why we feel compelled to do things and our inability to evaluate our track record after engaging in those behaviors. This book looks at the seemingly innocuous events of our childhoods that turn out to have sweeping effects on our decision-making skills and our desires and aversions. She talks about boundaries, which I think are hugely undervalued. Strangely, the book is more about the things I just mentioned and about living a healthy life than it is about codependency."
2,fluff material,"If you accept the fact that there is an emerging water crisis, then WtRRD had very little more to offer. This is a superficial survey of examples of how fresh water is running short. Now, if this fact is news to you, then the book might be worth readiong. If you already know, then spend your money on something else. I had the impression that this book would be more about what will happen as the crisis continues to grow. WtRRD is long on sensationalism and short on science. I guess that's what happens when you read a book written by a journalist...Not recommended."
2,ignores soil surface,"Interesting book but it ignores the biggest factor in a functional water cycle: the condition of the soil surface. Plant and litter cover on the soil surface increases infiltration, slows runoff, and slows evaporation. The biggest issue with the water cycle around the world is bare ground. From reading this book, you would only realize that this is a problem in cities, with their impervious pavements."
3,When the citations run dry,"This book deals with a very important subject and describes the author's first person observations with passion in a very readable manner. However, the book suffers from several glaring flaws.First, almost every page has a discussion based upon at least one major statistic. Unfortunately, the source of none of these statistics is provided. There is no bibiliography, no footnotes or endnotes. A critical reader is given little help in following up on the issues raised. From a policy perspective, this book will not be helpful to anyone attempting to persuade non-believers.Second, the discussion eventually becomes repetitious. I don't mind that he is clearly extremely biased, but after a while the diatribes grow tedious, and detract from an otherwise impressive presentation.It is a real shame that such passion and effort should result in a book that doesn't share the sources of the research so that others can verify its contents and persuade others to take action."
4,!0 game set review,"With all the new great battle b-daman stuff out that people are all getting ecited about, what better way to start your game than to buy this awesome 10 game set to prepare you for future Hasbro tournaments? This game set comes with a game spinne to decide what event you play, which means you gotta be ready for everything !! !!It also comes packed with everything you need to play the games. 6 pins for games like shoot the gap and ultimate strike, and 6 marbles to play the games. Also, it comes with 4 flip gates that you use in games like b-daman assault. Then there are awesome barriers that increase the difficulty in some games, like DHB Havoc, and Hard Target.Every hasbro game can be played with this set, except DHB games, which you will have to purchase some of the DHB figures to play.So overall this product was a great buy for any one interedted in getting into the new hit, Battle B-Daman !! !!(...)"
1,sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,when i started to play the games they sucked and i thought b-daman is cool it is not .It is a waste of money.
4,The Messerschmitt Me 109 : 1936 to 1942 : (From the Prototyp,"The color profiles of various Me-109s ARE the book. Great for modelers, and Me-109 fans. Some French to English translation / editing flaws in the text.The main thrust of the book is the Me-109E, its various paint schemes, maintenance markings, wing and fighter group insignia, fusilage markings, kill markings, etc. The Me-109F2 is introduced in the final chapter, with 12 profiles of said aircraft provided.If you're looking for prewar / early war Me-109 color profiles, this book is ""more bang for your buck"" when compared to those in the Osprey Aircraft of the Aces Series."
4,Used for Legos,"We bought 2 of these for our 6 year old son. He has many legos and loves the little lego men the best. We use the detachable screw holders for lego men and this way my son can find them right away, no need to dig forever. We painted the outside with the themes of legos that are inside. he loves being able to find what he wants right away and I love that the legos are all in one place now!"
3,okay,"I don't like this game very much. I only like the multiplayer part of it, but unfortunately, my sister never wants to play it with me. So this game is not recommended for people who like playing alone."
4,Great for my Kid Sister,She loves this game and I find that she is willing to come back to it even after not playing for a while.
1,Poor production.,I am very disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting a movie not clips from the news media. It is a poorly done production and lacks quality. Generic for sure. You can hardly hear the narrator as the music over powers the voice. Where's the story line? I found it hard to follow and that it would not be a good witnessing tool. It would be very confusing to a non-believer. I've seen better productions by high school students. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD as I've seen other productions regarding the Alpha & Omega that gave a very clear message.
4,"Easy and Hard, brain benders and easy ones too","Lots of great colorful mazes for ages 3-13, good for all sorts of ""sit down and be quiet"" situations where kids need to be able to work alone without adult intervention. These are slightly easier than the first two volumes of the set, but just as much fun, just as attractive, just as intellectually challenging. Mazes are one the sure-fire ways to increase your kid's attention span (fie on ADD and ADHD excuses), impulse control, ability to carry a task to completion and (yikes) maybe even their intelligence! Best of all, nobody gives you a grade on these things!!!Most maze books are boring, black and white and either too easy or too hard. These are all in color, all are fun, all are challenging (but suitable for ages 3-13) Good for airplanes, sitting in airports, doctors offices, or even at church."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I bought this system from Sam's Club recently and the phones were pieces of junk. The reception within the house was shoddy at best, dialing was a debacle because the phones wouldn't recognize the dialing, and the caller id wouldn't show the number of the person dialing until after the phone had clicked to voicemail. It may be an attractive price, but just bite the bullet and pay $20 more for a system that actually works!"
1,Not worth even the low price,"My husband gave me this for a birthday gift because it had a slim profile when mounted on the wall. That is the only good thing about this phone system. I wish I had read reviews after I got it so it could have been returned. Where to begin? The backlight goes off after the second ring. Too bad because it takes more than two rings for it to register the caller ID so you can't see who's calling. There is no speaker phone ability. As other's have pointed out, you can only use one handset at a time. Worse yet, if you want to pick up an extension, the extension that answered the phone originally needs to use the call ""transfer"" feature to that handset before you can pick it up. Occasionally, the battery goes dead prematurely and with little notice because it would appear it hasn't charged well or properly. The volume feature is inconvenient to use. The programming features are not user friendly. I seem to find more to dislike every day."
2,Wish I had read the reviews,"I purchased this phone system around June 2006. One of the handsets has failed to work since purchasing the unit. I have contacted Vtech's support regarding the problem and none of their troubleshooting tips have resolved the issue. They have offered to replace the phone, but I'm completely disappointed that I have to pay for shipping the phone to them in order to get a replacement. Furthermore, what's a person to do for a phone if this the only one they have? Vtech needs to change it's product return procedures such that customers first receive a new phone along with a pre-paid return shipping label to return bad units. I really wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before buying this phone. If I had, I never would have bought it. Oh, and by the way, Vtech's support appears to be all by email...no support telephone support number could be found on their website."
2,Disappointing,"This phone was very disappointing. The handsets are unreliable. Every once in a while, for no explicable reason, they just won't connect to the base. Also, there is no speakerphone button, no hold button, and no quick shortcut buttons for frequently dialed numbers. I didn't really need an answering machine as we have voicemail, so the buttons on the base unit are useless to us.I have only had it a week but plan to return it today."
1,Lest we forget,"The recipes are authentic and delicious but I hope the irony is not lost. These are not Junior League recipes but recipes from ""the help,"" the folks that served the Junior Leaguers their meals. The plantation is a source of pain for generations of local families and to profit from the skills and traditions of these folks continues the exploitation that makes it hard for New Orleans to move on. Just be honest about who's recipes you are enjoying."
3,I will NOT continue to purchase this series!!,"Having never read any manga before i took a chance with Battle royale. The first two books were interesting and i think for a couple of weeks i became obsessed with wanting to know what was going to happen next. In that time i purchased through AMAZON the korean edition of the battle royale movie, so in two hours i became aware of everything that is going to happen. The books do offer you a lot of background information on the characters, told in flashbacks. Book 3 offers a lot of info on the very evil Mitsuko, while the story was interesting i was shocked by how graphic the book is. Now i'm not a person who is prudish at all, and i'm not easily shocked, yet i was stunned at how graphic the depictions of sex were. Overall it was too much,i already know how the story ends so i'm definetly NOT purchasing book 4. EP"
4,Good intro for the novice,I knew nothing about it but now I do thanks to this simple book on the subject and well laid out to get a good overview and now I could easily get involved and learn more knowing the basics.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the ""Hundred Acre Wood Haunt"". We thougt it was going to be a Halloween movie. The cover also lead me to believe it was a movie, in fact, it was episodes of the TV series which we like but again we thought we were buying a Halloween movie. We bought the Heffalump Halloween movie but it is a little too scarry for my 2 year old."
1,Not Halloween,I agree with other reviews. I thought it would be like Micky Mouse Club House and have a least 1 Halloween theme show. The only Halloween show it Handy Manny with is not why I bought the DVD. Very Disappointing!!
3,Okay but not great!,It's a good DVD but not as good as some of the other Tigger and Friends. Keeps my kiddo entertained though.
4,Spin a tale...,TNC are a great lil band from New York. It's gothic rock with razor like rhythm.. really quite good. Mark the vocalist has a powerful voice and it has something unique about it. In a genre when everyone sounds like Eldritch or Curtis it's nice to hear something fresh. TNC takes the real life and adds a fairytale spin on things it works quit well. A few tracks have a wonderful siren of a femme vocalist on them as well.. really quite pretty. Actual violin and cello and one of the few bands out there in the genre that hasn't caved in to going more electronic.. I expect their next release to be even more of a treat. If you like things dark but powerful this is for you.. it's not that swirly girly stuff nor is it repetitive bleeps..
4,"Something New, Something Fresh...","I've been a HUGE fan of Logisitcs since the spacejam EP, and when I heard a rumor about 6 months ago that Logistics was coming out with a full legnth album, I was excited to say the least. Logistic's last big hit, ""Blackout"" was (in my opinion) the last song he released with his older, and more epic style. Most of the new material on this album consists of the roller variety...with more subtle drops, bouncing basslines, and smoot vocals. If somebody expects a CD with nothing but slamming tracks similar to ""Thunderchild"" or ""Together VIP"", they could be disapointed... Some standout tracks include: ""Everything is Illuminated"", ""Beatbox Master"", and ""City Life"". I gave this CD 4 stars because this CD doesnt contain the type of tracks that made Logistics so famous, but it is something new and fun to listen/dance to... A must have for any true Logistics/Hospital Records fan!"
3,not same as the picture...,"The picture of the item ""Cables To Go - 03182 - 3.5mm Stereo Female to RCA Male Y-Cable"" show that the item has a gold plate connector, but item that i receive is a silver plate connector, so the sound has no fullness as my headphone does. disappoint for pay more and got less."
1,WRONG ITEM,"Ordered this item to be used the day I open. When I opened it, it was the wrong item! It was a male to females head phone splitter."
2,very low quality,"this cable's rca contacts just don't grip and make a decent connection. i have about 10 other rca cables in my studio, most are cheap ones, and this it the only one with such a problem. the metal for the rca connection is so super thin you can't even crimp it for a better connection. i really would not use this for anything (even the non-critical application i had in mind). now i have to order a decent one or go to radio shack. also, connections are not as pictures. mine are silver."
3,It's just not what the picture shows.,"The picture of the item shows that the item has a gold plate connector, but the actual item I receive is a silver plate connecter, it works and does the job, but it's just not what the picture shows."
2,"i'll see u in heck,lilo and stitch....by Dr. Doppler","this game is not very fun at all.i loved the movie,and i hated this game.(odd,isn't it?)i instead reccomand treasure planet (PS2) if you are lookingfor a good based-on-a-movie game."
2,A Focus on Fighting,I don't think Disney's Lilo and Stitch is really age appropriate. The game's main focus is on shooting the aliens and killing them. That's not what fun is about!
4,Pretty Nice Game,"Okay, when I started playing Lilo and Stitch and saw that you had to kill the aliens with your gun, I thought: 'Peh. Another leap-and-dodge-em game.' But eventually I got interested in it and nearly passed the first level. (Geez, I haven't even passed level 1 yet!) I had to go online to get passwords for some of the other levels cuz I was getting sick of playing level 1 over...and over...and over...Unfortunately, the game's storyline is nothing like the movie unlike the PC game. In GBA Lilo and Stitch you have to stop Dr. Pestus and these mousquito guys. Gameplay is slightly difficult. Reccommended for ages 9+."
2,Hard to swallow,"I found these large and hard to swallow. I know not everyone has issues with swallowing large pills, but if you do, you may want to try another source."
5,Great Product... Great Service!,"When I originally ordered this, I was contacted by the company, telling me that they were bombarded with orders that day and this pefume was temporarily out of stock. They said they would try to send it by a certain date and to my surprise, it came earlier than they has quoted me! Thank you... one happy and wonderful smelling customer!!! ;-)"
1,This is a Flash 5 book?!,"This book sure LOOKS nice, but it is severely lacking for a comprehensive Flash 5 book. It really seems like this book was written for Flash 3, as none of the new Javascript-like syntax or object-oriented nature of Flash 5 is covered. Any of the examples can be done in Flash 4, VERBATIM. I agree with the guy in the first review - this thing is even wordier than the manual that comes with Flash, and not much better. I would suggest any potential buyers to seriously look at other books before buying this one."
1,lousy,"book looks nice, lots of pretty pictures, but just doesn't compare to other flash books out there. books like Flash 5 Magic cover so much more stuff you'd think this book was about a different program. plus flash magic and other books are cheaper! this is a no brainer - don't waste your money on this book."
5,Worth the extra money,"Faced with a tight deadline and an short fused client who wanted a cool Flash game for his web site - I headed over to the local B&N to check out books on Flash 5. There were no shortage of beginner's books, and several that were filled with awesome examples of Flash sites. What I wanted was a book that not only gave me inspirational ideas, but one that would show me how to build a complete application as well. This book had two examples that could easily be retrofitted for my needs. Although it was the most expensive Flash book on the shelf, it was worth the extra money. The cd-rom inside the back cover is also very cool."
1,the instruction is so annoying,"I bought this book since i wanted to learn Flash, and I have to say what a dissappointment it was. I think the author wasn't very clear on his instructions in some cases and in other he overly repeated himself which is extremely irritating. A beginner as I am, I'm overly bugged by his ""millimeter by millimeter"" instructions. I bought this book hoping to learn Flash only to find it so annoying that I didn't bother going back looking at it again after the first 4 chapters. I gave this book the one star for its nice graphic work which I think is the one best thing about it."
5,This is the one that you want,Our baby - who hates being strapped into anything else - loves this car seat. The firemen who helped install it for us at the car seat installation site remarked that they were very impressed with the seat and how well it can be anchored. They trained my husband on installing it and he has changed it to other vehicles with ease. We have a small car (98 Civic) and it fits nicely rear-facing. No problem in our friend's SUV either. It is worth the investment for the stability and the comfort.
3,Somewhat engaging; not as good as XBox,"Having played Luxor 2 over and over in the 3 years we've had our XBox, I've always wondered what came before it. I found Pharaoh's Challenge on Amazon for DS only, and bought it used. Glad I didn't spend a lot! While it's moderately fun (I'm rather easy to please), it's not nearly as challenging as some of the screens on the Luxor 2 but uses the exact same screens - maybe modified to be a bit easier. You will rarely or never lose, even on the toughest level. Like I said, I still like it and it's entertaining enough for me but certainly not a challenge. Maybe it's named after a very laid-back Pharaoh... By the way, the directions say to use the stylus but it's better to use the buttons."
4,Beautiful Nativity,"The glorious stained-glass cathedral windows of England inspired Fiona French to create this wonderful celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. The words, directly from the book of Luke from the King James Bible, are brought to life with bright beautiful designs. Although the traditional words may be too advanced for very young readers, they will be drawn to the book for the illustrations. This concise version of the Nativity would be an asset for personal collections."
2,the mushy middle,"The X-Men began with a bang as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced Magneto, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Vanisher, etc. But they left after awhile and turned the book over to Roy Thomas (one of his first regular assignments), Werner Roth and Don Heck and the book declined. Despite battles with the Juggernaut, a rare guest appearance by Spider-Man and various stunts (new costumes! Professor X dies!), the book seemed to be marking time. The title will pick up dramatically in volume 5 with art by the legendary Jim Steranko and get even better in volume 6 when Roy returns and teams up with Neal Adams. Sadly, none of that appears in this book. I would recommend this collection only to completists."
4,Very interesting concept for an 80's comp,"All of these songs are good songs to begin with and so changing them at all is going to ruffle some feathers. Some of the songs are exact distillations of the hit songs, others feature distinct artistic additions. What I find interesting is how some of these songs I'm just sick of listening to regardless of the new version, and some I'd love to hear a lot more because of the new version. Gotta love Berlin's song and how it gives the entire thing life. The main reason it's not a 5 star is the John Waite song, it's not different enough and I've heard that song to death."
3,Half-way to a good time,"This was a good concept - a good idea that didn't work in some cases and worked really well in others. Some of the songs are nearly unrecognizable and some just lose all steam. Like the MTV Unplugged series...sometimes just sitting down with your instruments doesn't qualify for acoustic or stripped down. It's just lazy and sometimes sad. But not all styles and songs work acoustically, and some just turn out lame.However, some, like Billy Idol, Men at Work and Rick Springfield really make it work. Thomas Dolby is stripped, but far from acoustic - perhaps to much to ask from such a techno-sound and basically unfair. Howard Jones is remarkable - as is his audience. Some nice moments, but only half of it really works. Perhaps the fault is whoever chose the tracks or the artists to try this."
4,Enjoyable flashback,It was great to actually hear the words to these songs. A couple didn't translate well into acoustical. But for the most part it was really good. I would reccomend it
5,An Eclectic Masterpiece!,"Cleavant Derricks excells at delivering a song. His musical compositions are complimented by his rich, colorful vocals on ""Beginnings."" If you are a fan of variety and original music, then this CD is for you. From the driven, bluesy song ""Cruisin' LA,"" to the riveting, tear-jerking melody of ""A Matter Of Time,"" this CD will bring you pleasure, sadness, and a touch of something only a great performer such as Cleavant can deliver. My advice: GET THIS CD! You will not be disappointed."
5,Great tunes for young kids.,An old friend turned me on to this CD and my young nephews and niece love it. It is really upbeat and fun and the lyrics are great. It reminds me of songs from the early days of Sesame Street before the show started going down the tubes.
4,AN EFFECTIVE NIGHT TIME TREATMENT,"If you're a Perricone fan, you know the importance of nighttime skin care. (If you're not already a fan of the acclaimed doctor, read his book ""The Perricone Prescription"" and you will be.)We've been following his diet for several years now, and we look better, feel better, even sleep better. But, I digress. Evening Facial Emollient is a light yet effective night treatment that works to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles.Use it in combination with Dr. Perricone's cleanser and day care, and we think you'll be well pleased with the results. For use, thoroughly cleanse skin, and then smooth Emollient over face. Do be sure to go from the hairline to the throat.- Gail Cooke"
5,My Review,"a very informative look in the making of the ride,movie and the phenomena of Pirates of the Caribbean,mates!"
5,"Ahoy Pirates of the Caribbean Fans, this book is a treasure!","I thought that Jason Surrell's book about the Haunted Mansion was great, and this book is just as wonderful. Read about the original idea proposed for the 'walk-thru' version of the Pirates of The Caribbean ride, go through each scene of the actual ride and find out the differences between the California, Florida, Japan and Paris rides. There are many photos and illustrations throughout the book (some of which I've never seen before). The book ends with a section on the movie and points out certain scenes taken from the ride. Overall, this book is worth every penny! I am looking forward to Jason Surrell's upcoming book on the Disney Mountains (Space, Thunder & Splash)"
5,Wonderful,This book really gives a good historical take on the greatest ride in the world. Mr. Surrell really gives deep understanding to the planning and execution of POTC. I would recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in Disney parks.
1,Deep Scratches,"Very disappointed would never buy from again... rec""d DVD with 2 Very deep Scratches and DVD only plays one of 3 shows."
3,Great for toddlers,My 2 yr old son loves Micky and thanks to DVR we have a ton of Mickey Clubhouse episodes recorded. The only reason why I give this 3 stars is because they are episodes we can watch on the Disney channel and not a movie. I was looking for a Mickey movie as a treat.
2,Not as informative as I thought,"I thought this book would have cute new creative games, and it's the same boring stuff that you can get from magazines like Cosmo and Maxim."
3,Not the Best.....,"large print with MAYBE a paragraph and pictures that use up an entire page make up the space between these covers. it has a good NEW idea once or twice...but the book is filled with commonly known ""turn ons""-- my husband and i were not impressed...now it just sits in the back of our bookcase-- not strong enough BY FAR to even think of showing off amoung our other books. im thinking about giving it away as a gift to a new couple getting married who are virgins and dont know much about sex. thats what this book should be labeled as :beginners guide to fun sex--if you have lead a sheltered life and dont know any better.sorry--sad but true"
2,Creative and Possibly Illegal,"This book has some fun, interactive ideas for couples to get to know each other more intimately (i.e. quizzes and discussion starters). However, some of the highly exhibitionist ideas in the book are likely to land a participating reader in jail, if caught (i.e. ""When you find yourself at a restaurant table with a long tablecloth, use your feet to bring your lover to orgasm. Don't stop when the waiter's there""). Maybe I'm too conservative...I just know that I won't be recommending this book to anyone."
5,Boom Chuck Rock Now,"I had moved away from Portland in the late 70s and missed the beginning of Billy's career rise. I came back to Portland in 1985 after college and I met producer Jan Baross, who was in the process of making a KOIN-TV documentary about Billy and she asked me to help. It was through that process that I came to know Billy's music. At that time he was working on Flesh and Blood, but Jan shared Boom Chuck Rock Now with me. I was amazed at how different the two albums were, but they were both excellent. I know many people think Billy was full of himself, but his cancer humbled him. I had a couple of good chats with him before he died, and the person I got to know was not vain or self serving, he was a beautiful soul. I recommend all of Billy's albums. They are all unique and that shows what a talented artist he really was."
3,Harriet gets another life,"I had no idea that Harriet the Spy had a sequel in this book written by keen fan Helen Ericson. She has Fitzhugh's style down pretty well, but alas, there is no substitue for character and plot development. There are simply too many unlikely events to make this story very believable, unlike all the original Fitzhugh books featuring Harriet, Janie, Sport and the rest. These characters come alive, as written by Fitzhugh, through ordinary actions made special through great characterisation. If Helen Ericson continues to write about Harriet, I hope she spends more time around kids to hear what they are saying rather than thinking up odd plot devices."
4,Exciting Debut Author,"I started this book during my lunch hour and couldn't put it down. I left work early just to finish it. The book moves at a quick pace, and every chapter leaves you guessing what is going to happen next. The book is written by a new and talented novelist, Catherine Burr, whom I can't wait to read more of. I anxiously await her next novel."
5,Extraordinary,"I never waste my time on reviews - until now. I heard this CD on my television at the Peninsula Hotel in Bangkok - it came on every time I turned on the T.V. Since there was also a T.V. over the faucets in the bathtub, I listened to it in the bath and the bedroom every day. It is absolutely fabulous! It is far and away my favorite CD (and I have hundreds)! I'm buying them for all of my best friends, and I'm looking for more by Steve Erquiaga."
4,A Really Fun Book,"Hi, I'm 13 years old and I've just read Galibrath's Will. I really enjoyed it. I love fantasy books and I really like old bookshops, so this book was perfect. I especially liked the chase on the flying carpet and Banks the goblin who is really evil and sneaky. I also thought this book was different as the ending was a real surprise. I will definately read the next one when it comes out. If you like a book where there is lots and lots happening, then I think you'll like Galibrath's Will."
3,Confused,Although I love this case I was under the assumption you received 3 in an order and only 1 was shipped. It works for what I need it for but I now have to wait until I have another large order so I can put this as an add on item since I need 2 more.
1,Expensive,"I just had the same experience as Christine and the other fellow with the paper feeder. The paper feeder is touchy and now it pulls 2-3 sheets in at a time.I bought to machine in November 2005. It did not come with full toners. I replaced 4 toners $600 March 14, 2006 with the copy counter at 9385. The copy counter is at 14166 as of May 10, 2006 and it says the black toner is out which will be $150, the OPC belt needs replacing at $500. That equals $88.24 per 1000 copies to date. When I ran out of the black toner the first time, the other three needed replacing about a week later. So if that occurs again it will cost $120.00 per 1000 sheets."
1,JUNK - AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"I do not usually write online reviews, but this 'printer' is such JUNK that I just can't help myself. Everything the others are saying is absoluteley true. The first thing that you will notice is that the thing is horribly noisy. That's nothing compared to what happens later. After just 400 pages, the OPC belt died. It costs hundreds of $ to replace. The tech support was OK to replace it free, but the new one lasted for just 100 pages! The color cartridges are already low and I am now starting what I'm sure will be a process to get my money back.Do yourselvs a favoure - AVOID AVOID AVOID"
1,"Great color printer, lousy everything else","Let's see--i paid for a color laser printer, scanner, fax, copier. I got . . . a color laser printer. The printer worked all the time. The fax worked about half the time and the scanner never. This is my first review but you can certainly believe that I rushed to return the unit after the first week! Glad I did--would not want to wait to see all the other problems that the folks on this page had!"
4,Perfectly Acceptable Technical Support,I have read several postings that criticized Brother's Technical Support. I just got off a 29 minute phone call with their phone support and was very pleased with the outcome. I have owned theBrother MFC-9420CN Network-Ready Color Laser Flatbed MFCfor over two years and am very pleased with the performance. I would recommend this Multi Function unit for the small/in-home business application.
5,short but sweet,"This record has great songs, only too few! the video is very enjoyable. i recommend it highly."
1,Pornography?,"Someone purchased this book for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas. I was putting all her gifts away for her and I opened to the last page of this book to see how it would end (I wasn't planning to read it) and I discovered that it actually reads (at least the last two pages read) as an article in a smut magazine. Glad I decided to spoil the ending because now I know that my daughter won't be reading this one.Be warned, this book contains explicit sexual imagery."
3,Know the author,"I have not read the book yet, but it was written by my best friends little brother. Who is an adult now. Can;t give a rating, until I read it."
4,Wild Style in the brain!,"This a good example of graffiti book. All collored, with many photos... In this book, have a really history of spraycan art, in USA and Europe."
2,Garbage,"Pros:1. Anybody that can complete a 100 mile run has my respect whether he can write or not.2. When he chooses to actually write about running every 25 pages or so, it is pretty good.3. This one cracks me up - when he goes from the garbage stuff to the running stuff, he changes type faces. It's more of a bold font. His writing is still pathetic, but at least he tells me where the better stuff is.Cons1. This book isn't about running, its about some sort of religion thing. Running is just his means of talking about his religion thing.2. I just finished reading Dean Karnazes book, Ultra Marathon Man. What a terrific book: short sweet and to the point. Then I pick up this piece of trash. How depressing ! Dean's book just made this ""book"" appear that much worse"
2,"Assorted 6 pack, assorted review","I was dismayed, and disappointed, to have opened several of these boxes, to find that some of the fizzy tablets were somehow wet, and ruined, rendering them unusable, and certainly not to be ingested. I have no way of knowing if it is water or some other moisture that ruined them. The ""cherry cola"" ones were black and gooey, NOT like Fizzies should be. It is quite a mystery, since they come in boxes wrapped in cellophane, within individually sealed foil packets.Also, some of the flavors inside each box did not match the flavor displayed on the outside--that was not such a terribly big deal, just odd."
5,Fizzies great for diabetics,"I bought the assorted pack of fizzies as an alternative to the constant water I've been drinking since being diagnosed with diabetes. I think they taste great. They are made with sorbitol and splenda so there is no aftertaste and it doesn't make your blood sugar go up. My favorite flavors are orange, lemon-lime, cherry, and sour apple. They also offer root beer and fruit punch but I think the fruit punch tasted more like bubblegum. I didn't get sick drinking it unlike another person's review. I think it would be a great alternative to diet soda which I can't stand."
3,Comprehensive but faulty,"Theses Bio-bibliographies vary in quality. This is not one of the better ones. The volume is full of inaccuracies and VERY expensive but it certainly captures the breadth of Alice Faye's career and for anyone who thinks of her only as a film actress, it is a revelation.However, the errors and sloppy editing could have been avoided because the author had access to all the corrections but did not bother. Sadly, this perpetuates the errors so that the uninformed just does not know what is correct and what is not.The references to articles about Faye and interviews with her are particularly useful for those who wish to learn more."
3,Cool game.,I played the first manhunt. It was cool. Graphics are to be expected for a PS 2 game. Not impressed with the phasing out of the insane kill shots. Guess it was too graphic for the wussies out there. I'm waiting for Manhunt 3 to come out. If it ever does.
1,CENSORED,"The executions, 90% of what made the original great, are completely censored. They put a heavy red and blue blur over the screen whenever you perform an execution and move the camera repeatedly. The end result is you can only see the outline of your character and victim, and not what he's doing. This game is pointless now. Thanks a lot to the ESRB, censorship advocates, and gutless retailers who won't sell AO rated games for making sure this 31 year old couldn't play a gory video game. You've saved the world, and cheated me out of $30. This is the worst gutting of a game since the original Mortal Kombat on the SNES where there were no fatalities. BTW, the graphics are awful by modern standards. Not even worth a rental."
5,I want to buy a copy of this book! HELP ME!,"March 22, 2001 Obviously this is not a review. I've been searching everywhere for this book without sucess. Please if you have an extra copy you would be willing to part with send me an e-mail MJBahr007@aol.com Thank you! P.S. I'm planning on bringing my 26' sailboat with a crew of 3 or 4 to the Apostle Islands the first week in August 2001. If anyone else that reads this is going to be up there during this period of time please feel free to send me an e-mail and maybe we can raft up some evening and swap dinner and tales! It does not matter if you are a power or sailboater all are welcome!"
2,spend a bit more for something better,It's worth spending a little more money for something nicer. The seams are sown a bit rough especially at the wrist. My wife spent about 8 dollars and her's is much better than this one.
1,hoax,"does not work mary kay products in my opinion are a waste of time and money, they dont work nor live up to standards.i have tried many products and they all have not worked for me.. i have wasted a year on mary kay and nothing.garnier and neutregena has showed me more results and there way less money.. save your money and time."
3,two (too) chamomile,"My 6-pack was slightly different from what was described. There was no Wild Berry Zinger (my favorite, darn). Instead, there was another chamomile--honey vanilla chamomile. I bought these herb teas to add to my green tea to make it drinkable. The chamomile doesn't have much flavor. But, Celestial Seasonings are fabulous teas, especially all the ""zingers"". Just didn't get quite what I wanted..."
1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK! SPARE YOURSELF THE BOREDOM!,"I have to agree with a lot of the people who didn't like it. It is dull, and the maximum length of the chapters are four pages long, although most are only two. The story was also choppy, going in one chapter talking about Kathy the Queen of Cats, to the different types of hair in her family, is pretty bad. I'm no writer myself, but I love to read. I know a good author when i see one, and Cisenaros isn't one."
1,"In today's market, Jefferson would be in jail","I can't believe this is a so-called ""love story,"" now that is a joke. How old was Jefferson's little black girlfriend? She was 13 or 14 at the most. Wasn't Jefferson married? Yes he was, but he was no different than any other slave owner, they all slept with their slaves. Wasn't Jefferson's girlfriend a slave?Yes she was, what choice did she have? [...]The movie would be much better if they told the truth. This is not a love story, rent another movie. If Jefferson were alive today, he would be on trial with Michael Jackson; however, his guilt would not be in question. Why do Americans (and I am one too) continue to hold this man so high? This is not a love story, what he did is a crime."
5,Great Historical Movie,"This is one of my favorite historical movies. It is a sumptious telling of Thomas Jefferson and his affair with 15 year old Sally Hemmings. The scenery and the costumes and the story line are absolutly wonderful, so is the acting. This movie is deffinatly worth 5 stars!"
4,Lost & never found,"I reordered two of these for my wife and me. We both managed to have them fall off our belt never to be found. Either spend $3 for the safety lanyard, or make your own out of some fishing line, string, or heavy thread. A simple loop stuck it under your belt (or through your belt loop) & back over the odometer solves the problem & we've not lost one since. There's even a hole already in the odometer clip. (For the price, they should include such a cheap fix (less than $.05) -- then they could have 5 stars.)"
3,hip pedometer for aerobics,"This pedometer is fine for normal activity, however it does not effectively work for aerobics exercise."
5,Easy to use,"Totally met and exceeded my expectations. It has different modes which I use: steps, moderate steps, calories, distance. It clips on my side and stays all day. It's accurate and makes me feel good when I look through the seven day history to see how well I've acheived my 10,000 steps for the day."
5,Omron Pedometer,"It's small enough to not bother you and works well. You can't shake it to get more steps so it keeps you honest. All the option you can see, like how far, and being able to look back make it extremely easy for me to keep a accurate record of how much I'm walking. I'll probably never use a different one again."
5,Simply Perfect!,"This pedometer is by far the most perfect little device ever! I've owned numerous pedometers in the past and this one surpasses them all. It is inexpensive, simple to use, accurate and sturdy. If I could give every single person on a diet the Omron Aerobic Pedometer, I would. It is quite simply the perfect pedometer."
2,I wouldn't know how it works!!!,"I wouldn't know how this product works!! I was so excited to get it and when it finally came about three days ago it didn't work! The battery was already dead! I must say, we all expect batteries to run down and have to be replaced. However, one wouldn't expect the first thing you have to do when you get a product is replace the battery and wait another two weeks for the battery to come and then, finally, you can use the product. I'm a little disappointed, I must admit."
4,Good Product,"This is easy to program, easy to use, easy to read , and it works well. Also, a good value."
2,Omron HJ-151 Hip Pedometer,"Very unreliable, as are most pedometers I've bought since my first, cheap but reliable purchase (can't remember the name of the very simpe step counter). This counter skips ahead and I have to deduct about 30% of my steps after a walk."
4,"Good Product, Poor Battery Life","I bought this pedometer a few years back and used it continuously for a few months. I put it in my gym bag and forgot about it for a bit and when I went to use it again a few months later, the battery was completely dead. It probably was turned on in my bag without my knowledge so I know not to store it anywhere it can get bumped again.I'm buying the same pedometer again because it was accurate in really inexpensive for the quality - Omron is a great brand. On the days I don't go to the gym, it really does motivate me to do more walking.I personally find it too big to wear on my hip with my work clothes (women's business casual) because it adds too much bulk right where I don't want it, but I'll wear it after work and on the weekends when I'm not trying too hard to look nice or when I'm in jeans or other casual clothes."
1,Acccurate for 6 weeks then far off.,"I began using this two days after I received it. At first it was accurate - I was walking a measured mile.Then last week it began ""gaining"" steps at a significant rate. I would walk 10 steps it would record 15. This morning it is doubling my steps. I walked 10 and it recorded 21.I walked half a mile and it showed I had walked 1.3 miles.I am very disappointed in this unit because it is small enough to not be a bother to wear it.I am buying another, by a different maker. I like Omron products and trust the blood pressure monitors I have but this is just too far from accurate to be of use."
4,Go See Karen Live Too!,"I saw Karen Goldberg live Sunday, October 22, 2000 when she opened for the British singer, Julia Fordham at The Birchmere in Alexandria, VA. She has a very melodic strong, and fluid voice. She sang the songs ""I Went To College,"" ""Treading Water,"" ""Germany,"" and ""Sneakin'"" in her set. I would recommend this album because she is such a great performer LIVE!!!"
3,Is not bad.. Is not great.. is to EXPENSIVE!,As I said this it's not a bad movie but is too expensive for what it is. I did like the movie but I did not like what I paid! If I were you I would wait a little longer!
5,Frozen River,"This indie movie about two women living in poverty who join forces to earn money through illegal means, was intelligent, well-paced and gripping. All the characters were well-drawn and the viewer was able to engage with them and care about what happened to them. And of course, Melissa Leo is the best actress on the planet."
5,Frozen River,If you haven't seen this movie you must watch it! It's a great movie! I enjoyed it and will watch it again. Great story and actors too.
4,A strong woman attempting to carve out a better place,"The Blu-Ray was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35 player. The sound and picture quality are respectible.I was not familiar with Melissa Yeo's work, until I saw this film. The film has a very slow pace, and the yearning of the mom's character, to carve out a better life for herself and her children is obviously. The atmosphere of the film, is gray,ordinary and hopeless, which is exactly how the characters are portrayed initially. This is a sad story of survival, and hope for these two women, who run paralell lives in many respects. I enjoyed the film, but I think Melissa's performance certainly steals the show. The film was very genuine, in its feel and execution, and I'd recommend it for a ""dose of reality"", and for an interesting examination of the fine line between legality and the struggles with a person's own moral code."
2,Trailer Trash: The Movie,"A depressing little movie about dumb trailer trash white woman and how she tries, with the assistance of dumb trailer trash Mohawk woman, to make money by smuggling illegal aliens into the U.S. in the trunk of her car. She has no real regard for the poor people she stuffs in there; rather, she only has $ signs in her eyes as she lusts for a double-wide trailer so she can finally take a bath (which she badly needs, along with a complete makeover). The woman's kids, now fatherless since she shot dad/hubby in the foot because he is an on-again, off-again degenerate gambler (thus causing him to split for fear of losing his other foot or, perhaps, another, even more vital, appendage), are perpetually without food because she instead spends her meager earnings on a rent-to-own plasma television, cell phones and cigarettes. Hard to sympathize with her because she's so dumb and so callous about her human cargo."
5,Frozen River,"The DVD that I purchased, Frozen River, was shipped in a very timely manner and was an excellent movie that I had been waiting to see for quite a long time, because it never really ""hit"" the movie theaters in my area for some unknown reason. Thanks again for your prompt service and very reasonable price!!Jan L Jones"
4,more pleasure,This book was very informative and an easy read.The reason I purchased the book was it was by a world renowed author and all her books are an easy read and informative.
2,NOT SO GREAT,Cumbersome to use. Ended up using the system without it after a few minutes. Not very sturdy and made the sharpener difficult to use. Maybe the C-Clamp model would be better
1,Don't buy this book! Transliteration only!!,This book teaches Russian by spelling out Russian phrases in the English alphabet. This means that you could finish the whole book and then not be able to read one word of Russian.
1,Not this dumb,"First of all, the audio CD was broken (it is not protected enough in its plastic sleeve). Secondly, I didn't like the way the cyrillic alphabet was not used in the book. If you're going to learn Russian,you should start with mastering the alphabet and the vocabulary should be taught in Cyrillic. Otherwise it's not really Russian that you're learning."
3,Crash Course Use Only,"I normally like anything published by this company, but this is one of the more useless books I have ever purchased. If you find that you are going to have to travel to Russia on a short notice, and you want to learn how to say some basic things like asking for help in an emergency or finding a rest room, then you will get that out of this book. This book will not teach you how to carry on conversations in Russian, nor how to read or write or understand the Russian language and grammar. It is, simply put, a crash course to teach the non-Russian speaking person how to ask for help if they are in Russia, and have not had ample time to learn Russian."
3,Good book to bring you down to earth,"I found this book very useful in bringing people back to reality as to the speculative nature of option trading. It even includes very good advice as to how to avoid (or mitigate if you will) losses. I only gave 3 stars to this book as it does not provide strategies as to how to pick correct stocks, and as they say, winning in options is 90% stock selection and 10% option trading.It is a good purchase for anyone starting in this business. Wish you all luck."
3,A Game Only UFC Fans Should Check Out,"UFC Throwdown is a decent game i had some spare cash and decided to purchase it. The game isnt that great i mean it's not bad either but it has alot of flaws. You cant fight up against the fence wich sucks, there aren't that many fighters. If your a BIG UFC fan then you should get it but if your not than your not missing out. Im a big mma fan but this game could be better i recommmend that you purchase UFC Sudden Impact, PRIDE Fc, and K-1 Grand Prix all for the PS2 they are better mma games than UFC Throwdown"
1,Yeah this game sucks!,"This game was fun right until the intro ended, everything else in this game was terrible."
2,Could have been better!,"The graphics and background stages are cool but every thing else sucks. Dead or Alive3, Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and even Dragonball Z: Budokai are better. Dragon ball z's stages are horrible but the moves and the powers are awesome. The only problem with this game is the character moves, stunts, storyline, intro movies and endings. Tekken 2 and 3 are way better. If you are a tekken fan first rent it than buy it."
4,Its not as good as Tekken Three or Tag Tournament .,Tihis game was personally a little disapointing for me. The graphics are wesome but other than that its not so great. For one the game play isnt as good as the original Tekkens and the music [stinks] period.The characters arent that great either I was pretty disppointed with this game.If you do want to spend fifty bucks spend it on Madden 2003 that is the best game.
4,Tekken could be better,"This game has exellent graphics and such and such, but there's not a whole lot to do thoughPros:Some of the best graphics i've ever seenesame ol' controlls, great gameplayTekken force is back with a diffrent namebeautiful backroundsVery detailedThere's enough modes to lastTheater mode has improvedGreat voice actingU can beat someone up on the wall, and kill em'must I say anything about the girlsStorymode is a new feature, well not that newCons:No tag modeWhen something breaks, it looks fakeLess selectable characters for tagFew new cahractersNot much to unlockIt seems as though nothins new, makin it only look like a beter Takken 3No new modes like Tekken Ball or bowlOvercomplicated storywho the hell's the winnerAnd it's a bit slower than Tekken 3 and TagOverall:It's as not as good as Tekken Tag, but it's still a great game. Vurtua Fighter 4 and Tekken 4 are the best fighting games of this year"
3,Still the People's Champ...But Still Not the King.,"Keeping up nicely with the times, ""Tekken 4"" is undeniably a great fighting game. Although not bringing anything new to the table, it is still a formidable force to reckon with. It has everything from sharp, polished graphics and fast fighter combos with a pretty good storyline backing it up. The cinematic story scenes (although short) are intriguing to watch and add a lot of depth to the game. The play control is responsive and the moves are relatively easy to pull off (unlike Virtual Fighter in many ways). And while it's not going to revolutionize tournament fighting as we know it like tourney legends ""Street Fighter II"" and ""Mortal Kombat"" (the truth hurts, doesn't it?), ""Tekken 4"" is still a welcomed entry to a seemingly ailing genre. Fans of the series with surely embrace this latest installment as the ""Tekken"" franchise continues on, full speed ahead. That is until the ""Deadly Alliance"" comes to town at least."
2,Tekken needs somethinf new or it lose.,"I give this three stars because it is a good game, but just a little better then Tekken Tag. The characters' polygons is almost the same as it predecessor only the environment has a considerable upgrade. It feels a lot smoother then T3 and TTT. TTT gave us all the characters and now we have to go back down to 19 or 20? There is no Tekken Bowl or Volleyball, which girls would actually like to play. Good thing I only pay $20 for this. Hopeful, Namco does something more excitement in the next one or this franchise may become a Street Fighter."
5,The BOMB!,"I've played Tekken 4 at Neddle's before and loved the game. I'm a big fan of the Tekken games. I have to say Tekken 4 is much better than Tekken Tag.My favorite player is Christe and Jin. If you get any other fighting game this year or next year, get this game. It's the BOMB! It is so life like, you get hooked in to the game really easy. And who said girls can't like fighting games."
1,Difficult to understand,"Very difficult to understand. Although MPLS is not an easy topics, author presentation is not good enough.MPLS fundamental is better."
2,"confusing, badly structured","If you are looking for a clearly written book on mpls and vpn, don't buy this one. You probably will get much useful information from cisco's website.The book is carried in a confusing way and the authors can't present clearly what problem they're trying to solve, or the logics behind the solutions. Most parts of the books is words piled up together without much meaning or logic."
1,2K sports FUMBLED BIG TIME,"Waited for this title eagerly for years. Unfortunately, it came out to be the biggest game disappointment of the year. I have been a fan of the series since the days of Dreamcast NFL 2K and I have bought and enjoyed every single installment. This is the exception. If you have 2K5 don't even bother to buy this one. 2K5 is way better. I gave it 1 star just because there is no option for Zero stars. I guess we are stuck with mediocre Madden whether we want it or not.Way to drop the ball 2K sports!!!"
2,"It's ok, but...",I wasn't too impressed with the video. The sessions were short and it would be great for someone whose never done yoga and is just starting. I wouldn't recommend it for someone in advanced yoga.
4,Book Club Emergency,"I submitted this book title for our local bookclub because I enjoyed it so much. When it was selected, I was dismayed to find out that only a few copies were available in our library system. I said I was willing to see if I could get a few more copies with the idea that I would donate them to the library afterwards. I ordered 8 copies from all over the UK and USA for delivery by regular mail to our small town in Alberta, Canada. I ordered them through Amazons New and Used and got 8 copies for a total of about $90.00 including postage. The book retails for $19.99 so I was thrilled. All 8 copies arrived in time and in perfect condition. Most copies were brand new and all were in excellent condition. I'm thrilled with the price, procedure and speed of this series of transactions and will happily place further orders using this service."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this phone for my granddaughter's room for her birthday. I bought it 3 months before her party, so once I had given it to her, too much time had passed, therefore I could not return it. The neon light only lasted 3 weeks, plus the ""numbers"" don't all work either. This is a very cheap phone, and had I not purchased it so far in advance, I would have returned it. It is a total piece of junk."
2,bad battery,"After a few months your battery capacity will drop dramatically, like down to 2-3 minutes of usage. Replacement is $20 plus shipping. Check the reviews on older versions of the euro-pro- I wish I had."
2,"short life, big waste","worked great for about 6 months, but there are no replacement filters available and the battery no longer holds a charge. not worth getting a new battery if there is no filter. now it's just going in the trash which seems a big waste considering the product worked for less than a year."
3,Had to get a replacement due to wrong new battery,"Had to get a replacement due to wrong new battery, replacement was a c510 but with more speed. It works fine."
5,GREAT,"THE PRODUCT REPAIRED A TEAR IN MY LEATHER COUCH. IT WAS EASY, FAST AND NEAT, THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT AT A REASONABLE PRICE"
4,Great,"I really enjoyed this book. But be warned: if you are looking for a book that describes how the album was made don't look here. ""Music from Big Pink"" is more fiction than fact, and the central focus is on what life might have been like in Woodstock at the time - the parties, the drugs, the music.What really struck me about this book was the Niven's use of evocative language. The way he described the Band songs, especially when he was hearing them for the first time, was poignant, rich, and insightful. Hearing the narrator talk about the songs really made me want to listen to the tracks; and when I did, I certainly had an enhanced experience.Overall it was pretty good. I say buy it!"
4,Super Why DVD,I ordered this and my child loves it. Huge Super Why fan! Found many to choose from here.
1,My ten cent review for a worthless game.,"I'll make this quick. The graphics are ok, the story sucks, and the game play is worse than AIDS. If you like the crime genre try Max Payne, cause this game Blows."
4,A very sweet game,"I went to a friends place to check this game out, I'm hooked. Itmay resemble Max Payne in many ways, but this game does alot morethan M.P. For one, Max didn't have the auto-targeting, a dog that does the cool $hit he can do, no hand to hand skills( which by the way looked like max was [not smat]), and not quite as colorful an environment. The camera angles were the biggest pain I had with the game, not impossible but a pain sometimes."
4,"Great Game, Great Controls",There is nothing wrong with the inverted pitch control style on this game. If you are smart enough you will get used to it and appreciate it.
1,Very Poor Controls,"This game has a great concept but the game play and controls really stink! It's a 3rd person perspective shooter game with very poor camera views. Most of the time you won't even know where the enemy is firing at you from. To make things worse, the right thumbstick, which is used to control the camera view, is backwards, pressing right makes the camera go left and vise versa. The graphics are definitely PS2 graphics, this game shouldn't have been released for the Xbox. Overall, if you're looking for a great shooting/adventure game, I'd recommend Splinter Cell."
2,Redundant Button Basher & Bad Camera Angles,"This game could have been good. The fighting, weapon, and maneuvering mechanics of this game are nice. What kills this linear game is that it becomes redundant very quickly plus the bad camera scheme. Keeping a good camera angle has to be constantly adjusted by the left thumb stick. The fighting in the game along with keeping the camera angle on what you are doing is distacting and leads to too many free shots by the enemies (especially when you are in a fight). You'll probably spend most of the game repeating scenes over and over again. It seems the developer rushed this game and didn't take the time to exploit the power of the Xbox, which is easily the most powerful console out now."
4,"sweet graphics, nice game play","Dead to rights graphics is sweet,and the game play is nice, however, but parts of the story line really slows down the exciting intense game play. Over all, I have really enjoyed playing the game."
3,"Great Idea, Terrible Execution","This game has awesome graphics and incredible gameplay features. It comes with bullettime, human shields, unbelieveably sweet disarm moves to take guns from other people, and some awesome hand to hand combat tricks. It actually feels like a John Woo Movie, or actually, the way a John Woo movie would be like if the main character wasnt completely invincible. Half the time you are trying to fight 10 different guys at the same time, with the bad camera trying to see every angle but you can't. This is the most insanely hard game I have ever played. If your up for the challenge or you want to see a game with features never been done before, rent or buy this game it has some great new ideas. Just be prepared to throw your control against the wall a lot and spend over 50+ hours on it"
1,Only Gimmicks,The game is all aobut the gimmicks and that is its only star. the same is way too difficult to even try and get past the second board. i rented it for a week and played it once i also rented blinx and found it was one of the best platformers ever. don't play this game play halo or max payne. unless u r interested in gimicks
2,Please vote to show your support or disagreement!,"This game has many things going for it, but I am not going to itemize those things. The reason I rated this game 2 stars (and subsequently cancelled my pre-order) - was solely because of the RIGHT THUMBSTICK. It infuriates me to no end that I must press (the RIGHT THUMBSTICK) RIGHT to look LEFT and vice versa. It boggles my mind that there is no menu option to reverse the polarity. Prisoner of War - has the same exact flaw. Let me be as clear as I can (in the hopes that video game programmers are reading). All players want the most ""intuitive and flexible"" controls possible - so that they can become effecient at killing bad guys. Pressing RIGHT to look LEFT will NEVER EVER EVER be intuitive for me. Please AGREE with this comment so that we send a BIG message to the video game makers. HALO's controls are perfect - don't reinvent the wheel!"
2,not cool,"This game is kinda unrealistic...because for example in this game once an oponent gets u in a submission you tap out automatically and in the real ufc that does not happen like that...also the submissions come out of no where its unrealistic...like for example I was boxing one of the fighters and they did some kind of jump thing and locked an armbar on me while we were standing there boxing, thats terribley unrealistic...also when your on the ground for the cpu to flip u over is way too easy and sometimes its terriblely hard to get them off of you...it is an ok game but it is just so unrealistic when it comes to the fighting."
4,As expected,"as advertised. Cheap product, my son broke the first one, but it does not claim to be a high end needle."
3,The Meadowlands Book,Its a good book. Its been a while since I read this book. I really dont remember reading the book. I may had to purchase and read this book for a class. My apologies if I wasn't able to help the buyers about to buy or read this book.
5,The Best Of Techno indeed!!,"I first purchased this album in December of '91 at a record shop in Rocky Point, NY and I have not found anything else that could even come close to the quality of techno this album contains."
4,Still love Claudine,"It's terrific when an artist creates a wonderful first book and then is able to follow up with even more projects and techniques to teach and inspire. College Discovery Workshop: Beyond the Unexpected is clever, creative and whimsical. If you loved Claudine's first book, as I did, then you will surely enjoy her second.I took a class from Claudine this past summer where we got to make our own poppets from current family photos. It was so fun to create a victorian-inspired puppet from a 49 cent plastic funnel, a wooden dowel rod, some paint and a picture of my husband. Very creative and cheap, too! It was also lovely to see that Claudine's personality in her books is as equally engaging and sweet in person. It's hard not to like her and her work."
4,Great Techniques,"I now have both of Claudine's books in this series. While I'm not a big fan of her style (ie - poppets), I love the techniques. Using household items to work wonders on surfaces fascinates me. I've tried several already and plan to try more. This book is a worthwhile investment."
4,Inspirational and easy to techniques to follow,"I bought the first book and loved it so much that I HAD to have the second book. The book is well layed out and the instructions are easy to follow. You don't have to be an ""artist"" or have any special materials or tools to create your own work of art. I like the way Claudine explains what she is seeing and feeling when working on a project and how to let the project guide you. I am a scrapbooker and had never tried collage before I read Claudine's first book but now I use some collage techniques in my scrapbooking."
5,SWITCHING GEARS-RETHINK YOURSELF!,this second book totally switches gears from her first book in a good and different way. if you are looking for a change this book is for you! her first book had lots of dark and grungy looks while this one goes to bright and whimsical! i would consider myself on the more seasoned side of collage and sometimes i get sooo bogged down in details that i need to step back a couple steps and see the simpler side again to clear my head. this book helps me get back to that blissful middle ground. great techniques to be had and a refreshing look at a softer simpler side of collage. great job claudine!
4,"Takes some learning, but worth the time!","I am an experienced gamer, and like most gamers.. dont read the directions, just pop in the disc and play. This one isn't so easy to pick up right out of the box, but once you get the hang of it, it is a TON of fun. The characters make it really entertaining and the color commentary is really worth it. Graphics are tremendous! When you mess up a shot... take it from me... take it out on your caddy!"
5,Umbra Lattice Sink Caddy,I bought this caddy to use with a stainless steel Polder sink rack that didn't come with a utensil holder. It's just the right size. It hold at least 20 to 30 utensils and can be hung on the sink divider if desired. Perfect little time saver and very stylish. Matches my sink and sink rack just right. I'd highly recommend it.
2,"Build needs to be thought out, not recommend.","I bought this caddy from Bed, Bath and Beyond and used it for about three months before it started to deteriorate. First, the holder part of the caddy is covered in a silicon type rubber to help it stay put on your sink divider. But over time the rubber cover started to rip and fall apart little by little. Eventually almost half of the cover ended up coming off and the caddy didn't stay put at all. Second, the metal caddy is welded in certain places and over time the metal starts to rust in these spots which make it look horrible. Since Bed, Bath and Beyond takes pretty much anything back with a receipt I returned it and got my money back. I don't know if it was because I like to use extremely hot water when I do dishes or what but I wouldn't recommend this caddy at all."
3,"Okay for a sponge, not so good for silverware","I bought this to hold dirty silverware until I could wash it, to keep it from going down the disposal. It is much smaller than expected (yes, I read the measurements), and not quite deep enough for that purpose. The handle also does not grip the center divider in my double sink very well; it is constantly getting knocked off. It works okay as a sponge holder, but that's not what I really needed."
1,Couldn't get this to hang on anything,"I wanted this to work very badly, but it did not. The lip is doesn't allow the product to hang anywhere near my kitchen sink. Not on any of the edges of the sink, not down the middle, not on the dishrack I across one of the double-bowls. The lattice is a great idea to keep silverware from falling back into the sink basin, but I just couldn't make it work."
2,Wrong Size Lip,"Although this is a good product, I should have measured the width of the lip around my sink because the Umber handle does not extend far enough. Therefore this product is totally useless because it keeps falling back into the sink."
2,All Star? What!?,This has to be the weakest baseball series there is. Buy a different baseball game and be much happier.
4,nice cover,"it is a light, pretty nice cover, fits nicely over my Graco stroller. Thereason why I only give it 4 stars are the air holes on the sides. In addition to air circulation they also allow for rain to get inside the cover... my daughter does get wet if we happen to be outside in the rain. It would be nice to be able to cover one or both areas of air holes. Also, it took a while to get it shipped from the seller."
3,Just going through the motions,"I have been enjoying Rowley's Bazil series since the first book, so it was with disappointment that I realized how tired Rowley must be of this series. This is clearly a 'mopping up' exercise that didn't seem to capture the author's imagination, and didn't capture mine, either. I won't ruin the book's ending (too much) but it seemed to be inspired by Saturday morning Japanimation. Perhaps the author was trying for something fantastic or surreal; it came across as a lamely imagined cartoon. I do look forward to his next work; hopefully a new concept will invigorate his storytelling imagination."
3,Its ok,This is a decent step-by step guide to finishing your basement but there are better out there. Even though its 1998 it seems very dated. This book contains no photos for design inspiration it is only a how to manual. Taunton's Build Like a Pro was much more thorough and current.
4,A visual and practical guide for creativity by the very best!,This is a very practical book and fun to read with many sketches and inspiring phrases and philosophies from many different Imagineers! It is like taking a vitamin C juice full of creativity that will leave you wanting to start right way developing all your ideas! A good book for creative people or aspiring creatives alike! It is like having a Disney FastPass ticket to all your favorite attractions! A ride of 208 pages that will blow your mind with a unique quest for creating and obtaining endless possibilities and special outcomes for all daring creatives out there! It will leave you yearning to use your brainwashing techniques on white pages to fill with your ideas!
2,This game is overrated.,"Although this game had a bunch of good reviews, it, as well as all XBox Baseball Games, aren't that great. This one doesn't make full use of the many buttons on the controller. A to hit and pitch, No turbo, No powerswing. The players look like they do on those nintendo Japanese games. They all look alike. The crowd looks flat. It's impossible to walk someone unless you dot them with the ball. It's too easy to hit the ball. Even on the harder settings. There aren't many different looking hits on the replays. The announcer should be fired and when you are fielding the ball the reaction time is very slow. I do like the classic uniforms though. And the franchise mode is OK. If I were you, I would wait to rent Slugfest 20-03 and see which one is the better one."
2,"Stats dont even carry out through carrer, game [bad]",I bought this game after reading how great it was and I found out after many hors playing that is is a patheticclly boring game. Theres no salary cap and stats dont carry through careers. dont buy this gam trust
4,Lo que queria mi hermano,"Mi hermano estaba cansado de la radio que tenia su civic y me contacto para pedir este molde especial para poner radios de otras marcas, el quedo facinado porque no pensaba lo eficiente que es este pedaso de plastico. Se recomienda totalmente."
1,really dissapointed,the case was broken when it arrived. I was less than thrilled with it. I guess I just got a bad one...
2,Deceiving Looks!,The finish of all the products inside are rather poor. One of my majorly regrettable purchases here in Amazon. I wouldn't recommend this even if you have been painting the same thing for the last twenty years.
4,Worth looking at,"I rented this game, and yes the graphics are nice and the gameplay is acceptable. If you like water games, get this game. However, I still like WaveRace64 better. For some reason it has a much greater fun factor and still rules the roost in my opinion."
3,Seiko watch,"The watch is fine however, paid for next day shipping and received the watch four days later. Left a review no response will not buy from this company again."
2,So so,Cards are soso. I've seen a lot better. Plus cars paper is cheap and thin. I wouldn't buy it again.
3,Somewhat confusing,"The stockings shown in this book are just beautiful, HOWEVER, I found the directions on the first stocking I made to be somewhat confusing, especially regarding the total number of rows to be knitted before shaping. I consider myself an experienced knitter, but I had to write the directions on scrap paper to keep them straight. I hope the other stocking directions in this book are a little clearer, as I really look forward to trying another one."
4,The Ability to FLY,The beganning of this book tells of a idea on how to fly. throughout the entire story the author gives a really exciting description on the technique. Enjoy it and at the very least you get to come along for really COOl journey!
1,Cheap and defective,"Would NOT recommend for medical marijuana patients because the defective items cannot be returned as per federal guidleines as to shipping DRUGS through the mail. Once it is used even for a second, they are COVERED with contaminates and cannot be mailed.NICE! NOT"
1,"This author ""tells"" instead of ""shows""","The author is more likely to write something like ""Marisa was sad"" instead of making us feel Marisa's sadness through showing the connections with other people. The characters were all stereotypes."
5,DIGIMON FUN FUN FUN,i haven't actually played it yet but i know about Digimon season 4 like a lot of people do it is called digimon frontier anyways that is of the subject i heard you well i wont tell you but let me say this you will like it if you like digimon
5,"I'm a girl, and I like digimon.","I have the game digimon world 3. First off, you start by picking your first three digimon. Then you go on a journey to 4 sectors. North, South, East, and West. You must beat the leader of each sector to get to the world champion-ships. It's really fun because you get to raise your own team of digimon to become the best."
2,Disappointed in this cookware,"After using a set of stainless steel cookware for 30 years, I bought Calphalon Essentials (purchased at Target) because I wanted no-stick. After only three years, I'm glad I kept my stainless steel sauce pans, as they still look and cook great after all these years of use. My Calphalon pans are stained on the bottom and the non-stick coating is peeling off. I have not used metal utensils or put them in the dishwasher, but do have a ceramic-top stove. A friend gave me a birthday card that said, ""Any pan is no-stick if you no-cook in it."" That is my experience with Calphalon. High maintenance and short-lived. I'm back in the market for some stainless steel."
1,Beware ...,"...You may not have to guess how I feel about ""Mike Tyson's Heavyweight Boxing"". It is a horrible game and was no fun at all. The graphics are pretty good and the control method is quite a good idea but the game itself is very frustrating and ridiculously hard. Even after I used a cheat to unlock Tyson, I still got pounded and KO'd by Audley Harrison within 30 seconds.I'm really disapointed because I have been waiting for this game to come out for months and now that it has I wish I hadn't bothered.There are much better fighting games on the PS2 but unfortunately it is still lacking a good boxing game."
2,"Mini Elephant Creamer 2 oz., White","Cute tea/coffee accessory however, it was too small to use as a creamer. I'm currently using it as a tooth pick holder which worked out much better for me. I ordered another elephant creamer which was larger in size and it worked much better for serving cream."
4,Looks great on our big screen Sharp tv,"Although it has a limited selection of games it might go down in history as a true milestone in Nintendo's history.It will be better than Nintendo 64 mainly because Game Cube's controller is easier to use but also because Sega and Sony are now on Nintendo's future game lists. I think Super Smash Bros. Melee is one of the best games out there. Super Mario Sunshine should be like the other Mario games(as fun as they are challenging) and it promises to have more levels than Super Mario 64. Finally we are going to have a 3D Metroid game(is there even one for N64?I dont think so). Metroid is amazing. I still love the old one because of the password option,the unusual music and the ugly graphics. If the new Zelda is even close to being as good as Majoras Mask and Ocarina Of Time we will be very thankful.The future is looking very bright."
2,Not up to par,"Very disappointed with this release. First, it does not seem HD quality at all. The stories were also mediocre at best. I'm a Batman fan, but only liked one or two of these (last video in particular). The animatrix was much better made than this collection. Rental at best. But if you're set on buying, just get the DVD version. Can't imagine it can be really much better than the Blu edition."
4,Animated Gotham,"This sure wasn't the Saturday morning cartoon that I remember, but it wasn't quite a disappointment. I'm not a really big fan of Japanese animation but I was impressed by the different interpretations Of the Dark Knight if you are a true Batman fan. It's worth putting in your DVD collection"
4,animated Batman,"I ordered this for my husband who loves the super hero genre. I was disappointed to see it was animated, but he loved it."
1,Very disapointing...,This is a horrible DVD. We are huge Batman fans and that is why we ignored the reviews.. Bad idea.. It's not worth the money.. Save it and go see a movie..
1,No Batman In Batman,"There is no story. Saying there are 6 short stories in the DVD is so wrong. There are more like 6 10-15 minutes clips. After I've finished watching the 6 clips, I am speechless. I have to ask myself why I wasted my 60 or so minutes of my life to watch these clips. If you want to waste $20 bucks for this DVD, I suggest you waste your cash on the 2 Batman Beyond movies with plenty of spare changes. The two Batman Beyond movies with tons of extras are 1000x better than these clips in this DVD.This DVD is no go for me. 1 star it is."
1,"Holy Doo-Doo, Batman!","What was that? Yup, that's what I exclaimed as I started watching, continued watching, and finished watching the BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT DVD. I grew up and loved watching superhero cartoons every Saturday morning. I have tens of animated and live action superhero DVDs. However, this one was a definite stinker. Were these animated segments the winners of a contest...or the losers?Batman & Robinhad a better plot.The only thing good about this DVD was the animated Wonder Woman sneak preview. And that was only in rough sketches."
2,Anime does not suit Bats,This is probably the poorest animated adaptation of Batman ever. The shorts are well...to short. They never really go anywhere and they definitely don't fit in with Nolan's Dark Knight. This just seems like a pure marketing scheme by WB and DC. Make a new Batman DVD just as TDK comes out for all the suckers to buy(or rent). The only redeeming value of this disk are the original Batman Animated episodes. They are much richer and have better animation in my opinion. I admittedly don't like anime style but even with good animation this would still stink.
2,Gotham Knight-Bad night,"This DVD was horrible.it's story lines made it hard to follow and the animation was Aimee, which made it worst.Not worth the purchase price or the time to watch it."
2,Disappointed,"I got excited to hear about a new Batman cartoon feature. Not only that, I got sucked into the hype when I heard the voice of Kevin Conroy.The story is loose, not all that together. The 6 interlocking stories makes no sense at all. Batman's suit looks more closely like the Azrael Batman. Most of the drawing are too Akira like. And, that is not a good thing actually.Kevin Conroy is the Batman, but Masterpiece, this feature is not."
1,Worst Batman I've ever seen,"This is just a collection of random Batman cartoons. First off the animation is just horrible. Second, have the people who made these episodes ever even read a Batman comic. The stories are pitiful. The art in some of the episodes is passable, but mostly it just annoys. The first episode being the worst drawing I think I've ever seen, Ren & Stimpy was better done. If I go on any longer my review will seem like some hate-filled rant so I'm going to stop now. Trust me and DO NOT BUY this. Re-watching any episode from Batman: The Animated Series (Batman TAS) is better than seeing this for the first time."
4,strong material from belgium,"With their first ever commercial single the belgium band ""das pop"" have finaly made their first step into the big world of pop. the true fans knew them for ages, while their fresh sound might sound like their fellow belgiums ""dEUS"" to a lot of people. they are significantly different though. as their music is a lot darker, but also even weirder then that of dEUS, it even sounds good to people who aren't already known with the band. electronica for lovers makes a good first attempt at todays music fanatics."
1,If you have read the books you have already read THIS!,"If you are looking for something new from Moose County read The Cat Who talked Turkey,if you have read all the others. If you are new to the series start at the beginning. But this book is nothing but excerpts and if you are a die hard fan you have already read all this. Avoid it!"
5,Wonderful Book,A very Good book by By Eva Braun. I love kindle Books I can take them anywhere I go to read.
3,Knorr's beef noodles,"The noodles were all very broken, but the taste was there. I purchased these because they quit selling them where I live, but I wouldn't buy them again. They were in such small pieces that you couldn't eat them with a fork. We had to use spoons."
2,"Let's talk about the game system, not games.","I believe that all the game consoles should be judged based on the game system itself. This is Gamecube review, not super mario or zelda.I like nintendo games but not the gamecube. it doesn't support dvd playback because nitendo deliberately made their own format(smaller than CD) to prevent others to copy; this saves lots of money by not including it. What a shrewd business move. Their disc format can't store more data than the sony's and that is not a good thing. Plus while Xbox got a 20GB hard drive, GC does not and you need to buy a memory card to save your game. All these facts reminds me of N64.Yes, i hate the huge size of the xbox(also the controller, but you can buy the japanese version), but at least it has lots of goodies. Xbox has potential even though it doesn't have many killer games like GB."
1,Half Baked Project,"This system is a terrible effort by nintendo to get on the market. It was obviously rushed. First off, the cotroller is terrible and when you press one button, you end up pushing four. Second, the games are coming out every half a year. This system is going to have no games and can't compete with xbox or gamecube. Third, it's meant for kids. Why else would it be so small and the discs so tiny? So kids can use it. This is nowhere as good as my xbox and i barely ever play it. If you want a good system, get xbox, PS2, or play that PC you paid so much for..."
4,The GCube (as some people call it).,"The game cube has some good games and some games you can't understand the meaning of. It has some advantages, like the games Super Smash Bros. Melee and, Pik-Min. It has a lot of disadvantages, like not being able to play DVD's on it and the games like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Max Payne that PS2 and XBox have"
5,a dinosaur..................picolopalo,"the gamecube is the best console to be made.I have this console and its so unbelievely good.This console is so much better than the xbox, so if you want a brilliant console get this one not the xbox."
4,Great Book!!!!,"This book is a great faith-building story about the famous biblical Jonah. It has a great moral, the characters are well-described, and the fast-pacedness makes it an easy read for anyone. I recommend this book to preteens, teens and adults everywhere(especially Christians)."
5,How would you feel living inside a whale??,"This a great book for readers of all ages. Takes you on an exciting, in-depth journay of the struggles of Jonah and his journy inside the belly of a whale."
5,Amazing,This was a page turner and kept me interested. Definitely an amazing book! Lots of twists and turns!! I'd read again:)
1,bad bad bad!!,"bad bad bad. BUY KNOCKOUT KINGS , AND RENT THIS BOXING GAME. DO NOT BUY IT ,ITS HORIBLE , THE CONTROLS AND GRAPHICS ARE [not good] BY TODAYS STANDARDS. (BAD CONTROLLS). BAD SOUND BAD BAD BAD...HORRIBLE.WOW i AM SUPRISED IT MADE IT OUT ONTO THE MARKET. THIS GIVES ME HOPE AS A GAME DESIGNER. A 10 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE EXECUED THIS GAME BETTER.(( DONT BUY IT))"
4,Awsome!!!!,"This is for sure one of the best games ever!! It is a bit Marone, and many of the characters as Ugo Pieracci and Igino Ugo Tarchetti ar well reproducted. Even li mortacci tua's Fans are true and graphically well done. The only problem is when you face the terrible Salvatore d'Amico on the right corner! And go fighting against Mario Sereni who is the PRO Champion. This game is realy worth buying!!"
2,All Text. No Illustrations.,"Full disclosure: I am an amateur cook. I purchased this as a gift for my wife because we've recently grown interested in making pot pies. We have an amazing homemade recipe that we've used over and over again; however, I thought it would be fun to branch out into different recipes.I am a visual learner and glean lots of information from presentation photos and process photos in cookbooks. Unfortunately, this cookbook has neither. The only picture you get is the dust jacket. The rest of the book is only text. I'm sure it's quite suitable for many, but I don't prefer it for teaching me how to cook these various pot pies."
5,Nice stone...,This is easy to use but keep in mind that if you have some really small fine serrated knives this may not go into the supper small serrations... Worked well on my Gerber Gator knife but remember to take your time when using this or you will not get a good edge... I'm not saying that it's hard to use but that you want to sharpen each serration... I recommend this because its a good tool for the job but you will need the main set to get the needed clamp and rod... When used safely and correctly this works great!
3,Expensive and Lacking,"This title is a bit wordy for such a short subject. I think in this world where most people are online, and you can have a flowing chat the want ads seems a bit outdated. I am happy she found her husband but realistically how many people will want to go about it this way? Surely there are better ways to meet someone and this book tries to overly convince that one way... is the only way. What this book lacks is color, humour, interest and for the price I had a right to expect more."
2,Static galore,"This phone has lots and lots of static when a call first comes in. It clears up after about 5 minutes, but if I had known about the static problem, I probably would not have bought this phone, no matter how cute I thought it was."
1,RCA Corded Retro,Too light weight and can't see the display. It's not lit so you can see the caller's ID! I returned it!
4,cute,"This phone is really cute and handy. It is very light, though, and everytime I answered it, the entire phone would follow the handset toward me. I solved this problem by putting a mouse pad under it, now everything is great."
2,Didn't work,"I thought this product would look great on my desk, and it did.But, unfortunately, it didn't work. I sent it back and Amazon credited my account without any problems."
2,Wish I could say better,"I love the design of the phone and the caller ID feature. However, I could not get a dial tone because the button kept getting stuck. I even tried some WD 40, which loosened it a little, but it still didn't work. Then the caller ID was missing cells so I didn't see the whole number. Now I have to decide do I want to chance and try to get another one. If it worked it would be perfect for my small office and it is so visually appealing. Very sad to give this review because I had high hopes for this phone."
2,Cute but NOT PRACTICAL for everyday use,"Like another reviewer said, the phone is too lightweight, and falls off my nightstand as soon as I answer it everytime. What's worse is the numbers are not in the standard place so dialing by touch is not easy. It also could benefit from a lighted keypad. This is not working for me the way I had hoped... I wanted a retro look phone with modern features.... I guess I have to keep looking."
1,Lasted 3 hours,"Fire hose flyer vs 60lb Goldendoodle - ripped one side and made short work of the inside rubber layer within a couple of hours of it arriving. Worse, I ordered 2 by mistake!"
3,"Ehhh, was ecpecting it to be better",I've heard all kinds of reviews from the game but I have to say it's not the same 2K5 game that was released in '05. But it's enjoyable enough play I guess.
3,fan favorites,"The best feature of this game is, obviously, the players. Anyone who's been watching football for the past 20+ years will recognize many of the names available to put together a team of great and pretty good historical pro football players. This was a great idea as Madden never did more than make historical teams with ""numbers only"" players. Another good feature is the price point. $20 or less is a pretty cheap football game for anyone's budget. The gameplay itself is okay and is pretty much what they had with NFL 2K5 before the NFL and EA Sports cut them out of the pro football video gaming business. Overall the game is better than Madden 07 for the PS3 but I doubt that it's better than Madden 08."
3,Your Child Has a Disability,I have a child with Cerebral Palsy. I found this book to be the best layman medical explaination of the disorder that I have read. I recommend it to family members to help explain the disability to other people.
1,Night Games,This book has to be the worst thing I have ever read. I stopped after about 100 pages but started reading again....hoping it would get better as it went along. I suffered through to the end. Was never so glad in my life to reach the last page in a book.
4,"great book, but......","yes i loved the book. CF has again done a good story. my complaint with this book ( and it's not just this book or just CF's books) is that the heroine or hero, whomever is ""fighting the feeling"", fights, and fights, and fights, and fights and......you get the drift. after more that several pages, several chapters and a third to half of the book, IT JUST GETS OLD!!!! For this reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars."
5,"Night Game, Christine Feehan",This series has had me spellbound ever since I started it. Will there be more?
5,Feehan produces the best reading pleasure,Christine just gets better with every book she writes. Gator is a very strong character like a modern knight out to slay the dragon and save his fair lady. Flame is a much damaged child and a brave woman. The book is wonderful a great read. The print format is definitly flawed some of the pages fell out because of the larger size and shape of the book. This in no way prevented me from reading a much awaited book. I just hope the publisher works out what is obviously their mistake before her next book is published.
4,Coleman multifuel stove,"I bought this stove in the mid-80's (as the Peak 1 multifuel.) I ""lost"" it in a divorce and borrowed it back for a canoe trip last weekend. It worked perfectly first try after sitting with the same fuel in the tank for 6-7 years.Good heat, relatively quiet, lights directly without liquid priming (except when using kerosene).I never did go on a trip where kerosene would be an advantage, so haven't tried that. At the time I bought it the multi fuel seemed more refined than the gas only model so don't regret the extra cost. I'll revisit that decision when I buy the next one.The biggest fault I see is that very smooth bottomed pots may slide off. My cook set has an extra windscreen that prevents this."
5,"Old-time value, new-time fun!","From the onset, you will notice a marvelous job of mastering. Professional quality, charming music. If you want to get down, let it all hang loose, and relax, this is the CD to get. Want to find out, listen to the samples. Bought another of these after listening to it, to share with a friend. This is a true delight."
1,Not the real Sam Moore thanks,"Maybe it's good -- who knows-- but this is NOT the real Sam Moore, of Sam & Dave fame or Overnight Sensational fame. Just FYI"
4,Great pan!,I recently purchased this stir fry pan and it is a great one for the price. It is heavy (which is good because it conducts heat evenly) and holds enough food to make stir fry for 4 people. The handles stay cool so you can hold them while cooking. It's flat bottom is great for my electric smooth surface range. And it cleans up very very easily with just a couple drops of liquid dishwashing detergent.
4,Ultra Fun!,"When I first poped in this rental, I was completely amazed with the graphics and gameplay. Everything seems so real. THe characters blink and their eyes move and even their mouths too. The game is fun and challenging. I love the doubles matches THere is also a world tour mode too, meaning you can create two characters to battle it out in the real world. Its way fun if you have a sibbling around.But I think there are a couple of flaws. Where is Pete Samphras, Andre Aggasi?"
2,Poor battery life,"For the price, this vacuum is probably fine for a cordless. Though the battery loses its charge pretty fast. I recently upgraded to the $100 Hoover with the Lithium Ion battery and that thing purrrs."
2,Shark Cordless vacuum,"The shark SV736 is a nice vacuum,but I am disappointed that the batteries died in less than one year."
3,Great vacuum if you don't have a big dog,"I have a golden retriever, and needed something that would get his hair off the furniture.This product, with the beater bar attachment, gets the job done, but the hair gets wrapped around the small beater bar in seconds and I have to turn off the vacuum and cut the hair off the bar with scissors. It does the job I bought it to do, but stopping to clear hair from the beater bar is a pain.There's also a curved 90-degree turn that the dirt (and hair) has to make as it enters the dust chamber. The hair does not make it through the turn and into the chamber, and ends up clogging the intake.In summary, if I didn't have a big hairy dog, the Shark would be the ideal handheld vacuum. It really is pretty powerful. Works great in the car, in the kitchen, and other places where there is no large quantity of dog hair. Where there is dog hair, not so much."
5,5 Stars so far,"I just opened this little Shark and my first test was our stairs. We have 3 large dogs and 5 cats and I was amazed at how well it cleaned the stair carpet. I agree with a couple of reviews about the end of the roller brush being a little thick for the crevices on the stair, but I learned a trick from my previous hand vac. Get a wire pet brush from your local dollar store and quickly scrub the crevice at the base of each step. Use the vac to suck the hair off the brush and finish the step, it only takes a second and works great. I did our stairs in about 10 minutes where normally it too around 20 ore more. Ny only previous experience is with my Black&Decker; 19.5 volt, which will suck paint of the wall, but without any type of agitator is useless for pet hair on carpet or fabric.Another tip is to buy a cheap little waste basket to keep handy by the stairs or carry a grocery bag with you while you vacuum. Like all small hand vacs the bust bin is on the small side."
2,Quality control no good. Died in 1.5 month. holds 1 minute charge,We had an older model or another shark handheld vac. it lasted alright for 2 years still picks up but it died. battery life can't be recharged. You can't replace it. plus no parts for itwe grabbed this. works as good for 1.5 months daily use like 2-3 minutes. it then only works for 1 minute and needs to be recharged.they probably equip the cheapest batteries. There are screws to open up the battery compartment but there are no spare parts on batteries and it's easy to remove. Once you remove the battery it 'll all fall apart.I guess they want you to buy another one.I am going to black and decker
3,Good while it lasted,"I was looking to replace my Black & Decker Dustbuster that had lost its suctioning power. I decided on the Shark after reading all the great reviews. It was more powerful than my old Dustbuster and was quite pleased with its effectiveness in picking up kitty litter. It also did a decent job on carpeted area with the included motorized brush. However, after 13 months of everyday use it no longer holds its charge. I was hoping this one would last."
4,"Durable, Good suction","i keep this vacuum in the trunk of my car or in the garage when it is charging. great tool for picking up spills on carpet and a quick fix for stairs when company is on it's way. cleaning the product is the only downside. to be thorough, you really need to unscrew the parts. not a big deal though. overall, very satisfied."
5,Works great,I love this thing. It works great for picking up pet hair and cleaning up small areas in between major vacuuming. I have recommened this to everyone who ever sees it at my house.
5,Great pocket vacuum,"enough hp, the brush really helps, love to have it ready to get rid of crumbles!!!"
4,Shark vacuum,"Bought the Shark for my wife as a Mother's Day present. For some reason, I thought I was going to be able to mount the unit in the garage. Guess what? There is no cradle or hardware to gang it on a wall. I have no idea where my wife put it. It is not as handy for both of us. I do see it charging once in awhile and she says she loves it. I think it is in the guest room dresser. Oh well!"
2,"Reasonable overview, but could have been much better","Hoyt's book provides an acceptable overview of a section of Tojo's life, but the book suffers because it does not delve deeper. Hoyt fails to provide any explanation as to why Tojo developed his beliefs or why he acted as he did. For example, there is no discussion of Tojo's childhood, and very little information regarding his family life. While these need not be key to Tojo's biography, such facts might have provided more insight into the man.Hoyt also seems driven to prove that Hirohito was not responsible for the war; in fact, he begins the book commenting on a BBC documentary which argued that Hirohito was a war criminal. Placing this view at the beginning of the book casts doubt on everything that follows, making the reader wonder if the author is attempting to shift blame to Tojo in order to exonerate Hirohito."
2,"Good Looks, Lousy Customer Service","First of all, the original model had a 'beater bar"" in the rug attachment. This model lacks a ""beater bar"", making it less effective in picking up dirt.Secondly, customer service is almost non-existent. I ordered replacement filter bags in February and, like clock work, would receive a postcard in the mail every month, telling me the bags were back ordered. Repeated calls to customer service were of no avail, although they were polite. Finally, my replacement filter bags arrived in JULY, making the vacuum unusable for 5 months !!"
4,Great extra vaccum!,"Great for bare floors and OK on carpets (only gets surface dirt off carpet). I have dogs and cats and it does get the hair.The only problem is finding the bags! If you order them from Shark, it takes several weeks to get them and the company does not inform you that items are backordered. I cant find them anywhere else : ("
1,Save your money,"My reason for trying this was for ridding of foot sweat smell on 2 pairs of shoes. It's supposed to kill the bacteria, etc.Between the 2 pair - (one clogs, the other water shoes) - I used almost the entire bottle of Dr. Mist. Different intervals, letting it dry and air out outside. After atleast 6 hours of this, I wore both pair for less than an hour each and the smell was back full power.Forgot to mention - prior to putting them on - I also used the glide on deoderant version on my clean feet. Not impressed at all. Glad I only wasted $9 instead of $15 (flea market price). Save your money. If I do find something that works - I'll update my comments."
2,Did not work for me,"Didn't keep me from smelling. Also when I spray it, it smells a bit moldy to me, so not something I want to spray on me? Yuck."
4,One Major Catch...,Does NOT teach the updated Zaner-Bloser method and nowhere in the product descirption was this mentioned. For example: the capital Q is still formed like a 2. :( Haven't actually viewed the video in order to rate the quality b/c I'm debating whether or not I need to return this video--it doesn't align with my curriculum.
4,Forgotten Gem?,"A British prelude toThe Raspberry Reich, this work is rather satire on a mother country than a copycat ofA Clockwork Orange, in which local UK fascism, Euro-multiculturalism, sex and lust -all mixed in a well shaken cocktail of a laugh and rude humor.Professional presentation of serious issues, easy watching."
3,Smoky Russian Caravan Tea,"I ordered this tea as a substitute for Twining's Russian Caravan Teawhich is no longer available. This one turned out to be excessivelysmoky, masking the richness of the Assam Black tea that it is madewith. I will need to blend it with an equal amount of some othertea to make it enjoyable, I hope."
4,This sucks so good,"Oh brother. Dickie and Mickey Moist strike again.Mickey (aka Mickey Melchiondo, aka Dean Ween) is one of the founders of Ween, and along with Dickey (no idea), he gets his hard rocks off in a major way on this album. Reminiscent of some of the darker moments on Ween's ""The Pod,"" Turbonegro, and maybe early Metallica, this album kicks ass, if nothing else. Loud guitars with occassional heroics, screaming lyrics that are hilarious when intelligible, and huge reverb drum machines frame the sound, which more or less makes me feel like I'm driving around in a Camaro after taking bad acid.This music is not for the casual Ween fan, or the weak of heart. As the dust jacket warns, ""using this product may cause smoking."" If you have doubts, stay away.If you are among the chosen, well, you know who you are."
5,Good ol' American Rock & Roll!!!,"Man, This is Rock & Roll to the max! Good ol' Hard hitten, in your face, guitar screaming drum smashin' ROCK! Don't mistake this for your pro-to-typical mainsteam rock and roll...this is hard hitten direct from someones backyard, drink some beers, put on a wife beater and ROCK OUT! Also this album is funny. But by Funny I don't mean that it's a party prop...this is smart funny. Trust me, you'll listen over and over again, with or with out your friends, cause it's seriously addictive. In The Valley of the Sun and Black train could easily pass for todays MTV played rock songs, they actually sound like, well, you know, they should be huge hits. The rest of the songs are in a catagory all their own...Eventhough I love those two songs I just mentioned, I only mentioned them becuase they sound the most like as if you didn't know who the band was, you would probably like it!Take a chance, If you like hard hitten real American Rock, get it!"
2,Egg Noodles vs. Pasta,"I do not like the pasta and sauce as much as I like the NOODLES and Chicken Sauce. It was my fault that I did not read the whole nine yards so to speak. The fettucini is not my favorite. I will double check next time to make sure it is EGG NOODLES. But it is not all bad, and I am sure I will be able to consume the whole lot. Thank you for asking!Joan Rusnak"
3,zen 'M' carcharger,"Too tightly coiled... makes for pulling the player on the floor of the vehicle. The delivery time from eforcity was GREAT, but the product only lasted about 6 months then I had to get another. I didn't mistreat, just el cheapo, but the price was rioght and when it was not sproinged apart, it did for me what it was supposed to, so this time I ordered two. If the longevity of these is similar I'll write a Mr. Hyde review."
2,nowhere near as good as their other albums,"I'm a fan of this band and the majority of their work, but this album was a bit of a dissapointment. Their first three albums were all amazing pieces of work, but this one while not bad, doesn't even compare. This album suffers from a few things. Although I don't mind Steve Albini, the production on this album is not up to par. The sound overall can be muddy and the loud crescendos that this band does so well, are not nearly as powerful as they should be, why? because for example the loud parts aren't any louder than the quiter parts (listen to track 1) when the big crescendo comes in I expect it to totally floor me, and for it to be louder as well to achieve this, but it isn't... poor production aside, tracks 1 and 4 are the only ones that are good, the other ones aren't nearly as powerful, and they sound like things the band have done before but not nearly as good/melodic/powerful as on their previous albums."
2,Disapointing Album,"This CD is not worth buying unless you're a completionist and already own all the other GSYBE CDs. The brilliant vocal samples are gone and so too is everything else that made their second album, ""Lift Your Skinny..."", so good. The only thing that is recognizably Godspeed on this CD is the predictability of the song structures."
1,El comprador se guarda,"This is a minimally useful educational tool.The guy took 2O minutes of home video of street signs in Mexico City and then added some breathtakingly awful cuts from his Canciones de Mexico collection.He then added 8 minutes of disclaimer, promo, and titles and passes it off as educational video.Unless you are really desperate for material this is just not worth it."
3,Good movie,The movie is about 3 young Indian boys who dream of going to America.The movie though did not do very well at the box office but is still worth a watch.The boys just laze around all day and talk of making it big in America.Until one of them gets an opportunity to go and finds out and everything is not made of gold there.He faces many hardships and finally returns to India an narrates the difficulties faced there.All three of them lose heart.The last scene is pretty good and i wont spoil the fun by disclosing it here.The acting is satisfactory and the music decent.So i suggest get your hands on this one quick.
4,"good quality,still running after all this time.","this vac is still being used at present time,3 times a week,does the job without question.the wheels began to squeak within 2 years but is not a problem."
5,"Don't Make Excuses, be a Leader!","This book is entertaining and well written. The stories used to illustrate the points made are usually an adventure in themselves. Richard Marcinko practices what he preaches and this book will tell you how to do the same. This is an easy to read guide to being successful and the best book of its' kind I have ever read. This gives the reader the no excuses, no BS way to succeed. Buy this book!"
1,Yuck...,"Ponderous and boring, Against the Megamachine is not so much an essay against the empire and its enemies as a cure for chronic insomnia.The arguments are circular and perplexing, with the words ""Nature"", ""Counterculture"" and ""Abstract"" being particularly important to the author, apparently.How such a cakehead could ever get published is a mystery to me. How he could even be a teacher is even more confusing. Keep your $14 for something better; perhaps a book by Ayn Rand, a romance novel of the sort found in the supermarket, or the pros of incinerators."
1,Not Tai Chi Chi Kung,"I own a large selection of Tai Chi and Qigong videos. This is by far the worst. Daniel has thought of some movements that have an ""oriental"" feel to them and has named them ""Tai Chi Chi Kung 18 forms"". It is certainly not ""Tai Chi Chi Kung 18 forms"" as taught by Michael Tse, for example. Daniles' demostration of the Yang Style Short form is rather amateurish and the video production is poor."
5,Excellent Tape,Just a great tape. I had no idea how relaxing T'ai Chi (Chi Kung) can be till I tried this video. The amazing part is that you have a full body workout and a lot of heat and sweat during that relaxation! I am hooked!
3,The Last Days of Soviet Union,"For me, the novel was too reminiscent of a Russian morality tale for the intelligencia. Soviet intelligencia was obsessed with the story of an artist repressed by the state (see Master in Master and Margaritta, and many other works). This novel brings the familiar story line to the more recent times, e.g. nearing the collapse of the Soviet Union. There is a hope that with changing times, the ones that sold their souls to the State will be punished while the ones that stood strong for artistic integrity would triumph. In this regard this novel provides if not a happy, but a hopeful ending to the age-long story of an oppressed russian artist. Unfortunately, knowing the political situation in Russia now, it is hard to see the good triumph. If Sukhanov could just hang on a bit longer, I am sure he could have become the favorite art critic for the Putin crowd."
3,Needs more close-ups,"This DVD is full of essential information, and the presenter clearly knows his topic. BUT I would have found his instruction much more useful with more closeups to really SEE what he's doing. Show me the fingerboard, the nut, the tools, the different kinds of bridges, etc. He would casually mention something but not show you so you could truly see it. It was just kind of there. As someone just learning, that wasn't the most useful form of instruction.It wasn't horrible. Again, Al knows his topic. But it just could have been better.The menus are quite nice, but they do seem to drag on when one is viewing in sequence, as opposed to getting a refresher on a specific point."
2,Not what I expected...,"This was not what I expected, whoever I bought this from did not clearly state that it was THE BEST OF and not the full seasons 1 and 2."
5,Touching take of love and life discovered,"This is a wonderful story of one man's memories of the beginning of his true love life. Roorbach is a compelling writer in the essay style of Russell Baker, who offers his readers much in terms of language and story-telling ability. We, too, learn to love Juliet and touch the unique feelings that make this couple worthy of our attention. Perfect reading outside on a summer afternoon"
4,Solid Design,"First thing you notice is how heavy and solid this lamp is, you could darn near use it as a lever to lift a refrigerator. Works great, a very soft -- yet easy on the eyes light. The lamp's transformer causes static on nearby radios."
1,DOES NOT FIT 2007+ WRANGLER,This is a simple product and probably works fine for whatever models it was designed for but it DOES NOT work for the 2007+ Wrangler. I was able to make it work for the rear sound bar speakers with modifications but they are worthless in the front. If you have a JK look for another solution and don't buy these.
4,Need to see,"For all those wanting to see a touching love story, this is a must see. It deals with those feelings that a lot of us guys (and ladies) have had that you don't feel ""gay"", you don't fit that stereotype you always heard, but that doesn't change the feelings you have for that first boyfriend. See it. You won't regret it."
2,"Nice story, dreadful acting","While the story is a heartwarming one, the skill of the players and the direction is severely lacking. Scenes jump from one to another and the viewer is left to figure out the transition. Not even subtle clues are given as to what may have taken place between the scenes.This story of a frat boy coming to terms with his gayness is one that has been lived by many a young man. The emotions displayed by the actors came across as disingenuous. I'm not aware of the actual sexual orientation of the cast members, but if they are indeed gay, you'd think they'd be able to put together a more realistic performance of what it's like to come out to your friends and to yourself. Overall, not worth the price of the DVD, but if you can borrow it from a friend, it's worth the time to view it."
3,Not too shabby,"This film was very much like those old ABC after school specials that use to air in the 1980's and early 1990's. Though it could have had more emotional power driven through it, and you don't really feel the conflict of the film's message in the main charecter, it is a O.K. sorrow-and-sweet diversion for a rainy afternoon."
5,children book's,they are a good resource for a kindergarten teacher. The product arrived quickly and in good conditions and it was exactly as described.
5,With over twenty well-known celebrities,"Over twenty well-known celebrities and an equally powerful group of illustrators step into the shoes of well-known fairy tale characters to recreate the stories from a different perspective. An audio cd accompanies Once Upon A Fairy Tale, adding performances by the celebrities to these whimsical retellings which take different approaches, such as how it feels to be kissed by a princess, and the perspective of Papa Bear who feels called on to defend his home. Good reading skills required."
2,Rarely heard arrangements given polished performances,"Often times the music listener/concertgoer becomes acquainted with certain pieces that are kind of ""backbones"" of the repertoire in that they are performed often and are audience favorites. Such is the case with Pictures. However, it did not achieve the fame it rightfully deserved until Ravel was commissioned to orchestrate the work, originially written for piano. Herein lies yet another orchestration often overlooked. It is quite a different take on ravel's famous version, using the resources of a very large orchestra and often sounding more dark and ""russian"" in nature than Ravel's French-influenced arrangement. Stokowski saught out to give these pieces the Russian flare he thought they deserve. This recording is a marvel both for its clear, sonic sound, and perfected playing of the Cleveland members. If you like bold, dark, amazingly clear orchestral sound, try to make this recording a part of your collection."
3,article only 2 paragraphs long,"If you do a Google search on the title, you will find the article posted online at no cost.It really is not an article. It reads like a letter to the editors with a reply."
5,Masterfully written,"What a gift! This book has depth and character. It shines with a special light which is palpable from the moment one reads the opening narratives. The stories have us become acquainted with a master rabbi from the 1700's who lit the way for a heart-felt spiritual path to G-d. These accounts are told with beauty and a sweetness which serves to create a yearning within the reader.Not only is the book readable, its scholarship is top-notch. When our story teller departs from an exact translation or adds a detail, he clearly explains how and why he has done so. This book is recommended for one who enjoys sitting by the fire of a master story-teller.Rabbi Elisheva Beyer, Nevada"
5,Works with DTV,"I was very skeptical on the price, and on the ability to split 3 directv HD boxes (one a DVR hd box), from just one wall cable connect, (I like my sports). This product does the job! I do not see much of a difference from the original splitter DTV gave me for splitting two. I do not know much about GHz's and I am not an electrician, but this product works for me. I was nervous that my 2 way splitter had 2GHz and this only had 1GHz, but it works absolutely fine for me. I even bought a more expensive RCA 3 way splitter if this one failed, but going 3 weeks strong, no problems. Just make sure the connections are on well/tight (as you would with any other product), and let her rip!"
3,Zebra Wallet,"Outside of the wallet was fun and looked very nice. However, the inside of the wallet seems very cheap!Son loved it though!"
2,gnat fly traps,"Stick to everything, hard to work with, over sized so don't recommend for anything smaller than a large floor plant or the plant will stuck to paper immediately. Would have returned but had already tried to use them by sinking them as much as I could into the 12"" potted plant....disaster !"
2,THE FOGGY KOREAN MOVIE,I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY FELLOW REVIEWERS ABOUT THIS MOVIE. THIS WAS A MOST DISSAPOINTING EXPERIENCE. THE FOG WAS NOT ADVERTISED AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE A CUT WAS MADE. I FEEL LIKE A SUCKER FOR BUYING THIS GARBAGE. IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. I THINK THAT TINTO BRASS WOULD BE FURIOUS THAT HIS ARTWORK WAS THIS BADLY DISPOILED.
2,Kinda junky,"Was very excited for my three year old to get this toy. Unfortunately, it's junk. The hammer head won't stay on the handle and the toolbox hinge cracked on the first day. The latch fell off with in 24 hours.Tools are realistic but not made to hold up to the normal wear and tear of a three year old boy."
5,Great Tools For Little Grease Monkeys!,These Toy Tools are GREAT!! I had ordered a different set of toy tools but they arrived and were half broken and really poor quality so after alittle haggling I got a refund for those and ordered these. My son loves them and has had them for a long time now and still uses them. He sees his dad work on motorcycles and wants to do it too so these are great tools for a little grease monkey to do some pretend wrenching. The tool box is alittle bit tricky and a ticht fit for all the tools so we put them in something else but overall we love it!!
1,EA CHECK BUGS Before you release your games,"I purchased the World of Harry Potter. It has four games in it by EA. So far all of the games have had glitches and I have had to stop all the background stuff running just to get these Lame games to run. I dont have to do that for any of my other games. Shame on you EA for putting such junk out there on the market. I will not purchase another title from EA until they get some education on games making. Don't buy this game. It freezes, will not load, and you have to modify your computer's normal settings to get this thing to run. UGH."
4,Worked well for us under OSX,"We bought HPCoS with some trepidation over the problems people had with buggy software. I didn't even try to run it under OS9, but under OSX 10.2 we had no particular problems. Running on a G3/300 and a G5/2000 both worked well, though the G3 was pretty darn painful. The voices ran faster than the animation because the Rage 128 card wasn't up to the task. My 5 year old loved it and even managed to do most of it on his own (minus some of the scarier parts)."
3,It was good for the short period of time it covered,"I liked the way the book showed different case studies, starting with the designer's sketches, sitemaps, thoughts, and comments. The biggest problem with the book is that almost all the sites covered are in a style that has not aged well. These sites are mostly the Flash-based mini-sites that barely cover 1/3 of your screen, and are usually not very content heavy. I don't think that's the way sites are being built today, and in the future. So, really, while it's a nice looking book, it has little relevance to today."
2,Slightly dissapointed.,"Ordering and delivery of this product presented no problems. Also the price was OK. However, I ordered 5 of items and one was completely devoid of oil. I mean the sponge was dry. Hence the mediocre review."
1,NOT FOR MULTITRACK RECORDING,"For multitrack recording, this mic is useless. It shuts off all other sound coming from the computer. For multitrack recording, you need to listen to previously recorded tracks while adding more tracks. With this mic it is impossible. I have other USB mics that work just fine. Whoever designed this device was not real intelligent."
1,DOA - Was Bad,"I had a fuser error on my HP color laserjet 3500. After a lot of research I ordered this to replace my bad one. I'm very computer savvy and even build computers.I put the fuser in exactly as instructed. I turned the printer on and went to print my first page and got another fuser error message.I took my computer to the HP repair store in town. They said the fuser that's in it (this new one I bought) is bad, put a new one in and $300 later just for the HP center (plus the cost of this fuser) I have my HP 3500 working again.Unfortunately, I didn't get to repairing my HP until about 60 days after I purchased this fuser so I was past the 30 day refund period. That was my fault, otherwise I would've returned it."
3,A River With No Return,I really enjoyed this movies!! It was a exciting - thrill ride adventure with a twist.It had great actors; including Robert Urich and Joel Higgins ; akka Ricky Schroders dad on the 80's TV Series Silver Spoons.The movie had great scenery including rapid waters of the fraser river and back woods of the Oregon coast.This was a great Television made movie which should come out on DVD.
1,This book is terrible!,"This book is used by the Univ of Auckland for its stage 1 CS textbook and it won't be used next yr.As Java is a high level OOL, the authors did a very poor job in explaining even the very basic concept of OOP. (e.g. class, method, etc)"
1,This book SUCKS!,"I'm currently a Computer Science major at the University of Memphis and unfortunately they used this book for their Introduction to Computer Science class. Sad to say, I failed the class because this book failed me! There's only so much that a professor can explain and you will need a reliable text, well written, with lots of examples on java programming to supplement the lectures. However, this awful text does not explain the basics of programming but instead bombards you with Computer Science concepts that are way over a beginner's head. It was useless to all of students in the class and nearly everyone had to go out and buy a second book, like ""Headfirst Java"" by Kathy Sierra. However, after spending $108.00 on this book, I refused to go out and purchase another text. So as the semester progressed and the students who'd purchase a different book grasped the programming concepts, I still grappled with this garbage and ultimately failed the class. So BEWARE, THIS BOOK SUCKS!"
2,This book is simply terrible,"Don't buy this one if you are actually looking for a book that will teach you the ins and outs of programming with Java. Simple topics are explained so in-depth that it confuses the reader more than it helps. Conversely, complex topics are breezed through with little or no mention as to their inner workings. Its the perfect book for a college weed out course, though; confusing and lacking a point. The authors do not even bother to tell you that the Java Development Kit can be downloaded for free from the Sun web site. That might have helped!"
4,Enjoying the memories!!!!!,"I really bought this CD for one song - Alexander Beetle!!!!I remembered it from my 6th birthday (60 years ago) in A A Milne's book ""Now We Are Six"", and when Melanie put some chords to it I was immedialtely hooked!Having now listened to this CD a few times, that song is still the highlight for me, but she does put her all into her performance, and this is a good collection of her work. She possibly pushes a bit hard in concert, and that can throw her tuning a bit, but she can certainly sing, and some of her best tunes are here.Enjoy!"
4,Great low budget crime flick!,"The Dope Game was great, full of action, comedy and shootouts! It's about these two hired killers who decide to sell dope and transport it from Texas to California but at a pit stop the car full of drugs is stolen. They spend the next 90 minutes kicking ass and shooting anybody that gets in the way of there merchandise. Good job, great soundtrack Thanks!"
2,Dry!,This book is extremely boring and dry. I was required to buy it for a Masters level college course. I would not reccommend this book to anyone other than a student who is required to purchase it.Can't wait to sell it back to the college bookstore!
1,"Great comics, awful printing","Marvel really dropped the ball with this one. This volume contains some comics not seen since they were originally published, over fifty years ago. Unfortunately, the reproduction of the artwork in this volume is hideous. The artwork is splotchy and looks like it was xeroxed. It's too bad Marvel couldn't invest a little time and effort in this rare material like DC has done with their very high quality Archives. I'm giving this book one star just because of the scarcity of the material it contains. What a disappointment."
1,Don't spend money on this one.,"I saw this book at a book store and decided to check it out. I was considering buying it; however, my experience with comic reprints cautioned me to be wary of the quality of print. Unfortunately, this book is pathetic in its reproduction. The printing is so bad that it detracts from any enjoyment of these old comics. I had to abandon the whole idea of buying it. The bad far outweighed the good."
4,Great Case!,"Great case, fits well, works well.The bad: Only minor issues; poor wrist/neckstrap, the controls may be difficult for some with larger fingers."
5,"Books worthy of the title ""Graphic Novel""","Written by Hayao Miyazaki, the mastermind behind animated classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke"", this great work of the graphic art is NO MERE COMIC BOOK.Like most great graphic novels in the tradition of Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller, Nausicaa is often violent, complexly written, and in the end utterly provocative and meaningful.For those who can see past the comic-book exterior and peer into the soul of Nausicaa, a well-deserved adjective comes to mind - magnificent.Offer this to an acquaintance as a leisure-time read. If the art style manages to get them to bite the hook, the bulk of the story will surely reel them in.Hook. Line. Sinker."
4,"Handy for light duty, good price point","Purchased one of these to test lines at various facilites, it is not built as tough as other fluke gear, but does perform every task I need.This might be the handiest peice of equipment, DTMF tone detect and Caller ID and tone generator and allows you to talk over a dry pair. I can't think of anything else I want! And frankly I don't see the more durable models having all the features. I imagine the JDSU Ranger would be another good choice, but I do like the fluke name."
3,Work as a Spiritual Practice: A Practical Buddhist Approach,I bought this for my wife because she appreciates the Buddha and also is a workaholic that puts in 14 hours a day! Was hoping this might ease her off a bit but noooo. Now she goes in for a few hours for free on the weekends to catch up. If it were anyone else I would think she's going on an affair but I know different. She's just dedicated to her work helping the homeless families find shelter. But I digress. It came quickly and has a lot of words in it! But what do I know...I'm a materialist swine.
5,Clarifying,"This is an excellent book for those seeking to integrate spirituality into their workplace. It covers many common concerns and issues, but also leaves enough flexibility for the reader to adapt the content to their own situation. A good and easy read--I read it during breaks at work!"
5,Home Run,"The Publisher's Weekly review above pretty much misses the central thesis: Does Mike Houle want to live an assured life ""in the fairway"" or take his chances that he might ""drive out of bounds?"" It's classic risk/reward that we all face in our lives, written eloquently in a well told tale. The mini-stories within about the conflicted slugger Barry McMartin, the rules- bending Roger Cash, and the protaganist's father Gil Houle are rich and imaginative. Between the covers, this one is better than Shoeless Joe.[Incidently, I am a big Kinsella fan ever since he flew across the continent to appear at openning day of Pupque Park...a miniature replica of Fenway built by 2 enterprising high school boys in their backyard in Wayland, MA. A great day, Kinsella was the star of this Jimmy Fund event despite appearances by Spaceman Bill Lee and Rich Gedman. Thanks for coming,WPK!]"
4,Check which boat the writer was using,"My open tandem canoe group used Soggy Sneakers on an exporatory (for us)week long trip in Southern Oregon. We found that the ratings listed in the book varied considerably depending on wether the writer was a kayaker, rafter or open canoeist. When a rafter called it a Class II it was a very different thing from when an open canoe rated it Class II. We got skunked several times before we started looking at the boats the raters were using. An open canoes Class III is a rafter's Class I and a Kayakers Class II. Once we figured that out we found the book very useful."
4,Would be a great book for a child interested in Egyptian Hieroglyphics,"This would also make a great book for a child who is interested in Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Like I was during a part of my gradeschool years. The book's layout is simple, and would not be overwhelming, like a university level text book on actual Hieroglyphic usage would be. The book is loaded with pictures and guides to how to draw them. Some very basic understanding to the meaning of actual Hieroglyphics are also given."
5,We love Super Why!,"We love Super Why and all the episodes on this DVD. The stories entertain our 3 year old while teaching him letters and reading. We work on learning letters at home and this DVD helps reinforce what we teach our son. My only complaint is the large number of commercials on the DVD. I wish they would leave those out. Overall, a great purchase."
1,DISSAPOINTING,"This wordworld video was a disappointment. we own most of the other ones, and this has 2 rerun episodes and only 1 new episode. maybe i missed that in the item description, but I generally wouldn't expect them to have re-runs and sell them as new videos. my little 3 year old looked forward to this for a few months before it came, and was disappointed when we got it and she watched it. hope the next ones this summer that are coming out aren't such a waste.Wordworld is GREAT, this one was a disappointment."
4,"Great Vacuum, marred by design flaw","Really like this vacuum, it's powerful and does a great job on cleaning up the dirt. Only problem is with the design of the floor attachment hose. It is situated behind the cord depenser so that you must remove the cord completely from the back of the machine, then remove the attachment hose then replace the cord. Not very quick and easy.Besides that it's great!"
4,i LuV CHarMeD!,"Charmed iz my fave show ever! this wuz a good book, but i liked the other charmed books better. i think that they should include pix in the books so u sort of have a better idea of what the characters look like. the blurb on the book pretty much explains the story. i LuV CHarMeD! nicole :)"
5,Medieval Phoebe,"A story as fantastic and lively as can be. You can dive right into the times of Prudence, namesake of Prue's and daughter of Melinda Warren. Charmed fans will recognize the names. Those who do not: Get that book and read it! Even if the name Halliwell doesn't ring a bell NOW, you'll love the Charmed Ones after reading this book!"
1,Seriously?!? For how much?,"Just search for Halex Stick-Ums Toss Game (which looks to be the same thing for only $3-$4. You can also get these at Target for $5. These must be really, really good quality; otherwise, this is a toal rip-off."
3,Hard to find matching bottle caps,"These bottles are excellent for milk storage, and a good deal for the money. Dr. Brown's standard nipples fit very well in them. However, the bottle caps that cover the nipple (for traveling with a full bottle ready to nurse) from Dr. Brown's do *not* fit, and we've had a hell of a time finding bottle caps that do fit these bottles. By chance, someone gave us a Pigeon brand glass bottle, and the lid form that also fits on the Lansinoh bottles. I haven't found lids for sale on their own from Pigeon, and we haven't had any success with other brands yet. I don't want to order a whole extra set of travel bottles when part of the convenience of these storage bottles is that you can pull them straight from the freezer to thaw & nurse. Some of that convenience is definitely lost in the hassle of finding an appropriate travel cap.If I had it to do over, I'd invest in a better set of travel bottles (that fits together properly) and just use storage bags for freezing milk."
3,"Hello, who is this?","This album by Wesley Willis was recorded around 2000. It is billed as ""Wesley Willis and the Dragnews"", as many of his later albums are. But there isn't a band backing him up, the only musical accompaniment is from his keyboard. The songs sound like the songs on every other Wesley Willis album, but the subject matter is even more repetitive than usual. I mean, there are SIX songs about licking the private parts of animals! Anyway, it is still pretty enjoyable if you are a fan of Wesley."
1,They messed up the order,"The retailer butchered my order, sending me all one size instead of assorted sizes. Buyer beware. I'll buy them at the store next time."
5,2nd Review,I think my Grandma loved this present! She had just gotten her a DVD player so I wanted to make sure she had a good movie to watch on it.
5,Must See Movie,"I was raised in the south during the 1950s and this movie really captures the spirit of the times. If you are expecting a comedy, it has a few very funny moments, but this is a dramatic movie saturated in realism."
5,Excellent drama,Great movie. My husband and I enjoyed immensely. It's a poignant story with excellent real life drama. Really brings history to life.
5,The Help. Totally Oscar worthy..,"Ok, first of all, I just have to say that in some point during this movie, my dad cried. I, however, controlled my tears, although they were threatening to fall. ""The Help"" is a hilarious, inspiring, makes-you-want-to-get-up-and-do-something film. After watching the movie, I ran on over to the book store and bought, and read, the book. LOVE IT! Emma Stone leads this film as Skeeter, a young (white) women with a college degree and her heart set on becoming a journalist, in Mississippi during a time that strongly encouraged segregation. Her friends are all extremely anti-African while they go along trying to raise money for the starving children of Africa (IRONIC!). Skeeter must chose between her ""friends"" and the one she loves, and her career and what she knows is right.RENT IT, WATCH IT, BUY IT NOW!!!"
1,not,"Seems every year there is a movie that is loved and nominated for awards that I just don't get.This year it's The Help.Too long for one thing ;wrongheaded and not funny.Other than that the performances are good and it has lots of production values. I just can't get my head around a movie that says its ok to put your own excrement in someone's food if you think you may have been treated unfairly in some way.Most of the white ladies in the movie are cartoon charactors ,more out of the simpsons than reality.Oh well what do i know?But putting your own fecal matter in someone's pie????????????"
2,Took Lord's name in vain!,"This movie could have been great but in the first two minutes it took the Lord's name in vain. As in it said ""G..D...."" If they would have took that out, I would like it. If you do not find cursing then you would most likely love it."
3,"While true to the book, still falls flat.","The movie is very true to the book. They leave out very few details, and don't take any liberties, as most movies don't. The only problem is that the movie drags. Details that are shared in narration (what happened to Treelore, his story, the story of Johnny and Celia, etc) aren't included in the movie, and I feel like the movie needs them. If you were reading the book you could stop and go when you please, not sit through a whole movie that gets sort of dull at moments.The book is more interesting, thorough, and exciting."
1,Help ME,"This movie must have been made for the acidic Chardonnay sipping crowd with that lifelong dream of acceptance into their local Bridge club. It's a movie about nothing more than the day to day existence of some white women and their black maids. How creative, and so what's the point."
1,defective DVD,The HELP DVD only I purchased will only play half way through then cuts outso infact is defective .
4,Great Movie,"My first thought was this would be one of those slow / nap time 'chick-flicks' movies that I'll not like. I was wrong! I can't count the times I laugh, felt sad, and reminisce on the area where I grew up. I highly recommend this movie."
3,An OK Movie,"This movie was an OK movie. I wouldn't watch this a second time and some of the products they used were from our time (Ex. Swimming pool with a slide, 12-digit telephone, glass coca-cola bottle, etc)."
1,Boring,Most boring movie I've ever watched. Couldn't get through the whole thing despite some fast forwards. I think slavery was a crime but still this movie was way overhyped.
2,The Help DVD,DVD skips and doesn't work properly. I have asked twice now for a replacement. No response.I would like a working DVD! Make it happen.
2,Lousy and saccharine,"All of the black characters are saints and all but one White are jerks or worse. Evidently the book is much better, but I doubt that reality played much of a part in it either."
1,Why did so many people like the movie?,"This movie was such disappointing execution of a great book. It was as if the screenwriters didn't know they'd have to leave something out of the movie. Felt like ALL the characters got short shrift and, in some cases, were not represented as they were in the book.I think most of the actors did a great job with their parts but their parts paled compared to the book versions of them. It made me mad to see this win awards."
2,Does not do the book justice,"I watched ""The Help"" last night. Boy was the a waste of 2 hours of my life i will never get back. I really enjoyed the book, probably one of the most amazing books i have ever read, and I was really hoping the movie would be just as amazing. Well i was very disappointed. For one they changed things in the movie that were important parts in the book. If you love this movie that is because you haven't read the book. Please do yourself the favor and read the book"
5,Love,"I absolutely love the book 'the help' and i equally love the movie. I felt that the movie stayed true to the novel and I loved how the characters where acted. There is nothing I could really critique. I highly recommend this movie/book. Just a side point: I am from the South and I understand the dialect. However I live in Australia now and my Aussie friends had a hard time understanding the accent. So if you have a hard time understanding the southern accent, make sure to turn the volume up real good, because you don't want to miss a word that these beautiful ladies have to say."
5,I love it,Butt it do's seem like it's a long play but i can still relate to it I'm watching I'm watching it for the second time i went to sleep on it the fist time around i just got today as well
5,The Help,This is my favorite book. The story tells of a shameful time in American History but the characters bring hope and life and fun. This book is very well written and captures your heart from the very beginning. I LOVE IT!
2,Just ok,"Another movie that looked much better in the movie trailers then the actual movie was. I was very disappointed in this movie. Dont get me wrong it was an ok movie, I just expected alot more from it."
5,Deeply inspiring...,"Ten stars are too few! I have watched this video 5 or 6 times now and still feel deeply inspired by it each time. I haven't read the book, and usually I find movies adapted from books to come up way short. But I can't imagine the book being any more remarkable or profound than this performance is. The acting is truly outstanding and the story told long overdue. Bravo and thank you to all who had a hand in it."
5,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE WITH ACADEMY AWARD WORTHY PERFORMANCES,"It was INTERESTING to read the reviews for this movie. Some gave poor reviews saying it it was not anywhere as good as the book. I did not read the book, but that makes no sense to me. I know a good movie when I see one. The movie should be reviewed on it's own merit. Some argued the racial issues were overblown or nonexistent. I know that argument is invalid. So what is it about this movie that provokes so much defensiveness and need to dissect and inject personal perspective?This is a movie. It is a work of fiction (despite the fact that there are issues that were/are real). I found this movie to be compelling and the acting, by all actors for the most part, to be very good to EXCELLENT. I SAY BRAVO. JOB WELL DONE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie for it's presentation, content, and, especially, it's superb performances."
3,Great for Beginners,"As soon as my daughter saw them (20 months) she loved them. She started grabbing them off the table looking through the one's she would grab. They're perfect for tiny hands. She even used them to stack one on top of the other. Bright colors with well known kids jr cast at a Great price! The only problem was I ordered a new one BUT I got a used one! The box they came in was already opened and 5 of the books were OBVIOUSLY used, though there were some new ones. I decided to keep it just because the shipping and handling back and forth is not worth it. That's why I gave it 3 stars (I would have given it 5 stars)"
3,Pillow or couch?,"This book is fun to read and explore. It bears reading two or three times, and is filled with some good insights into parallels between buddisht practice and western psychology. Having said that, it is also fair to say that it is in need some serious editing and rethinking. Misstatememts like: ""Buddhism has always made the self's ability to relax its boundaries the centerpiece of its teachings"" are indicative of the authors' predeliction for interpreting buddhist philosophy in western psychological terms. And this is a real weakness of the text.It also troubles me that the author himself, along with several of his aquaintances and patients, practiced most fertily in the ground of buddhist meditation, and yet the author seems to take pains to avoid suggesting that this is indeed the most appropriate advice for those suffering."
3,Mental Mantra,"Epstein is so facile and disciplined in the art of deconstructing Eastern and Western thought that he is free of the constraints of any cognitive anxiety incumbant to the marriage of these philosophical contexts. Not always so for the reader.To find the pieces of Dr. Epstein's deep convictions without falling apart, it is best to resist the temptation to dwell too deeply on every thought, and avoid the frustration that comes when you first realize that this is not a ""how to"" book. Nonetheless, it is a fine background piece for integrating traditional Western psychological theory (and Eastern religion) into a Bhuddist (Zen) perspective, while addiing a dash of cognitive behaviorism for good measure.I think the appeal is primarily to professionals, because, absent some background in Western psychological theory, it may well be jabborwocky.Nonetheless, I found it interesting and thought provoking. I am currently looking for a Zen Master to help me unravel the toxic strings that bind me."
4,Great kids' clock radio,"This is a great kids' clock radio - my 5-yr old son loves it. We have had it for several weeks now and it seems well-made. I also like the ""upright"" profile b/c it takes up less room on his small nightstand than his old one - we're happy with our purchase."
4,"Looks cool, cheap motor","This clock is a great idea and I wish I could rate it higher. Assembled easily and looks very interesting. However within (2) days of running the bottom motor started clicking and going out sporadically, and then burned out completely. The motors just seem very cheap & feeble. I emailed Kikkerland just to see if I could order a better motor somewhere, so I could have the clock working; still waiting for reply.I will try to return for a replacement but I fear the new one will break down down the road, too. Most clocks people have decades, some even get passed down to children, I regret this one doesn't appear to be built to last anywhere near this long. I suppose time will tell.2/16 UPDATE I'm bumping this one up to 4. I got mailed a replacement and its been about 2 weeks, and the clock is running fine, aside from sticking once (I gave it a tap and it started up again). It is very asthetic.Could be the first one was just a defective."
2,Great looks don't make up for cheap quality,"First off, I have to say this wall clock was easy to assemble and it does look great. However it does not make up for the fact it is manufactured almost entirely of plastic and as a result suffers from poor quality. After running for one day, this clock is already 2.5 hours fast and there was a major crack in one of the gears"
5,Eccentric Conversation Clock,"This clock may be too eccentric actually. My wife wouldn't let me hang it in the living room, so it resides in my office. The funny thing is that everyone that sees it loves it. Maybe some day she'll change her mind. But for now, the clock is working perfectly, keeps time (as one would hope). Up close (real close) you can see the seams between the 4 pieces that make up the big wheel. And yes, they WHOLE thing is plastic; but you can't really tell unless your right up on it. Would I buy it if I could do it all over again? Yes! Would my wife let me? Maybe if there was a new purse in it for her ;o)"
3,Vague Character Development,"This was not a bad read as it kept my attention. George Clasby, the rake who wishes to reform via help from the well thought of Miss Harriet Whitlow, was some sort of gigolo, I think. That is my issue with this story. Was he a gigolo? Seems that way but the author does not really clarify that point. Also, where is his family? He has his own estate but with him being a Mr. and allowed to Almack's there must be some noble blood in him but from where? He must have a sibling who is a Lord of something. Why the vagueness? I did not read the first two stories based with these characters, so maybe it is in them but all stories should be stand alone. Also, why in the world would Harriet's father give permission for a rake to have a pretend association with his daughter? I mean, George was using Harriet any way you slice it. Why would he help George??"
5,"I Don't Hate to Read, But this Book Rocks!!","When I first saw this book, I just knew I would love it. I am a HUGE reader, and there's no way I hate to read. But I liked this book anyway. You will find 125 books in here, which will appeal to reluctant readers. I've read several of the books featured in this book, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every single one of them. There are several parts to the book: books for 5-8 years old, books for 7-10 years old, books for 8-12 years old, and books for ages 10 and up. Each book featured has a picture, an exerpt from the book, a summery of the book, reasons why the book would appeal to reluctant readers, who might like it, types of illustrations, and so much more. There are even more reccomended books in the back. This is truly a fantastic resource, whethere you hate to read or not."
5,The most anticipated expansion ever!,This is and may very well be always the best mmorpg. The expansion will only make it better and the collectors edition just cant be toped. This is a must have for anyone who plays mmos.
5,Nine is a true MC !!!!,Nine builds his record by applying hiphop's fundamentals of bringing harmony between beats and lyrics. He rhymes with skill and is some one who has drunk deep from the well of rap. His raspy vocals add phat lyrics make this a gem for lovers of rap. A true MC who has mastered his art
3,really?,"I disagree that they're heavy duty shoes. Quite the opposite I would say. They're thin soled with a slim profile (compared to normal fatty skate shoes of course). I'm a huge fan of the thinner tongue and the short break in time. That being said, they're not that durable both in terms of skating and regular wear and tear. The sole splits fairly easily (started the first time I wore them) and my friend's AL50 only lasted him 3 weeks of skating. Also I'm a sucker for lace protectors, and since these don't have them, prepare to rip through lots of laces. Another way they can improve it is by adding a gel insert under the heel to improve the cushioning of these thin soled kicks. Ultimately, they are well priced, good looking and comfortable shoes. But if you're looking for a similar but more durable skateshoes, I recommend the C1RCA 208 vulcs since they don't have all the short comings I've mentioned above."
3,It was OK.,"A cute enough little tale.Recently widowed woman meets the grandson of the toy store santa (an aging ham actor) after Santa promises her young son *everything* on his Christmas list. The young widow is obviously dismayed by this promise, since she's not made of money; the kid is keeping mum about what's on his list!The grandson (a hunky world-famous journalist, of course) is smitten and tries to help her out. Adorable hilarity ensues. Well, OK, there's not really that much hilarity, and it's not all that adorable, but it's nice enough."
4,Good old fashion fun!,"Okay, if you are looking for a challenge, then this isn't the game for you. But, if you are looking to have some fun then this is a great game to own, especially for the price. The old arcade style action shooter brings back great gaming memories. The game is easy to beat, and the story is TOTALLY cheesy, but the graphics are nice and the gameplay is really fun. A downside to the game is that it doesn't have 2 player in story mode, which I thought was pretty lame. Overall, I am pleased with Space Raiders."
4,Title For Review...,"CD 1 is fantastic. A great introduction to latin music. There are some fabulous tracks incl. Nem Vem Que Nao Tem the irresistably funky tune from city of god and of course the ikea ad. The album covers a wide range and demonstrates the fabulous sense of rhythm that this type of music is almost defined by, not to mention the wonderful timbre of the instruments. I most enjoyed brazillian takes on styles such as jazz, club tracks and even drum and bass. Buy this CD: broaden your musical horizons in the most enjoyable and funky way."
5,good investment,"If u don't feed ur pup a good dog food. u will pay for it later,in vet bills. this is worth a few extra bucks, and still, not as pricey as soom others."
2,Uncomfortable and My Grandkids Said They Were Ugly,"I really wouldn't care if they were ugly if they felt good but they don't. They are tight around the instep, around my toes (the shoe's not too short, just tight around the toes), and at the band across the top. Even though the feel cushiony when you put them on, the sole doesn't provide much support.The reason I ordered them was because they were the right color, the reviews were good, and I have a history of excellent shoes purchased from FootSmart. This pair just didn't work for me.It it wasn't going to cost $8.49 to return them, I would return them. Instead I'll try wearing them with silky socks and see if they stretch any.* Addendum: I've been wearing these occasionally for four months and they are still so uncomfortable that I take them off as soon as I get to work. Maybe Goodwill will like them."
3,"Nice shoes, but NOT for anyone w/plantar fasciitis/heel pain.","UPDATED REVIEW: I do NOT recommend these shoes if you have plantar fasciitis (heel pain), as they worsen the condition for me. I'm disappointed, since I bought a second pair based on my initial use/review, but ultimately found that after wearing these shoes my heel pain is much worse. If no heel pain -- go for it, they are attractive and comfortable unless you have this issue.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been wearing these shoes for a couple months now, and really like them. They are wearing very well so far. The only issue I've noticed so far is that the heel strap doesn't have a very long strip of Velcro, so I recommend that you don't buy them larger than your usual size or else you may not be able to keep them tight enough on your heel. They weren't quite as 'cushy' as I had hoped, given the cost of the shoes, but I got them on sale and wear them at least 3 days a week & they're holding up well, so they are well worth the cost for me."
2,Disney clock,"Cute little clock with nice buzz lightyear alarm sounds. Unfortunately very difficult to use. I find it very confusing and I'm a technology loving adult. Obviously didn't have kids in mind when designing the layout. Unless your child is a huge Buzz lightyear fan, my recommendation is to stay away from this one."
3,Ok scale,"I agree with the review where the person states they drank an 8oz glass of water and should have gained 1/2 lbs, but the scale ""remembered"" the previous weight and displayed that. It truly does ""remember"" the last weight displayed and displays it again if the next reading is within a few pounds of the previous one. To get a fresh reading you have to reset the saved value by weighing something that is substantially different than the last weight. I often ""calibrate"" the scale by pushing on my towel rack for a higher weight when I'm on the scale, and then getting off and weighing myself. Even then, it can vary within a pound. It's accurate within a certain range (couple pounds), but certainly not to .2 lbs like it pretends."
1,Save yourself the trouble,"I bought this from bed bath and beyond, they replace the first after one day (error message), the second after one month and after less than a year, the third is broken. Once the battery ran out, i changed the battery and the scale refused to start. I opened the scale and the inside was badly rusted from water penetration. Clearly this piece of equipment is not fit for purpose. A bathroom scale should be impervious to water as you step on it after a bath or shower. While the company has agreed to replace, i must pay the shipping charges, so I am faced with paying another $15 for a piece of junk. One star is a generous description of my review of this scale. Save yourself the trouble and buy something alse."
4,Good scale.,I don't really know how much I can say about a scale. It weighs properly and matches my bathroom tiles. Hoo. Ray.
4,A Good Camera with A Good Price,"I bought this camera after I gave away a Sony one. In all fairness, the one I purchased through Amazon is really a better choice in terms of price and quality. How easy to use this camera is really beyond my expectations, and so my wife and I now shoot a lot with it. In short, you won't complain about this camera."
1,Nice design - but watch for quality issues,"This unit is a very nice design. The two displays are connected with a single cable, making for an easy setup. Each display attaches to a velcro-strapped backplate that stays on the car headrest. The displays quickly and easily pop off so you can take them inside when not needed in the car - of if the kids want to watch movies in the hotel! The audio is loud enough, and the video bright enough to keep the kids entertained on a long trip.The problem is in the quality. Our main unit stopped working after only a week. It was not dropped or damaged in any way - it just refused to power up. And without the main unit, the slave display is virtually useless. Another caution: the warranty is only 90 days!I was concerned about purchasing an RCA product after Thompson Consumer Electronics stiffed millions of TV buyers in the 90's with the ""Tuner on Board"" failures. Apparently, it's still cheaper to litigate away class action lawsuits than build a reliable product."
1,I will NEVER buy RCA again - EVER,"This completely died after a few months. We sent it in to the warranty work company, figured we would give it a try instead of being out $175. Well sending it to TX was like donating it to charity involuntarily. We call and we call and we call, get to talk to people in India who read a script, we no longer support this product. Or my favorite, the person who told us what we wanted to hear . We gave them the Fedex Ground tracking # to prove delivery, they said, someone will contact you within 48 hours , that was 3 weeks ago. Big rip off. We would have kept it ourselves and popped open the seals and fiddled with it some - if we would have known they were just going to steal it from us. Sworn off of RCA for life and will tell everyone i know to never buy their products."
3,pollen cream,I bought this product because of the high reviews. The cream smells nice and feels good but I am not really sure that it helps to lessen the appearance of wrinkles. Maybe I just don't apply it often enough or it takes a while?
3,Slightly Better than Mediocre,"This product was probably the best in its category and accomplished the job just enough to be acceptable. We used it on a 50"" Panasonic plasma and it worked OK, but there was no way whatsoever to get the image to fill the entire screen. I think devices that are $500+ might accomplish filling the entire screen. To spend any more money on the task, it might make more sense to buy a compact workstation computer system with a DVI port that is HDMI compatible so you have a native picture fills your your screen."
5,Fantastic,"We love this book (3 1/2 year old). The commands are fun - explore your teeth, stick out your tongue. It has a few ideas for further activities in the back. Today we made a ""nose book"" all about the sense of smell, and an ""eye book"" about sight. Excellent series with great pictures and simple explanations. Your nose is your smelling machine - great stuff. Giraffes have tongues long enough to reach into their ears!"
4,good vibrations,the home medic massager is wonderful for sore back and shoulder muscles. it's soft little feet make it oh so comfortable to the touch.
2,Sebago boat shoes,"I have worn Sebago boat shoes for most of my life, and ordered these because the are available in 3E width. The shoe seems well made, and has excellent soles. One major drawback however is that the innersole makes my feet smell like they have died. I have had to replace the innersole with another, which has helped though not eliminated this issue.Fit is good and shoes are comfortable."
5,"Nice, comfy, sturdy shoe","I gave these to my boyfriend as a gift and he loves them! They are more comfortable (he says) and wider than Sperry's. True to size & good for people with a ""wider"" foot. Very stylish too."
4,Clovehitch,"These are my favorite shoes. I got these to replace a 5 yr old, worn out pair..and so far they are great."
2,Sizing is wrong,"I bought a Sebago Clovehitch II because the Sperry Billfish was just getting too expensive. Unfortunately the sizing is all wrong on Sebagos. I went to a shoe retailer to try on Sebagos and Sperry's and Sperry's are true to size while Sebagos are huge. At the store we held up one of each that looked the same size heel to toe to compare: the Sebago size 8M matched the Sperry size 10M! How that happens is beyond me. I've always worn 8M in Sperry's and have no idea what size to get in Sebago, which makes it impossible to buy online. I already returned 2 pairs to Amazon..."
5,Great,Great product. Quick delivery. Quality shoes at a very fair price. I would recommend these shoes to anybody looking for quality boat shoes.
1,A poor copy,Shame on you all for writing and publishing this book. Why can't you come up with an original idea instead of trying to copy Goldratt's THE GOAL? Mr. Jacobs your no Eli Goldratt. And as for McGraw-Hill-What kind of bottom feeding is this for a company of your stature. The reason THE GOAL works is that it presents new ideas. It's the content stupid!
5,Quite good book,"Thanks to my ancient greek teacher Carine, I have found a great interest in this book. It's a shame there isn't more philosophy in it."
2,NOT 3.5 x 5,These pockets are 4 x 5.5. The photos it boasts it holds slip around and look sloppy. Other companies offer smaller 4 pocket pages that work.
5,Principios de anatomia y fisiologia,"Este libro abarca todos los aspectos del ser humanano en cuanto a las funciones del cuerpo y su desarrollo. No informa de las diferentes clasificaciones del cuerpo, sus partes. El como se debe estudiar el cuerpo humano. Nos orienta y explica de forma clara, correcta y precisa. Nos brinda preguntas y formatos de trabajos para mayor entendimiento."
5,Older is still better,"It's great to here some of the best music in a long time , Yes there is a few good tunes once n awhile but back then A R A was great and refereshing from the standard stuff. Spent many a day fishing the keni river for salmon with A.R.A. plugged into my ears. Thanks for the memories."
2,Doesn't Zig or Zag much at all,"This zig n zag ball, from what i can remember from the advertising, claimed to have self-propelled zig/zag action. All it really has is a weighted ball inside a larger plastic ball, which occasionally causes the larger ball to veer off course.However, it does not zig or zag for very long, either on carpeting (which the instructions suggest against) or hardwood floor (so if it works great on marble or perhaps concrete, i don't know)I found that if you get the inner ball rolling inside before you let the big ball loose, the zig n zag action is more pronounced, but still not very exciting.However, because of the inner ball, it makes a noise that attracts my cat to it, who uses it anyways.However, it just didn't live up to what was promised."
5,Palm Metal Case,This case is the best way to protect your Palm and keep it clean. The center spine affixes the Palm to the case so there is no worry about it falling out and the little pockets house SD cards for the Palm like the SD card for Palm Scrabble. Get a great metal case.
5,great product,"The item is just what i wanted and the company was even better to deal with. I misread the ad and ordered the wrong case and didn't catch it untill it showed up and they exchanged it for me with no problems. I am very happy with the case it fits and protects the palm very well and allows me to use, charge and beam to the palm without removing it from the case. Extremlly happy with the product."
4,Okie,"I bought this along with a double din cd player and the player would not fit inside like it should have.The cd player was a couple millimeters too big.I had to shave the inside corners with a knife , and squeeze my player in and flush.With this being said i guess not all double dins are made alike.And i have a 2007 chevy aveo so this fits the 07 and 08'S too"
5,Best Series,This show has me hooked. I didn't start watching faithfully until the third season and now I am downloading old episodes. The chemistry that the cast has created is unique and captivating. The Southern mix and LA attitude is humorous and very accurate. I think TNT has a winner with this show.
3,"Good for the price, hard on the hand!!!","I've had this product for about a week now. And I have been using it everyday on my boyfriend who has back pain. For the price it's perfect. It has different heads that you can use on different parts of the back, and part of the handle adjusts to the motion (kind of like in some tooth brushes). He loves it and the heat is also a nice feature.The reason why I gave it 3 starts, it's because of the vibration given out by the massager, my hand gets a funny sensation, it's not too pleasant. The same applies if you're massaging yourself. So my recommendation have someone do it for you, so you can relax and enjoy.So in general for the price of 16 bucks it's a good product to have."
2,change sorter,"It's very cheaply made and you have to put the rolls over the change after the money is sorted, which can be difficult at times. Likely the wiring will be bad."
1,Don't sort your coins with this gimmick,"I purchased this for about $20.00. And I followed the directions carefully. Despite that, a coin slipped into the mechanism. There was no way to remove it, even though I tried that as carefully as possible.I threw the device in the trash. I did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins, and I now separate coins by hand. The advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins, so you avoid counting them."
5,Wonderful bedtime book for toddlers,"My son (now age 3) has loved this book for 6 months, as have we. It is a sweet, unusual story illustrated in the same colorful, enchanting way that all of Eric Carle's books are. In looking at a few reviews by others I was floored to read that some took exception to the illsutration of the nude couple or felt it necesitated a warning; my husband and I never thought twice about showing that image to our little son, and our son certainly isn't bothered by it in any way. In any event, I hope parents won't be too startled at the thought of a single page containing discreet nudity to consider sharing this book with their children - it would be a terrible shame if they did. This is a delightful book for bedtime."
5,sterling silver eternal celtic knot w/ sapphire,"This is a lovely piece, even prettier than the pictures showed, and I am very happy with it."
1,"For show, not play","Ladies & gentlemen, boys & girls,It was figured out long ago that these little cars are more for show than to play with. Has anyone checked the prices of vintage Matchbox cars from the 60s' for example? If I hadn't been stupid and sold my collection of cars when I was 25 I'd be quite well to do by now. If you allow these or any small die cast car to be played with, they will break and then you will have junk.To any young adult I suggest to you to start collecting Matchbox and Hot Wheel cars now, leave them in their boxes, wrappers or whatever and wait 25 to 30 years. You may be able to retire early."
1,Had to return shorts,I bought a black pair of these shorts for working out and jogging. Boy was I surprised with the poor quality when they showed up. The stitching on the waistband was all loose and where the drawstring comes out there was a big rip. I think I will stick to the Reebok jersey shorts from now on.
3,"For Heavens Sake, They're Gym Shorts","They fit, they're comfortable, they are the cotton shorts I've been looking for. Material is a bit thin, but what do you expect for $8."
3,Just what I expected,"I guess the worst part of looking for shorts that are comfortable enough to sleep in and have pockets is that they aren't made for women. (Note the criteria of ""comfortable to sleep in.) Other than looking like a 12-year-old boy, they are perfect and just what I expected."
4,son like it,"I purchsed this pants for my son. He says it is very comfortable. The length is just right.I purchased the navy, and the color is very nice.He intends to purchase the other colors."
2,"Sorry, it didn't do anything for me","Not knowing anything about this album, I bought it pretty much based on the good reviews here. I only listened to it twice after getting it. I love trance/dance music but this just wasn't my cup of tea. The songs seemed uninteresting. Just nothing special IMO. That happens. It wasn't obnoxious, so maybe you'll get lucky and like it more than I did. 2 - 2 1/2 stars."
3,Drill sharpening experience,I bought one several years ago and sharpened several hundred drills. A lot of the drills were the slow spiral type that I was not able to sharpen on my older model Drill Doctor. It did wear out and it not suited for real heavy shop use but is fine for the casual user.
5,Nice thermostat,I use this thermostat to control the heat mat under my leopard gecko terrarium. It's easy to operate and does the job very well. I am 100 percent satisfied with this purchase.
4,on off temp. switch,Love the digital part.Good temperture probe.It can be used to run more than one item.The price didn't seem to bad.
4,Good Product -- Good price,"After careful consideration and reviewing many seed catalogs, (that sell this item and other thermostats), I found the price on Amazon was MUCH better than other locations.I have just started using the product, but, find it works as advertised. It has generally good reviews and that helped sell the product to me."
3,Control set point only changes in 1 degree increments,"I'm using this controller for a heater in my sensory deprivation tank so that I can maintain the proper temperature while floating. The packaging for this item says it controls in increments of 0.1. However, it only controls in increments of 1. Fortunately, for my application it has proved to be satisfactory."
1,wring dangerous - buyer beware,I have a beauty salon and purchased this item to use on my manicure client's. As I have all my equipment inspected annually I was made aware that the wiring on this item is very dodgy and dangerous. I would not recommend anyone purchase this item as it is poorly designed.
1,do not buy this item!!!!,"We bought this item for our two year old daughter. She loved it, it's very cute and the buttons are easy for her to use. It quit working about a month after we bought it. The radio works fine but won't play cd's. At first the cd player would get stuck in the middle of a song and then it just quit reading them. The biggest waist of money! From what I've read about the other Disney Princess items, they all do the same thing. They just quit working. Save your money, buy something else!!!!"
4,Disney Boombox,I bought the Disney Boombox for my daughter for her 9th birthday. She loves the Disney style and the facted that she can use headpones with it. We found it to be a good value for the price.
2,An awful and amateurish waste,"I watched this movie only because Chris Plummer got the Oscar for it. And I realized that he got it because it was long overdue. But this great American actor can't rescue this awful, amateurish, boring film. His own role in it is minimal, and requires few of his range of talents. The filmmaker appears not to know how to put together a movie except as a pastiche of clever but repetitive slide shows, screen tricks, voiceovers, a mugging dog, mooning faces, an absurdly miscast and misdirected Goran Visnjic, tinkly piano music, arbitrary scenes irrelevant to the story, and random flashbacks. The boy-girl love story is completely unbelievable and distracts from any true feeling the movie intended. It's got to be one of Plummer's worst career choices, since his coming out and his character are 2-dimensional at best, and are never dramatized. What a waste."
3,The dog is adorable,"I thought the ""conversations"" between the main character (Oliver) and the dog (Arthur) he takes in were cute. I found it to be the most upbeat part of the movie. Maybe its just me, but I found this movie to be kinda sad and depressing. From the scenes of Oliver's unhappy childhood to his dealing with his father's slow death from cancer, his failed relationships & inability to be happy with his friends, etc. it was a little difficult to watch. I think what made it especially hard was that it all seemed to move so slowly. Not a bad movie, but not one I'd want to watch over and over."
4,pretty awesome,Everything was in order as I had originally intended it to.The shipment arrived promptly and onions were chopped once again aswe watched the lovely movie.
2,A biased policy paper,As a parent of an exceptionally gifted child I found many of the resources listed in this book to be helpful but thought that the text was very biased and confrontational.
5,Arresting music,"Sean Costello is the best new guitarist I've heard in years. His versatlity and creativity are amazing for such a young artist. I predict great things for him, and can't wait for his new album to come out."
3,Reasonably happy,"For the most part, I am satisfied with this product. Its just the little things that keep cropping up that annoy me.1) The spare handle (not the carrying strap) is secured by a screw and a washer. And if the screw comes loose there is not enough room to easily reattach it. After some work, it did go back into place.2) The opposite side of where the flap hangs on the bag is a large patch of fabric mesh. That has started to get worn and fray a little just from the bag rubbing against myself and other things.Other than these two things,1) It is extremely comfortable. Most bags hit me too high and thus feel awkward. This one is exactly the right length of strap.2) My laptop fits nicely into the compartment and leaves enough room for me to bring notebooks and maybe a small book or two.Overall, I'm happy but not ecstatic."
2,A few cardsa re worth it,"I could never do a reading with this deck--not just because it could be a little distracting, but also because the images are skewed. The Lovers, the Wheel, the Intiative (High Priestess), and a few other individual cards are worth the price just for the images themselves. However, the re-interpretation of some of the images (the Sun card depicts two old men, not a child ona horse) will bother many readers."
2,disappointed,"I am not professional groomer or looking to be one just clip and groom my poodle. This is for a professional, show dog groom and clip. Title is deceiving and condition worse than stated. I thru away."
5,"there best cd, second to none","its a cover cd, (1) No Wonder [sick n tired] (2) I Like Young Girls [the queers] (3) Leaving Home [digger] (4) Double Fisted [the gotohells] (5) C Biscuit [jugheads revenge] (6) Tonight [the automatics] (7) Six Down [pinhead circus] (8) Best Hung Carrot [chixdiggit] (9) Monster Zero [the queers] (10) Die Tonight [the gotohells] (11) High Balls [guttermouth] (12) I've Been Everywhere [johnny cash]"
2,Eh....,Not current with the times anymore. This books should be updated with more modern techniques and photos to bring up to date.
2,Don't buy this book.,"I bought this book before I found out the Author,Gabe Saurez,plead guilty to fraud. A quick internet search provided the following:""A former Santa Monica police officer has pleaded guilty to Workers Compensation fraud, money laundering and grand theft and will begin serving a year-long jail sentence for the crimes next week.Gabriel Saurez, a decorated 12-year veteran of the SMPD, will report to Los Angeles County Jail to begin serving his sentence on Monday as part of a plea agreement reached last week in Los Angeles County Criminal Court.""DO NOT buy this book. Better info can be had elsewhere,by authors who are NOT FRAUDS."
4,A must have,"I found it to be a very helpful book. Maybe not for the beginner but a must have among serious shooters. It is not the definitive book on the subject but one of the best, very good reading."
3,For the trained looking for drills,If you have had some training before in tactical marksmanship this will be a good book with some drills and such that will help you. The problem for the newbie is that physical skills are not taught well by text they are taught by doing. If you are not a trained shooter get some training first. Until then you are better off spending the money on ammo and training.
1,What I Learned About Shooting At The Police Academy,"The contents of this book are largely lifted from Police training manuals, and are not suited for the average citizen, unless you happen to be in a militia or you are a member of Al-Queda. I can't imagine why ordinary gun-enthusiasts would be interested in combat with fellow citizens, clearing and entering houses with hostile foes, and all the other techniques on offer here. Suarez makes a big deal about how he is a decorated officer, but no police officer worth their salt would put out books teaching citizens to be members of a tactical SWAT team.The author obviously isn't a police officer in good standing anymore because no commanding officer would permit someone to profit off the tactics presented here.If you are a gun-enthusiast, you would be better off buying something by John Farnam or Andy Stanford. Their books are written for citizen gun owners, and they don't teach how to indiscriminately kill people."
4,good product,"product is as expected. they did claim capacity was 70 oz, but 64 oz is all it reasonably holds, which is what I wanted anyway"
1,Very Expensive .99 cent Pitcher,"I guess I failed to realize it was plastic, and small. Not even good for a vase. Useless."
2,Not an Exciting Magnetic Board,"The set is very average. Only about 5 pieces - very large characters on a small, plain board."
5,Every Street Fighter fan should have this!,Is pretty nice story with Cammy! I will not spoil anything but I can say I like it a lot. I enjoy every street fighter comic/manga and this is no exception!
5,flyboys,this is a must for any world war 2 buff.i had never heard about this battle.put your self in those boys shoes as you listen.sent chills down my spine.we can never thank our vets enough.
2,"Very disappointing, misleading title","A few months ago, I overheard an argument by two people over this book, so I figured I would read it myself to see what it was really like. I must say I was very disappointed. The first few chapters are not even about World War II. The title is misleading, for it is not really about ""Flyboys"", and the author uses it as a platform to condemn the use of airpower. Unfortunately, civilians were killed in bombing raids, but it should be remembered that it was the Germans and the Japanese who started this war. The author also sees very little, if any, difference, between the Americans and Japanese, yet he overlooks who rebuilt Japan. If Japan had defeated the US, would they have rebuilt our cities? I highly doubt. There are better books about World War II in the Pacific, and certainly better books that portray the courage of the American Fighting Man."
4,These stories need to be told.,"For those of us that have never experienced battle it is inconceivable that humans can act the way they do. James Bradley, through the eyes of those that where there, paints a picture that I am sure most will deny, but I can picture myself being there and at the same time glad I wasn't. Although no one in my immediate family has been in the military several of my uncles served in WWII and none of them ever talked about their experiences, their accounts of history forever lost. I am glad Bradley undertook the task of writing this book, these stories need to be told and everyone needs to read them."
1,Disappointing.....,"I think he documented the stuggle of the downed airmen and the Japanese captors very well. I don't think his comparisons of American and Japanese expansion are accurate or valid. It becomes very clear very quickly this author has a ""pro-Japanese"" view of the world, vivid in his blurb at the end of his acknowledgements for his scholarship program for American high school and college students to study in Japan. Overall I was very disappointed."
1,apologist,this book was just an apologist for the cruelty the japanese inflicted on their enemies. the author dishonored these men for the book hints that they deserved what they got. the japanese were only imulating and modeling themselves after the united states. i kept reading this book to understand what happened to these men only to get a skewed history lesson on how horrible the united states was in establishing itself as a world power. i hated this book.
4,leave your biases at home when you read this,"This is a top ten book in my opinion and a must read. Bradley does draw conclusions but only after citing the conclusions and opinions of others that were there. I do not view this book as a guilt trip, but a historical look from both sides of the fence. While reading this book, I couldn't help but think of the middle east and our approach. War is hell and if your not prepared to fight like the devil, be prepared to be conquered by the devil.Bradley did a great job in citing historical events that brought us to the conclusion of WWII. If you are NOT a defender of american stupidity, you will enjoy this book. Im not a liberal and I dont feel guilt, but Im not stupid either, and I dont appreciate being lied to by the public school system and having been fed a buncha bulls*it on how the west was won starting somewhere in 1492."
4,A revealing story,A great book. I would have given it 5 stars but thought it was overwritten and too detailed at times. I'd previously thought Hirohito wasn't so bad -- just a captive of the military. Not so. The extent of George Bush's heroism was another revelation.
1,Music to make you wish you were deaf!!!,"I listen to a lot of new age music and I would have to say that this is the WORST CD that I have ever listened to. Not only did it put me to sleep within the first 5 min of listening to it, I woke up with a horrible headache! If I could get a refund I WOULD!"
3,kind of a dud,My cats were not real interested but they are older and prefer interactive toys. Kittens might be more interested in this.
2,This case is stanky,Just to concur with the other review. This case does indeed stink. The fancy plastic that they used to form the case has a very strong odor for some reason. Other than the stench it is an excellent case. I can't begin to understand why Palm released a product that smells bad.
3,Would get 5 stars if it weren't for the smell,"Functionally, the case is exactly what I was looking for.But the smell really is weird. After a few hours I couldn't take it any more. I removed the PDA from the case. The case is now soaking in some hot, soapy dishwater in the kitchen sink. I hope that will remove the smell, otherwise the case will have to go into the trash. Also, I had to change my clothes and wash them too. Unbelievable--all from a little case!If it weren't for the smell, I would have given this product 5 stars."
1,Avoid at all costs - disgusting smell,Nice idea. Horrible execution - I mean horrible smell. This case is going back to the place of purchase first chance I get. DO NOT BUY THIS THING.
5,The BEST toy out there!,"My daughter got these as a gift and it's the BEST toy she has - and she has LOTS! She LOVES them and from 12- 26 months, she's enjoyed them - and she's not done yet! They're a great learning tool and the kids love to stack them because they're great blocks too! I started noticing that when other kids would come over, even the 3 year olds - they went straight for these books! Now it's my signature baby shower present. I gave away 3 last year. Worth every dime!"
5,The definitive soundtrack of the '70s,"Let's start by saying that it's pretty widely accepted that ""FM"" the movie, was not nearly as great as ""FM"" the movie soundtrack. The movie was funky and quirky, yet it did ""begat"" ""WKRP in Cincinnati"" which WAS one of the great unsung sit-coms of the '70s. But I digress, back to the soundtrack... Simply put, ""FM"" is truly one of the best compilations of '70s music that's every been put together in one format. If aliens were listening across the radio waves of space to music of this era, they could get the best sampling by picking up on this CD.Buffett, Ronstadt (two GREAT live cuts), The Doobies, Steely Dan, Steve Miller, Joe Walsh, Billy Joel, The Eagles, and others are featured on this great CD. 20 terrific cuts with no duds among the group. If you're looking for THE DEFINITIVE '70s compilation, grab a copy of this CD while they're still in production and enjoy hours and hours of great music!"
2,Duplicate,Disc 2 has the exact same songs as disc 1. I like the songs but would have prefered the music to be as was on the cover.
2,WRONG DISCS,"Received original two disc set numbered 1 and 2, on playing them they were both disc 1, returned them and received replacement discs but once again two discs numbered 1 and 2 but also ince again they are both disc 1will try one last time....getting frustrated!"
5,Linda from Missouri,I was so happy to come across this Narrated Bible in Chronological order. I have always wanted to know when things happened in bible in order to help me better understand where things happend time. I love that there is commentary and that all the scripture is written all across the page it makes it easy to read. I love the NIV bible so it is a package deal. I actually think I can read the whole bible for the first time in my life all the way through and understand when and where it took place. The only thing that would have made this bible perfect would be to have tabs or thumb nail to find scripture faster as the table to find scripture is the the back of book and takes a little longer to find.I would recommend this book.
2,The cowbell is not included like you see in the picture.,"The cowbell is not included like you see in the picture. Maybe I should have read the desc. more but this was a quick buy, or so I thought till it showed up with no cowbell."
2,a view from over the hero's shoulder.,"Hillary is not going to get a Nobel Price for this book. It is written in a rather 'choppy' style. Hard to follow and sometimes plain boring. From time to time, many basic inportant information is left out leaving the reader completely lost. However, this book gives us a chance to take a glimpse at the human side of this great explorer. We finally see details about adventures never revealed before because authors deem them unimportant but this kind of details actually allow the readers to see the adventures from a different angle. We see Hillary as a human being and share with him his adventures and his goals. It is just extraordinary to see a man raise from a life as a simple beekeeper to become one of the most important figures of this century and not lose his human quality in the process. This book is a good alternative to a rootcanal."
3,An illusion shattered,"On the plus side, this is indeed a proper 'boys own' story and is very well written. Unfortunately, the reader becomes quickly aware of the arrogance of Hillary. Clearly he is a gifted climber who possesed endurance way beyond that of the average human. However, this is over-shadowed by the authors arrogance as he tells the reader how much better he was than those around him.In a way i wish i had not read the book as it has shattered a romantic illusion I had of what Hillary was really like. It also made me very sympathetic of those who had to endure him in the ice packs of Antartica and the isolation of the death zone of Everest."
4,My Feet Have Their Own Spa Now!,"The bubbling action in this footbath is like NO other! I have had several to compare it to. The only downside is the heat setting does very little to maintain the water temperature. Even when hot water is placed in the footbath, it is quite cool by the time my pedicure is done. Wish it helped to hold the heat of the water better. Other than that, it is super!"
2,like new......or not,The Book was said to be in almost new condition and it came looking more used than most books I have read several times. I was disappointed in the condition of the book.
4,Great book but read Once a Princess first,This is a sequel to Once a Princess. Although it would be a good book read alone it is a really good book read after.
4,An easy read.,"Lingered a bit too much on the nastiness between the two main characters -- got tiresome. Would rather have seen them melt a little toward each other, despite their convictions that they would not marry, even though they were both bound by honor by their fathers' betrothal contract. Was disappointed in the scene where Yasili sees Alexandra for the first time dressed as a lady. He should have been more pleasantly stunned. Would have like to see a much longer scene of the wedding and of their admissions that they indeed loved each other. I closed the book not remembering if they every said that to each other. But I liked the story and found the twist to the plot interesting. Seemed to be rushed to finish the ending, which was the most important part of the story and deserved many more pages than it got. Editor's push for time?"
5,Best Liners on the Market,"These are the best cat box liners in the world! I've tried countless other brands, but none work like these. They are thick enough to withstand kitty scratches, big enough to fit even my jumbo sized cat box, and the drawstring is so helpful. If you have a large litter box, these are a must have!"
1,Didn't work for us,"When installed, this did not deliver enough gas to get the temperature where it needs to be for most cooking. We took it off and went back to the tank!"
2,Blackberry Case,This case was less than I expected. It fixed loosely on my 9100 unit and the holes did not match.
2,Wrong color; wrong back cutouts for Verizon Pearl,"The title says it all. Received dark navy blue, nearly black, instead of the blue pictured... camera not usable on Verizon Pearl without cutting a hole, which looks sloppy. But, it was cheap so not worth the expense or hassle of returning. [...]"
3,Not bad,"Being an aficionado of Hip-hop I had high expectations for this album. Having said that, it's a good album. Not much in the form of catchy loops or beats though."
5,Good quality,I purchased this for my son almost a year ago. My son likes Pokemon and watches this fairly often. He doesn't tire of watching the movie over again.
3,We love Moo Moo,"This is a great book but it was ripped in no time. Since the kids have to pull the tabs, the tabs were ripped pretty quickly. They still love to read this book even though so many parts of the book have been ripped off."
3,books good box bad,"I was really looking forward to getting this box of books for my son. He opened it on Christmas and couldn't wait to read them, the very first time he opened the lid on the box the box fell apart on the side. I put a strip of clear packing tape on the seam to hold it together and it's fine now but I shouldn't have to do that for a brand new item. Not as quality as the nickelodeon box of books. The books themselves are great and we haven't had any problems with them."
4,M:I-2... and hopefully not the end,"I saw the INSPIRED BY album. I thought, Geez, what a piece of S**T. Now, we have the score CD for Mission: Impossible 2. I am very pleased with the CD. The scores by Hans Zimmer are as good as Danny Elfman's score... if not better. The new M:I theme with the rock/grunge sound to it is really good. Don't be fooled by the INSPIRED BY stuff.... and get M:I-2 (The Score)."
4,For Parents this is Great,"This is a wonderful book for parents of children with Aspergers syndrome. It is a resource book and tactical manual on dealing with healthcare providers and, more importantly, with schools and school districts. It is not a book on treatment, or diagnosis except and general discussions. This is also not a book to help adults with Aspergers. Good sections on dealing with children and adolescents with the problem. Many coping strategies for parents."
5,Practical and Insight-filled,"Filled with practical and useful information on everything from initial diagnosis, interventions, treatments, medications, school issues, family issues and more. All presented with sound supporting information from current research. A must for any parent whose child has been diagnosed with Asperger's/High functioning autism. The authors'personal humorous moments and insights are a very nice touch and make the reader aware of the struggles faced by so many who are touched in one way or another by Asperger's. A very good resource as well for school professional libraries for the nice overview of the disorder, its complexity, and challenges in meeting the needs of those with Asperger's/HFA."
1,Looking for the original Chuck Wagon and the Wheels?,"If you want the CDs from the original band and not these posers then go to CDBaby.com, and search for Chuck Maultsby, or you can get MP3s from Amazon if you search for Chuck Maultsby and his old band."
4,Possibly contains BPA?,"The product is not labeled as to whether it contains BPA, which is a concern, since I use it for hot liquids. Other than that, it works well and the spout plug is useful."
5,So far so good,Replaced an original battery that had lived its useful life. A few months later this one is still going strong.
2,No suspense...,"I love to read about true crime, but there is so much information given on the back cover that there is no ""surprise"" once you read about the trials. I think that the stories inside the book would have been more interesting to read had the cover not given so much information."
4,"Could be better, but not a bad starting point","I think the other reviews are accurate for the most part. For example, as one other reviewer mentions, this book uses a lot of phonetic terms like ""affricative"" and ""labio"" that really frustrated me at first. But using a dictionary, I created a little glossary of all the terms used and as I got to know the terms better, I found the descriptions more helpful than any other source for correct pronunciation. (These descriptions alone are, I think, worth the cost of the book.)Another reviewer mentions that this book doesn't compare any of these sounds to English equivalents. I think this is done to help the student begin the process of ""thinking in Chinese"" which, while frustrating at first, probably pays off down the road.I've used two other books and several Web sites to help me learn Chinese. I don't know if I'd recommend this book by itself, but together with other sources, I think it's invaluable."
5,"If you have trouble believing God Love Us, buy this!","Not many things, give me a sense of God's Greatness and love. I saw this at a friends and had to have a copy for myself.I need a ""refresher"" now and then."
3,Excellent Documentary,"This DVD brings out some of the scientific facts that brings evidence that our planet is created and uniquely designed to sustain life. All human beings are created to learn, to enjoy life, and to give praise to their Creator. Life has a purpose! I wish the DVD concludes this way. Excellent documentary!"
