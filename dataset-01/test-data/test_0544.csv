5,Great reference book!,"I used this book in high school to help prepare for a Science Olympiad, and also to help study for my earth science class. It is comprehensive, clear, and just one of the best references I've ever used. I would recommend this to anyone interested in geology or learning to identify rocks and minerals, or who needs to learn for a class. I will be purchasing several more National Audubon Society Field Guides because of my experience with this one."
3,not the best,"We have been very happy with this product line over all. Our grandson (20 mos.) loves the plane and fire engine. The boat, however, doesn't float in the bath very well - tends to flip more easily than it floats. The squirting feature is ok but not enough to make it a good bath toy."
3,Fireboat,"Our Grandtwins are constantly playing fireman/policeman. They needed some new bathtub toys and this seemed like just the thing. They are enjoying them. I am a little disappointed in them in that they do not float too well and they are difficult to get the water to pump out of them. The boat naturally has to be in the water but for a small child you have to hold it in one hand and pump with the other. If you don't hold it, it will just sink as you push down on the pump."
3,An average but dark book!,A History Of Violence was a dark and gritty tale of a man's quest to escape from his painful and obviously violent past. Wagner's plot is pretty basic but it does reach into some very dark places. The art by Locke is sketchy which fits this well but at times it was very hard to distinguish between characters or see exactly what was be depicted. Overall there isn't anything very new here but its decent.
3,The inspiration for Austin Powers?,"Not much could be more sheer 60's British Go-Go than this. Stick a Mike Myer's Austin Powers photo in the middle of this cover, in place of Mark Wirtz, and you've got it. This isn't up to the standards of Mark's better works using popular vocalists. In style, think of James Bond soundtrack orchestras covering hits of the day and other light fare. In the 60's, it would have been categorized under ""Easy Listening"" but today it is legitimately cool ""Lounge""! For more fully deveoped efforts in which Mark guided the ship, see ""Philwit and Pegasus"" or the ""Teenage Opera"" soundtrack where solid UK session players and good vocalists had more prominent roles."
1,Where is it?,I have not yet recieved my order. It's been delayed a few times. I'm disappointed it's taking so long. It should be available if you're asking for a review.
2,needs a better handle,"this could have been a great contender for ""spatula of the year"" but it fell short on the handle. the handle went down for the count in the first round. i used this on a large griddle and as i was frying onions for cheese steaks the wobble started and i could feel the handle loosening from the blade. one or two more chops into the onions and she was out for the count on the mat.i would have sent it back but @ $7 it wasn't worth it"
4,Really useful book,"My husband and I have followed four recipes from this book with good results. By keeping a journal like the authors suggest, we are learning what works and what doesn't. This book really helps you learn the whole process, and make adjustments based off of your personal tastes.Some of the food recipes sound just terrible, we haven't tried those."
5,America's Lady of Letters...,"...the Great Erica Jong.I remember people comparing her to Phillip Roth when Fear of Flying and this came out and since I was into popular fiction a lil more back then than I am now, I vowed to read one of her books. Little did I know back then that she would become one of my favorite all time writers. And I agree that this would be the better offering of the first two novels, because Isadora Wing, to me, seems more real in this one. And it tells of going thru a emotionally sterile period in her life and how she reached fulfillment. Wing is Jong and if you want to get an idea of how and what a woman thinks without being intrusive and obtusive this is one good way to do it...(however, don't rely on this alone). There is outrageous erotica, verbal play and plenty of first person quips all thru it and you will be thoroughly entertained. Don't forget to get a load of Jong's poetry. Read also Jong's great piece on Henry Miller, ""The Devil at Large"". Excellent writing!"
4,"Extremely useful, and you don't have to actually be a medical writer","It gets off to a good start, albeit a somewhat wordy one, about the value of clear thinking and clear writing. This is followed by lists of misspelled words, misused words, unnecessary words, imprecise words... Get the idea? Since I don't suffer from any of these symptoms, an overlong list of treatments had the unintended effect of curing my insomnia.I apologize to the authors, whose effort is to be commended, but I don't recommend reading this cover-to-cover any more than I would recommend reading an encyclopedia or dictionary that way. Dip in as needed to save yourself hours of Googling, perhaps. I will, however, use what they had to say about Watson and Crick, who wrote about their Nobel-winning research on the nature of DNA with stunning simplicity and clarity."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book was a waste of money. It is written for the paper test, which is not given anymore. There are a few modifications for the CAT, but it is obvious the authors did not put much time into modifying the book for the CAT. The computer program contains many careless errors. In fact, the analytical section had omitted words and parts of clues. In places, the questions were unanswerable because of these omissions. The quantitative section had many errors, and even gave incorrect answers for some of the graph questions. This book may cause you to do worse on the GRE's. I bought this book along with Peterson's cracking the GRE and the ETS ""Big Book"". The Peterson's book contains some useful hints on the analytical section, but I strongly recommend the ETS Big Book and the ETS PowerPrep software."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"This was our Book Club selection for Dec. 2006 and we all really needed something more than what this book offered. It was a painful read after starting off relatively strong. It really had so much potential, what a let down. And the ""secret"" that was finally revealed? Ridiculous! I could have come up with something better than that.Don't waste your effort slogging through the mess that this book is."
3,Mixed feelings,"The BramblesThe book starts out with a mother/father whom now have grown children and are looking to rent a place. Then we skip around to the three grown children and their lives. The mother passed away too soon in a plane crash and gramps has cancer. He is going to live with Margaret. From there we skip back and forth between the three siblings as they try to come to terms with losing their mother and now their father.I enjoyed this book but some of it just didn't fit. Like Tammy, what point did she really have? If someone was sitting by my house and going threw my garbage I wouldn't just tell her to go away I would make sure she was escorted. The ending seems to be as if the author just didn't know how to finish it.This doesn't deter me from wanting to read other books by this author however. She wrote dead-on about being a mother, and for that character alone I made it through the book."
1,Not worth your time,"I really did not enjoy this book. After finishing it, I don't even really know what the point was. I don't fully understand the twist at the end or why it was even necessary. It could have been left out of the book completely and I would have made no difference. I don't know why the character of ""Tammy"" was even in the book. All in all, this book was a big disappointment for me."
4,From boys to men!,"If you are a VB guy, considering stepping into the .NET realm, then you need to get to grips with proper OO techniques and modelling.I think this is a good book, probably more relevant to C++/Java guys but not too heavy going."
4,Excellent application of the scientific method,Nova did a superb job of featuring the scientists who are unearthing ancient biblical sites and placing artifacts on a timeline in relation to biblical stories. It reveals how carbon dating works within archeology and how new archeological sites are shedding new light on the old testament. It also discusses the theory of five principal teams who wrote the old testament. I found it refreshing and definitely worth adding to my DVD library.
5,Outstanding!,Mr. Lamy's book has alleviated many of the fears I had regarding the purchase of a new/used boat. His thoughts on how to deal with sales people is priceless. This book should be read by any person interested in buying or selling a small power boat.I would love to see him write a book on general maintenance.
2,"better than the first, but still pretty mundane","The standard, and by now pretty stale, Turtledove formula - cast of thousands, multiple points of view. Dialogue was pretty stilted and repetitive, and the characters aren't very interesting. I am convinced he got all his Japanese phrases from reading James Clavell's ""Shogun"" - Turtledove's Japanese characters say the exact same things as Clavell's. (Did real Japanese people even talk like that in 1941?)On the whole, I was glad I got this from the library rather than buying it. It occupied a couple of hours on a dreary winter day, but it has no lasting value. I agree with the other reviewers who say there's not much room for a sequel to this book, but knowing Turtledove, that doesn't mean there won't be one."
1,Over Long & Repititious,"Somebody get this guy an editor! By the time I got to the end of this book if I read ""You wouldn't be wrong ..."" or about someone lighting up a cigarette one more time, I was ready to throw the damn book out. Turtledove used to be great but if this book is any indication you wouldn't be wrong if you lit this book on fire with the match you used to light your cigarette and never picked up another Turtledove book."
2,Not bad but there are better out there,"I found this book somewhat helpful when planning a trip to San Francisco. It has a lot of information about sightseeing, eating out and accomodations. However, it is sorely lacking in visual stimulation including pictures of the destination and maps. I foresaw the lack of a decent map being a huge problem once in SF and decided to get a Lonely Planet guide to supplement this one.Overall, I found the Lonely Planet SF guide much easier to use and definitely more entertaining to look at. If you're going to SF and need to purchase a good guide book, I'd go with that one. This one will suffice if it is all you can find but if other options are available, think twice before purchasing."
3,one worked perfect but the other one is causing drops,"Got a new flatscreen TV last year, hooked up to cable box last year with this HDMI cable and it has never skipped a beat. Got a blue ray DVD player for XMAS, after a few minutes with a variety of content, audio/video drop out, get the no signal on the TV. Reseating cable connection at TV fixes the problem. Swapped cables for cable box and cable box exhibits the same problem with the bad cable."
4,Fans of Opus 110 will be disappointed,"Sonata No. 31 appears to be missing from this set, and you can certainly get these performances in better sound. On the other hand, it's practically free, so it's hard to work up much indignation."
1,Terrible sound. Huge disservice to a great artist. Don't get suckered by the price.,"I have two NAXOS CDs of this Schnabel collection. But Naxos does not sell the entire set at a reasonable price. So when I saw this set at what is an incredible price I promptly ordered it. Big mistake! The sound quality, even for my untrained ears, is terrible. I was so very disappointed because the Naxos CDs I have are superb. I would have been better off coughing up the bread and building the whole Schnabel Naxos set by purchasing individual CDs. Until then I'll keep listening to my Goode and Kempf sets."
1,Not What It Used To Be!,"I agree with comment from customer who stated this product has changed! And not for the better! I have been using Vitapoint since I was a little girl, when my mother used it on my long hair. Now over 45 yrs. later I'm very disappointed that it has changed from the soft, smooth cream it always was, to a thicker, stickier one."
3,Product Satisfaction,"The Balaclava was warm and comfortable to wear, the only problem was they bleed after the first wash. Kind of like those cheap cotton T-shirt that after a few washs, little round clothing fiber started to clinch to the fabric. Also, the fabric was a lot thicker than in the picture."
2,meh,Price was right but the fabric is a little rough feeling and I really dislike the seam running down the inside against the face! I think seamless microfiber is the way to go for a face mask/balaclava.
3,leaves a crazy mark on your face,"got this to wear when riding in cold weather, at the end of my ride I took off my full face helmet and had a crazy looking zigzag mark down my face. also a little sore to the touch, just bad placement of that seam."
3,"good,,,,","Very itchy when I first put this on. And it bunch up on the top too. Buuuuuut,,,,, after washing it sever times, It does fit a little better. Still itches some ( just not so bad). Thought of getting rid of it, but instead will use this one under my helmet or while doing outside work on cold days."
4,Warm!,"Definitely very warm... it isn't as soft as I was hoping for, to be honest... a little scratchier than I was aiming for. It is definitely warm and works great for the application I got it for... wearing it under my snowboarding helmet. I guess I was hoping for a softer material underneath, but it definitely keeps my head warm... My husband also got one and he said it reminds him of the material that he wore int he fire service under his firefighter helmet. It is quality material, just not very soft."
2,Outdated and amateurish,"Needs updating concerning newer materials, tools and techniques. It is a bit too loving hands at home. If updated this could make a serious textbook for design students."
4,Sprouts!,"The narration is strong, the characters laugh-out-loud funny, dialogue crisp, and the images well-rendered. But what really shines in this novel is the kind of mystic golden-age quality that defines the Kansas City of the narrator's youth. At times it can border on being a little too well-remembered, a golden autumnal haze engulfing everyone and everything, but just when it gets closest to this, it is interrupted by the cruel reality of the adult world. In the end, this tendency to sentimentalize youth and school-days works because it exists to be the contrast against which the narrator discovers the ""real"" world of backroom deals, dishonesty and fallen heroes.And if that isn't enough, just look at all the bickering it caused. Doesn't that make you want to read it?"
4,We are wired for worship.,"Short. Sweet and to the point. It drives home that we are not the central focus in the world. That there is one that is and we need to recognize him. It reminds us how easy it is to become distracted in everyday lives and that we need to see our fickleness and recognize our weaknesses and understand that there is only 1 that deserves worship and it is not the TV, the car, the job, the husband or wife, the boyfriend/girlfriend, my boss it is GOD, the creator and perfector and author of everything."
4,Takes a little getting used to,"One might expect these to taste like potato chips. One would be wrong. I thought these would be like the old Munchos (showing my age?), but these are more potato-y and less oily and fried tasting. It took 4 or 5 before I decided these were pretty good. Not good for humid weather, though."
4,It does as advertised.,"I have had the Xantrex 852-0200 for a few months and have used several times and it has worked well. I have not used it charge a battery and I can't speak to the manufacturing problems mentioned by others but I have used it to power a laptop, an IPOD stereo system as well as a desk lamp and after about two hours of combined usage, it still indicated a charge of a a little more then half. I also used it on a tire but I only needed to top it up, I got the impression that this may not be an efficient way to fill up more then one tire at a time but it served it's purpose.Overall I like this and as long as you don't expect it to run your house, it should prove handy for when you need a few hours of power for low energy products."
2,Fatal Flaw,"Buyers should be aware of the following problem. The recharging system has what tech support described as a ""low-charge cutoff"", which is designed to keep the battery from falling below a minimum level of charge. The problem occurs when the unit falls below the minimum charge which can happen if you leave it sitting around for a while. When the unit is plugged into an outlet to charge the battery, the ""low power cutoff"" prevents the battery from being charged, so you find yourself in a catch-22. The battery cannot be charged because the ""cutoff"" mechanism prevents the battery from being used OR EVEN CHARGED! (A red light accompanied by a clicking sound is heard when this occurs) Tech support's recommendation is to turn the unit upside-down for 24hrs (I kid you not) and try again. If this dosen't work, their recommendation is to throw it away and buy a new one. My recommendation is to avoid buying the charger at all until they reengineer it to not self-destruct. Caveat Emptor."
2,"Depends on what your definition of ""atlas"" is, I guess.","This book provides a nice summary of some of the major campaigns on the Eastern Front in World War II. For instance, it has a chapter on the siege of Sevastopol which provides more information than you'll find in most general histories. However, it is not what I've come to expect in a book that calls itself an atlas on a military history topic. The maps are rather few and far between. For example, the chapter on The Winter Attack on Moscow is about 29 pages long. In those 29 pages there are a total of four maps, and those maps aren't anything special. Some chapters, like the one one the Siege of Leningrad have more maps, but it still is a disappointment. I expected a lot more, cartographically speaking, from a 180-page ""atlas""."
3,"1 good, 1 poor","The 2 cases were two different types, with one pretty good and one worthless (cheap construction, to thin, didn't fit right). This review refers to the good one:Pro: Good protection for phone. Easy off and on if you put the flip part on first and stretch the other part over the base. I love silicon covers for the protection and grip. The good case is very good.Con: Chargers don't connect well through the case because of the raised silicon area around the connector hole. I found if I used an exacto knife to bevel the plastic edges on the charger connector (not the case), it took care of the problem, but if you don't do that, you'll end up taking the bottom of the phone out of the case to charge, leading to extra wear/tearing. It isn't designed to be removed every charge!"
5,A good 'go to' book from time to time,"Even though I'm 49, I still got some good info from this book. I think I've built a good wardrobe over the years, full of 'staple' items. After ordering this book, I realized that I was lacking some pieces that I really never even considered, to give my clothes some new spark. I went out and invested in a nice logo bag (authentic Louis Vuitton bag). There are a few other interesting items I have added to my closet to get more mileage from my existing wardrobe without having to spend a lot of extra money, thanks to the book. Buy the book to keep as reference."
3,A lot of common sense...,"I wouldn't consider myself a fashion idiot, but I definitely have questions about matching funky colors (when it doesn't include black) and other questions. Unfortunately, this book is more of a review of the types of clothes you can buy. It is broken down into shirts, pants, jeans, shoes, etc. and it details the various styles out there and which ones make you look nice and how to avoid looking frumpy.Unfortunately, I found very little insight or enlightenment with this book and wouldn't really recommend it...it is well put together and is attractive in its setup, but it isn't very helpful for those who are looking to really enhance their wardrobe. It was a lot of common sense information that if I know, a lot of other women out there must already know too."
2,"Lots of pictures, not substance","Lots of pictures, but not much substance. You can keep a bunch of tricks, but I would say just 5-10% of the content is useful."
4,Great Book--but need a little more help on where to go.....,"I've been a loyal subscriber to Lucky magazine since it came out and I love it! Naturally, when I saw this book, I ordered it right away. The book is well done and gives tons of great fashion ideas that I will try. I love how the book is illustrated and also, how they walk you through the wardrobe essentials. But, I have to say that I am a wee bit dissapointed that there isn't more information on where the clothing and accessories featured in the book can be purchased--I saw many items that I want but don't know where to go to get them--a little frustrating for a shop-a-holic."
4,"Great drawings, well organized","I love this book! now I realize how little I knew about myself and about how I dress until I got this book, I gave it a 4 star only because it does not say much about colors and color coordinating your clothing or about basic summer, spring, winter clothing colors. Hopefully the authors will include that in the next issue. Other than that, this book is great for any type and size of people who want to learn how to choose clothing items that make them look their best. I keep this book handy as my reference book while I work on improving my wardrove, I specially like the huge number of drawings and picuter, to me a picture is worth a thousand words and this book proves it."
2,Just a re-hash of the magazine,If you read Lucky magazine reguarly then you've already seen everything in this book- there's nothing new.
2,Very dry and disjointed but interesting,"About the only reason I finished this book was to learn more of the fascinating life Hickok led. I had given up on finishing it up twice. It was really hard to follow as Jospeh G Rosa would jump around in time to much. You'd would lose of when things happened and what order they happened in. The sense of time and place was missing. It was more organized in terms of themes rather then a straight forward chronological account of Wild Bill's life. Nothing wrong with this if your already familiar with Wild Bill's life, but very confusing to somebody that doesn't know anything about it."
4,"Great shock for the buck, better then OEM cheaper too",Much better then the ford stock shocks. At 51k miles I had a front shock go out. Just finished installing the Monroe Reflex I did both front and back part numbers 911196 and 911195. Install was easy even had the woman help. Ride was MUCH MUCH better. I wanted to get rebuildable shocks but would have been around 130 a shock. This is a much better option.My truck is 2004 F350 6.0 Diesel 6-speed Single Rear Wheel Long Bed
1,Too tight a fit,"I do not like having to wrestle with sliding cd/dvd's in and out of these sleeves. The dimensions are about 4-7/8""x4-7/8"", about an 1/8"" smaller than other sleeves I have purchased. I will not buy Memorex again."
3,Functional But Not For Professional Use,"These Memorex CD\DVD Sleeves work as expected to hold CD\DVD media but as others have noted, the rubber band used to package the sleeves significantly wrinkled the clear plastic window that shows the image printed on the disc. Ordinarily this would not be a problem for most uses, but we professionally produce instructional and promotional videos that we bulk distribute in similar sleeves. Unfortunately we ran out at the end of a production run so needed a few extra to finish the job so I ended up buying two packs of these locally and went through them to find fifty that were not too badly distorted to use for our customer, the rest we will use for our own discs in our shop.Otherwise these are decent enough quality for daily use.CFH"
3,The rubber band is ridiculous,"As has been stated in other reviews, despite being in a box that provides sufficient protection, a rubber band is wound tightly round the sleeves. Tight enough to where it has left a crease in all of the sleeves, and bent them. This doesn't affect functionality - your CDs/DVDs will still be protected, but it is annoying how bad the sleeves look right out of the box."
5,Excellent reference book,"I'm applying for the CAPM exam, and this book is really great. It covers all the topics, and in a logical order. All the knowledge areas and processes are covered, but from a process point of view, which is the natural way. Because in the real world, at work, things happen in a given order: there is a beggining, a process (something has to be done), and a result of that process.This book covers those real world examples and needs, by organizing the material in process groups: initiating, planning, executing, controlling and closing.These key processes then are explained in depth, with their respective tools and techniques, methods, examples, and reference to the knowledge areas to whom they belong.Great book for begginers, for those about to be tested, and excelent refreshment and reference for any PMP."
2,Do not read this book,"I bought this because it seemed to have 5 star ratings. After 2 weeks, I realize that this book takes a process group approach, and is very confusing to relate to PMBOK. Also many concepts that are integral to passing PMP, such as in procurement, are not covered in this book. You can read this book if you want general understanding of project management concepts but this will definitely not help from exam point of view. Also, if you read this book with some other good book like Rita, you will be even more confused. $50 is not worth. Skip it and you wont regret it."
4,The BEST train music for kids,"This is the second of James Coffey's cds we have bought. Honestly, our all time favorite is his other train cd- even my husband and I love to listen to the catchy tunes. The songs on this cd are good too, just not as good as the other. My 3 year old still prefers the other cd too."
1,I received a poor quality black and white checkered lanyard as well.,"The product does not even come close to matching the picture. Buy this at your own risk. Instead of a ""pinch off"" strap it is a ""screw off"" strap. The quality resembles that of playground necklaces from middle school. Very disappointed, not worth six dollars if this is what they're selling now.Please update the picture or stop sending the wrong one Amazon!"
4,Little Black Girl Lost,"This book was so good, but the ending was a total let down. Hopefully there will be a follow up."
5,Interesting,"This book was very interesting, I finished it in two days! I just have one question, what happened to Earl? After the riot his business had to pay out for all the insurance claims and eventhough his wife paid Johnnie to stay away from her husband; could Earl live without seeing Johnnie? I can't wait to read the sequel!"
3,Simple and Absorbing but Disappointing in the End,"Written in a simple yet compelling style, Keith Lee Johnson's telling of young Johnnie Wise's introduction to prostitution sucked me in right from the beginning. This story isn't a coming-of-age tale by any means. From the moment, Johnnie's mother sold her to the white insurance man, this 15 year old grew up quickly. Johnnie's candid and calculating view of her new occupation had me shaking my head at Johnnie's every scheme and ploy. This book was filled with just enough sex to keep you blushing. Little Girl Lost lost me with it's horrible ending. I felt as if I had been left hanging, as if Mr. Johnson threw some words down on the last ten pages because he got tired of writing. My sister finished it first and she agreed that although it was an interesting book, the ending left a lot to be desired."
1,It doesn't get much worst than this,"I can honestly say this is the worst book I have ever read by R.L.Stine. I was actually angry when I finished the book. The story is ridiculous, senseless, and just awful. And the ending is the biggest groaner ending in history. It really does not make much sense at all, and it certainly isn't scary. It turns into this frustrating Twilight Zone episode - a terrible episode that makes you change the channel and shake your head in disgust. Please, do not read this book."
2,Disappointed,"I strongly disagree with revues likening this book to Gates of Fire, or any previous work.Gates of Fire, was an emotional experience, an all time favorite. Afghan Campaign, is bland, predictable, and for me completely lacking any emotion. I felt nothing,....maybe numb.Each of Pressfields books has had it's own flavor. Some more to my liking than others. This had *no* flavor. I have a hard time giving 2 stars, but I have so much enjoyed his other works."
3,Serious disappointment,"What this book is lacking most is a plot. Most of the book is just the main character walking around from place to place. What is more disturbing, however, is how out-of-place the character's moralizing seems to me.Of course, I wasn't in Macedonia in the 4th Century B.C.E. but all the soul-searching about the horrors of war seem awfully Western-liberal-Christian-21st Century to me. Pressfield imports a completely foreign value-system and superimposes it on his story, undermining any authenticity for the book.The third major flaw is the predictable and contrived way he set's up his tragic ending. I won't spoil it but, when you're done I'll bet you'll find it as unsatisfying as I did.Sure the book has good points (which others here have lauded far beyond their justification) but, over all, this is a disappointment--especially when I know he can put out good stuff (""Gates of Fire,"" ""Virtues of War,"" ""The Last Amazon."")"
1,Doesn't Work,"I should have believed those other reviews that says this Serial Adapter doesn't work on XP, because it doesn't. The driver included on the CD does absolutly nothing, and the adapter simply will not work. Do not buy it if you are running XP."
1,Beware -- does not work with MAC OS X!!!,"It gets one star because amazon won't let you give something zero stars.Basically, this is one of the first peripherals I've tried that does not work with a OS X Jaguar. (It works with Mac OS 8.x and 9.x, but not with Jaguar.) After searching the Iogear support site, they have a one sentence tech note ""regretting any inconvenience"" that they don't support it."
3,=),This cd was a hard find when I saw it on Amazon I knew that I needed to pick it up for my mom who has been looking for it for ages.She loves it.
4,Good Key Storage,this is a nice metal box that locks and has plenty of room for all sorts of keys you use around the house. Comes with tags and rings and you can't beat the price. Worth the money and I recomend it.
4,Key Lock Up Board,"Good box to lock up keys or store them. Has holes inside so you can easily mount it anywhere with a few screws.I think it was listed at a fair price and it does exactly what I need it to do, Have keys hanging in one organized box that can be locked."
4,Solid cases,Used these jewel cases to ship games across the country. The cases stood up to the rigours of the postal service and arrived safely. They are light and low profile and provide ample protection -- the price is right too.
2,I hate these!,"Made with ultra-cheap plastic. The hinges break really easily making the cases useless. I would recommend spending more money on a higher quality product.The ones that don't break seem to do the job okay, thus 2 stars."
1,Too hard to open,"It is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them. On the flip side once they have been opened once, they don't reclose very well."
1,Joe Barone Big Buyer,cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money.
5,Good Deal,These jewel cases do what they are suppose to do and came at a good price. I will be ordering more before too long and I will go with the Memorex brand again.
4,like,I needed the cases and have no problem with these. The price seems great for so many. They are not heavy but do the job. I do like these for protection of the disc.Good price good item !
4,Built to last,"I have had this keyboard for going on 6+ years now. this keyboard has had numerous hitting, spills, crumbs thrown at it and it has never broke.keys can be a little sticky after this long, but mine is too dirty to clean. the keys are still firm, none of the letters or numbers have worn out on them. although they are plastic keys, they can slip sometimes. they also after long periods of time have a build-up of skin on they keys that your hands rest on. for long peroids of typing it preforms average, no incredible features.the only thing that has broken on this keyboard is the back stand. that was after i hit the side of it and it snapped off. it was never to be seen again.none of the keys seem out of place, they are all really easy to reach, they all feel right, i had a problem where the shift key would be too far up, therefor hard to reach with my pinky.i recommend this keyboard because of price and durability.i gave it a 4 because it is average, just a tank on top of it"
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I bought this keyboard because I needed a very basic keyboard with a PS/2 connection, and this seemed like the best choice.It does indeed have a PS/2 connection, and it is, upon close inspection, a keyboard.I do wish it were more compact, as it takes up a fair amount of space for such a basic keyboard."
2,Not USB.,"Seriously, why the heck does this keyboard come up when you search for usb keyboard? Thank god it was so cheap. (Then again, it seems sturdy enough to survive nuclear war.)"
3,good basic keyboard,"I got this keyboard because of the Logitech name and the PS/2 connection (which is becoming rare for keyboards), to use with a set of my computers connected to a KVM switch.It does the job well, especially for the price. Standard layout (another rare thing), pretty quiet (the only noisy key is the spacebar), seems built OK, decent looking.The drawbacks: it is quite thick/tall (and, because of this, uncomfortable), its looks could use some improvement.If you can use USB and can put up with the not-so-standard layout, a much better choice is the Logitech Classic Keyboard 200 (which I usually use) -- smaller, slimmer, slicker, and more quiet."
5,Works as advertised!,"I did a lot of research before settling on this item and I'm pleased to say that it works very well. Good volume and fidelity, doesn't seem all that sensitive to in-car placement.Setup was very easy."
4,Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger for IPOD,"This is the best FM transmitter for iPod that I have tried...and I have tried a few. It sounds almost like listening to a CD. I used it on a trip from Nashville, TN to Lubbock, TX and was very happy with it.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that to tune it to 87.9 you have to use the ""easter egg"" and hold down the two right buttons to tune it. Once on 87.9 I cannot seem to get that station to set on the receiver; it always defaults to 107.9. Also, I have to put my iPod up in the visor to keep the static levels down. It may just be my Toyota Matrix but I seem to have more static if I set my iPod in the console, but up in the visor it is perfect.Other than those to little things, I love my new receiver and would recommend it to anyone."
2,Just didnt work for me - wish it had,"Same as all the other transmitters I have tried. I think I live in your average city (Cincinnati, OH). But I tested every channel setting in several geographic locations and never did find one that worked satisfactorily. The few stations that came close had too much hiss and/or static to make it useful. Glad others had success, not me."
4,Happy with it,"I've had this transmitter for a few months now and am happy with my purchase. I have good sound quality and little interference most of the time. If it's very cold out, it seems to take a minute or two after plugging in to warm up and overpower the radio signal, however.And as others have mentioned, you cannot broadcast easily on 87.9, which is unfortunately the best station in my area. Starting at 107.9, you must hold down the right two program buttons while pressing the up arrow to tune the transmitter to 87.9. The annoying part is that you must do this each time you connect the device, as you can't store 87.9 as a saved station. Since I disconnect the device almost every time I leave the car, this is very inconvenient. If it weren't for this, I'd wholeheartedly give it 5 stars."
2,doesn't work in a prius,"this thing works ok in my son's corolla, but doesn't work well at all in my Prius, there's some kind of interference in there and most of what you get is static. Plus it's almost impossible to see the readout."
1,Not Pleased,"I bought this transmitter for my iPod 60 video and it worked fine for the first 3 months although I hardly used it. I like to listen to satellite radio. It just sat in my car most of the time. I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not. Maybe the sunlight, I don't know, but it just stopped working. I noticed the light wouldn't come on. I thought something was wrong with my cigarette lighter at first but after plugging in other things that worked, I knew that wasn't the case. Some times when I plug it in I see it light up and then it works but soon after, it stops again. Sometimes I hit it and it starts working again. I don't know what the problem is, but everything else works fine in my cigarette lighter so I'm pretty sure it is the Kensington transmitter. Having to beat it in order to use it to me is too much of a hassel. Spend your hard earned money on something else."
4,Works nicely,"I have used this in the Chicago and Los Angeles area, and it works very nicely. The key is the ability to select all frequencies on the FM dial, more helpful than the preprogrammed ones."
2,Static..Static..Static,"I bought this product based on the great reviews I read. Unfortunatley, I have not had as much luck as everyone else. This is the second FM transmitter I've purchased for my iPod (the first actually sounded great, but did not fit properly in my car)and was really hoping for much better sound quality. There's a lot of static and a high pitch squell, not all the time, but most of the time."
4,Very pleased,Very pleased with the product but do not think that the cost of shipping was reprentative of lowest cost. I seems that it was a partial subsidy for somebody needing a shipment further and faster than I was interested in.
4,"Good, Not Great","I've tried a number of these FM Transmitters. None is perfect, but this one is better than most.Reception is good...design is ok...and it's easy to use. For the money, I think it's a great value."
2,A way to make digital music sound worse than worn vinyl,Sound not really acceptable. I had to return the unit. I did try the steps suggested by another reviewer but they didn't help. I am going to try cassette adapter and see how that works.
2,Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger for iPod,"This transmitter didn't work well with my car at all. My antenna is in the back, so that may have been part of the problem. First of all there was some static, but especially on the letter s. This gets really annoying with a song with alot of s sounds. Also, alot of the midrange background music that I knew was in some songs, and expected to hear never came through my speakers. This transmitter was good at getting the vocals and bass, but not much else. I returned mine and decided to just use the cd player in my car. I dont have a tape deck so this was my only option for ipodding in my car."
5,Wish they still made these.,Best FM transmitter I have had. To bad the FCC has required the newer versions to be weaker in signal strength.
5,Great Unit,"After reading all the reviews I decided to buy this transmitter. I previously had a cassette adapter, but bought a new car that did not have a cassette. The sound is so much better with this transmitter. No problems with interference, although I must say I live in a very rual state (Idaho) and have driven from one end of the state to the other with no problems. I have never changed the station after I set it, and have had great reception. This works great, don't pass this one up!"
4,"Excellent, if you find a totally empty station","The sound quality of this transmitter is excellent, and in almost every regard it is perfect, save one: it really does require a completely 'empty' frequency, or you will get interference.Out on the open highway, it's great, but in urban areas, I found that even on what I would consider totally empty frequencies with just low static, the transmitter was unable to completely overpower the static, so sound quality was diminished.I have a late-model car with a windshield-embedded antenna, which may or may not have something to do with the reception issues.All-in-all, however, this device works as promised, if not better, and the fact that it charges the iPod, too, is great!"
3,Fine except for the plug,"The transmitter works easily in my car - I have found several stations that work well with it. However the connector that plugs into my iPod is bad. Once I plug it in, I have to jiggle it in order for the sound to come out of all speakers. This means that each time I want to adjust things on the iPod I run the risk of getting the plug slightly out of position..a pain, but I don't bother with it much when I'm driving. Sound is fine..I think if folks have trouble with sound at high ranges they should adjust the EQ settings on their iPod."
3,Very good reception but terrible LCD display,"This is the best FM transmitter I have tried to date - so far I have had 2 iTrips and one iTrip LCD - all quit working after a few months or made loud static noises when I passed a TV station or Telephone company HQThe Kensington transmitter has worked very well so far with the best sound quality of the 3 FM transmitters I have triedHowever, the tiny black on yellow display is near impossible to read, even at night - finding a frequency is as much luck as guesswork, but I have not had to reset it after the initial setup so that is a relatively minor issue (for me anyway)"
5,Works better then expected,"I had purchased this as a replacement for another transmitter than I crushed by accident, and it has been great. The wire that plugs the iPod into an outlet in your car is long enough to allow you to put it up on your dash or on a seat, without having to fight for it. It places all the audio controls on the car radio, not the iPod, so you are not driving and trying to run your fingers over the iPod wheel to make volume changes.As noted in some of the other reviews, not being able to use the full range of FM channels is a bit annoying, but I have found two stations in my area that work out great.As a side note to showcase how nice this transmitter is, my wife was in my car when I had it plugged in and said ""Man, I like yours better."""
1,Defective,This worked very well for the first 2 weeks. Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers. I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars.
2,Not suitable for acoustic guitar vocals,"I am returning a 33185 Digital FM Transmitter that I purchased because it produces very predictable static following certain lyrics. In addition, simply moving the cable introduces static.This problem seems strange because I live in an area with clear channels and I use it in a 2-seater convertible so there are no issues with interference, signal strength or signal path. Other digital FM transmitters (costing much less) do not have this problem using the same clear channels.I ordered the unit because it allowed me to eliminate a cable and a charger. My current digital FM transmitter requires that I use a separate charger and can access only 6 channels.If you like folk music, ballads or similar popular music, it is likely that you will be disappointed by this transmitter."
5,Good buy,"A lot of people like to use the Bluetooth version for their vehicles but I prefer the plug in version because 1) It won't go past the front seat 2) It charges while playing, which is a big plus for me if I am making long trips and want to play my IPod with full battery when I arrive at my destination. The simplicity of the thing is another big plus; especially for those of us who are electronically ignorant."
3,OK but the cord is a weak link,"This product worked very well for about 9 months (5 days a week, daily commuting). The cord on the side of the piece that plugs into the cigarette lighter started ""pulling out"" almost immediately, and now has frayed. This fraying / lack of connection started causing a lot of static about 3 months ago mainly on the right channel. (may explain another reviewer's experience of static). Now I am not getting the right channel at all.I need a new FM transmitter, but I doubt I'll buy this one again."
4,"It's Not Perfect, but...","The Kensington Digital FM transmitter isn't perfect, but I don't think a perfect one exists. Nothing can replace a direct input ($$$$) or using the car adapter into a tape deck (2nd best alternative, but who still has a tape deck?), but for what it does, this one works really well. Every once in a while I will have to change the frequency I am using due to some static, but one of my three presets usually does the job. Only on road trips is it common for me to have to alter my presets, which seems normal. I've seen some problems on some songs where there is an overaccent of S sounds, but I'm not looking for Klipsch level sounds here. If I wanted the best possible sound I could get, I wouldn't use a transmitter at all and I'd go with a direct input. For folks who want to bring their musical library in the car and be safer about it (not wearing headphones), this was a great buy. I am very pleased with it. Highly recommend."
1,not a good idea,I recieved the transmitter and it didn't work and when I called the tech support they were not helpful either.
5,"Simple, easy, gets the job done.",This device works just as advertised. Changing the frequency is easy to do and the sound quality is as good as analog FM can sound.
2,Basic,"Only if you never worked with SCADA it will help you start, found kind of outdated, but in fact lots of SCADA systems out there are outdated itself, so it helps to understand some old stuff."
3,Le Hidden Agenda,"The book is pretty good for what it says, but there is this weird vegetarianism proselytizing that eventually gets to be a bit much to trudge through. If I'd wanted a book on vegetarian French, I would have searched for one. Which I didn't, but I got one anyway -- which left me feeling a bit tricked. It's not that I'm so anti-vegetarian or anything, it's just that this book didn't advertise itself as having an agenda outside peppering your conversation with snooty phrases.I guess that's what I get for trying to enhance my faux snootiness, lol! Ah well, c'est la vie..."
3,Review,I no longer write reviews for products I buy at Amazon.com. I have found that if the reviews are negative Amazon invariably finds some reason not to post them so it is a waste of my time.
3,comparison with Plantronics 510,"This headset is almost weightless and extremely comfortable. The reception is very good. The only drawback is that occasionally it has to be reconnected to my cell phone. It is not necessary to go through the whole pairing process, but it still takes time. The other drawback is that my Blackberry 8830 seems to crash whenever I try to answer a conference call with the headset on. This may be a problem with the phone and not the headset. The Plantronics 510 holds the connection much more reliably and has excellent reception, but it is heavier and not quite as comfortable."
5,The Great American Poem,I know this was an accumulation of Kerouac's observations from the early 1950's until 1957 written in little notebooks...writings that capture the detail of the world (mostly America) as he mentally photographed it and transcribed it ( as a writer's exercise or batting practice)...and I know that he took all these observations and typed them up as a manuscript titled book of sketches...But upon reading this...this stands as the greatest poem ever written about America...
2,The One Decision,"I got the feeling that each chapter pulled up short on specifics for the sole purpose getting me to attend the author's seminars or sign up for expensive coaching sessions. Also, I think you had to read the first book about ""soft addictions"" to know what they are. Not a keeper! --goes to the public library immediately!"
5,One of the Most Important Books I have Ever Read,"This book takes self help to the next level. As soon as I started reading, I knew it was going to make a real difference in my life. It did. It built upon many things I had already learned and opened my heart and mind to new opportunities and insights.My one regret is that the book is not available in digital format. Some of my younger friends prefer an aural experience and dislike picking up a hard copy to read. Their misfortune, this book is not to miss."
5,ezxcelent,"very good product, I recommend ... In addition to being very responsible people when making shipments. I recommend it 100%"
4,very good.,"Packaging was very good. The product was secure and well protected when it arrived.The installation was very straight forward. I use windows 7 and at presernt Fsx.So far, no complaints...very smooth and the sensitivity is almost on par to the real thing."
4,Saitek Rudder Pedals as advertised,"I use the saitek rudder pedals with a saitek Pro Joystick and everything works as advertised!The install went smoothly. I use them with FSX.Construction seems to be of high quality.The adjustable control knob in the middle of the pedals does a good job of adjusting the tension on the pedals.Getting the toe breaks to work in FSX took a little trial and error, but does work.I would recommend these to my friends."
3,Gets the job done,"Good pedals, just a couple problems. They do not come with carpet spikes, so they slide around on thick carpet. Also mine are a bit looser when pushing the right pedal and firm pushing the left. They need in game deadzones also because it doesn't completely center itself."
1,Not as expected,"Purchased this item to go along with other flight simulator items and needless to say, I was disappointed in this product. Installation was a piece of cake, but the actual product works nothing like you would think it would. Sure it looks great and goes well with the rest of the decor, but the functionality has a lot to be desired. I set it up as directed and even had to go through fine tuning it via advanced settings and it still does not perform like it should. There is lag time, and it seems to think that when I push a pedal to turn it makes things stop instead. Not happy with it at all. I will stick with pretending to use rudder pedals on the simulator and using the real ones in my own plane."
3,good,"product ok, exactly as showed in pictures.Tension adjustment really works.but would be made more ""hard"". it looks like a toy..."
1,Not easy to colour,The design and cover is good but the out line of the mandalas is too bold not easy for coloring. Not worth to get one for coloring but if you just one to keep the mandalas design then go ahead and order one.Thanks
2,"Drawings are too small, but here is something you can do","The detail in these designs is both complex and a bit sloppy. Don't even think about trying to use crayons. And even with colored pencils things will be way tight. So as a conventional coloring book this one fails, badly. But there is something you can do.Take this book to your local office supply store. Pick out your favorite couple of images and have then enlarge them onto *photo paper*. Then grab a set of theseBIC Mark?it Permanent Marker Color Collection 36ct. We discovered that photo paper and these markers allow you to do both detailed work and to vary the tones for each marker. I've seen some really impressive stuff done using this combination of media. Oh, and you could try that combination with a better coloring book as well."
2,Sketchy line quality not so great,"I have just purchased several coloring books for use in my classroom. Some are optical illusion books and others have hidden pictures. This book is the only one I am disappointed with. The biggest problem it has is that the lines are fuzzy and not ""closed in."" I understand that the drawings of the artist show some real talent, but to make these into something to color is not practical. I think that it will be very frustrating for anyone to try to color these objects. I will keep the book, and may give it away as a gift. I will not be able to use it in the classroom because I know the kids would find it frustrating. If the lines were ""clean"", this would be a worthwhile book. Another problem is that unlik other optical illusion coloring books, this one leaves a lot of empty space on the page; in other words, the pictures are relatively small compared to all of the space on each page. This book has a lot of wasted empty space on each page."
4,Great little router .....but.......,"I was given this router as a gift from my husband. I love it except for the following: I have fairly severe arthritis in my hands and it's nearly impossible for me to try to hold in the button while holding the router and tightening the collet with the wrench. For those of us with arthritis or limited strength in our hands, using 2 wrenches to tighten the collet is so much easier. I wish Bosch would rethink their design.Update 2/6/2010. I wrote Bosch about my problems tightening the collet. Lo and behold--they sent me a little wrench to use with the other wrench. I can now easily tighten the collet using both wrenches! Too bad they don't include both wrenches in the original box, but I'm just happy that I can use this router with no problems. Thanks, Bosch!"
1,Ruined a project,I've only used this router a few times. I was going to put a very light chamfer on the edging of a front face frame. The motor assembly slipped inside the housing causing a large gouge in the workpiece. This happened so quickly that there was no chance to stop it. The front and side of the assembly are probably ruined.
4,Great knives,"Super sharp, but a few weeks after I got them, one of my knives had pitted and got rust stained. I sent it back to Shun and got it replaced, no questions asked."
5,This is the best thought-provoking guide to enlightenment.,This book shows the process of awakening to youself. From the moment you begin to question who you are and why are you here.. you are shown the steps that occur on your way to enlightenment. Wonderful and easily read. Makes sense for an enlightened person to translate another enlightened person's work!
1,A big disappointment,"When I heard this CD, I cringed at just how awful the vocals are. I just don't think that 1980s neocalssical metal works with nu metal vocals. When the rapping started on the song Punk, I knew that Impellitteri had decided to worry more about making money than keeping to the style he's been know for since 1987. If you're into this fusion of old metal music, and nu metal vocals, this is the CD for you, if not, skip it, it's not worth your money!"
1,I don't get it!,"I bought this book after reading the review for it in Select magazine (written by the same fellow who wrote the one on Amazon, Dr. Paul Dorsey). I could not disagree with his appraisal more.In short, I found the book useless. The author's treatment of the material was, in my opinion, superficial. As a businessman, I needed to understand the value of the technology and to get an appreciation for Developer issues. I simply couldn't get this from the book. The book's style was high-handed and the author appears very satisfied with herself and her accomplishments, although she shares little insight given her ""years of experience."" Obviously, this is a technical person who is trying to impress beyond her capabilities.I am puzzled by the dramatic difference between my impressions and the other reviewer's impressions. I hope he doesn't mislead others into buying this essentially useless book"
2,Ancient Rome,"I was very interested at the beginning. However, with no map avialable I was a bit lost. The characters never seemed develop into interesting people. The premise was good but I never could finish the book as I just didn't care enough about the main characters."
4,A Great Read,"All of Saylor's books are really good reads. They are set in ancient Rome and are written so as to make the reader feel that they are in ancient Rome. It's as if you can even smell the air in the markets. Saylor is really a scholar of Ancient Rome, but also an excellent story teller. I highly recommend."
4,To dub or not to dub,"Actually, I'm I big fan of Fred Ladd's dubbing team for Tezuka's series from this period (Gigantor and Astro Boy), so I'm not so upset at the lack of a Japanese track on this. In Ladd's interview to the Gigantor DVD set he talks about the fact that the episodes were mildly recut, so having English and Japanese as an option would not be possible, because they would not stay in synch.I do wish more of an effort to find the English language version's negative had been made. These are merely serviceable DVDs --- not quite as awful as dvdreview.com's review indicates (the 1st episode starts out horribly, so perhaps the reviewer didn't keep watching to see the mild improvement!).I think fans can proceed with caution as to the video quality, but ultimately live with it. Hopefully, as with Gigantor, a second volume will follow."
2,Very cheaply made,This product is very cheaply made. It only lasted two days before it ripped at the seams and was unusable. Pretty disappointed!
3,Great idea but...,We have a 14 week old Lab puppy...I bought this but turned out to be a waste for us... don't use it anymore (anyone want to buy it off us?)I learned quickly that water gets dirty immediately. Every time they drink bits of food get into the water.So this means the water needs to be dumped and this is really hard to do with a big jug of water. And alotof water spills out trying... which is a waste.On the food side... worried that the food won't be fresh sitting out versus closed in the bag. Also withour puppy we can't tell how much he ate. I don't mind him feeding all day but I'd like to know if he'seating too much or not enough.
4,NICE FOR ANY TRANCE LOVER,"This Compliation is without a doubt pumpin'! If you enjoy trance or progressive techno you would like this> A nice set to see live but the next best thing is right arround the corner! So for any party kid, raver, or club head get ready to bounce with these nice tunes!!!!"
3,Only useful if you're a fan of the series...,"Now that the Left Behind series has finished, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have gone back to the time prior to the first book. The Regime: Evil Advances picks up from the first prequel and continues the story to a point close to the original Left Behind installment. While much better (in my opinion) than the first prequel, this one still didn't do a lot for me. If you're a fan of the Left Behind series, then you'll probably want to read it to understand the characters and their motivations more completely. If you haven't read the series and have no intention to, then this isn't a book you'd care for. It starts off with an assumption that you read the first prequel, and it leaves you hanging in a strange place at the end. The only way this book makes any sense is if you keep reading into the next installment.Ultimately, I still think the series should have stayed finished without the additions to the prequels..."
3,Entertaining Addition to the Long Series,"This novel was an entertaining entry in this lengthy series. Though I don't agree with all of the religious dogma presented in the Left Behind books, I do enjoy the story. Some of the content matches with my personal spiritual beliefs, and some does not. I am now reading the last two volumes in the series. I like the characters and the extended plot. After many years, I look forward to completing the final volumes.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, ""To Be Chosen"""
3,Settle down people it is just a book,"I do not think this is the best book of the left behind series BUT it is enjoyable. I look at Rafe's family as a family in crisis. Irene learning to love Christ truly could make her fearful for her family's salvation. Don't take the book personallly, love it or leave it. I will read the final book, but we got the point. The end is near. I loved reading these books about rapture but it all boils down to you either learn that Christ is your savior or you'll be ""left behind"". (and a little money making involved). The book is OK."
2,A sad and bitter book.,"Reading this book, I was impressed by Pavarotti's patience with Mr Breslin. It is clear that the man was driven by money and, notwithstanding his repeated claims of affection towards Pavarotti, his book shows little evidence of any true ""friendship"". So Pavarotti was not perfect! Big surprise! He was a typical tenor and behaved like one and he was the greatest. He ranks up there with Caruso and Gigli; he gave everything for his fans and his fans loved him, warts and all. I finished the book feeling a renewed sense of affection for Pavarotti and a gutsy dislike for Mr. Breslin.A work inspired by bitterness and best avoided."
1,Exclusive [...] Hasbro get it right [...],"Sorry! fellas, I agree with J.cochran If hasbro is going to create an exclusive toy variant it should be accurate down to last detail. This toy maker makes millions of dollars a year and then scimps on the decals for this exclusive starfighter. And then there is the droid, wrong color, and wrong decal, WRONG DROID![...] for that matter. And no the head gear dosen't fit correctly or maybe I missed that part in the movie, you know,where the mouth piece sticks up Obi-Wans nose, and then fell off his head. If you are a collector these things do matter because details are everything if it isn't accurate then it's not exclusive, just a poor attempt. Hasbro get it right![...]"
4,"Overpriced, but good.","Crosman guns aren't the greatest, but they are good. This gun is the classic EBB (second trigger safety, bananna stick type 15 round mag, no magazine release, 120ish FPS, high lemon rate in manufacturing) except way overpriced. A friend got this and a mini for Christmas 3 years ago. The mini still works and this lasted 2 and a half years. The gun doesn't hurt at all if you don't use .2g bb's (Crosman and KSC bb's work best.)Spare mags are riddiculously hard to find, but well worht it if you're using it for anything outside of your backyard.The most impressive feature of this gun is that when the batteries are running out, the slide cycles just as fast as when the batteries are fresh in the gun. On other EBB's, the slide cycles slower and slower as the batteries run out.Anyway, this gun is good, but the $45 price tag is imbecillically high. Get it at Wal * Mart for $20.A springer would be better, but for an EBB, this is remarkable."
2,Hung Out To Dry,"I am an NCO in the US Army and am currently deployed to Kosovo. I purchased a Sony VAIO GRV670 notebook to write counseling's and awards for my soldiers; I also use it for recreational purposes, ie. games. My computer was running great for just over a month before I encountered problems with my display while trying to run the same 3D games that I had been playing all along. The problem got progressively worse as time went on. I have contacted Sony in regards to the problem and have done practically everything to resolve the issue but to no avail. Sony tells me that the computer is only guaranteed to run the software that comes with the computer and that they will do nothing for me. To their benefit, none of their software requires 3D or is particularly demanding on the video card; therefore it runs their simple programs just fine. So now I am stuck with a not completely functional computer, or rather, an overpriced word processor."
2,Low quality DVD.,"These Kimba DVDs, made by Rhino, were very low quality. The picture is very faded and dark. No restoration work was done at all. Avoid these and get the Ultra Edition Box Set or the Kimba Mini Set."
3,OFM,"well constructed product, but instructions lacked clear defined installation descriptions. Many pages but few clear picture figures. Also, found it difficult to setup the climber settings for multiple different users. Experienced simular issues with a previous purchase of the Bowflex Pro.."
2,Very disappointed!!!,"I have read every book in the ""Prey"" series and I found this one very difficult to finish. The story line is far fetched and boring. Usually I finish a book in about 3-5 evenings and it took me more than 6 weeks to finish this book...."
2,2.5 stars,"The premise of this book was just plain silly. It might have worked for a book set in 1988, when Lucas was still a young homicide cop, but didn't go over well in the mid-2000s. Soviet spies had their day. The Cold War is long over. That said, I think Sandford did a great job with Carl. Being a teenager is tough, but it's even harder when a man like his grandpa is pulling his strings.This wasn't a bad read, or poorly written, it was just goofy. That goofiness left it feeling like it didn't really belong in the Prey series."
2,Hidden Plot,This is the first of the Prey Series. Where the climax was totally uninteresting and without surprise. Which was terrible compare to John Sandford other prey series. I have to concur with the others this was a bust. Wait for the next John Sandford novel.
4,Hidden Prey,"Interesting story line, well developed characters and plot. For an abridged version well worth the price."
4,The streak continues,"Man, you would think that Sanford would run out of new things to put Davenport through - wrong. This one is purely for the readers who have followed Davenport throughout. And for the new readers - this is what good writing and plot movement is all about. For many reasons, I found this book to be the best since Certain Prey. Police work is top notch, very funny, good descriptions, some old characters popping in, and Davenport doing Davenport things. This series has been so good to me I sometimes forget this guy is fictional. Why not 5 stars?? Sanford has written better (Sudden Prey, Certain Prey), but nevertheless still better a LOT out there by far."
2,Hidden Prey by John Sanford,"While the story line was interesting, it took far too long to tell the story. Could have cut in in half to save slow moving and boring parts. This one I could have done without. :("
1,Hidden Prey,"I have read and enjoyed the previous 15 books in the prey series, but this one I just could not get into and was not able to continue. I read about 40% of it and it just was not grabbing me so I quit. I will read the next one because Sandford is a good writer and I like Lucas Davenport. I think the international flavor was not my cup of tea and being Russians - old news. Just fell flat for me."
2,The Seventh Horse,I was looking forward to reading this after reading The Hearing Trumpet and admiring her work as a painter but found this one a little too out there and difficult to relate to.
5,Great single,These are great exended remixes of the album version. I wish they would come out with a new album
2,Burger book,"I never actually received this book. The stock listing was incorrect so I received something else instead. They were, however, very cooperative in sending me a label to return the incorrect item at no charge to me and my account was quickly reimbursed for the book I did not receive."
3,What's the big deal?,"I confess I didn't read the liner notes or even attempt to decode any political messages in the music. All art is influenced by politics (whether Homer or Shakespeare, Griffith or Eisenstein). The real question lies in whether the artist's sources of inspiration have resulted in the creation of truth and beauty. To my perhaps over-experienced ears ""Witness"" sounds less cutting edge than reactionary, as the polyphonic, polytonal textures evoke the serialism and aleatory music introduced by Schoenberg, Bartok, and Stravinsky almost a hundred years ago. The importation, from time to time, of doctored narration into the sound mix might evoke a later composer such as Stockhausen were it not so tame. Listeners who are attracted to this sort of thing should definitely check out some of Ken Nordine's ""Word Jazz"" (unaccountably ignored after decades of non-stop inventiveness). All in all, a pleasant and interesting if youthful compositional effort."
5,Only His,I receive the book timely and excellent cover and printing.I will keep this and the others in this series forever.
5,Wonderful Story,"I checked this book out from the library and intend to buy it soon. I will look forward to reading it again and again. I liked how Willow was strong and didn't back down in many cases where others would have. I liked how honorable Caleb was about honoring his sisters death. I like how the story unfolded and the description of the land. I like the ending, it goes beyond just the where other book go. It told me everything that I wanted to know in the end, and now I can picture them. :-)"
4,Very enjoyable,"This was one of Lowell's first novels I read. It was a fast read because it was difficult to predict what was going to happen. I enjoyed Lowell's writing style. I do not like wimpy characters and Lowell places both Willow and Caleb's personalities on the very strong willed side. Lowell pays attention to detail and her description scenes are well written. This book will go on my ""will read again"" shelf. I look forward to reading all of Lowell's books."
5,Prague Tales,My wife & I had a wonderful 2 week apartment stay in Prague Sept 2012 Part of my prep is to read some literature .After struggling thru 4Kafka works & the Forrest Gump like Good Soldier Svejk books I thought I was immersed in the culture.While practicing my Czech the more English fluent Czechs admired pronunciation proceeded to conversations in colloquial English.One of them suggested reading Neruda.While familiar with the name his works were not mentioned in guidebook sections of Czech literature..My interest peeked I ordered 2 books which were home on return .Very interesting reading mostly 8-10 page vignettes of mid 19th century life in Prague mostly Mala Strana.Having just returned from our magical trip his writing brought back very vivid memories of our trip.Especially after the mind throbbing experience of Kafka & the Soldier Svejk always landing on his feet Neruda was very refreshing.Leave the Czech psyche to Culture Shock Czeck Republic & enjoy Neruda's every day life writings .
5,great book!!!,My granddaughter absolutely loves this book and the adults do also. Great story and cute illustrations. I would highly recommend this book--I have since given this book as a present to two other children.
5,Llama books,I ordered this book and another llama book for my youngest grand son. HE REALLY LOVES THEM BOTH. He likes them so much that I have another set ordered for him to take home. The first 2 I ordered stay at Grandma's house. I keep hoping I will see another different one on Amazon. I will keep checking back!!!!
5,Fun to read!,"The rhymes make this a fun book to read to my 3-year-old. He's not one that fusses over going to bed, so it probably is more fun for me than him. When my 18-month-old gets a bit older, this will be the perfect book for him!"
5,Wonderful Book!,"This is a fantastic book. It became an instant favorite with my daughter, who was 9 months old when she received it as a gift. She is now 11 months and carries it to me over and over. It has wonderful cadence and rhythm, not too many words to a page, and bright, vivid pictures. Although some of the reviews suggest that the story is about a neglectful mother, I found Mama Llama to be very loving. She is teaching her son to be independent and to understand that he is loved even when his mother isn't cuddling and coddling him."
5,Llama Llama,This book is great; it is a favorite in my family and at the preschool I work at. Highly recommended!
5,Loved it!,I don't like writing reviews but this book was well worth it. I loved it not just for my son but for me as well. I thought it was an excellent read and I loved the constant rhyming of Llama Llama Red Pajama. Excellent book for newborns up to 4 or 5 yrs.
5,A Hoot for the whole family!,"I sent this to my nearly 2 year old grandson right before he started a new day care situation, Not only did ne love it; so did older brother (5) and Dad and Mom."
3,Office of the Holy Spirit: A most necessary study for all churches by Rische Beeson,"This is an incredible way to fund the church coffers at $12,000,000 per copy. I hope you sell more than you give away. Way to go, Rische!!!"
1,Not Accurate. no customer support,Told to monitor BP at home and DR. recommended HoMedics brand. Bought this item and found my BP was sky high every time. My wife is a nurse so she brought home the real BP cuff and stethoscope from her office. We compared the HoMedic's numbers against her readings and found this model the BPA -100 was 12-20 point higher on the both the top and bottom numbers. Went to the manufactures website for support and found the bare minimal of information.Returned item for refund.
2,Cuff size in description is inaccurate,"This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close."
2,Fashion Coloress,"This coloring book was a disappointment to me. Although the pictures are detailed and accurate, I would not recommend this book as there is a much better, more current version by Ming-Ju Sun that is much better and more fun to color. From a purely historical standpoint, it's great. From a the standpoint of one who loves to color fashions, forego this item!"
5,E is for Enjoyable,"As Sue Grafton winds her way through the alphabet, her stories are getting better and better. I have read up to ""V"", her latest, and can't wait to read the rest."
1,Extremely Unpleasant to Use,"What a disappointment! It did a poor job, and got too hot to hold. I know you get what you pay for, but this is truly aweful."
5,"Not the original, but great anyway!","This album is great, I could'nt find any mention in here, but all the songs are actually from spanish group from the 80's ""Mecano"" (hence the name of this album), If you like this you should really listen to the original."
1,Not quite the book for 'the rest of us',"After seeing nothing but high end kitchens in most books, I really thought this would be the book to help those of us who don't have huge budgets. Unfortunately, I was very wrong. Wolfe ranges, Sub-Zero refrigerators, granite counters and backsplashes aren't mainstay for the 'rest of us', yet these high priced appliances and finishes fill the vast majority of the kitchens in this book.This book was a huge disappointment, I won't make that mistake again."
4,Good GED Prep Tool,"This book is very user friendly. It does give the answers on the same page as the questions, which makes it necessary to cover them in order to use the book to its full potential. I think it should give more background or more detailed information about some of the questions asked. Sometimes the answer is not found in the article and if you don't already have a science knowledge about what it is talking about you will never get the right answer. All in all, it is not a bad tool and the questions like I explaned above are few."
5,a must for all moms,"This product is a must for all moms i have had this book for many years, and i recently purchased it for a friend who has kids and is always asking my advice on how to remove this stain, or clean this or that. majority of my answers come from this book. she said it was a great mothers day gift."
3,Something is missing,I read the previous edition of this book and I thought that I should buy it as a reference. There are several chapter about ratio and the author uses real life example from the financial statements of both Hasbro and Mattel. The things that shocked me is that the financial statements are not included as they were in the first edition. Instead the author invite you to get them from their website. Not really convenient.
5,Simple introduction on how to read Corporate Financial Reports,"I give it a 5 as it really does explain in details how to read the financial reports. And is particularly doing a good job at explaining it for ""dummies"", so, you would not need another book or other references to decode those reports after reading the book. However, sometimes it feels like repeating itself, but it does that so that everybody can follow up the explanations."
3,"Good for a narrow audience, but not quite what I need","This is a good book for those dealing with public company financial reports. However, I needed something to help with private company and insider reports, thus most of the book is wasted on me. The helpful parts are a little thin."
1,DISAPPOINTED!!,"My motto when it comes to music purchases you don't preview are that you win some and you lose some. I lost big time on this one!!If you're looking for a Carribean style trop-rock CD this is NOT for you. As a fan of the ""Thongs in the Key of Life"" and ""Margaritaville Cafe"" Cd's I thought I'd take a stab at this one. Sure wish I could have previewed it first.A couple of prior reviews use the phrases ""exquisite beauty"" and ""A better singer than Jimmy Buffett"". I'll admit Buffett isn't the greatest vocalist but I don't find someone who sounds like Bobcat Golthwait emitting ""exquisite beauty"" in any of their songs.The only thing this Cd gets points for is some of the humor in the lyrics, but other than that this Cd is not play-worthy. Parrotheads/Trop-Rock fans.......save your money and skip this one!"
1,Unbelievibly Horrible,"This is absolutely the worst CD I have ever purchased. I am in the process of trying to return it to Amazon.com. It has no real sound, the music is awful and you can't make out most of the words. If this guy is supposed to be the next Jimmy Bufffett (and I am a big fan of Jimmy's - I have all his CD's), then the music industry is in real trouble. I gave this CD a one star rating only because it was impossible to give no stars!"
1,Powell's Predicate,"Firstly, to compare Roosevelt's New Deal with Stalin and his purges and brutality demonstrates an ignorance of history that is breathtaking.Secondly, I'd like to see all these revisionists give up their social security, their protection under FDIC, their protection from the SEC, the infrastucture built by the WPA....oh yeah things were just grand before we had child labor laws, minimum wages, insured bank accounts, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, rural electrification and collective bargaining.Thirdly the banks collapsed before FDR became president"
1,In line with NeoConsevative propaganda on FDR,"Amity Schlaes, Powell and others have only one goal in pushing their thesis trying to distort the facts about the New Deal. The government is bad...period! Regulations shouldn't exist if it'll help ordinary people. In the vein of Grover Norquist, the want the power of government to be reduced to nothing else than being a conduit for the powerful.They must be very well financed to have so much time on their hands just to try to falsify the historical record.Cui bono?"
1,Right Wing Propaganda,"That's all it is. It has become fashionable among the ditto heads and fox news fans to hammer home the idea that the New Deal was harmful to America. This is their sole mission. They want nothing more than the elimination of all social programs, including social security. The campaign is similar to the disinformation campaign pushed by the so-called ""Intelligent Design"" lobby. Repeat the lie often enough and eventually people begin to believe it.This is propaganda. Save your money."
5,UK artists do cover versions of US hits of the fifties (and some original UK hits).,"This disc predominantly contains cover versions by British artists of American hits of the 1950s (see my explanation of this in my review of the other disc mentioned below). It also contains some pure gold all-UK hits though (""China Tea"" by the immortal Russ Conway for example).However, this is basically a repackaging of an early 1990s compilation released through the now defunct Castle Communications - both discs have exactly the same track list (ignoring the numerous spelling mistakes and truncations in the track listing for this CD!!). However, the other disc can be got at rather less. Search for Amazon ASIN B00004SFD5 to find ""Hits of the Fifties"".This one has nicer artwork though 8-)Alan T"
4,"A fast, entertaining read...","I love a good,light read... and though ""Beautiful Stranger"" was indeed light, it definitely was not fluff. Marissa has struggled with her self esteem her whole life...all that she really wants is for someone to really see her, not just her face, her body, or her money, but her...inside. Along comes Robert and wow, he is just what she needed. I loved that this book focused on their liking eachother, not just craving eachother. This is the kind of book that can be devoured in one sitting. It is full of likeable, realistic characters that I feel sure will remain in love once the luster wears off. Not quite a keeper,but definitely worthwhile."
5,Bel Canto's Best,"This is a must have book for the novice through advanced singer, it shows the fundamentals and advanced techniques of the most famous and timeless method of singing. Marchesi and Miller teamed up for an extraordinary work on the art of singing. Explained in a easy to understand manner, the method makes the art of singing an effortless skill that can be easily learned by anyone with the will, and wants to experience and enjoy the benefits of the art of singing."
3,Small Problem,"I love this as a duty flashlight, but the rubber button that covers the switch is soft and flimzy, not as I remembered my prior maglites had."
3,Great with Caveat,"I bought 2 of these 4C Cell flashlights and they are awesome like all Maglite's are. But I also bought the TerraLUX TLE-6EXB LED upgrade kits and when I went to install the LED's the retaining collars were incompatible with the Terralux kit and I say SHAME on Amazon for recommending those LED's when they wouldnt work with the Flashlight as is.Fortunately, since I was hell bent on enjoying the 140 lumen LED in my 4C maglite I went hunting collars and I found directly from the Maglite company through consumerlink.com that they offered the proper collar for order cheap. So, I bought a handful to never have this problem again. I will report back when I have the new collars in and cover how well it works. In the meantime;DO NOT BUY TerraLUX TLE-6EXB LED upgrade kits WITH THESE FLASHLIGHTS>"
2,Big let down,"After reading many of the reviews I was expecting much more. This was a simple Nancy Drew style book with a travelogue spin. If this is what you are seeking, I recommend it. If you are looking for a good mystery, skip this book."
5,A great teacher!,A great way to learn the fundamental principles behind chess. You can learn a strategy and go over a game of Paul Morphy. Apply the things you learned from this book and you will definitely see your game improve!
5,Vegetables exotic and domestic and historic origins,"Excellent color photos and descriptions of vegetables both common and specialty types. Includes geographic and historic origins of those cultivated. Also includes information on many plants eaten as vegetables, but primarily found in the wild. Broken down by vegetable. Very easy to read. Includes information on common pests and diseases for the home gardener and the pictures and flavor descriptions are great for planning your garden."
1,"ginsberg, the hysterical social man","Jane Kramer doesn't know enough about poetic history, which makes this book unreadable. Ginsberg's exploits in America will pale, in the end, to his few poems of meagre merit. I didn't know this book was now out of print. I suppose that is a good thing, and makes any attempts at discrediting it pointless."
4,Nice Jewel Cases,I love the clear cases which are easy to see for use as cd cases and I plan on using them as frames for Vacation Bible Schools next year.
5,Very interesting and informative!,"Really interesting and detailed explanation of what each aura color means...including how one's aura color may impact one's childhood, relationships, occupation, and parenting style. For anyone interested in exploring auras and their meaning, this book is a great place to start!"
5,"Nothing fancy, but they do a great job","I ordered a these in May 2008 and they arrived in a timely manner. All 36 spoons came in great condition. I divided them up with another family member since I didn't need that many. As you can see in the picture, these are not fancy at all, but they are sturdy and functional. The overall length tip-to-tip is about 7 3/4 inches giving the spoons a nice long reach. I do recommend these."
4,Basic CCNA Study Books,As usualy these books are good and help assist your training to get your CCNA. As with most Study books it's dry but full of good material. I would reccomend these for anyone wanting to get their CCNA.
3,Really fell short of 640-801 version,"Just like his previous works, Odom writes a comprehensive but very dry 640-802 Certification Library. Which I have always found a refreshing style. The major problem I have with this edition of the cert library is the lack of after chapter questions that were featured so prominently in the last edition. Basically if you could answer these questions without looking, the CCNA was a piece of cake. You could really tell that care was taken to prepare and pick these questions. Also the new chapters really kind of stick out. There is little effort in them to really reinforce the learning with repeated references to key topics that Odom pulled off so well in previous editions.Overall the lack of review questions and polish in the new chapters really give the reader a sort of ""rushed"" feeling."
5,An Easy & Enlightening Read!,"I must admit I bought it because of the cover and what was said on the inside of the jacket, but when I started to read each chapter I couldn't put it down! The best part is that each chapter is only about 5-6 pages long. Depending on what you want to reference, whether it's ""exercising your risk threshold"", perseverance or sharing your life's blessings with others you can go straight the particular section that interests you. I also loved the fact that Frank believes in giving back to those who are less fortunate than him. Frank's book really provides a balanced approach to life. I would recommend it!"
1,I want my money back!,"I purchased this book because of the claim on the back cover that the topic of getting your digital images into a form that can be printed using conventional analog darkroom techniques was covered. It is very hard to find information on this subject anywhere in the vast library of books covering the subject of digital imaging. The introduction to the book states that in chapter 8 ""You will learn about getting your digital images into a form that can be printed using conventional analog - silver based darkroom techniques. This includes examples such as making 4X5 negatives and transparencies from your images."" Guess what - there is nothing in chapter 8 or anywhere else in this book that discusses these techniques."
2,I have been asked to review this product,"This is not a reflection on the seller. I saw no evidence to suggest it wasn't newBut after about two weeks, the control unit died and would nolonger ""link"" to the track.I sent it back to the manufacturer for replacement or repair as per their instructions. It has been three weeks. Still wailing... Not heard a word."
3,Good book but,It really annoyed me that there were so many non spaces. Therewasalotofthis going on and it would distract me from the story. Is it really that hard to put in some spaces!?The story was cute and I liked it a lot so I would recommend it but it seriously sucked with basic grammar.
5,Fun Toy...not worth Amazon's High $$,This is such a cool set. Definately not worth the (high)Amazon price tag though. We bought it locally for a much cheaper price.
4,Neat gift.,Bought this for my 8 year old grandson's birthday gift. He loves it! He spends hours creating and constructing.
3,"Good Value, but batery life is show","It works as fines with a few cavets, the batery life is about 4-8hr by itself. It will also only work with Mappoint 2003 thru bluetooth since it cannot dial down to 4800 bps when in connected thru the USB. Still it is pretty good for the price."
2,A long read,"""Seasons of Her Life"" is an interesting biography about Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The author of this book, Ann Blackman, did a wonderful job examining the finer details of Albright's life. Blackman interviewed numerous people, including President Clinton, and other close friends and colleagues of Albright, which helps the reader understand the importance of Albright in the worldwide community. Yet, all of these interviews and information are buried in the back of the book. Blackman spends too much time focusing on Albright's father, Josef Korbel, and how Madeleine Albright's family ended up in the United States. While this information is important in understanding why Albright believes in the politics that she believes in, it does not do the reader any good if they cannot get through the inital chapters. This is a well researched and through book on Albright's life, a decent book if you do not get lost in the history."
2,I've read better biographies,"The book is O.K., but it rambles on and on about many irrelevant details of Albrights life. Many curious questions remain: why did Albright ""forget"" that she was Jewish? The author addresses this issue in only a cursory way."
3,Rember what it is!,"Keep in mind this is around 35 years old. It's funny, moves along pretty well, is relatively short episodes, and decent action. Certainly worth checking out one of the DVDs."
5,What a Blessing,Dena's book was the perfect thing to read in the car with my 3 kids. She has a way of making the reader understand that all moms go through struggles- even the ones who make it look so easy. I couldn't turn to the next story quick enough. I can't wait for her next book to come out
3,Histories' Miss-stories!,"I bought this book, after I glanced at it quickly, thinking I would really enjoy it. After buying it and then sitting down with it, I quickly realized how much DC Comics history was quickly skipped over or ignored all together. Many, many events, locales, and characters are completely dismissed and golden age (1938-1958) events, etc., are pretty much rejected in place of more updated revamped characters. Not really what I was looking for in the way of a DC Comics Encyclopedia. It's full of color and nice artwork friends, but lacks in the substance category.Do yourselves a favor...purchase some DC Archives and really enjoy the history for yourself."
5,LOVE IT,If you love DC comics you will love this book! This is much improved from the origional encyclopedia. we have both!!!
4,Interesting,"I wasn't going to give this five stars, however as someone who has grown up with DC, it opened my eyes to that world. Good reading however, it just goes to show that there are a lot more heroes and evil types that no one thinks about. The minor characters were what interested me, their past and present situations are what may draw one in to the DC world"
2,Noble Effort Falls Short,"Deepa Mehta is a gifted director, and her previous work is highly noteworthy (""Earth"" being the most obvious example). But this was a disappointment on practically every level. The timing and delivery of the actors was awful, dialogue was canned, and production values fell short. Examining the cliches of both Bollywood and Hollywood and looking at South Asians in Toronto in a wry, self-reflexive way is a great idea, but the movie was so awful that none of that was achieved. Noble effort, but believe me, you don't want to waste two hours of your life watching this. Hopefully it was just an anomaly and her next one will make up for it (and she is genuinely talented, so there's no reason to think it won't)."
3,Short on song and dance--that's the ultimate flaw,"Many of the other reviewers will list the many faults in the plot. Finding a lack of verisimilitude in Bollywood films is not that difficult. I judge my Bollywood experience by how many dance numbers are in the film: the more there are, the more I like it.When all is said and done, the few dance numbers in the film are good ones--even the drag queen sequence is a lot of fun. I just wish there had been a few more. I didn't even mind the on-screen kissing or the news of premarital pregnancy or the idea that the beautiful star was a prostitute. Go with the times if you must. I just wanted more song and dance."
5,Panasonic KX-TG5634M,"These phones have meet every expectation. The speacker feature hasworked well for a family member with hearing aides. The handset""blinking"" for message feature is also one of my favorites. Wehave purchased two KX-TG5634M for seperate locations in the last6 months. Both are functioning as expected. I highly recommendthis product and believe it meets its advertised claims"
2,bad karma but,"I agree with the minority opinion. I work at a newspaper. Every week I receive poems from young people, as sappy as MS's and as heartfelt. We publish them because we are a family newspaper that serves mostly small communities. The kids are happy, the parents pin them to the fridge, and we've done our good deed for the day.BUT they do not deserve book publication. They are cute, they bring a smile to your face, but that's all. They have the depth of a Triscuit. They vanish from your mind as soon as you turn the page. So it was with this book.I wish the child nothing but the best in his journey. But I can't help wondering if he is being exploited. If he had the talent of a young Rimbaud or Dickinson, I wouldn't mind. But so far, he doesn't."
3,Doesn't play nice with vitamin D,"I think this stuff works? Its hard to tell. I don't notice a huge difference. I looked into Fulvic acid while dedicating a lot of time to researching and testing a candida diet. I'm still testing it all but every time I take either vitamin D in a liquid form or capsule along with this stuff, it makes my stomach upset. Its weird. I guess its one or the other. Too bad. I guess if you're generally healthy to begin with this would make more of a difference with energy and all but unfortunately I'm still in search of what I'm sick from and how to fix it."
1,Garbage and fake,"There is nothing except water and some tree leaves in this worthless sediment filled douchery, I work out and know my vitamins, go to thevittaminshoppe or gnc, our get alive liquid minerals because they are real!"
2,A disapointment,"Video only fair to average, audio fair, content interesting for one viewing but not a DVD which one would view over & over. We anticipated more action but only saw snippets.The cover notes are both incorrect and misleading. It claims ""Full screen"" implying to me it is 16:9 format. It is not, it is 4:3 and should have clearly said so. It also displays the ""Dolby Digital"" logo implying it is 5.1. It is not, it is very ordinary stereo and should have said so. The Amazon description is accurate and clearly states the format and the audio configuration so these notes are a criticism of Columbia Tristar - buyers in shops could be easily misled.John"
5,History matters,"I read this about forty years ago and never forgot it. It truly encapsulates the horror of civil war - family fighting against family - what could be worse? It is timeless and shows how we are interconnected. Sometimes looking back, can give us a better perspective of how to move forward."
4,easy and cheap way to do analysis,"Quite possibly, the typical Social Work student is not from a strong mathematical or computing background. But she is often expected to understand and apply common statistical analysis on data, especially if she is a graduate student.Patterson offers a relatively easy approach for her to acquire this knowledge. By using spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel. Or, for that matter, she might even use the free OpenOffice spreadsheet. These now come with many common statistical functions, to compute mean, standard deviation and other metrics. Plus, a spreadsheet can often display tabulated data, in various graphical forms, like bar graphs or pie charts. There is no need to learn a language to find the statistics, and another language to graph the results.Another benefit is that the spreadsheets are now widely available on many personal computers. Hence, what she learns here can be easily applied elsewhere."
5,The Adventures of Jonathan Craine - GREAT CD!,"Thing That Goes Bump in the JungleThis cd is really produced well and has a nice full sound to it. The adventure is about a ""rotten"" boy who gets transported to the jungle to learn some awesome lessons. He makes friends with a lot of great animals (some good and bad) and they tell stories and songs that teach a lot of great values. It is wonderful for road-trips, or snowy days or quite times in the house. A fun alternative to tv and the music is very fun and well written - my children like to jump on our mini-trampoline while listening to it. Jonathan is a likable little boy who soaks in all the lessons and makes your kids want to also! About 40 min. long."
2,Questionable Reading,"Having read Judith Riley's very fine ""The Oracle Glass"" and the overly complicated but entertaining ""Master of Desires"", I looked forward to reading ""A Vision of Light"". To say I was bored throughout most of the book is an understatement as I found myself skipping pages and pages of dribble dialog, only to find some worthy parts scattered here and there, and finishing (finally!)with a very disturbing ending.I believe this was Riley's first book and her writing improves with her later works, although she fails throughtout all of them to take a breath and FEEL what she's writing. Riley is apparently is endowed with a great force of mind but it's my opinion she needs either to be edited down, or exercise some self discipline in overburdening her reader with endless language and plots, that weaken the emotional impact of her stories."
3,Cheap but okay,I used to have aquariums when I was younger and I never saw airstones as cheaply made as these. They disintegrate if I try to remove it from the tubing. Wish there was more options on Amazon at the time I purchased this.
4,una voz increíble / amazing voice,"Acojonante la voz de este hombre. Yo lo he descubierto con Masterplan, geniales, pero este trabajo en solitario es la hostia. Musicalmente hablando quizás no tenga nada nuevo, pero su voz tiene algo que hace que te enganches. Recomendado."
3,"A short review of the ""Scorge of God"".","A quick easy read. The author dwelled on the conditions of both Western and Eastern Roman Empires, and less on the life and abilities of Attila. Book puts to rest that Attila had more reputation than actual cruelty. Attila was made out to be blood thirsty barbarian, when in actuality he was tolerant of different peoples and ideas."
1,The book should have an editor nefore its publication.,"This is the worst book I have read in many years. Without any doubts, it contains some useful information. Yet the book was not organized to offer cogent narration, let alone argumentation. It should be edited before its publication. If there were editors for it, it could have turned out to be a good one. I was disappointed and felt that I should not have bought the book even at the reduced price. However, I will keep on looking for another ""Attila"" since this man was an important figure to have changed the world."
3,fair,"Not the best book I have ever read, not the worst either. Guess it falls somewhere in between. Does not come close to being great literature--then again, it would be unjust to call it hack work. Mildly entertaining, would be closer to the truth.See the movie. The black and white photography, small town feel and some of the performances (you choose) make the movie work better than the book (even though the flick itself is way overrated.)"
4,About as good as you can expect,"My biggest gripe with this thing is that it's a pain to clean, but that's what you have to expect with one you can't wash. You have to use a little brush and it doesn't feel as clean.Other than that, I've had it about 6 months now and I still like it, but it doesn't cut as well as in the beginning. I've been very impressed with the battery life thus far. It's better than the old single blade razor I had, though it's still obviously a low end mid-range razor. I'm sure you could find better for another $10 or so, but if this is one you're planning to use maybe 6-9 months or so and you can put up with cleaning the thing with a brush, it's a pretty good deal."
4,"Fast write, slow read","These worked well for my cd-r drive which is a 12x10x32 Lite-on. Mine burns cd-rw @ 10x and it works at that speed. Pretty good! Of course, almost all cd-rw disks read at much slower speeds than cdr disks. Most of the time cd-rw read at 8x (depending on your drive). Most cd-rw drives do not specify the speed at which it reads cd-rw, if your doesn't, it's probably reading cd-rw's @ 8x. These memorex disks are the first CD-RW disks with both, 700MB capacity AND high speed 4-12X. If you have a drive that supports higher than 12x, you should purchase memorex's ""Ultra high speed"" cd-rw which allow writing @ 12-24X. They come in red box instead of blue."
2,Save your money.,I have used this product in my car for the last 2 months. It is totally ineffective. I wasted over $40 for the purifier and the delivery cost.
2,Snooze Read for Sure,"I'm an English teacher, and therefore will pretty much give any book a chance. I must say, I want the time I spent reading this book back, because it was totally not worth my time. I would have rather graded papers, and that's saying a lot. The author has this ability to explain every single minute detail, which does no more than unnecessarily prolong the novel. Seriously, this book could have been 100 pages shorter, if the author had not added in so much extra random stuff. I was about 40% through the story and still had no idea what the actual mystery was about, had no suspects, or any motive for why two characters were dead. All in all, I'm definitely not giving any other stories in this series the time of day."
1,Too soft,"Way too soft, it doesn't do what its supposed to do. After I put my had on it falls flat and doesn't support my neck."
3,Definatly not for the beginner!,"I bought this DVD looking for a challenge - which this workout certainly is. Unfortunatly, Dolphina spends too little time explaining the moves and too much time talking about the ""goddess within"". Although the setting of the workout is lovely, I find the bright white background and the glittering water a bit hard to look at while concentrating on the moves.I would only recommend this workout for those who are able to pick up new moves quickly! I am a intermediate level belly dancer and I have had trouble catching on to the moves. I find myself going over and over the scenes to catch the correct movement. More time could be spent explaining the mechanics of the move. That said, I was looking for something more challenging than the ""Neena & Veena"" workouts, and this workout fits the bill. Whether or not the moves carry over to my dance class remains to be seen!"
1,Horrible Filming,It is hard to see Dolphina's movements because it is filmed from far away. On this DVD Dolphina is on a big white block of ice and she wears the same workout outfit. Seeing her on a big piece of white ice is very distracting. Stick to her Basic video it's fun because she had beutiful backgrounds and wore different bellydance costumes. This one is awful.
5,THIS TART PAN ROCKS~,"THIS PAN, MAKES THE BEST TARTS YOU WILL EVER HAVE... DOES NOT STICK TO ANYTHING, AND THE BOTTOM COMES OUT WITH A BREEZE! I DO HAND WASH IT, JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE!!!"
4,"Simple, bittersweet, and thought-provoking.","There is nothing earth-shattering about this novel except the unusual clarity of Kosztolányi's descriptive powers. More so than the novel Anna Édes, however, Skylark puts a burden of thought onto the reader. Kosztolányi only narrates, offering no judgements or opinions, and so his narration is very focused. The translation preserves this and is generally praiseworthy; Kosztolányi's characteristic terse, direct style and colorful phrasing come through unscathed.This edition has a nice 10 page introduction by Péter Esterházy, which gives interesting information about the author as well as some background information about Hungarian literature. The cover and binding are, in my opinion, quite handsome also."
3,More expensive than originally thought,"I print over 10,000 pages per year and it turns out that I'll need to replace the drum unit just about every year. That's over $100 per year extra cost. I think Brother is one of the only manufacturers that has a separate toner and drum units. HP, Samsung and other printers have both toner/drum in a single cartridge and the price difference between Brother's toner and other manufacturer's toner/drum unit seems minimal. Hence, I'll end up spending quite a bit more during the year than I originally thought. Over the years, I've owned many printers, ones from HP, Samsung, Brother and others. I've been very happy with HP and Samsung, but not so much with Brother."
3,Where's the USB cable???,"Honestly, I have no idea how good this BROTHER printer is because, lo and behold, the dang package had no USB printer to computer connection cable included!I needed to get right to work, and that's why I bought the unit, but now, I have to wait another week to take delivery on a USB cable.(Unless I want to buy one from Radio Shuck at a rip-off price of $36 plus tax!!! (Another place to avoid, unless you do your homework)BUYER BEWARE!"
5,This Business Book Should Be Required Reading,There are few business books that I can give 5 stars to. This is one of those few. I would make this book required business college reading if I so had the power.
4,This is an excellent,I loved this book. I found it hard to put down from the beginning to the end. I love this author. I can't wait until her next book.
3,Poor quality tire,"I have been riding the bike only a couple times, and just found out yesterday that the front tire tube was leaking! Same problem happened with my husband's(we purchased them at the same time). I am very disappointed with Jeep products."
5,Another Cat in the Hat DVD!,We love the Cat in the Hat and have purchased all the DVD's that we can find. Love this one.
3,Average Marketing Book,"The author is obviously very knowledgeable and a good business consultant, but I found the book spent too much time telling the reader to make sure he/she had a unique selling proposition and unique business that wouldn't go against the big companies in the industry. I think this is useful information, but not for this book, I would have rather seen it appear in a basic ""how to"" business book for small companies.He does give some very useful information about Internet marketing and talks about applying generally accepted marketing principles to the Internet, which are ok.I think the title fits when it says ""planning"" strategy and helps the user to just that, but stops short of giving really concrete information to act on or execute the plan once it is done.Overall I think the book was just average. Not terrible, but not really great either."
2,Burpee Soil Tester - Readings Unreliable ?,"I tested a variety of soils after creating a slurry of each sample, and the pH and fertility readings didn't move appreciably from the off position.I then tested a sample of red wine vinegar and the pH reading was off the scale on the high pH end (just the reverse of what I expected for an acidic solution). I tried again using a slurry of soil I added vinegar to with similar results (High pH reading) ???Does anyone else have any experience with this tester ?"
1,just the opposite,"I purchased the Burpee electronic soil tester and no matter what soil I tested the needle basically stayed at 7. Next,I did a controlled test with vinegar and the needle went to the far left indicating extreme alkalinity! Washed off probes and ran soil tests again and needle stays at 7. I tested same vinegar with a ph test strip and it meas. <5 which is the lowest reading the strip is capable of. Obviously this Burpee tester is useless."
1,the lies continue,"...""Why do Rose et al find it necessary to reduce a perfectlysensible belief (that complex wholes should be explained interms of their parts) to an idiotic travesty (that theproperties of a complex whole are simply the sum of those sameproperties in the parts)? ""In terms of"" covers a multitude ofhighly sophisticated causal interactions, and mathematicalrelations of which summation is only the simplest.Reductionism, in the ""sum of the parts"" sense, is obviouslydaft, and is nowhere to be found in the writings of realbiologists. Reductionism, in the ""in terms of "" sense, is,in the words of the Medawars, ""the most successful researchstratagem ever devised"" (Aristotle to Zoos, 1984)."""
2,Centred on the English language,"An essential aspect of the shortwave listener hobby (=DXing) is to know all of the broadcasts of the international radiostations, not only broadcast in English.Good selection of sw receivers."
4,Probably the best shortwave buying guide available,"The Passport to World Band Radio book series is great for honest and very crtical reviews of shortwave equipment. I bought this (2006) edition along with the WRTH book of the same year and I found the information in the Passport book to be considerably more interesting and up-to-date.Indeed I'd say their shortwave radio reviews are almost too critical. However, I prefer their harsh reviews over other sources that seem to like everything.Whether you decide to save a few dollars buying this older edition or choose to buy the latest ""Passport"" book, you can't go wrong."
3,Won't work for iPhone with Otterbox,"I saw several reviews saying this would work just fine with iPhone, however if you have an Otterbox or other bulky case, it will not connect. Just FYI. Seems like a great product, but won't work for us unless we want to take the case off, which won't work with my husband!"
4,Very Good purchase for me,"i use this product basically everyday and it works pretty well, sometimes the signal messes up for a few seconds but for the price i couldnt care less. i found a station that it works for that has another channel on it but that station is not strong so my ipod can come through, the battery life is fine i only take a little bit out of my ipod battery so i dont mind... overall i really really like this product but for the signal i guess it may depend on where you live"
4,Great buy,the title says that it works on the nano but it worked on my iphone and itouch 4. I got my moneys worth.
5,Awesome product,"Came fast, purchased for 5 bucks as used but came in sealed package and works really well! I know others that have had trouble with radio station clarity but this is crystal clear!"
4,Lots useful advice and common sense,"I found this book really useful and could not stop wondering how could so much common sense escape my understanding before? Ms Ryan's advice is pretty obvious, however, here we are doing it wrong once and again. I can't say this book is responsible for me getting or not getting interviews so far, but at least I now feel confident enough to think I'm sending a decent cover letter. If you think that this book is going to make the process of cover letter writing faster and easier, you'll get disappointed since it is rather the opposite. But what has to be done has to be done and at least now you know. I didn't give it 5 stars because it gets too repetitive, full of examples that are great, but as usual, there may be one in twenty (if any) that even resembles one's own situation.http://diaryofajobhunter.blogspot.com"
5,Should be required reading for health care practioners and industry execs,"""Your Inner Pharmacy"" is a real eye-opener, especially for those of us reaching middle-age and facing the prospects of diminished health and reduced activity levels. It doesn't have to be that way! Dr. Blaich does a great job of explaining how incredibly inter-connected our bodies system's are, and the simple things we can do to maintain our own health and vitality.I truly wish this book were required reading for health care industry professionals and health care practitioners. There are literally millions of dollars in health care industry cost savings in these pages.My family and I have been patients of Dr. Blaich's for several years and he has helped us manage our own health in ways we never would have understood if we had only followed traditional medical approaches. This book gives everyone a chance to better understand their own wellness."
2,Go Back Across The Burning Sands...,"Didn't Terry McMillian do this some years back with Waiting To Exhale? I found this book to be highly predictable, too over the top and amateurish. This was quite unimaginitive. Might make an interesting Lifetime Television Moment of Truth Movie. Should they make it into one, watch the movie."
2,Disappointing,"This mud pan does what it is designed for and does it well. The rubber bottom gives you a solid, comfortable, insulated grip. It held up very well to water andcleans up easily. The edges are straight with no damage whatsoever."
1,"Like husband, like wife","Oh my, this book should be titled ""The gas we pass"", with my apologies to the writers of the book ""The gas we pass."" I only wish I could have selected zero stars for rating this book--what a bunch of garbage. I did a bit of research on the author, she is no doubt under the influence of her husband. Apparently the Wilson's run a ""Branch Davidian"" like church in Moscow, Idaho. My husband loves the various ""submission"" elements in this book, as other reviewers noted this is one for the boys. It is a funny book, in a weird, freaky, mind control type of way. I can only imagine the sex life of this poor deluded woman.....Bottomline: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Drills they use bend very easily,Not impressed by the materials or workmanship of this countersinking set. The drill bits they use are made of soft steel and bend very easily. And the counter sinks were not sharp and left burrs around the hole from the get-go.
2,Doesn't Stick,"I cleaned my desk before I put the mouse pad on it so I would have a nice dust free surface to start with. It was sliding a bit right away but seemed to stick a bit after using it for a while. I've had it for about a week and it no longer sticks to the desk at all, just slides all over the place. I kinda want to give it more stars just for looking nice and I liked it for the brief period where it was working well. What it comes down to is it doesn't do the one thing well that it's supposed to, it doesn't provide a good surface for the mouse to slide on.UPDATE: I cleaned the back with some Windex and it sticks a little better now. I tried with soap and water first and that didn't help at all. I changed my review from one star to two."
2,Short term product - slides around after a few months of use,"This mousepad is fine and the surface works well for tracking my laser mouse. However, after four months of use, the bottom is no longer sticking realiably to my wood desk -- meaning that often when I move the mouse, the pad slides with it, and the pointer goes nowhere. This is very frustrating and the reason it's now in the trash."
1,Terrible.,"A mouse pad should do two things: 1) Stay in place. 2) Let the mouse laser do its thing and ""work.""This mousepad fails miserably with #1 and gets a ""C"" grade in #2.Avoid this product.(Used in a computer lab with iMacs and a variety of mice)"
5,The Alchemist- Glenn Gould,"I bought 2 copies , one for me and one for my relatives in Alaska, who are also fans of Glenn Gould- we all loved it! Anyone who enjoys the music of Glenn Gould will want this dvd! Bill"
3,PNY Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX 768MB Graphic Card,"Worked ok for a few months and then quit working. Got another one and it worked ok but the graphics still lagged. Ended up getting a newer model and that one works great, although it did require a new motherboard and power supply."
3,Disappointed,"Couldn't wait to receive and watch this DVD. Turns out, I was disappointed. My fault though. For some reason I thought it was a documentary, not a concert. Was looking forward to some Neil Young history and past concert footage. Don't care for his new music and there is too much of it on this DVD. I was bored half way through..."
1,Poorly produced concert... what a shame!,"Except for the dated 30 year old short video clip with Neil singing an older song... the rest of this DVD is one of the most poorly produced, poorly filmed DVD's I've ever listened to. The audio mixing was horrible and Neil Young never sounded worse... in my opinion. I hate to give a review of this nature to one of the best songwriter/singers of our era, yet this appeared to be a rushed and botched concert."
5,Neil Young - Heart of Gold DVD,This DVD was given as gifts. I loved it on A & E so I had to get it.I bought new ones and they arrived in excellent time. Never had to go to the mall. Great way to do business for me.
2,Mediocre,"""Prairie Wind"" is one of NY's more mediocre albums and this DVD only reaffirms that. I found the DVD contrived (especially the last scene with NY alone on stage). In spite of all the rave reviews, it's not all that good."
1,How long does it take???,"I've been using it for over a week now, and it still hasn't helped my ingrown hair from coming out. Either I have some really deep rooted hair or this product isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Save your money on a dermatologist.Zero stars."
5,Buy it! Must buy!,"I am planning on running a DL campaign using 3e rules but after reading the campaign setting book, I had a lot of questions. One example - do all wizards of high sorcery have to specialise?This book answered all the questions. It is quite literally an extension of the campaign setting book (think of it as book 2).More classes, races, prestige classes, etc More magic items, more history, more info in general, FANTASTIC art (MUCH better than the art served in the campaign setting). Infact the art is the best I've seen in any Dungeons and Dragons (3rd edition) book to date.I loved this book more than the campaign setting itself and it was this book which really sold me on the idea of a Dragonlance under the 3rd edition rules.Highly recommended. Especially so if you buy the DL Campaign setting."
2,"I like the texture, but...","within a few days, I started breaking out with little white bumps all over my forehead and chin.When I first used it, I found it to be really hydrating yet not greasy. I really wanted to like it because my skin felt really good at first. but then when the little bumps started showing up, i started getting worried. i kept using it for another week, hoping that my skin would get used to it, but it never did. so i stopped and teh bumps disappeared within 2 days."
1,Couldn't stand the fumes!!,"We bought this border along with the crib bedding set. As I was putting up the border, I noticed strong glue fumes. I finished the room, with the windows open, hoping that the fumes would subside. No such luck, after almost 3 weeks, the fumes were as strong as ever. We had to remove the border. There was no way my baby would spend one night in that room!!!"
5,RAED MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,I thought The eleavator family was a vary good book. I enjoied the book. It was a funny book. It has really good detal. Ithought It deserfs
3,College Algebra,"When I purchased this book it was a little confusing when it came in because it has three different covers. Looks can be deceiving, because all the information inside the book is the same."
1,Another gimmick to make money,"If the doctor tells you the same thing in person as in the book, then I might think it was helpful, but since most doctors aren't honest when it comes to lasers, I know most of the facts in this book are not necessarily true and aren't what the doctor actually tells you in person. Lasers are very invasive procedures that can cause permanent damage."
2,Value added < 0,".. the benchmark being SAS/ETS documentation. Let me recommend printing out selected chapters of SAS/ETS User's Guide - available online - describing the procedures that you (may) need, such as MODEL, FORECAST, ARIMA, VARMAX, UTC and STATESPACE."
1,Screen is too small and needs a back light!,"Screen is VERY difficult to see and too small. There are eight contrast selections and not one of them works for me. This was a gift and it is a great idea, but I need to find one with a larger screen."
3,CAR COVER,"USEFUL, BUT DURABILITY DOUBTFUL IN THE LONG RUN. MATERIAL WATERPROOF BUT THIN. HEMMING ALSO QUESTIONABLE AROUND DRAWSTRING. MIGHT BE BETTER TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND MAKE YOUR OWN IF THIS IS GOING TO BE USED BY A CHILD OFTEN."
3,One Down Fall For Us,"We have had TWO of these panini grills in the last year. I began noticing the non-stick finish flaking off. I brought it back to the store and they gave me a new one to replace it. Here we are, 6 month later and the same thing is beginning to happen. We uses our grill often, 3-4 times/week. For our family we cook 7-8 sandwiches for one meal. I am now on the hunt for a grill that can hold up to our usage with out feeding us it's non-stick coating. Other than this issue the grill worked great."
2,Poor quality,I was pleased with its performance until it broke after only 10-12 uses within 13 months. Hamilton Beach should provide me with another one for free. Their idea of a free replacement is that I pay $13 for shipping and handling. That is unacceptable.
4,Hailton Beach Panini Press,"I was using a George Foreman grill to make panini sandwiches but it took too long as the grill did not get that hot. This press heats quickly and gets much hotter, it works quite well."
1,Very short life span,"As stated in other reviews, this product is very good while it works, but stops working after very limited use. We owned ours for less than six months, with minimal use, before it unexpectedly stopped working. I do not recommend this product."
5,Great terrarium!,"I love this terrarium. I bought this for one of my arboreal tarantulas and possible communal setup. It holds humidity very well and can hold quite a bit of substrate, more than enough to keep live plants, and allows easy access to do any maintenance my tarantula might need."
3,Nice idea but only decent execution,"While this skin is nice and for the price probably worth it, the skin makes the buttons hard to read/use. While I know the camera well, whenever I give it to someone else to snap a picture, they end up pushing the ""off"" button instead. Very frustrating sometimes. Anyway, it's a decent buy for the price, but also doesn't cover the lense or anything. I'd get it, but don't expect too much."
4,Those were the days when players were illeterate-uneducated young men,"This book was written by one of the most famous baseball writer of the early 20th century. However, it's not a book about actual events by real life players.It's about a fictional character, a player from the minor league who gets promoted to the majors. In form of multiple letters to a pal, the character explains his life and hopes of being in the major league and his fear of being send back in the bush league.It's quite reveiling of the days when players were illeterate-uneducated young men who were at the mercy of the owners. On that basis alone, the book will instruct you as good as any other book what was life back then."
2,About dogs in general,"I am an owner of two Sibes and know they are very different to other dogs. This book is directed at dogs in general and NOT in particular to the very special bread of the Siberian Husky. Therefore, I did not find it very useful and found the writing to be rather dry and uninteresting....."
3,I am stillwaiting for mybook,I can't review or post my opinion because i am still waiting for my book.
2,Poor Quality...,"This bag is everything I needed and was happy at first. But with in the first few months the bag literally started falling apart. I only use it to bring to work and some vacations but for the threading and the side pockets (for water bottles/drinks) are completely torn up.I would say this is from wear and tear, but this poor quality bag went straight to tear.In addition, the strap always seems to be getting knotted up. Its not a swivel, which makes it quite annoying to straighten everytime i use it."
4,Nice Bag,I got this bag to replace a 10yr old backpack. Its a good bag. Of all the currier-type bags I liked it the best. its big enough for a full size laptop and a couple text books.After getting it I've decided I don't like the currier style after all. My problem with them is I can't get into it easily while its on my shoulder. With my old backpack I could just swing it around and unzip the pocket I needed.I do like this bag. Its built well and looks nice. I just learned that at least for me this style bag isn't what I like.
2,Big and Wide,"Maybe I should have read the reviews a little better but this bag is BIG!!! If you have a Mac I would not get this bag, your laptop will be swimming in it."
2,"Too Big, Poor Quality","I bought this bag to attend school. When i put books in it and put it over my shoulder, It made my arm go numb. When I began to take a closer look at the craftsmanship, I noticed the velcro on one of the inner pickets was loose. I also noticed loose strings all over it. I wasn't convinced It would serve my purposes, so I returned it. It did not appear as something that would last."
1,nice but too small,this product was smaller than expected ended up returnig it so if you are looking for it use for school would not suggest it
4,Sootroage Wars first episode of the series,Nice first episode of the iconic reality show. The characters are introduced to the audience and those who have see the later episodes can understand the dynamics better.
1,Dumb program,Not much to say except this is proof of the dumbing down of our country. I didn't finish the program.
5,One of my new favorites!,"This show ranks right up there with Ice Road Truckers and Deadliest Catch as really well done reality TV shows. Storage units that have been abandoned are sold at auction, and this show follows the 4 people who make their living by bidding on them, Jarrod, Dave, Barry and Darrell. The only thing people bidding on each of these units are allowed to do it take a quick glance at them from the outside, never opening a box or touching anything. Each unit is a gamble on what's inside and if the person buying it will be able to salvage anything to make a profit. Each of this shows cast members is very different from the others, and they seldom ever get along. This show is packed with all kinds of surprises, funny moments and lots of fighting. It's quickly become one of my new favorite shows and am hooked and ready for season 2!"
4,ah what a good era,"Well, this album certainly was worth the $10 Au I shelled out when I was on holiday last Christmas, I took it home expecting to like it, after seeing titles like ""So What"", ""Impressions"" and ""Walking"", but even though the quality is a little bit shabby (similar to the Blackhawk sessions), the style is the the end of his Classic Bop albums, turning in a new direction on ""Seven steps to heaven"".""On Green Dolphin St"" seems a little more hurried than on the Blackhawk sessions, still has that eery thing that moves me each time I hear it, especially the intro. Wynton Kelly, John coltrane, and Jimmy Cobb are exceptional here, not to mention the others (60 lineup- Miles,Trane,Jimmy Cobb,Paul chambers), (62 lineup-McCoy Tyner,Trane,Elvin Jones, Jimmy garison.The Last two songs are Coltrane on his own, stunning also. This rendition of 'Impressions' seems even better than some of the studio efforts. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed his 55-62 albums."
1,Another sales pitch type of book,"There has been a rash of sales pitches for expensive chat rooms and seminars disguised as books (see Velez' poorly written ""Master Day Trader"" book for another example) and This is another one.The book has a nice cover, great graphics. ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" fits perfectly. There was nothing advanced in this book, a lot of simple ""how to look at a trend"" type of information. Nothing on market maker plays or time & sales strategies.Another disappointing sales brochure disguised as a book by OTA. It's almost as bad as their level 2 spiral bound notebook (not quite as bad, at least this one doesn't have all the typos). Let's encourage book writers to Not promote their websites' highly overpriced services via their books... anyone with me on that?Look at books by T. Turner and J. Cooper instead... also check out Friedfertig/Nassar for good introductory books."
5,"""Majority Text"" is the generic MS family of the KJV N.T.","""Majority Text"" identifies the continuous-use family of Greek MSS (i.e. - Koine, Byzantine, Lucian, etc.), represented in 85% to 95% of existing MSS. The Alexandrian (of Egypt; modern NT's) and Western families represent the rest. The KJV translators used the Majority Text family generically, but specifically those MSS of Estienne, Beza, Erasmus, & Polyglott. The ""Textus Receptus"" was not published until 1633, by Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevir, in Leiden."
1,"Poor batteries, bad phone!!","Biggest waste of money. Phone is currently out of service after less than one year. Battery trouble, dropped calls and poor reception are the leading problems. With many years of great service from previous Panasonic phones, this one was a great disappointment!"
2,The battery of the phone cannot withstand 1 hour of continuous talking,"These are great phones, but I was stunned when I realized that they do not have belt clips on the handset. The phone has to recharged after every one hour of talktime for 5 hours to get one more hour. They have headset jacks, so Panisonic is well aware that people will be using headsets with the phones, but they didn't consider what you do with the handset when you are walking around with your headset on. It's really a pain, because the purpose of a headset is to talk hands-free and having to carry the phone in one hand really defeats that purpose. This small issue is enough to make me avoid using this phone in favour of my other set. It's concerning that Panasonic would cheap out on something this small."
4,Panasonic Cordless Phone with 2 Handsets,"Works great for my need. If you are looking for an extention phone sans answering machine, this is the one!"
4,No doubt about the sound quality of Panasonic phone,"I first bought a set of Simens cordless phones before this one, because Simens always creates such attractive appearance of their products. Honestly, I was just loving watching the phone sitting in my living room. However, after two-week trial I had to give it up because of the sound quality, noisy and far away, even though it still looked pretty... No matter how time changes it's always a fact that Parasonic produces the ""best"" sound quality of their phones."
2,Panasonic Speaker Phone,"I like the compactness of the phone; it is clear on both ends of the conversation. However, I was under the impression it had a speaker phone on the base (not just the handsets), so I'm a little disappointed in that. It would also have been nice to be able to see the screen or a blinking light which would tell you if you have messages waiting."
3,Panasonic Telephones,"All three telephones (one cordless) preformed as advertised except that the wall phone does not ""fit"" properly on my dsl connector - is ""loose""."
4,Good cordless phones,We purchased these for my elderly parents. They have been pleased with the ease of use and clarity of reception.
4,Here and Now very good book believable,Here and Now great characters all strong with great life lessons. Enjoyed the different twists that the story line had.
4,Six good chapters,"Do not be put off by the middle of this book. The good analysis of Chinese society is done in the three front and three back chapters. Don't feel guilty if you skip over the middle, it is all about ancient history, and the author herself writes on page 27 that the history of China as the ""Chinese Nation"" started only about 100 years ago.Julia Lovell makes a strong case that China will never stop building walls --- ""...the pull between enclosure and openess will continue."" (page 348)I subjectively subtract one star for the probably excellent padding in the middle of this book."
5,Adorable & Good Quality!,This is so small! I love it! I thought it was going to be bigger but I love that it's the size that it is. I bought it for my boyfriend because he's obsessed with airplanes and he put it on his keychain and loves it too. There is no back It's just empty but that's no problem. It's very good quality I believe and I dont regret my purchase at alll (:
3,Young Lady Chatterley 2,I alaways like those sensual dramas from the 1980 and 90's that seem more natural in comparison to the mayority of todays creations that are more in aming to the bizzard an in making the expresion sex sells the standard so they can sell anything.
1,"NOT WORKING AT ALL, PART MISSING, WANT TO RETURN",I received the order with a vital part missing. It is useless and I wish to return it and get a refund. Kindly let me know immediately how to handle the return.
2,It worked for a while....,"My husband and I purchased this printer last Christmas. It worked wonderfully at first and we were very happy with the high quality printing (especially photo printing).After three months, we encountered a recurring error message. The printer had a paper jam in the duplexer (WE DID NOT HAVE THE DUPLEXER ATTACHMENT). Shaking it vigorously and cursing at it worked for a while, but it eventually stopped working all together.After over an hour online with the HP help center (they were very nice, by the way), we found it was a ""hardware problem"" and that our warranty had expired (no surprise)."
2,"Good printer, be prepared to spend a fortune for ink","I replaced an HP DeskJet 850 with a 5650, thereby replacing the large HP45 (39 ml) color and HP41 (41 ml) black cartridge with the tiny HP57 (17 ml) color and HP56 (19 ml) black cartridges. Worse than that, this printer simply eats ink, even in draft mode. With the 850, I was replacing cartridges every 8-14 months, minimum. I replace the cartridges on the 5650 at least once every 2 months. These tiny cartridges also cost more than the larger ones.""View ink levels"" doesn't work if you connect with a parallel cable and seems to be problematic even with a USB cable.This is an excellent printer for the price (I paid $100), but be aware that the costs of keeping it in ink will significantly increase the total cost of operation compared to other printers. I would go so far as to say that HP is making printers like this to leverage their ink sales and has become somewhat unscrupulous in their methods."
3,"Great printer, nightmarish setup","I've just spent 3 hours helping someone connect an HP Deskjet 5650 to his year-old Dell laptop running Windows 2000, and after reading all the reviews on this site I see more than a few others have had setup complaints. It took over an hour on the phone to hp before the techie and I finally managed to get the drivers up and running, and none of the ancillary software is installed at all. It remains to be seen if this causes problems.Once installed, the actual printing is all you could ask for in a moderately priced machine--five stars, in fact. But it's anybody's guess whether you'll have no trouble at all or find yourself tearing your hair out. Caveat emptor!"
3,Problem with Win XP Prof Installation,"This printer worked nicely with Win 2000. It indeed gave very good prints, beautiful color. However, the driver installation got stuck and could not finish once my computer was upgraded to Win XP Professional. I tried many times and eventually gave up."
3,Nice action but not a classic. RENT,There were some great scenes here in this movie but it just didnt scream for something that was to be watched several times. I would recommend to rent it.
3,OK remake,"Updated but not better, and I was not really into the original.Good to see the Rock developing though. Would buy again."
1,Recycled plot + Wooden Acting + Bad Dialogues + No Jokes + Special Effects with mixed results = BAD movie,"- The plot has been recycled numerous times by other movies.- The acting is wooden.- The dialogues are bad.- The special effects are good in a few scenes. Most of the time, they look cheap and obviously fake. For example, the scene where the car collides with the boy is impressive. In other scenes, the effects look like a bad video game.- I regret spending money to watch it in the theatre with my friend."
2,One Long Chase Scene,"I was disappointed. The whole thing was one long chase scene. But, I'm getting older and expect more from a movie. If you like cars with chrome and other things just because they are shiny, this movie may be enough for you. To give you balance though, I like the original Disney movies better than the remakes. Younger people probably don't."
2,Air body saw,This tool doesn't work well at all. The blades last about a minute or two before you have to replace it. There may be some unique situations where this saw will be useful but I've not found it yet. An air powered grinder with cut off blade works much better.
3,Anne Mather,"Because Sylvie's selfish sister refused to give up her career and go to Greece, to live with her husband Leon and her small son who also needed her, Sylvie found herself persuaded to go there instead. And all she got by way of thanks for her trouble was the hostility and suspicion of Andreas Petronides, Leon's unbending brother, who refused to think anything but the worst of her, and was now doing his best to spoil her innocent relationship with Leon. Why couldn't he concentrate on his disagreeable girlfriend Eleni and leave Sylvie alone?"
2,"sturdy, hard to put into ground","My husband sprained his wrist, so I was in charge of trying to put this into the ground on our camping trip. It had rained the night before so the dirt on the ground was reasonably soft. I tried to screw the stake into the dirt, but it just wouldn't stay. I put all my weight into it and it just kind of grazed the top. The top handle doesn't have any sort of comfort - just a piece of metal. So unless you have a strong grip (I do not) this doesn't work very well. If it had screwed into the ground, I'm sure it would have held up since the metal seemed to be very sturdy."
4,"Excellent, but why not get a collection?","""A Dream of Fair Women"" is one of Alfred Tennyson's best medium length works. Among other things, it showcases his near-unmatched technical virtuosity, showing remarkable variety within tight rhyme and meter. It also reads quickly and isvery engrossing, unlike most poems of the era. One of Tennyson's early visionary pieces, it also has interesting content, featuring several famous historical and mythological women. Though at first seemingly less than transcendent, it allegorically explores love and dreams and comes to a conclusion more in line with present thought. The poem is essential for anyone interested in Tennyson, English poetry, or Victorian literature, but the fact that it is in collections with many other poems makes this slim volume hard to justify."
3,Fall into the Abyss of Erotic Horror,"A high school teacher, plagued by grisly dreams that begin to haunt his daytime hours, teams up with a telepathic woman to solve the dark enigma surrounding a series of gruesome murders . . . one of which involves a close friend. However, they might not like what they find beyond the nightmarish visions and mysterious killings. Ray Garton's Seductions is not his best work, but the highly visual, cinematic-like plot is involving. Likeable characters, tight yet fluid prose, and disturbing scenes are part of his forte, and Seductions contains them all. Those with weak stomachs should be forewarned."
3,Fodor's Singapore: Most Current Source for Singapore Travel,"This tour book was the most current I could find for preparing for my trip to Singapore last summer. I was especially happy that it was Fodor's that had printed this, as I found the Fodor's London Guide to be the handiest, lightest, and most helpful book in London. However, I found several things lacking, such as a listing of church service times, and also the little walking tours did not hold my interest or my boyfriend's. On the other hand, admission costs were extremely helpful, although the guide did not list places to purchase sightseeing packages. Overall, use the book for it's info on attractions, but don't limit yourself to the restaurants listed, and planning your own foot tours will be the most interesting."
4,A good memoir of a friendship,"You don't get much of M.F.K. Fisher's colorful history, any deeply revealed gossip or scandal. And you leave the book knowing that's exactly what makes this a great read. It's a chronicle of an always loving, sometimes difficult friendship, where the subject has definite boundaries you just do not cross. A lovely, if light memoir."
3,not good for a BMW motorcycle,"I purchased this plugs for bmw r1100r since the Autolite 3923 was highly recomended.However I highly advise against this ones.They work in the bike, work really well when they are hot.But:They heat up very slowly (~~ 15 minutes to peak performance) and while they are cold engine is very rough and idle is uneven. I tried meny different plugs in this bike and these once were the worst while they are cold.Once they warm up they work well, evenly and quetly."
5,Real- No Messing Around -Reading Here!,"This was not only a easy book to read and storyline to follow, but it draws you in and has you 'living' the situations as they occure.It 'draws' to that dark side, ( as well as the good ), of you and make's you scream 'Yea! Go get 'em!'This is a book I'll strongly recommened to anyone -wake up - and smell the gunpowder."
1,Had to return it,"My nephew is really into Star Wars, especially the vehicles, so I was excited when I found the action fleet series. I ordered the TIE fighter and the X-Wing and when they arrived I was surprised to see that they were is worn boxes with a copyright date of 1997. This didn't bother me at first, until I saw the ""Try Me"" opening on the side, which didn't work - I opened the boxes to replace the batteries and when I opened the battery casing to the X-Wing, the batteries were obviously old and replacing them did not help the toy work. For the TIE figher, it was worse - the batteries leaked and were fused to the casing. I would have actually been tempted to keep them if it hadn't been for the leaky batteries. What I can say is that Amazon's return center was easy to use and the UPS pick-up option worked really well."
4,Bee Keeping is Much More Than I Thought,"This book is one of the few I have a great appreciation for. Sue Hubbell has great patience in the process of making honey and watching the world around her. Her style seems easy going but really you learn she is always on the move.Hubbell's story is a very easy, simple read but it is a very enjoyable experience. I now have taken an interest in bee keeping. Although I might never pick up the career, her story has me thinking about things that never crossed my mind before, even though I've been exposed to it. Her description makes anything transform to something beautiful."
4,A wonderful book!,"I really enjoyed this book--the author chronicles one year of her life living in the Ozarks as a beekeeper. She uses a series of essays to share all the elements of her life--nature, social, emotional, etc. I have great admiration for this 50 year old, recently divorced woman who was able to enjoy and appreciate the world around her at such a difficult time of her life. She definitely has a gift for writing also."
5,This is a great book.,It is a very enjoyable tour of a small town/country life. Ms. Hubbell can really write. It is a nice piece of naturalist writing. I can't wait to read the rest of her work.
4,HAPF-22 Filter,"A good quality Hepa filter and the price was right. Shipping and handling charges were,however, excessive! I would not purchase from this vendor again because of the ""fake"" low price. $8 for shipping two small, light weight filters is far too much IMO."
2,Thought I reveiwed this already?,"When I received tese filters, they had mold on them and did not use them in unit in baby's room."
1,Misleading title,Becoming a Coach is only about becoming a coach through Coach University. It is a long comercial with very little useful information.
3,...using the Coach U approach,"As the previous reviewers have written, the title is misleading if not changed to ""Becoming a coach using the coach U approach"". Even so I don't wan't to be all critical. The book has got its uses, the question is if you want to pay for it considering the commercial aspect of the book. The book is filled with 'contact-information' on coaches who have graduated from the program. If you find someone with whom you share opionions you can try to contact them to learn more - I will. The book share some information about how a coach work, describes and includes two coach U models and a sales letter.It also mentions the three basic steps of coaching Who/What/How. I didn't by the book, I borrowed it..."
2,Be careful--It is NOT Wide Angle at all,I was expected per Advertising WIDE ANGLE but it was not.This is same as other Lense I already had.I was so disappointed about it>
4,Very helpful detailed informtion,The book was lacking specific information on how to deal with real estate investment
5,A very wise book,"Not only is Operation Charisma a thorough review of many aspects involved in the development of charisma, it is also a highly insightful manual on the underlying events that occur in human interaction. There is wisdom in the numerous examples which illustrate life situations where a more charismatic approach would have created a big difference. This book has truly helped me overcome my shyness and lower my anxiety level when addressing others."
2,Not So Silent,"I read the reviews for both the ""silent"" and non-silent version of this power supply and decided to spend the extra cash for the quiet version. The silent power supply functions fine, but it is by no means silent or even quiet. It's very loud. I can't imagine how loud the non-silent version is. The stock powersupply that came with my PC's case was much much quieter than this ""silent"" coolmax. If I had it to do over again, I would buy something else. I may even shop around for another and just keep the Coolmax as a spare."
3,Magnificent Callas and Di Stefano but very sloppy conducting,"I saw this one at one store in Oslo at half price, so I bought it with high expectations on especially Callas.Callas was as good as ever as Gilda. Di Stefano as the duke too was glorious. Unfortunately Campolonghi was not nearly in their league. He missed lines several times and he seems sloppy on his timing too in addition to some unsteady toneproduction. But the bad timing is mainly the conductor's fault. I had the feeling a couple of times that the orchestra didn't follow the singers with queer timing.But it was worth it for Callas and Di Stefano alone. Di Stefano's arias was performed magnificently and Callas' aria 'Caro nome' was the definitive highlight of the performance. The sound was acceptable and didn't have any surface noise."
4,A fantastic addition to your Italian cookery shelf,"This is a wonderful book, full of very interestingbackground into the cooking of the region and tothe personalities of the proprietors of therestaurant. While not all recipes are ones thatyou will make on the spur of the moment, many areworth the effort. I have thrown several dinnersof recipes from this book and they have won ravesfrom all attendees."
3,"Good book, but....","It's funny but I think they modify the recipes so they don't work out quite the way they should. You always hear about old women doing this,leaving out some ingredient or changing a quantity to keep it from being as good as theirs!In particular, the pasta frolla recipe, an essential part of many sicilian desserts, had 22 tablespoons of baking powder in it which caused tart crusts to puff up like a cake and not be flat. Checking many other sicilian recipes for pasta frolla there is no baking powder in it.Perhaps it's my lack of ability, perhaps not! But it created a Frankenstein tart that was still edible but more like fruit-topped dry cake."
2,Book does not cover Hypothesis Testing,The author does not get into statistcs - a fundemental part of a true six sigma program.
1,Peter's review,I thought that the book stinks from beginning to end. The last chapter was an abomination. I disagreed with every sentence in the last chapter.
3,Happy shopper,I was disappointed that the DVD did not come in the original package. I would have liked to know that it would come in a DVD mailing box only. I could have moved on to find one that would have the correct package.
1,How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,"This book is full of nonsense and distorts historic truth. I was told that the writer's relatives lives in Atlanta. If this is the case, a full investigation/background check needs to be administered. I wouldn't be surprised if the writer's relatives are connectioned with anti-American groups.This book is ridiculous."
4,exactly what I was looking for,"I have been trying to find these panties for ages and finally decided to look on Amazon-of course they had them. They came as described and shipped very quickly. I would have preferred to have been able to buy a 5 pack of all white panties, but at least I have the fit I wanted, if not the color."
2,hhmmm.....,"I was not prepared for the low quality fabric. The style and cut are great, but I am not sure these will stand up to too much washing. i was really disappointed in the fabric; reminded me of the cheap fabric I dressed my dolls in when I was a little girl."
4,Like them...,"Had some like these for 5+ years needed new ones. I purchased a single pair of another brand from a local merchant for $7. Didn't wear well at all. Couldn't find these locally. Ordered from NY Lingerie on February 5th and they arrived yesterday. Pretty fast. They arrived faster than the other item in my order. I was a bit disappointed there were no beige colored ones in the package, which is best with white or tan colored slacks and shorts. They fit perfectly. I am happy with this purchase and with the merchant's quick shipment. Thank you."
2,Great idea. Not the best keys / layout,"I like the concept of this keyboard. Unfortunately, I find that I can't touch type on it well. There is little separation between the shallow keys and I'm constantly hitting the wrong key when typing.It's ok for sitting on the coach selecting movies from Netflix - it's nice not to need a mouse. But, as another reviewer said, it's not a desktop keyboard replacement."
2,1 year later & still running,"I'm running this on my x64 Vista Ultimate, HTPC setup. The wireless keyboard works, even when I'm on the BIOS. I must have dropped this keyboard twice and it's still going. I haven't replaced the battery that came with it, after a year of usage.For the price and functionality, I rate this product 4.5 stars.***UPDATE***My second year with this keyboard, and I have to give it two stars. I have new batteries, but the range on this product is unacceptable. Over five feet, and I'm having issues. Even around 3-5 feet, some of the keys are not responding. I have given up on this product and will be getting something better."
2,Couldn't handle the smell,"I ended up having to throw these pills away because they made my entire apartment smell. I didn't really notice the smell when just hanging around the apartment, but it was very obvious when you first walk into a room. I tried putting the pills in a ziploc bag, but that still didn't help. The smell wasn't so strong I couldn't stand it when taking the pill, it was just nasty to have the whole apartment stink.As for them being easy to swallow, they are the size of most regular pills. Maybe a bit bigger. Definitely way smaller than most multivitamins but still not small. If you can swallow a regular pill, you can swallow these. But I have a hard time swallowing even small pills so these were too big for me. I'm switching to Flintstones."
3,it works ok,"this does work, but it is made cheap for the price they charge it should be made of much better quality"
4,Very Easy,"I planted a lot of butter beans this year and wanted an easier way to shell them. This little sheller is the the answer for me. Does a fast, good job. Even better if your husband helps."
1,No Graphic Clues for Little Ones,"Unlike the HighLights magazine hidden pictures, there are no picture clues in this book - or any other of the Highlights book series. Highlights magazine shows a panel of pictures that are to be found in the larger picture - a must until your children are at a reasonable reading level. There are only text lists of the hidden items. My two three year old granddaughters are accustomed to seeing picture clues in Highlights magazine, and cannot use these books unless someone sits with them and tells them each item they should be looking for, as they cannot yet read. Maybe a reasonable book for older children, but I have always found that once the children can read they usually lose interest in hidden picture books."
2,Mazes,"I was looking for a book of hidden pictures for elementary age kids. However, the pictures were too visually over-stimulating. There are too many things going on and it was difficult for my younger kids. Recommended for middle school to high school kids."
2,NOT SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY!,"THIS ITEM IS NOT WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY, JUST BUY THE SCAT CAT PRODUCT. THIS ITEM RARELY EVER GOES OFF, AND IF IT DOES, ITS A DELAYED REACTION! NOT WORTH $40.00!! I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AFTER READING THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS OF PRAISE."
5,works great,this product really works -- first use the air blast plus noise and then later only noise is needed --- now using to keep our cats out of the Christmas tree
2,Doesn't catch our cats,"I don't know if it's because our cats are black and the sensor doesn't ""see"" them, but our cats can walk right up to it and most of the time it doesn't go off. We walk over to check it and it goes off and sprays us. It's not working for us."
1,Wow. Way to not work at all.,"The sensor doesn't work well (I had to move my hand in front of it to make the 'sound'). The air doesn't spray, and if it's in that made it will just sound constantly and never shut off.Horrible item. Buy something else. Trust me."
2,Worked at first...,"I had hoped this would be a safe and economical way to keep my cats away from my Christmas tree.. and it worked for about a week. The whole first week my cats wouldn't go anywhere near the tree. Unfortunately the sensor on the StayAway is very unpredictable and if you were standing right in front of it, it wouldn't go off. But if you were halfway across (10-15ft) the room it would see your shadow and fire away. Eventually my cats became desensitized from the spraying and the loud noise because it was going off so often when no one was near it. So after about a week my cats were all over my tree again. And after about a week and a half both bottles were completely out of spray. So I gave up my StayAway idea and switched to scat mats, which so far (it's been about a month) have worked like a charm."
1,Poison Gas Inside - wish there were negative stars,"Purchased this with the intention of keeping our cat from urinating in a certain area of the house (and possibly use to keep out of the baby's crib). I thought that the can contained plain old compressed air. Unfortunately, it is not compressed air but refrigerant (like what is used in automobile air conditioning systems). I would not deem this safe to use around pets or put in the crib.Tried to return the product but it is considered HAZARDOUS materials. Don't purchase this poison for your house, it isn't worth the risk to the health of your pets or family members."
5,A retrospective,"It's hard to believe that these songs are as old as they are. I loved John Hartford from the time I saw him on the Smothers Brothers show to Glen Campbell's show and the time I saw him at the Ohio State Fair in the late sixties. He was a gifted musician and performer and wrote intelligent, quirky songs that are unlike anything else out there. This is a great retrospective of his early career and has many of the songs that I remembered, but hadn't heard in decades. ""Housing Project"" was my first purchase of Hartford music and it still stands as one of those imminently listenable experiences all these years later."
4,"Good unit, but high price point","We've been using this unit for a couple of seasons, now.On the upside:* Easy to fill* QUIET as compare to many other humidifiers* Does a great job of getting water into the air* Does a good enough job taking junk out of the air to make you recoil in horror at the debris you have been breathing.* The weekly clean is easy enough - just need to wash the basin with soap and water).On the downside:* The price is high for a humidifier.* You must do a more indepth clean once a month. It is not hard, it is just a pain in the ....All in all, I like this unit.Please do not be detered by the bad smell review. Like all humidifiers, this unit must be cleaned. I left mine too many days, once, and it blew a foul odor into the room. A quick wash down fixed that."
5,Bumble Bee,This is some real stuff to have friends that are still down even though somethings have happend. I'm wailting on the next part to arrive in the mail. Keep doing what you love.
5,A Blue Note Rock CD?,"This apparently out-of-print CD might be the only rock flavored CD on the iconic jazz label Blue Note. Worth tracking down or buying used, this has one of Ulmer's best bands with the hard-hitting Ronald Shannon Jackson on drums, the ubiquitous Bill Laswell on bass and as co-producer, and Nicky Skopelitis on 12 string and banjo(!). Superficially a pop/rock listen, but there's a lot going on under the surface: the spirit of haromolodic interplay buried in the hot licks. Only 35 minutes, but there's not a wasted note on there. Quite different sounding than most of the ""Blues Experience"" outings, but in that vein. Catchy tunes that at first seem a bit trite but stick in your brain long after the 35 minutes are up. An accessible introduction for the Blood newbie, and a different look for the fan."
3,Not the Best,"These magnetic bits work well and seem to be pretty heavy duty. That being said, I've used better magnetic bits in the past. These were expensive and bought out of necessity since Amazon didn't seem to have much of a selection on these items. They are a little long and can sometimes defeat the purpose of using them on the Bosch impact driver since I need to work in some tight spots."
5,High Voltage Gift,This is a great gift for anone neededing a high voltage charge but it can be effectively used in a 6 volt to 12 volt conversion of an older car. I used it in a 12 volt conversion of an older Ford.
5,ONE HOT BOOK!,"Oh yes, Relentless Aaron's book is so hot my fingers are still sizzling from the heat!This author has staked his claim in the urban fiction market!The character Reginald Jackson aka ""Push"" is captivating, cunning and cool.This cat is on a mission to avenge his parents murders and make a name and money for himself in the real estate world. Set in Harlem NY. this story is one of revenge, sex, deceit, money, killers and users. Thoughout the book there is a rash of extremely strong characters some are made clear to us and some are hiding in the background only to jump out from the pages of this book to to surprise us! I especially enjoyed the effect Asondra had on Fred she had this man's tongue hanging out of his mouth, I had a good laugh when these two characters were together. Relentless has left nothing to the Imagination every page is captivating, Intriguing and addictive.I want more... Relentless... where is ""Push 2""? This book is a movie deal waiting to happen?"
1,Want speed dial? FORGET IT!,"This phone does NOT have speed dial. You MUST scroll through its address book to select an entry. Who was the moron who made that design decision? It's like buying a modern car and finding out it doesn't come with anti-lock brakes or cruise control. (And, yes, I called the company just to make sure I hadn't missed speed dial in the manual.)"
5,Fabulous Resource!!!,"We just completed our migration to Exchange 2003, and this book helped us plan the process, gave us a solid outline on how to test the migration process, and walked us through our live production migration. The book also helped us better understand the administration tools in Exchange 2003 along with tips on ongoing maintenance and management practices that we have put in place. This was the best IT book I've ever owned, packed with great information!"
5,Necessary for serious Milton students,"This book compliments the Longman edition of Paradise Lost, and therefore gives one a complete set of Milton's poems. This, along with the other book,is easy to ready because the poetry on each page is relatively short; footnotes serve to split the text and therefore make it easy to read. The book also contains an extensive bibliography of Milton scholarship, and since this book is out of print, Amazon is one of the only companies to offer brand new copies."
5,Pretty good automatic switch...so far,"I installed this automatic bilge pump switch 2 years ago, and so far it has perform flawlessly. It is totally oblivious to gas, oil, fungus, algae, and debris."
1,DUH NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE,"Can't even find it on the Johnson website.What voltage is it? 12, 24, 36 115?How much current does it draw when idle?How much current does it drwaw when on (not counting the pump)?How deep does the water have to be to turn ON.How deep does the water have to be to turn OFF.Does it have a turn on time delay?Does it have a turn off time delay to empty plumbing?"
1,Where You There?,"Process of Elimination is a prime example of how not to write a screenplay.The script is so full of technical errors as to make it unworthy of serious consideration at any level. A professional producer would read no further than page twenty-five before depositing in the nearest round file. Not a piece of work that one should consider for purchanse, in my opinion."
5,A Brilliant Book,"Quite simply, this book itself is brilliant. Written with enthusiasm and passion, and intended to inject an appreciation of beauty into the analysis of chess, this book became the model for most chess writing for the next 50+ years."
2,the immortal battalion,be careful if you buy the american version of this movie. It has significant cuts in content by comparison with the British version. I bought the american DVD to replace my VHS tape and was disappointed.
3,"""Vienna...the jewel of the empire...but it won't hold you know.""","""Death in Vienna"" succeeds on several levels. It presents a portrait of the comfortable life of middle/upper middle class Viennese with their theaters and coffee houses. Readers learn about the development of modern psychological practice (Freud is a minor player in the story) and the barbaric techniques that preceded analysis. Finally, the tale offers a strong foreshadowing of the horrors in store for Vienna and all of Austria in the 1900s. Unfortunately, the book is not such a strong mystery. The reader is faced with a seemingly impossible crime, which concludes with (in my opinion) a wildly improbable solution. It's a bit hard to keep track of everyone; there are oodles of bit characters. And, finally, the short chapters hinder the reader from really getting into the book. Even with these flaws, however, the book is worth reading for the historical portrait of a beautiful, cultured city with a very ominous cloud on the horizon."
4,"Haven't heard the whole record yet, but...","I saw them play a number of the new songs at Bowery Ballroom in New York the other night, and they were terrific--the only drawback was that they didn't play long enough. But Denmark is a lovely song, and Garden Song and My Best Friend were also fantastic. Because these songs are not easily categorizable, I imagine that they will never get played on the radio, which is just a shame--I keep meeting people who've never heard of Ocean Blue, and whenever I play the band for them, they always love the music. Anyway, I'm just immensely relieved that they're still making music. It's been so long since their last record--about five years, I think--that I was starting to wonder if they'd broken up...."
1,not good,gary allan just isn't very good. i was really disapointed with this cd. he even stole a song (Best I Ever Had) from Vertical Horizon and totally ruined it! lousy.
5,Tough All Over,This is one of his best ones yet!!! Absolutely LOVE this album!!!! Gary Allan is a breath of fresh air!
4,"Flashes of pain, brilliance, and power","If you're a Gary Allan fan, you need this album because it will allow a view of to raw human emotion we don't often encounter. If you're new to Gary Allan, I'd suggest trying some of his earlier work - I think it would be wrong to start here and work backward.This CD is great if you want to cry and get close to crushing emotions. It's not a CD to play if you want to be cheered up."
1,Buy the rocklock,"I hate this carabiner, to small to be functional as anything but a gear carrier, can't get anything in or out of the gate without it hanging up negates that purpose. Buy the rocklock- much better design."
1,I guess it only works for same brand Keystone jacks,"My project was Cat6 install for entire new offices for our company. I purchasedCAT6/CAT5E RJ45 White 110 Punch Down Keystone Jackand try to use this mount box for warehouse data ports. However, I could not install with this one. I guess it only works for their own brand keystone jacks. In addition, it looks more yellow beige colored one - NOT like the bright white one you see on the product photo."
5,Fantastic violin music,"I found this CD while looking for violin music for my grand-daughter who's studying violin. I was completely blown away by the varieties included on the CD.It is a wonderful blend of classical,medleys,dances,reels, jazz,Celtic pieces, reels,jazz,and western, all performed by leading artists who provide their talents and interpretations to enhance your enjoyment.Your feet will tap, your ears delighted to 17 selections you will want to play over and over again."
5,Great Grammar Review,"I was deciding whether to take a Spanish course and wondered what I remembered and at what level would I fit in. This is an easy-to-use- format and I had forgotten more than I thought. But, not to give up, the book helps the student get back up to speed on the compound tenses and the fancy tenses."
4,Back on track and more powerful than ever,"I always knew they had it in them ever since I saw 'Don't Be Late' on MTV in its first year. They have kept the power toned down in the past, gave you a glimpse on 'Generation 13', and really let it out on this one. Yes, it's different than their previous work, but that's the definition of a progressive band. It's not enough to unseat my favorite Saga release, but it gets better every time I play it. Give it a try, it will grow on you and the underlying Saga 'style' is there. I can't wait to here the next one. Look out Dream Theatre!"
3,"Getting old, wait, it was old","Getting old and stale. Feels like reading a story in real-time. If it takes you a week to read the book, that's how much time passed in the story too.. (kind of..) anyhow, hopefully since the next book is technically done already, we won't have to wait to finish up the dang series."
5,A Must for All Animal Lovers,"No matter where you stand on the issue of animal rights, this book will give you a better understanding of the animal rights movement, and the case which launched the founding of PETA. It is very well written, describing in great detail the story of the Silver Spring monkey abuse case, in which an NIH-funded researcher, Edward Taub, was convicted of animal abuse for neglecting and abusing his research subjects. It is essential reading for animal lovers and anyone who is interested in animal rights and/or animal welfare. I found it easy to read, educational, and yet, disturbing."
1,"Poor quality video, little introduction","Very poor quality video, very hard to hear, and more to the point, hard to see through the graininess. The video techniques jump between being very childish, to ""what did he just do?""."
1,IQ vs EQ,"Ideally, there should be no adversity between IQ and EQ. But after decades of Kumon in Japan, we can see that it has done very little to curb the country's suicide rate. Anyone who commits suicide has very low EQ. A Time Magazine article (""What's Wrong with Asia's Schools?"") stated that school children in Japan are committing suicide. What use is high IQ if you're brain dead anyway? Japan has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, and its people is one of the unhappiest. Kumon's route method must have contributed a lot to this phenomenon. After all, people with low EQ have been found to be strictly routine and nonspontaneous in their lifestyles."
4,good read for kids and adults alike,"I am not going to say that this book will change your life as an adult, but it'll remind you of a important principles. It, however, may be much more impactful for tweens and teens ... it'll make them question their decisions. I am not one for not eating the marshmellows, at all ... this book will remind us all that at least we at least that there's a decision to be made."
4,Feedback,"No worries here. Product arrived fast and was as advertized.This product was hard to find in retail outlets, so I am very pleased to find it here."
2,Poor workmanship,"Item out of the box did not work. Most importantly, The front deraillur was defective and several of the cheap Jeep decals on the bike were frayed and peeling off. Customer service was through a third party who were less than helpful. Returned the product immediately."
1,AWFUL quality!!!,"I love the chain reference, so I guess I'll need to find one of these made in the 80s/90s to get the quality they used to have.I bought a geniune leather, large print Thompson and after 3 weeks of owning it, the pages are popping out of the 'sewn-in' binding (if you want to call it sewn--it's not, it just appears so)all throughout my Bible--even areas that I haven't spent any time in! My husband bought his yesterday and he's already starting having the problems I had after I bought mine.So, in summary, if you are thinking of buying a Thompson new, save your money, because it was truly a waste of ours!"
5,Exciting new material for the guitar!,"Here is a wonderful new set of pieces to add to the often too-limited repertoire for the classical (read:Spanish) guitar. Mompou was a Catalan composer who wrote not only for guitar, but also for piano. Mr. Fletcher plays these pieces with the proper combination of inner feeling and outer flash. To his further credit, he transcribed most of the pieces here for guitar from their original piano versions in an Atlanta coffeehouse. Raise a cup of Java and listen one of the most exciting classical guitar CD's in years!"
4,Low price high quality film scanner,"The over all quality is good for a product at this price. The iSDR hardware do work with SilverFast but the dust/scratch removal result would be much better with VueScan. But for heavy scratches, it can still be seen on the final result, which can be removed by the clone tool in photo.It's noise is controlled in acceptable range and color adjusted in VueScan is good. I'm pleased with the result."
2,Dissatisfied,"The scratch and dust removal feature worked when I first got the scanner, but began to malfunction after a few weeks into use. I tried to contact Plustek who promises a 24 hour response. I've made three attempts to obtain help, and never heard a word from them. The price would be good for a working device, but its way much money for something that's not functional and a company that won't support their product."
5,Heavy duty,"I searched through the local shops for a heavy duty plant dolly to support a 24"" pot. All of the available plant dollies were junk. As a Florida resident, I need to be able to move plants prior to bad weather. An Internet search led me to this product. To verify the description of the product, I called the vendor. The representative from DeVault Enterprises that I spoke to was knowledgable and courteous. I was assured that the dolly would support the estimated 250 lbs of pot/plant weight. The dolly has been received and in use. It is actually better than I expected. The wheels/casters are definitely heavy duty. I plan to order more dollies."
2,eh ...,"The pacifier isnt the type where you can have them suck on it and be fine, your finger has to be in there the entire time, or their little tongues push it out, so it defeats the purpose of getting it so that you dont have to keep putting it back in their mouth. The stuffed animal is so light, there is no weight to it at all, so it just falls over. if your baby knows how to hold onto things and control them, then this would be ok, but not for a 3/4/5 month old. cute idea though :)"
3,Not a CD that you'll regret buying...,"...but not one that you'll be completely satisfied with. This is a CD that truly is, as another reviewer has noted, made for commercials. Several of them have been used in such a manner, like ""Slayed"" in the Victoria's Secret ad and ""Horndog"" in the Mitsubishi ad (and Mitsubishi, in the process, killed ""Horndog""). Still, the music is pretty good, especially with ""Meteorology"", where the vocals aren't as tacky as they are on other tracks (ex., on ""Slayed"", when the vocalist says something to the effect of ""Grab a handful of plastic / Not the real deal but it feels fantastic""). All in all, its pretty good, but its no epic recording. Perhaps with time, Overseer will become more of a musician than a guy who'll peddle his songs to corporations (though to be fair, that is how I became acquainted with it)."
1,Perfect advertising soundtrack,"This one's a perfect soundtrack for a commercial, which is not a compliment by any stretch of the imagination. Derivative, soulless, and utterly lacking in any distinguishing character of its own. A good disc for playing ""Spot The Influence""-- here's the Massive Attack song, here's the Apollo 440 track, here's the Dirty Vegas rip-off (which is an ironic concept in itself...). Exactly the kind of disc that would appeal to people who make lifestyle choices based on advertising."
1,Very Misleading!,"This color was stated as Hi-Viz, stated Hi-Viz on the order and the shipping box. I had the bike shop install and this color is plain yellow!"
5,Cascadia full fenders,"These fenders fit perfectly wrapped around my 29"" wheels and they work as good as they look. I'm very satisfied and they got here in just a couple of days. I put them on within a few hours of them getting here."
4,Pretty nice fenders!,"Just received these as a present and installed them on my bike. Pretty easy install, I had to go to the hardware store to get some longer bolts, as my fenders are mounted with a Topeak bike rack as well. Adjustment is very simple, it took maybe five minutes to get them installed and adjusted properly. The black fenders look pretty nice on my bike, only gripe is that each mudflap has a big Planet Bike logo on it."
4,THIS IS A GIFT,"Once again, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because this is a gift and I have NO way of knowing if it plays alright or not. It was received on time and the packaging in perfect order. I won't know if it plays alright until my friend opens it and plays it."
1,"True or False: ""The Bible is the Word of God?""","Although the basic priciples of logic are presented in a clear and orderly manner, this otherwise well-written text is marred by its overtly Christian agenda. A large percentage of the statements used as examples within the text are biblically derived. The secular student is not likely to have sufficient familiarity with these biblical references to judge whether a given statement is accurate or inaccurate (something the author seems to take for granted). Additionally, and most importantly, matters of faith are, by definition, beyond reason and logic and are therefore incompatible with the aims of a logic text. How is a secular student to judge the ""truth value"" of a statement such as, ""Jesus healed the blind,"" or ""The Bible is the word of God?"""
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this curriculum for an advanced sixth grader. It is very poorly organized. There is no schedule to follow to complete the text in a set amount of time. There are no helps for teachers who are not well-versed in logic. The DVD's are a presentation of Mr. Nance reading the student text - an expensive yet completely unnecessary purchase unless your student is solely an auditory learner. My student is trudging through it simply to satisfy diploma requirements. He is an excellent writer, organizes his thoughts well, argues well, and excels in public speaking. This logic course did not enhance his education in any way."
3,My Review of Colored People,"The novel""Colore People"" by Henery Louis Gates, Jr lets other people that did not know the time period of segregation and it's times understand just a little bit more from another point of view from someone that actually lived during this time and knew the hard times that had gone on. I think that it was a good story, except for the fact that the way in which he told the story did not make much sense to me. I though that it was kind of harder to followthe entire story at once due to the fact of the way he told the story. Other than that though i thought the novel to be well thought out and very interesting. I learned a few things from this novel that i probably would never have known if I had not read it."
4,Colored People,"The book Colored People, by Henry Louis Gates Jr. taught me a lot about a group of people that I did not know a lot about before I read the book, and may never have known without reading it. I learned about the importance of family and to never be ashamed of them. They are the people most important in your life, and that is something you should carry with you wherever you go. It taught me about overcoming adversity and how important it is to never lose hope. Although it took me a while to start enjoying the book, by the end I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Colored People,"Colored people is a some what interesting book about a man who grew up in West Virginia. This book lags a lot a times as he goes into detail more often than necessary which can be very confusing at times. It is an informative book about his life and he does a good job at explaining what was going on in Piedmont at the time, maybeye a little to much, overall I would not recommend this book to readers it is boring."
3,american history,"Coming from a predominantly ""black"" town, I could feel the pain in Gates's words of how he felt mostly because I see it everyday. Gates did a good job of describing how it was like to live back in the 1950's during the worst times in American history due to what African Americans had to deal with. However there were times when I felt humor in the words that were written, this help me become more interested in what he had to say."
4,Jimmy's Review of Colored People,"The Book ""Colored People"" by Henry Louis Gates Jr. was an interesting book to read about this mans memories. It was very descriptive of the time period and the way it was hard for the colored people of the time to have a say in the community and how they had to work hard for what they had. The story was also very descriptive about his own personal events in his life and how they made him the person he is today. The different characters were shown as the were in real life with their faults and triumphs all descussed. The only thing that made this book a little difficult to read was because the book jumped around a lot from memory to memory. If the book was more organized from the beggining to the end it may have been easier to understand what was going on. All in all I thought this was a pretty good book for someone who is interested in the way a small community delt with the problems of racism in West Virginia."
3,A Little Hard to Follow but Helpful in Many Ways,This book was very hard to follow. Gates skips around a lot and his thoughts seem to ramble together but I also thought this book was very helpful in giving people in West Virginia another look at segregation. I recommend this book to any one who needs to broaden their horizons or that is interested in learning about segregation in West Virginia.
3,"""Colored People""","This book is a memoir by Henry Louis Gates Jr. In this book Gates reflects on his childhood growing up in Piedmont, West Virginia. He describes what it was like for him and his family during the 50s and 60s. I think that this is a great book to help you better understand what segregation was like in West Virginia."
4,"Colored People, an engaging memior.","Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s Colored People is an engaging memior that captures what life was like for African-Americans in the small town of Piedmont, W.V. during the 1950-60s. He shares several of his childhood experiences, while he conveys the hardships fellow ""colored"" members of the community go through during the civil rights movement. It is very easy to find yourself relating to the childhood lessons that Gates shares throughout the book. The only draw back to the book is the confusion you experience while trying to keep all of Gates's family members straight. Over all, Colored People is a brilliant display of what life for small town African-Americans was like during the civil rights movement."
2,"Colored people by Henry Louis Gates, Jr","The book Colored People by Henry Louis Gates, Jr was a memoir about his life as growing up. I really found it hard to get into this book. He would jump around from different times in his life and would tend to jump around from his life an adult and his life a child. It did make me realize how much segregation has changed from when he was a child to when I was a child. And how they really did live a different kind of life. I would recommend this book to people that are interested in learning more on the way colored people grew up and how much it has changed from then to now."
2,Colored People Review,"The book Colored People is a book written by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. It gives readers an intimate feeling and understanding on how life was during a time when Civil Rights was going into effect. It gives a deeper understanding of how African Americans were treated and how they felt about it. Coming from Gates' point of view, being an African American during this time is an interesting way to look at this period in time. It is an account basically of his entire life growing up through this time in history."
3,colored people,"I then that Gates does a good description of what each person that he tells about in the book. When I first started reading the I didn't really under stand it. There was a lot of different people he was bringing it to the story that kind of threw me off track. After bit in to the book it all started to come together and every one took there places. Where the book is based in West Virginia and I am from West Virginia, but all in all it's a pretty good book."
3,Colored People,"Colored People a Memoir by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Is a great book that helps gather insight into the lives of African Americans during the early 1900s. Through Gate's eyes you go on a journey through the everyday life is a ""colored"" town in the small town of Piedmont, WV, and through his many tales you find yourself enthralled in their ways of life. It's a great and easy read."
2,This movie!,I suggest that yall don't buy this movie because it messes up all the time in certain scenes.and the video itself is in poor quality!no matter what seller you get this movie from or what price you get it this movie itself is in poor quality with most of the scenes.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!BUY THE ORIGINAL!NOT THIS MOVIE!THE ORIGINAL IS IN BETTER SHAPE THAN THIS ONE!
1,"Excellent movie, 2nd BAD DVD!!!","I watch a ton of movies throughout the week, so it's not my DVD player. I purchased this dvd around Christmas and it was damaged. Anything beyond Scene 11 has some major interference on screen and the sound is jumpy so the viewer is unable to make out what that the actors are saying. You cannot even pretend to watch it. I sent my copy back and purchased from a different sender and purchased the movie again, but the same problem on a whole new DVD. This is definitely some type of print error on a certain number of these DVD. The movie would be great otherwise, as I watched the mandarin with subtitles. I do n't know what is wrong with the discs."
2,Corny,"This is not a western but some 1920`s rich momma`s-boy story. I had a hard time liking the main character who was a criminal who got away with his crime for no good reason - except for maybe being wealthy. For a wilderness setting, people were showing up everywhere."
3,Orchestral works by Kenneth Fuchs,"I certainly defer to Mr. Morrison, but I find the first two works on this record impossibly dull. 'An American Place' and 'Eventide', while pretty, seem to ramble aimlessly and leave me wholly unsatisfied. Classicstoday.com compares the english horn soloist on 'Eventide' to Kenny G. I would tend to agree with this comparison, although we differ in that their reviewer considers this high praise.'Out Of The Dark' is more interesting, written in a melodic serial style that is rather original. And I certainly can't fault the musicians. Overall, though, this just seems like classical easy-listening."
3,"Someone stop Joe Henry before he ""produces"" again!","I'm serious, someone shove JH out from behind the mixing console before he mangles another CD!!For the record, I own and enjoy most of Joe's CDs and all of Susan's CDs . But the production here is just strange, with lots of instruments in mono panned hard right or left, and almost every track has the trailing sound of some instrument (usually organ) dragging on for too long before the fadeout - gaaa!!But my biggest disappointment with this CD: this a CD by a blues guitarist upon which said guitarist doesn't play! What (TF) were they thinking? Susan: girl, you play fine, don't listen to those pinheads who say you can't. I saw you live last year and was totally blown away by your playing and singing!p.s. Joe H. also helped to ruin the latest CD from Aimee Mann (The Forgotten Arm) with his shenanigans."
3,dorian gray has aged a little bit,"although it sounded good in the store, i only heard the really good parts. some parts are hit while other parts are miss. this comp is pretty good for any electronica/techno collector, but hardly a must."
1,Get his books...,"This ""book"" is just excerpts from Peterson's books. This is not an origional work as I thought. Also, the readings are rather short and not too helpful. I only read a few days before I got tired of reading second-hand material. the other thing that disappointed me was the size...the ""book"" is small and not held together well. In my few days of reading, the pages began to fall out. Save your money and get his other books, you will be better off."
2,I wish there was something more here.,"This is quite possibly one of the worst CDs I've ever bought. I though it would be good because of the Atom and His Package and the Weakerthans stuff, but it really really really is awful."
1,Not a mobile,Only works when plugged in. The battery is simply not good enough. Otherwise the wifi component works really well.
5,Sarah McGreggors' leukemia,"Sarah McGreggors has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant. She also needs it from a compatable donor. Her parents tell her they can't because she's adopted. Sarah decides to find her real mom with a $10,000 One Last Wish check that she got from somebody. She found her mother in L.A., California and her mother says she can't do it because she had cancer and her bone marrow wouldn't help Sarah. At first Sarah's mother didn't want to see her because she had bad memories of before she put Sarah up for adoption at 72 hours old. Sarah and her real mom got together and Sarah's mom apologized for what she did 15 years ago and she was forgiven."
4,Rennee's Mother Help Me Live review,"It was a really good book that I highly enjoyed. Mother Help Me Live gets two meanings throughout the book. I would recommend reading it during the day because it's a very emotional book. The main character is 15 and has lukemia currently after being in remission for 2 years. She needs a bone marrow transplant and that's when she finds out she's adopted. Don't read the following if you don't want to know whether you'll be really happy or sad. Either way you'll bawl so... Okay, just thought it was a really great book and wanted to write about it.Sarah doesn't die."
4,Nice,"I use this to record phone conversation's at work. This is a really nice setup. It does go through battery life kind of fast, but other than that this was worth the money."
2,Lasted about 2 weeks,"Purchased a ""Dictaphone"" to be used for dictation! DUH!It lasted about 2 weeks! Worked well while it worked!They are definitely not made like they used to be!"
3,Turtledove Redux,"This, the latest contribution to the ""Settling Accounts Series,"" is a predictable, formulaic presentation in the, by now, recognizable Harry Turtledove style. Enjoyable, but the book is easily viewed as a frottage. It would be exciting for Turtledove to do a little extemporaneous writing and suprise his faithful readers."
3,Good but not Great...3 and a half Stars,"I went to Best Buy lookin at cd's and this one caught my eye only because I thought this was the same Ill Bill from the dope ass song 'Simian Drugs.' I don't even know now if they are one and the same, but this album didn't have the 'Simian Drugs' feel to it I was looking for. 'Chasing the Dragon' is kinda fresh and 'Anatomy of a School Shootin' is dope lyrically, but beat wise the best song was 'Alien Workshop'. The rest of the CD feels like filler material, kinda old n stale rather than fresh.....2 starsOK it's been 7 years (2011 now) since I posted my impressions about this record above, and I've changed my mind. This album has grown on me somewhat since I posted this review. Ill Bill is a dope lyricist and the beats aren't that bad, just not that great in my opinion, but I have raised my opinion from 2 stars to 3 and a half."
2,Xmas for x? Seriously?,"First off, this is the simplest book to read. I read through it once with my daughter who is 2, it kinda kept her attention. They are just pictures with 3 words underneath...the first and last word begin with the letter in question. Too simple. Art was OK. It needs to be updated or revamped. For instance... Indian with ice cream...wow, throw you back to the 50's. Then there is x for Xmas...as Jews my little girl has no idea who Santa clause is nor Christmas. HIGHLY offensive. Is there a way to get the money back since we will never read this again?"
1,Truform 20-30 Thigh High hose,I sent the hose back before opening the item. Purchased elsewhere before item was shipped therefore I cannot rate as to the quality.
1,LET'S SEE---WHAT'S GOOD TO SAY??,"The book is set in MONTANA. That is it---the only good!!The writing in this----the writing in this----the writingin this---(this is an example of the author's writingstyle--keep repeating the same words)is horrible. The""""sex"""" parts of this book are graphic and in bad taste.The people in this book were---???----all on drugs???---and i wanted to shoot all-all-all of them!! I did finishthe book---I was hoping!!---but---it was a complete wasteof time. This is the kind of book that really shows thedifference in the rating system here at AMAZON."
2,Nine Below Zero,"A very disappointing book. I read the first chapter of Nine Below Zero in the bookstore and couldn't wait to get it home to finish it. While I don't mind reading a dark novel, it would certainly help if I liked the characters, and I did not like one in this novel. Justine in particular grated on my nerves. She is extremely selfish and immature and her self degradation grew weary. I just didn't care. Marvin turned out to be the biggest disappointment. In the first chapter he is funny and insightful. By the end of the novel he is just pathetic."
2,wrong item,"I ordered the satin waist clincher, and received the lace one instead. It does a good job of pulling the waist in to give an hourglass shape, but it doesn't do anything to help control the ""pouch"" I've gotten since giving birth. Also, the garter belt attachments seem to roll up and look weird, and this garment is not invisible as it claims, You can clearly see where the clasps fasten under shirts that are even the slightest bit form fitting. Another note, some reviews said this product runs small, but I didn't think so. I ordered a medium and it fit well, although I needed to have my husband help fasten it at first. After a few minutes of wearing I noticed it getting a bit looser. I'll be returning this, and going with another brand."
1,"Very False Rating... Teen for ""Realistic Blood and Violence???","Just so you know, this game doesn't mention language on the back. It does, however, contain it. Lots of it. Please don't buy this game. Why play games with so much profanity when there are so many good, clean games to choose from?"
3,scent is weaker than expected,I've been using Paco for years (25+). The strength of the scent seems weaker the last few bottles purchased than what I've been used to. Not sure if I will continue using the cologne if the scent is not there.
4,"Nice, but does not look like the picture","The watch is very nice, but much smaller than it seems in the picture, and the band is not brown at all- it's beige. Still, a very stylish watch, I'm keeping it."
4,Haiku for the rest of us,"Sometimes, traditional haiku bores me. Mentions of the season, nature, etc.However, this book lends lighthearted humor to the poetry style.Enjoyed it then passed it along to a friend."
4,Good product. And for your information.,"This product works as advertised. Sufficiently quiet (quieter than the laptop itself ), but I'm not sure if I can give 5 stars, because I haven't tested other models so can't compare.I'd like to point out one interesting point of this product:If you need just USB 1.x, you only have to plug one USB port. Connect the 'USB IN' port (instead of the 'POWER' port) to the computer USB. That way, the 4 USB ports and the 2 fans all work fine, with only one USB cord between the lapcool4 and the laptop. You don't have to feed the 'POWER' port. So this thing works very fine as a 'docking station', with all my USB devices plugged to the back of the lapcool4. With ONLY ONE USB cord to the computer.But I heard that if you need USB 2.0, it actually needs more power, so this setup won't work. The same is true if you need the card reader. And if your computer doesn't have USB 2.0, this thing will never work as USB 2.0."
1,Did not work in Istanbul,This adapter plug looks different then the picture. It didn't fit inside the recessed outlets in my hotel in Istanbul. I ended up having to share with my roomate and use her adapter.
1,low quality product,This product is low quality and can't use it. It looked everything is loose in this adaptor. I couldn't return it because i bought it with Grounded adaptor which is alright. This one is bad.
2,flimsy stuff,"i bought 3 of these since they were cheap, and it's a good thing i did since they're also cheaply made. one of them broke on the first day of my week long trip and another one broke before the week was over. the price should have been an indicator of the workmanship but i'm a sucker for a bargain I guess :-)"
2,skip this and read the Rabbit books,"This novel has some interesting points, however I sense that Mr. Updike did not spend much time on it.The Rabbit novels are excellent. However, ""The Coup"" seemed like a practice draft for this otherwise accomplished author.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
1,Disappointing...,"I read a wide variety of books, but this was very amateurish. No real character development. I'm about half way through and contemplating not finishing it. Urban fiction, when done right, can be very good. Read something by Leo Sullivan or Tracy Brown to understand what I'm saying. They have skills!"
5,Great read!,"After reading ""A Gangster's Girl"", I couldn't wait to read, ""Married to the Game"". I finished this book in one day. It's definitely a page turner. This book made me want to cry and cuss, lol! There are some parts in this book that will definitely make you cry. Duke was my favorite character. He was just off the hook. I didn't like the ending, but the book was hot!"
4,This book was good,This book was off the hook I mean I could not put it down. I didnt read the first book but I bet it was good too. I mean I loved every thing up until the end thats the only thing that disappointed me.
4,Fascinating Man/Amazing Ideas,"Culbertson was a house-hold name in the 1930's as a great bridge player. He made millions promoting himself and bridge. The he tossed it all away since it was trivial and he wanted to develop a plan for world peace.the book written in 1943 is interesting in its perspective for history buffs. he gives a complete plan and a constituion for the World Peace Federation. Think if maybe it was better than the United Nations.The part of treatingthe Middle East seems very interesting.Great price for this classic book.See his autobiography ""The Strange Lives of One Man"". A great adventure story."
5,pretty,"this ring is really pretty, if you dont like something sticking out i would not recommend it because it does stick up a fairly decvent amount. but it is beautiful!"
3,Alphabet Girl,Not my favrite episode but it was Good. hard to pick a favrite hav'nt seen whole series yet. plus I have afew right now. But I'm getting off topic back to the episode at hand. It seemed they skiped around the alphabet a bit. Though it was still a dicent episode. I hawe clue who this girl is yet but she has a banging body. I'm an ass man. And I'd put hers right up there with Jacqueline Lovell's and belive me thats saying something. If your wathing this series for the first time. When you make it to an episode with Jacqueline in it and she shows her ass watch this this one again and you may fill the same way I do. even if you don't you won't be able to deny this girl has a vary nice ass.
4,Good for the basics,Good instruction in terms of basic tile installation. Nothing too fancy but that's the nature of Dean Johnson. Good fundamental instruction is what this provides. If you're doing something complicated you may need to supplement this DVD with some additional material.
4,,"I was happy to find this challenging, genuine prenatal yoga video. This is a demanding workout, one I would not recommend for a yoga novice. However, it does not totally satisfy me, and there are some real drawbacks. Pros: an actual modified sun salutation (both series A&B)!, hip openers such as king pigeon, and standard yoga poses such as trikonasana, and virabhadrasana 1 & 2. Cons: I had rug burns on my knees the first time I did this routine, until I realized I needed padding under them. It is long and repetitive, the choreography is awkward and excessive at times, and the instruction is okay for experienced yoginis but not ideal."
5,Great prenatal yoga - respects pregnant women!,"I used this video when I was pregnant the first time and am just starting to rely on it again. I found so many prenatal yoga videos to be just about breathing and stretching, they were dull and didn't feel like they were appropriate until about the last month. This video assumes that pregnant women are strong and vital, and helps not only maintain but build strength so you can enter childbirth and motherhood physically ready for it all."
3,for experienced vinyasa yogis only,"I was recommended this video from a friend who knows Jennifer Wolfe, because I had taken on a prenatal yoga class and was grasping for help because I was oriented toward difficult yoga and my ladies wanted to move and to relax and they were not yogis. It was way too hard for them (I never used it) I had to laugh when I saw the modified chatturanga. BUt I think if someone is already fit and their bodies are used to vinyasa this is a great resource for them."
2,Only for those very fit and practiced,"I have done quite a bit of yoga, and I am of average fitness. I found this practice far too fast and very physically challenging, some poses were deemed unsafe for pregnancy, when reviewed by my yoga teacher... I would say that the full workout is only suitable for well practiced and very fit individuals. The short ones are doable."
3,So-so,I don't prefer the music but the standing poses and squats make it an ok workout. The floor exercises are very short and I stop it here and hold the poses longer. I've tried the 45 min section 3 times and probably won't do it again.
2,Only for Experienced Yoginis,"I'm a Prenatal Yoga instructor and mother of three, and I was very excited to get this DVD. However, I was disappointed.I feel it is much too vigourous for the average pregnant person. It is definately not for those without yoga experience. I feel many of the movements have the possibility of straining the abdominal and back muscles.Please purchase with caution, and only if you have previous yoga experience with Vinyasa or Power Yoga.In addition, the production quality isn't the best.I found the most useful part of the DVD to be the section on partner yoga.I much prefer The Divine Mother Prental Yoga Series by Anna Getty. Or Prenatal Yoga with Gurmukh.Happy Pregnancy."
3,pretty good,"it's a good dvd. i really like the fact that it has a 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 minute workout options based on your comfort level and how much time you actually have. i have noticed that it relieves my back pain a lot. i've done yoga before getting pregnant so i was familiar with the moves/poses, but it may be a little difficult for someone who has never done yoga before. also, i was a little disappointed in the couple's segment - i expected it to be like the regular workout options, something that we would flow and be able to follow nicely, but it just gives examples of poses."
5,Great throughout pregnancy,"I had Jennifer Wolfe's longer prenatal yoga version for my previous pregnancy and didn't use it often, because an hour+ was just too much most days, even for someone who has been doing yoga for years. The short forms is perfect, because I can tailor it to my energy level and time on hand (sometimes in short supply when pregnant and parenting a 2 year old). I am days away from my due date for my second child and still doing the 15-minute option, which is enough to loosen me up and ease the pains of pregnancy without overdoing it. The 45-minute session is challenging enough to feel like a workout without overdoing it throughout most of pregnancy, and the 30-minute session is a nice, moderate workout. The production value and music aren't fancy, but the poses are great, and the option to choose what fits your energy that day is fantastic."
4,Good Workout,"This is a great dvd for those already participating in yoga prior to pregnancy. The insructor moves through the positions fairly quickly and it makes for a good workout. There are a lot of moves on your knees, which can be a bit uncomfortable, but I still really enjoy the dvd."
4,Subtle Tony,"This is a very sophisticated jazz set. Tony is more subtle and less driving than one might expect, however. Unfortunately, no drum solos (which would have earned five stars). But Tony is Tony and well worth seeing in any venue. The video and sound quality are excellent.Carpe Noctum"
1,"An anti-semitic exercise in logical gymnastics,","in which a Catholic apologist seeks to justify atrocities like the persecution of the Conversos and the execution of religious dissidents. This book is truly repulsive, made even worse by 21st century reviewers who are willing to lap up this moral garbage and cite it as ""the truth."" An example of Mr. Walsh's arguments:""Finally, let us be realistic about the matter - there is a quality in the Jews which does not exist in any other race...is it not possible, is it not indeed obvious, that the elusive difference is spiritual?...how could such a people, cast off once more by a just God whose divine Majesty they had affronted, fail to experience an inner dislocation of the spirit, which, as the core and animating principle of their whole being, must inevitably extend disharmony, discontent, and futility to their outward acts, bodily and mental?"""
2,Uneven; not good,"I wanted to like this book because Ray Flynn is a fellow Catholic and a fellow Bostonian, and the basic idea of a pope being elected who is a widower with children has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, there are too many problems. The writing is very uneven; in places it isn't bad, but much of the dialogue is wooden and awkward. The theology is startlingly bad, especially in a work purportedly by a former ambassador to the Vatican. Or perhaps it was very badly edited. In any case I stopped reading altogether when I reached the point two thirds of the way through where the Eucharist was casually said to be symbolically the Body of the Lord (not REALLY!). That, of course, is the Protestant position; it has no place in a book that's supposed to be about Catholics."
1,ugh...why?,ok I'm sorry but this cd is really bad. They cant sing and they dress way to old for their age. Plus they needed Chris Trousdale to make them sound better which didn't work to well. lol. I wouldn't waste my money on this cd.
1,Disturbing,"There's something very disturbing about seeing a girl who looks like she could pass for about 8 (from left to right, she's the third girl on the album cover) dressing like that. Sorry. I've heard some of their music, and it's fair, but the blatantly overexposed sexuality of these young girls is rather disgusting."
4,been using it for a long time,"I have been using Alessi for quite a few years and really like it's strong, but mellow taste. I buy it at Amazon because it's less expensive than in the stores."
4,Alessi Espresso,Have used this product for more than a year and would highly recommend to espresso lovers. Makes full bodied authentic Italian Espresso without a bitter aftertaste.
2,"Starts out well, but ...","I was enjoying the book with its description of the police department and its cast of characters, and a mystery that was set up nicely. But as the novel went on, it lost steam, and the ending was rushed and confusing. It left me scratching my head, trying to figure out exactly what happened to the killer. Halfway through, I was looking forward to reading more in the series, but by the end, I was disillusioned and giving up on the Charlie Resnick series."
3,Only runs for a little while!,"Looks great with the comforter set and my daughter loves it. The only problem (and a major one at that) is the motor only spins the mobile for a few short minutes. It would be nice if the music and mobile spun long enough for my daughter to fall asleep. Otherwise, she's only entertained as long as I stand there and keep winding it up."
2,Replying is not the same thing as *refuting*,"Walter Cassels' classic of Victorian rationalism, ""Supernatural Religion"", created a sensation in the late 19th century theological world. First published in 1874, it ran through many editions until the author's death in 1907. Despite a popular belief that Bishop J.B. Lightfoot soundly refuted Cassels' scholarship, the Bishop's essays were in fact dismissed as inadequate by contemporary theologians such as Otto Pfleiderer and Samuel Davidson. As Cassels noted in his own ""Reply To Dr Lightfoot's Essays"", the Bishop devoted most of his argument to minor side-issues regarding footnotes and patristic references while failing to discuss important questions such as the credibility of the New Testament record of miracles and the Resurrection. The latter word, incidentally, doesn't even appear in the index of Lightfoot's book! Two stars for scholarly merit, but this doesn't deserve its exaggerated reputation as the final word on the debate."
4,Pretty Darned Good,"The Wedding Present it's not, but David Gedge's latest effort is not bad. Actually it's better than his previous Cinerama efforts. I categorize it as cheezy aged britpop. They are coming to San Francisco in 2 weeks, and I am going to see them on the strength of this album."
5,The worst song of the album,"I give this track full marks simply because I'm refering to Catatonia. There are songs MUCH MUCH better than this one! I'm the first person to review it, do you wonder why?"
3,an ok read,"Well I liked this book well enough. It is a time-travel fantasy book. The hero is Dar a Norse God who is tricked by Loki and travels forward in time and to another planet, earth, where he meets the heroine, Jennifer. She is having a really rotten year. Her mother has past away, the bills are piling up and to top it off she was just layed off. Then out of nowhere Dar appears and she almost hits him with her jeep. He thinks her jeep is a beast and is ready to defend himself from it. He ends up staying with her as her boarder and in the process proceeds to tear up several of the homes furnishings. Also he has this pet dragon who is very picky about what he eats chewing up her shoes and other belongings. Not to mention a few squirrels. There is quite a bit of humor in this book as they adjust to each other. they also must fight evil from both worlds. This is a nice book for an afternoon read."
4,"Margaret, Australia","I usually don't even bother with time swept books, but this was one of the exceptions. I can honestly say that I thoroughtly loved this book. I would love to have my very own baby dragon, even if it ate my furniture, my shoes and made snacks on the neighbors pets. Now Dar the norse god who popped into to Jennifer's life, what can I say , he can pop into my life any time he wants to. If you enjoy a book that can make you laugh, this is the book for you"
3,MISSING ALOT,"THIS WAS OK... BUT WAS MISSING A TON. WHERE IS ""YOU CANT KILL ROCK N ROLL"" OR ""FLY HIGH AGAIN"". THIS DIDNT EVEN HAVE ""PERRY MASON"".BUT, THEY PUT WORSE SONGS LIKE CRAZY BABIES AND GOODBYE ROMANCE, WICH I DONT LIKE VERY MUCH. AND WHY WAS THE RECORDING OF WAR PIGS AND BLACK SABBATH SO CRAPY. I DOWNLOADED MUCH BETTER QUALITY WARPIGS OF WINMX. BUT, THIS DID INCLUDE SOME VERY GOOD SONGS LIKE NO MORE TEARS(THOUGH THE UNCUT VERSION IS MUCH BETTER) AND OF COURSE, CRAZY TRAIN. ITS JUST A GOOD CD. NOT GREAT, BUT NOT BAD.I SEE THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO WROTE REVIEWS AGREE WITH ME. I GUESS I COULD GIVE IT 3 1/2 FOR THE SENSE TO PUT IN BARK AT THE MOON AND OVER THE MOUNTAIN."
2,Too much violence,"While one generally notes and accepts a certain level of violence in historical romance, this book was beyond the pale in terms of the physical and psychological abuse heaped on the ""heroine"" by the supposed ""hero."" I spent most of the book feeling disgusted with the hero instead of liking him and found that any admiration for the strong heroine was utterly dissipated by her utter weakness in falling for a guy who abused her. Place these characters in modern times and the heroine would be in a shelter for battered women and the hero in jail - hopefully."
4,powerful book,"I think a lot of new romance readers are coming to the genre. Perhaps they are less familiar with the period and reality of the era and want their heroes and heroines to act like today, just wear kilts or armor. I appreciate the strength of this book. Not everyone is likable and perfect. Books would get boring if they were. I love complex characters and Johnson delivers in spades on this. A dark tale, but well worth the time."
5,Rev Up Your Metabolism,"This incredible CD is highly inspirational, and positive. I find that it helps me start my day focused and energized. Thank you Sheri for creating such a nurturing, supportive CD in my journey for a positive body image."
1,They sent me the wrong thing!,"I've used this before. It works well. Only problem is they sent me the wrong thing. I ended up getting some edible powder thing. Wayyyyy off! Too embarrassing to send back and deal with it, but I wouldn't order it again."
3,Disspassionate Witness Deflates Emotional Impact of Infidelity,"Read this because I enjoyed The Finkler Question so much. However, it disappoints. Wordy occassionally drily humorous commentary promises a close and amusing look at two contemporary British marriages. It never seems to take flight as characters remain one-dimensional (wives Hazel and Chas for example) , or cyphers ( Charlie and Nyman) whose sexual modus operandii substitute for personality.Kreitman, the protagonist, remains trapped by his conflicted view of women, his desires, and his reputation, galvanized to inaction, unable to connect fully with either the people he cares about, or his moral precepts. Jacobson`s narrator observes and reports and often analyzes, but never really invites the reader to explore as the tale unfolds. We remain as disengaged as the group in the novel. As a porrtrait of contemporary marriage and sexuality it`s a bleak picture."
1,Piece of Junk,"Planned obsolescence? Individual lights began giving out, until only about half of them worked. Then the alarm/time became unresponsive to input which renders the thing good for an awkward paperweight. I can only hope the design quality has improved. It couldn't have been worse for mine."
3,TOO MANY CHARACTERS!,"This book started off really good and promising, but after I got to like 100 and the author was STILL introducing characters..I tossed it aside. It's hard to focus on a story when the author has created like ten or eleven main characters. This story was very hard to follow after about three chapters because each chapter a new character was created. This one really deserves two stars, but I gave it an extra star for the beginning because it was really good."
2,Not impressed...,"I have owned many different book lights. I purchased this one because I thought the push button was neat, and it seemed travel friendly. Those are it's only features, though. It is not very adjustable, at all. I usually have to hold it in my hand to get the light into a position to be able to read anything, which kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? It's also not terribly bright. To top it off, I was using it last night and went to pull the metal clip forward so I could slide the pages into it without tearing them (it's not easy to slide on one handed) and sliced my finger wide open! I've had smaller cuts from carving knives! Now I have a bloody book, a crappy booklight and a sore finger. Not a bargain!"
4,"""Sult"" beskriver Oslo godt, men ikke helt!","In 1985, after starting to learn Norwegian and while preparing to live for a semester near Oslo, I asked a good friend what I should read (beyond Snorre, the sagas, folk tales, Peer Gynt, etc) to get a better feel for Norway. She recommended Sult (Hunger), Skipper Worse, and something else. Having spent many moons walking around in Oslo since that time, I can report that Sult describes very well the feeling of isolation that one can easily experience there, a Munchian existence that goes well with ""Skreiken"". That's only one side of the story, however. Sult does not describe the friendship offered by Norwegian people once one comes into a circle of friends! Still: required reading for anyone who wants to 'understand' Norway."
2,Must have been better in context,"After having read great reviews, I read Hamsun's Hunger.I must say I was dissappointed. The plot was repetitive and annoying. The character wasn't built deep enough for me to sympathize with him.It has to be different reading this book in the context of 19th century Norway, but I was unable to do so - mostly because of my ignorance of Scandinavia, partly because I wasn't captivated by the book.The novel's success was in making me feel down and out like the narrator. Reading this was painful..."
1,Buyer Beware,"A butchering, if I may say so, of an outstanding work. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Sverre Lyngstad translation published by Penguin!!!"
1,?,"But how can you call it two performances of the same piece when they both sound completely different, and what's the point of having 20 minutes of woofer-destroying bass rumble that's obviously going to hurt your ears at any level over 22 decibels!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
5,Different than the others,"Though at first, I thought SDC was nothing more than a Stomp wannabe group, I was soon hooked on their rhythm and beat. True that they have many similarities to Stomp, Blue Man Group, and others like it, but it still has its own unique style that combines the beating of trash cans with a bit of hip hop and occasional rap.Anyone who would put down this group obviously has no taste for this type of music and doesn't understand that there can be more than one group that fits into a given genre. Perhaps these same people would complain that Garth Brooks is more of the same country, or that Nelly is just more rap.Bottom line, if you're into the semi-repetitive no melody type of music, then you should definitly look into this."
5,An excellent guide to the National Parks of the USA,"This book has a section on each National Park which describes how to get there, the best times to go, and what to do when you arrive. It includes color pictures and maps of each park. The maps show all the park's visitor centers, main roads, trails and campgrounds. It gives suggestions on what to do if you can spend a half day or full day, etc. It also includes information on facilities for the disabled. Nearby motels and campgrounds are also listed together with the address and phone number of each park's headquarters. I take this book with me to each park we visit and stamp the front page of book with the offical park stamp found in each visitor's center. I've been to 24 of the parks so far and hope to someday visit all of them. This book has been a valuable guide for me"
1,This does not work correctly,I don't understand how children can have hours of fun with this toy. First we purchased the Hide and Seek Monkey. The LED lights would not go off until we were practically on top of the toy. I thought it was the specific one we received so I tried again. This time we purchased the Tiger. Same thing happened. The lights would not go on until you were 5 feet away. My son is 4 and has a great attention span but was bored to tears. I couldn't hide the Tiger under a pillow because it would block the signal. We couldn't hide it in cabinets. It just didn't work.
2,Very hard for kids to use,"I thought this game would be great for the winter while we were stuck inside. The items arrived and the batteries in them were dead. I will hide the tiger and the wands are suppossed to do one light if it is in the room. Everything makes it have one light. My kids pretty much have to be touching the tiger for it to go off. It's a great idea but needs improvements before it's actually ready for kids. I only gave it 2 stays because my kids do like carrying around the wand, otherwise I would have given it one."
4,Great idea!!!,My son loves hide and seek so this toy is perfect! We ordered 2 extra sticks so more friends could play!! Great idea!!
5,It works,It's a cable. It works. The price is excellent. I like it because it's more flexible and more attractive than the standard black coaxial.
2,So Bad Quality,"This shoes were damaged a few dayas after I purshased them. After a rain, my socks were stained with the yellow color from the Reebook's logo."
5,Couldn't have made it w/out this book!,"We have read this book literally hundreds of times. I inscribed a note in the front from our deceased dog to the kids, telling them this book was meant to help them. There is a picture in the book with other dogs (up in heaven!) and we named all of them b/c they reminded us of other past/passed beloved pets. The little white dog symbolizes our guinea pig. Anyway, it's great for the kids and a wonderful opportunity to open dialog about bigger life and death issues. I've recommended it to many friends - with children and without!"
1,Ho Hum!,I found this book to be quite boring. Not only were some of the facts incorrect-but many interesting facts were omitted altogether. I don't believe the author even tried to understand the person about whom she was writing
3,a good read,"For somebody like me who didn't know much about the historical context of Marie Antoinette, this book was a good help to understand basic biographical and historical facts. It was an easy read with good information."
5,Kids and Books,I bought this book for two young relatives. The story and the illustrations are great.The girls loved the book and want their own wagon for book hauling.
5,Fabulous for voracious young readers!,"My 4 year old daughter loves books. That is actually an understatement - she is crazy-go-nuts for books. Would rather have a new book than a new doll any day of the week. So when we received this book as a gift for her, AND it was a book about someone who loved books like her....well, her dream had come true. This book is a lovely, non-fiction, rhyming story about a little girl who grew up to open a free public library of her own (her house!) It's not too long, not too short, nice illustrations, fine for 3-7 year olds too, and fun to read. Best of all, it satisfies any aspiring young librarian's appetite. Love this book,"
3,Too Much Reading,"Elizabeth Brown reads books. That's the only thing she did. As a result, she didn't want to do anything else that kids do such as play or go out on a date. Moreover, she collected so many books that she had a library. So, she donated them to the town so that other people could enjoy the books she read. I didn't like the fact that Elizabeth only read books and did nothing else. I just don't think that's a good model for kids."
3,Great but runs small,I will be returning but order 1 size up especially if you have a butty. I will be shopping here again and buying pants are always a guess.
4,Pants,Love the material. I however do not like that they have no front pockets. Dropped my phone out of back pocket and it broke.
2,Only fun for very little kids,"This game I found to be extremley boring. The graphics were horrible, it was extremely repetitive, and the only thing that changes throughout the game play is they add more recipies. It is extremely putsy and pointless. I do think this game would be very fun however for little kids because it would be simple enough for them and when girls are little they tend to like to do things like that."
3,Frankly kind of annoying...,"I love simulation games, especially those that involve cooking. When I received this game, I found it difficult to complete some of the tasks, even in training mode. Then, it seems like with this game more then ever, I will be completing the task, but the Wii doesn't sense it. It's really frustrating. There are quite a few recipies and the challenges are fun, but hard. This games says for everyone, but kids definitly would be frustrated with this game."
3,Cooking...Doesn't Quite Make It To Mama,"When I first got this game for my birthday, I thought ""Oh, cool! Everyone's got this game!"" Well, it turns out everyone is just me.This game is pretty fun at first, but gets repeative. I have to admit, it's fun to see all the recipies from different countries, but there's no point to any of it!!!I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, unless they have a little kid trying to be like his/her mom, and like to cook.Overall, this game can get vey boring, but if you really want this game, I recommend TWO things:1. Get the DS version instead2. Prepare yourself for a short-term gameI would say this game isn't one of my favorites, but it's not so bad that I would trade it in."
4,Fun game!,"I purchased this game ""used-like new"". It definitely was ""like new"" just as described. There is close to no scratches on the disc, and it had the original manual. This was a great purchase for a great price!"
2,Not so hot...,"You'll have to pardon the pun of a title, but honestly, this game did not meet my expectations. I own ""Cooking Mama,"" and ""Cooking Mama 2: Dinner With Friends"" for the DS, and I enjoy them very much. The DS versions are addictive little games that, as a woman who believes my place to be very much outside of the kitchen, I am a little ashamed to admit I like so well. But, well, I do. So when I finally scored a Wii for Christmas this year (thanks, Dad!), I was super excited to try out ""Cooking Mama"" for it. And I just didn't love it. In fact, I really didn't even like it. I just feel like the delicate art of cooking requires the steadier hand using a stylus, not a Wiimote - it's a bit too jerky for what needs to be accomplished with this game."
3,Mediocre title,Daughter loves NDSL game. She bought this with her own money for the Wii and played a couple of days before putting it on a shelf.
4,Lush and different,"I bought this book because I heard them review it on NPR. It was not a disappointment. The drawings do have a Sendak feel to them, but they are freer and looser than the tight ink drawings in Where the Wild Things Are. The story has a different twist to it. One thing I love about it is that instead of the princess being focused on getting a man, this princess yearns for freedom and a chance to play. That's a nice change of pace from all the Cinderellas and Sleeping Beautys and I think teaches a better lesson. This is my second copy, because my niece discovered this one day while playing here and fell in love with it immediately."
4,Inspirational...,"Excellent photography and just enough details about each of the artists and what their creative spaces mean to them. This book is for anyone who wants a ""peek"" into the lives of the amazing women highlighted in the book. Plus, it's fun to compare yourself and your creative space (if you're lucky enough to have one) to these famous creative souls."
3,Inspiring,"For those of us who live and work in our creative spaces, this book is a great inspiration. It really helped me dream bigger about my work space, and gave me some great ideas on how to organize for beauty as well as funtion.If you love vintage details (and even not) this book presents wonderful references for organizing and creating a workspace that is personal and inviting. Some of the artists studio spaces really push the idea of craft storage... Also the women featured in the book, who have used their art to make a business for themselves, can be empowering. Great photos, a good deocorating resource book for the price."
3,Where Women Create,"This is an agreeable book, but I found Organizing Your Craft Space by the same author much better and more useful. Much material is duplicated - you really don't need both books."
1,One to Five Stars ??,"Everything here depends on what you are buying. If this one of numerous reprints of the complete original edition in English running to seventeen hundred odd pages, I well expect that you can you can justify buying it. A current reprint edition is on sale for $1075.00. I have the 1908 complete edition. However, expect to put up with an arcahic 19th Century translation that is not inspired and sometimes plain wrong headed. The abridgement by John H. Collins published in the 1950's makes the most sense for all but very serious students of the Roman Republic or the philosophy of history. Make sure of what you are getting here before buying."
3,Cute Book for Young Pirate Fans,"I bought this book as reading material for fourth grader in my extended family. He likes pirates and so it was appropriate. It is not a quality piece of literature; just a marketing ploy by Dinsey. Yet, it is a cute, predictable and humourous account of a young Jack Sparrow. It is slightly vague in its discriptions because it is dependent on the reader having seen the pirate movie trilogy. Also, it simply is an introduction to the characters in the movie. It's about adventures, not Jack's history, which I thought it might be. Beware: there is usage of pirate dialect and Spanish words which may be difficult for little readers to decipher."
2,Miniature edition...for hobbits? (Micro edition is more like it),"Don't get me wrong. I LOVED this book as a child, so I couldn't wait to get a copy for my kid. I was in such a hurry that I didn't realize what this publisher (or Amazon) calls MINIATURE EDITION must actually mean miniature edition for hobbits. The text in this book is so small, that I'm afraid it will hurt my child's eyes. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I hate this edition of the book because it's ridiculously small. I mean, it's that revolting.You might not mind this size, but I heavily recommend checking it out before you purchase. There a much better sizes at Target that actually look like a miniature size for humans, as opposed to this pocket sized edition. This book does not include how the very hungry caterpillar ate a small hole in my wallet either, go figure."
3,"Very good book, very colorful",This is a very colorful book however I didn't realize we were getting the mini version of the story. The words are small butthe children still enjoy the book. I prefer the full size version.
4,Good book for young toddlers,"It's a very creative book for young toddlers and I enjoy watching my son imitate the caterpillar in the book to crawl on floor and he repeats ""crawl, crawl, crawl""! That's so cute and funny! He learned the word ""butterfly"" and lots of different type of food from this book."
3,cute book but much smaller than expected,"I ordered this book as well as the Brown Bear one for my nephew I had it sent to my address so I could sign it to him and then send it to them. The reason I picked this book is that I remember vividly have my 1st grade teacher reading this book to the class, and how much I loved it. When I received it the books were muuuuuuuuchhh smaller than expected and it just didn't bring about the same feeling of excitedness to send to my nephew. The book is as big as 2 hands side by side."
5,Memories!,"The school that jump started my education loved theatre. As a matter of fact, all grades throughout the year would create a series of short plays so as to have a different grade performing every monday.When I was around 4yrs old, my first time in school, I also experienced my first on-stage experience. My role was to be the one of a pear...who had been eaten by a worm. A very hungry worm at that.I am now a theatre director, and I must say it was thanks to this little book with a great apetite that I have gone as far as I am!decades after reading this book, it still brings joy to me; I would recomend it to any child."
2,Not worth the price,it's a great hard cover book but this cloth book is just not worth the price. It's pretty and it's cute. But it's small and not that exciting. I have found much cheaper and better cloth books... Disappointed.
3,LOVE THE BOOK - but not the size/shape,"We love this story, but this board book is very awkward. It is extremely hard for little hands to hold and turn the pages. Great story, but maybe get the paperback version instead."
5,The very hungry caterpillar,This book is about a caterpillar that hatches out of an egg one sunday morning. It eats through alot of food until it finally settles down and makes a cacoon.I think this is a good book it has good illustrations and it teaches kids about caterpillars and butterflys. I think the age rating for this book is 3-9 because it has a good amount of words and is probably the most widely known childrens book.
5,Chrysalis NOT Cocoon,"This is a classic! I loved this book as a child and love it. I still read it today to my children, and they love it as well. However, I do correct 1 word: cocoon should be chrysalis...or butterfly should be moth. I know neither have sweet ring to them, but children AND school teachers are learning the wrong word. During the pupa stage, a caterpillar is encased in a chrysalis and a moth is encased in a cocoon."
2,"Terrible Children's Book, One of the Worst","It's a shame that this otherwise good book is ruined by a single error that the author stubbornly refuses to correct even after 40+ years. I challenge anyone who thinks this book deserves 5 stars to actually read it closely, you will find an inexcusable mistake on the ""Saturday"" page. According to the text, the caterpillar eats through ""one slice of salami"", yet the picture shows something entirely different. In fact, the caterpillar does not eat through one slice of salami, he eats through the entire salami (the slices remain uneaten).I am dumbfounded how hundreds of people can rate this book so highly with this gleaming error. I guess it shows how poorly we have become at reading comprehension. Even after 40 years, the author has made no effort to fix it. Therefore I am forced to rate this book no higher than 2 stars. You try explaining to a little kid what ""slice"" means after reading this book, I dare you."
3,not what I expected,"The book was Ok I love Eric carl's books but I thought that the game was included in the book, instead it was attached to the pages so that made it hard to read the book for children and when I tried to detach the game it tore the page."
4,"Good book, my son loves the crinkly pages",My 5 month old loves this book. His favorite thing to do is scrunch it up in his hands because of the crinkly sounds it makes. He also loves pulling at the little caterpillar and running his fingers over the apple. Lots of textures and bright colors make this a winner for us!
4,"The ""be careful with it"" book . . .","Our two-year-old loves this book, but we wish we had been the ones to open in the first time (rather than him ""helping"" us) because some of the parts can stick and will need a bit of gentle persuasion to get everything working properly. Love the story and the artwork, and the pop-ups operate differently on every page so the interest remains high. Recommended for supervised reading with gentle little ones, or older ones who can treat a book well."
4,The Kids love it,Bought this for an International school overseas to help teach English to elementary school kids. The Kids and Teachers love it. The giant size edition allows the teacher to hold it up and the whole class to see.
5,i love it,"great book, my baby are intrigued by this book when i read it, i would def. recommend this book to buy."
4,Childrens Book,Great book to read children teaching them the life cycle of the caterpillar. Beautiful illustrations. Is a favourite with my children.
3,wrong item sent,I ordered this item with the book and plush toy and what was sent was only the board book. I received an e-mail from the supplier on my satisfaction and notified them immediately of the error. The correct set was never sent nor was I credited on my account for the item. This is very poor business on the part of the supplier. I am going to try again to get this item resolved.
5,"Munch, munch, munch!","This book is great in that it not only teaches the life cycle of a butterfly, counting to 5, the names of the days of the week, and about different types of food. The actual holes in the book create an intrigue and imagination that a caterpillar really munched his way through.The easy-to-read worlds makes good teaching tool for young children."
4,Hungry Caterpillar,The book is a family favorite but I was disappointed with the plush caterpillar. It's really very small.
2,Great quality boring book,"Got this book for my daughter. She doesn't really like it since it's ""boring"". Good build quality though and lasted through teething very well."
5,"Fun, lovely story with fantastic illustrations","This is a sweet story with beautiful illustrations. My twins have been enjoying listening to me read it to them since they were about 6 months, and all three of us still enjoy it and will likely continue for many years."
4,Pretty Good!,This album's got some really good music! It's pretty relaxing to listen to. It's a good album put together and if you like the show you'd like the soundtrack too! The album contains a good combanations of different music and doesn't just focus on one type of music. I personally liked this album!
2,Not very space efficient!,"These baskets are not worth the money! The wicker is a bit on the cheap side and they are not space efficient at all!!! They have a small base and it widens vertically. What you have is a basket that looks big but can't fit too much things because of the small base. I ended up purchasing other baskets for my baby's room...ones that had the same size base as the top. It was too much of a hassle to return them so they are stored away in the closet, holding junk items."
2,smaller than expected,"I wish I paid more attention to the reviews when I purchased these baskets. As the other reviewers pointed out, these baskets are smaller than I had expected. Also, the two baskets are not the same size."
4,good discussion of the subject,"This is a very good discussion of sigils, with many different possibilities. I don't understand why it needs the aura of magic. Sigils are basically a shorthand expression of intent. Intent creates everything in life. The clearer the intent, the clearer the results. I have not found myself needing any of that other occult stuff, I like this book because it talks about making clear statements of intent, and then summing them up in a shorthand so others don't muddy it with their intent. This has to be a reprint, I bought my copy over 10 years ago."
5,Awesome!,I love how this book makes something not well known so simple to do and so very easy to understand. :)
4,Good beginning,"Sharon Sala gets the Year of Living Dangerously off to a good start in Mission: Irresistible. I loved East and I eventually came to like Alicia, even if she was another stunningly beautiful model-type whose also a genius. Guess we can't have a plain genius heroine. The beginning was a little slow but I didn't care because I enjoyed the characters so much. Ms. Sala did a great job setting up the SPEAR agency. This book is the only one of the SPEAR books I've read so far to take advantage of all the Mission: Impossible-type possibilities this series offers. I thought the whole idea of the van was great. This was a good beginning that left me wanting to read more of the series."
4,Slingbox,"I have found this product quite remarkable. I have an office in my home, and do a lot of work over the internet. No matter where I am, I am able to conduct business and even listen to music stored on my computer even when I am away. It is just like taking my office with me, no matter where I am."
2,"Works, but not ready for prime time?","This is a great idea for those who travel, have 2 homes or do not want an extra cable/ satelllite box and TV in the bedroom. Does what it says, but read and understand the fine print. Only works with Windows XP and some mobile devices (at extra cost). There is no Mac, Linux software which has been promised since January 2006.The sling ethernet AC wall plug option is a waste of time. You need a hardwire ethernet connection to your internet local LAN and good bandwidth from your ISP to make it worth while. Bottom line is this is still an early adaptor technology, but will work well with some tweaking and patients"
4,Slinbox,"The box had to be connected to the main router . It is pretty cool, but if one person is traveling and uses the slingbox to watch tv, the person at home gets the same channel.They need make it so the person at home can watch one channel and the traveller can watch another.It was fairly easy to set up if you are geeky."
1,amazon fails to deliver,amazon attempted to charger twice for this item when it failed to deliver it.
5,Gotta Get It!!!,"Oh my! This item exceeded my expectations. I have a T-1 (neighborhood shared) at home and DSL at the office, so it is like watching DirectTV on my TV at my office. You can watch shows that are on you DVR, change channels,etc. It is SO worth the money! Santa is handling out a couple more this season!"
3,Does the job but no substitute for a real TV,Setup took longer than expected. For some reason setting up with wireless connection doesn't work for me. Wired setup worked without any issues.I recently when overseas and used slingbox for several days before it stopped working. I tried logging as admin and guest but I still was not able to connect. When I returned to the US it started to work again.Video quality leaves something to desire. It's great as long as you don't need to read anything on the screen. Text looks very rough.
5,Great works!!!,This is a very nice book for me because I have never seem such great works in fabric. Highly recommend to anyone who love doll making.
5,Terrific book,"I bought this book to learn how these amazing figures were constructed but was even more surprised when my husband ""borrowed"" it from me as inspiration for figures and the human form for his drawings. I haven't seen the book since!"
4,More wonderful creatures...,"A wonderful resource for anyone interested in the world of Krynn, especially those running a game set in the world. It provides an array of choices for creatures unique and native to this campaign setting for those DMs wishing to use creatures native to Krynn instead of those generic creatures from the Monster Manual series."
5,Good product.,We're using this to catch moths and bugs for our baby toads. It works well and the toads are growing quickly.
5,I am in awe,"I completely agree with the previous [more articulate] reviewer - this is brilliant. I enjoy electronic/trance music, but listen to a lot of different genres. As I listen, I feel like I'm traveling down a long river that passes many scenes of incredible beauty and variety. multiple eargasms guaranteed."
3,An accessible rock album from an underappreciated band,"Allow me to begin by saying that I always felt America was not ready for Krokus. They should have sold more albums, particularly as some of them were stunningly good and more than a little ahead of their time.Heart Attack is clearly Krokus attempt to modernize their sound to compete with Bon Jovi and Whitesnake. It is, therefore not really indicative of their body of work as a whole. There are some weak songs on here.But when Krokus hit it, like in the song ""Let It Go"", they knock it out of the park. The best moments of this album benefit from the beefier production, and there are at least four really strong songs on here.If you already like Krokus, you'll want it. If not, you might want to start on an album like ""The Blitz"". For the burgeoning new hair metal fan, this will satisfy you, but not necessarily blow you away. I feel the first three songs are the strongest, but those are strong songs."
4,cute but black outline falls out,"The ring is really nice. I got it as a Valentines Day present for my boyfriend, and he loved it. BUT the black outline immediately started falling out around the top right three keys, & it is steadily wearing away. Besides that it looks the same as in the image. It is a thick, sturdy, masculine ring."
2,Too soft for me,"The thicker pink foam/sponge is very soft. Thinning out petals is particularly tough on the thick sponge. I like the thinner sponge (it is a harder foam material), however I think it would be even better if this was even 1/16"" thicker. For now I will stick with the foam I bought from Michaels (the type that children use for crafts)."
1,Very bad service,I bought an e-machines computer 3 months back and have had all sorts of problems with this computer in 3 months. I have been very unhappy the way I have been dealt with. I just talked to a guy call Dustin (or Justin) who would not tell me his real name and said Dustin in the corporate office is all I need to know. He also said there is no one else I could speak to and he had no supervisor (It all ended at him is what he said). He was extremely arrogant and had no tact to talk to a customer who has been frustrated by a bad product.Stay away from e-machines
1,Watch the Shipping!,"I ordered the pink burp cloths for my first born because they were cute and the price was fantastic. I thought to myself, ""why would I want to spend more than I need to on something my child is just going to throw up on?"". I ordered three sets, and after checking out realized the shipping was more than the price of all three combined! No thanks, I'll just make my own."
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE,Very cute and thick. They seem like they will last a while and you cant beat the price for the quality.
5,Great!,"These are awesome! They absorb well and are just the right size! Plus, they are really cute. I will likely buy more of them."
4,Great little safe~,"I got this today and I have to say I'm very impressed with it. It has plenty of room to store some cash, however if you want major storage space such as for paperwork then you'll need something else.I had some slight concerns about the paint since it does have a small chip on it (very small) so I coated it with clear polyurethane spray and it looks great.If someone were to pick it up and shake it they would know it's not a shaving cream can (you can hear the stuff inside) however if you were very concerned about that I think you could put something like a sock in there to prevent movementOverall, it looks TOTALLY authentic and works great."
5,This safe is neat,I got this as a gift for Christmas. It was great and really a good price. And above all it is a practical gift. It is a really barbasol can and you can tell the bottom screws off.
4,It is what is claimed.,"The can is just like a real shaving cream can, but realize that there is not a lot of room in the can. For larger items consider a book safe."
3,Ok...works for now,"Not the best security but work for stashing away some docs and a couple bucks . Not bad at all for the price, every house can use one. But again not the best security I wouldnt put more than 20 bucks in it"
5,Panasonic Phone System,"I bought this system for my elderly parents. They don't have to worry about trying to get to the one phone they had in the house. Now, they have one in the kitchen, living room and bedroom. My mother has a slight hearing problem, and the ""slow talk"" feature works great for her. This was an excellent choice."
5,Just what my child needed - Charging kit Samsung T9,Exactly what I needed to enable my daughter to not rely solely on recharge from a computer USB port
5,wonderful,i dont know how anyone could not LOVE this movie. such a great fairy tale growing up i soooooooo wanted to go to santas house in this movie!!! brings back great memories!!!
5,"People-pleasing recipes, also very helpful for beginners","We have used the Joyce Chen Cook Book for 35-odd years and still rely on it regularly. It is full of tasty, authentic Chinese recipes, but they please the Western palate also. It contains classic, solid, proven recipes. You can skip the MSG."
2,Not cohesive,"The plot was disjointed, and if anything played on old hostilities. Compare this to 'Death in Paradise'. That has humour as well as suspense."
1,Offensive language,"Yeah, it's Irish and yeah, it's UK, but a TV show with the f*** word every other sentence? I don't need it. I'll go back to Poirot."
2,Wedding Kit for Dummies,"The wedding kit book constantly refers to chapters you should reread in the weddings for dummies book, so if you do not own BOTH books, it's useless. The wedding planner on the cdrom is only a demo version, and only allows you to add ten guests, and expires after a few weeks. I did however find some of the standard planning forms very useful, but you could find all and more of the info included in this book online if you really wanted to save yourself the money."
4,For A Stressfree Marriage Ceremony!,"This book was a real life saver for my wife and I when we got hitched last Fall. With all the trivia and stress that's related to a wedding-this is a no-brain BUY for any engaged couple IMO. From A to Z , things we never thought of to the obvious we were walked through as though the book was written AT us! There is a lot of psycological wisdom that truely eased the trivial stresses that went hand in hand (fun intended) leading up to and through our wedding. We weren't so exhausted from planning, etc to enjoy the HONEYMOON!! Thanks for a great book!"
2,pass on this one,"I can't comment on any other of his efforts but this one is not very good. In fact, it's somewhat hard on the ears. Much better choices in this genre are Guy Davis, Eric Bibb and Buddy Guy."
3,Magic for all ages,"The age range of this book is stated as 4-8 and nothing could be further from the truth. I am 61 and have been in magic for 35 years. This book works for all ages and skill levels.It features basic skills (double lift, etc.), applies them into interesting effects and adds the history of magicians for continuity. This is an ideal text to teach or learn from, or as a quick reference when you need new material."
3,This is an educational theory book,"This book discusses the history and theory of professional learning. Schon spends a great deal of time justifying what every professional knows - that framing problems is difficult and that book learning is insufficient to deal with these problems.If you are interested in positivism, technical rationality, and the evolution of the modern professional school, then this book is loaded with meaty material. If, however, you want to apply methods built upon other epistemologies, go straight to his 2nd book, ""Educating the Reflective Practitioner"".The book is well thought out, but I found it a heavy read. Not for the faint-of-heart.I got a lot out of it. Recommended only for epistemology or history of professional school wonks."
5,Gotta Have it,"This is the third time I have read this book. Along with Dewey's How We Think I always get something new. Needs to be read by anyone who teaches, especially professionals"
5,What a great little cup,"I wish I had more of these. Its amazing how many uses they have. I bought mine locally, and when I went back to get another they didn't have them anymore. :( I won't order one online because the shipping is twice the value of the cup. Makes no sense. But I'd recommend this little cup if you can find one or two."
5,Best new rock band in 2000!!!!,"Enation is the"" best"" new rock band I have heard in this decade!!! Jonathan, Richard, Amber,Dan, and Michael all blend together superbly, to bring each and every song to a wonderful blend of vocals, quitar,drums,& keyboard.. I get the chills at times... I listen to it all the time, and wouldn't think of ever shelving it.... It is a must for everyone to include in their music collection.... Great Job!!! Enation, keep us filled with your great sounds alway's!!!!! P.S. If you ever get the chance to see them Live, do it... I've seen them perform both in L.A. and Portland.... Sincerely, Faye"
5,I really like this grinder,"The vac attachment is really what makes this grinder a cut above the rest. I wish it has more power, it does tend to bog down, but that may be just from me feeding it too fast. But there is absolutely no dust. I have three vac hose extensions so the vac can stay outside while I was grinding concrete inside the house. The vacs filter will often clog so remember to empty often and do not breathe the harmful concrete dust.The diamond cut wheel lasted much longer than I expected. It was a big time saver removing overspray and adhesives from a concrete slab."
4,My Thoughts,"As an avid internet surfer I can relate with a lot of stuff in this work, it was well written and well thought out.The internet can be cruel as well as kind, we are all now taking it all for granted as its becoming part of everyones life.Blogs are extensions of the website front page and chatroom dialogue, This comes together excellent and anyone who surfs the big wide web will relate to this. Good piece of work, well worth reading."
3,no change,"I recently adopted two #130 Rotties. Great dogs, one is 11 years old and is a health management issue but still ambulatory. The other is 7 years old and is starting to show navicular problems. I tried the Dasuquin and noted no change in movement or behavior in either dog. I'm going to try other forms of this stuff. As for taking the stuff- I didn't have a problem but food doesn't slow down in their mouths. Hope this works better for others. I do think this stuff is way over priced."
5,Dasuquin,"We purchased this product based on the recommendation of our vet. Our bulldog had been limping on his back leg. The vet believed it caused by arthritis. We began with 2 pills a day. After 6 weeks we noticed a huge difference in our dog. His limp has almost gone! He occasionally limps after a long walk, but this product has done wonders for our dog!!! I am returning to order another supply!! I would definately recommend this product and vendor. They ship really fast!"
5,Great!,Amazing stuff. Our bulldog went from using only 3 legs to actually running on all 4! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STUFF!Without this product the dog Would have been put down b/c we couldn't afford a double hip replacement for him. He's been taking it daily for over a year with fantastic results.
1,Dasuquin,This product has done a great deal for my 8 year old English mastiff. He is moving better and getting up and down with less discomfort. I hasn't cured him but live is easier for him now.
3,doesn't seem to work with arthritis,"Seems to help some for a while, but had to go to a prescription anti-inflammatory, to help, could just be the individual case of my dog, it followed knee surgery in Feb 2011."
2,Beware,"The author, Mr. Matthew Fox, denies basic truth of Christianity, while using the Bible to advance his own non-Christian agenda. Saint Paul in his letter to the Collossians is worth quoting here: ""Brothers and sisters: As you received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him, rooted in him and built upon him and established in the faith as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. See to it that no one captivate you with an empty, seductive philosphy according to the tradition of men, according to the elemental powers of the world and not according to Christ"" (Col 2:6-15). Yes, this book is dangerous! It attracts readers with a catchy title and exposes them to a lot of lies! Beware."
2,misleading photo,"I ordered this based on the picture, expecting it to be a brief-style jock. It is not, I just received it and it is just a normal jock with the two straps in back. Not at all what I was expecting."
2,Staywell 500 Infra red cat door w/blu keys 580BLUUS,"We bought one 6 months ago & the problems we have had with it are:It's noisy. We have it near our bedroom & it wakes us every time a cat comes in. If one of the cats decides to 'camp out' by the door, we have to wake/get up & remove the collar.The collar keys get wet & need replaced.MAIN problem: Can't get the BLUE keys we need as they no longer carry them in stock, even direct at manufacturer.. Have to replace ALL keys (3) every time you lose/damage one.Would not purchase another one. Have decided to try one more time with the YELLOW keys to make this expensive investment work. If the new keys aren't made any better, we will have to turn it off & use it as an OUT ONLY door and manually let cats IN. Defeats the purpose.I would not buy another one."
1,This product is garbage,"The door is made with flimsy plastic retainers which the neighborhood cats enjoy ramming to pop the door off its housing and get into my house. The infra red transmitter must be oriented perfectly on the cat collar to function. After 3 weeks of use, the motor which controls the locking mechanism gave up. I would feel ripped off paying $30 dollars for this, but having paid $100... grrrrrr."
2,Toshiba Qosmio G15 Issues,Great computer... when it works. Serviced 5 times before Lemon law took affect. Get extended coverage for a long period of time and enjoy it while you can.
3,Case Review,"I like the case it is very sturdy,but the case has a flap on the side the allows it to open without much effort, the clip came apart two days after I received it,but I like it overall"
3,For those who read German,"I had to give up on this book after 150 pages. As the first reviewer mentioned, much of the book is not translated from the German. Robertson quotes lines, paragraphs, and even complete stories all in the original German and then draws conclusions from it. If you do not read German - and it would take too long to translate it - the text is barely comprehensible. This book needs to be fully translated into the English language for those of us who do not read German. For those who read German, I recommend it. For those who don't, be warned."
3,"Fun, but a little too easy","This book is a great introduction to Pixel puzzles. If you like math and logic puzzles, you'll probably like these too. They are fun and most of the puzzles can be completed fairly quickly. If you're ready for more of a challenge, I recommend Mind Sharpening Pixel Puzzles or Perplexing Pixel Puzzles. To give you an idea of the difference, you could probably complete the entire Paint by Numbers book in the time it would take you to complete one of the more challenging puzzles in the Perplexing Pixel Puzzles book. The pictures in the pixel books are much more intricate and interesting too."
1,Not much more than a collection of anecdotes,"This book consists of a collection of anecdotes rather than a comprehensive view and of the very interesting question: How revolutionary ideas propagate in the scientific community, and through the history. The author managed to track almost all copies of the book, as if this was his main goal, but did not manage to organize the data into a nice or clear picture."
3,Disappointed with Dakota Smashed Pea Recipe,"There is something definitely wrong with the Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley Soup recipe. It never calls for a hand-held blender to puree the peas (which is VERY necessary to make it like the restaurant), and the result after following the recipe to a T was terrible. Could be me, but we're unhappy with our first go at this..."
3,"Fun to read, but recipes are long and complicated","Recipes are long and involved and needing lots of ingredients. I did enjoy reading it tho, and I have made a few salads an d sandwiches. The cookbook is very colorful, great photos of dishes. I love CPK by the way!"
2,super crossword book,I did not like this crossword book at all. I am a crossword entusiast and am always looking for challenging puzzles. This book is filled with no sense games that are impossible to solve. I want a book with only crossword puzzles.Kathy
5,"How to dispell the confusion, really!!","This is the best book with a clear arrow into the heart of the Gospel.No one has done what Fitz does, well Paul Zahl does it too.Fitz will take you back to what the gospel truly is and just for beginners it will eradicate you confusion for ever.It is written with the all time major issues that trouble every human, namely: Guilt, Anger, Self-esteem and Death.No one is as good as this Author. It is short, clear, to the point. It avoids the Niagara of paper written everyday that says nothing.Amazing book, stunningly riveting.After being involved consciously in the Christian world for 56 years, I have concluded that most true Christians (they are Christians) but they DO NOT UNDERSTAND the gospel....I did not....C, Fitzsimons Allison does.David"
4,Ideal for?,"The collection of essais (forewords or afterwords) on non-existent major books of our future. Perfect food for thought, but rather bleak in reading comfort - a little bit too dry and condensed. It's not a blood thriller(s), even if dissecting thrilling matters.Anyway, it is a must for any real SF fan. Especially after Star diaries, Futurologic congress and things like Peace on Earth and Fiasco."
1,cash register,This register sucks! The tape don't roll it self it jamms all the time. A total waste of money. To some it up in one word junk!
1,What is wrong with you people,"You're not going to be able to sell either book if you keep putting down each other's material. You should know that bad-mouthing the competition reduces your credibility immensely in the eyes of the customer.Just give honest reviews. I for one am not going to buy either book because I can't get the truth. Just be honest and you'll sell more. Geeze, I know that and I've been in auto sales for 3 weeks."
5,~~A MUST READ for Anyone Buying a Car at a Dealership~~,"This book was written mainly for the inexperienced car salesman, but it also an excellent tool for the buyer who wants to learn all the sneaky, sleazy techniques the pros use to manipulate you. This knowledge allows you to avoid getting getting caught up in the hype and make a rational buying decision. ""Money is Power"" (says so right in the book) - YOU have the money, and THEY want it. Being aware of how will try to get it from you can save you hundreds if not thousands of dollars on your next vehicle purchase. Very much worth the price - consider it a wise investment."
2,Seemed like a good idea,"This is one of the highest capacity shoe racks that fits over a door. However, you can't really fit 30 pairs of shoes in it. Depending on the type of shoe (sneakers, wedges or platforms, for instance), in some cases only one of your shoes will fit in the hole. Also, the slots for the shoes are very short- they are designed for the back of the shoe to hang out, but again, depending on the shoe, sometimes more than just the back hangs out, and the shoes fall out when you open or close the door. Since the shoes hang out, heals will hang down and cover the opening to the slot under it, so you may not be able to fit any shoes in the slot below.I've still been trying to pack plenty of shoes into it, and after a few months it is starting to come apart at the top, but it hasn't completely given in yet."
2,Nothing special,"It's not a bad music phone with the dedicated music keys, but it's not the most stylish ones out there. I would say it's great for the younger generation and would rather not have to take it out in a meeting. I ended up returning it as there was no T mobile coverage in my area. I probably wouldn't buy it again even if my current provider had it..."
3,Battery Life ruins the phone,"I got this phone two days ago and i was really excited about it. The mp3 player had pretty good quality right out of the phone and it was pretty cool all in all. However, after a day of having the phone with very minimal use (a few phone calls, listened to maybe 2 or 3 songs) the phone was dead. The battery life is way too short for me and i think i'm going to have to go back to t-mobile to exchange for something different."
2,Better than me treo is what rep said,"After spending over 5 minutes trying to get the back off (don't know if it was defective or not), I noticed that I had one bar for a signal (where I normally have 3-4). That was the first sign that I was going to have problems. I finally removed back and put battery in. The menu is not user friendly, too much to do to get to one place. I was not able to receive messaging (which I had subscribed to) and upon transerring my card everything just went haywire. After being on the phone waiting for tech support, I was able to finally use the phone. Not happy with reception. The phone is small and lightweight and that's good. I'm going back to my Treo and the 5300 is going back to Tmobile."
3,Volume is horrible,"I just bought this phone not even a week ago and I love the phone's features . . . but when you are making/receiving calls, the volume is horrible. I have a boyfriend that lives in Hawaii and I couldn't hear a thing he was saying because the volume is too low. It wasn't just with him but even with other phone calls. After going to the T-mobile store, and checking out a few other Nokia's, I noticed the volume was the same in those phones as in this one so I'm assuming it's just a Nokia thing.Also, the slider seems a bit flimsy. I wish they would have made this metal because the plastic comes off rather cheap.I'm giving it a 3 because the main point of a phone is to make/receive calls and if you can't hear, that's a big problem.I am not exchanging it for the Samsung T629."
3,Missing a Song!,"The movie ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" was a beautiful, inspiring film. Alas, the soundtrack is missing one of the key songs -- ""Corazon de Acero."" It's a big oversight -- the songs included don't really make for a great CD."
3,Lots of extras,"I didn't realize all of the shorts and extra behind-the-scenes included in the DVD. I was pleasantly surprised by it. I actually remembered the Three Caballeros differently from when I was a child. It was still interesting, but it's really odd. I think I liked the old shorts more than the features."
1,"Poor product, poor service!","I purchased Gyration's mouse and keyboard, installed per directions and it does not work. It synched up fine but the connection is intermittent at best. After fiddling for some time with it I called Gyration's support number only to find out that there is apparently a glitch with XP Service Pak 2 and the proper operation of the mouse and keyboard. When I asked to return the Mouse/Keyboard I was told that it was a software problem not a hardware problem. ARE YOU kidding??? Service Pak 2 has been out for 9 months. There is nothing about this on Gyration's trouble shooting website about the problem. Gyration knows there is a problem with the world's number one operating system and their product yet they continue to sell the product with out notice of the problem, OUTRAGEOUS!"
3,"Great mouse, terrible battery life","Although the mouse is an ergonomic dream and works very well from a distance, I've found that I have to keep a spare mouse handy for those times that this one fails to make it back on the charger. The battery life, if left off the charger, is about a day.When the mouse is fully-charged, you can use it from across the room as a pointer. The Keyboard has been a little more difficult to keep connected to the wireless USB connection, but it does the what it's supposed to do as a secondary keyboard. It's also much smaller than a normal keyboard -- even smaller than my laptop keyboard.For the price, I'd expect a lot more out of this set."
5,Excellent book!,Fantastic book! Unique and compelling insights and powerful and practical advice.His CDs are equally inspirational.
1,Poor Formatting Makes This Hard to Use,"Having had good luck with other study guides by this publisher, I ordered this one unseen. I expected plain formatting on paperback quality paper, and got that. I did not expect ""typewriter-style"" formatting that was obsolete twenty years ago, and rather poorly done even by those standards. The book is almost impossible to use because of this, and there is absolutely no excuse for it. Do not buy this."
4,Chemistry Tutor,The Chemistry Tutor was helpful and informative. Bought this for my 15 year-old who said it really helped her with information not covered in class or by her teacher.
3,"""I am alive and you are dead"" ***","""he needs to flesh it out"", well but he died 20 years ago...this said I don't think we can call the book ""useless"" compared to the movie as it is a proper nonsense. The book in itself has a nice packaging but better get this short story along with others in collected stories books ( cheaper ). Anyway it's good to see this genius getting all the attention he deserves from the masses. I wish his work was more widely known, for me he is not a sci fi writer, he is 'the' sci fi writer. I also wish I could see an adaptation of his work by a movie maker whose style really matches Dick's...the title of one of his biographies..."
3,"Awesome book, terrible layout","Just want to warn people to ignore dolts who claim this book doesn't help them understand the movie, or who think the book was written after the movie, or who think the brilliant author Philip K. Dick is still alive. This is an incredible short story, written decades ago, but if I were you I'd buy an anthology of Dick's stories and stay away from this weird marketing gimmick. The only merit it has, perhaps, is as a collector's item for fans of things like that. I enjoyed the spin Spielberg and his fellow writers used for the story, but found the movie version less interesting than the story. If you really want to bend your mind, buy a Philip K. Dick anthology or his ""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich."" Cheers!"
4,Great Read for Industry Insiders and All,"Well written and easy to read, Dawn Steel combines key events in her life with key strategies to make it in today's entertainment world. The book is humorous and enlightening. It may not be The Art of War, but it's a great read none-the-less. It's just too bad the book was so hard to find. No longer available as a new buy, it is readily available in the used book market. Although Dawn left us in 1997, her spirit lives on within each page read. A recommended read for those looking to learn the basic principals of succeeding in this industry."
2,One of the weakest episode of UFO Files,"I am a huge fan of UFO Files. What I like about this show is that very often they investigate cases that are not well known, like the UFO Crash in China or the case of Shag Harbour. I've learned a lot just by watching the show.This episode of UFO Files is, in my opinion, one of the worst episode in the history of the show. Why this episode have its own DVD is beyond me. The cases investigated in this episode are boring, not interesting and very disappointing. I mean there are so many supposed ""Alien Encounters"" each and every year and this is the best they could do ?? Also the reenactment of the events are so badly done that at one point I was laughing.This is by far one of the weakest episode of UFO Files. I really hope that one day The History Channel will release all the episodes on DVD. Don't buy this DVD, it's a waste of time and money."
1,Warning: May not be a good introduction!,"This book is meant as an introduction to Ayn Rand's philosophy. Yet is it really good as an introduction? See the Letter to the Editor at the Intellectual Activist website in which David Harriman, Gary Hull, Andrew Lewis, and Leonard Peikoff state that this book is definately not.If you are looking for an introduction to Objectivism you are better served by Ayn Rand's own intro in The Voice of Reason."
2,"Second hand Ayn Rand: A laudable goal, poor execution","As Greg Johnson puts it at The Daily Objectivist website: ""For someone who is relatively ignorant of and new to Rand's thought Gotthelf's book gets a grade of C+. Although his Introduction begins promisingly with an explication of a passage from Atlas Shrugged, his exposition of Rand's philosophy begins with two chapters on metaphysics, followed by two chapters on epistemology. Only then does he deal with Rand's moral philosophy, which receives barely eleven pages. Rand's political philosophy receives one page, and her aesthetics receives one and a half. But the relative weights he gives to the different branches of philosophy results in an extremely abstract, unaccommodating, and off-putting introduction to Rand's thought. All evidence indicates that this book was written and published with great haste and little attention to detail."" A better introduction to Rand would be her own ""For the New Intellectual""."
2,Don't buy!,"We bought it for my grandson's birthday and we spent half the time with it on a charger. Then, after two weeks, it wouldn't even hold a charge. Don't waste your money."
2,"Well made, but small","The product seems well made, but it is very small to use for the stated purpose of cracking lobster claws. I finally replaced my antique nut cracker, which has served me well for lobster shells. I deliberately ordered this heavy duty product to be sure that it was up to the task. I can use it, but it was much easier with the traditional (allegedly NOT heavy duty) nut crackers. Had I do to it over, I would not have bought the product. Unfortunately, because it is well made, unless I want to replace it with a larger one, I am probably stuck for decades!"
4,if you don't have one get one.,The disappearance was a very good book.And if I was the auther I think you very proud.And think you shounld read are reread the disappeance. And if you don't have one get one. It is a good teen book.
3,Great idea gone bad,"Like the ones I had as a kid only smaller, cheaper and poorly made. Thanks China for more lost jobs and cheap stuff. My grandkids and I got off a few good shots before it self destructed. Very instructional.........they learned not to buy any more China knock offs."
2,Ohh memories,I remember having these as a kid I remember shooting them high in the air without issue and watching them sale back to the earth and doing it again and again and again. This one while looks the same does not perform the same. It's difficult to use and does not nearly fly as high. The quality is just not what I remember
1,It just doesn't work,"I purchased this for a projectile motion/trajectory lab for a junior high school. When we went out to try it for the first time, it leaked (O-ring did not seal) and we couldn't build up any pressure in order to get it to fire. It may be just this one, but, understandably, it is not very well constructed. I hope to find another manufacturer that makes one of higher quality."
1,Waste,"The author didn't have any purpose. This book was short and boring. He used a computer to create a list of anagrams of FSM related words. The list of anagrams alone takes up about half of the book. In the other half, he talks about the anagrams. There isn't anything clever or revealing about them. It's mostly a series of, ""Oh, isn't it a coincidence that this is an FSM anagram?"" moments. He also writes about how great his FSM logo is and how it's better than the more common ones. Please don't waste your time or money."
5,Darling little book.,My Mom is in the Alzheimer's journey. I use the I Spy books for her to keep her mind working as best it can now. We make it a game & everyone like them. Anyone you hand it to enjoys hunting.
2,Couldn't GetThrough It,"This book could not hold my attention at all, and I LOVE to read. He just goes on and on about his relationships with the various women who work for him. There is one part where there seems to be a plot but, he doesn't develop it. He introduces so many female characters it's hard to keep them straight. I'll try to give this book another go later, maybe then it will be better."
3,Lacks ratings,"Book was informative. The lack of any critical ratings, reviews or ""best lists"" was disappointing. This is the reason why I buy travel books."
4,Renaissance Music at it's Finest..,"This is a great cd and I encourage you to buy it. But not from these people on here. If you can't find it for a cheaper price, I suggest joining Naxos. You can record it."
4,great stuff,"I got into Saga about a year or two ago and was more or less concentrating on the later post 90's stuff. I must say that exploring the first few Saga recordings has been a fun experience and I enjoyed the ""Saga"" recording very much. 'Humble Stance"" and the ""Perfectionist"" are the two stellar songs on the CD but overall very good for what they were trying to do way back in the day."
4,"""Progressive"" Rocks","I first heard Saga in the early 1980's and immediately took a liking to them. The composition and lyrics are thoughtful and inventive. Being a musician myself, I have always enjoyed originality in music. All the great groups have a unique sound, style, rhythm, and intelligence that seems to be lacking in much of today's music. I turn on the radio and often, cannot distinguish one group from another. Not so with Saga. One listen and this group clearly stands out.If you like Kansas, Rush, Yes, and others of that calibre, you'll love Saga."
2,Black CZ 1.0 Carat Size Brilliant Cut Stud Earrings,"The price is cheap but the item has a tiny cut in the face. However, because its price is cheaper than the shipping cost, so that, I did not send it back."
3,Came with a free gift...,"Book is in great shape. No markings or highlighting. The only negative is that there was a huge deceased moth crammed between the latter pages of the book. Luckily he didn't leave a stain, just sort of crumbled off. I would suggest to the seller to please be more thorough in examining items prior to shipping. Otherwise happy with purchase."
3,OK,"liberal slant, but interesting. Quick way to learn a lot of history, but be aware it is a liberal view"
2,disrespectful,"This book seems respectful, only in that it appears to treat world religions with equal offense. I don't know; maybe they deserve it."
3,"Clock ok, projections is poor","The clock is ok, but the projection is poor.The light for the projection is very faint.The time for the projection has to be set separately from the main clock."
3,Krups 4-Slice Toaster,"I had been wanting to buy a 4-slice toaster for some time, and felt comfortable about ordering this toaster, as most reviews I read about it were positive. However, my first attempt yielded a machine with a left-side lever that did not work. My second attempt yielded one which burned the top of the bread while leaving the bottom untoasted. For some reason I persevered, and the third attempt brought me one that is satisfactory, although the browning is still somewhat uneven. The toast has a nice crispy exterior, and the features on the toaster are very good. I have given it a 3 star rating rather than a 4 star rating, because I think that Krups needs to pay more attention to its quality control and insure that every item shipped conforms to the same high level."
5,Romances I have read,"This vol one was written in 1986 by Susan Dobbe, cover Art by Steve Newcombe. This book will help the reader to remember the books they have read. The author has a list of the most popular numbered series in part 1. and an alphabetical list of many popular author's in part 2 with real names and pen names. At the end of part 2 are reserved pages for the reader's favorite writers not included in the book. The book covers Candlelight Ecstasy, Harlequin, Love swept, Silhouette and other Romance series. This book is a must for the serious Romance reader."
5,Precious and Few even better the 2nd time around,"I previewed Precious and Few before it went to print. I couldn't get enough of the book. Bonnie actually thought I was a little crazy because I was reading it just as fast as she was writing it. In the preview I mentioned that I had a feeling it was going to be a can't put it down, no matter what time of the night it was. Well, I wasn't kidding. I received the book and I started reading the published version. (2nd time reading the same book) how many times can you say you have actually done that? I forgot a lot of things that happened, and here I am at 1:30am, knowing I have to get up for work in 4 1/2 hours, and once again, I can't put the darn thing down. All I can say is Danielle Steele you had better start looking over your shoulder, there's a new author in town, and her name is Bonnie Sue Bradshaw. (I know that is really lame). Awesome writing, even better the second time around. Cheers Bonnie!Patty ShrenselSeaford, DE"
4,Decent Quality,"I bought this tie for my wedding. At fist, I was skeptical of buying this tie because of other reviews that I had read. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the product arrived to see that the quality was much better than I thought it would be. Because of the material, I am confident that this tie will last a LONG time. It doesn't seem like it can fray easily. Not the highest quality tie ever, but you get what you pay for. The only low quality aspect of this tie is the stitching job on the back, but that can easily be fixed."
2,"for actual use, it's not very helpful","I'm a mother with four children, and this book was a great disappointment. The recipes were too complicated for elementary students and too ""young"" for older kids. Also, most of the recipes called for ingredients that are not normally on hand. Needless to say, my kids never use it."
3,Inexpensive LRGB filter set,I don't know how these compare to other sets but they are definately less expensive. They are made for the Meade DSI series imagers but I was using them with another CCD and they worked just fine. The green seems a little weak but as I said most LRGB filter sets are a lot more money.
4,Very Comfortable Ring!,"This ring is comfortable as well as attractive. It is very easy to get on and off with the ""rolling"" action, especially if your fingers happen to be a little swollen one day. If you tend to fiddle with your jewelry like I do, you will really love playing with this ring as you go through the day. I love this piece!"
4,Good quality. Great price.,"I disagree with the previous review. Baby Jesus looks just fine. All the pieces are well made and have nice colors. For under $10, this is a great set."
3,Pretty but..,"This is a pretty set... Colors are nice, details are great for this price. Baby Jesus, though... he looks... more psycho than I'd expect a baby Jesus to look. Since He is the most important aspect of Chrismas I think he should be a little... less psychotic looking."
5,Life Size strips anorexia to bare skin and bone,"Jenefer Shute's Life Size is both darkly comical and hauntingly tragic. Narrating from her hospital bed, Josie the book's emaciated antagonist, recounts her downward spiral into anorexia nervosa and her brave and often inspirational climb out of it. This book will forever change the way you look at eating disorders, erasing the national stereotype that anorexics and bulimics destroy their bodies, minds and selves simply to emulate 90's ""it girl"" Kate Moss."
5,One of a Kind!,"AWESOME POSTER MUST HAVE FOR FIGHT CLUB ENTHUSIASTS! Great print quality! Very intricate poster, that hopefully no one else will have. Hate to see this for sell at a retail store. Making it mainstream."
1,Poor Quality,The quality of this item is very poor. The clasps on the end of the bands are made from plastic and break very easily. They should be made of metal for durability. Mine even arrived damaged. I cannot see how the clasps would last very long with normal wear.
2,"If you do not have the right type of door, its useless.",Price was good; Shipping and packaging was excellent; DVD supplied by pro gym was complete. I had a few questions about the product and customer service was prompt and they did everything possible to help me out. It was just that our inside doors in our home were just not conductive to the product.
2,Resistance Bands,Bands were sturdy but enclosed instruction booklet was not helpful at all. Additional equipment was required to attain maximum benefit of resistance band excerise.
3,GoFit Ultimate ProGym with DVD Revue,As a personal trainer this time of year is when my clients are starting to think about getting back on the golf course. The information presented in the video is worth while and the bands do work. All in all I'm pleased with the product. It works and is simple to use.
1,don't do it,"I have had othing but trouble with this. the velcro doesn't hold the straps, the plastic hooks shatter, the ropes are flimsy and when I repeatedly emailed the company I got no response whatsoever. a horrible product it would be much better to buy a set of weights and ankle sraps."
3,Good for Trunk excercises but DoesNot works for lower,This product is good for excercising arms and other parts of the trunk. But the leg straps donot work!Mine unstrap and fly off even on the lowest resistence on the 2nd rep of the excercise!Unless you would like to tie them with another string or use a band instead these may not work. I almost broke my glass door the first time I tried it.I would suggest the manufacturer to use a better locking system to secure the leg straps.Gaurav Mehra
3,Unsure of safety,"The product was exactly as described and was delivered in good time.However, the door block is meant to sit inside a hinged door and is used to anchor the rubber straps, but it does not allow my door to close when I insert it. According to the directions the door is not only meant to be closed but also to be locked. I find this impossible. I'm not comfortable with using it any other way, as I'm concerned that I could receive quite a nasty injury if it were to come unhinged while I'm stretching the straps. Most of the exercises require that the straps are connected to a door, so unfortunately I haven't actually used the product since I bought it."
4,Small dumbell replacement,"I got this package to substitute for smaller size dumbells. It seems to do the trick adequately. There're a couple of small issues that I have with it. First of all, the colors of these bands don't match those by other manufacturers. They have a light inscription as to what level of resistance they provide, but that gets rubbed off after just a couple of uses. Pretty soon you won't be able to remember which one is which and the box does not provide that information. P90X, for example, has a different color-to-resistance coloring.Another issue I have is with handles. While they're very comfortable to hold, the black ribbon that goes through them is hard to adjust. It's not freely moving and thus prevents you from adjusting your wrist positions.Other than that it's an OK band set to use. I don't know how long it'll last, but so far (1 month) it's holding on."
1,No way they tested these on humans before releasing them,"I've had a decent pair of resistance bands for years, but they started to shred a bit, so I picked up this set. I thought it was a great deal, as you could switch out the bands for different ""weights.""Great idea, terrible execution.The bands use carabiners so you can quickly switch out the bands. Unfortunately, they have sharp edges, and during the shoulder presses they were rubbing against my arms uncomfortably. When I finished the rep I noticed that I had actually cut into my skin and was bleeding.Yeah, should have stopped when I first felt it, I get that.Still, I can't believe that anyone actually used these before selling them to the public.Find another set of resistance bands, or buy multiple ones to change up the resistance."
5,Great wick for perfection heaters,"I purchased this on another website, but wanted to review it anyways. It fits my Perfection No.120 oil heater perfectly. Installed in under 5 minutes! Brought my 'new' old heater back to life! Highly recommended!"
2,zeroll disher 2060,I am really disappointed. I did not expect to get a product made in China. The sweep that is supposed to clean the bowl doesn't fully retract. I wil not order this item on line again.
1,Unrealistic,"I bought this book in a desperate search for something new to read and I just could not make it through! It was filled with simple, unrealistic characters! The mother was just unbelieveable (paying $100 for a parking space?...her own room at the church?..ridiculous) and the youngest daughter continued to her mom, ""mommy"" and act so immature; it got on my nerves! I was just so annoyed with the characters that I could not get into the story line, which was weak in itself. I just did not enjoy this book at all, there was no drama to speak of, just poorly written characters."
5,Excellent CD,This is a must for any Mississippi Hill Country blues fan! RL is breaking it down and showing why is a legend. Get it!!
1,Is this some kind of a joke?,"Ultra low budget, sloppily made with little or no spoken sound track. Models are just awful to look at. Sorry, but I couldn't get with this at all and I sent it back. Beware!"
2,what a disappointment!,"I love _Aslyum_ (1985) and _Island of Jewels_ (1986), so I figured the album that immediately preceded them had to be good--right? Well, maybe not. The experimentation that abounded on those albums is confined here to ""Rope & Glory"" and a few short bits at the ends of some tracks, making this album essentially a bunch of very similar gothic-sounding synthpop tracks with little creativity of melody and phrasing and almost identical texture. Imagine _Brighter Now_, but with no sense of humor, and every song trying too hard to sound like ""Golden Dawn"" from _Asylum_. The only thing keeping this from being a total failure is Ka-Spel's voice, and even that is absent when a painful female guest vocalist, credited as Lilly Ak, takes over for the song ""Astrid."" *shudder*"
3,Just colors...,"This is a beautiful set of 18 colors. I haven't used them, as I bought them as a gift for my niece. The description is incorrect. There is no water bottle or paper or anything included that I can see, just the colors. I paid $5.60 and still consider that a bargain for a very pretty set of 'real' watercolors for a budding artist."
1,Biggest Waste of Money,This machine is so loud you could hear it from space. And it's slow. Can't say anything good about it. Please don't waste your money.I won't buy a HP printer again. Everyone I've had has been completely useless.
5,Very Well Written,I highly suggest this book to anyone. I espescially liked the prehistoric setting. very original.
5,ONE TO REMEMBER!!!!,"This is defenetly ONE TO REMEMBER!! Ratha's creature came highly recomened by my big brother. I'm so glade I didn't ignore his recomendation!! You follow Ratha from her cub-hood struggles to her adult life. A wonderfull book and I recomend it to people who like books about animals with human emotions. I'm sure most who read the book would agree with me when I say this book is the best! This is my first time reading anything by Clare Bell, and I think I will read more. The emotions are so real that you can feel Ratha's joy and saddness. So well, infact it made me cry! This is mostly why I liked it I think. I normaly take a month to finish a short book,{out of lack of intrest in them} but it took me only two days to finish Rasha's Creature! If Clare Bell is reading this, I beg you to not deprive others of such a phenomenal book and put it back in print!!! On a scale of one-ten I give it a ten!! I loved it!!!"
4,Mixed emotions.,"Bosch is back and this time he's an official outsider instead of just the department lone wolf. Combine an injured cop and a cold case and throw in a little bit of Eleanor for good measure and you've got a classic Bosch book.Perhaps a little *too* classic-- while I enjoyed the book I didn't approach it with the same delight as I did the first few books. Some of the schtick feels a little too much like schtick. It (like Harry) feels like it's getting a little bit old and tired.The ending of this book implies a change in the weather for Harry, and I hope that Connelly follows through. Bosch has done his time and deserves to have a little bit of comfort in the world.If you haven't read Harry Bosch before, start with _Black Echo_ or _Black Ice_, but if you're already a fan this should deliver the fix that you need."
2,Formulaic - Not what I would expect from Connelly,"Don't get me wrong - if this were a first book, it would be good, maybe earning four stars. But I have learned to expect SO much more from Michael Connelly's novels about Harry Bosch. This doesn't even rate when compared with the magic of his early books in the series. The last chapter was so predictable, I was sure that it couldn't possibly enter a Connelly book. Maybe his editor wrote it? Almost makes me cry that he has copped out on Harry with this incredibly formulaic book."
3,Missing Text in Goding Genealogy,I felt the genealogy text as originally written was satisfactory. The book sold by Amazon had missing text due to cutting off part of the text when photo copying.This might be acceptable in a novel but in a genealogy book it is unacceptable and annoying.
5,HOotS Explains all on Ansalon Religion,"I must say, everything that I have ever wanted to know about the different religions on Ansalon is covered in this book. For those of you constantly struggling over how to pronounce a certain gods name is also covered, along with all their different names to the different nationalities of Ansalon. Highly recommend this book to all who travel the world of Krynn."
1,Wow...terrible.,"As a recent graduate of UCSB and a four-year resident of Isla Vista, I figured I had no choice but to check this book out. Wow, what a dissappointment! First of all, it's filled with typos. The author should learn the basics of punctuation before trying to tackle another book. Secondly, the narrative contradicts itself constantly (maybe no one - not even the writer himself - could bear to give it a read-through before printing). Lastly, it's just plain terrible story-telling. The book is not funny, interesting, believable, or unbelievable enough to be interesting. It reads like exactly what it is: a college-aged guy trying to sound like a drug-addled wild man. He's no Hunter S. Thompson (which is clearly who he, like most college guys who write, is aiming for). This book is good for a laugh, as some of it is so bad as to be amusing; but if you want to know what life in IV is like, take a trip there yourself, you definitely won't find it here. Terrible."
5,woodworking bible,This is my second copy of this venerable woodworking book. A wonderful resource for the serious woodworker. I bought my daughter a copy too.
3,truckers rule,as this is seen mostly in the season one episodes i thought this was truely a waste of money
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book for my grandson because I have recently told him about the wastefulness of using paper plates, bowls, etc, even if they are cute. It was my intent to reinforce this idea of not being frivolous with paper goods because they are manufactured from cut down trees. This book actually tells of the many products that are made from the trees and touches very little on the usefullness of the trees NOT being cut down for these products. Trees are such a valuable resource to our environment and I thought the book would talk about the trees usefullness as it pertains to our planet. It doesn't. It encourages the use of man-made products from the trees. Very disappointing."
2,It's okay if you can relate,"This book was okay if you have bulemia or anorexia. I could relate some of the parts of her feelings and concerns, but for a non-eating disordered person, this book would either give someone awful destructive habits or bore them to death!"
1,The worst Excuse for a Game,I was hoorified in the faulse presence the title gives the purchaser. It is not worth the little it costs it should be outlawed. Graphics suck Details Suck you name it it Sucks.
3,Only 50% true,"I've purchased DVD200 from Sony in Nov'03. This is how I feel so far.Pros..1) The clarity and resolution are really good.2) It is very easy to play back on TVCons..1) Mic picks up noise from spinning disc2) 1M digital camera is simpy useless (only if you never saw a dig camera, then you may appreciate this)3) DVD R/W media (DMW30)is not available in market, even at sony.com"
3,What does one wear to an End of the Empire party?,"This book is about late Western Roman archaeological finds focusing on wearable grave goods such as crossbow brooches, belt sets, beads, and bracelets. As interesting as the migration of styles and changing trends in fashions of this period are, the book fails to deliver much analysis of what these finds can tell us about the end of the Empire in the West. There are very few conclusions presented after the evidence is discussed and this was a real disappointment. The changing patterns of wearables along the Danube frontier is perhaps the only section in the book where the author clearly makes her point showing how this field of inquiry can tell us something specific about the geo-political situation at the end of the Western Empire.The study of fashion as modeled in the archaeological record can shed some light on the end of the Antiquity and the beginnings of the ""Dark Ages"". However, this book does not deliver on the promise of such research."
4,Runs smaller than anticipated,"Bought this to hold two Halloween wigs. I find that neither wig fits firmly on the head, the head runs just a bit smaller than I had anticipated. For whatever reason I thought the head would be more the size of a real person but that is my own mistake not the sellers. Also, I should point out, I have never owned a wig before and never owned a wig head before either, so adjust my review accordingly. :)Other than running slightly small than I expected, they are working out fine. There is even a hole in the bottom to post mount them."
3,Flat Nose Head,Received this item on time. Adequate for my needs. Packers need to be more careful when placing this next to hard surfaces--add some padding. The nose is not as seen in the picture--got misshappened.
4,Does the job,It's not the best foam head. It arrived slightly crushed and I had to resort to sticking a book to keep it from tipping it over. I would like for the packaging to be a little bit better next time but otherwise it does what it's supposed to do and my wig looks great on it.
1,Gouge you coming and going.,"The updates are frequent and expensive. Good program, but it's not worth the trouble and expense of upgrading."
3,Off Button doesn't work,"It's really nice to know for sure which batteries in the drawer are and aren't charged (and a little surprising to find a few that are DOA as soon as you open the package). Unfortunately the off switch doesn't work. To turn the unit off, you have to remove one of its batteries. An annoying flaw on an otherwise useful tool. :-("
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"I'd looked for years for this little book. I feel soooo lucky to have found it. Pricey, but because of its rarity it was well worth it. FAST shipping. Perfect transaction."
4,A little squishy for a new pillow,"I love latex foam pillows and at home, that is all I use. I previously bought my kids a couple elsewhere but that price had gone way up so I bought this one as a replacement for myself. After 20 or 30 years, the old ones do start to get a little rotten. It is nice but is a little soft and squishy for a new pillow. I like soft but would have liked a little more substance knowing that they get softer with age. For the price though, it is still a good pillow. It is definitely not for somebody who wants firm though."
1,Unbearable bad smell,"The pillow smells awful, I was not able to sleep on it. I tried hand washing it, but the pillow started falling apart. I let it dry for 4 days, and it was still wet and smelled even worse. I'm so sad I wasted my money on this."
3,Pillow not like my last latex!,"I was disappointed with this pillow - I have used a latex pillow for over 10 years and I found this one too firm. I suppose it will soften up with time but I've actually gone back to using my old one because I don't think I can stand using it during the ""break-in"" period. My old pillow, which is over 10 years old, was never too firm and has stayed comfortable all these years (not getting too soft, etc.). So I will probably use this new pillow as a guest spare and continue my search for a new latex pillow to replace my old one."
3,Too high,"After reading reviews, I decided to try this pillow. I wanted soft, which complaints seemed to indicate this pillow to be. It is somewhat soft, but too high for me to lay flat on my back without having my head cocked up. It's probably a good fit for side sleepers. I finally shaved over an inch off the top to get it low enough to not give me neck problems. Now one side is lumpy, but the pillow is usable. Solid Latex pillows are so hard to find (non locally) that I MIGHT order again when I need to replace it, if I still couldn't find one to actually see and squeeze."
2,Disappointed.,"I just received this pillow, and I think it's very uncomfortable. It's just too thick, so my head is propped up too far (I sleep on my back and side), which hurts my neck. I bought it because of all the positive reviews, so I thought I should add my experience to caution others. I might be able to use it behind my back for reading in bed or watching TV, but not for sleeping!"
4,My head in the clouds,"It's an awesome pillow to sleep on your back. Bought it for over a month now, I like the pleasant smell of what seems to be of milky vanilla instead of the factory smell you wash out. Its my first Latex Foam pillow, all-n-all a great product to fend off the bar scene/night life away from my apartment, when needed. Love that springy feeling to squish on. Might wanna put a firm pillow underneath if you want to sleep on your sides to keep the head leveled. Hope this helps."
1,Not at all what I expected,"This pillow was a disappointment. It's advertised as 'firm,' but it's not. It's like sleeping on mush. There's no support at all. Don't buy this if you are looking for a firm pillow."
2,too hard,"The label inside didn't show made by Talalay latex or dunlop latex as description, only written rubber latex foam. And it was produced by other authorized factory.I feel the queen size is to big and too hard for me. I'm 159cm tall, 48kg weight."
3,too thick for back sleeper,It is bouncy and supportive. But it is too thick for back sleeping. It is better for side sleeper.
2,Product has changed,The pillow is firmer than it was the first time I purchased it about 4-5 years ago. I liked it much better when it was a little softer.
2,What a disappointment....,"I shopped for REAL latex...I shopped for FIRM....this is advertised as REAL latex and advertised as Firm!!!! If it is real latex, it's inferior quality and it is NOT firm by any means. I wanted 2 pillows and only purchased 1 as I was skeptical...darned good thing!!"
3,Prompt delivery,"The pillow arrived quickly. It wasn't firm enough for my liking. I gave it to my teenage daughter, and she likes it."
4,Great Leica Book for any level,"Of the many books written on the subject, this is one of the best books written on the Leica M system. Simple to read, a lot of material is covered on the selection, use and pros/cons of the M system. Beautiful photography that showcases the quality of the system is reason alone to buy it. If you have to buy only one Leica M systems book, this is the one!"
2,Inaccurate,Very poor accuracy after several months of use...I am getting really worthless readings now. BP readings are too important to rely on a unit like this.
4,reliable,Arm cuufs are cumbersome at best and most are impossible to use.I had an Omron wrist model for that reason but it went south and the model is unavailable.The HEM-773AC is the next best thing and has features I need such as a memory.Glad I made the purchase.
3,Interesting and Informative,"A nice coffee-table book with gorgeous photographs of classic movie posters. The text gives succinct information about the movies advertised and the value of some of the posters profiled. Also, a run-down of classic film-noir stars is included."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"If you don't believe anyone else's review here, please believe me when I say this album is truly amazing. I first heard of Kevin Gilbert after his death, thanks to the World Cafe on PRI from WXPN in Philadelphia and I am ever so grateful. The music and lyrics are disarming and beautiful, raw and uncomfortable at times but they really strike home. This is the way people are supposed to be allowed to express themselves through music."
2,American Government roots,I am intresting on buying book but it would really help if I can see if it's the right book. I dont want to buy without picture of book.
3,Good in Periodization bad in routine design,"This book explains very clearly how periodization works, allows to plan up to a year ahead, but only uses three examples (Strenght/Power, Basketball and general fitness). It uses routines extracted from somewhere and explains very loosely how periodization applies to them. You must have some knowledge about how to make a training routine, or this book will be useless.The reason I gave three stars is because the book limits to explain a routine variation based on intensity and volume, leaving up to you the creation of your routines; its examples are very limited.If your interest is in bodybuilding you will read almost half of the book, wondering where were left the routines.If this is your first buy, look somewhere else, you can find (without periodization) better first buys out there."
2,Falls Short,"I was disappointed in this book. It advertises itself as containing ""The Ultimate Training System,"" but does not live up to the title. It has some good material in it, and I appreciated the science-based support of the authors' theories. However, it is extremely light on practical examples. There are far better books out there to help you understand and develop ""The Ultimate Training System."" One I would recommend is The New Power Program: Protocols for Maximum Strength by Michael, Dr. Colgan."
3,Kids enjoy it,I was surprised how short the video was. Being that Sheamus is my son favorite I expected at least an hours worth of footage. I wasn't impressed but my 2 year old won't let it rest.
3,Sowing Good Seeds : The Northwest Suffrage Campaigns of Susa,This book relays the Story of Susan B. Anthony with great detail. I was amazed with the history of Susan B. Anthony and her battle. The author includes actual newspaper quotes from the time of Susan B. Anthony. I would recommend this book as a research tool for the life of Susan B. Anthony.
3,SO SO COULD HAVE EXPLORED MORE OF THE MYSTERIES,This piece covers some of the basics but not all the mysteries I would have liked to have seen more explored. For instance what about the idea that the Sphinx was built before the Egyptians even knew how to build? There were several other mysteries they didn't touch upon so this was just a so so experience for me. OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: September 2011 (streamed).
5,Such a fun series!,"It was great to come to the conclusion of this journey. My 6 year old son loved the books, and so did I! It was appropriately suspensful, but not too scary for my sensitive son. Each character has their distinct personality, which made it fun to read aloud. I'm glad there are a few more Akiko books before we have to say goodbye!"
1,Needed Work,"This book could have been a good read, if the author would have maybe taken a little more time for us to get to know the main character. The title, I found after reading the book, meant nothing to the story, I will not easily pick up another book by this author."
3,"A suspenseful beginning, but finally a bit of a letdown.","This book begins well, and the characters are well fleshed out. By the end of the book, entropy has set in. Nevertheless, the suspense is well sustained, and Lewis has created an exceptionally venal and sociopathic villain. Worth a read, but not a knock-your-socks off experience."
1,Unable To Finish,"I tried very hard to finish reading this book, but after three months I've come to the realization that I've finally found a book I just can't stomach. I found nothing of value, interest, or purpose. The only part I enjoyed was the moment when I threw it down the garbage bin. I found the overall story completely unbelievable, stupid, and insulting. The characters are one- dimensional, and the writing is just plain awful. The neat transparent cover and reviews influenced my decision in buying this book. Never again."
5,All I know is I'm up WAY past my bedtime to finish this!!,"Good for Pam Lewis. I was hooked. I went to prep school, knew skeevy, evil prepsters like Eddie. The characters came to life for me. I'll be interested to now read these other books people are mentioning: Donna Tart, et al. Anyway, I flew thru this book, which is rare for me. My fiancee has been complaining of missing me since I bought the book the other day. That says it all I guess."
2,disappointing,"With an explosive first few scenes, I expected more from this book. Instead, I dragged myself through the rest of the book and forced myself to finish it. The characters are so stereotypical (her excuse is that the setting is the 60s and 70s) and the main character, Carole, is outright stupid. She is so clueless and gullible through the entire book. Even at the end, after the 'shocking climax', she is still a total loser. The story plods along with lots of flashback scenes and things told from a 'thinking back' perspective. That can work most of the time, but when paired with these unintelligent people it makes the entire thing a train wreck.This book proves to me once again that you can't believe all the reviews and publicity. Some people may like it, but a lot of people won't."
2,Be carefull!!!,i purchased these for my dually truck...they installed easily and worked well....then i went for a 100 mile drive. i pulled off the road when truck was driving sloppy (slide in camper was in the bed)...i found both my outer rear tires flat. the connector had spun loose just a little which allowed the air to leak out....they are now un-installed
5,Full House,I have read this book and i thinkt hat it is really cool the way the author writes it. All that i want to know is just two things and they are Can I get a copy of the book via email and is it true that stephanie and her bunch exist? That is all for now I will always buy the book and this the a great story. =
2,Replacement Filter,We are disappointed to discover that this Delonghi replacement filter is not exactly the same as the closely pleated air filter as the one that originally came with the air purifier.
4,Second year still great,We were haveing trouble keeping our clorine level up in the Texas sun. Adding this little beauty solved the problem! I purchase the tablets at Walmart or Lowe's and just keep it in the pool when we are not swimming.This is the second year we have had this and it has held up well.
5,Recommended,"I've had mine for years. Durable, works fine, convenient and easy to use. I've used 1"" and 3"" tablets with equal success. What more is there to say?"
1,didn't work,"This cable not only doesn't have a hotsync button, but won't hotsync with the software either. Maybe it's an incompatibility with my 700p, but I wouldn't recommend this if you have a 700."
2,Power cord for Palm handheld devices,"This power cord was a great buy, at just over $10 including shipping. However the product description did not indicate that the cord does not have a hot sync button, which is necessary for a LiveDrive handheld device. I was not able to use this cord."
1,Cable not as advertised,The cable I received is only a sync cable. It does not have the charging pins and access to insert a charger. I'm very disappointed with this product because it is useless for the charging mode. This looked like the OEM cable I lost. I was using the OEM cable to plug my charger in because my Treo would not charge with the charger plugged directly into the phone
1,Not as advertised,"I received a Palm Treo cell phone since I enjoy tinkering with all sorts of gadgets, but the phone did not come with a charger. I ordered this thinking that I would have a cable to charge and to push the data, but the cable I received was the sync only cable. Check the connections pictured and message the seller before purchasing. I also reviewed some comments left by other purchasers, and they aren't even consistently sending the same kind of cable. DO NOT BUY!"
4,Not your typical Latin novelty book,"More than just your typical ""how to curse in Latin"" book, this offers actual insults and abuses spoken/written by the ancients themselves, as well as cool illustrations. WIN. If you want something similar (and longer, but without the illustrations, alas) try Philip Matyczak'sThe Classical Compendium: A Miscellany of Scandalous Gossip, Bawdy Jokes, Peculiar Facts, and Bad Behavior from the Ancient Greeks and Romans."
4,"Very, very good celebrity autobiography","If you like reading celebrity autobiographies, and you even have a passing interest in this actress, don't miss this book. It really is a very engrossing read. She speaks of her life in a very honest and forthcoming fashion, and she has had quite an interesting life, the most dramatic part being the blacklisting of her actor husband, Larry Parks, in the 1950's, and her ""guilt by association.""Also, if you happen to be a fan of either Lloyd, Beau, and/or Jeff Bridges, you should know that Betty and Larry are/were(Larry is deceased) very close to this family -- Betty is Jeff Bridges' godmother.So, if you know Betty from her movie work (she tells such a funny story about Frank Sinatra, from when they were filming ""On the Town""), her stage work, or her TV work on ""All in the Family"" and ""Laverne and Shirley,"" I think you will more than appreciate this book.I hope you read this and enjoy it as much as I did!"
5,Can't stop watching it!,"This is a great concert by an exceptional band. I love these guys, and I'm sure that's making my review a bit bias.Porcupine Tree is not the band for people that like a ""stage show"" (guys running all over the stage, crazy lights, etc.). They are a band for people that like the music. This delivers that in a big way.I would have liked to have all the concert footage on one disc (the two bonus songs are great). That's my only complaint."
4,Great stuff,After enjoying their music for a while I was glad to watch them do their thing. They are very talented and at the same time bring their talent to you in a relaxed way. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is because I didn't really care for the theme of the editing with changing back and forth from black and white to color and the effects of old film. I guess it has its purpose but not for me. I think it is well worth the price to get to sit back and watch these masters from your easy chair.
2,"bad sewing, not worth it","The only redeeming quality in this item is it's really cheap. But even so, I feel like I could do a much better sewing job and make myself a much better pair of fishnet glovelettes if I'd bought the raw materials myself. The hemming was awful. I had to sew up a few mis-hemmed places myself. And I have petite hands, so they don't fit me very well. Overall a product that one should not bother to purchase."
5,"A John Grisham-like book, only with railroaders instead of lawyers","Absolutely entertaining!! So many twists throughout the book keeps you in suspense the entire journey. Hard to believe this is a first novel for Mr. Parton. Why he was fired for writing this should be more of a mystery than the book itself, unless, of course, some feel they are as ruthless as the fictional characters illustrated in the novel. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially those with any railroad background. I anticipate more books from Mr. Parton and look forward to seeing ""END OF THE LINE"" in the movie theaters. Congratulations on a job very well done!!!"
2,DVD Skips frequently,About 1/2 way through the DVD - it starts skipping both in video and audio (disrupted the overall presentation of the material.---- just didn't bother to return... overall the subject matter was presented well.
5,Excelente precio.,"Por el precio que pague, muy buen reloj, lo mismo que dicen por ahi, la manilla empieza a mancharse pero dichas manchas no se ven cuando el reloj esta puesto, recomendable, es muy bonito.Saludos"
4,Solid Series Rebound,"The third of the Charlie Resnick procedurals, this one brings the quality back up after the somewhat disappointing Rough Treatment. This may be because the stakes are raised back to the level of the first book Lonely Hearts. In this one, someone is slicing up hospital workers, and the motivation is a rather interesting one. There's also a side plot involving a man who won't take no for an answer. There's the usual business with some delving into the messed-up private lives of the police, Charlie takes in a wino jazz saxophonist, and has his ex-wife turn up again. Whets the appetite for Off Minor."
3,OK for $20,"There is a reason that this knife from a fancy German company only costs $20. It is not as substantial as the $40 version. The knife is good and does the job, but with with my previous experience with the brand, I was expecting more."
3,nailer,"Worked great at first, now only drives nail part way in(leaves about 1/2"" sticking out) I've oil it as instructed and it still went bad."
2,Not much,"This CD has about 15 minutes of video explaining some basic principles--that was useful. Plus it has demonstrations of movements taken from Yang-style and Chen-style forms. Other than that, the only content is brief text with the usual advice (like ""wear loose clothing). Disappointing!"
1,get wrong item,"It should be the ""Maintenance Supervisor of CAR EQUIPMENT ""book. I return this item to the seller but still didn't get my money back..."
5,"A cross between Jane Eyre, War and Peace, and Rebecca","I loved this book! I found it two years ago on an obscure back shelf at the local library during the summer, when I was looking for a good book to read. I brought it home after reading the dust jacket, and the first time I read it I was completely engrossed. I couldn't put it down and read the whole 500-something page book in one sitting. I have since gone on to read the other two books in the Kirov Trilogy, but I would have to say that Anna is by far my favorite. For me Cynthia Harrod-Eagles does a wonderful job at bringing the characters to life, weaving their personal struggles with the historical events of the time. As much as I love this book, I would never call Anna a literary masterpiece. Anna is the type of book that you read for pleasure, for the experience that the story gives you, and I must say that the experience is most definitely pleasurable."
2,Package missing parts,"The ball did not include plugs to keep the air from escaping. I spent 30 minutes pumping it up with the manual pump, only to find that there was no way to plug it up. There were also no instructions included on pumping the ball up. (That would've been helpful to know if I was doing it incorrectly b/c of the missing plugs.) Other than that, the quality of the ball was exceptional - very thick and sturdy."
3,bronze batman!!! (NOT!!),"cool! and it's bronze!!! NO! people, bring back the days of BLACK batmen, classic batmobiles, and classic robins. we've fallen into this ""CoLoR"" trap,and we need to get out. do not support this toy. as for the toy itself, from what i've experienced, not bad overall, withOUT the paint."
4,Basic--Good faith builder,"I am writing this review through a verbal transcribing on behalf of my wife:Heald does a good job for someone new to the faith. I found it too basic.The last three chapters would benefit all levels of knowledge: helping to keep faith strong; well written stories.""Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith."""
1,not so,"Johnny One Note Kater keeps on going with new books on his single theme. I suggest checking [...] or the various CDs Tanzdielen und Vergnuegungspalaeste...seems the Germans enjoyed swing and jazz unrestricted throughout the war, big bands and small played swing and jazz in every big city, including Paris during German occupation and including to/for the German military, and that form of pop music was routinely broadcast (and new recordings made) especially for the troops almost throughout the war. Swing dancing was eventually abandoned as a gesture of respect to the dead and wounded on the Ostfront, and nightclubs and their bands kept having to move or shut down due to the bombings. Also, it seems that the 'Verbotenby the evilNazis' line was just a post-war invention of a British record company, with a good stock of German pre-war and wartime jazz and swing records, as a marketing gimmick--oooh, forbidden underground jazz, buy it now."
1,parts hardly fit,"I am in the business of cleaning vacation rentals, so this is not the first vacuum I bought for a customer, who wanted something in this price range. But I regret this purchase. The biggest problem is that the dirt canister and the top it's supposed to lock into, hardly fit together, I always have to somehow pry them together, and just wait for something to break. The other problem is that emptying the canister is always messy, because hairs etc stick to the filter, and the filter looks yucky after just one vacuuming. Unfortunately amazon did not carry the bagless Bissel in this price range anymore, which has a foam rubber ring around the filter, that can be removed and washed. This was the last Dirt Devil I bought."
2,not so great,"Bought this vacuum a year ago and died almost to the day! First off it is very loud!! The attachments are fine but the suction is weak. It did not survive a my home! I have long hair and love to clean house. Had many issues with hair getting stuck in the rollers and in the tools. At around the year mark it just stopped suctioning on the main unit and started to spit stuff back out. I say if you are a light cleaner with a small home and have short hair it may work for you, otherwise no go!"
5,Best vacuum I've ever owned,"My roommate has a dog and we live in a fully carpeted apartment. This vacuum will just keep pulling hair out of the carpet until it feels fluffy and new. The first time I used it, I went over the carpet FOUR times. The only reason I started all over was because the vacuum pulled up SO much stuff that the old one missed, that I had to clean out the container (four times!!)."
5,What a bang for your buck!,"Right out the box I fell in love with this little powerhouse. I have multiple pets so fur is a major problem in my house. My old Bissell just wasn't getting the job done anymore so I knew it was time to put it to rest. I'm so glad I listened to the other positive reviews because they are spot on. Yes, it's noisy but man, it got up fur and dust I didn't even know was there. The only negative is that the cord is a little short for my liking, but nothing I can't deal with.Bottom line, if you want a solid vacuum that will get the job done without spending a lot of money...this is IT."
2,You get what you pay for,"This product was a regretful purchase. I assembled it which 100% all plastic with 4 screws. Turned it on and it is easily the loudest vacuum i have ever heard. The brushhead struggled to work or sometimes didn't work and it certainly wasnt from difficult carpet. I have short well worn carpet. I have to vacuum as if I am vacuuming under tables the whole time to take the little weight there is, off the brushhead so it spins. I will use it until it breaks and get another, better vacuum"
4,Really an devil for dirt,This Dirt Devil works great. It is far better eureka brand which i used for almost 2 yrs. Its light in weight and the paper filter is easy to clean. the only problem with this product is it makes loud noise when it is turned on. despite this it sucks the dirt so fast.
1,practical and functional,"Breeze vacuum was easy to assemble. Our maintenance crew uses one, so I bought one for the house. We have two shedding pets, vacuum works well on the hair. It is light, attachments stay in place, it seems very nice. I've had very expensive cleaners that do not meet this Breeze's performance, lite weight, ease of emptying."
2,It is not what I thought it would be,The parts do not fit and I cannot use it. I am very disappointed. It is sitting in my closet not being used. Can't get the removable part in the center of the vacuum to stay put. It keeps falling out. Not happy at all
2,noisy and dusty,"It has strong power and good suction, but dust comes out after vacuum,which makes me feel that I am messing up not cleaning. The price is pretty cheap but it's not worth."
4,Dirt Devil Breeze,"This vacuum was well worth the money. It's relatively lightweight, it's got great suction and very easy to use. And, it doesn't hurt that it's cute!"
5,mark,this vacuum it great for the price i use it allover my house and it duz a great job and it picks everything up very well
1,Heavy and overpriced,This vacuum was such a huge let down. It's extremely heavy when you are trying to vacuum staircases and it hardly picks up anything! I have a vacuum I purchased for $25 that works ten times better!! Do not waste your money.
1,STOP! Not the One....,"This Dirt Devil Breeze M088160RED, is horrible....breeze is right, front exhaust will blow your cloth coverings OFF! The automatic floor adjustment is YOU lifting the vacuum up for rugs and down for bare floors....The back and forth vacuuming resistance kills my back. So much for the Light Weight claim in the specs. Used it twice and unfortunately threw away the box...have to find out the return policy. Horrible, Just horrible...shame on you Dirt Devil."
4,Great Little Sucker...,"This little vacuum cleaner is cheap, lightweight and has an incredible amount of suction. We thought we were reasonably clean people until we vacuumed our ""already-clean"" carpet with this little machine. The canister began filling up and we were amazed at the amount of dirt, dust and pet hair it removed from the rugs that we hadn't realized were there. Works great on hard surface floors and very easy to push around (even for someone with a torn rotator cuff). Be sure to take the canister and filter outside for cleaning since it can be a bit messy to empty the canister and shake the dust out of the filter. The only complaint is the one mentioned by several other reviewers - the air vent actually does blow directly out the front of the machine, but it's not really a problem if the handle is at a slight angle, which it mostly will be when you are vacuuming. For the money, you won't find a better vacuum cleaner."
1,Piece of total crap!!!,"This vacuum worked ok for about a month, although the hose never really worked the suction is equivalent to picking up a straw and sucking through it. After a month the vaccuum started picking up less and less. Now it actually started blowing debris back out of it and I have had to throw it away. Granted it only cost me $40, but that is really $40/a month if that's all it last for. I can't believe these other 5 start reviews I am reading. This vaccuum is CRAP!!!!"
1,Worst vacuum I have ever had,"I have a very easy to clean apartment- 500 square feet and only two adults living here. All I need is a standard vacuum. This one sucks. It does not pick up ANYTHING. It just spreads whatever is there around the carpet so I have a bigger mess to clean up. After trying to vacuum the floor several times, I gave up and spot vacuumed with a dust buster. Absolutely worthless."
4,Good Overall,"This does a pretty good job, but it's hard to clean the filter & the canister is sometimes difficult to remove."
2,Length is too short...,"I love the color of these tights (I got the Indigo/Purple tights). I really wanted to like them, because they look great, but I had to send them back because they don't even cover my whole ankle. I am 5'4"" and I could not believe that these tights were too short on me. (I am not that picky either, this is the first time I have ever returned anything I bought on the internet.)Instead of these tights, I highly recommend the Adidas Response Boot Cut tights (with the 3 strips down the side). These are very comfortable (and I had to get them shortened, so they are plenty long). Also, if you want a comfortable pair of form fitting (rather than boot cut) running tights, I recommend the Under Armour tights."
3,Misprinted pages 127-174,"It is relatively comprehensive, as much as one would expect from an Italian to English dictionary; however, pages 127 through 174 are printed a full inch above the rest of the book cutting the page numbers and reference words off at the top of the page. Was disappointed although the book is still functional, the benefit of having the quick reference words for those pages is gone."
4,quite good,"The dictionary is quite good--very detailed, with lots of examples. My only complaint, a big one, is that the print is quite small."
1,Unit Didn't Last; Replacement Parts Prohibitive,"Bought one, transported it overseas for installation. Started out working OK, operating parameters of my water supply consistently within Morton's design specs, and output water fine. I was a happy camper for the month it lasted. Then something broke inside. Sprayed water everywhere. Ruined electronics. Found only one supplier of spare parts, with exorbitant pricing. The handful of spare parts I needed almost total the cost of a new replacement unit. Although the unit would be under warranty in the USA, I have no such recourse. I'm considering buying an equal replacement unit, keeping my fingers crossed, and using the defunct month used unit for usable spare parts."
1,A waste of money and time,"I got this from my husband for my birthday, mainly for the purpose of listening to digital audio books. I wasted many hours trying to download audio files, and then trying to get them to play properly. The files would simply stop playing, and finally the unit began freezing up completely. I ended up with a Samsung YP-K3Samsung YP-K3JQG K3 2 GB Slim Portable Media Player (Green)and am very happy with it. Downloading files is quick and easy, recharging is easy, and playback is great. Whatever you do, don't buy this MP3 player."
3,"Great action, Poor Plot","This anime was great action but not for kids due to strong language and violence. For adults, it's great if all you want to see is action, not acting. As a huge fan of anime, I was dissappointed with the fact that the film had no plot other than a hero had to save the world, WOW, how unoriginal!"
4,"A Quirky, but Enjoyable Series","I enjoyed this book so much that I ended up buying the rest of the series. The family in this series was, as most families are, made up of individuals that are more complex on the inside than you first see on the surface. Each main character in the books, has a flaw or weakness that holds them back and as the story unfolds, that flaw is dealt with and they find happiness with their future partner.I particularly enjoyed 'The Daddy Quest', when you see a small child, searching for a home where he can truely belong, without risk of being discarded yet again.If you like books with a positive outcome, you'll like the books of this series."
2,Faulty device.,"I received a faulty device.Giving it 2 stars due to the fact that the sellerpromptly proceeded to reimburse my purchase, no questions asked."
5,Disturbing yet Alluring,"A beautiful farm girl becomes an SS guard at a notorious concentration camp. Her brutality included choosing who would go to the gas chamber, beatings, whippings, and perverted, bi-sexual pleasures. Hung at the age of 22, she proclaimed her innocence to the end saying she was only carrying out orders of her superiors."
3,BLUE ANT HEADSET,"THIS HEADSET IS SMALL WHICH IS REALLY NICE, THE OTHER GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE HOOK OVER YOUR EAR BUT THE DOWNSIDE IS IT DISCONNECTS OFTEN. YOU GO TO ANSWER A CALL AND IT IS DISCONNTED. MAYBE I HAVEN'T FIGURED IT ALL OUT YET BUT SO FAR IT IS NOT THAT GOOD."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this one for my wife when her Plantronics earpiece broke. After using the BlueAnt for a couple of weeks, she went back to the old one, sans the earpiece. Her main complaint was it didn't fit her ear properly, my main complaint was it sounded garbled, like she was talking from a drum. Another problem is the charging system. They tell you not over-charge it - remove it after the red light goes out, around two hours. Who has time to sit around and watch for the red light to go out? I want to plug it in overnight and be ready to go the next morning.Another complaint about both units is the noise it makes from the slightest wind, including the air conditioning in the car. Does anyone make a unit that doesn't do this?"
2,"Small and lightweight, but really cheap quality","On paper this product seemed like the solution for using with skype on my macbook pro. It can be charged on USB, good range, and small enough you even forget you're using it.But when it arrived the sound quality was awful, and from time to time (more often than I'd like to) there's bluetooth problem with the mic that only gets solved if I restart my computer. I contacted Blue Ant about this and they say I have to download a bluetooth upgrade from apple, when in fact I'm using the latest driver available. The mic sensitivity is low, and the construction quality is cheap.The battery duration is good though.If I could go back I'd try another more expensive product... which is probably what I will end up doing."
3,An okay and budget item.,"This thing is OK for the people who wants to try how amazing and convenient bluetooth is. This is OK, if you want to just use it for an emergency. This item is not good for long term using, it's uncomfortable, and unstable as time goes by. But with this price, it's an OK item.Recommend to people who has twenty bucks to waste and who wants to try new stuff."
1,Not reliable,"Not reliable and kept on syncing and unsyncing. People sounded like they were in wind tunnel and my contacts said they could barely hear me. I returned it for a refund. Stick with Jabra BT500...it's big and ugly, but it works great!"
4,great for multiple devices,"Pluses:Can switch between three devices on the flyGood amount of talk time. 6 hours by my countUsually good sound quality. Have some static but I have a Treo 650 which is bluetooth 1.1.Automatically connects to Treo while dialing, I don't have to press any buttons on the X3 to connect it during call.Reasonably priced.Connects easily with my notebook for Skype.Minuses:Headset does not fit securely in my ear without earhook. Without earhook it slowly dislodges from my ear while walkingAnswering a phone call with the X3 is hit or miss. I will press the answer button and sometimes it is slow to connect. It will go to voicemail before the connection is established. Though, when I answer the phone from my treo it will connect to the headset automatically.Only can connect to three bluetooth devices. I have five."
3,"Good sound quality, but poor fit.","I recently purchased the X3 and can say the sound quality is excellent. It was very easy to pair. The control buttons are a good size. Excellent volume. I also like the feature of being able to shut off the blinking light. My only complaint and it is not a minor one, is the fit. If you have small ear canals,it does not fit well. I recommend trying the fit before you purchase it, or buy from a place you can return it."
4,"Very Durable, Simple to switch between phones","This is my second BlueAnt X3. I had to replace the first one due to loosing it ""somewhere"".I find the sound quality, in bound and out bound to be very good. Since I carry a work phone and personal phone, and Maryland is a ""hands-free"" state. I was using two bluetooth headsets at one time. I kinda looked like a SciFi project.I have to admit that if you have ""fat fingers"" changing between devices could be tricky, but I have had no problems. Like all things, it gets easier with practice. I highly recommend this for people with more than one cell phone.**note: I lost my first one sometime in the spring of 2010. Of course after I replaced it in November 2010 (didn't like the SciFi look) I found the 1st one. It was in my yard all that time in the rain, stepped on and mowed over. After all that and a good cleaning it was still working!"
5,Excellent Both in Quality and Design!,"I am having both the Jabra BT500 and BT135. Very satisfy with their voice quality. However, what I brought for my girl friend is the BlueAnt X3. Its cute design caught my attention. My girl friend loves it so much that she never answer her phone without it. She said it's easy to set on her ear and very comfortable. We both satisfy with its voice quality as well. I'll highly recommend to anyone who is looking for one."
3,Good but not great,"I thought this would be a nice economical blue-tooth ear piece for my phone. It works and mine has continued to keep a nice charge but the sound quality is somewhat poor. One day I had a full signal on my phone so I decided to re-record my office voice-mail message for my callers. I left a message and when I previewed it, the sound was awful. That's when I realized what people were talking about when they told me that my phone was difficult to hear me on."
3,Charge anywhere! Quality ok.,The charging options are great! I get alot of static and poor sound quality sometimes even if my head is just turned away from where the direction of my phone is. I would not buy this product again.
3,It's o.k.,I thought I would be able to walk around the office or house with this earpiece however if there is a wall or small object blocking between the phone and the earpiece it will beep or hang up because you are out of reach. It says it can go up to 10ft but I think it's more like 2ft or 3ft. That is the only issue I have with the earpiece.
2,very very short range,"This headset lost signal when I covered it with my hands while the phone was lying on the desk.When the phone was in my pocket, it also made a lot of static by just turning the head .I like the style and features, but I was very disappointed on the range of this headset.I wish it works without static even just two feet away.I wouldn't use this for business conversations."
3,Decent Headset,I used the headset for about 2 weeks and went back to my Ericcson that is also average. I would probably still be using the headset if it weren't for the earhook loosening up and now the earpiece just falls off my ear. I think it might have gotten too hot staying in the truck and the rubber gave way. It's basically unusable now unless I want to hold it to my ear and that kinda defeats the purpose. I don't want to hassle with returning or calling customer service. I don't have patience for that.pros:1. I like being able to charge via USB and it comes with home and car or via laptop chargers making that a big plus.2. Pairing was a breeze3. Seemed clear for the person I was talking to.4. Plenty of attachments and charging addonsCon:1. Earloop loosened and made the device unusable.2. Funky neckstrap3. Earbud pops off too easy. Got lucky I thought I lost it4. Volume wasn't loud enough for me. I found myself pushing it into my ear to hear clearly.
5,Inspirational DIY Stop-Motion,"For young animators just getting started, this collection is a must-see. Ray Harryhausen, whose feature film effects work (i.e. Clash of the Titans) is known and studied by all types of animators, also has a slate of early work that is equally inspiring. These short films, based on well-known fairy tales like ""Little Miss Muffet,"" were made simply with low budgets, using in-camera effects. One of the signature methods Ray used was in-camera dissolves (fading one image out while fading another image in), for changes of facial expression on replacement sculpted heads. The puppets were carefully crafted by the whole Harryhausen family--dad made the armatures, mom made the costumes. While Ray eventually had the opportunity to learn from stop-motion master Willis O'Brien, these early independent films are where he developed his own style and innovations through experimentation. As such they are an invaluable resource as inspiration to stop-motion animators today."
4,With an open mind,"This book is for all of us who have ever wondered if it is possible to contact others from beyond. The research is a great starting point for beginners to open their minds and leap into a a great hobby! Dowzing does not have to be part of your research, Patti gives alternative methods of research such as using a simple tape recorder. Grab this book and head for the nearest cementery. Open your mind and have some fun."
1,this is a piece of junk,"I got this piece of junk as a gift from my company on my 15 year anniversary, the picture quality is BAD and the sound is wayyyyy tooo awfulllll. I got so mad at myself for not choosing something else, my 20 year old t.v. has better sound and picture quality than this home theater.I had tried to returned but they don't want it back, so I took this unit to my back yard, then I got my sledge hammer and wow, what a stress relief, I turn this junk into pieces and then to the trash can. that was the best part."
4,I'm happy,"I also remembered Audiovox as a good brand, and I must say that so far, I have not been disappointed. I have had this unit for about 2 weeks and have had none of the troubles that other people mentioned in their reviews. The fan motor is very quiet(can hardly hear it run), it plays more than loud enough for my taste(what was it that other reviewer said about getting old??). Overall I am quite satisfied with this product, a very good product for the money!"
4,"solution for old dog ""mouth""",I have been using this for about a year since it was suggested by a vet tech. My dog is 14 and has a very smelly mouth but is too old for any dental work. This really helps. the only problem is you have to use it daily and it must not taste too good as the dogs dont seem to like it.
4,Hansgrohe handheld shower,Product is quite good and performs as advertised. Only drawback is that the hose is rather stiff and makes using it a little awkward.
3,"Slick look, wish there was a pocket for the charger","This looks sharp- a water resistant neoprene black zipper sleeve holds my laptop snug and matches my black Macbook. My current laptop bag had a 17"" sleeve, which was too roomy, and my Macbook slid around inside the sleeve. Nylon Zipper has an inner lining that protects the laptop from brushing against the teeth of the laptop. This sleeve is handy for carrying around the laptop on its own. Too bad there's no pocket for the charger. Great deal on Amazon, price was a factor in my selection.I would have liked the sleeve to have a black zipper instead of gray for a uniform look. Also, the sleeve is labelled with ""polycarbonate"" and ""Tucano second skin folder"" on the other side, which doesn't show in the image on Amazon."
3,"good fit for MBP 13.3""","This sleeve is a good value for money product. My 13"" MBP fits in perfectly. I like the inner sleeve which kind of keeps MBP fix inside. However, I feel the sleeve has less cushion compared to some other ones available."
4,Great Book With a Great Lesson,This was a great book. The illustrations were very cool and I even enjoyed the story. It provides a great lesson on how you gain so much more by giving and serving one another than by keeping you talents and time all to yourself.
1,"""Watch"" out - low quality makes it disposable","I enjoyed using this product -- until it came time to change the battery. Then I discovered how low quality the materials are in the construction of the watch. It is essentially impossible to change the battery: the soft plastic holding the battery deforms, so it is extremely difficult to open the compartment. The watch repair store wouldn't even try. In desperation, I carved out the plastic well enough to get two-screwdriver leverage to open the battery case, to replace the CR2032 battery. But even worse, then the poor construction prevented the closing of the battery case. So beware: you need to treat this watch as disposable, once the battery wears out!"
3,Plain Jane Programing Book,"I can only feel the the author of this book was just going through the motions when he wrote this. I know programming books arn't supposed to be action thrillers, but this guys book is dull beyond belief. The examples in it are uninspired and boring. This book exposes the risks inherent when ordering something online. The table contents looked good, but the chapters themselves disappoint."
5,AMAZING!!,"Wonderful, Amazing, Fantastic, I LOVE IT!! Such a simple item for such an amazing workout!!"
4,im not sure this is sea monkeys,this product shipped fast!! as soon as i made the sea monkeys grow i notice these werent sea monkeys at all. Because i usaully get seamonkeys every 3 mmonths and when i look at them they were millions of parasites. i actually think it was cool so im happy about it :D
4,almost there,"great album that features the smooth soul of hall and oates. this is thier best album since the late 80's. sure beats the attempts by michael mcdonald. sometimes the album gets a bit like syrup and most of the times the background music sounds very programmed and muzak like. however the vocals are superb, especially covers of al green, the chi-lites and four tops. i especially like the cover of rock steady. better not turn on the a/c aretha. if you our fond of soul sung right buy this and enjoy a great vocal duo. next time guys hire musicians!"
5,Great Music,"The Chieftains don't need a review by me. I need an album by them. And now, with Derek Bell gone, its a little more poignant."
3,eh.,"Changing the battery is annoying. It requires a small screwdriver to get the plate off. Which means it's not easy to do on the field.The fan itself is pretty powerful and it plugs in very nicely to my JT goggles.I found it to bee to loud though. In Airsoft, when your trying to sneek and talk in lower tones, I can't make out what people are saying 10 feet away from me over the buzz. Even tried oiling it but it didn't help."
1,Tough,These cutters are so intricate that it makes it hard to get the flowers off the board to place on your cake or as cookies.
1,Mickey would never shun pluto,"I watched the first one so many times. This one was too much out of character for Disney. Although I thought the animation was going to make this movie, the story lines are too adolescent for the behavior of Disney characters. I do not understand 90% of the movie and I have no idea what they were thinking making such a RIP OFF from real Disney stories. Furthermore, I would not let any child under the age 18 watch this kind of film."
4,Good movie for young children as well as older ones,"My boys are 3 and 5 years old. Most movies are made for slightly older children and my kids lose interest or are confused by the mature themes. This one was good, though. They watched with an 9 year old friend and everyone enjoyed it."
2,was a mistack,did not mean to order kids accidentaly ordered it threw my kindle fire but anyways it played good with ought any interuptions
1,BIG!!! disappointment - rent it if you have to see it.,"This is the worst Disney product ever. It's little more than an animated ""pop-up"" story book. Gone are any vestiges of Micky, Donald and friends that you would automatically expect. They're replaced by animated ""pop-ups"". Who ever dreamed this up needs to be given a ""pink slip"". Disney has reinvented the DVD into an another advertising platform. Rent it at Blockbuster and save $20+ if you have to see it. P"
2,Lost it's legendary 2D nature,"Disney ruined the thing by putting it in 3D. It's depressing. It's not the guy we know. It should be 2dimensional. I don't recommend it. Why buy something that messes up Walt Disney's greatness? I like the 2D cartoons, but this???"
2,At least the stories were good,"I know the 3-D/CGI worshippers will dislike my heresy, but if ever there was a place NOT to use CGI, this is it. Most of these characters have been around for almost 75 years in their hand-drawn form, and that's what made them special. There was no need to re-make our favorites into what looks like plastic McDonald's toys, and these should be stuffed back into the bag (Santa's?). I'm glad I finally found a place to rent a copy rather than buying one, and it's obvious that the rental houses agree with my assessment, as I had to check on Netflix, two Blockbusters, and one Hollywood video before I could find a lone copy at a third Blockbuster. Please Disney, don't fix what ain't broke."
5,One of the Best,I got this movie for Christmas and thought that it was one of the best Disney movies I've seen and would recommend it to anyone who's a big Disney movie fan.
5,Awesome & Funny Mickey & Friends,We just love this DVD! We started by renting it at the library and my kids especially my son (he's 2) never wanted me to return it! My daughter is 5 and she also loves it! This is such a cute Christmas animated movie! Has several short episodes with all the different main characters! My son's favorite character is Mickey Mouse and my daughter loves Goofy so both are pleased when I turn this on cause they both know their favorite character is coming on. I purchased several months ago and we have been watching long before Christmas and they will probably be watching long after Christmas! Definately recommend this one!!!! Nice for chrildren of different ages that love Disney!
3,Good Mag if they Ever Send it To You!,"The magazine is beautiful and the format really user-friendly. The projects challenge the beader. But...if you live overseas, you might have to wait a year (like I have, no exaggeration) or more (like I currently am), to get what you paid for if you make the mistake of ordering a subscription.Save yourself a LOT of hassle and just order back-issues. Way faster (weeks vs. half-years). Trust what it says on this Amazon website, first before considering a subscription. Consider yourself warned.(I'm sad to learn I'm not the only one who has problems with Interweave Press ""customer service"")."
4,Used for class,I used this in an education class to illustrate some of the issuer with teenagers these days and how they are perceived by those around them. It's a great example of how teen pregnancy can affect life.
2,Disapointing,"Oster is one of my favorite kitchen appliances brands, but unfortunately this mixer is below average. Key for any mixer is its speed control, and this one hardly seems to have any. It almost starts at full speed, which implies that more liquid mixtures end up all over the place except your mixing bowl. Conclusion: I do not recommend the purchase of this product."
2,"After 3 replacements, lowest speed is too fast - not safe","The lowest speed is too fast to be operated safely with thick mixtures. Other speeds are marginally faster. I suspect a design flaw that makes it unsafe to operate. It is a powerful mixer with great overall design, but the fact that it cannot mix as slowly as others of the same general type makes it a deal killer."
1,Don't Buy This Mixer !,This mixer was not manufactured correctly. The holes were not drilled properly to accomodate the beaters. I could not get them in. I sent it back unused. Do not buy this Oster 2534.
3,"It works if you like fast, faster, or fastest.","So for 20 something bucks it works fine, seems like it will last a couple of years of medium to light use. There's a few big issues I have with it. There is no low or mix speed on it. Beater speed between 1 and max is only a few rpms. Its really fast, bowl explosion fast. The other item the beater eject, power selector combination really sucks. When you try and turn it on you either eject the beaters or it turns on.I'd buy something else if I'd could do it again."
2,Variation in speed no longer working...Too Fast,"At first I was pleased with this inexpensive mixer, but within a few months I noticed that it no longer had much variation between its low and high speed. The low speed is so fast now that I am unable to mix anything without splattering my counter and walls. It's especially bad when there is flour in the mix. If you don't completely work the flour in by hand you are guaranteed to have it flying all over. Will be buying a different mixer today. It's too bad it had this problem because I did appreciate the retractable cord, weight of the product and the ease with which the beaters were put in and out."
2,Has 2 speeds: fast and faster,This beater has only 2 speeds: fast and faster. The lowest speed is too fast and it makes the flour fly all over the place. I am sorry I bought this one. It is difficult to remove the blades since there is no blade release button: you must have to pull them out of there roughly. It is also very noisy and scares the animals and small children.
1,"Stiff speed control, no low speed","The 6 attachments (2 beaters, 1 whisk, 2 dough hooks, 1 drink mixer) are a big plus. However, speed #1 is too fast. As others have said, it's difficult to control splattering when the speed is too high.Additionally, the speed control doesn't move very smoothly. Moving the control from OFF to 1 requires a lot more ""thumb power"", so much that when the control does move, it goes all the way to 2 or 3. Moving between the other speeds (1 to 6) is easy. Moving from OFF to 1 is not. This makes this mixer even more inconvenient to use as I do not want to start mixing at speeds 2 or 3. My previous hand mixers had speed controls that required only a very light touch to move."
1,Plastic junk,"After one year of light use, the plastic blade receptacles broke rendering this overpriced product useless. Previously, I had found the blades difficult to eject - requiring much thumb pressure - and the mixer blades never seemed to seat with a definitive 'click'. I replaced a perfectly good 25 year old $10 dollar mixer with this product to 'treat' myself. Wish I had my old mixer back!"
2,No speed control,"I have the same complaint as everyone else, the mixer only seems to have one speed, and it is way too powerful. I'm not sure why there are 6 speeds either, as they all seem the same. If you want to beat something thick and heavy, then this might be just the thing. But for whisking an egg with the included attachment, you better get ready to clean the egg off the walls. I can't imagine what would happen if you tried to use the cocktail attachment!I did think it seemed well made otherwise, also liked the retractable cord, but unfortunately the speed problem makes it virtually unusable. That's why I'm on amazon today, looking for a new mixer. Hate that I wasted almost [....]bucks on this."
3,Useful information for professional and hobby gunsmiths,"This book contains a wealth of practical information on basic gunsmithing which will be of benefit primarily to hobby gunsmiths, although there are plenty of ""tips and tricks"" that will also appeal to professionals in this field. A wide variety of topics are covered, including choosing and using basic tools, blueing, trigger jobs, and general maintenance tips for a number of specific firearms. The book production is not of the highest quality, and subsequently the photographs are not as instructive as one might hope. However, the text is straightforward and not weighted down with jargon. Overall, an excellent introduction to an interesting topic."
1,I DO NOT RETRACT MY REVIEW!,"Someone forged a positive review with my name on October 27, claiming to retract my original review. They used an old e-mail address and location and put slanderous words in my mouth! I won't go into the personal details here (but that bogus review had them 100% wrong!). I'll simply say that I stand by my original 1 star review. I am very suspicious of all positive reviews on this page. You should be too. This is a bad book. Don't waste your money here."
2,UGH!,I was so excited to get this book but it was terrible. Almost every meal has tofu recipes......gross! It didnt cost me very much coming from Goodwill which was good because the book wasn't at all what I was looking for.
1,THE WORST BODYBUILDING DIET BOOK,"I wanted to like this book, but it just doesn't work. The whole project feels amateurish, dashed together. But the worst part is the food. I tried several of the recipies and spent most of my time washing them down the garbage disposal. Yech! The science behind the diet advice is also very faulty, sometimes downright dangerous. This is a warning from an unbiased observer: Don't waste your money here."
5,Good for digital cameras,"We bought one of these for our Cybershot to hold our family pictures. It's good quality, stores enough photos for us to be happy, and is compatible with other things (ie. digital photo frames), that allow our things to be shared.No one here owns a PSP so I have no say about how it functions with one of them. Just sharing that it can be used with other SONY products as well."
1,Myst V Crashes - Ubisoft Refuses to Support Mac Customers,"I would like to review this game from the experience of playing it. Unfortunately, there is a KNOWN problem (known to Ubisoft) that causes the game to freeze Mac OS X. I have a fully loaded Mac (2.5 GHz dual processor, Radeon 9600 Pro, 2 GB RAM, etc.) and the game crashes at even the lowest video quality settings. (The first Myst's game graphics were better than what Myst V provides at this setting). Ubisoft refuses to correct the problem... Do some research... search for ""Myst V Crash OS X"" and read all the forums discussing just how much Ubisoft really cares about their Mac customers. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,I have no desire to continue this game.,"I am SO let down by this game. The Ages don't even begin to touch the other Myst games. After just finishing Revelation, EoA seems like it's a rushed attempt to finish an epic series. The game play itself is boring, with very few realistic enviromentals (like butterflies, wind, birds etc). What happened to the interesting creatures we got to meet in the other Myst games? The backdrops themselves are static, and motionless, not typical of a Myst game. The graphics are jumpy if you try and play in any mode but first person and then they're locked on with little maneuverability. This leaves exploration frustrating with the whole ""point and click and no that's not where I wanted to go"". I haven't even found myself wanting to play this game since the second time I tried to get into it. In short end it with Revelation and save yourself the disappointment, and the forty bucks."
4,As I Lay Dying is an intriguing tale of moral intrigue,I thought that the way Faulkner used Jewel as a saving grace for Addie anytime there was trouble was very interesting because she was the one who seemed to have the most to gain by ending their journey to bury Addie in Jefferson. I also thought the ending of the book was very intriguing and very good because it really kept me on the edge and left me thinking about what happened next in the lives of that tragic family.
4,Love this grill!,I love cooking on the grill side and will try the griddle side soon. Only thing is it's a little hard to clean at times but not horrible.
1,Exploding Eggs Every Time,"I used to have a different microwave egg poacher that I really liked; I thought it was a really quick and easy way to get some protein in for breakfast in the morning. Well, I haven't been able to find that one since I moved, so I bought this one from a store (not here on Amazon).I read the directions and followed them exactly, but each and every time, eggs exploded all over my microwave. Who has time to clean egg bits off of every service of the microwave in the AM when the goal is to get breakfast made and get out the door as quickly as possible?I found my original style one, I believe it's made by Nordic Ware, at a different store. I've used it every day this morning with nary an exploded egg, just perfectly done in 1 minute or less every time. Maybe it's the design of the Progressive one that didn't work out for me. Either way, my advice is to spare yourself the money, time, and wasted eggs and get the Nordic Ware one instead."
1,I couldn't make it work,I may be an idiot but I couldn't get this thing to work. I ended up with egg all over the inside of my microwave.
4,Easy to use/Lacks basic features,"I bought this unit primarily because it is simply the eaisiest to program/use. On most combo units, the remote can become quite confusing and hard to read, but this unit shines. If the unit had high speed rewind and the remote could control your TV, 5 stars, no doubt."
1,It doesn't work,"I bought this for my parents for Christmas. It doesn't work at all. The dvd drawer won't open. It won't play a VCR tape. I have yet to find out if Amazon or the ""Close out King"" will replace it or refund my money."
2,Falls short,"The expectation from a Pastor of a church over 15k would be a book on dealing with the myriad of issues in such an environment.This is a soft book, few challenging thoughts/ideas. IF you've read Swindoll, Blanchard, Hayford, Damazio, Maxwell and a plethora of other authors then you'll think you are in familiar territory. Frank Houston, Brian Houston, Kevin Conner and Ivan Herald will challenge you with every word, thought and idea.Their books are not widely available sadly."
5,A Must-Read for Pastors!,"Many younger and older pastors alike have stood in awe at the way God has used Bill Hybels at the Willow Creek Community Church outside of Chicago. Willow is currently the largest church in North America. Hybels is a dynamic speaker and author, in addition to being an extremely successful pastor. Now, he has gathered his leadership thoughts together in this volume, which is sure to be a great help to all Christian leaders.Throughout this book, Hybels emphasizes the importance of possessing a Divine vision for God's people, then pursuing that vision relentlessly and casting it consistently. The author offers various thoughts and insights into what makes a great leader. Many of these lessons he has learned through his own ""school of hard knocks"" at Willow.I recommend this book very highly to all pastors, regardless of church size or denomination. I always enjoy Hybels' writings, and this volume is undoubtedly one of his best. Don't pass on this one!"
4,Don't have to have an advanced degree in leadership to lead,"Bill Hybels continues to show up the myth of academic craze. Do not get me wrong. Academic pursuits are great, but they must not become an end in themselves.In this work, Hybels shares the fruit of his labors in the research and experience of leadership for over two decades. I find this book to be worth the price. I especially like the his interaction with his ministry. A pastor will appreciate that greatly."
2,"Love the stand, Hate the straps.","Length:: 1:30 MinsI have the original adjustable Bowflex 552's with stand purchased @ 2009 and recently bought the 2012 model with stand. The weights have been re-engineered, but the stand is exactly the same including the straps. On the originals, the strap lay perfectly flush with the base while sitting on the stand. The stand on the new model is a bit more squared and raised. They did not however redesign the straps to fit.When I called Bowflex and warned them that this is a recipe for injury and the ensuing lawsuits, they simply said they knew what I was referring to and have not had any complaints. They also said they had no reason to change it unless more people were to complain or injure themselves. I told her it was a backward way of doing business. I also warned her that I would put the facts on youtube."
5,Quick workouts w/ this thing,"Great set. I zip through workouts quickly w/ this set of dumbells. A bit pricey but you get alot for your money. I hope they will last, prior to buying from this site, I checked the set out at a big name sporting goods store w/ the dirty name. The display model was broken from customer use. Not sure if someone mishandled it or it was just from repetitive use but on one setting, one of the plates would not stay attached/engaged w/ the main dumbell.Great pc of excercise equipment."
4,Save your back with this,I got my set of Bowflex SelectTech dumbbell on sale before and thinking to get this stand when it's on sale. I didn't realize it's such a back saver until I got the stand. Very solid build and don't have any problem except the holding area doesn't fit the dumbbell set base perfectly. Maybe it's just my set but since there is a tie down to the dumbbell set I was really worry about it. Free shipping on amazon is great!
4,Weights,Weights are great. The bench that I got with them was a serious pain to build. The mechanism for the weights is also a little tight but will loosen with usage.
4,Great looking shoe,"These shoes are absolutely adorable. I received them quickly from Amazon, even though I did the no rush delivery and I was extremely pleased at how they looked on my son. They are easy to put on and take off, I didn't have to worry about him kicking the shoe off and losing it, and to me they make him look like a little man, so I think these shoes were good for the money spent!"
3,"Cute, but disappointed","I agree with other reviewers who have said these shoes fit their child's foot very well. They are easy to put on and they stay on very well. They are cute and can be worn as either dress up or casual shoes. However, I am disappointed that these shoes have not held up better. My son has worn these shoes for about six weeks and the brown leather is peeling off the top of them. He's worn them mostly indoors and only on dry surfaces outdoors. He rarely crawls in them and does not drag his feet when he walks. I can't figure out why these are showing wear and tear so quickly. Although I am pleased with the way these fit my son I have to say I will not buy pediped shoes in the future. They are too expensive to be wearing out so quickly. Very disappointing!"
3,"Great video, bad sound","I ordered this video to have a good record of the dancing in the Bournonville production. The video quality is just fine, but the sound is off by about half a beat. My guess is that this happened in the translation from PAL to NTSC. It is unfortunate. I even exchanged my original purchase for another in hopes I just had a bad copy, but alas, it is the same issue, so I returned the second as well. It is very distracting in the ""reel"" section of Act I to hear the stomp of feet before you see it! It is then also extremely distracting in all the fast-paced solos that are so musical in nature.However, if you are looking for style pointers from Lis Jeppesen, and want to see an excellent ""Madge"", this is the DVD to purchase. There's nothing much more beautiful than watching Nikolaj Hubbe's batterie....so turn the sound down and enjoy!"
3,"Great film, poor quality tape","This is one of the best ballet films ever made, but this VHS tape contains a very worn-out copy that is in dire need of restoration. I hope eventually someone produces a DVD with a restored version of this great performance."
1,A dissapointment,This book was unfortunately a terrible follow-up to a great series... This is a slow and boring book. I did like the first two books but this book dissapointed me. that is about all I can say ):
1,Don't waste your money.,Very poor summary of NHL's best goalies.Most of the video clips were of the crowd.Don't waste your money on this DVD.
3,Inclusive language taints a really good translation,"I picked up my copy of this version of the Bible used and cheap, figuring I had nothing to lose. As it turns out, I really like the translation. It is compact, easy to read, reasonably accurate (exceptions noted below), fairly literal, and has nice little maps, diagraphs, and charts. The font is readable (unlike micro-Bibles which are all but unreadable). It is fairly bare bones, with few notes - far fewer then the NAB, my other favorite translation - which makes reading a breeze but is less than comprehensive.Now for the bad news. I really hate inclusive language translations, and this one is full of inclusive language, particularly in the Psalms and Proverbs, so I had to do a lot of cross-referencing with other translations. But overall I got more than my money's worth."
1,"Seriously, DONT buy this. It's a waste of time and money","This is a very low budget film based on a Powerpoint presentation and spliced U-Tube videos. The last segment is literally cut from a low rate Jamaican cooking show. If I could, I'd give it zero stars."
1,not as advertized,"This was a sorry guide to help anyone,it showed nothing on the subject. I do not think it could guide anyone to anything."
4,This book may be the best books on communication circuits in the world market,"I think this book is the best for readers to see all the details about how to design practical analog circuit building block inside the latest transceiver in the mobile phones brandname such as Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola etc."
1,Not happy at all,"I orderd this pump on June 1 recieved and installed it on June 10, as of october 22 it has stopped working. The sump is difficult to access and Have not been able to get to the pump due to water levels. The only reason I gave this one star is because you cannot give it no stars.No more Wayne products for me.Update, 1-10-2011. I was finally able to access the pump and remove it from the primary sump location. The pump is totally dead!!! I will be contacting Wayne today and will update the results as soon as I have some form of satisfaction."
5,Great Bass,"I gave this CD to my father for his birthday and he was delighted. Chaliapin was one of the greatest singers of his day, and he brings his fabulous bass voice to these classic Russian folk songs. Of course, it is an older recording, but the quality shines through."
5,Ideas and inspiration,The book is very informative on many matters of reproducing armour using techniques that are centuries old.A must have for any person seeking to start making their own specialised armour for themselves.
2,Average at best,"This is the first book I've read by Joan Johnston. I love similar authors like Sandra Brown and Nora Roberts, so I thought this book would be in the same vein. Instead, there are so many characters and they are jumbled all over the place, so it is very difficult to keep track of who has what relationship to another character, and so on. This is probably a decent ""beach read"" but it's disappointing in many ways. ""The Rivals"" is an average, at best, romantic thriller."
4,good enough for us,"It does the job, though it's pretty loose on the broom handle. I'm happy with it!"
5,Bursting With Life,"To me a good book grabs you like a fist, pulls you in and doesn't let you go. (Okay, some would say a lover's touch, but I have intimacy issues so it's a fist.) This book is that fist. These pages are electrified. I know that sounds incredibly trite, but in this case is true. For a book about a neurotic fear of death, this is an invigorating, life-affirming rush. I'm sure each line was carefully crafted by the author, whom I now worship, but one is utterly unaware of the effort that was involved. Stream-of-consciousness only works if the person who's streaming is intelligent, complex, witty, unusual, thoughtful of the reader and painfully honest. All of which is the case here. Wickedly funny at every turn, Waiting For My Cats To Die will probably be a best-seller. Because when something is as alive as this book, it makes a very loud buzz."
1,its a joke,"i too was amazed $249.00 spark plugs fore only $9.99 that was my price 3 weeks ago, when i got the plugs they were not 6241 platunum they were 3.99 bosch plugs that sell at auto zone for $2.99, when i called i was told that the 6241's have been superseeded with the cheep ones that i got in the mail, trust me i do alot of shoping on amazon and i have never had any problems untill this retailer, dont waste your time IT A JOKE"
4,The Review:,"Detailed, practial and sometimes downright hilarious, this engaging book covers everything from ticket buying strategies and tips on choosing the best seat, to what to do when your traveling companion happens to be a 4 foot bottle of chianti. It's refreshing to read a ""business/travel"" book written with such wit-- I'd like to see more books by this author."
2,Not what I expected,"I should have read the reviews before ordering. I've always purchased Bare Fruit's Cinnamon Apple Chips in the past but I thought I'd try something different for a change. When I ordered the Bananas & Cherries I was hoping they would be crispy and crunchy like the apples, but the texture was completely different. The chewy cherries are OK, but the bananas are really tough to chew. With the apples I'm satisfied with one bag, but with the bananas and cherries it takes two bags. I'm sorry I didn't stick with the apples. I was really disappointed. If I had read the reviews first I probably wouldn't have ordered them. Live and learn."
4,"Nice and sturdy, but not as easy as it may seem.","This is a sturdy bed, and my two-year-old loves it. FInding a store that actually carries it in stock may be a challenge. However, it is somewhat difficult to line up the screw/nut retainers with the metal frame holes. Be patient and assemble it properly. This is a nice bed that makes good economical sense, overall."
2,"Really, really hit and miss.","Guns 'n' Roses pulled off a pretty nice cover version of Nazareth's ""Hair Of The Dog"" because Axl Rose could hit the notes and approximate the attitude and screech of Dan McCafferty's original vocals. Former Iron Maiden frontman Paul Di'Anno just can't pull it off...he can't hit the notes, it's just a huge letdown if you've ever heard the original. Tommy Shaw fron Styx singing Pink Floyd's ""Money?"" EXCUSE ME? Leslie West turning in a half-hearted re-take of his OWN ""Blood Of The Sun?"" SEBASTIAN BACH on Hendrix's ""I Don't Live Today?"" Bad decisions, less-than-stellar performances. Time for Schenker to leave the ""covers band"" schtick behind."
4,designer knitwear,"This is a great read, not exactly what I was looking for though. Would be great as a text book for fashion design course or similar. As I said it is an interresting read but for the hobbist, its a bit too heavey going, it will have to go in my 'one day when I retire and have time' pile. Having said that it is well written and set out but if you are looking for a simpler me user friendly book try [[ASIN:0470068175 Teach Yourself Visually Knitting Design: Working from a Master Pattern to Fashion Your Own Knits (Teach Yourself Visually) which I also purchased and think is much more my style."
3,overall disappointed,This knife is a joy to handle and cuts like a dream as long as it is sharp. There's the problem. I have found that it doesn't hold and edge as it should. Even if I use a steel to align the edge before every use. I would/will purchase another brand of Satoku. Not Wusthof's usual quality.
2,Disappointed,"When this knife arrived, I was excited, but then soon my heart became disappointed when I realized that this is a cheapened version of the Wusthof Classic set. The steel does not go through the entire knife. It cuts OK, but it is not the classic. One has to look very hard in the picture to see the difference. The title of the knife does not tell you that this is the cheaper version."
1,Disappointing Video,"After reading all the great reviews of this video I was excited to receive it. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to expectations. Much of the video centers around the divers. As a wreck diver, I recognized many of the names but the video failed to report any interesting facts about them. The narrator simply repeatedly announced their names as they came on screen. The video actually offers little to no insight into such things as gear configuration or diving techniques as suggested by another reviewer. The underwater videography on the wreck was interesting but was a small part of the video. The bulk of the video was the narrator dryly repeating the same lines over and again."
4,Needed work,"This is an acceptable spatula. however, I did not like the sharp edges and roughness in the slots so I took a very small rounded and a very small flat file and took away the roughness up and down and inside and out. I finished this off with wet or dry sandpaper 500 and 600. Took about 15 minutes. I didn't expect to have to do this as I have already have good Wusthof, Henkels and Sabatier in other type items and the high level items were good as is. Our Wusthof high end knives are great.For this price the inside edges finish should have been a little better and smoother."
3,creeps,"Bashing this movie is simply stupid. Right off the bat you should know that it's a low budget, schlocky B movie. Not really what you would call horror, either. This movie did it's job for me. It entertained me and I bought it for about $3. The story is good enough to keep you interested. Of the 8 member cast, 2 did an alright job. The little blond, altough wasn't a good actress, was OK on the eyes and at times funny. You really think she thinks she's giving an Oscar worthy performance and that's funny to me. One other thing; the little dude who played Dracula, was the best actor in the movie. I thought he did a good job."
4,Primer to the Light: a Spiritual book for Beginners,I found the book to be a wonderful read. I have read it many times and each time I find something different and useful. I think it is a terrific little book to recommend. I hope there will be a second book.
5,Better than expected,"After reading other customer reviews I opted not to purchase the Altitech-2. Then I decided to give it a try and send it back if it didn't work. Mine has worked well--barometer, thermometer--everything! Glad I got it, especially at $97!"
3,Meh.,"After reading all the 5 star reviews claiming that this is the holy grail of keyboards, it hyped me up. But after receiving this keyboard, I was like ""meh"". It's very light, maybe 3-6 oz. Typing is slightly better than the mushy keyboards bundled with desktops. On a scale of 1-10, I give it a ""meh"".And I messed up my review on the seller, Geneva Marketing...and Amazon won't allow me to edit it so I'll write my feedback here.""AMAZING customer service! Steve cares alot about his customers, to my surprise upon opening the box, I was greeted by a friendly note card. I would absolutely do business with Geneva Marketing again.""Note: I am not affiliated in any way with Geneva Marketing, I'm just sharing my love towards them."
4,key board,keyboard is good and letters are large making it easy to use. it could have a larger back space button is my only negative comment.
2,bury my head after listening to this.,"Like many people, I've been a fan of Saosin back in the days when Anthony Green ruled them all. At Anthony's leave, I thought to myself, ""Nooo!"" and when they aquired a new vocalist, he sounded slightly like Anthony, so I was like, ""Maybe this isn't that bad after all.""But readers, I was wrong.Voices was one of the most disappointing albums of the year. I purchased it at $10 at Target, really excited, and after one listen, I was crest-fallen. Why did they remake ""Bury Your Head?"" It's not like anyone really notices it, but there is a pretty big difference.I feel that Saosin has lost their power - it was fully expected from the first EP that they were going to be one of those bands that was just amazing, and now I can't really say a good thing. I feel that they're weaker now in strength, and even the instruments seemed so BAD.The only reason I give them 2 stars is because:1. At least they tried2. I feel sorry for them."
3,good...but not what i expected,this isn't saosin. saosin was with anthony green and beau. now it's only half of saosin. the cd is good but like the previous reviews said it's not GREAT. they spent a lot of time on this but i don't think most of the time was spent recording this but rather trying to stablize their band so i'll give them a break. i'll be looking forward to the next album. just as long as they don't turn into thrice i'll be happy.
2,Big Problem,"Of all the good things on this album, the one bad thing outdoes all of the good.Saosin's two best members or not part of the band anymore.I would like this band if they changed their name.They aren't Saosin without Anthony Green.If they had a differant name I would love this album, but realizing how much better Saosin was with Anthony Green I just can't reccomend this."
5,I love this perfume,This is one of my favorite's even though it is an older perfume. I love this bottle and I got a great price on it.
1,Ps3 AV Cable,"This was really bad. I went to play a game and nothing showed up. I used the one that came with the playstation and it worked fine, but when I used this the picture didn't show. I am really disappointed."
5,A New Latitude,"You only have to listen to the music stylings of Miss Megan Slankard for a few seconds to know that what you are hearing is the result of massive talent and the unleash of creative passion. ""Freaky Little Story"" with it's heart felt ballads and power tunes is the perfect blend for anyone who loves well written soulful music. Providing not only vocals and words but also guitar on the album, Megan proves to the world that she is a force to be rekoned with and a talent that will refuse to be ignored. Purchasing this record, as well as her other album ""Lady Is A Pirate"", will add flare and flame to any cd collection. I have nothing but love and praise for the Megan Slankard Band."
3,Poached Eggs,The Progressive Microwavable egg poacher is much quicker at poaching eggs than the traditional method but it does have it's drawbacks. Plan on a portion of the egg being under cooked and a portion almost hard boiled. Also no matter how many holes you punch in the raw egg there will be some small explosions in the microwave. Still it is usable and the poached egg tastes good. I will continue using it.
1,Like your poached eggs with overcooked yokes & slimy undercooked whites? This is the perfect egg poacher for you.,"What is good about this product is that it's easy to clean & it ruins the eggs quickly. I had a Salton electric egg poacher that lived a long, wonderful life, cooking perfect eggs every time. I've gone through 18 eggs, 2 at a time, following the instructions exactly, next, trying a litte more/less water, little/more cooking time, little more/less power level. Nothing works. If 1 egg is close to edible, the other isn't. I'm going to buy an Egg Genie now."
3,Works well and cleans up nice. Not great for breakfast sandwiches,The reason I bought this was to make eggs for use in a breakfast sandwich. This item cooks the eggs well and allows for easy cleanup. The problem is that the egg is shaped in a way that it is very thick. It works ok for a mini-bagel sandwich but it is really too thick. It looks ridiculous in an english muffin sandwich and is way too small and thick.
1,Micrwave Egg Poacher,"This is a real waste. True, it costs less than $7 delivered, but there is no way to get the yolks runny unless the whites are totally like water. Also the 4 eggs do not cook evenly. Save the money and get something better."
5,Good ball,"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this ball. I'll probably get the next size up just because I like to have a little more surface area to do crunches. I don't know why people complain about the foot pump -- I think it's great and it only took me about 5 minutes to inflate the ball. There were also instructions included in the box on how to inflate the ball. The only thing they forgot to mention was to take the plug out before attempting to inflate it. I guess they include 2 ball plugs and I didn't notice that one was already in the ball (this is my first stability ball). I also like that the ball is made in Taiwan instead of China. I doubt that Taiwan is much of a step up from China, but I just get tired of purchasing products that are made in China. Seems unavoidable these days."
1,Flimsy foot pump,The foot pump is a cheap piece of plastic and the hose doesn't stay in the pump. It was completely useless and so I was unable to pump up the exercise ball. Returned for a refund. Don't bother with the GoFit brand if it has a foot pump!
2,Ball Goes Flat,"The ball is nice; however, it is thin. My cat jumped on it. Put a hole in it. Went flat. Tried to fix it with patching and it did not work. I do not recommend buying this flimsy exercise ball."
5,Great fun!,My whole family loves this ball for fun and exercise. It is firm and large enough for some challenging work. The kids balance on it and try to move forward and backward without touching the floor. The adults use it for backbends and reverse situps. It's great!
3,"Magazine ""Hip-Art"" Meets Maurice Sendak","A clever (albeit formulaic), ""left-handed"" tale about a young girl's focus of concern, My Friend Chicken is a fine debut by a promising artist/writer.While the art is quite interesting and unusual for a children's book, it is a bit of an over-saturated style most commonly found in trade magazines to help jazz up boring articles. The free-style writing and anarchist ""courier"" script goes nicely with the artwork, but I would have liked to have seen a less overall commercial influence for this book - and a more original formula.Regardless my own analysis, this recipe is sure to appeal to the self-proclaimed ""children's book experts"" like a fresh dug worm on hook cast out in the stream! Reel em' in Mr. McCauley!"
4,More Chillers for Young Readers,"This collection of scary stories appeals mostly to the very young reader. Each story is quite short and simple. The typical story has a short build-up with a simple shock ending like ""there was a skeleton at the door."" Stories lack the resolutions older or more accomplished readers will want but for the style they are really rather entertaining.The stories range widely in their focus. The reader meets monsters, vampires, witches, bad fortunes and all manner of scary thing.This is the second in a series. It has also been collected with the first volume (TALES FOR THE MIDNIGHT HOUR) in another book called TALES FOR THE MIDNIGHT HOUR, VOLUME ONE (ISBN 0-7607-6775-0)."
2,not up to date,"This book is written in the old-fashion-style and is not really up-to-date. It would have been switched out 35 years ago if it had been a schoolbook.The cover does not say it only covers early 911's, even though it only covers up to -73.Bengt"
2,"Not horrible, but not good either",This is not a high quality ceramic whetstone. The rough side is way too rough and leaves deep scratches in my blades. I'll add the caveat that I am not a professional knife sharpener but i am following the directions and not getting good results.
5,Madina Licorice Stick Strawberry Flavor,"This is the true licorice. What is interesting is that every licorice product is made with these sticks. The commercial black twisted licorice products we find in grocery store have probably 1 or maybe 2 percent of extract of these raw sticks. These products have no medicinal effects for health. True licorice is very good for stomach issues [specially after eating too much during a party added with liquor] and the result is like magic, better than pharmaceuticals products. I gave it a 5 stars because the product is 100 % natural, well packed and it gives an option for people who try to get this natural product."
4,expensive but worth it!,I have crohns disease and my doctor always suggests being on a strong probiotic. This product helps me from feeling bloated and keeps things moving easily. I notice a big difference when I forget to take it. I tried switching to a cheaper brand but it just didn't cut it.
5,Stand Alone Complex Rocks!,"If you haven't seen SAC then you're missing some of the best anime to come out of Japan since GTS.The soundtrack has most of the riffs and beats from the TV series as well as the opening / closing themes. Yoko Kanno's work is some of the best I've heard from an anime show since her work on Cowboy Bebop, and that was a blast.If you have seen the show, get the soundtrack!"
4,More Latin than African--She has much better work elsewhere,"Tight Latino-Caribbean band deep with polyrhythms and horn charts sharp as a razor. Big alto voice tends to stay in the mix. Uses a wide variety of styles that sound more New World than African, but African roots surface here and there in especially hot rhythms and lighter elements of the upper part of the mix. Not as African as I had expected. Traditional in many ways.To be honest, I was disappointed. The Kidjo I want more of is the one who turned the movie, Lightning in a Bottle, on its head. Her boogied Buddy Guy into an incendiary take on Jimi Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child."" That's the voodoo we want from Kidjo; you won't find it here. [49:47]"
2,confusing and implausible,"This book was fun to read and well written. Lehane creates colorful characters, and makes them seem extremely lifelike. But this book is excessively violent, and the ultimate ""reveal"" is simply not believable. Nor are many of the plot twists along the way. Reading this book is like guzzling a 6 pack of diet soda -- tastes good going down, but leaves you feeling empty and slightly dirty inside."
5,I WANT A BUBBA DOLL!!,Dennis Lehane is becoming my favorite author. He just keeps getting better and better. I hope he never peaks. His characters are alive and full of righteous spark. BUBBA is inspirational....he's my favoRITE.
2,Not up to Lehane's standards,"I agree with ""egregory"" from the reviews below--this novel is not as good as Dennis Lehane's previous ones.""Gone, Baby, Gone"" was brilliant; it surpassed all the cliches of ""hard-boiled"" detective fiction. ""Prayers for Rain"", on the contrary, was full of cliches in dialog, characters, situations, and even plot, which I found easy to predict. It seemed like something written while listening to fast'n'cheap rock'n'roll in a hotel room in New York. I highly recommend all his previous books, so start with them, and only when you feel a drought of Lehane, attempt a 'Prayer for Rain'."
5,Lehane=GREAT!,"Each time time Lehane writes a new book it is better than the ones that came before it -- and keep in mind his first book, A Drink Before The War was VERY GOOD. Prayers For Rain is a book that you won't be able to put down once you start it. In typical Lehane fashion, the plot grabs your attention from page one and never lets up; and the main characters, Patrick and Angie, come across as so real you feel that you are one of their friends (or at least would like to be one). And let's not forget Bubba -- and I don't mean Clinton. Bubba is definitely one of my favorite bad/good guys in fiction, and is someone I'd want on my side if I was ever in major trouble. In Prayers For Rain Lehane provides insights into Bubba's character like never before. Don't miss this book!"
2,"same old, same old","very formulaic. read one you,ve read them all. sloppy writing, e.g. has one character as an army brat who followed his father to a large number of stations including north korea. huh?? uses a disguise for one charcter identical to one used by mankell and chesterton before him. substitutes violence, sadism and sex for creativity."
1,poor design,"This gopher trap is designed poorly. We have gophers and bought this trap online. The only problem is that the part that should come down and trap/kill the gopher gets stuck with the dirt when you set the trap up. I'm not sure if we didn't dig down far enough or what the problem was, but the gopher issue was not solved with this product."
4,Kills moles,"In soft, loose, or sandy ground, the spikes might cause the entire trap to jump up out of the ground when the spring is sprung (every action has an oposite and equal reaction). I drilled two holes in the top of the arms of the trap, then used small string to stake the traps into the ground. Then be sure to spring the trap several times to be sure the spikes drop freely. With this minor retrofitting, the traps work great. I have killed three moles in a week. Be sure to follow the instructions from the other reviewers about finding active tunnels. That is important."
5,Worked for me,The Victor mole trap (with spears) worked for me.You have to follow the directions and carefully pull up on the spring to arm the trap. But it did work. No more tunnels.I tried many different chemicals and other techniques to get rid of a mole and none of the others worked.
1,Junk.,"Worked great...for a day. Then it stopped dimming. Just full on or off. Rechecked the wiring, just to be sure. Too bad, it was just what I wanted."
4,Good for an abstrat reasoning lesson,"The author that was upset at the insulting nature of the games on the cd has missed the point. I was introduced to the games in Vultiverible calc and I was shocked at first too. But then it hit me, these games are perfect for children and adults alike. If I asked you to picture a dy/dx you would maybe see a graph in your mind. These ""simple"" games take the abstract and make it logical. I'm buying it for my 6 year old so I can teach him to visulize relationships between a quantity and the measure of its volume or its change of state. I think the author did a good job at this. People of all ages tend to fail at calc for the same reason, Concepts. Once you know what to look for the math can be understood."
2,high cost for bunch of paper,pricey for a bunch of paper. it comes in a card box although nice bright colors i could've printed out most of the stuff on my own computer
5,Pretend and Play School,This is a wonderful product. I got it for an 8 year old for Christmas and she loves it as well as her 4 year old sister. I think a school age child would benefit from this product the most because of the different items within the box. However it would be a great teaching tool for pre-schooler's. I am a retired teacher and I am totally impressed with this product. My girls 4 and 8 love it !
5,Good book for kids....,"Book was in great condition when I got it and was on time. I bought the book for my 2 year old son who loves to read. We have the ""Eye"" book as well. He really liked that book so I figured he would like the tooth book as well. Unfortunately this book is a lot longer and doesn't keep his attention as much as the ""Eye"" book. However, if you are buying this for an older kid, it's a great read! I would deff recommend it!"
3,Not about losing the first tooth,"I was expecting a book about the tooth fairy coming. Not exactly what I wanted, but a good book. Perhaps such a book has not been written - at least I haven't found it. There are some, but not to my liking. Being able to see a couple more pages would have been most helpful."
1,illustrations are not multi-cultural,"You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional ""white"" depiction of the world."
2,Charlie O'Connell has to be the worst actor ever,i love crappy b-movies about giant creatures living in the water but this movie was pretty bad and not for the terrible plot or CGI but it was because of Charlie O'Connell. he makes this 87 min movie feelthat i am watching all of the Lord of the Rings Extended editions on a loop. at least there is women in bikinis in some parts so it was not a complete waste of time.
5,Mentzer's HIT program is easier on your joints.,I have read many of the reviews about the HIT training program and tried it myself. I think that many of the people who are critical of the program are forgetting that this program will have you working out infrequently with plenty of rest. If you were to train like this 3-5 times per week then without a doubt you would overtrain and possibly damage the joints. This is a great program and I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to make consistent gains. Mentzer's program gets tremendous results. Period!
4,Biggest There Is,This book is about a big blue whale and other things that's bigger than the big blue whale.This book use very big numbers of things to add up to compare them with one really big thing.This book tells about the universe and how big they think it is.our galaxy is the biggest yet.There are other galaxies that are probaly a million times bigger than ours. A blue whale is the biggest animal on earth but what is the biggest galaxy in space?
1,Air stones (wrong product again!!!!),I was sent Elite air stones in lieu of the Aqua Fizzzzz.....they are falling apart on me after a week of being in the water.....pieces of crap
1,What you see is not what you get,"Beware--The air stone in the picture is not what you receive. The product I received, although an elite air stone was definitely inferior to the product in the picture."
2,Broken Air Stone,I ordered two air stones but unfortunately one was broken when I received it and would only blow one big bubble. Too much hassle to return as the package was already opened so ended up with faulty equipment.
2,I almost hate to write this...,"Let me be clear that I absolutely adore Jeff Buckley. I love his music and I love his voice and I am incredibly sad that he is no longer with us. Grace is absolutely one of my favorite all-time albums.I really, really tried to like this DVD.But.This DVD is pretty terrible. The performance, and I really almost feel bad saying this, is really not good. The sound quality is a bit abrasive at times. I love Jeff's personality and he's so good with the crowd (even when they were bothering him) but musically, it wasn't up to par - and not in the ""it didn't sound like the album"" par. At times Jeff would play on a tangent and his bandmates would have to watch him just to figure out what the hell he was doing.I really wouldn't recommend it."
1,Poor audio quality !!!,"The sound mix is below standard and the show itself is not much better. I would not buy again this product.If you are a real fan, maybe its worth the money... otherwise you should avoid this DVD."
1,Can't see the hype,"I might get ripped for this review, but i honestly did not enjoy this DVD at all. I bought it after reading all the reviews on this site. Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind. I don't like his overexaggerated singing much, he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop."
4,Buckley for people that never got to see him live.,I never got to see Buckley in concert. This is sufficient. My single complaint is that the editing is shotty. There are too many cuts back and forth.
2,You get what you pay for.,These are not high quality check valves. The tolerance of the slip joint is a little large so make sure to use plenty of primer and glue in order to get a good weld. These have a screw holding the plunger together that sticks out into the inlet making it difficult to prim and glue.
3,Second best documentary on the subject,"This latest documentary form PBS about the War of 1812 isn't bad--its just not nearly as good as the other PBS film from 2006' on the same subject called ""The War that made America"". I have both films and watched both twice. The other film just does everything better in my view from narration, to explanation of the causes of the war, to 'reenactors' and voice overs that fill out the film. I'd give this film (at half the length of TWTMA by the way)2.5 stars while the 06' film is a 5+."
3,The first 100 pages,"reminds me why I like and dislike some of Lehane's work. This book was too long for me; the book got off the plot a couple of times. It was almost like he had written some good scenes and then forced them into the novel. Good writing, but didn't seem to move the story along. I'll still read anything Lehane puts out, the good (Midnight Mile) and the bad (Mystic River)."
4,"gone, Baby, gone","The book, Gone, Baby, Gone was very good. I had seen the movie but per usual the book and the film were not the same. The book was better and the film industry changes everything. A sequel is out to this book which I gave to my daugher for Christmas so have not read that one as yet. I know a lot about Boston and descriptions in the adjacent areas or parts of Boston were right on."
4,"Great Action, Twists; Characterization Lacks Something","This author is pretty good for 2nd tier (1st tier being Waumbaugh, Hiaasen, Ellroy, Mosely, etc.). Plotting is great and unpredictable, and reading makes a ""good ride"". Characters, however, lack something - but, hey, Agatha Christie never had any good characters, either, but could you guess her plots?Actually, I'm well beyond Agatha Christie, but I still like good characters. I also like a good plot. Unfortunately, you can't seem to get both at once except with a few authors.This guy is worth reading for plotting. Hopefully, his character development will become better."
1,disppointing,I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. The whole layout design is cold and dull. The pictures and quotes are average as well as the printing quality. I have a lot of cat books and all kinds of them. This is one I would not recommend to others.
2,"Alright, Alright, who told you to sing, you're a producer","This cd is somewhat whacked, there are a few songs on there that sound pretty good ""That Fire"", ""Coffee"" and #2 I can't think of what it's called. I'm from the West and I know Bosko can put out some beats, but he short circuited himself. Don't fool yourself buying this because you see all those featured artist like ""lil John, DMX and E40, you know they are all known for putting out a cut or two. Bosko stay with the beats bruh! you're almost untouchable on that tip. peace"
5,PB8 is GRREATT!,"Great product! My tummy problems have improved greatly. This was recommended highly by my local pharmacist, but it is nearly impossible to get PB8 at most drug stores here in Hawaii...and if it is available, oh, my! The cost is gastronomical!Thanks for making it available!Nutrition Now PB 8, Probiotic Acidophilus 120 capsules"
5,Great Product!,"I started taking probiotics when I started suffering from colon problems. I went to the healthfood store to purchase the PB8, which was recommended by the clerk. When I was almost out of them, I heard that you could get them cheaper on-line, so I found the same product for half the price. I ordered them from Amazon and received them in a few days, before I was completely out. I would highly recommend this product. I have not had a flare up and my colon is healing. I have taken these for 2 months now. I take 2 capsules at bedtime with a full glass of water. Try them. You won't be sorry. I will continue to re-order and save money. Another hint that might help is, the clerk at the healthfood store said to stay away from the over the counter probiotics at the drug store because they have fillers. These are all natural with no fillers."
5,PB8,I have been taking PB8 for two months know and it has greatly helped my IBS. I find that foods that once bothered my stomach are no longer a problem. I have had IBS for over 16 years and have tried many different products and none of them worked. PB8 has blown the others off of the map. I would definately recommend this product for anyone who has IBS
4,horrible customer service,"I have been taking pb8 since this past summer and it seems to help a great deal with my IBS which is brought on by stress. However, towards the bottom of this latest bottle I found 16 small white oval pills. I called Nutrition Now and they are now harassing me saying that they don't manufacture anything like this at their plant insinuating that this is my fault. Their customer service is extremely poor."
5,Amazing,"Have no more upset stomach or sourness. This stuff really works, I was sceptical like everyone else, but it really does work!"
5,Great Probiotic at a Great Price!,"This is my personal favorite among all the probiotics I've tried! Here are some of the reasons to take this probiotic compared to others:1) It provides both Lactobacillus Acidophilus and Bifidobacterium Bifidum, with a total of EIGHT strains and SEVEN billion bacteria per capsule.2) The cost is much lower compared to other brands of probiotics.[Calculations: The 60 capsule box with 7 billion bacteria per capsule costs only $5.95 (on April 2012), which works out to 1.4 cents per billion bacteria. Other brands are more expensive in comparison.]3) It comes in the VEGETARIAN variety, which is awesome!4) It WORKS! I haven't had lactose intolerance since taking these capsules (one in the morning, one at night)!!"
2,Not effective for constipation,"In my case, this product was not effective at all for treating my constipation, whereas other probiotic products were. In fact, based on the evidence, it may even make it worse. It may be a fine probiotic otherwise, but for my condition, it wasn't effective at all. Gee, it's nice to share, isn't it?"
2,Bland,rated as low sodium and very much true. Very high calorie with no flavor. I will snack on them for a low carb diet but add salt and pepper
2,The Magic is Gone,"It becomes clear that Anne McCaffrey is not doing the writing any more. The names are so convoluted and difficult to remember that one loses any sense of the story line of the original book that began this series. It is a shame that the dialogue no longer has Ms McCaffrey's poise and spirit. If you must continue this series, check it out from the library, do not waste any more of your money."
3,"Simple, but not in a bad way","The book is highly opinionated and tends to be more of a traing manual than a text book. Pieces of the productivity management process are displayed nicely most of the time, but occasionally seem to state the obvious multiple times while not addressing more difficult issues in staffing. The book could be divided into 2 parts more logically and one of them being 'organizing productivity management' and the other 'being a good manager of a team' or at least separated within the book.Overall the book is fine if you are needing to see in print what you should already know if you're a manager, or if you have never thought about managing projects before. It isn't a complete waste of money whatever your knowledge is though since it does have Maslow's hiarchy of needs in it."
2,Comments on The Collector's Guide by John E. Traister,"This book, while containing helful information to the beginning collector, suffers from very poor organization, excessive focus on modern reproductions of antique firearms, and numerous errors in pricing. Overall, the book lacks authority."
1,Wortless and expensive,"Completely worthless and a waste of time. About a third of the book that is supposedly about Linux is about how to write and publish HTML documents. Gives no valuable help on how to set up ppp, only gives the theory of it and *no examples*. Do not get this book, even though the cover looks nice."
1,"you will need other books, software is ok","This book is only good if you want the software. By now (2/98) the software is outdated. The other reader is correct about the Red Hat image being incorrect but the correct image is in another directory. It doesnt say it anywhere in the docs, you have to poke around the CD for it.The chapter on recompiling the kernel is incorrect. I had to use one of my older books for that. It also omits crucial ending steps so linux will see the new kernel.The chapter on PPP with pppd and chat is good but you can get that info anywhere. Actually the PPP HOWTO on the CD is better.In its section on Networking, it doesn't tell you that you have to add networking to your kernel to make all that TCP/IP stuff work. This requires a recompile but oops, that part is incorrect"
5,This Item Really Works,"I had seen ads for these items before, but figured it was a gimmick. Not true!I have some heavy weight denim work jeans that shrunk...I don't want to hear it; my 38 waist chinos still fit! The 38 waist jeans got smaller and smaller. So what to do? Spend $45 a pair for new jeans? Not with the Inch-Master on hand!This item is heavy duty, and is a quality made item from Germany. It may look like cheap plastic, but it is very sturdy and strong.I followed the instructions and streched out the waistband on these jeans from 37 to 38.5 inches. No more walking around with them unfastened behind my belt!Not only does it stretch your wasteband, but it streches your money, since you don't need to buy new jeans!"
4,A forgotten classic,"I hadn't seen this movie for years, but this Christmas my mom reminded me of it's existence, so I had another look. I won't give the story line in detail as that's available elsewhere, but suffice to say it's a wonderful story of grace, faith and entrepreneurial spirit set at Christmas time just after World War II. I think Catholics will appreciate it even more as it treats the subject of faith without tiptoeing around it or short-handing it. Those unfamiliar with nuns and the Catholic church will still enjoy it so long as they enjoy the slower paced gentle story telling of this era. There's humor in there, too, and wonderful performances from most of the cast. Hugh Marlowe, who I adore, isn't at his best here, but since his character isn't as 3-dimensional as it could be, he does a workable job."
1,Worst Printer,"I have had this printer for a year now. It's one of the worst printers I have ever had. Ink is EXPENSIVE, and if you don't use it often, the ink dries up. My XP system finally will not recognize it."
4,Good as factory-new!,"Just as good as the Wayne pumps I was replacing. What a great Amazon deal!! My Wayne sump pumps run virtually all winter - year after year with nary a problem. These reconditioned pumps look and perform as good as new. They tend to stand taller than some other brands, so that allows them to be used in a deeper sump and/or keeps the motor higher off the floor - both good features for a pedestal pump in a flooding situation.My only complaint is neither Wayne, nor any other brand I know of, has found a way to quiet the float rod rattle noise when it runs - hence 4 of 5 stars. My past experience tells me these pumps should be around for years of reliable service at less than the cost of getting just one at my local Ace Hardware."
2,Worked for two days,"Worked for two days, then the impeller stopped spinning. It worked very well for those two days, but the design needs some adjusting. A plastic impeller on a metal shaft doesn't work well. Return for refund underway."
4,Very sturdy and good price,"We chose this because the options in most stores are flimsy and will not accomodate someone that is lifting heavier weights. This is a substantial bench, and works perfectly, my only complaint is the large gap between the bottom and top piece is uncomfortable when in a flat or decline position."
5,great bench,"The bench is very sturdy and extremely easy to assemble, i think it took me like 15 minutes. All the screws fit perfectly and the leg extension part can be take off, which makes it easy to do sit ups and ab exercises. I would reccomend this product !!"
2,totally inaccurate,"The only thing on this that works well is the watch... the altimeter, thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings... the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience... it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least.."
3,It's ok but not the best,"complicated buttons, which seem to inconsistent performers, the compass stays on for 2 seconds and then goes off. It may be weak batteries (already!) but none of the buttons performed on my last trip when I needed a compass. I am disgusted with it now, but will change the batteries and give it another shot."
5,"Just a ""minor"" correction","This CD is really two albums in one (with the exception of one substitue song): ""Words and Music"" (1982) and ""All Alone with Friends"" (1983)---a total of 22 tracks. They are pretty much soft rock songs characteristic of the Journey and Survivor era. But rather than playing lead guitar with The Shadows (and singing harmony behind Cliff Richard), here Hank plays lead guitar . . . but SINGS SOLO. Now Hank is no Cliff, but I enjoy the sound. I play my own copy fairly frequently. But then again, I LOVE the music of Hank Marvin! (Long live The Shadows!)"
1,Install Locks Up with Fatal Error,"I purchased VS 11 after using version 9 because I had found some decent ratings for this upgrade on the internet and I was already familiar with VideoStudio and how it works. After receiving the application CD ROM I attempted to install the software, but after what appeared to be a successful install the setup installation froze during the final stages and then aborted with a Fatal Error message. Ater 3 unsuccesful attempts and one attempt using Ulead tech support suggestions I finally gave up.Ulead tech support was unnable to come up with any fixes so that I could successfully install their product. Very frustrating."
4,"""The Spear of Destiny""","Ravenscroft's book sent my synapses smoking. It also confirmed my suspicions that the Swastika was a very ancient symbol (having once spied it on a temple in India). This fascinating, frightening book is a must-read. Now I know where film maker Phil Kaufman (who wrote the original story for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which became a Larry Kasdan screenplay) got the name for the female lead in the picture...remember Marion RAVENwood?"
4,What a Deal!!,"At [a little money], one gets a fully operational OS and a manual on how to use it effectively. While there are siginificant differences between Red Hat 8 and 9 (differences which the book overlooks), the 24 hour teaching format does enough to help one get the essentials of this OS. I would definitely recommend getting this book and the accompanying CDs to any Linux newbie."
2,a major let down,"i saw this movie cause my old roommate was all infatuated with gavid gunn right. so i saw it. this movie is nothing i love in a vampire movie. no anything. i mean you can go 4 ways in a vampire movie. you can reach for the insane, you can go for sheer humor, you can make it sexy or you can keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. this movie does none of that. it just has you sitting there watching and waiting for the good part that never comes. this movie was just...... [bad]"
1,Are you kidding me?!,"I'm a horror film fanatic (as well as a filmmaker myself), but seriously the cover art for this film makes it look like an amazingly schlocky horror film from either the '70s or '80s; however, when I realized that this film was actually made in 1997 I couldn't believe my eyes. Nor, could I make it through more than the first five minutes of the movie. Special effects and visual production should never have been this terrible in the late '90s. For shame."
4,definately worth your while,a definate gothic sound track with portray an erie atmosphere in which the movie will play around...Although the acting isn't the best and the movie at times is a little choppy it is worth your time to sit and watch. Maybe even to buy so you could enjoy it more than once.
3,It okay,I got it for 10$ so it was worth the price. Can anyone tell me what is the name of the opening theme song to this DVD?
1,It's Flat & It's Not Funny,"I love Dave's TV show, it's really hilarious, so I was expecting a lot when I bought this DVD as part of a two-pack with Richard Pryor. After 10 minutes of Dave, I started thinking, ""when am I going to laugh?"" After 20 minutes, I got bored so I started listening to the audience for this live show. They were laughing (a little) & not all that often, so I concluded that it wasn't just my mood, this just wasn't funny. After 30 minutes, I turned it off. I can tell you that the first 30 minutes is a waste of your time, even if you're a Dave fan, as I am. I can't tell you if the rest is funny or not, because I didn't watch it. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I was expecting Richard Pryor, which I had watched first. My recommendation is either to buy only the Pryor DVD (which is terrific), or watch the Chappelle DVD first, so it won't suffer by comparison."
3,Too Short,"While I don't agree with the other reviewer, the material was funny as usual. However, it was just too short (58mins.) and there were no additional footage. I'd prefer to watch the actual Chapelle show."
4,i woulda gave it a 4.5,"the more i watch this, the more i love it. this dude runs my life...i find myself quoting this standup more than anything he ever put out. this dudes at the top of his game. all the haters can keep on hating but they know deep down they have more love for this dude than anyone in the game. in this one, the indian bit, the homeless bus bit, the monkey bit, the grape drink, the disney world, and of course the botox balls (my personal favorite). all of it is good...sm00th as eggs baby!"
3,Interesting - But Not Quite,"Maraniss calls Clemente ""baseballs last hero"" but does not a good enough job building the case. This book is jammed full of baseball minutia that is useful for detail oriented fans but not for a broader audience that is interested in why Clemente the person was so great.Yes- the book offers an inside look into Clemente the person but I doubt that it is either new or path breaking. I was left looking for more about the person- his interests, his passions, his personal life, his relationships with family and friends. How is the Clemente family viewed now in Puerto Rico? Were they even extensively interviewed for this book! This is a good baseball biography but just an average historical biography of an important person both on and off the playing field."
5,Letters At 3A.M.: Reports on Endarkenment,"I not only have read this book, but I also work for the publisher.To start, I would like to say that this book is not out of print.Personally, at Spring Publications (the publisher) we do some pretty heavy, dry writing. But Michal Ventura lightens things up just a bit with his looks into the American way of life. His essays range in topic from the neo-pagan rituals that he has participated (The Witness Tree) in to his own alcholism (In Defence of Alchol). (in his words, ""I don't like to drink alone, I love it."")For anyone looking to find good left in America, Letters at 3 A.M. is just the thing. In my eyes, it is one of the top five books I have ever read."
3,A Good Look at the Late 19th Century,"My favorite part of this book was the early part, where Roberts paints a picture of the 19th century and how it influenced the direction of the 20th century. As for his look at the 20th century, I believe he spends too little time on any one topic to shed much light on anything. I found his coverage of the past 20 years (my adult life) to be especially wanting. My recommendation would be to seek out history books with less ambitious scope."
4,Very engrossing,"This is an extremely readable book! What I like the best about the book is that each character is wholly human and believable. Her grasp of human psychology is excellent. Livesey pulls off the difficult feat of having many characters' points of view intersect effortlessly and smoothly: often what starts out as a likable character changes when we read how the other characters see him. Yet if you were to go back and read the book again from the beginning, you'd be able to pick up the clues about the character's true colors. Her portrayal of Jonathan is particularly sharp. I want to read her other books now."
2,doesn't bubble everywhere,"I was looking for something that would create a bubble curtain . This is bright blue, and i have natural stones so it's REALLY visible. Add to that it only bubbles from one tiny section. What's the point of a long rectangle shape is only one dize size section will actually bubble? I could have just stuck a tiny bubble stone on the end of the hose for that effect."
1,"Barely works, Doesn't Sink","I bought this stone because I thought it would be just that. A stone. I bought four of them for my outdoor pond, and only one of them sunk to the bottom. Well you might say I have too much air? Well I don't, the stone doesn't even put air out all the way though the stone, air flows out right away. As soon as the stone starts all the air leaks out. One of the stones did work fine. So for 3 of 4 stones, nothing work. One of the stones, worked just fine. If you need 1 working stone, buy 8. Not worth the puchase."
3,Not in love,"I linked 2 and my Tetra 40 gallon air pump couldn't make it bubble the full length, even after 2 weeks. I finally pulled one off."
5,Zeroll is made in USA and the best you can buy!,"This product is made in USA. It will cut through hard ice cream, yougart ice cream and sorbets. They also sell other side scoops that work just as well. I am thoroughly impressed by the quality, design and finish that went into this product. I have bought several scoops as gifts for our family's annual 4th of July celebration which traditionally involves the making of homemade ice cream from an old family recipe. Everyone who has received this is delighted with the product as well."
3,so so,"having the whole collection of jane eyre from the first to the last ever made, this one is about the worst made of all - from the protagonists to the make...it's really up to what you like and how you like the story to unfold - we didn't like this one so much"
2,NOT the best,"If you like the passionate Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version, you will find this disappointing. Cusack smiles too much; Jayston has rehearsed his lines, but he doesn't believe them, and neither will you. And they left out Rosamonde, so you have no sense of why St. John cannot love Jane. Don't bother with this one."
3,Company promptly replaced damaged product,"I ordered four jars of these great cocktail onions, but got only two, each of which was open and leaking. Don't know whether this was a packing issue or UPS's fault, but the company did promptly replace all four jars at no additional charge either for the product or the subsequent shipping. Hard to argue with the service!"
2,Problems loading labels,"I'm disappointed with this label printer, but I don't use it very much. Loading labels should be very easy according to the instructions, but in practice, it isn't easy to get them properly lined up and in the position to print properly. The printer also is wasteful of the labels, sending several blank labels out before printing the first one. If I had it to do over, I would skip buying this printer and print my labels on my laser printer."
2,"Fairly explicit, but mediocre production","While this video is much more explicit than most asian model videos (most of the scenes involve Miori masturbating), the production values are poor, and Miori Maijima is not really up to the standards of most models appearing in this type of video. She is slightly overweight, and her answers in the interviews are so dull as to be a bit depressing. The scenes themselves are a little repetitive, although they are so explicit that they are actually slightly censored in some places."
1,Subscribe & Save - Last Minute Price Increase,"On a ""Subscribe & Save"" automatic reorder, the product price was increased after the ""Your Subscription Order Will Ship Soon"" notification but before the ""Your Subscribe & Save Shipment Has Been Processed"" notification. This doesn't give the buyer any chance to skip the shipment or cancel the subscription if they don't like the price increase."
1,NO RECIVED,I'll never recived de item. I wrote to the seler they didn't a good answer to the problem. I pay but I don't have anything
2,Not That Much Music,"I should start off by saying that Old Crow Medicine Show is my favorite band. I like Mumford and Sons and listen to their album a bunch, but OCMS is the real reason I watched this film.I thought that there would be more time spent on the actual performances with this film. It was too artsy for me. They spent a long time setting up each band and then only a short bit of time (it seemed) actually showing their performances.I was most disappointed that they only had 3 OCMS performances on it. On top of that, one of my favorite Mumford songs gets cut off right in the middle by the editor. The movie is full of interviews and great scenery, but that is not why I watched the film. There are a few extra performances in the bonus features, but none that really get the energy that Old Crow exudes on their live DVD.Doesn't even compare to Old Crow Medicine Show Live at the Orange Peel and Tennessee Theatre."
3,Could have been better,"We are big fans of both these bands! I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and you can tell he's disappointed by it. It's fun, but they never actually sing a whole song through, not a single one...so a little disappointing."
5,"clear, informative, down-to-earth, readable, useful","I've had this book since 1983. I've worked off and on with Unix, mainly as a technical writer using a Unix text editor. This book has *never* let me down. It's easy to follow and it's packed with relevant examples. It's great as an introduction for newcomers and also as a reference for those who have had exposure to Unix."
4,"Content great, but not on Kindle","The content of this book is exactly right for me--I'm coming up to 50 and want to lose 15 pounds, and Roizen's strategy both is medically sound and personally sensible (starting with a month-long commitment to walk 30 minutes a day before launching into weight training works for me). But I purchased the book on a Kindle and although 80% of the text isn't affected, formatting of the charts and illustrated instructions for exercises doesn't work out well (even when using the smallest type size). Secondly, it includes a form to measure your progress--well, obviously, you can't fill it out or print it out (hmm, perhaps Kindle should allow you to print out selected pages)."
3,Les Versions Longues [IMPORT] - Indochine,"Indochine grew out of the 80's decade and sounds alot like the American 80's New Wave music. If you like New Order, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, you'll like this twist. It's positive, trippy music in French. I love the ""3eme Sexe"" track and happy-as-can-be ""Kao Bang"" track."
3,"Part brilliant Constitutional scholarship, part liberal gobleygook","Some great stuff in here about Americas problems, with meaningful statistics and a true insider understandig of how the political system actually works. But at other times logic flawed and some solutions absurdly liberal--like abolishing the 2nd amendment. No, I'm not a gun nut, but I shudder to think how few freedoms we would have if the 2nd amendment didn't exist. Nor did I just summarily say anything not consistent with my philosophy is gobleygook. But good lord, as powerful as our government is, with all the abuses of Bush & Clinton, it is petrifying to even contemplate such a measure. Still, the only real solution is a Constitutional Covention, and this book provides a road map, which is useful no matter what your feeling about specific amendments proposed by the author."
5,Durable and Comfortable,"There's not much more to say here. The shoes are well made and have a comfortable fit. Just as good, if not better, than other brands. You know, THOSE brands that make you pay more to wear the name. Recommend to everyone who is on their feet all day in a professional atmosphere. And they are easy to clean off--take it from a Veterinary Technician (I'll leave it to your imagination to conjure reasons for me needing to clean them often...)"
4,Great CD by Can-I-Bus,"Even though Canibus was told to change his style for this CD, he did a good job making this CD even though some of the songs suck because its not the same Canibus. I couldnt imagine Canibus making whole tracks based on clubs and bitches and stuff.1. 33 3's - 5/52. Canibus Man - 5/53. Atlanta - 2/54. Gybaotc - 3/55. In The Rain - 4/56. Mind Control - 5/57. Last Laugh - 5/58. Not 4 Play feat. Kurupt - 3/59. Stupid Producers - 5/510. Talk The Talk - 4/511. Nobody - 3/5Cant wait till Hip-Hop 4 Sale comes out. Good job Bis."
4,great album from the lyrical genius,"I give this album 4 stars because canibus is unable to make a bad album. Even though i give it 4 stars some tracks are just o.k. and some are already on the internet. Don't get me wrong there are many new very dope tracks on here tracks like alanta, gybaotc, and in the rain, all new to me tracks to me really stand out on this album. This album is for sure worth the money but hope the other album coming out in may(hip-hop for sale)is off tha hook! Canibus hopfully will be entertaining us for years to come."
3,Sad times for the greatest,"Are the other reviewers listening to the same album i did? I am one of Canibus's biggest fans. This album is mediocre at best. The beats are horrible except for 1-2 of them. Lyrics are great but nothing to write about. Canibus....how in the hell are you gonna go from ""c-true hollywood stories"" to ""Rip the Jacker"" then back to wack production again? Don't get me wrong...there is no emcee that can top Canibus (maybe Chino XL...) but why does he mess around with nasty/wack production?Where is Stoupe of Jedi Mind Tricks?"
2,Production is key,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviewer. I will buy anything Canibus does as long as Stoupe from Jedi Mind Tricks, is producing. Rip the Jacker was his best album by far and the only Canibus one I still listen to often."
3,"Good content, poorly organized","The information in this book is indispensable for anyone communicating or doing business with government officials in the U.S. and abroad. However, I must say that it needs some serious editorial attention.As this is a reference book, I find it incomprehensible that there is no index for the section on titles and forms of address. For example, if I am preparing a letter to a foreign cabinet minister, I should be able to easily find the page number rather than flip through almost 200 pages of listings.I recommend this book because there apparently are no alternatives on the market. However, if the publisher is reading this, PLEASE consider a more comprehensive table of contents for the next edition."
5,Great and Effective,"I had a very hard time getting my baby to sleep and this book has helped me understand more about sleep paterns, sleeping habits and routines. If followed, the solution they give is very succesfull within a few days, but be prepared to hear a little crying."
1,Not good for real world application,"This book was made for college students. It has alot of statistics and historical information that would provide fodder for a semester of lectures for people who will never own a hotel but not really applicable to the real world and the people who really run hotels.It does not really give the realities of hotel operations and restaurant management. It does not give procedures or even discuss the import aspects of hotel operation. It is missing the real world application of managment concepts. Anyone interested in really running a hotel should not get this book.I would suggest getting ""Front Office Operations & Management"" by Ahmed Ismail or some other book that provides checklists, real world application of theory, marketing techniques, reservation softwares, etc. I am just glad I got the book used."
1,It took forever to receive this book....yet NOT received!!,"I ordered this book since 9 Sept 2011. To-date, 18 November 2011 I still not receive it.... Where to complaint? Who to complaint to? What take it so long to shippppppppp??? The book can go round the world by now!!! Disappointing Amazon experience!!!!!!!"
4,A different view of Captain Kidd.,"Ritchie does an extremely able job of refocusing the story of Captain Kidd away from being a personal drama. Instead, he builds an image of the world where Kidd was one of many trying their luck at this (then) semi-legal trade. Piracy was the only place left for a sailor who loved the sea but not the navy.As a reader, it was interesting to see Kidd transformed from the pirate figure of legend into a semi-competent adventurer who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time in British history. Ritchie also provides a fascinating look at the 17th-18th century justice systems.Ritchie is less of a writer than a historian, unfortunately. There were a number of places at the beginning of the book where I felt lost as to where he was trying to go. However, as another reader notes, this improves later on in the book.Recommended for readers with a particular interest in pirates."
1,Disappointing,I'm a fan of Opera music. This album is blasphemous. The voices of the singers don't blend at all. Each voice tries to gain over others's. It's as if they were trying to compete... Really disturbing.
1,The musiac left me cold,"I was most disappointed by this CD, it left me cold, I was truly hoping to like it and wanted to enjoy it, but there was no real feeling behind the songs, give me Josh Gorban. Not even the title ""canto a la vita"" could redeem this turkey. No star is what it would get if I had my way. Oh, and did I mention I returned the CD to the store, demanded and got my money back?"
2,I could have been listening to Il Divo...,"This CD was just not my cup of tea. I bought it on the recommendation of a friend and the samples on Amazon that I listened to were good. However, to me the entire CD as a whole was just too over the top. I'm sure others enjoyed it, but I didn't expect it to be as ""opera"" as it was."
2,Not designed for WinXP,"I had trouble getting the Docking Station to work in Windows XP Media Edition. I read the instructions exactly. However, my computer kept saying there was a hardware failure. The failure error caused my computer to continually shut down continually. I restored my computer to original factory settings several times. The computer would give the error message and shut down after installing the docking station software and attempting to use the docking station."
3,i love Martika's voice!!!!!!,"i grew up on tiffany, debbie and martika i love all of them too this day and i love all there recent work Tiffany- dust off and dance and Debbie gibson - naked but i can't seem to get into the music that Martika has created with Oppera, i bought the first cd by Oppera and i was only pleased to hear Martika's voice if your a true Martika fan buy this album and the first album to support a great singer who know's maybe you'll like it!!"
3,"rock us, martika.","i have to admit, i prefer my martika a little more r&b/pop-y than her work with oppera has been, but i can't just get enough of her voice, so i keep buying her cds. even though the music isn't my typical style, it's undeniable that her voice is very well-suited to rock. while my favourite track on oppera's debut was the playful ""that's just the way it is"", this album's stand-out track, for me, is the more serious ""rock us anna""."
1,very bad and horrible state of book,"I bought to amazon a ""new SCJP book""...it is in a very bad condition,CD was broken, almost 40% of pages are in a very bad state ""kind of dirty"",I go the books like if it were squeezed by a 'strong guy'.That's why i rate it to 1...because i supposedly bought a new book."
5,Very Good and Thorough,The book covered the material pretty well. The code examples do a good job of supporting the material.
2,Don't buy it.,"I love espresso, it is too bad I have to go to Starbucks every time I want one.My first experience with an espresso machine was a Krups. It lasted 15 years, so when it failed I went out and bought another one for around $50 which is the closest model to the original one we had. It didn't even work for 3 months before failing! So, we decided to try and buy something a little more expensive. The Cuisinart EM-100 is more expensive and lasted almost a month (will not build up pressure any more)! The sad thing is the EM-200 only lasted for 4 months, it just locks up and will not do anything unless you unplug it for at least 6 hours. That is right, 6 full hours, 5 1/2 and it might make you 1/2 cup of espresso before locking up again. What a joke I will never buy another Cuisinart. I can't decide if it worth trying a $400 to $1200 machine for espresso at home, I guess I'll just drive to Starbucks whenever I want one."
4,nice machine,"I purchased this machine a few weeks ago. I have an inexpensive coffee grinder. The machine comes with an instructional DVD which I watched. Making capachino is a very simple process. The water reservoir is large and so can make several cups of coffee before needing a refill. I have used Seattle's Best coffee and this machine produces a nice cup of flavorful coffee with a nice crema on top. When you switch to steaming to froth the milk, I have found that you do get an initial very small stream of water prior to the steam, but I simply point the wand over the reservoir until it starts steaming, then froth the milk. I have found this to be a very nice machine for the price and a good value so far..."
1,"Broken from box, despicable customer service","We received this product as a Christmas gift. Out of the box, the water pump did not work. We have a Keurig that has water pump issues and we have been able to fix that pump before but with the Cuisinart- nothing. It simply does not pull water. We called customer service and their policy states that we have to pay for the return shipping and receiving of a new device. She also expressed that they have not have any reports of issues on this product, but you can clearly see from the reviews on Amazon that a significant number of people have issues on their first run with the machine. I will not be buying or endorsing the Cuisinart brand in the future."
1,It just doesn't work.,"Last year my dear husband bought this for me for Christmas. It worked for about a month making ""ok"" tasting espresso- a little bitter, but I thought with time I could prefect it. I was disappointed as we bought this to replace my 15 yr old Krups machine that we had already given away. First off it just flat out didn't work with the 1 shot basket. After about a month or so it just stopped working- it would get nice and hot, steam milk etc but no espresso would come out, and when it did it was spotty or shot out over extracted. We are highly disappointed that we wasted nearly $200 on this hunk of junk."
1,A complete rip off,"I don't usually review items, but in this case I must say, that it from the first cup was intolerably slow, and was easily clogged despite washing carefully everytime. The pump vibreates so hard that you have to stand and keep your hand on the cup (I use a pyrex pitcher for accurate measurement and the darned thing nearly vibrated that heavy 8 oz pyrax pitcher right off the machine) the whole time. I just made a doppio that took 15 minutes. The frother is also inefficient, doing a decent job one time in five. I see better reviews, so maybe I just got a lemon, but should anyone get a lemon at a $150?"
1,LEAKS,"Do not buy, I just returned mine after 9 months. Could not fix leak and then the steamer rod fell out..."
1,LOOKING TO BUY EM-100 CUISINART READ THIS,"I purchased this ""expresso machine""; We couldn't make it work.I returned it at my own expenses.The 2nd machine is not capable of brewing a real expresso coffee. For the ones that know what an expresso coffee taste like this ""MACHINE DOESN'T WORK"" dont buy it I lost my money & time. If you have an empty space on your kitchen counter it can serve as an nice decoration that is all that is good for."
3,EM-100 1000 WATT cuisinart,the 2 cup basket was plugged up when recieved unit and I have had to order a new one that is now on back order and I do not like the way the unit makes the froth. Very hard to get a good froth.
3,I thought I had it bad...,"After reading some of these reviews I guess I don't have it so bad. My complaints are more annoying than defective. This machine does make a great cup of coffee.On the downside it vibrates to the point you have to watch the pitcher until it starts to fill or it will move from under the basket.The warming tray on top of the unit is useless. I checked it's temperature with my infrared thermometer and it's only 98.8 degrees.It wastes water. I use bottled water in mine and it releases excess water in the dump pan when you turn it off. Not a huge deal, but when you are paying for water, you hate to pour it down the drain.Lastly, it's loud.Were it not for a good cup of coffee I'd have to rate it a two, but I'll be nice and give it three stars. The next unit I buy I will be paying more attention to reviews before buying. (I've had this unit for about a year)"
4,Great value for the money.,I ordered this two days before Christmas. I received it Christmas Eve. My wife opened it up and fired it up Christmas morning. It worked great. Easy to follow directions. The Cappuccino was as good as Starbucks.
