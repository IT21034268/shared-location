3,WHATEVER ;-(~,"True Tamora Pierce and magic fans, don't bother with this. It isnt worth buying, so if you REALLY want it get it from a library or second hand bookstore(there are probably a few people who gave it away. Unlike the Lioness Quartet (5 stars all the way! ) and The Immortals (another 5 stars, I love Daine, Numair is WAY too old for her, Neal is right) there is no development of Kel, the main character, or of magic, of which she has none, what happened to a MAGICAL world? There is no REAL antagonist, just everyday simple problems like people hating you. Alanna had the most powerful magic guy to hate her, PLUS some boys, and Daine had all those creepy monsters, Orzone AND the Queen of Chaos and a just a couple full armies. This really isn't worth much for a magic lover and for people that say ""I'd love to be Kel's friend"" Daine or Alanna would be more fun. Duh."
1,a shallow find for mature readers....,"This is a book about a little girl who wants to be a knight. Ms. Pierces's writing style and presentation are too cutesy, too prepackaged. One gets the impression that she tries too hard to impress and to hold the reader's interest with her heavy use flippant humor - which could certainly make it entertaining enough for elementry readers. However, it is a shallow find for those who might have the thirst for subtlety and a more complex, subdued hue."
4,I've been holding my breath since I read it!,"Ever since I read this book (about 5 months ago) I've been waiting with baited breath to find out what happens. It starts off Keladry(Kel) of Mindelan has just decided to become a knight. Ever since Alanna (Lioness Quartet) became King's Champion, it has been legal for girls to become knights. So against the better judgement of Lord Wyldon, the guy in charge of the training, she is accepted. The only catch is Alanna is to have NO contact with her. And Kel is on probation unlike any boy. After Kel gets to the palace no one wants to beseen dead with her except Neal, Duke Baird's son. Kel learns to deal with bullies, unfair treatment and fear. It's a really great book! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was it wasn't written like the Alanna and Daine books. It's more like the Circle of Magic books, kind of young seeming. It's still a great read though!"
2,Not at all as good as her other books,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I expected better from Tamora Pierce. She's a great author; I love all her other books. Especially the Lioness and Immortals series, but this book was just boring and dull. Nothing unexpected happened. It was a totally predictable story."
2,BRING BACK THE LIONESS!,"Not what I expected, I've read her other two Tortall series and this wasn't nearly as good, It had a horrible plot and bad character devolopment, although some of the ideas are good. Tecnicly, shouldn't Princess Kalisen have been the next girl page? And wheres the humor that was present in all the other books? No swordfights, no plot twists, nothing. It's a quick, boring read. Frankly, I miss the Rogue, Gary, Rauol, Alex,and Graerth the Elder. They added a style to the books and I felt I knew them. Kel is just some girl. Her fief isn't even in Tortall. I expected more from the best author in the Universe. I want to see more of Allanna and George(though I can do without Jonathan). If you want to read this book, don't buy it. BRING BACK THE LIONESS!"
3,"Interesting, but not her best. . .","As a long time reader of Tamora Pierce, I must say that on the whole, she does excellent work. However, the Protector of the Small series is definitely not on par with her other works. The story was good, but Kel is nowhere near as compelling a character as Alanna or Daine, or even the four children of the Circle of Magic series. She just doesn't interest me that much. Also, I found that the 'new' version of Tortall simply didn't seem to fit with the earlier series. The aura of myth and magic has (with the exception of the immortals) been almost entirely dispelled, and while Kel herself is unGifted, this makes this world that much less interesting. The changes that have taken place, especially in palace life, seem incredible given the time scale. I just can't see things changing that much that quickly. I think it would have been better to set this story at a much later time, perhaps (though I hate to think about it!) some time after Alanna's death."
1,The book to trash.,"I thought that Kel would be fighting more immortals. And I thought that Kel was a very typical""do-gooder."" Complete with all the lectures on morality.That thing about letting the pages get pushed aroung was dumb. As in dumb.As in kill Kel. Have Joren slip poison into Kel's food. Kel's way too naive."
1,very very bad,"Okay... I will admit that I haven't fully read this book. I started reading and gave up in disgust. The 'prejudice' that Kel gets seems forced. Tortall has had a 'female' Kings Champion for ten years and the guards to the Mother Goddess are females, so the 'weak female' prejudice doesn't ring true, especially from the man who has to train her. Yes it's a medieval world, yet the queen can fight and so does her bodyguard, the queen's riders are amongst the best fighters in Tortall and many women swell their ranks, so why would people be against female Knights... Surely with the history of Tortall, people would know that some women can fight.To have a book that focuses solely on kel's desire to be accepted as a knight, by laying the sexist attitudes on her with a trowel, particularly in a world like Tortall, seems wrong. And I couldn't get past the 'no women can become a Knight, they're too weak' attitudes from the council. Particularly given the recent history of Tortall."
1,Snore!,"This book was, how should I put this? Snore! I am a biiiiiiiig fan of Tamora Pierce but I was very dissapointed in this book. I mean, come on! There was no suspense, and no action. Kel doesn't have anyone to fight except for that bully. And it is pretty obvious that Kel is going to stay. Also, there should be more more of Alanna, George, Daine, and Numair. Tamora, if you are reading this, please make a more interesting part and have the other characters having a bigger part!"
4,Another great book by Tammy!,"When I got this book, I thought that it would be pretty much the same as the Lioness series, but I was proved wrong. While this series has the same theme, about a girl going against the grain, trying to prove girls are just as good as guys, Tamora Pierce managed to make it completely different. The character, Kel, has her own personality, fears, and ambitions. Pierce tied many of her other characters in as well. Alanna the Lioness is what motivates Kel, along with her mother. This series isn't called the Protector of the Small series for nothing! As the story goes, Kel stands up for smaller kids, and ends up getting multiple black eyes, bruises, and trips to the ""stump"" for her efforts, making both friends, and enemies, along the way.Over all, this book was funny, warm, and satisfying. I definitely recommend it to girls (and guys!) if your looking for a good read."
5,A great companion to the O'Reilly EJB book,This workbook is a companion guide to the book Enterprise JavaBeans (3rd edition) published by O'Reilly and written by Richard Monson-Haefel. This workbook walks the reader through installing and configuring WebLogic 6.1 as well as deploying the examples described in the EJB book.This is a very readable book that explains some of the WebLogic-specific requirements as well as best practices for dealing with EJB's (EJB 2.0 spec) in a WebLogic environment. I highly recommend this book for anyone working with EJB's on the WebLogic application server.
1,Sorry - Just doesn't work,"This book is the companion to Enterprise JavaBeans by Monson. First, this book is free for download (I didn't by it either). Second, it's almost not worth the time to download. I've found that the explanation for the examples don't work and there is no depth to the examples. I've tried to email the author but the yahoo email given bounced back. I'm surprised at the complete lack of topic and mention of real tools provided with Weblogic such as DDInit.ejb, DDInit.ejb20, etc. which create the deployment descriptor's under weblogic. This book simply explains how to install Weblogic (which is simply a few button clicks) and states that you should execute ""ant"" to build the beans with a predefined build.xml script. What are you really going to learn from that? I know I'm going to get a lot of flack from this post but I'm sorry, this book is definitly not worth a purchase. I'm suspect about previous reviews providing a five star rating."
2,where's Sandy B when you need her?,"So, I had to have this one because I was in love with Karmadelic's two previous singles, ""Check It Out"" and ""Nothingness"". Both of those singles contained awesome remixers (Razor N Guido, Junior Vasquez, Hard Attack) which ripped the original versions into fierce club stompers. They also had the vocal stylings of the fantastic Sandy B. This track has neither of those things.I would not suggest buying this single. I would wait until the album comes out if you're that interested in hearing this song. Every single mix sounds the same and is totally not worth your time.1) Flip The Mix - 8:002) Flip The Instrumental - 8:003) Journey To The Dub - 8:284) Journey To The Dubstramental - 8:285) A Cappella - 5:38The refrains of ""the journey is the best part"" is true in most songs, but only when the journey takes you somewhere. Which this track does not.Bland and dull. Skip it."
3,More gore in this one,"The Hollows series is fun, witty reading and I've nearly devoured the series back to back (currently reading the 7th & final installment). I rated the other five books with a 4 or 5, but I give this one a 3 only because GBU contains the most gore, which didn't appeal to me. It did help tighten the overall plot and characters from the first book, and by the end I really felt connected and ""in the know"". Rachel is a kick-ass kinda witch with a sense of justice and a soft heart for those close to her. I enjoy the play/danger between her and Ivy, and the comedy relief of Jenks. And I love reading all the ins & outs of witchcraft, vampirism, and pixy-hood. Definately a worthy series."
3,Good talent seeking polish? editor?,"I do like this series, but I agree with those who say that the author needs polish. I just give her more stars than someone like NYC Sela does for good ideas and development of an intriguing, overarching plotline. I didn't notice the repetitive phrasing, although it was probably there. Maybe I mentally skipped ahead. The typos are more the editor's fault than the author's, but they're jarring. Rachel did get annoying in parts. It was as if I could see the author manipulating her with the other characters at times. Overall, I felt like I was reading an advanced copy or earlier draft rather than a published novel.Although it doesn't look like it will happen, I hope the author takes some time to sit down and polish her next book. This second book seemed much more rough than the first. I imagine her editor just wants her to ""strike while the iron is hot,"" and milk her series for all its worth."
5,Rachel Rocks,This is one of the best series I have read. I would recomend it to anyone who needs to escape reality.
4,"Really good, with just the right enough bad",Again Kim Harrison gives a plot that doesn't rely on overt sex acts to keepm you interested. It kept me guessing until the end and even then I still wanted more. Can't wait for the next installment.
3,Finicky Calico,"I have mixed feelings and so does my calico cat, Scooter,about Hill's Science Diet Mature Beef Entree. Scooter is 8.5 years old. So I thought she'd love it. Guess not. She rejected it the ""gourmet"" cat food after the second day. With her head held high, she walked away! To get her to eat it, I had to put dry cat food on it or give her a wet pouch of morsels. So I recommend it, but be creative."
2,"Not minced, this is ground beef","Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced. The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef. My cat ONLY likes minced. Not chunks, not ground. Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product. The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all."
5,Quality laser printer,"My friend had one of these and he was real happy with it, which prompted me to get one as well. (A rebate helped, too.) It's been four weeks and I'm quite happy with this no-frills laser printer. High quality build, and fast! The print quality is comparable to the HP Laserjet 4100 in my office. Loading paper takes a bit getting used to, but if you are familiar with inkjet's, I don't think this is a problem. I use the printer with Windows XP and the software options work great. I don't print that much, but I think this is designed for moderate printing in a home or SOHO. If you run XP, you can also set up XP's network printing so you can print to this printer from any PC in the house/office."
1,Now you see it - now you don't,"It is bad enough that this printer is extremely tempermental, finding a toner cartridge is next to impossible. Keep plenty on hand since the chances of finding one at your local office store is slim."
4,AAAhhh Memories,"The new author on the block for vampires - unique & different, thank you, I needed a change. Very light and easy to read....."
1,Truly a Terrible Printer!!!,I highly suggest you do not purchase this piece of junk. It has been nothing but nightmares trying to deal with the constant paper jams.
1,Partially broke first month i bought it...,"bought this printer 2 years ago while i was in college.- within first month of owning it a plastic object broke off (the auto detecttion for open cover). so for 2 year ive had an old pair of scissors propped into the place where the plastic broke off just to get the machine to work.- the plastic paper holder broke off rather easily, so ive had to place a piece of cardboard under the printer to hold the paper to feed.- exp. freq. printer jams + bad prints. off set type- ink cartridge spilled a ton of ink. just realized that as i removed a gum-sized hardened ink from the bottom of the printer. so it must have been wasting ink the whole time as well.works fine for basic printing needs (words only), image quality for photos or images is pretty basic. but really, this printer is poorly made.looks nice but its a dud."
1,why is there no half-star rating?,"Take a song that should never have been tampered with. Turn it over to idiots who make ""music"" by chopping up bits of other people's songs and calling the stuck-together mess their own. Glaze it with a lot of techno-trickery that's going to sound painfully dated in five years, no, make that two months. Release it to the public, and put the resulting money into Mick and Keith's already overstuffed bank accounts.I would say something about how utterly crass this proves the modern-day Stones to be, that they would allow one of their best songs to be ravaged and prostituted this way. But I think we all know now that what's left of the Rolling Stones is nothing but a corporate touring machine.This is sad.Don't you have something better to do with your money, your time, and your ears?"
2,Unnecessary remix CD...,"The Stones' 1968 classic (originally from Beggar's Banquet) remixed by three contemporary remixers (The Neptunes, Fatboy Slim and Full Phat). Each remixed version appears twice, once as a radio remix and once as full length remix. None of the remixes enhance to the original, and actually become increasingly annoying the longer you listen. The original appears as track 7, but is unnecessary, because most (if not all) fans of the song own the Beggar's Banquet album, Forty Licks or have this song somewhere in the various reissues that have come out over the years. Cool cover art, however..."
2,Don't waste yer $$$$$,"OMG, dude! What a waste of CD's.One remix of the song I think I can deal with, but all these???I love this song; don't get me wrong- but why so many remixes?Who is going to listen to this?The original is the best and it's not replaceable, so steer clear of this!"
2,Very Basic - For those with little or no Unix/Linux exp.,"I was very disappointed with how simple and basic this book is. I am even more disappointed with all the high marks the other reviewers gave this book. It briefly describes many aspects and Unix services, but does little to teach the user on how to configure any of them. I would only recommend this book to those users who are very new to IP Networking and Operating Systems in general. Even if you are new to Unix/Linux, this book does not do much to advance your skills. I am by no means an Unix expert. I am pretty advanced with Windows NT Administration (2 Years), but have only been using Redhat Linux for the passed six months. This book does not offer me anything that I can't figure out on my own about the Solaris Enviornment, and definately nothing to offer about the Unix enviornment in general. You may want to buy another Solaris/Unix book."
3,I wish I could do 3.5 stars,"It is a very nice product, but there is some overhang into the 3rd row seating area...so...really nice product...pretty good fit...would still buy again."
2,Doesn't stand the test of time...,"Our kids received the Jumbo Music Block as a gift for Christmas of 2001. Since that time, it has surprised me how little our kids have played with this item. Amazon.com rates this toy for 24 months and older, but I submit that the interest for this toy probably ends at 24 months (Neurosmith rates the age range as 12 months and older). The effective age range for interest in this toy should be considered between 12 and 24 months. The Jumbo Music Block would seem to hold the interest of a child who does not move around a great bit, but as soon as our youngest child could easily move around on her own, the interest in this toy disappeared. It is hard for a toy to be educational if your children don't play with it.....The durability rating is a reflection on the fact that we have had no problems with the toy, but this should be judged keeping in mind how little the toy has been used."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Toy!,"I am uncertain who loves this toy more - my wife or my son! It is just the right size (big but not TOO big) for my 1 year old who is toddling to stand next to and use - or merely lean on and set off! The colors are bright, the shapes clear, the objects under the shapes interesting, and the jingles are both educational and stick in your head for days! The ability to make the toy new again by adding a cartridge is great and I loved the free Jazz cartridge that came with it. The block teaches shapes and numbers well and could only be improved by adding colors to what it taught!"
4,Fun for all and educational!,"My 12 month old received this as a Christmas gift. I must admit at first I was a little apprehensive about the block, but now we all love it. My 3 year old enjoys it too. He walks around singing the songs about the different shapes. We also have a few other cartridges and they are great (especially the Tiger one). Well worth the money for extra cartridges!!"
5,Love it!,"I purchased the Jumbo Music Block for my first granddaughter, hoping to keep it for her first birthday. She discovered it at 6 mos. and loves it! She just turned 1 and she can zip and unzip; she's working on the button and identifies 1-2-3;a-b-c. She used the block to help her walk(at 9 mos!), sliding it across the floor. The block has the classical cartridge and we all love to ""sing"" along! LOVE IT! GREAT BUY!"
5,Pure entertainment!,My entire family really enjoyed viewing the DVD.A most outstanding musical movie. It's amazing how good a movie can bewithout dialog- just music.
4,One More Time,"That's my title, because you really have to watch it twice to really appreciate the work that was put into this.The music is amazing, of course, and very repetitive. Also, there's no dialogue. You need to be prepared for that, otherwise friends you want to enjoy this will be upset.Visuals are fun and funky. They even toss in a CG scene or two to emphasize the city stature. You should take a look at the ""Making Of"" extra in the extra features menu.The story is neat and presented sufficiently in the way everything is sequenced on the screen. There are no real plot holes, and some of the concepts are so bizarre and retro. In one particular scene, I commented, ""This is where it goes all Scooby Doo."" You'll see many retro animation and 70's pop culture references in this movie.If I could change one thing, I would maybe change the transitions between songs, but other than that, it's all groovy."
5,Great animated musical,"If you like Daft Punks Discovery album then you will love this movie. With no words or dialogue, the movie really speaks for itself. Such a beautiful incredible and exciting animated movie."
4,Great artistic production,First time buying from amazon and it went well got my dvd in a couple of days. Interstella 5555 is a musical and visual thrill. Even though it's as long as listening to a cd all the way through you get a full cinematic feel and even without many words spoken you'll never feel lost in what's going on. Both song and video fit perfectly to tell you exactly what's going and and how the characters feel.If you like Daft Punk or just enjoy a good work of art check this out.Daft Punk - Interstella 5555
4,Great 4 Parties,The music in the beginning is the best part. If you are buying the movie for the story line forget about it because the ending sucks. But if you are buying this because you are a true Daft Punk fan this is a great buy for a good price.
2,"Terrific Film, Horrific Transfer","I didn't want the reviews on Amazon to be right, but they are: the Blu-Ray release of Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto's masterpiece is flawed, to say the very least. Even with my Blu-Ray player's smoothing in place, there are a lot of artifacts and the entire thing looks like it was shot through gauze. My theory is that Interstella 5555 was originally mastered and edited for 480p and they never bothered to edit the film for higher resolutions or projection, which is something that's affected many anime and live-action TV series.I would recommend just sticking with the DVD version:Daft Punk - Interstella 5555, particularly as the ""extras"" on this disc are next to non-existent."
3,Courtesy of Books Love Jessica Marie,"River Town is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to learn more about China, or are planning on living abroad for an extended period of time. I thought that the book was very interesting and was fascinated with the way the Chinese of Fuling treated Peter Hessler during his stay. It would be very helpful to know a little about China's past, as Peter Hessler mentions many different movements and leaders without going into detail, which can lead to many readers feeling lost. The reader also has to remember that this book is the opinion of just one person who lived in a remote part of China and should not consider his experiences to be the norm for a forgeiner living in China."
5,Packed with hilarious remarks & profound insights,"The book is peppered with hilarious remarks about small details and profound insights about Chinese culture. And it is very well written.What Hessler describes in his book is what all foreigners notice when they come to China and observe the locals, I guess. I starting living in another province about 10 years after his stay in Fuling, yet I was struck by the same things. Except maybe the omnipresence of political propaganda, but it may be due to his position in the education system. The attitude of the ""laobaixing"" is not the same here in Shenzhen, but I lived in a small town for a few months and it was much closer to what Hessler describes.Easily readable. Highly recommended if you are wondering how the ""Chinese system"" works."
4,River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze,"Hessler's account of his time as a Peace Corps' volunteer offers a unique view of a foreigner's life in China. His humor, introspection and just good writing make a for an excellent read--one I had a hard time putting down. Hessler's evince's maturity beyond his years and I look forward to future accounts of life in China."
5,"Warm, insightful, personal and engaging","My son who lives as a foreigner in China directed me to read the book, and I found it wonderful.Not only does it provide a dynamic insight into the country's present thinking (through Hessler's students' essays), but it allows us to watch his efforts to move gently and gracefully through his new local society, with varying success.More than just enlightening, it's wonderfully entertaining, as we share the bittersweet adventure of joining a culture that's so hard to decode. I read the book before a trip to Beijing, and thought about it every day I was there, and often since."
4,Learning the Chinese Culture,Wish I had read this before our trip to China. Lots of insights to the difference of culture.Enjoyed it tremendously.
5,A nice and close observation of China,"As a native from the very province Hessler talked about in this book, I feel it's a very accurate observation. I would recommend it to anybody who would like to know something about normal life in modern China, and see how the past and present creates today's Chinese, and you would understand Chinese more."
4,US China-Friendship Volunteers,"Note: for political reasons, the Chinese forbade it to be called the Peace Corp - since it was claimed to be ""in league with the CIA ..."". So instead, it was referred to as ""U.S.-China Friendship Volunteers""The book was great. A good insight into a Chinese communist village. It reminded me a bit of ""Three Cups of Tea"", a little easier read. The major difference being, the Afghanis in the isolated villages seemed less political than the Chinese.The food and restaurants sounded great, but the author had to give up running because the air was so polluted. This is an area flood by Three Rivers Dam, makes you wonder what the water in the reservoir is like."
5,"Epic, Educational, Unparalled",I have listened to many audio books. This one I return too. It is read exquisitly. Clear and engaging. Every few months I check to see if there is a digital version of the audio released as my cassettes are starting to deteriorate. If you come across this grab it and savor it. If you can't then buy the book. It is a compelling read.
4,Great States,Fun easy way for kids to learn the states. My kids love to play this games together and I love thnat they are learning in a fun creative way.
3,Shea Butter spray,Good for shine but the product isn't all natural product for the most part it's a good product. Great shipment
4,Good but not her best,I haven't heard anything mediocre from the artist. It is not in the class of Music Makers and Helen Merill with Clifford Brown as far as musical content and audio quality. Gordon Beck's piano work will keep the listener's attention. I think it's a worthwile recording for my collection that I decided to keep it. The audio quality is somewhere between 7 and 8. It's only vocals and piano which no doubt is a difficult instrument to record with realism.
1,Cheap looking.,"I expected this to look really cool, but it looks cheap. It comes on a cardboard card covered in a plastic sheeth, and Amazon folded the cardboard over before they shipped it. The damaged packaging made it look even crappier. I sent it back."
4,A good series for tween girls,"A nice series for young girls. It is a Christian based book, but honestly, you would never know it. I think some parents may want to see more Christianity represented, however, it was still a very good read and I think it would appeal to most girls in it's target age group."
1,Not satisfied,I was very disappointed to see that all the balloons were orange! I assumed they were different colors since that's what it shows IN the picture! Why would I want all balloons the SAME color? OHHHH I am soooo upset!
3,New work only,"This book is a high school textbook for prospective homebuilders and electricians, not a reference on how to apply the National Electrical Code to residential buildings.It has too many illustrations of things already familiar to homeowners, such as examples of commonly available receptacles, circuit interrupters, and illuminaries (courtesy of xyz corp.), and it makes too many generalizations about what a ""common"" residence will be like, instead of sticking strictly to the letter of the NEC.It might be good for new work, where the person has the freedom to follow new codes, and can redesign the house to follow the new codes and new styles, but for someone who is trying to improve on old work while sticking to the code, this book is a disappointment.Buy this book for new work only."
2,Too many details spoil the fun,The author is too has taken things a bit too far with all the details doled out to the unsuspecting reader. There is not a single likable charater in the book which is digestable. The sex life of Jake has been described in too much detail and I had to skip lot of those parts simply because they were boring. The Bracegirdle letters need not have been written in that horrid old english - again overdoing the authentic bit. Makes the reading so slow and irritating. Looks like the author wants to pass on all the research he has done to the reader. Again that makes the story hard to enjoy.
2,arg...,"The parts where the author spends several pages at a time narrating about his past make me want to scream. Frankly, I don't give a crap about what happened to him in middle school, his sexual exploits in college, the history of his parents, his ex wives, or his friend's ex wives... I've taken to skipping those sections of the book because they are of no relevance to the plot. It doesn't feel like the author has created a character, it just seems he felt like ranting to us about his own personal history."
1,A review of the first 56 pages,"That's because I only managed to slog my way through that many. Phooey on this book. Another author who is paid by the word, not the idea or story telling abilities. Way too many digressions (even the narrator admits to that), and the old manuscript in olde English was a trial as well.Life's too short to spend on books like this."
3,Don't waste you money unless you really need this,"This product is a bit overpriced, and that's an understatement. It does have a lot of cool features, lattest stuff, but you might want to wait until it's a bit older and a lower cost. It's really fast, sometimes too fast. I suggest people who absulatly need this get it, if you jsut think it's cool. Don't buy it"
1,Perloff does it again,"Perloff sets up a strawman with misrepresented facts and hucksterism. I guess since The Ten Commandments failed to include ""Thou shalt not lie"" Perloff somehow thinks he's getting away with something. It's a real shame that humanity as a whole hasn't evolved enough intelligence to see through this transparent tripe. Boo!"
1,more ANTI-scientific junk for creationist true believers.,"Trots out the same old tired, dealt-with, nonpersuasive creationist ""evidence"", and ignores the solid facts that make Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection the essential framework of modern biological science.If you really want to understand the evidence as it stands today, read ""Darwin's Ghost"" instead."
5,Smooth Like Buttah,"Have just listened to ""From The Heart"" by Johnny Adams....what a voice....so smooth...like silk, but with that touch of badness that left me wanting to rip my clothes off! Definitely one of my top 10 albums of all time!"
4,It works,"The instructions are vague on downloading a game and then establishing a phantom drive. It is a blessing not having to run my games off a cd. The instructions could be better, thus only four stars."
2,Buck knife made in china.....,"I get how we outsource, but to me the name buck instills a image of sturdy american made products. this knife how ever is made in China. its quality is poor, the open and closing of it is not fluid to say the least. Im sad to say i will no longer purchase new buck knives. ill just have to wait to inherit my fathers. all and all this is a poorly made product."
1,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yup Amazingly terrible come on now Barnes what the heck are u thinking man oh this is our best cd he says BULLCHIT!!!.I think this is a embarrasment to the whole Death Metal scene it is garbage Barnes you are done man RETIRE please dude.I bet Cannibal Corpse are laughing there A55 off at him i would too and all.I am laughing at all the people giving this 4 and 5 star review's you must not have heard this one it is a poor excuse to go mainstream well i guess it did all the Limp Bizkit fans are probably walking reapeating the phrase in ""Amerika The Brutal"" NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! please.I am done typing about this poor excuse for a cd want real death metal listen to bands like Nile,Immolation,Hate,Vader to name a few.If you want be blown away Listen to Vader REAL MUSIC!."
4,"Pretty good, but not great","The CD is worth the money for sure but nothing to rave about. The lyrics to most of the songs repetitive and kinda lame. The guitars are great, the drums are perfect and the vocals are excellent. The DVD is a nice touch but lacks content. the videos of the band playing are fun to watch once, the interview with Barnes is a chance to watch him roll a joint, then babble for quite sometime. If you are a fan of six feet under or the old days of cannibal corpse then this cd is a must."
3,Good dumb fun...,"This is hardly ""death metal album of the century"" but it's certainly unique and is taking Barnes out of the ""we are just another band"" category. This record is making them stronger as an act, without a doubt. I think that this album has many strong, and catchy numbers while trying to break the typical death metal mode that others have been locked into pointlessly for a lifetime.The lyrics are still Barnes, aside from his stupid attempts at political commentary...don't look to this CD for intelligent thought.Overall, I'd say that this record is well produced, well played (the drumming is vastly improved) and the songwriting unique. Don't look to this for the traditional SFU platter of Obituary meets Sabbath death music or the best of double-bass hammering death-grind but it's an interesting CD and worth a listen."
2,"Not the Clock DVA album ""Thirst""","This is not the album ""Thirst"" by Clock DVA. This is something else...apparently a film score by various artists. It needs to be relisted under ""various artists""."
5,An ongoing book about vampires!!!!,"This book was too long and had too much dragging in it. The book was about a bunch of vampires invading a city,how original. I felt this book lack character, althought its strong point was in content. I just wasn't excited about 256 pages of vampires. The boy named Chet was so very deserving of a oscar. I just think this book is not up to standards for the late 90's moderate teenage reading material."
3,An OK Book,"This book is about a typical teenage boy, who leads a moderatly normal life, untill he finds out he's turing into a vampire. This turns his life upside down. Chris is faced with a difficult new taks, handed on to him by Chet the Celestial Being While doing this however, he must avoid the sexy vampire vixen, Muffy, and the suspicion of his friends and family all the same.My favorite part in the book was just before the end, with the whole Festival of the Sad Vampires. That part to me was full of action and appeal, unfortunatley not like the rest of the book.I really and truly wanted to love this book. I was completly hooked untill the ending. That has got to be one of the worst endings of a book I have ever read. It leaves the main character in doom, wivh I think is a very poor idea. Also, it just ends, with no sign of any climax. I am going to vie this book an ok book and would recomned it for fans of vampire books, but for non-fans of the genre, stay away from it!"
5,Bloody great read!,"Matt Anderson does it again in this Paul Zindel-Meets-Stephen King feast of entertainment. An excellent read even if you're an adult, this marriage of teen angst/young love and horror fantasy is right on target, right up there with Salem's Lot and George Romero's ""Martin."""
3,"A must for HEV enthusiasts, but could've been better...","Dr. Wakefield's second book in a 2-part series on the history of the electric automobile is well-written, well-researched, and an absolute must for anybody who wants to know about hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Unfortunately, this book was a little frustrating because he frequently refers back to his first book, which is very tough to get now (out of print). Also, he dwells heavily on solar cars, and less on more practical HEVs. Nonetheless, Dr. Wakefield is THE authority in the area of EV history, and anyone who wants to know this subject must read this book."
1,BAD,"This video is just bad. From what I remember, it's just pictures that were taken of Geri Halliwell when she was a model. Then they give you the story behind the pictures, and that's it. I would to suggest to anyone who is thinking about buying this video, to not. I'm sure you could download all the pictures on the internet."
5,I Can Do That With My Kid,Excellent book for parents with young children. Examples of how to improve child's math and reading skills as well as developing self esteen makes it very helpful
4,Good text,"Overall it is a good text, Not very big and seemingly brief, but it gets to the point. It is sort of Cell Physiology cliff notes and really is good and giving you what you need and not extra fluff."
4,"Probably includes best-looking version of ""Juno and the Paycock""","This 2-DVD set includes the following films:THE FARMER'S WIFETHE MANXMANJUNO AND THE PAYCOCKTHE SKIN GAMERICH AND STRANGEAlthough the picture on some of these isn't great, this set includes one of the better (though still, sadly, not sharp) transfers of JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK. RICH AND STRANGE doesn't look bad, either. Worth getting for this price, for sure."
5,Loved it! :),I love this movie! :) it is in great quality and i would recommend it if you're from a foreign country. It worked well with my zone free DVD player :) I'm satisfied
3,No Stand By Me.,"Now and Then is a coming-of-age tale following the lives of four pre-teen girls. This film mostly takes place in the past rather than the present, this film should've been called Then and Now. Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman have the best character development and depth. Demi Moore is the only adult character that seems affected by past hurts and trials from her childhood. Melanie Griffith continues to play the bimbo, she is so much smarter than that! Good film but not a home run."
4,This left me wanting more..,"I don't often sit thru' an entire movie without moving at all, but I sat through this whole movie. It was good in that the story was told fluently by the mature acting of the young cast. I think the adult cast merely cameoed. In fact, Rosie O'Donnell and Demi Moore's face looked devoid of emotion most of the time. But the young cast was brilliant. The camaraderie among the four girls was brought out in such an awfully touching manner. A good movie about childhood should be one that leaves the audience wishing people never have to grow up, and this was one of those movies."
5,Great Movie,I love this movie so much!! I remember the first time I saw it. I went with a bunch of my friends when it first came out and we all fell in love with it. It's the best movie. My favorite part is when Devon Sawa asks Christina Ricci if he can kiss her. I thought that was the sweetest thing. Everyone should see this movie.
2,Amateur Video of Beautiful Cars,"Hosts were ignorant. During one interview, they ask if a '29 Ford with a 270 ci engine was capable of 200+ mph. The owner laughed in amazement at such a stupid question. In another, an owner describes his car and engine, and then 20 seconds later the host asks ""What kind of engine is this"". Totally clueless. They're obviously only concerned with 1/4 mile times/mph and cost of build. The video is jerky, and often the microphone isn't passed to whoever's talking. The only saving grace for this dvd is the amateur video of the beautiful hot rods (not just roadsters). If you're still interested try to find used for the price of a fast food meal."
1,useless after the first few months and outdated,I bought this after my twins came home and it was a waste of money. I'm glad I bought it used. My babies just turned 3 months old and there is really no helpful information in the book.
4,"If you have a premature baby, info you need","When a baby is premature and finally gets to leave the hospital, standard baby books and growth charts don't apply. It's nice to have a reference to help guide us in child development that is out of the ""normal"" standards until baby has a chance to catch up. God Bless premature babies everywhere!"
1,Not even Close,"I bought this DVD because I thought like with so many other Japanese movies that the original Manga was as good or better than the cinematic version. NOT EVEN CLOSE. This sucks, it is a boring animation kung fu flick which doesn't hold a candle to Battle Royal.As for the comment of some others here. It might be banned in the US (hooray for the country of freedom) but here (Netherlands) it is sold in almost every record shop en even in some toy shops who also sell DVD and video games and has an Age rating of 16."
3,The live action Rules!,"I agree with maxsixer, if you can find someone with the live action version of Battle Royal, you owe it to yourself to see it! I read about the movie for the first time in Fangoria about 2 and a half years ago. I obtained my first copy in VCD format from an anime convention of all places! Also the book is more detailed and follows more of the characters and differs just slightly from the movie. Either by reading or watching, you most deffinitely owe it to yourself to look into Battle Royal!"
5,stock up!,"I've been using these for the last few years, and have seen them work amazingly well for myself and my family. At the first sneeze or tickle in my throat, I pop one in, then another a couple hours later. I keep doing that until the symptoms are gone, which is suprisingly fast. The sooner you take them the better your results. I honestly don't know how they work as well as they do, but I've taken to stocking up and keeping a bottle everywhere.The best thing about these is that they taste like a chewable vitamin C tablet, or maybe even a bit like a Sweetart candy, which means people are likely to actually take them when they need them, and in the quantity they need. Most children will also eat these. Also, the price is MUCH lower per dose than the competition.I love these, and recommend them all the time. I'm usually not one to believe in stuff in the health food aisle, but this I do."
5,Heaven,"This cd can only be described as heavenly. It blends slow melodic songs like alucinado and tardes negras with catchy beats like perverso.Personally I don't really listen to spanish music but this cd was different. From the first time I heard TzN singing Tardes Negras on the MTV Europe Awards, I knew I had to have it. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Every song on the cd is catchy and it never gets boring. Most people say they play their cd through shuffle because it makes the cd more interesting, but with this cd there is no need for that. So all I can say is buy this cd."
1,The Meaning of Life,"I appreciatte that the author is writing about respect and compassion but I don't understand how anyone can have time to worry so much about another religion let alone another person's chosen beliefs. As a fellow Christian I believe in following our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - and his first commandment was to love one another - not to prove each other wrong. I don't think you need a book like this to tell you how to treat mormoms, catholics, buddists, jews, or any other religion. The Bible already told us how to treat our fellow man - as ourself! Just love them. And don't worry about the rest - that's God's job."
1,Anti Anti Anti! When did Christ teach these principles?,"Most importantly this book is inaccurate. It offers little more than can be found on any anti Mormon site for free! Save your money. I would like to add that it is so disappointing that people spend there time bashing other religions of any denomination. What is guarnateed is that we will all be judged. As much belief as we have in Christ he said 'if ye love me keep my commandments'. There seems to be enough clarity expressed in this statement to justify that we must all try to obey them if we are to profess our love of him who atoned for our sins. Can one imagine meeting him and expressing that ' Oh yes, I broke all of your commandments regularly, but your grace is sufficient for me to allow complete indifference to you. I know I added to the beads of blood from every pore but what does that matter - you can give me your grace'! Good luck to all of those so called followers of Christ who believe the doctrines of men."
5,VEN ENSENAME,"This cd has great music to listen and dance too! I enjoy listening in car and home when doing my house chores. I am a great fan of Super Odisea and I'm trying to get all their albums. I have been lucky to find almost all of them thru Amazon (which are life savers and my best shopping place for music & movies) Thanks, Juani"
2,Good but not too helpful,"This isn't really a bad book it just isn't that helpful in the long run. Requirements (GPA or GRE scores) are missing in most sections, the tuition amount is always outdated. I could see how a book like this was helpful ten years ago but right now I believe the internet is more helpful. All of this information can be found on www.petersons.com for free. Either way if you buy this book you will have to use the internet to get more updated information. Not bad to flip through in the library but not worth the money to buy it."
2,Pick Another One,"Pedometer gets two stars because of unique color and excellent display screen. Otherwise, multiple problems. First, the instructions are printed in such small type had to have son set it up.The buttons used to set personal information are unreadable because function is imbedded into the orange button rather than being a contrasting color. But the biggie is high inaccuracy when you change clothes. With now cooler weather, tucked T-shirt into slacks rather than leaving loose over slacks. Result was a 1,000+ less steps difference on same route, at same cadence speed, for same amount of time! Pick another pedometer."
4,Bangin CD,The first cd in this set is great! The second cd leaves a little to be desired. The first cd has many hard hitting bass thumping songs. But the second cd is more melodic and i would not consider it hard trance. The first cd is worth the price alone.
4,Simple To Use List Approach Works for Me,"I came across this book by accident at the library, and basically read it in one sitting. I have already implemented some of the ideas such as: ""The Brain Dump"", In/Out Tote bag, ziploc bag uses,... She makes organizing easy with the 1000 ideas in list format. There is a ""Resources"" section with weblinks. The ""Simple Sevens for Success"" near the end of the book really narrow down different tasks into manageable steps. I've checked out the digital copy of this book a few times, and finally bought it.If you're looking for a comprehensive index, it doesn't have it. If you're looking for pictures, it doesn't have them. It may not be the ideal, all-encompassing, organizing book everyone needs, but the ideas/strategies are presented so concisely that you can pick and choose what fits your space or your life-style or your ""organizing personality"" to get you started. Recommended."
3,Nothing too original here IMHO,"There may be some gems in amongst the 1000, but with suggestions such as ""label everything,"" and ""program commonly called numbers into speed dial"" prevailing, I wished she had picked out her best 100 and saved readers the time finding them."
5,A LIFE SAVER,MY THREE MONTH OLD WILL NOT BLINK AN EYE WHEN THE TAPE IS ON AND I CAN ACTUALLY GET ALL MY CHORES DONE. HE WILL ACTUALLY SCREAM WHEN THE TAPE ENDS. WE HAVE TO KEEP REWINDING THE TAPE ALL DAY TILL HE FALLS ASLEEP.GET IT !!!! YOU WILL FIND YOU HAVE FREE TIME ON YOUR HANDS!!!
3,Real sleek n shiny ... but not for MEN,"The work done on the bracelet, quality all is great but for some reason this was featured as one of the top seller bracelet for MEN... that gotta be wrong .. its just too flashy. I got it for myself but ended up giving it to my gf ... looks great on her!"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this bracelet as a Christmas gift for my best friend. Based on the reviews, it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price. However, upon receipt of the bracelet, I was so disappointed in its quality that I felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet."
4,I like it,"This is the first time I settled for ""byzantine"" style of jewelry but I like it. It is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes. It would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny."
5,works great,"10 feet working great as a 6 feet, if not better, commercial grade product. highly recommended, lolz, seriuosly."
1,Terrible drive...no support,"Run away from this one. When it works , it works fine, It decides when it will work...Worst drive I have ever had. Wont buy seagate/Maxtor ever again."
1,Terribly unreliable drive,"Like some other reviewers here, I am screwed because of this cheap drive. First, it won't power down or go into a low power state--there is no ""on/off"" switch. You have to unplug it from the wall to turn it off.Worse, although I've had it less than a year, it has started making noises and now won't access my files. My data is LOST."
1,"Does not spin down, noisy","Like the name states, it's basic external storage with no special features. Unfortunetly, the unit does not spin down nor hibernate when the computer is turned off. Use your computer 2hrs./week? This baby keeps going 24/7/365 days/year whether the computer is turned on or not. Yes, it does generate a lot of heat and noise which will ultimately lead to premature failure, and probably why Maxtor only offers a 1-year warranty."
2,Disappointed by it,"I bought eau de toilette first, the same smell but different concentration. That one smelled wonderful-fresh, fruity, floral, but because it was only 1oz and it is not very long lasting, I decided to get a bigger bottle and higher concentration. The shipment was amazing I got it in like a day and a half. But I almost cried when I opened it and made a spritz. It smelled exactly like Chanel #5, so overpowering, so old-lady-ish and it gave me a migraine at once. It was my worst experience buying perfume ever. But I read enough reviews on this perfume and specifically on eau de parfum concentration to know that it should smell ok, fruity and flowery but a little longer lasting. Not like this. I wish there was a way for me to do something about it, because now that I opened it I am stuck with a big bottle of bad perfume and don't know what to do:("
2,paseo 2-dr,"The product was ok but when I called tele # on reverse the tech told me how to program the POD but not where the shut off was for system. ""USUALLY"" it is under the dash. I never found ""shut off switch"" to program unit. All I did was switch ""innerds"" so I could start the car. I bought the car used and who knows who installed alarm. Dave S."
3,Not very rugged.,"This product is sterling silver, but was smaller, lighter and not as solid as I expected. This was a gift for my husband, and the rotating closure was lost within a few months of purchasing it."
5,Incredibly moving in a subtle way. Read it.,"Why this gem has not received the recognition it deserves in the publishing world is impossible to understand. Now available in America; finally. An important testament to the Houlocaust, and, in a larger sense, to humanity... to hope... Sweet & terrible; austere, beautiful, humbling. You will want all of the people you love to read it, too..."
4,The transformation of the day2day into a meaning.,"Weil takes his character Josef Rubicek through budding romance, poverty on the outskirts, danger, demeaning treatment, and the daily effort to survive, in Prague during the Holocaust. Rubicek is slow to understand what is happening around him, but eventually realizes the significance of the regulations that get announced daily, the restrictions that are put on his world, and the anguish of those he encounters. It's a very moving book throughout, even when Rubicek is lost in reveries over a romantic liaison which has been ended by the authorities."
5,One Of The Greatest Sitcoms Ever!,"I've been waiting on Polly Holliday's ""Alice"" to be released on dvd forever! Here's hoping they release all four seasons so we get to see every episode Flo's in!"
2,"""Recordable Media"" Close to Bootleg","A good series being ruined by more greed. They've come to realize that, since fans are desperate to see this stuff, they can get away with highway robbery with dvd-r. Hanna Barbera is doing the same thing with ""Josie And The Pussycats In Outer Space"", among many others. I've drawn the line. For me, packaging is part of the allure of getting a set. Discs with colored art work are a sign that money has been invested. That, along with professional packaging, are what makes me want to get an entire series. I am a collector and I only want the best. Obviously, the shows themselves are what I'm after, but why should I have a negative feeling when I pay good money? All I can think of is , ""this stuff is a bootleg""!"
3,Somewhat TV-movie-ish,"Several story lines merge and overlap in an ensemble cast tale about life and love in S Africa amid the strays of a dog pound. Every time the action flags, you can bet it's time for a cute dog scene. Racial issues darken the vibe towards the end, and it all gets off to a very slow start. But it's worth sticking around for a night of mild entertainment."

4,Must-read,This book helps me to understand and know how to make a good code change after debugging a bug - functionality or performance.
1,Not so good? It's posible?,"I'm surprised with the high Refactoring's Rating. I've read GoF Design Patterns and Fowler Refactoring is not able to reach the experience. Is simplistic, don't give you nothing new on OO programming, and don't have the category to became a classic.Perphaps I'm not a great programmer (who knows...) but the Refactoring's seems a child story. I'm sorry, many people talked amazing things of Fowler UML distilled. Perhaps, but this is not the case.For middle brained, s quarter of programmer, I don't recommend the book. Only if you're interested in something like ""which're the refactorings (intuitive) algorithms to implement in some place"" try it."
2,"Shallow, verbose, and too ambitious","The book attempts to match the Gang of Four book in both format and effect. Unfortunately, it fails. The author spends so many pages explaining trivial refactorings such as renaming a method or introducing a constant. Any software developer with moderate experience would now how and why to perform such tasks without any need for such a book. The book doesn't cover more complex or exotic refactorings that are of greater value to the experienced developer, and it doesn't touch upon the impact that refactoring might introduce into existing code and how to manage and minimize that impact.However, it does contain some useful tips on correcting some classic design mistakes using refactoring, which might prove valuable to the novice. Thus, the two-star rating."
2,"I like it, but it's easily broken....","I like the foot massager but within a few hours of use the glued joints separated. I can re-glue it, but it really needs a means to secure the three base strips together."
4,A must-read for anyone beginning a shift in Paris,"After many weeks working in France, much of the first half of this book was very relatable to my own experience. The next half is less impressive, largely because it becomes less realistic, but still worth skimming through for the one or two good bits.Who would like this book? Anyone who finds it amusing that ""A Year in the Merde"" was translated to ""God Save La France"" to title the French-language version, or any French person wanting to understand an outsider's first impression, although much of the humor may be lost to the latter. I haven't read the French version, but cannot imagine how a translation could do this book any justice."
3,A light (and mostly enjoyable) read,"Before jumping on a plane recently, I picked up A Year in the Merde. As a current expatriate in a French-speaking country, I thought this book might be particularly relevant and funny. I thoroughly enjoyed the first few chapters (broken out by months in the book), but it began to lose my interest less than halfway in. The sharp wit and humor of the first 100 pages seemed to be less frequent and less funny in the remainder. Still somewhat funny, but a bit redundant. It is a light and basically enjoyable read - and not bad by any means - but keep your expectations low and you will not be disappointed."
1,Awful,"I gave up after about page 20. The author has little writing talent, I'd say, and tries to be funny, but isn't. I agree with all of the negative comments on Amazon. Glad I borrowed it from the library. A waste of time and money."
3,A Good Light Read,"This is a fictitious account of Paul West's Year - well 9 months - in Paris. Although it is a novel it is a true account of life in Paris. It is an entertaining pastiche of the best selling A Year in Provence and other such books extolling life in a different culture. The writers love/hate/infuriated relationship with the french is very well written. There are many laugh out loud moments including his afternoon with a Parisian estate agent and his efforts to motivate his less than enthusiastic team about his project to develop Tea shops across France.This is a lively, fast moving story which can be finished in a couple of sittings. It is not going to influence anybody's view of France of the French. That is not the writer's intention. It is an excellent, light, read. I actually read it in France which gave in an extra je ne sais quoi!"
2,mimosa,"This fragrance was based on a drink , and not the tree. I will not buy it again. But Philosphy has always been my only product i have been able to use on with my skin"
2,does not smell like cake,I'm glad I didn't purchase this bottle - I just received the free small bottle from Sephora. I just wanted to warn people that this does not smell like vanilla or birthday cake to me at all. It almost smells like cigarette smoke or plastic.
1,Going back to the previous edition,"It's hard to imagine how fast this product has gone down hill from the previous versions. You can't get rid of the logos on the back page without having to almost start the card from scratch, the links on the help panels go to dead pages, when you do track down what is left of the support site for Sierra, there is nothing in the knowledge base for this edition, and clicking on the link for additional customer support gets yet another dead web page. This edition is extremely disappointing. I won't buy another until this restrition is removed."
4,CardStudio2003Deluxe,I was very happy with the upgrades to this program. The art work was easy to use and I would recommend it to my friends. It is much improved over the other Hallmark versions.
3,Didn't like it too much.,"Too much talking about ""exploring your sensuality"" I'm not exactly into all the skyclad stuff. It was usefull but not as much as I thought."
5,EXCELLANT!!!,"I feel that this book is an excellent source of information for the ""beginner"" who is unsure of whether to become a Coven member or to stay Solitary. It also gives a wealth of information about the Esbats and Sabbats for those who want to celebrate them. I would deffinaely recommend this book to those who have questions on which way to go (Coven or Solitary)."
4,Helpful but missing something...,"I found this book to be a good resource when planning a local group here. A few things more I would have liked to see were regarding group ideas for activities, new coven ""drama"" dynamics, and ideas for family covens. The crafting she describes seems to be geared towards more traditional lines... and seems to require a core group hat is starting everything.It does offer excellent advice on classes and worksop ideas, as well as general group dynamics and adaptation as you grow.I would say it is ideal for a small group of practioners who are looking to grow or branch out."
3,Seat riser,"Easy to install, parts all snapped together with a good fit. I like the hinged seat, makes it easy to clean. No issues so far."
2,"NOT AS DESCRIBED, ONLY 3 INCHES HIGH",THIS SEAT IS ONLY 3 INCHES HIGH. I MEASURED IT ON ALL SIDES AND EACH SIDE IS ONLY 3 INCHES. THE ROUND SEAT FITS PERFECTLY INSIDE MY TOILET BOWL BUT IS MORE THAN AN INCH SHORTER THAN THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOWL ALL AROUND THE FRONT. I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT MAKES THE TOILET LOOK. I HAD HOPED THAT IT WOULD APPEAR MORE LIKE A TALLER TOILET RATHER THAN AN OBVIOUS EXTENSION.I GUESS IT DID SAVE ME REPLACING THE TOILET UNTIL LATER. I LIKE THE LIP ON THE INSIDE FRONT THAT PREVENTS SPILLAGE. IT IS EASY TO CLEAN. I DO CLEAN TOILET MORE OFTEN NOW WITH ELEVATED SEAT.JUST BE AWAFE THAT THIS SEAT IS - NOT - 4 INCHES ONLY 3 INCHES
5,Great game!,"I used to love to play this game a child, and it is still just as much fun! The levels are still somewhat challenging even now! Great game for kids in second or third grade and up, definitely helpful with problem solving and logic skills."
5,Love it!,I'm not sure that i would have bought this at the retail price of $800+ only because it would have been out of my budget. This pot filler is awesome! It's my favorite part of the kitchen.
1,Cheyenne Warrior,To whomever wrote the first review...too bad you ruined it for us by revealing the ending.
4,stylus,"Small, fits in pocket well, works great. no need for a large cumbersome stylus. I would reccommend to a friend. BoxWave mini Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus (Lunar Blue)"
2,Bruno Mattei's White Apache,"Bruno Mattei, the director of this film, despite the pseudonym of ""Vincent Dawn,"" is little known in the US except among cult followers. His film work, including Italian-made ""B"" cult films, are characteriscally violent, gory with homoerotic elements. Many of his films do not identify him as the director and some use pseudonyms. This film--White Apache--is a ""contemporary"" western about a white boy who grows up among Apache indians and, upon adulthood, returns to ""civilization,"" a small cowboy ""shoot-em-up"" town with one street (low budget film) and eventually has an affair with a local woman of ill repute. Upon hearing about an attack on his Apache family, he engages in outrage against the white population, who respond in kind against him and so on...you get the picture. I would describe the film as mildly viewable except among genre fans."
3,Hmmm..,"When I heard the opening couple of tracks I was blown away, but after that it started sounding really formulaic. I got bored. It is basically just British-influenced prog-rock (it probably is British, I didn't look...it has Bruford and Hackett on it, so that's probably an indicator). I think it's in fact some of the guys from the current King Crimson band, but it lacks the immediacy of Fripp's influence I suppose. It is certainly well performed but pretty time-worn stuff. If you want to hear the real thing check out old Gentle Giant, King Crimson, PFM, Genesis (the original Genesis, not the Phil Collins pop project), ELP, etc."
5,Technical and Beautiful Music,"A mixture of Jazz, Rock, Metal, World, Ambient, and Classical music combine with talented people and you have Gordian Knot. All players are top-notch, and Malone as head composer, makes it all work and make sense."
2,Very weak compared to Ringworld or other early works,"The book deals with the conflicts between the moon people who are destined to die as the moon becomes airless, and the space people who are immortal and plan to go on to another star when the fuel project for which the moon was built is completed. We are used to conflicts between groups of people, but in this case the moon people are the children of the space people. Can you imagine raising a child to do your work and then to be abandoned to die? I could not suspend my disbelief that far."
3,A fair space opera.,"I didn't think this novel was anything special, its not a strong page turner, I was able to put it down for a day or two with no problem but I did enjoy the story."
1,Didn't like (breathe) this (breathe) book.,"I didn't recognize much of Niven's writing style in this novel. That said, I found the writing to be dull, uninspiring and just plain bad. The characters are poorly developed and the science secondary to poorly played out human drama."
3,"Great Story, Seriously Flawed","This has the potential to be a fine story, but it never will be. Some characters are well defined, some make little sense. Some plot lines work, others we're just asked to believe in though the story doesn't support them. So one is left with the experience of charging through really neat, compelling stuff to be brought up short by ill-contrived nonsense over and over. Really sad, because it's too good to abandon but never satisfactory."
5,An unknown master of the short story,"Breece Pancake is the best short story writer that you've never heard of. His tales of modern West Virginia life are good the way Hemingway's work is good, or Raymond Carver's. Pancake has things to say and he says them with authority, style and grace. This is an outstanding collection."
4,stories of greece d'j pancake,THIS PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND FULFILLED MY EXPECTATIONS. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED. AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED BY THIS REVIEWER.
4,Can I Make It 4 and a half?,"I love the song! Who put the doggie in the dog house? You did baby, you did....It's a pretty cool song, though I never heard of them since the old MTV days. Now I hear them on MuchMusic, and the song is really catchy! See you later."
5,United We Stand: Songs for America,This is a great CD to have playing in the background at a 4th of July party. It puts everyone in a festive mood. You will often find yourself singing along. A great variety of singers.
2,"A sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating food guide","This beautifully laid-out book has interesting information about caviar, oysters, and other gourmet treats. I've learned a lot about, and gained respect, for many culinary creations that I previously knew very little about. However, it is also dispiriting. For example, I am now discouraged from eating any American Oysters(according to Mr. Rosengarten, the only good ones are from France), and his chapter on Pecan Pie, betrays a palate that is maybe a little narrow and judgemental. In short, althought very informative, ""Taste"" left me with a bitter taste in my mouth."
2,Money maker,"This review gives ""The Best Of Bob Dylan"" two stars based only on the packaging efforts by the record company. The songs included on this album are, individually, excellent samples of a marvelous songwriter and poet. However, as a collection this album doesn't really work. The avid Dylan fan already owns all of the songs in this collection in a much more natural state (i.e. the original albums on which they were included). For someone attempting to discover the art of Dylan, I would recommend his 1965 album ""Bringing It All Back Home."" That album is a perfect blend of where Dylan had been early in his career and where he was going. I cannot put any kind of musical labels on Dylan's work (like folk or folk-rock), as I feel he has defied the barriers of labels throughout his massive career. Simply put, if you like ""Bringing It All Back Home,"" you like Dylan. Start there."
4,Best live Mingus that I've heard,"Charles Mingus takes a quintet (plus Bud Powell on one song) through a top-notch set on this CD. The band is on fire pretty much throughout. The only exception is ""What Love?"" which I don't like as much as the others. Ted Curson plays his heart out on trumpet, Eric Dolphy is his usual off-center self, and Booker Ervin is good form. Bud Powell doesn't just sit in on ""I'll Remember April"", his long solo is the centerpiece of the song. ""Folk Forms"" ends with yells and saxes sounding like Indian war calls. I'm sure the ""Better Git Hit"", the closer, had the audience rolling down the aisle speaking in tongues (or at least in French).Any Mingus fan should buy this CD. Maybe the only two better are ""Mingus Ah Um"" and ""Blues & Roots"". They were recorded in 1959, this was recorded in 1960 - it was obviously a high point in his career."
5,One of the best books on financial analysis,"I am in the financial services field and a self learner, too. I wanted this book for my business library and to help me brush up on financial analysis. This book did not disappoint me. It is very well written, although I would recommend a newer edition."
1,THIS BOOK IS RUBBISH-DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!,"Since I haved started using computers I have always used the FOR DUMMIES books and have found them excellent. I have built my company's web site with these books, and have become quite computer literate with the books. This book was a big disappointment.It was FULL of mistakes. The CD did not run because of duplicate names, the figures in the book did not match the caption. The instructions were full of errors. It took me ages to figure out the errors by myself. When you are trying to learn a new programme you do not want to be more confused by errors in a book that is supposed to help you.It has put me off buying anymore dummie books."
2,Pretty blocks,"The blocks are pretty, but a 18 month old bores of it quickly. Might be better for the younger ones."
4,Interesting and Eco-Friendly!,"I really like these blocks. I received them as a shower gift. They are very interesting as far as blocks go and I like that they are eco-friendly. I'm not a big fan of plastic toys, so these are great! I like how they have different colors and different sounds. It is convenient that the blocks all fit inside the wooden case. I don't know how my girls will like them since they aren't here yet, but I'm sure they will find these fascinating. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there were more than just 6 blocks. Otherwise, really neat toy!"
4,Good Blocks,We got these blocks for our six month old. She likes them a lot! The smaller ones are easier for her to hold right now but she will shake them around and she tends to chew on them. We got these to add to our collection of wooden blocks so that hopefully when she is older she will be able to continue to have fun with them and build neat things.I would highly recommend these!
2,Broken storage box,"My child got this toy for a 2011 Christmas present, he especially liked playing with the lid on the storage box. Unfortunately the glue that holds the box together does not hold and it separated at the seams, so no more playing or storing with that. The picture now shows screws, ours did not have screws so maybe we got an older version.Like another reviewer said the transparent colors are pretty dark so you can really only see through three out of six. We still play with the blocks as shakers but, we are sad about the storage box breaking after only a month and hope that the blocks don't come apart as well."
1,Won't play,This disc is a European version? Didn't know that when we bought it so it did not work in our DVD player. Bummer.
5,The Benchwarmers,"The Benchwarmers, perfect DVD! Thanks for selling the DVD, I will definitely use your site to buy more! Sent good to the owner."
2,The Benchwarmers,Not my type of humor. I think I'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining.
1,Disgusting,"I went to see this because I like Jon Heder and Rob Schneider, but boy was I disappointed. There is nothing in this film except gross references to every bodily function and fluid there is. Encourages kids to ring doorbells and run, destroy mailboxes, have no work ethic and basically be as crude as possible. It was filthy and repulsive."
4,Interesting and different.,"This was an interesting book, but not quite what I expected. About 75% of the book is devoted to text and photos of twin-engined bombers AFTER they have been retired from active service, i.e., as restored ""warbirds"". There is a useful (but short) review of each plane during its service in WWII, followed by how some were saved and restored, with some breathtaking color photos of the restoration, most in flight.Although this was not what I was expecting (a straight history of these bombers in the war), I still enjoyed reading the book and learned quite a bit from it. The text is well-written and the photos, as noted, were strking.Perhaps the most interesting part of the book were the descriptions and photos of a recreation of Doolittle's 1942 Tokyo raid, this time in the 1990's using two restored B-25's flying off the carrier Ranger. I have no idea this had occurred and really enjoyed reading about that.All in all, a nice addition to a WWII flying buff's library."
2,Poor QC,"This is the second Irwin guide I have purchased and the basic design is pretty good. Unfortunately, this one was horribly inaccurate - the laser line was at least 1/8"" away from the cut line. Thankfully, I was able to get the original working again and plan to return the new one."
5,Great price--no problems with fit,"We priced this replacement part at Sears and it would have been over $[...] with shipping. We were a little worried that this ""non-Sears"" part might not be compatible, but we had no problem installing it and it worked perfectly. At one-third the price it was a great deal."
3,"Great idea, but not as great as it claims","It's a novel idea - put a laser beam in the arbor washer. It turns on/off with the saw, and shines down the edge of the blade onto your workpiece. Not bad for a first-generation idea, but it needs improvement:* The mounting hole is much larger than the bolts, so getting the part (which is solid & heavy) on-center to keep the blade balanced is sheer luck.* The beam is very sharp, but it's also very dim. Hard to see in normal shop lighting. They should make do with shorter battery life (3 button cells) and use a brighter laser.* Dispite Irwin's claims, it doesn't work on the very popular DeWalt DW705 12"" compound miter - the part isn't tapered on top, so it grinds against the pivot joint for the blade guard.I would have kept mine anyway, but with a DW705 it's sadly not possible."
4,Worked for me,"A lot of the negatives here are true, however you can compensate for them. It fit right on my cheap no-name brand 10"" compound miter saw (that I am using to build a large addition to my house). Yeah, the laser is off to the left a little, you line up the laser to touch the left of your measuring mark, and you'll cut the mark with a thin kerf blade. Want to cut to the right of the mark? Line the laser up on the mark. I'm sure you get the idea. Not rocket science.Better than the alternatives, up and down and up and down. And for the price? Good deal and IMHO good product. Good, not great."
1,Does not fit makita LS1214,"I bought this item & thought it will fit my makita ls1214 saw, after many tries to fit , the laser projected inside guards, and the outer label scratch whith the guard, it is also little thick that it wobble and produce strange sound, but it comes with a nice wallet! i will use it to store other things later."
2,Accuracy is terrible,"I rated this item low because it's accuracy is terrible. It was easily installed and we did follow directions provided. The product turned on as it advised, but the laser was more than a 1/16th of an inch. Woodworking, as the manufacturer should know, requires much more accuracy. I called and advised this issue and was told that this was within its accuracy range. UNACCEPTABLE. I asked if it was adjustable and was advised it was not and the representative told me again that it was within its tolerance range. Poor customer service--lack of knowledge.I wouldn't even recommend this unit to a begining woodworker."
5,Excellent Wheel Locks,Very happy with these at 1/3 the price of OEM. Just don't trust their application guide nor their customer service reps for help. Remove a wheel bolt from your car and physically measure its length along with the type of seat it has. Then go into their product listings and select the same wheel-lock bolts from their list that match.
4,Funkify your life a little,"As always, George Porter, Jr. produces cool, sophisticated, and funky sounds. The sly and earthy ""Runnin' Partner"" and ""Rough Spots"" stand out, and ""I Wish"" is one of the more poignant ""On The Road"" songs I've heard.Porter's virtuosity on the bass is unparalleled, so far as I know, and this isn't as well show-cased with a larger band like the Runnin' Pardners as it is in a smaller group. Too bad, but the band is pretty awesome, also.How Porter can be a Funky Meter, an Original Meter, a Runnin' Pardner, and George Porter, Jr., all at the same time, is a mystery, but it does mean that he works a lot and residents of the Crescent City are lucky enough to get to see and hear him a lot. This album might be the next best thing."
5,Might be his best cd yet! Go Joe!,This cd is great! Every song on it good. This I think is his best cd yet! It is definitely worth buying. It's one of those cd's you can actually listen to all the way through without having to skip over any songs. Go get it if you don't have it!
4,Consistency is the word,"Joe's new album doesn't fail to show that Joe still leads the way in smooth tunes. His voice is still just as rich and soulful as it's ever been. This album is admittedly not as noticeable as his previous with particular tracks standing out, but this album does have overall great flow. His music isn't as catchy as previous but that doesn't take back from the cohesiveness of the music. There isn't one particular song that is what I would call, abysmal.Personally I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any smooth, easy listening."
2,"JOE, NOW YOU KNOW BETTER!!!!!","Joe is not knew to the game he has been around to long now ....your style has not changed since the first album you dropped...he is to comfortable and he is not trying to cover new ground..First the lyrics are childish and ghetto...Joe your passed that now time for new fresh ground... in other words up your talent... discover new ground.... these songs sounds the same as the last couple of albums... and you have a voice that should be singing songs of substance... not songs in the back of the ""JEEP""Dont look for Joe to be selling millions of copies of this album cause its the same ol Joe and its simply tired...... Even Joe is getting bored with his style..... look at the title of the album..... he should have titled it "" The Past"""
5,LOVING JOE,"JOE ALWAYS GIVES 100% SATIFACTION. WHEN I WATCH HIM ON VIDEO; IT'S NEVERENOUGH. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF WATCHING HIM MOVE , WHAT HE WEARS. AND OFCOURSE I ALWAYS WONDER HOW HE SMELLS. HE LOOKS LIKE HE SMELLS GOOD. HISVOICE AND DELIVERY IS MAGICAL. HE'S JUST SO SMOOTH,AND PERFECT EYE CANDY.I HAVE HIM ON REPEAT IN THE CAR. HE MAKES ME FEEL GOOD WHEN I LISTEN TO HIM IN THE CAR ON MY WAY TO WORK. I HAVE A BETTER ATTITUDE WHEN I START THE DAY WITH JOE. YOU GO GUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOSH"
4,"Excellent for working out, but ...","I only wish they had a 9"" inseam. They tend to ride up quite a bit. Other than that they are excellent for working out. They keep you cool."
1,Good but EXPENSIVE print,"The print quality is good but the printing cost is very expensive. After new cartridge installation, I can usually print out 30-40 papers. This means the printing cost is about $1 per print (one 92 + one 93 cartriges cost about $40). You might be able to use Kinko with better print quality and at less cost."
2,Ink cartridge issue,It worked very well until it would reject my ink cartriges half way through their use. It would all of a sudden say they were not the correct cartridge. This equated to a very high cost in ink so I just quit using it.
1,No need to buy expensive cartridges,Never buy replacement cartridges because the printer won't last that long. Mine quit before it ran out of ink. No more HP stuff for me.
5,Super Service!,The size I ordered turned out to be too small. I contacted the company and they sent out a free return label. The new size was received sooner than expected. I couldn 't ask for better customer service. No extra expense or trouble to make the return. I merely attached the free UPS return label to the original box and dropped it off at a UPS store without having to deal with even the clerk at the store.
4,Perfect for the price,"This was needed asap, but was very expensive at book stores.A co-worker told me to check amazon.com for books. I wasnt sure if I should risk buying it on-line, but it was cheap so I did. To my surprise the description matched the book perfectly. I and my husband (for whom the book was for) were very pleased."
2,Watch out!!! This DVD edited. Many scenes missing.,"Even though The Human Tornado is undoubtedly Rudy Ray Moore's Citizen Kain, this DVD is completely butchered. Xenon's DVD is missing more then 10 minutes of footage, most of which are some of the funniest gags in the entire film. Unfortantly, there is no other way to get the complete film unless you can find a copy at your local video store that is at least 15 years old, before Xenon edited the hell out of the film. Either way, the transfer and sound on this DVD is beautiful and crisp and the menus are funny and inventive. If you have to buy any copy, buy this one but write Xenon and demand an unedited verson be put out in the future, this time with a commentary track from Rudy Ray Moore."
5,move over and let me pass 'fore I stick these hush puppies..,"Dolemite... a ghetto hero that can roll down a hill without any clothes on and jump in the getaway car fully dressed! He can jump twenty feet in the air and kick twenty of the sheriff's men with a human tornado kick. Indescribable for those who have not seen the movie...dolemite, you heard me."
5,Just as good the second time around,"who can forget the instant replay, or the bathroom scene or anything. Dolemite is a legend and Rudy Ray Moore and I need to go to Roscoe's together."
3,Satisfactory,"Comes in a bunch of pieces but wasn't too difficult for my husband and his dad to put together. It's held up well for the two years we've had it. We recently moved and it survived. Some of the pieces are flimsier than I'd like and looked like they might get damaged in the move but the bed is together and doing well. We had a platform bed from Seaman's before this and it was not built as sturdy as this one. For the price, this is a good bed. One thing to note, though, the edges on the footboard are sharp. You may need to file down the wood."
2,cumbersome and not impressive tambourine,"Was not really impressed with this product. Cannot be cleaned at all because the little metal cymbols stain with the slightest bit of moisture. The petal holes above the cymbols inside are too tempting for kids (and their little siblings) to poke and hurt their fingers. It makes a loud sound, but rattles too much to make a decisive beat and teach anything about rhythm. It is now relegated to a toy bin, where it is generally ignored, because it's not much fun. The metal and plastic do seemed to be joined well, and it is solidly made, so there is some durability to it."
5,One problem w/ the book,"I LOVE IT! Suspenseful, well-written, and exciting! One problem: It should have concluded on the Luthor story line with some curious words from Lex about how Clark saved the day (once again) or a parting put-down from Lionel towards Lex. Regardless, I think you'll enjoy it."
5,Nice Toy!,Hours of endless play awaits the trian connisseur! I bought this for Christmas for my grandsons who are gaga on anything to do with trains. You couldn't separate them from it.
5,So. Much. Fun!,"I purchased this wind-up train for our daughters. They LOVE it.Truth be told, so do I.It is a simple and very attractive wind up toy that gets good distance after winding.The neatest aspects of this toy are the hinges. They allow the train to continue forward movement even when it encounters obstacles. When the train hits a wall or other solid object, it usually glances off and continues on it's merry way.The key is not permanently attached, but we just put it on a long string so that it was always easily spotted wherever the girls leave it.Super fun!!!!!!!"
2,So-So product,If you're going to continue smoking this may be to some help but they are cumbersome in so many way.
2,Pinhead,"I was very disappointed. The holder is too narrow for slim cigarettes and they don't mention that anywhere in the ad. I have to hold the cigarette in place with my other hand. However, it does take out a lot of the tar, so I guess if they fix the problem it might be a great product."
3,ok,this is exactly what it says it is. IF you want to see how gross the stuff you are inhaling is use the clear filter. If you don't want to see it use the black one. arrived on time with no issues.
2,TarGard Permanent Filter System,I am disappointed that these filters remove only the smallest amount of tar from my cigarettes. A friend also bought me the Original Disposable Cigarette Filters by TarGard and they are just as inadequete as the Permanent filters. I do not recommemnd these.
4,Good but limited coarse,"Quality pepper mill; in fact, it's the smoothest I've used. You can't get a very coarse grind using the thing like for a poivre but if you're looking for a somewhat coarse to fine you can't get any better."
3,Atlas grinder,"Products bottom was cupped where the bottom would not seat flat causing it to rock slightly on the counter. Also I would like be able to adjust to a courser grind. No matter how you adjust the bottom screw pepper comes out the same which is fairly fine pepper grinds. I must say though, the unit is very nice looking."
4,Slackware Linux Released: Very Comprehensive,"Slackware Linux Release is a very comprehensive book covering much of the topic. I thought it was an exceptional book! I successfully installed in an older X386 33MHz machine. Initial install isn't exactly automatic but is manageable for one with reasonable computer skills. Book not only covers basics but is also good for intermediate use and as a general UNIX reference. Browsing through other books on the topic, I would strongly recommend this book as well as the Slackware distribution of Linux that comes with it."
3,Not very good for beginners,"The book's best point was the copy of Linux that came with it. There wasn't too much there as far as teaching you how to use Linux unless you already had a bit of knowlege of Unix/Linux Commands. On a positve side, the last few chapters about network programming in C were quite helpful to a beginner in that area..."
3,The Book is Not Worth the Extra Charge!,"I own a copy of this book. I got the book at my local pathmark store for fifteen percent off. The book was over rated. Those of you who still watn the book, there are still many copies of it in the East Brunswick, NJ Pathmark on route 18. The book was good, though, I espacially like the part when Zeck duels with Jacia. It was really cool when the Great Temple blew up also! The Book was good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Be aware if your a Luke fan..,"Although the books were really good (I've got the whole series), I was dissepointed to find that Luke Skywalker only made guest appearences, and was somehow wiped completely out of the picture in almost every book. So, if you like to be refreshed with new characters but the same general background idea (jedi knighting for good and justice) then these are the perfect books for you. But beware if youre a Luke fan..."
3,nice - but a bit too weird for me,It is a pretty good show but a bit too weird for me at times.the acting was good and it sure has alot of fun moments.
5,WORTH EVERY MINUTE OF WATCHING,"This show starts off slow......but believe me, it picks up speed. The twists and intrigue......are well worth spending time watching.If you love Nip/Tuck......or Rescue Me...give this a watch."
3,Mixed feelings,An original plot and pretty convincing settings is marred by one-dimesional characters and cheesy dialogue. Giving historical characters contemporary sensibilities in order to make the modern reader like them really diminishes the realism. The 'baddies' are normally identifiable by some physical defect.
2,The doctor kit that needs to visit the doctor,"We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas 2006. The kit really is cute and she plays with it all the time. BUT... The doctor's bag that it comes with broke, one of the two plastic handles cracked off (so I had to reattach it with band aides, since it had a boo-boo). There also isn't enough room to fit all the pieces in at the same time. The blood pressure cuff had never stayed together, it was even apart when we opened the box on Christmas morning. The stethoscope doesn't fit, the ear piece part doesn't fit under her chin, so she has to wear it over her face. The stethoscope also makes sounds (heart beat and coughing) but the batteries only last about 2-3 days and I need to buy new ones."
4,Fun and educational,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this kit. She has fun giving all her toys exams as well as her friends and her parents. It helps her to understand what to expect at her doctor's visits. The only problem is that once everything is out of the case, it is hard to get it all to fit in there again. But that is the only negative. It is a great toy."
1,Breaks easily & is not toddler-friendly,"This set was a big hit with my three-year-old, but as others mentioned, the quality is rather poor. I agree with the complaints about the case itself: it is not toddler friendly! We are teaching our kids to clean up after themselves, and they cannot get the items back in the case. The adults barely can! The tube broke off the stethoscope literally within minutes--and from simple ordinary use!--and it cannot be re-attached. So from the first, we were down one toy, and the cuff looks to be the same quality, so I don't expect it to last. Overall, I wish I'd chosen a different kit; it certainly wasn't worth the price tag."
2,OK set but I would not reccomend,"The stethescope barely fits even on little heads and won't stay on so it has to be held. The plastic carry case it all goes in is barely big enough and the handle/covers keep falling off so I had to reattach them with duct tape. Blood pressure cuff keeps falling apartI did not mind my kid getting this as a present, but I am gald I did not pay MY money for such a poorly built toy and I cannot reccomend it."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This product was very cheesy and cheap, I could have gotten something at the dollar store that would have been better. I was and still am thoroughly disappointed. Booooooooo!!!! This is the first really bad review I have ever HAD to write. Don't buy this unless it's at a yard sale."
5,Great cleaning product,This is a great cleaning product. The spray is either spread or concentrated which is nice for different types of stains. It takes the smell out when cleaning up dog accidents.
3,car kit,"the design is good, but the suction cup does not hold for very long. Needs better anchoring for dash mounts. Otherwise, a good product."
3,Tough to open,"Quality and sharpness were great on this knife but for some reason the knife is hard to open with my right thumb. It sticks closed. Opens ok with two hands or my left thumb so it must be the way the pressure is applied on one side. Since I'm right handed, it pretty inconvenient."
4,sunto A-10 compass,I bought these compasses for my webelos cub scout troop. I wanted something simple and durable to use. We are using them for map orienting. They work fine for this use. They are basically indestructable as not a single one has broken despite being in the hands of a group of 10 year olds.
1,Not worth the money,"My nine month old female lab puppy has a box of toys. I thought this would be a great addition. She could hardly get her mouth around the ball so I thought great, she can play with this one. I left her with it for five minutes, looked down and she had just about removed the squeeky part and already tore the rubber around the squeeky insert. For $8 dollars, I thought it would be stronger. I don't recommend this toy as it requires constant supervision. I'm not sure what it's good for since they can't chew on it and it's too heavy to play with like a ball. What a disappointment. Also, while an ugly blue color was shown in the ad, it showed up in an even uglier peptobismol pink. The ad does say colors vary."
2,Not very tough,My 55 pound American Bulldog mix loved this for the hour that it lasted before she was able to crack the rubber and start to pull it apart. Not a toy for strong chewers!
1,Don't choke your dog.,Toy good at first. Squeaker can be pushed into ball and if pulled back out and glued it will crack and the dog can work the pieces loose. Don't let this happen. Had to take it away because I was worried she would swallow the pieces from the squeaker and choke.
2,This will help out people without the manual,"I didnt have the manual for this product and was about to toss it. It is that un-intuitive. But.. my co-worker found the manual. For people struggling with this sucker, hold down the 'set' button for 3 seconds to access the main setup options. After setting the time, then setup the on-off timers the same way."
2,"Hard to set, unreliable","This timer was just the thing I needed in theory. Grounded outlet, flexible schedules, battery backup, no frills. The first problem I had was that it was not intuitive to set the time or schedules. Don't lose the instructions or you'll have a hard time setting it again. But the biggest problem is that every week or two it spontaeously clears its memory. Time and schedules are just gone. That unreliability makes it pretty worthless to me."
2,"These ""chillers"" weren't released from the vault, they escaped!","BRAIN DAMAGE FILMS. Ever hear of 'em? I'm told this shoestring indie outfit used to be pretty good. Judging by this icky triple play, that assessment may be wildly exaggerated.So, do you want badly made gorefests? REALLY bad ones? I mean like: ""why am I watching this junk"" bad? If so, RAZOR's FEAR FILES is just what you've been looking for!.Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll ratings.(2.2) Blood Sisters (2003) - Phoebe Dollar/Erica Howard/Kerry Liu(2.0) Evil Unleashed (2003) - Serena Morales/Heather Chase/Perrine Moore/Jelani Gibson(4.0) Bloody Tease (2004) - Steve Beaumont Jones/Dan Wells/Michael Sharp/Elma Madis"
4,Great fun but suction cups on spoons break off,My 5 year old received this as a birthday present and it has been a lot of fun for his age all the way up to grandparents. I liked it so much I bought it as a Christmas present for my niece and nephew. The one down side is that the suction cups break off the end of the spoons because the kids get a little rough with them.
3,Could have been much better,"This film held my interest throughout its one and a half hours. I am not sure that it would hold the interest of someone who wasn't a fan of mixed martial arts (MMA).Some of the elements needed for a great documentary were in the film - close, gritty footage of Mark Kerr in some of his darkest moments, access to some of the most important people in his life, footage from his training and fights - but what was missing was a good narrator or expert commentator.The shaky camera footage, quick cuts, blood-red filters used during some of the fight scenes, heavily edited fights, and the dubbed-in cheering will not satisfy MMA fans, and will only serve to disgust and upset people who have never seen a real Pride fighting tournament.If you are an MMA fan, you will find this film worth watching. If you are not, you should watch a few tournaments before watching this film."
3,should be good,bob marly is kool so this should be good right?yeah so i guess you should get if if u are a bob marly fan and u are arent u?peace out.
2,"BLONDIE Doesn't Need To Be Remixed, Remade or Remodeled","These remixed versions of Blondie's hits sounded dated when they came out two decades ago, and time hasn't helped them age. One of the cool things about Blondie is that their music was just as welcome on a rock radio station as it was in the dance clubs - not an easy tightrope for any artist to walk but one that Blondie pulled off rather well. These remixed versions wouldn't be welcome many places. They kind of suck. But its still Blondie so I gave it 2 stars."
3,Tragic,"I like Blondie - not old enough to remember them well the first time, but I'm still a fan. This remix disc has a few good dance tracks that blend the mid-nineties dance formula with the original song. However, for the most part, this CD's remixes seem to follow the unsettling trend where whomever mixes/produces the remix does not seem to have actually listened to the original track before slapping on the new beat and effects - and this inharmonious, discordant result is the proof."
5,Nice bag,Contemporary styling. Sturdy construction. Big enough for a standard mat with just enough room left inside for an extra t shirt. Will not fit oversize mats!
4,More room,"I really do like this bag, the only bad thing about it is that I'm really tall so I needed a really long mat and I have to shove to get the mat in there and pull damnded hard to get it out again. So a bit more room in the bag, also I have no room to put my stuff like my yoga pants and towel."
5,pocket knife,It is very high quality and the second small blade come in handy. It is small and light weight in the pocket.
2,"Chinese ""Buck"" knock-off","I guess I expected a real Buck knife now made in their plant in Idaho. Instead, I received a Chinese version which gets dull very quickly. The price was cheap, so ultimately ""I got what I paid for""...."
4,Buck knife,The knife was smaller than I thought it would be. It was as described however and in great shape and fit my grandsons hand. Nice little first knife
5,Fun,"I have read all the books this author has published and have enjoyed all of them. Harrison's books are a nice mixture of dark fantasy, fun, sexual tension and good plot. *note if you can get to a book signing the author is a very pleasent/fun person*I recommend all of Ms. Harrisons books"
5,This series just gets better.,"I described Dead Witch Walking as ""a good start to a new series in the Hamilton, Harris mould"". Fortunately the promise of the first volume has been more than delivered. The characters are all developing nicely, the story thread about the elves is being gradually revealed and Rachel Mariana Morgan manages to stay alive despite the attempts of some extremely powerful enemies. Fortunately she does this through luck and wits rather than Anita Blakes continued acquisition of superpowers. She also manages to avoid bedding every eligible, or ineligible male in site. The end result is that Kim Harrison has quickly gone to the head of the class in this genre of fiction. Charlaine Harris will need to be careful and Laurell Hamilton will need to raise her game considerably if she isn't to be left behind. There's a new kid on the block, her name's Kim and she's taking no prisoners."
3,Great Concept but....,"I love the concept behind this series but, it seems to me that Rachel just gets dumber by the minute. How many deals can one person make with demons. It seems that she never thinks about the consequences of her actions. She only deals with the aftermath of what she has done after the fact.I am not even going to comment on the ""Ivy"" factor. I feel bad for her and I don't think that Rachel takes into account her feelings or how the way she flaunts her ""male"" relationships in front of her affects her.I do hope that as the series continues she finally gets a clue!"
3,"great writer, too many species, refers to other books Too much","I really wanted to love this book. The writer is engaging. I should have started with book Number one, but, I did not.I read a short story first, liked it, and then snatched up the first book I found by the same author. It was my terrible mistake. 2 big problems, too many bits from other books that are not part of this story. Already at book 3 there are way too many characters and way too many facts that refer to other books and seem to have nothing at all to do with this one.I tried another book,[from the were wolf series] and gave up half way. I wanted to give up on this one, but kept hoping it would come together, it did not. Sorry.Then, after reading a few boring normal writers, I missed the fun. So, I started reading other books on this series, and I'm glad I did.As a series I think it is 4 star."
1,Rubbish with an original touch,One star for the style of writing but that's all. Strange worlds have always been one of my favourite topics. This book does not contribute anything new or special to the rich tradition.
5,DVD - mystery movie,"When Justice FailsPackage arrived early and in good condition. This is an old movie which did not get a lot of publicity, but was very good, with a surprise ending."
5,Great purchase,"I bought this CD for my daughter - a TRUE D'ANGELO fan. She played the CD she had so much it had tons of scratches and wouldn't play. She was really happy with this Christmas gift, ""Good job, MOM""!!"
5,Wonderful and heartwarming!,"This is a wonderful DVD that I am eager to share with friends and family. Clara is a delightful, feisty and kind personality whose kitchen is a joy to visit. I love the stories she tells about life during the depression while adeptly cooking up her recipes. The meals are so basic that they will seem almost exotic to modern palates, but they exemplify making the most of what you have and appreciating it. Every episode left me with a smile and a desire to do a better job in all areas of my life."
3,Cushiony Bruckner without many events,"Abbado is capable of much more dramatic and less wayward Bruckner than this live 1996 performance would indicate. The Gramophone reviewer flt that Abbado wasn't structuring a coherent performance but merely giving us one phrase after anothr, with scattered ideas about this or that effect. I heard him with the Berlin Phil. several years ago in the Bruckner Ninth and don't remember anything this bland. Tempos are regular, phrases aren't allowed to bloom, climaxes come and go without making a cumulative effect. The Vienna Phil. plays beautifully, even though the musicians are kept sadly in bounds. I suppose Abbado just hears this piece in his head with many small events and no major ones."
2,To many Trivial Detailes,Stirling writes my kind of stories.I have attempted to read almost everything he has ever written.His story concepts are FANTASTIC but his delivery is ATROCIOUS.The Peshawar Lancers is no Acception.He loads all his books down with so many minute detailes it actually takes away from the story.What would be a great 300 page book he turnes in to 500 pages you have to sift through just to get to the actual story.I usually give up reading his books after about 50 pages because the story seems to get so bogged down it is going no where.Detaile and Description are used to set the stage for the story but Stirling goes way overboard to the point it detracts from the story.
3,"Worth reading, but not up to Stirling's previous work","No need for me to rehash the book's outline, enough of that is already posted here. Stirling is a master of alternate history, and both his ""Draka"" and ""Nantucket-thrown-back-in-time"" series are marvellous. In my opinion, this one could also have been, had he but refrained from introducing the fantasy element of timeline-prescient ESP, and had instead simply stuck with his basic alternate history theme and its consequential developments. So even while I recommend this as an engrossing read, I don't think it merits more than 3 stars."
4,works great,As described. Makes it easy to use. works with any system. Makes the bank work easier. Shipped quick. Will order again.

4,"Cat is fun, Book is not.",My daughter loves the cat but the book is based on the movie and is not the preschool classic. Still a great buy on clearacne.
4,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in the origins of the Arthurian myths or in Williams's collections of Arthurian poems. The first section, which discusses the history of the myth of King Arthur is interesting and informative. The only drawback is that the writer died before he could finish it. The second section, written by C. S. Lewis, is an enlightening discussion of Williams's confusing poetry. It also reveals the humor and insight of Lewis, probably best known for his children's stories."
2,I can't believe this got good reviews.,"Maybe it's just Dibdin I hate. His style is arch and becomes boring after a few chapters, there is no attempt at realism, and his detective is unintelligent and unlikable. I had never read any Dibdin before, but the premise sounded like fun. It wasn't. The plot is stupid and simplistic and Dibdin doesn't prepare the ground for the double and triple revelations that would have made it worthwhile. If you haven't read Dibdin before and aren't a fan, don't waste your time and money"
2,"Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna ......","I have to be fair. This was not ever presented as Oscar Worthy in any way shape or form. And it didn't lie. Knowing all we know now about her and her life, you really have to look at this in a different light. It's funny in places, dumb in places. Sort of like Anna herself was. It's worth what I paid for it; but then of course I bought it dirt cheap second hand.The plot isn't memorable. Don't think it was supposed to be. The outtakes are funny. She had good timing. And she knew how to play to the camera. The truth is, when she was on the screen, you have problems remembering anyone else is in the shot. If you like Anna, go for it. If she isn't your cup of tea, don't bother. You won't find much in it as far as plot. But it's Anna."
3,Disappointing!,"Watch the first four volumes before watching this video. You'll understand why I was very upset. It seems they changed every aspects of what before(names, voices, movement, and animation). The only thing that I really like about it was the music. If you are Midevil( knights, kings, queens, and etc.) type of person, you will enjoy this video."
2,Interesting Concept But...,"Poorly written...redundant...not fully developed. I'm always wary of ""experts"" that utilize dumbing-down as a means for enlightenment. A few bright spots; personas, prototypes vs product, schemas... I particularly enjoyed the chocolate bribery papagraph [Chimey Ale works better]. Check it out and skim-it from the library--Not worth owning."
1,He quoted Parkinson's law,"From the book: ""Managers know that software development follows Parkinson's Law: Work will expand to fill the time alloted to it."" This is such an outdated idea and method for managers to deal with software engineers the rest of the book was tainted for me by his obvious distain for software engineers. Only the worst kind of un-trusting manager would assume that his engineers will naturally drag their feet if the schedule allows it.Another example of his contempt for programmers: ""All of the analysis and careful thinking done by high-powered and high-priced executives is made moot by the unilateral cherry picking of a programmer following his own muse or defending his turf.""Sorry but the white button down shirt wearing, schedule dictating, programmer dis-trusting manager has no place in software development nor writing books telling me how to manage my software engineers."
2,Better treatments exist elsewhere,"Cooper's book is old news. Check out Don Norman's Psychology of Everday Things for a more general, and more original treatment. The topic of user-centered design has been floating around in the area of human factors psychology for years, with many successful applications. Simply put, there isn't much new in this book.And the assertion that engineers lie at the root of the problem is naive. The true problem in devising usable systems that are also commercially viable and are delivered on time and within budget lies in a team approach, with users, developers, engineers, marketers, - ALL STAKEHOLDERS - involved in the process."
4,Put this in the category of pattern recognition,"If you are in the business making technical products, selling, marketing or supporting them, this book is a must read. Some have quibbled about the author's biased writing style or the simplistic, fuzzy nature of the message, and I agree. Nominally, these things affect the overall crispness of ""Inmates."" That said, the book provides a basic and well-formed way of thinking about customer workflow, and advocates a methodology for building products accordingly. Yeah, it should obvious, but we all know that the reality is different. So you use the tools of persuasion where you can find them, and this is one of them."
5,This should be required reading for every CIO,"This Bombshell, by Alan Cooper, is the best outline of logic I have read in the ever confusing IT - WWW world> We believe this message is so important we are getting copies for all our customers> Its worth its weight in Gold for every CIO > forget every planning web / e-commerce lecture class you have ever been to - This book has it all ( its a page turner easy read just like Tom Clancy > I started to put Post-it stickies on all the important pages marked for immediate action until I realized I was marking every second page. -- Forget Voodoo Science and Vacuum Pocket Consultants with chicken bones -- If your planning or using the WWW for any business, THIS IS THE MASTER GUIDE !!!!."
1,What a waste,"The book has a fantastic title and that's where it stops. Alan Cooper takes an entire book to tell us that software needs to be designed - a shock from someone who created a language that allows programmers to avoid design altogether, Visual Basic. He spends half the book knocking software engineers and the other half plugging his own company. Sprinkled in between are a few good ideas, but by the time you get around the author's arrogant style you no longer enjoy the insights he may offer.It's a pity that a book with such a great title is wasted on uninteresting and repetitious dreariness. It really goes to show that you can't judge a book by its cover."
1,Orphan,I was really looking forward to watching this film so was very disappointed when it would not play as it was the 'wrong region'! I had to send it back to the USA and am waiting for a refund from Amazon. I would have liked to have been warned about this prior to purchasing. I will be very wary about ordering dvd's from Amazon in the future.
4,Took me by surprise!,"I bought this movie for my girlfriend for valentines day, shes been wanting to see it and kept talking about it so i decided to get it for her. Well when it came time to sit down and watch it together i couldnt keep my eyes off the tv the movie is that intense! I was a little surprised that the movie contained so much blood but thats a plus for me. This movie really took me by surprise, i didnt think it would be such a good movie simply because it really didnt have alot of hype but overall i really recommend this movie!"
5,It's jump-out-of-your-seat good!,"No spoilers here. However, I will say all the awful things I heard about Orphan that put me off seeing it were absolute nonsense, and possibly comments made by people who never actually saw the film. There is much here that is implausable in the story line. However, if you can put your analytical mind on hold for a bit, Orphan will prove itself to be one of the best thrillers you've ever seen.Isabelle Fuhrman's performance is sheer perfection, elevating this DVD to a must for your collection. Do not miss it!"
3,Good but not great.,The cliff-hanger at the end was dissapointing. Overall it was good. I liked the suspense and the twist in the plot.
2,Just watch The Good Son,"This movie is pretty much just a remake of The Good Son with a lame M Night Shyamalan-ish twist at the end. Somebody falls through the ice? Check. A climactic treehouse fall? Check. Mother previously lost a child? Check. Drownings? Check. Animals murdered? Check.While the acting in this wasn't that bad, Macaulay Culkin did a much more believable job as an evil child that fools the parents. There was very little in this movie that actually made it worth sitting through the whole thing. The twist at the end was so weak that it actually offended me that the writers expected us to accept that as logical and possible. Who honestly finds people like Gary Coleman and Andy Milonakis frightening? Nobody, that's who."
3,Some dumb characters but some good elements too,"Yep, the father in this film really has the blinders on. He does not want to see what is right in front of him. He takes the orphan's side over that of his wife and kids. Also, there is a weird scene with him and Esther on the couch when he's been drinking wine but seems to be drugged. And I find it hard to believe that the little sister would have the physical strength to help lug a body around, or even to knock Esther down. Also, why didn't the orphanage know more info about where Esther came from in the first place? Big plot hole.However, there is a real, creepy factor at work in the film. Esther is just too advanced, too good to be true, highly manipulative, and well played by the young actor. Nice locations too, and CCH Pounder is always good in just about any role she takes on.It's worth a rental, if not a purchase."
4,A suprisngly good movie,I was suprised at just how good a horror movie this really was because most horror movies are not even average when compared with ordinary movies . I found that this movie was not only original but that it was also very entertaining . If I had to rate this movie on just a horror scale I would give it a 9 out of 10 .
4,Nasty little thriller.....,"Just wanted to note this was a nice roller coaster ride full ofsuspense, very well done, well acted, surprises. I thought itwas going to go in the direction of The Omen etc. but it didn't get into religion or the supernatural, more suspense, bad seed style evil. I would recommend this one, it packs a good punch when you're looking for something late at night."
2,OMG!,"I can't believe how tremendously funny this movie is! I went along with it for the first half hour or so, and then I realized the plot deals with a bunch of idiots, an a-hole husband bordering on gaydom, a brat son who seems to be around just to antagonize people, a wife who just can't seem to get it, a truly idiotic shrink who, in real life, would be thrown out of the practice -- so I really enjoyed everything from then on. I kept rooting for ""the orphan"", waiting for her to do away with the son first, then some of those rotten school kids. The husband got more and more gay with each scene, and went overboard in the climactic scenes. Speaking of climactic scenes -- whoa there, who thunk up that one? All in all, it's a terrific film if you want some real guffaws. Poor CCH Pounder, not only does she get messed up in the plot, but the fact that she even did the picture is sad. But, at least, the little deaf girl does some good work. The extra star is for her!"
1,sooo bad,"Normally a movie like this would make the audience question if the child really is evil or if the recovering alcoholic mom grieving her stillborn child is losing it, but not Orphan. No, the audience immediately finds out that Esther is absolutely evil. There are few surprises in this contrived plot. Most disappointing was the ""chilling alternate ending."" There's no context for the scene, so while it might be ""chilling"" under some circumstances, there's no way to know what crimes Esther has committed before this ending."
4,Good movie,We enjoyed this movie. It wasn't your traditional suspense. It had a great twist! Not too scare for teenagers to watch either. It wasn't tortuous which I like.
2,Outdated edition - not worth the price,"This book is available free online in PDF format from the Forest Products Laboratory (a division of the USDA). I decided to buy the paper copy because the price was fairly low, and I thought it would cost me about that much to print out all the chapters. Unfortunately, the technical production quality of this edition is VERY bad (small, murky print & illustrations). To make matters worse THIS IS NOT THE MOST RECENT EDITION. The online version has been updated to include newer research reflected in current building codes.This handbook is a classic, don't get me wrong. It should be part of any wood designer's library. It gathers together lots of basic technical information on things like creep and shrinkage that's very hard to find anywhere else. But do yourself a favor - skip this edition!"
4,Great for early-morning hikers,"The unit provides excellent light output, very good battery life, and is most suitable for hikers. It may not survive a two-foot drop, but is otherwise very durable for hand-held use. Were it sufficiently robust to withstand falling from a bike, it could be too heavy to carry around."
3,Okay for the money,got this today....1 of the 5 lights is very weak. actually useless. but the other 4 are fine. there is no slot to fit the screwdriver but i got the lens off anyway. it is worth the money (barely). my other light is a planet bike flasher. much better build quality....but also more expensive. if this will be your primary.....get the planet bike one. this will be my backup light.
1,MX-700 UNIVERSAL REMOTE,"The remote comes with no instructions. You have to email universalremote.com for a programming manual, then you have to email again for the software. They have a Live Update feature, but it does not work. Also the light on the universal remote went out on the first day. I have been waiting for over a week to get a response on that. Do your self a favor and keep shopping"
5,An unrecognized masterpiece.,"Independecy has not received its proper due. There simply isn't a bad track on this incredibly diverse album. It contains quiet tracks, like the ambient masterwork ""Scum"", and some sound experiments or flat out rockers like 'Man Man' that bring about a semi-creepy vibe. The lush, silently beautiful 'Blood Rush' and climactic 'All Different Things' are perhaps the best songs Bark Psychosis has ever done. I was stunned to learn that 'All Different Things' was recorded in 89.. talk about an omen for all of the ""post-rock"" to follow (especially Mogwai). Take this album with you as you drive along a dimly lit, desolate highway at night and savor the moment."
4,It's a Martin,"Got one of these little beauties about 10 years ago. It's a Martin, not much more needs to be said. It's a great little guitar; sounds great, though it's a little quiet due to the small body. The only drawback is the lack of a good leg rest position. It needs to be played standing or with the body up against the arm of the chair. Light, easy to carry, good feel. Good second guitar or if you have money for only one and need to move around a lot, this will not disappoint."
2,Not really history...,"I can't really take this book as history, though I'm sure this book includes many items that aren't available other places. It reads more like a brief defense of a career that was sometimes clouded in controversy. Other books like The Very Best Men and Wilderness of Mirrors were more informative, imo, and easier to swallow."
4,This is a nice alarm,I have this for about a year now and its been a nice alarm. I haven't had any issues. I would recommend this if you are looking for a good priced alarm with a lot of security features.
3,HELL AND HOT WATER - PREDATOR : ok but not great.,"The artform in this one is kinda unusuall. ,, but works pretty well, though it wasnt the coolest stuff i've seen ... story is kinda different too,, predators hunting for prey deep down in the sea... of course some stupid humans find out about the hunters and get smacked.. not much predator in this one.. if youre a predator fan , you should check it out, if youre just an average comic reader this one aint nuthin special...carl"
4,A nice walk down memory lane,"Just what I needed! Fun, quick recipes that WORK! A bit dated, of course, but still."
1,Bad Buisness,I never received the book I ordered and when I complained I never received a reply. I was told to go to another web site which was to complicated for me. I gave a written complaint there was no follow up by amazon. This is a bad way of conducting a business. I will think twice before I order through amazon again.
5,A great musician,"Benny Hester is a great musician! His versatility as a songwriter never ceases to amaze me. This CD contains the last two albums he recorded. My favorite songs are ""Before You Know It,"" ""You Weren't Meant To Live Your Life Alone,"" & ""Restless Nights."" A great addition to anyone's CD collection."
3,For Simpsons fans only...,"Bart Simpson's Guide to Life is all written from Bart Simpson's point of view and I think would be most entertaining for children under the age of 14 or for the immature at heart ;)For fans of the Simpsons and especially Bart, this book is a must-have as some of the jokes will only be fully understood by Simpsons fans - that is, those people who know and understand the Simpsons characters and the episodes, not to mention the style of humour.The Guide to Life contains somewhat mundane features such as ""how to cheat on a test"" (not to be read by impressionable kids that may try to use these ideas!!!) and Bart's version of the Five Food Groups (including sticky-runny!!). To demonstrate the immaturity of the book, one of the sections is entitle ""How to Avoid Girl Cooties"".This book is Bart Simpson in a nutshell; full of mischief and immature views on life. Only for the die-hard Simpson fan and only to be taken light-heartedly."
5,Cummins Diesel,"This K&N is an excellent Oil Filter for your Dodge Ram Diesel truck. IT goes on good, keeps the oil clean and no flow issues at all with my Cummins turbo diesel. The big nut welded on the filter makes it easy to take off when its time for a change. A lot of Dodge ram truck owners use these filters and it was recommended to me. I am glad I tried it. I bought 10 more they were such a good deal. I think I will go change my oil now, all three gallons. Thanks K&N for an excellent filter."
4,Too close for comfort,"As a veteran of a statewide campaign myself, ""A Perfect Candidate"" brought back a flood of memories from the statewide campaign. Following around the ill-fated Ollie North for Senate campaign, I was reminded of the tremendous highs & lows one feels during a campaign. Likewise, the movie has its own highs and lows, tedious and repetitive at times, smart and quick at others. Perhaps not the best movie ever made, a fun movie for any political veteran missing the campaign trail, or any political observer looking for insights into life in the war room. A warning: this movie is not for all movie-goers. If you don't like politics, you're not going to like this movie."
4,"Expensive, but nice.","If you haven't been scared away by the price yet, and are reading reviews of these hooks, then you probably won't be disappointed. They're substantial, nicely sized, and have a utilitarian non-shiny steel finish that I think looks good. Nothing shiny/cheap about them. $20 for six pieces of bent wire, however, seems a little ridiculous. But, as I say, they're all they're supposed to be, just pricey."
3,Out of the Box,"Radical, not the good ole gospel you grew up listening to. Tonex's album is very upbeat, very high energy. I love a lot of the songs that they play on the radio. I think that it is great for teenagers because it his music on this album has a very contempory beat but a spiritual message."
5,HE IS THE BEST,THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM AND TONEX.....HE IS THE BEST TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT BUT KEEP IT REAL.....THIS ALBUM COMES ALONG IN THE LINE OF MANY OTHER GREAT ALBUMS SO ALL I CAN SAY IS KEEP IT COMING TONEX WERE WITH YA!!!
2,Just not that good,"I received this CD for Christmas to add to my collection and I have to tell you I WISH I could have traded it in. The CD is just a huge mix of mess. Yea, Yea I know out of the box right? But C'mon! Can I get SOME order here? It is hard to even follow what song you are listening to because the track listings are all jumbled together . The CD has this Game show track from Family Feud and though the lyrics may provoke thought who wants to listen to the theme from a game show after work sitting in rush hour traffic? I think his vocal range and capability is wonderful but this was not the album to start with. It is full of head-aching rock tracks and it is really not the peaceful and soul-stirring worship experience I was looking for. Sorry can't let the top down and cruise to this one. I say out of the double CD 5 or 6 tracks tops!"
1,A waste of my time,"First off the sound quality is awful, that's a HUGE mistake for a live CD but not the biggest; The real problem is how Tonex doesn't know how to be a non-secular performer. He praises himself instead of God. Listen to Donnie McClurkin's live work or Israel and New Breed's ""Another Level"" CD, you can be evry entertaining AND stay gospel but Tonex can't deliver that feel. Live performance is where you really see what an artist is made of, judging from ""Out The Box"" Tonex is made of cardboard."
2,A lot of information but too many inaccuracies,"When I first read this book, I thought it was a well researched biography. Not so. After interviewing several members of Ray Charles' band, including Leroy ""Hog"" Cooper, David ""Fathead"" Newman, Ernest Vantrease, Don Peake and Marcus Belgrave, I learned that Michael Lydon did not do sufficient fact checking. The generalities in the book paint the big picture, but the 'devil is in the details' and that's where Lydon goes wrong. After hearing the stories from the musicians, I was disappointed to find that he had not done his homework. Finding out that pieces of the book are not accurate makes me wonder about the rest. I wasn't crazy about ""Brother Ray,"" the cursory memoir of the man who lived such an extraordinary life, but in retrospect, that book is at least closer to the truth, and 'guilt by omission' is a better way to define my disappointment with it."
3,Dismiss this mess,"Ray Charles is a legend, a genious of music and recording and a fine artist with extraordinary talent. But this book focused more on the times and people surrounding Ray Charles, than the actual man. I got lost in all the music jargin and mumbo jumbo-I wanted to know about this musician, his life, how he felt, what he did, how people felt about his music. But since I am not in the music business, nor do I understand most of the jargin, this book was lost on me. I skipped quite a few parts in the middle chapters because they just bored me and confused me. Not to say this was a bad book, but if you're like me when it comes to the language of music business, skip this one and buy the man's albums. His voice tells it all, you can just feel the emotions in his songs."
3,Pretty Good,The book Parvana's Journey is a pretty good book.It is a littlevilont and very sad. Lots of people die or suffer. There aresome funny parts and some exiting parts.Very few are happy.There is alot of redemtion.The book is about Parvana and her journey. She walks around trying to find her family. The seting of the book is Afghanistan. She is dressd like a boy.She meets lots of people. She meets a baby whose town was bombed and his mother was killed. Parvana names him Hassan.She also meets a boy who lives in a cave.He had no leg. His named is Asif.Parvana meets a girl named Leila.She lives with her grandmother .They live close to mine fields.I would recamend this book to people who like sad books.It is very interesting and you can learn alot about people who live in Afghanistan.This is a pretty good book.
1,I must have read a different book!,"This book was a total waste of time. Imagine this: Reading about dark humour without ONE example of it! We're told over and over how funny and edgy this comedy troupe is, but we're never given any evidence of it. The writing is pretentious and the characters are flat. The author made no effort to SHOW us anything or point us in any direction. She merely TOLD us how funny and charming these people were. Sorry. A few examples of wit would've helped."
4,Very good but not transcendant,"This will not revolutionize your life, but it is a better than average recording by a much better than average group of musicians of some very lovely music. You don't have to be a period music fan to enjoy this disc."
3,HK 2,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY UNCLE HE LOVES THESE SHOWS,HE GIVES IT 5 STARS..I'M REALLY NOT INTO THESE,BUT HE'S JUST CRAZY ABOUT GORDON RAMSAY.H;S CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF OWNING EVERY SEASON OF THIS SHOW EVER MADE"
4,A review of a review,"First, I'm a purist when it comes to U2 and that sets the stage so you can see where I'm coming from when I tell you , I was alittle disappointed in this DVD. It focused on DJ's and people that knew the band talking about the band, not the band themselves. If you knew nothing about U2 after Joshua Tree and wanted to learn more-this is good. But if you have a fair amount of knowledge: books read, fan club member,magazines, etc. you probably will find this disappointing, as I did. But, only to a ""4"" cause U2 is in there, but in glimpses or references. If I had known this I probably wouldn't have bought. This is not a true U2 product."
3,"""i hack them up like dolls""","says the killer. which pretty much describes the modus operandi of TORSO, your average woman-slashing, daftly-scripted giallo. it's not a particularly good one--neither as outlandish or outstanding as some of its other '70s counterparts--but a definite must-see for the final reel, a masterpiece of staging suspense that will have Hitchcock rolling in his grave and Brian de Palma green with envy (which i'm sure he must have ripped off somewhere along the line).the annoying thing about anchor bay's disc is the spurts of italian dialogue with english subtitles interspersed throughout the movie--it's kind of jarring. what they should have done is had english subtitles for the whole italian track (like on DEEP RED), so you get the option of watching either one. both the trailers are great though."
2,The main selling point? The title says it all,"There's a clear reason why all of the male characters in ""Torso"" spend their time ogling the female characters: it might have something to do with a certain region of the female anatomy (above the stomach and below the neck, in case you need it spelled out) which is frequently on display in this film. Most of the standard giallo elements get a bit shortchanged here: gruesome deaths, intriguing mysteries, clever red herrings, and so on (the gore is minimal and the killer's identity is extremely easy to figure out). Instead, the film's primary asset is the revelation that clothing is apparently not a high priority to college girls in Italy. Depending on what the viewer's priorities are, ""Torso"" is either a disappointment or a masterpiece."
4,Torso Torso Torso Torso Torso,"Overall it's a decent film and worth checking out if you're into this sort of thing. What more can I say? This is by far one of the best Slasher/Giallo's I've happened upon in years! Violent, atmospheric, stylish, moody and did I mention violent?Yes violent is definitely the word, because this packs it on like hamburger joints pack in salad.... Tons! Slashings, stabbings, eye poking, strangulation, drowning, etc, etc, etc...Don't listen to people whine about the only uncut version being Italian. I can assure you that once this Slasher starts playing, you won't care one bit.In many ways this is a fairly decent Italian slasher pic, but it stands out from the rest by having possibly the most beautiful women ever to have featured in this type of film."
4,Gore? No. Midnight Classic? Yes.,"Fans of spaghetti splatterfests beware- this is in no way a gore film. The title ""torso"" implies dismemberment; it implies bodies being cut apart with chainsaws, it implies axes and hacksaws and parts of the body that make squishy sounds. While there is one scene where there are bodies being dismembered, (off camera), this film does little to teach us about the human anatomy. That being said, this film does deliver in the ""it's 2 o' clock in the morning, i can't sleep, let's watch something completely jacked up"" aspect. There are many of the fine staples that make a great midnight movie: unintentional humor, long stretches of time with no dialogue, and somewhat eerily confusing plot points which add to your already disoriented mind state. Guzzle some cold medicine, keep yourself awake until 2:00, then pop this into your VCR."
3,"Better than Ms. Ross's Last Few,","First, I'd like to say as a rule I have been a huge fan of this writer for quite sometime but her last few novels have been a little less than what I had grown to expect from this writer, so I stopped buying her books for awhile hoping Ms. Ross would somehow magically get her MAGIC back. A friend gave me this book as a gift for my birthday. I was glad she did. I enjoyed the story and even though Ms. Ross still isn't 100% she is at least back to 75%, a doable percentage as far as I'm concerned. Now, I find myself looking forward to her next novel. Hopefully her skills will be back to normal by then!"
2,"Good characters, but the story just never grips you","Although I sympathised with Francis, the main character, I found this a very difficult read and nearly gave up twice along the way. The plot is slow and full of endless discussions about art and religion. Given the length of the novel, very few things happen. The characters are well drawn but the book is marred by a weak plot and tiresome dialogue. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Well-written but boring,"Davies is a great technical writer, and artistically engaging. However, I have always found his novels to be either dull or filled with characters that I find totally unsympathetic. This book is true to form. The first book of this trilogy, The Rebel Angels, was a prime example as well, although much more interesting than this one. I have no desire left to read the third book in the series. I finished the second only because I thought the use of the written language was outstanding, but in the end, I read for enjoyment, not to admire technical perfection."
2,im very disapionted,ok i bought this violin thinking it was only about 60 or 70 dollars but i ended up paying almost 100 dollars including shipping wich was more than 30 dollars and the violin didnt come tell a week later and the worst of it is it was damaged i had to take it to the violin shop and cant play it for another week do not buy this violin even though it is a buetiful violin it isnt worth it unless you are willing to pay alot of money for a crappy violin
2,okay product,"the box is cute but a 2 and three years old dont know how to care for it. very easily bends and is not presentable after a month.,"
5,An Underappreciated Gem,"To start with, the cast is great - Kathy Bates, George C. Scott and even a very young James Van Der Beek (of Dawson's Creek fame) along with a lot of lesser known but also talented performers.The story is about Angus, a kid who doesn't fit in as well as he'd like at school. His relationship with his grandfather is especially touching, and the whole movie is both poignant and a lot of fun. Highly recommended, particularly for an evening in with someone you love..."
2,NOT what I expected....,"Well, I was browsing in a used book store, and this big book of Limericks caught my eye again. I usually love limericks, but upon reading this collection, was shocked. I would dare to say that the word ""pornography"" kept popping up in my head while reading. I was sure that i had just read a few of the more extreme ones, so would turn to another area of the book. Again, just dirty and naughty words filled this book.So, if you are looking for a laugh and really enjoy limericks with a naughty twist, then this is your book. I, for one, threw it in the trash once I realized it. One of only two books I ever threw away instead of giving to goodwill, etc. There are too many wonderful books to read out there. This did NOT belong in my library anywhere."
2,Save Your Money,"I bought 6 of these from a local merchant with the expectation they would outlast a standard 9v Alkaline. Three of them have already failed in less than 2-years. The worst part... ALL 3 of them died in the middle of the night!! Nothing like getting out the ladder at 2am to pull a battery just to get the smoke detector to stop announcing ""Low Battery"". This past weekend I replaced all 6 with Alkalines. The best part... an 8-pack of name brand 9v on sale cost less than the price of just one of these."
1,Get the real Skynyrd instead,"I am not a purest. For example, I think the current Allman Brothers lineup is as good as ever, not only without Duane but even without Dicky , and ABB's Live at the Beacon Theater (2003)DVD is incredible. Yet to me it is an abomination that this LS lineup can use the sacred Skynyrd name. The real Skynyrd indeed was one of the best bands of all time. Here, Johnny Van Zant utterly fails as a Ronnie impersonation, and would never have been hired for a high school dance without his brother's name. Some things should just be illegal. Don't waste a minute watching this one when you could be watching Freebird the Movie or ABB at the Beacon instead."
1,Uniden Marine radio,This unit did not work from the start. It picks up the emergency weather channels but none of the other vhs ones.
3,inconsistent,"It seems like some or all of the ports just quit working periodically. Therefore, there is inconsistent performance. I don't understand why this would be. For instance, my keyboard was plugged into the hub and quit working. I plugged it into the computer directly and it worked."
1,Buyer beware!,"This lamp does not have any brightness control and the light is blindingly bright. Because it uses a proprietary pin socket, you cannot replace the bulb with an ordinary lightbulb, and Verilux does not make a lower ""wattage"" bulb for this lamp.I was told by the vendor Independent Living Technologies (Garner, NC) that older models did have an adjustable switch but that the current model does not. They would not refund my money even after I returned it to them.Caveat emptor/buyer beware. Only buy this item if you can get a money back guarantee. It cost me $35 to ship it back."
4,One of my favorite movies.,The guy from Greendale is wrong. The worst National Lampoon movie ever is a tie between National Lampoon's Last Resort and National Lampoon's Golf Punks. I like this movie very much. I think it's great.
2,Tommy Chong Died Too Early,"This was not a great movie. It's usually a 50/50 chance that a National Lampoon movie will be good or horrible. The best thing this movie had going for it was casting Tommy Chong as the bus driver ""Red"". No surprises here.... he did a lot of drugs and looked like a roadie for the Dead, but he still makes me laugh. The problem was the character died off too soon as with any chance of the movie breaking even at average."
4,Another Lester board book classic,Australian children's author Alison Lester did a series of four books (available overseas as a boxed set) that depict very real little kids in very real situations. Great drawings in the margins too that my son has loved identifying.
4,Strangely 19th C. feeling prose,"The underlying ideas are generally sound, but I can't shake the impression that the author wants to sound like someone from the late 19th century. Language is on the florid side, and generally assumes male gender, etc. It's a strange little time capsule, but it reads quickly and the information that Brooks is focused on comes across fairly easily."
2,"Mostly outdated advice, unless you study history","I was deceived by the word ""timeless"" appearing in the reviews, don't fall for that. The advice is mostly outdated, even the final chapters added in the 2nd edition. The book will serve you well, if you want to study a history of programming (assuming up to date with current state of the art, otherwise even the predictions are faulty). Most of the problems described do have real solutions in the mainstream programmting today. Save your money and buyJoel on Software: ...you won't miss anything from MM-M."
4,Book Review - Mythical Man Month,"I was very disappointed with this ""Classic"" volume. It doesn't seem to have aged very well!"
3,"Good insight, but poor for today's project manager","Although the book is an interesting read and offers some insight to the history of project management, the concepts and ideas written in the book are so old that I find it hard to believe the book will be of any interest to today's project manager.I don't expect people to improve their project management methods from reading this book, but if that is what you want to achieve, this book won't do much for you.For me, I found it hard to finish it as I was bored while reading it. Many of the writings were obvious today and I felt that I didn't gain anything."
1,"I thought I bought a ""timeless"" book...","... and then I started reading!The references contained in the book are all obsolete and ununderstandable without background research. Considering this is a new edition, it really lacks footnotes explaining about all the systems mentionned, their size, their importance at the time etc. The author mentions those systems as if everyone knew what they were and did.One of other completely obsolete comments include the phrase ""we had available a computer-driven text-editing software and this proved invaluable"". Although, at the time, it might have proved very useful, word processors have long become a commodity, so those kind of claims make the whole matter laughtable today.Not to mention the very boring writting style.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,Must Read for Software Professionals,"This book has been extensively reviewed, so what it there to add? From my perspective, two things.First, if you aspire to being a professional in the software industry and have not read this book, then you must read this book. Of particular interest are Brooks reflections on the past 20 years in this edition.And, secondly, for those that criticize this book as being outdated, I suggest that understanding the history of our profession and the fundamental concepts that Brooks discusses is essential. To paraphrase Santayana, Those who do not understand the past are condemned to repeat it."
4,Software Engineering methodologies that will endure.,"The Mythical Man-Month showed me that many of the methodologies and concepts behind a good software design project have been around for some time and will endure for time to come. A good project team (surgical team), estimation, requirements, design, documentation, and debugging/testing are all critical to a project's success. I have seen many mistakes identified by Mr. Brooks; people thinking that all will go well, systems designed and turned over with no documentation, poor scheduling of projects, no error building in software projects, giving prototypes to the customer and setting wrong expectations. The Mythical Man-Month can give you a solid foundation for software project management, but keep in mind there is no true ""silver bullet"" to software engineering as stated by Mr. Brooks."
4,"A workable, memorable approach to adaptive communication.","The book gives a pragmatic, easy-to-remember approach to the communication problems that continue to hamper male-female communication in the workplace. It is written with clarity of ideas, and with enough humor to make it enjoyable reading. This a standout among the books on communication that belong in a workplace library."
4,Great introductory book,"I bought this for myself and also for my parents to read to understand my social anxiety. It's a good ""first"" book to get an idea of what you need to do to overcome shyness and self-esteem issues. It presents the topic in clear, simple English without much of the medical mumbo-jumbo. However, I don't expect anyone to truly ""Triumph over shyness"" just by reading this book. However, I still recommend this book to those that have just decided to do something about their shyness or social anxiety disorder."
3,Foodsaver V2440,"So far this product is working. But it only works for a few seals (maybe 10 to 12) and then it quits and must rest. It is very frustrating. If I only had to do 3 or 4 things at a time, it would be OK. I give frozen meals to some handicapped relatives for gifts and need a unit that can make maybe 50 in 1 sitting. Next time I am going to spend more and try to get a semi professional unit."
4,Tilia V2440 Advanced Design FoodSaver Home Vacuum-Packaging System,"I have a model with the ""canister"" feature. I would say that items in canisters don't keep quite as long as advertised, but are a big improvement over other storage methods. Overall, I am very satisfied so far."
1,Pumps stops before bag seals,"If this FoodSaver fails to detect that it's done creating a vacuum, then one must press ""seal"" in which case the pump stops. If the bag wants badly enough to open back up, e.g. if it's stretched tight around a kaffir lime, then some air will get back into the bag.Perhaps this doesn't happen with brand new gaskets, but not a robust design, when it would have been so easy to keep the pump running until the seal was complete. In fact, this is I-can-barely-fog-a-mirror stupid.Planes tend to stay in the sky because if one thing goes wrong, they have redundant systems and robust designs, so the pilots can work around the problem. If I had been one of the engineers that designed this FoodSaver, I'd be embarrassed to fly."
2,wasn't impressed,"i was looking forward to using this productso much.i just wouldn't vacuum, it would seal.but no sucking action.very disappointed. i would have sent it back, however, it rained on the box outside...this was a waste of money for me."
4,Gets the job done,This multimeter gets the job done. The only complaint is that it is bulky in size. Overall I have no issues with taking voltages and resistance readings and it works like a champ. I would definitely buy another one.
5,Should be required reading to gain citizenship,"This book takes a seemingly innocuous subject- high school football- and shows how it becomes intertwined with every aspect of life in a ""typical"" U.S. town. It is a pleasure to see an author know his subject so well. I would like to see a follow up ten years after the story to see where the characters are now and if the town has changed at all."
1,BAD Battery,I bought the 40 pack 6 months ago to mainly use in my digital camera. It seems at least half of the batteries will only last 8 to 10 pictures (without flash). I bought some Dollar General cheap alkalines and they will last minimun of 100 pics. Ready to throw the last few away.
1,This book was stupid..& obviously partisan,"If you were to disect sentences of any person in public life, you can make them look stupid......it is almost scary what people can do to make public figures look stupid. I never liked Quayle, but junk books like this are not worth the paper they are written on."
3,"Okay, not great","I got this keyboard because the box advertised the item as ""soft-touch.""Actually, the keys are stiffer than I would have liked. It's a very basic keyboard, and it works fine. It's functional. But soft-touch, it's not.This keyboard is fine for someone who doesn't do a lot of typing, or whose hands are not sensitive. But if you're looking for soft-touch keys as I was, skip it."
5,the word on the street,"the word on the streetEye-opening, very useful in developing dramatizations. Gives more understanding of the Bible from a human standpoint."
1,thought it was lifter (1996) ''melinda'' follow up,"i blindly bought this cd thinking it was the follow up to 1996's ''lifter'' melinda (and everything was fine) but boy was i taken, it sounds like one of those albums where somebody saved up a few bucks ( or borrowed it from daddy) and tried to make some music worth selling, i have it and i still don't know who the people who recorded it are. ''you wanna buy it?"
4,Very informative!,"I like this book the picture are in black and white though, but all in all a good book for someone just beginning their journey or trying to get information on how to start growing locs."
1,Hair locking everything you need to know,The title was a little misleading thought it was instruction on how to start and maintain the dread hair style not the history of it.
2,HORRIBLE,"Okay so first of all this was my first TV TUNER card and I am VERY disappointed. The quality of the video was a joke, it constantly froze my Pentium 4 2.8 GHZ HT system with 512 MB of Ram and a GEFORCE FX 5200 video card, as well as 120 GB HDD. When you tried to record anything ti froze, and overall this card just sucks. DON'T BUY THIS!"
5,An excellent business guide.,"Excel users may already be aware of the power of pivot tables, which allow summarization of 50,000 rows of data with one click of the mouse - but many user's guides don't begin to touch upon its powerful features. PIVOT TABLE DATA CRUNCHING provides a tutorial which promises users and prior Excel fans the ability to get up to speed quickly, using real-world examples such as how to highlight productivity channels and produce meaningful reports. An excellent business guide.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,right on,many excellent tips that i would not have picked up elsewhere. minor downer - ordered two different books on the same day and this one took two weeks longer to receive even though both were UPS ground.
3,Not really for advanced users,"I was encouraged by other reviewer's comments that this book was useful to beginners AND experts, but I disagree. I consider myself a fairly advanced user/macro developer, and was hoping this book would help me take my Pivot Table skills to another level. The book is laid out well - and DOES cover its topics thoroughly - but it is really more of a book for intermediate excel users who may have little to no experience with Pivots."
5,A correction for a previous reviewer,"One of the reviewers indicated that ""Hesitation Blues"" waswritten by Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson only recorded 29songs and this wasn't one of them. The song was written in1915, before his time, by Art Gillham,Billy Smythe, andScott Middleton. In 1925 Gillham did an acoustic session forColumbia and Hesitation Blues was done in two takes. The songwas made popular by Rev. Gary Davis and later Hot Tuna wholearned it from Rev. Davis. The Rounders probably learned itfrom an old Gary Davis record."
2,Not a Visual C++ reference,"This book gives excellent coverage of the C++ language as it pertains to the Windows environment. Despite it's title, however, it's coverage of Visual C++ appears to be an afterthought. Almost all examples are console apps to be compiled and ran from the command line. A good book for C++ programming, but not for learning the capabilities of Visual C++."
4,Fender Locking Tuners for MIM Strat,"I purchased these Fender Locking Tuners for my MIM Fender Strat. I bought the guitar used and I could never keep it in tune, as a result I could not use it when playing with my church group ( which is in tune) These tuners arrived within 5 days of me ordering. They are Made In Taiwan. Changing the tuners was a breeze. Just remove the string from the old tuner, then remove the single nut holding it in place. Slip the new Locking tuner into the vacant hole and tighten the nut. Fit exactly without any modification. The guitar now stays in tune.( Though not as good as my Martin) I had not heard of locking tuners before, and was very pleased with the ease and how quick it made to change strings.Good purchase, good price."
1,dont buy here,This book is one of the very best handbooks for field medicine in the world. The only problem is that it can be found for $110.00 instead of (ouch!)$500.00. And if you buy it from the other place (name withheld) it also includes a CD which has even more information and additional material not found in the book. Buyer beware.
1,RIP OFF,HUGE HUGE RIP OFF. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THIS BOOK IS NOT TEAR RESISTANT OR WATER RESISTANT. PAGES ARE STUCK TOGETHER. DON'T BE HAD. INFO INSIDE IS GOOD BUT YOU CAN PRINT THE SAME OFF THE INTERNET AND MAKE YOUR OWN BOOK FOR CHEAPER. PLEASE DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY ON A CHEAP COPY CAT MANUAL.
3,Hawaii for Free...,"A good portion of what Hawaii for Free covers is also covered in many of the better Hawaii guidebooks, like my favorite: the Unofficial Guide to Hawaii. The real question is whether the added tips, like the time and place for free Celtic Pipes and Drums practice is worth the book's price. I thought no."
5,Deathgirl.com.. once you hear them you will love!,"I found this band on a whim, and immediately fell in love with them. They were under a ""goth"" label but I think its hardly that. Melissa comes up with some amazing pop songs that carry a good rock lyric. She isn't singing about flowers and candy, she's singing about people she hates ""I know that I don't like you, you're so cheap.."" she sings. The last track features a great rhythm and beautiful lyrics. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes a good kick in the...True it may be a bit pop sounding, but at the end of the day you'll realize this cd is worth every penny. The only track I could have done without is the first track ""Daddy"" it just sounds like a mess of music and vocals that really does NOT sound like ANY other song on the album. Great CD, it quickly became one of my favorites! I wish this band would have made more before they called it quits.."
1,The worst book ever!,"How the hell did this book get published? The writing is horrible and the stories this idiot writer tells are so over the top and false the reader has to come to two conclusions. 1 This book was published for pure propaganda and supported/pushed by law enforcement or 2 The writer has a ""hook"" with the publisher oh wait and 3 BOTH 1 and 2 which is what this book is pure 1 and 2!"
5,"Awesomeness, seriously","If you're already an Aquabats fan, you should love this DVD. The sound and video quality are mediocre at best, but what were you expecting? I find it surprising they were able to throw together a DVD at all. However, looking past the technical issues (including the issues in the concert itself. d'oh!) you'll get a fun Aquabats concert experience. I just saw them live, and the dvd comes as close as possible to capturing the excitement of the live show. I'm definitely not disappointed with Serious Awesomeness."
4,AQUABATS LIVE,"I have seen this band live at least 9 times over the past 8 years and have to say that they are definitely a riot to be part of live, I mean SEE live. Their shows are unlike the typical concert and very much involve the crowd so that you feel part of the show with cheesy childhood references and superhero vs evil shenanigans which you will see in this DVD. Anyone from 24-34 and a lingering for the old childhoods days of suburban summer should find this DVD and the bands sense of humor entertaining. As an added bonus the music is fun and catchy. Give this DVD a chance and check out the cds ""Fury of the Aquabats"" and ""The Floating Eye of Death."" You will be glad ya did cadet!Special songs are ""Playdough"", ""Giant Robot Birdhead"", ""Pizza Day"" and ""Pool Party."""
4,Very useful and good design,This seems to be a great investment...but it may take a decade or so to prove it.
4,Lcsw,"Im working in my clinical supervision for LCSW and needed a book that breaks down personality d/o. My clinical spvr and I decided on this book. Im not finished reading the book yet but the book breaks down all of the personalty d/o, fives cases studies and within the case studies identifies sx tailored to her disorder. Great resource and I plan on using this book to study for the LCSW exam!"
2,Sloppy Set,"I bought this one for some of the live releases that were not available elsewhere. It is what it was, a sloppy, jam with a few members of the Stones, trying to pay back for Keith's drug offense. I really have to be in the mood for this one cover to cover."
3,battery charger,"The charger works fine, however on the fist use the strap came lose and it droped off the table to the floor. The only thing I wanted was for the charger to be automatio and shut down after battery charging, this one doesn't. I shuld have looked further."
4,"Looks good, works well.",Seems to work real well. Haven't had to use it in start mode yet.Wish it had an on off switch.
2,Sub-par,"I had to go back awhile to write this review, but this ring is NOT worth the amount. For 30 bucks, I expected a heavy, solid ring, this was a cheaply made, semi hollow waste of time and money. To make matters even worse, I ordered a size 8 and recieved something much smaller...it is items like this that frustrate the public, I thought I ought to warn somebody, but if you like this ring, KEEP SEARCHING and you will find a quailty product somewhere else, this one however is not..."
3,Review of Drake Passage Map,I was disappointed with the map. I purchased it a few months after our trip to the Antarctic Peninsula and found that many of the places we visited were not shown on the map. This could possibly be explained by the fact that the map is in Spanish and we used English names.
3,Cruise Ship Map,"If you are one of the many tourists who visit the Antarctic Peninsula by cruise ship, then this is the map for you. An excellent reference to take with you and plot your voyage while travelling or once you get back before you forget the details of your exact route. Not a nautical chart, but an excellent map to explain to friends and family where you went and to use with your photo's to show where you visited on your trip to the Antarctic."
3,"Map IN SPANISH, nice souvenir","Tha map is in Spanish, no big deal, ocean is oceano and passage is pasaje, no one should really get confused! Print is a bit too small perhaps, but then it's hard to fit this large area in a single map even at 1:5.000.000. Nice to have little boxes to stamp and sign by ship captain, travel companions and bases visited. A real Antarctic buff might even have this framed upon return, it looks like one of those old mavigation maps... but it is NOT a navigation maps as clearly stated at the bottom. The back is blank, pity, could have been used for more detailed local area maps."
3,"-Worked ok, then quit abruptly","Large capacity, though an advantage, made it slow in toasting. The one I bought in 2008 worked for two years, then quit abruptly."
2,Too Quick and Stressfull,"I LOVE workout videos and because of them I got in the best shape of my life without a gym... Well now im pregnant... You can still do so much, but have to be safe about it thats why im still buying videos, but pregnancy ones & walking daily. I did not enjoy this at all, it was so QUICK and stressfull. The exercises are what they should be, but i would not get this one. Trust me when i say get Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout. Different things work for different people because everyones brain and body are different, this is just not for me. Good luck to all you pregnant ladies :)"
5,Great workout,"I loved this workout! I am 31 yo, pregnant with first kid, and a moderate exerciser. My typical workout consisted of using the elliptical 30 minutes a day, about 3 days a week. This is a great supplemental workout as well as by itself. I found the instructor easy to follow, and her light encouragement about breathing, etc. less abrasive than other workouts. Her partner workout reminds me of my hubby... you can tell he's a little grumbly about it. :)"
2,rosechild,What a disappointment! I didn't like it at all!She is all over the place running from the coffee table to the love seat to the sofa?!Not organized at all which makes it difficult to follow. Bad lighting and sound.Wouldn't recommend it at all.I wish I could get my money back.
2,WOA!!!! INTENSE WORK OUT!!,"Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness FixTHIS VIDEO IS REALLY HARD CORE, BUT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU. NOT FOR THE AVERAGE MOTHER. The video is divided into 4 sections. The warm up, gets you really warm...typical aerobic class grape vines, etc., The next part is pretty intense lunging, squatting and plank type positions, pushups, etc. The 3rd part is floor work with lots of leg lifts (you'll want a really good thick mat here or your hips will be aching). The last part is stretch and relaxation, although i didn't find it very relaxing. If you are used to Yoga practice for stretching and relaxation, you'll probably want to skip this part as I did and just throw in the stretch and relaxation part of a pre-natal yoga video. (you need water, a mat and a chair to complete this video)."
5,"Different, but fantastic!","I love to workout while I'm pregnant. When I first bought this workout, I was only in my 3rd month. My first impression was that it was too easy, and the format was totally different from my other non-pregnancy workouts. However, as I moved into my 5th month of pregnancy, my usual workouts got a little more challenging than I felt was safe for me and the baby. I pulled out Prenatal Fitness Fix and started doing it on a regular rotation with my other prenatal workout. I've really started to tell a difference. I've adjusted to Erin's style and now, I really enjoy it and I do the workout at least 3 times a week. If you're a fairly fit individual I recommend this workout for your later months of pregnancy. If you're a beginner, you can start this workout whenever and it will keep your heart pumping!"
1,Could be dangerous to follow her speed,"I am a pretty fit person (been working out at least 5 days a week, including one day with a trainer, for years), but I think this video contains prenatal exercises that are way too fast and jerky for most pregnant women. If you go at your own pace, it's fine, but following her speed (especially during the ""double-time"" parts) is probably too much for most women. You can tell she's a group exercise instructor--I'm sure she's a great teacher in that context. But I don't think the dismissive ""you're okay, you're fine"" comments she makes during the more intense parts of the video are necessarily the message to send to a pregnant woman who may be overexerting."
2,not what i expected,"I am 10 weeks pregnant with my second child. Prior to finding out I was pregnant I worked out everyday. When I work out I am usually using dvd's. I also incorporate running, walking, and chasing my two year old. After finding out I was pregnant I was determind to find a challenging workout that would compare to my pre pregnancy workouts. After reading the rave reviews regarding this workout I thought I had found the workout I was looking for. I will say the workout itself is not bad...but THE PRODUCTION IS HORRIBLE! The instructor takes several ""pee breaks"" and pauses foor water. Although some may find this comical I do not. I am quite able to pause the dvd on my own for breaks. I need a quick challenging workout that doesn't waste my time. I also purchased ""body by trimester"" and absolutely LOVE IT! The ""perfect pregnancy vol 1"" will be arriving on Tuesday. Let's hope I have more success with that order."
3,remote works well but casing could be better,"It may be pointless for me to write a review for a remote that is currently out of stock and may not ever be reproduced. That said, I got one of these with my Design Tech Auto Command remote starter. The unit worked well for as long as I had the remote (a couple years). The clasp on the remote isn't the greatest and separated itself from my keys in my pocket a couple times. Eventually the plastic case started cracking where the chain connects and one day when I was out, it broke altogether, fell off my keys, and I've never found it again. It would have been nice if there was a TINY bit of metal reinforcement in the plastic loop or if they had included two remotes with the unit. A replacement remote would have cost me as much as the whole system originally cost me, so I never got one."
5,"""Bizarro Among The Savages"" is funny and touching.","I don't know if I've ever read a more enjoyable book than ""Bizarro Among The Savages."" I couldn't go two pages without laughing out loud. I commend Mr. Piraro for not taking the easy way out and making fun of the people he stayed with on his book tour. Rather, he seems to have a gift for connecting with people and realizing the good points of anybody. He also doesn't pull any punches when talking about his own spiritual/emotional journey, and I applaud him him for his openness and frankness.This is a great book! Even if you've never read his comic strip, read this book!"
1,scattered,"The ""author"" tries too hard to be funny, all the while with a very egocentric attempt in disecting his wreck of a marriage; trying vehemently to secure his readers pity. Advice: Stick with cartooning. And personally: It Takes two to tango."
4,works well,the battery does not last long enough when in service.The unit itself is very clear and easy to handle'
3,Pretty good,"Ive bought all the street fury dvds since they started.And i noticed that the quality has gone down with each new installment.They keep getting worse and worse.Espeacilly the last 2,Onyx and Ice.Thankfuly jade is pretty good and isnt as bad as those two.It doesnt match the quality of the earlier street furies.But at least Tokyo pop is getting back on track with this series."
1,Label is EXTREMELY misleading,Rerecording of orignals - CURB doesn't say anywhere on the outside of package. Rick sounds tired and just wants to get it over with. bad business for CURB label.
5,Buck knives,"The picture was not correct but the description was. I love Buck knives. IMHO Bucks are the best knife for the price. I own more buck knives than any other knife because they are sharp, easy to sharpen and work well. This knife was no different than any other that I own. I have the smaller brothe of this knife and use it as my edc."
4,Lots of fun,"This was a very funny book. It wasn't very believable, but as long as you don't take it too literally, you'll have a great time.It's the story of Penny, a bride who is dumped at the altar. Her mother, believing (falsely, as it turns out) that Penny was beaten as well as jilted by her fiance Bram, knocks Bram over the head with a champagne bottle and smuggles him into a secret room in her mansion. He's forced to stay there until he writes an apology note to every single guest at the wedding AND eats all the leftover food that would have been served at the reception. Of course, his athletic physique is shot.There's a subplot involving Penny's mother and Bram's father, who doesn't know that his new paramour is holding his son captive.Meanwhile, Penny learns why Bram abandoned her, and the whole situation comes to a ridiculous but entertaining climax.If you liked Valerie Frankel's other books, you'll probably enjoy this one."
1,BUY THE HARDCOVER!!,"What a waste of time, money and energy!!This cd allows you to review the NEC 2005 handbook but you can't print the whole thing to use as a paper hardcover reference, only sections can be printed.Why pay twice as much for a product that only has half as much value. The paper book version costs half of what this costs and you can photocopy it for reference if you want.Also included on this disc are ""read only"" versions of the last three versions of the NEC (again somewhat limited if not altogether useless. Imagine dragging your computer or laptop around with you on a major construction job, ready to pull it out whenever you had a question.. consider that laptop disposable). To top it all off the program only allows two activations, so you can only install it on two computers or activate it twice online ( laptop, work or home totals three... good luck).This product is definately the result of corporate, copyright infringement paranoia!!"
3,Pretty good book but 1 little Question,"This was a relativly good Sci-fi book but it had conflicting facts with the other books. One of them was that in ""Mother"" Flynx got Pip when he was in his mid or late teens but other books make it sound as though he found Pip when he was much younger. The book was entertaining but you can tell it was written after some of the others."
2,Ostentatious analysis of an otherwise simple subject,"If you are looking for enjoyable reading of or about community cookbooks, don't buy this book. If you are looking for ostentatious babble about analyzing community cookbooks this one is for you. The authors wordiness never quite gets to the point, however there are a few glimmers of. interest offered by some of the contributing essayists in the book. Unfortunately those sparks of historical information and excerpts really do not hold on to interest for the rest of the book."
5,A Simple Masterpiece,"The movie, NOT ONE LESS, is a modern day story about a young 13 year old girl who is assigned as a substitute teacher for a group of primary school children in rural China. She is promised by their teacher, in addition to her regular pay for being a substitute, that she would be paid an extra 10 Yuan if she manages to keep the kids from dropping out of school before his return -- hence the title.In addition to the storyline, what is really interesting about this film is that no professional actors were used in making this movie. Yet the acting, the message, and the plot are fused seamlessly to create a touching and sensitive story. This movie will make you a fan of its Director, Zhang Yimou."
2,Poor packaging and material,"Bought for my wife. When I received it, the top cover had visible scratches. I assume that was due to inadequate packaging. Also, after less than a week of use, the bottom drawer fell apart."
4,Excellent for helping women make positive career choices,"Work Left Undone helps readers understand the choices which they have made and how attitudes (both positive and negative), stereotypes, and personal feelings have affected the direction of their lives. Readers learn the value of planning for the future and making conscious forward-thinking decisions based on real abilities and real hopes and aspirations instead of leaving life up to lucky or unlucky accidents of fate. What we want for our daughters, what we hope for as we educate girls is to give them the confidence and ability to make these choices without regret and to value their work in their family, the community and corporate world. Sally Reis' work accomplishes much to this end."
4,The French have invaded the Amazon,"First off, let me convey that this is the first time I have purchased a book on military uniforms, so my review will be more of a brief description since Amazon has not posted any info on this book. All text written in this book, is written in French. This is wouldn't be too much of a problem if I understood french, and since the majority of the book is made of pictures, but Amazon ""should"" have posted info on this, and it would be nice to actually understand the descriptions. But let me remind you again, this book doesn't contain vast amounts of text in the first place. The illustrations are all well done as well. If I understood French, this book would most likly recieve 5 stars. But, because of the french text, and Amazon not posting info on this, the book becomes nothing more then a very nice picture book if you do not understand the french language."
3,An antidote against spineless heroines,"After surviving her first year, Kel still has a long way to go to reach her dreams of being a knight. But she is not one to give up, despite all the obstacles a prejudiced teacher and fellow pages put in the way. Some of the descriptions are not as smooth and connected with the rest of the writing, but it's still enjoyable. I also appreciate very much the development of the main character and the very realistic challenges she faces. It's nice to have a strong heroine who feels 'real' (ie doesn't have super powers or isn't a vampire etc). I'd recommend it especially for girls, as an antidote against some of the spineless heroines in other books."
5,This is a great book that you Must read,"This is a great novel that is a GREAT READ. I just finished reading it and I jumped online to help others choose it. I love the plot. I always thought that Kel should get together with either Neal or Cleon but i'll have to wait untill the next book to find out which. I hope Lalasa gets rich with her sewing shop. Personally, I think that Joren even with his bitersweet friendship is responsible for the near disaster at the end.( i won't tell you what it is I want you to read the book.) I hope that sometime soon Kel will figure out that Alanna the Lioness is her 'mysterious benefactor'!. I hope you read one of the best books of my fave author.If you don't you'll be missing something."
2,Julia Phillips rages against middle age.,"We know why she wrote the book, to pay the IRS, but we love the con. Julia Phillips rages against turning older (and feeling it) and wiser (but, not profiting from it). The book starts,stops, rambles, attacks, gloats, whines. At times we want her to shut up; at others, we want more. Overall, a frank, if self-serving, slice of modern life."
3,Aaaah Julia,"I found this book at 'The Dollar Tree',and quickly laid down a buck for it.I found the author egotistical,meanspirited,selfcentered,and never the blame for anything.She only saw the bad in people ,and was quick to find everbody's flaws and/or weaknessess.Her gay stereo/arch types bothered me as an attempt to either control or condemn people.I wanted to do her right away."
3,Hrmpphhh....,"We have a filter assembly that supports only this type of filter. I believe that it works pretty well. However I had a discussion with a friend who works on furnaces and air conditioners for a living. He strongly suggested that I change to a smaller filter and install a new filter frame. Apparently when the filter is too large and thick, it chokes back the air more than slimmer models and causes your furnace to expire more quickly. Not to mention that these cost around $20-$25 while the slimmer 3M replacements only cost a few bucks. Overall it works, but it might be best to switch if you're using these."
3,First reviewer was exactly correct,"Do not buy this holster unless you are set up to drill out 2 rivets and replace them with machine screws and lock-tighted nuts, inserting a spacer between halves of the holster. For me, this is trivial, and I end up with a nice holster, cheap, but it would be useless without modification."
2,"Light, good fit on hip, but too tight grip on the pistol","I bought this to holster a Glock 17. The holster itself is light, has good belt-loops and an arched shape so that it aligns very well and comfortably to the shape of your hip. However, once you pop your Glock 17 down into the holster, the pistol won't come out of the holster again without you using your other hand to restrain it while pulling the pistol out. If you don't use your other hand to grip the holster you will not ever pull the pistol out, but rather just pull your pants up to the point that you are giving yourself a wedgie. That's how strongly this holster grips the Glock 17.I'm sure it's possible to stretch or break the holster in somehow even if it's hard and solid plastic, but if Fobus had just put two damned little adjustable screws at the edge instead of two bolts, the problem would be solved. Do not buy this holster."
5,SUPER AWESOME,"if you love dnd, you will love conan. the game is more violent, and you can still have hard core roleplaying too!!! it has a power point system for spells, and the type of spells are way differant than dnd, better. the game is set up to have no negative effects from game play by having a group of all soldiers or all scholars, the game is awesome like that holmes, buy it see you later G!"
5,LUVIT,"All our PT's love this lotion, easy to clean up if spilled and won't stain patients clothing and no offensive ordor"
3,what the !,"3 and 1/2 stars. The clipper attachment is bigger than it looks. And it's not easy to attach to your clippers (gotta manhandle it). And, yeah, its flimsy but I can live with it. It does it's job.That aside.. $8.80 for shipping?!!!$4.99 for the product, $8.80 for shipping... so buyer beware. It's beyond ridiculous. I wish I could have bought this from Wahl direct."
1,Wahl Garbage!,Garbage Whale product soft rubber can not be used.Love there clippers but this is just sad.
2,A bad choice for beginning Windows programming,"This book gets two stars only because of the appendix, which was a decent C++ tutorial. However, for learning Windows programming, this book is awful. It uses MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), which is a terrible place to start. Even Microsoft won't use this technology.I recommend 'Windows NT 4 Programming from the Ground Up', by Herb Schildt. It uses the Windows API functions, which is a must learn for any Windows programmer. Also, I recommend exploring other books for C++ tutorial. Jesse Liberty's 'Learn C++ in 21 days' book is a decent book if you are just getting started. This book should be called 'Learn MFC programming in 21 days', as the current title is quite misleading."
2,Not advise for serious programmer,"I am computer science student who program in C, C++, VB and java for years. The book can be condense into probably 3-5 chapter, but the author use 800 pages 21 chapter to finish it. A lot of repetition, lack of depth, lack of explanation. Teach you the form (step by step)but no substances(why you do it). It cover only VC basic tool but none of other important tool like debugger. You will learn more from online tutorial Scribble than this book."
5,Excellent drama the whole family can enjoy,"I originally saw this movie beause I enjoy Costner's acting, and I got a bonus with a well developed storyline and great supporting cast. There is subthemes of poverty and racism, but the strong hand of this movie is relationships and how challenging, complicating, and rewarding they can be. The situations in life children face with friends, and parents face with economics are raised and I believe the movie can provoke educated discussion between parent and children viewers. The movie is appropriately rated as PG-13, there are issues of Death and violence, but the love and the joy that is also experienced makes me highly recommend this movie as an opportunity to share a viewing experience with the whole family."
2,Overly sentimental and predictable,"Wanted to like the movie more, but it is entirely too sentimental, predictable, and pat -- you can watch it and say ""Oh, here's where the dad gets to redeem himself"" or ""Guardian angel talk -- guess one of them will end up dead"" or ""Aha, the conflict between the kids mirrors the dad's war"", and on and on. Got tired of being beat over the head with entirely obvious parallels and symbolisms. Kevin Costner was way too clean-cut and well-dressed to come across as an impoverished Vietnam vet with PTSD. On a more positive note, Elijah Wood was quite good; his southern accent was a lot better than Costner's. And the movie effectively conveys the mood of a hot, rural summer with almost no parental supervision. Note to parents: There's a lot of violence between children in this movie, and one extremely tense scene involving a decrepit water tower. I won't be showing it to my kids (age 3 and 6)."
4,A good film,"The War is a good, but a bit dark and sad film. This is certainly not the mainstream, so do not look for a happy ending. But if you are looking for a film which makes you think a lot about it afterwards, in which the characters continue to live their lives in your mind, the film with a thoughtfulness and beauty in it, also conveying strong messages - then the War is for you.The storyline is good and interesting, although a bit sad. But I wouldn't call it a hard film, watching is not disturbing at all. Amazing acting, of course, adds a lot to this film. Little Elijah Wood is simply amazing, Cavin Costner is adorable. I gave it 4 stars because I usually prefer more cheerful films, but apart from this sad aspect, this film is a beautiful and worhty experience."
4,Profiles in courage,"The war is a Kevin Costner movie, which is to say its a tad too long, and is likely to give you food for thought.The War is a movie my wife and I have watched several times, and always come away moved. ""The War"" is the Story of a veteran who comes home from Viet Nam damaged with PTSD, in a time when help was not available, and the stigma of mental health disorders was considerable. It is the story of a boy who is conflicted between loving and being ashamed of his father. It is a story of poverty as a great equalizer, and of friendship. Finally it is a story about courage and cowardice in many forms.So here's the deal, this isn't a fun movie, it isn't entertaining, but it is a moving tale that will give you things to think about."
2,Not suitable for 60+,"Would strongly discourage anyone over age 60 from purchasing this product...way too tough routine and moves too fast for older gals. Inadequate time to learn the routine. I gave it a full 30 days but decided to return it based on this assessment. It's a shame because I love other FIRM products. The theory behind the program is sound, but really does cater to younger girls."
1,too chaotic,"I already work out, and am in pretty good shape. The videos, did make me sweat, and I did feel it the next day. The only problem I had was, the instructors, just jumped into the routine without showing you the moves. I felt like I missed the toturial class. Once I figured out on move, they jumped to a different one. Perhaps I am just too uncoordinated, to do these videos. Needless to say, I returned them."
5,I am a Firm Believer now!!,"I have a few The Firm Dvds and have not been impressed with any of the workouts. I barely break a sweat on the 60 min. ones. I'm in excellent shape and expect a lot from my DVDs. I'm used to Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper workouts. I thought for sure I would do this workout 3 weeks and return it. So far, I did the Kickstart workout plan the first week without doing the eating part. I ate normally and lost 2 lbs. I really have only 5 to lose (perfection, right?). I was impressed with how I was sweating after only a 20 minute workout. This week I'm doing the week one DVDs mixing in a workout on T/Th too though. I still love them! Finally The Firm has done it. I love all the DVDs so far. I can't wait to see the results after 5 weeks of doing these. I totally recommend this workout kit!!! Good luck!"
3,Wonderful video for the younger population... 50 or below....,The Firm is a wonderful program for those age 50 and younger. I tried it and my old bones did not like the jumping around so much. I sent it to my 36 year old daughter and she is so excited!
3,Hard to follow along,"The monthly program set-up is ideal and fun, but I find this program very difficult to follow along. I end up standing there dumbfounded the whole time because they explain the movements before you do them. You are expected to just follow along. But they move SO fast and by the time you figure out how to do the exercise - they are on to the next movement. I think I'm going to try Jillian Micheals 30 day shred next. Or I will see if the Firm has any other monthly workout programs, because I heard they have other DVDs that are better."
1,worst workout ever,there is absolutly no way you could ever loose weight doing this workout everyday let alone only three times per week you don't even get your heart rate up to a workout level until it's almost over and the mini burst moves aren't moves you can do properly at a fast pace without loosing form and injuring yourself and even the first week workouts have you trying to change the move they just showed you before you even repeat it so it's hard to follow along worst of all if you order on amazon you can't even return this worthless product unless it's unopened so if you absolutly feel like you should try this product i suggest paying a few dollars more so you have the free trial period
3,Not impressed.,"I am on the third week of the workout and have not lost one pound. I can barely keep up,instructions are short and quick, and the modified verison does not exist. It's like you're watching fast forward for 20 minutes in hopes you can keep up."
2,Not worth it,"I really want to like this workout series, but if you are not quick to catch onto to moves none of The Firm DVD's are for you. The instructors do not give enough demonstration or instructions on the moves until they are actually doing them. I end up having to stop and watch the moves performed, then when I feel I have finally got it down they move on. I am frustrated because I do not feel I am getting a good workout because I am not able to continuously perform the exercises. Maybe if you have more patience The Firm DVD's would be good for you."
1,Tempted to switch over to MS Word,"As a steadfast user of Wordperfect for several years, I had hoped to continue this good relationship with the newest version. Instead, I have found frustration and feel that I am better acquainted with the ""recovery wizard"" that any of the ""new and improved"" features of this product. Frustrations abound as the program crashes once, twice, dozens of times as I attempt to go about my daily work. These crashes do not occur as I attempt to utilize the more sophisticated features; merely attempting to open a file seems to befuddle this flawed program. Is it just me or do others out there feel that the Corel company computers must be filled to bursting with their recovery wizard reports?Good luck with the rebates. I'm still waiting for my Corel rebate that I mailed in June."
5,Poetry Fitting Into My Life,"My favorite poem was ""footprints"". My grandfather passed away in May and he was my mentor. In a sense I tried to follow in his footsteps. The poems in this book are about real life situations whether it is directly speaking or indirectly. It is easy to understand what the author is talking about because you could easily fit it into your own life."
2,To quote the author...,"""Forming the shape of a bonsai can be a very individual subject and therefore it is very difficult for me to convey my ideas to you.""While the author is undoubtedly a talented bonsai gardener, and may well be a good teacher 'at the elbow', his informal jargon may leave the reader puzzled, and his concept of 'dimensional drawings' for tree planning is still unclear, despite numerous example drawings."
2,Not a great source of information,I expected much more out of this book. I bought '101 Essential Tips: Bonsai' at Border's for $5 and got much more pertinent information for my Juniper.
2,Radio good Sound Bad,Bought this because I wanted an easy way to connect my ipod to a boombox. The speakers are horrible. It only gets FM no AM. Plays everything at almost the same volume. Turn the music up and there is way too much distortion. Turn the music down and the speakers simply cut out. Returning it today
5,Great Design/Sound,"I bought the iBoom for my brother on Christmas. He absolutely loves it!! I tried it out myself with my iPod mini, and it works great!! I was surprised that the sound was so clear and crisp. It would be cool if the iBoom had a remote control and bass options, but I still give it 5 stars. For a portable device, it works for us!! I know that some people have had problems with it, but we haven't. We ordered it from Computer Brain through Amazon and have had no complaints."
2,Whats the hissing?,"So I was super stoked to finally get this in the mail. However, I plugged it in and immediating, it starts makes noise. I though that if I dropped my ipod into it, it would stop. No, no it didnt. Its some kinda hissing. So I cant really judge the sound quality cause it has a white noise. The kinda noise you used to hear when your stereo was up loud and the you were in between tracks on a cassette tape.Lastly, pet peeves: it has 2 power buttons, on for the unit and one for the fm radio. The dock isnt tight, and when you pull a 4g ipod out of the dock, it doesnt pause like it should. The knobs and buttons are cheap. GRRRRR. I already sent it back to amazon.I gave it 2 stars cause I did like the size and the ergonomics, it is visually pleasing and a great idea for the ipod."
2,NOT FOR OFFICE USE,"Like many other reviewers, I bought this unit with the intent of being able to play my ipod softly while working. However, there is not ""soft"" volume on this at all. If your in a quiet office, it is much too loud to even turn on. Everything else about the iBoom is good and I'm keeping it because overall I am happy with it and will be able to use it on my deck, at the beach, or in the kitchen. But if your looking only for something for the office, do not buy this, look for alternatives."
3,cheap but convenient,"I purchased this compass to use for making orienteering maps. The main problem is that the needle is very shaky, but it is nevertheless possible to sight accurate bearings. The other drawback is that it has no straight-edge, and only a small window of transparency, so you really need a separate angle tool to plot bearings on a map. The two big plusses are the price and the compactness."
3,Helpful if you're confused about big words ending in 'ism',"Most academic reviewers criticized the book for including made-up 'isms' and funny quotations. Mark Twain: ""In the first place God created school boards. This was for practice. Then He created idiots."" But the authors tackle complicated concepts pertaining to economics, philosophy, religion and art in a common sense, down to earth way. Get a copy to understand marginal utilitarianism (and lots of other terms) in less than 5 minutes flat."
4,Into a Dark Realm,"This is a good Feist piece of work. It does not live up the Riftwar Saga, but the Magician series was by far his finest works. However, Feist is beginning to introduce and utilize many new characters. For many this will be a welcome change. I enjoyed Feist's other series that leveraged new characters. The Tsurani series was great.The Conclave is still at the heart of the book so those with attachment to Pug and Nakor will find them plenty to keep you interested.All in all, I recommend this book."
4,Wow! The plot has really thickened...,"This addition the series provided a lot of answers and information! The Second Circle is fascinating and though overall rather horrific, the new characters make for an interesting change of pace. Enough old characters balance out the new, making them more of the focus. Unfortunately, some of the plot devices were a bit predictable. Still the overall sense of buildup is rising and the absolute cliffhanger of an ending makes it nearly impossible to stop reading. I can't imagine being one of the readers who waited a whole year for the next installment! I wouldn't have the patience!"
3,A well written book on Whitney Houston .,"Good girl, Bad girl was a well written book on Whitney Houston, but unfortunately the book was unauthorized and none of us know if any of the information was true. I will say that many of his comments were true, I know because I am a true Whitney Houston fan. Getting to the contents of the rest of the book I liked it,Ammons words seemed truely sincere he seemed to know information only some one close to Whitney would know. I gave this book 2 stars, because it is an unauthorized, so for that I took I took away some stars."
5,Phillips delivers a potent wake-up call,"I found Phillips' analysis of financial market focus verses manufacturing and what it portends for US hegemony veryinteresting. Consider the number of industries that, thanks to NAFTA and the WTO, are increasingly being lost to China and Mexico. This type of economic policy is good for the top 1% club that will benefit by financing foreign industry. Once these industries are lost they won't be coming back in our lifetimes. How many articles of clothing or consumer electronic goods are manufactured in the US?Phillips also brings to light the extraordinary power wielded by the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan. How is it that someone who has never appeared on a ballot can wield so much powerin a democratic nation?Perhaps all the confusing statistics and abstruse pronouncementsfrom the Fed constitute a convenient farrago that shields elected officials from being voted out of office by the 99% of the population who haven't paid for their services."
1,Save your money,"All you need do is talk to anyone from a low payed janitor or factory worker toa corporate executive trying to keep up with the Joneses (but failing).Listen everytime somebody complains about being passed over for a promotion or pay raise. Check out their jealousy and envy at anyone who is successful and ask them what is the difference between them and the successful and you will have the content of this book. Best of all, it will be, unlike this book--FREE!Don't waste your money on this. Just talk to anybody who is not doing that well and is making we cracks about those who are. You'll get the same information."
2,Absurd conclusions,"It is totally absurd to assume that the top 1% have more political power. Think about it, who has more voting power, the top 1% who number in the minority or the remaining 99% who make up the majority?I also found the comments about Jack Welch utterly ridiculous by a reviewer here. No doubt, this revewer is a democrat who dislikes Welch because Mr. Welch was one of the first prominent CEO's to approach then newly elected President Bush to explain the sorry state of the economy, why GE had to layoff masses and was having great difficulty making profits while Bill Clinton was still in office and before GWII was sworn in.Some people can't see the forrest from the trees and act like your head is in the ground. You know which end sticks out don't you?"
2,Hard Ground,"In your school English compositions did you craft long, elegant sentences that furthered your argument in a oh-so-clever way? Did your teacher tell you that your sentences were too long? Well, this guy writes the way you think you should be able to. And he gets published! So there! But seriously; working my way through this book I had to reread sentence after sentence, paragraph after paragraph. When exposed to Mr. Phhillips acute analysis, my most common thought was; huh? I'm sure that there is a good point in this book but it eluded me. I vote for Mr. Phillips to go back to English class."
2,Not a good use of my time,"My Spanish is pretty good but I got the course to try to increase my fluency. I used just the cassettes while biking. I got both levels.On the positive side, the quality of the sound is excellent.On the negative side, the course is committed to endless seemingly mindless boring substitution drills that seems to have the effect of short-term rote learning. This strikes me like mostly a waste of time. Has any scholar verified that the method really works?The much better approach is Pimsleur's, which consists mostly of back and forth translations (model dialogue, then translation from Spanish to English, then Spanish to English translation of the same dialogue). That seems much, much more useful.So I say: go with the Pimsleur method."
4,It will grow on You,"Have you ever had a CD that you started to play and just felt like it was strictly average, only to play it a second time when you are in tune to find out that the music was really good?That is what this CD did for me. I did not fully appreciate it the first time I played it but then I had a chance to not be distracted and the music was simply awesome.From start to finish this CD takes you through several transitions from Smooth Jazz to Be Bop to Old school and back to Smooth Jazz. And boy does it have a flair. Jeff has outdone himself this time. The CD is really really well constructed and well put together. It is like fine wine that gets better everytime you hear it."
3,John carries on...,"John Oliva carries on the torch of old Savatage. If you're a fan of old Savatage you should enjoy this release as it will be familiar territory. Three stars rather than five because there is a bit less of a band sound, and a bit more of a solo sound. Anyway, this is a good release the first song ""Through the Eyes of the King"" is never eclipsed throughout the rest of the C.D. however."
4,Perfect Intro...,"Not knowing anything about SQL, I was able to read this book and get a running start.The book is easy to search and find information. Although I did not require anything too fancy, I was able to build a database, tables, filter and query all from reading this book.I am sure there are much more sophisticated texts, but if you are looking to go from no experience to a working knowledge in an hour, this is a great book."
2,"Unorganised, sparse, and erratic","This was laying around the office and I needed to pick up SQL so I gave it a whirl. [I would have never have choosen any programming book with the phrase 'in 10 Minutes' in the title! What a crock.]I typically work in IDL and Perl and need to add a bit of mySQL.To me reading this book is like trying to follow the path of a running squirrel. It's jumping all over the place. The thoughts are unclear and lack flow. It's supposed to be a primer but in the scatter shot approach it really makes a mess and winds up missing the connection between points.I'm looking for something better, and it's certain to take longer than 10 minutes."
2,Not what I expected,"This booklet gives you instructions on how to run different SQL commands, and it does so by just throwing you the rigid command lines. You want run a JOIN script? here's the syntax, go for it.It doesn't even give you a scenario and explain to you WHY the script should be written in that way.I would recommand Joes 2 Pros' Beginner SQL: http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-SQL-Joes-Pros-Hands-/dp/143925317X/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1286860133&sr;=1-4"
4,Concise Introduction to SQL,"This book is a well-written, well-organized, concise introduction to SQL. Each of the 22 lessons takes about 10 minutes to complete. The same files are used throughout and are available from the author's Web site. Using these files and the author's numerous examples, one can learn SQL step-by-step as painlessly as possible.There is one deficiency, though. Appendix E lists all SQL Reserved Words, but doesn't provide the exact syntax to use (for different DBMS's) or examples. Correcting this would subtantially increase the size of the book but would be extremely useful for reference."
4,Sams Does It Again,"Clear and concise, Ben Forta's teaching experience shines with the knowledge reinforcement layout; this edition has been superseded by a 4th Edition which made this book very affordable.Recommended"
3,not the standard,a tad smaller than expected. holds maybe 20#. The zippers are flimsy. Good for occasional backyard use but not for heavy event use. strap is good. :) material in kinda thin but hasnt ripped. Cant say the same for the bottom seams. Now leaking sand. ehh
4,Not bad.,"I agree with the previous review, as the item(s) don't fit standard bulb receptacles, nor the opening in the taillight assembly. But if you have a dremel & a hot glue gun, it's worth the trouble. I put 2 on my van and believe me, they're LOUD! Just one is enough to let people know your backing-up, plus there much brighter than the regular bulbs! But make no mistake, this item IS a ""Handyman special""."
1,Uninteresting Mediocre Play,"""The Tempest"" is the least interesting Shakespeare play I have read. ""Macbeth,"" ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and ""Othello"" were much more thrilling.""The Tempest"" seems like it's lost somewhere between a tragdy and a comedy. I couldn't tell which characters I should empathize with, and teh only emotion it gave me was ""meh."" In the back of the book it's listed as a romance, which is surprising since the romance is a minor part of the story.The only way ""The Tempest"" can work is if very good actors play the parts. By just reading it, the main character Prospero is very ambiguous, as to whether he is benevolent or malevolent. It probably takes a good actor to interpret him just right, to capture the audience's emotions. Unfortunately, the film I saw had horrible actors, all overacting to their limits, and that just made my opinion of this play even lower.Sure, there is some social commentary in the play. But all in all, I was expecting more from Will."
5,this guitar will rock you......!!!!,i love this guitar it has a perfect sound but you should get new strings and a strap the amp if you set5 it right there is no buzzing
5,'latest disgrace',"The dvd is fantastic - go buy it now.I usually don't buy DVDs of bands playing live, but after much deliberation I decided to splurge - hoping that it would at least be as good as the concert I watched them play last year at MSG.The band is awesome at Slane. Their chemsity is evident from start through finish and it permeates the crowd as well as the viewer. Each one of the Peppers is amazing to watch but, as most reviews have pointed out, John F. is just mezmerizing.As fantastic as the whole DVD is, the most amazing part of the show is when they play the intro to Fugazi's ""Latest Disgrace"". I've read no reference to it in the other reviews but watching RHCP play that (so amazingly well!) was unexpected and breathtaking."
3,Kiedis Live Can not sing. The band sounds good. Cheap DVd,"I like the chilli peppers, And i particulary liked their last album ""By the way"".This Dvd is full of songs from By the way. Reason why i bought it. And i paid the 17 dollars.Kiedis, Singing live is really bad. He has no voice at all.It made me feel really bad. Because the songs in the album sound great. And were sing great too. But live. Singer sucks.The Guitar player is really good. As in the album. He is really creative. And he does a great job. Flea, is a good musician. But his clown approach sometimes makes you take him less seriously.I will close this way.If you are a Blind fan of the chilli peppers. Buy it.If you like their last album. then, do not buy this Dvd. Cause you wont feel good about this.I gave this Dvd to my brother to take to argentina with him. (so i will try to forget this bad experience, and keep listening to the CD which is great.).I wish you all find this as a helping guide.Leandro.Miami Beach- Usa."
5,A real page turner,"So I'm home sick with the flu, with hardly enough energy to pick up a book. Fortunately, the book I picked up -- Foamers, by Jon Berson -- was enormously engrossing! Berson has crafted an exciting story with appealing characters; the plot moves briskly without being predictable, and the history of trains and transportation policy is interpreted accurately without the dryness that accompanies most such accounts. Once I started the book, it was very difficult to put it down; I finished it in about 24 hours. Foamers was a welcome tonic for a guy on his sickbed!Josh Silverma"
5,Best Book that I have read on Janis,"I have read most of the books written on Janis (with the exception of ""Love, Janis""). ""Pearl"" is the book that I have liked the most. Author interviewed an impressive number of persons from both Port Arthur and Frisco. Interviewees included former High School friends, members of Big Brother and Kris Kristofferson. Discovered some facts about JJ that I was not aware of. I hope these facts are true. I do not want to disclose any of unknown (to me) facts so I don't spoil other readers enjoyment. I LOVED this book."
5,It's the perfect gift to show how much you appreciate her.,"If you want to show a special girlfriend just how much you appreciate her, I suggest you purchase this book and then go through and highlight all the significant parts that describe your friendship with her. It is guaranteed to bring a tear to her eye. It did mine."
1,Disappointed,"My grandson has been anxiously awaiting this CD.We sat down to watch it only to have it constantlystick at certain points.......we tried moving it aheadbut it would immediately go back to the beginning.All in all a frustrating experience. By the way, it'sa filmsy recording in a flimsy box..........almost like one that is made off market.We should really get a replacement from Amzon."
2,Save the World...again?,"This is probably my favorite of all the Pokemon movies (I watch them about once a year) because it has Lugia and the Legendary Birds. Just that, Lugia gets beat up SO many times, and then magically comes back when an instrument is played. I wish ASH could mind his own business for once and not save the world...for the umpteenth time. Let's see; first Pokemon: Ash stops the fighting. Second; He manages to bring peace to the birds because he's the ""chosen one"" (wow, I would've never guessed) Third; he gets Molly to stop the Unknown. Mewtwo Returns; he saves Mewtwo. Etc. Occasionally I wonder if these horrible movies and shows hadn't ever been made, if there would be more Pokemon TCG around. The characters just destroyed it, plain and simple."
5,good love story,i love anything with Ryan Reynolds but this had a great story and I really liked it. Recommend to everyone
4,MOVIE W/A TWIST,"I really enjoyed this movie. The little girl was the shining star. She stole the show. I believe if more people would listen to their children (minus the foul language) they would avoid a whole lot of heart & head ache. She was definitely the voice of reason which led to her father's happiness in the end w/his one true love. All men/women need to watch this movie to understand loving someone versus being in-love w/someone. Watch it, u will not regret."
5,Great Movie!,"It's been a while since I found a movie that was nice and easy to follow. This was comical and romantic, and I loved it. I had to give it 5 stars!"
5,romantic movie,I love the story line and the entire cast. I especially love Ryan Reynolds and Isla Fisher's characters.
3,Mayb-e Definitely,"Definitely, Maybe starring Ryan Reynolds and Ilsa Fisher makes you want to squeeze this film so hard that some of the magic spills out onto you. The basics of the dating scene are covered in this delightful view of learning to trust and love someone new again with the twist of being a single parent. Ryan and Ilsa do not disapoint with plenty of emotional highs and lows that will keep you wondering if this new love will be definitely or maybe."
2,Maybe skip this one?,"Definitely, Maybe is a fairly inoffensive rom/com starring Ryan Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fischer, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz, and Kevin Kline. Will Hayes (Reynolds) is getting a divorce. His daughter, Maya (Breslin), begs him to tell her how he and her mother met. After some persuasion, Will complies, telling the story of his love affairs with three different women. (The catch is that Maya must guess which one turned out to be her mother.)Performances were all fine, though I did feel that the on-screen relationship (and the dailogue) between Reynolds and Breslin left much to be desired. The best parts of the movie were the dramatizations of Will's past. The film slowed down every time we stepped back into the present, at least until the very end of the film.The only performer who really shined in this film was Fischer. No wonder the girl's a rising star.Not a must-see."
3,Definitely Rent It!,"Ryan Reynolds is one of my favorite actors so it always disappoints me when one of his films doesn't thrill me. This movie lacked plot and substance. There is a man who is going through a divorce and he is telling his young daughter about three women he dated around the time he met her mother. The little girl is supposed to guess which one by the descriptions ends up being her mother. I thought all of the actresses (with the exception of the little girl) lacked personality making it only tolerable to watch. ""Definitely, Maybe"" was okay but not worth buying before you have seen (like I tend to do). The previews show the film."
1,That Football was Spiked!,Terrible sequel is by far the worst of the series till part 4 arrived. A Canadian teen named Alex is failing school and having trouble on the football team and then Mary Lou comes back to Hamilton High and then makes Alex popular and then he buries the dead bodies in the football field. This movie is a waste of time and only has one funny scene where Mary Lou throws a football at the bully and a spike stabs him.
2,this has got to be the stupidest movie ever made!,"what?What? How could anyone give this movie five stars. It was the worst movie ever made. How could they take the prom night franchise and turn it into some lame horror movie. It's ridiculous. The plot was dumb and pointless and the one-liners absolutely not funny. The movie was a disgusting mix of sex and violence, that tried to hard to be funny and failed. this is definitely the most pointless movie and the worstsequel ever. DUMB! just plain dumb! The ending completely ruined even the few(1 or two) good parts in the movie."
2,"Protector Good, Adhesive bad","The adhesive will ruin your screen. I don't understand why you are going to pay 20 dollars to ""protect"" your screen when it's in fact not helping you at all. I bought them and then heard that they were tough to put on. I still tried but, it is very difficult. I would reccommend going to the compaq website and going under ipaq accessories. They sell them there for 16 dollars with screen protectors without adhesive. Also this does not increase sensitivity, it reduces it. How is something like this going to actually increase it? Well i'll leave it up to you if you want to destroy your screen."
3,Somewhat disappointed,Heard some of Sia's stuff from Zero 7 and decided to try this CD. Listened to it once and was somewhat irritated by the nasal lingering notes/moans.
5,Down Home funny,This book is filled with hilarious Maritimers - you'll recognize them! There are hilarious and heartbreaking moments as one young man's idolatry betrays him inch by inch.
1,disappointed,"i used these tongs only once, and i was shocked to see the upper lock nob break just after cleaning it.. i don't know if i can get it fixed, because i had it shipped outside the US.. great disappointment.."
3,Not as good as the Life Application Bible,"I ordered this Bible because I wanted a new study Bible. I got it in, and the quality of the construction, pages etc is all fine. (One small note about that though, they don't have the book listed at the end of the pages it's toward the middle which makes it inconvenient for flipping through trying to find a specific verse quickly.) But the bottom line is the study notes are not very detailed. I had been borrowing my sister's Life Application Study Bible, which had fantastic notes. So I'm returning the Quest and have ordered the Life Application. If I'd never seen the Life Application Bible I might have been satisfied with it, but since you have the choice I'd go with Life Application. I've heard the NIV Study Bible is very good too, but I haven't had direct experience with it and I don't want to waste more money on return shipping if I ended up deciding that I still wanted the Life Application."
1,I Do not Recommend this book for people who has homosexual feelings,"I thought this would be a very good study bible but I was verydisappointed at the insensitivity and lack of multiple perspective ofpeople who have homosexual feelings. I think some of the interpretationsare one-sided and that it was written by people who do not struggle withhomosexual feelings. In other words, it is very biased. It needs to takea more multiple perspective but it doesn't. I felt I wasted my moneybuying this book."
5,There Are So Many Things I Want to Know,"..and this Bible is just incredible - I want to know the history. I want to know what cultural influences there were in the days of Isaiah, Abraham, King David, Moses, Jacob - ALL of THEM - what DROVE them. I want to know the history. I want to know the original CONTEXT from the first language. I want to know what GOD wants to show me, and I've already found so much, and I've barely had this Bible a week! The colors of the cover are just beautiful (I have the teal/brown Bible), with a very nice soft feel."
3,Amazon in Germany,Why is Amazon treating their employees like slaves in GermanyI like the cast better when I did not know them as well.
2,Save your money,This dvd is very expensive for what you get. The cast looks uncomfortable to be there. The first half is mostly the moderator gushing. There are only a few audience questions. I am sorry that I bought this for a gift for a person who loves the show. They were dissapointed.
1,Lousy,"This cd player was yet another failure for us. The cd player simply stopped working after a very short period. And the radio reception is poor.It doesn't seem to matter how much one pays for disc players. We have yet to find a single brand that is durable.Possibly Citizen has other, good units. But this one was terrible. It lasted less than six months."
4,More than your usual fishing guide,"Before a recent trip to Florida for some inshore fishing, I purchased several guide books of which this was the best. In what other Florida fishing book does the author bother to provide an entertaining background on the geological history that produced the Florida coastal flats? There is a light dusting of cornball humor, but it only makes a very informative book a bit more fun to read. Highly recommended."
3,Not a bad tool but it does brake easy,Not a bad tool. We really like them for jobbing and punch list. We have broken two regulators so far and what we have discovered is you need to stay with the 9oz bottles. The larger 20oz are to heavy to clip you your belt and men tend to put them on the floor where they fall over and crack the regulator. I ended up just getting a 100lb bottle of CO2 and the fill kit. for 150$ the we fill our own bottle in the shop for a lot cheaper then the lumber yard was. I just wish they would make the regulator tougher.
2,Not a childrens book,"To re-state what to me what was completely obvious, but from reading a review here must not be so:People... This is NOT a childrens' coloring book. It is for ADULTS.An innocent childs mind is not the place to exercise political beliefs. Let children be children and let them decide for themselves.That said, this book is a bit funny and a good gag gift for a Bush hater, or even funnier, for a Bush lover.Crayons would be optional ;)"
4,Good value,The costume seems to be more durable than most costumes--no funky velcro or 'cheesy' sewing. I thought it was a good value if your child wants to be batman.
2,Too high-level,I expected this book to be a good technical reference (much like just about every other Sam's Teach Yourself book). The book fails to deliver technical information and is primarily focused on how to perform tasks when USING Sharepoint that just about anyone who can read and click would be able to figure out without the help. This book is overly simplistic and is targeted to the END USER who is not even familiar with using Internet Explorer (several pages spent on what the different features of IE are).
3,Just wasnt for me,"I would have liked to see more actual instruction on HOW to do the moves correctly. This video used a pole alot, which I dont have. It really stressed on rubbing yourself ALOT. The most of the video was geared towards just swirling around touching yourself."
4,Good Show,"I saw this show on MTV when it was still prime time and when they were still very much in love. It's a good show I would put it right up there with The NewlyWeds. I think the price is ridiculous though but someone will buy it only because if you have never seen it, it is intriguing and you honestly can't find it anywhere. It's NewlyWeds Goth style!"
5,Camaro Rock's Finest,"This album set the standard for my pre-teen fascination with hair metal. Best of all, it was hair metal about Autobots and Decepticons!!!Rock on!!! This is more than meets 3 eyes!"
1,What is this?,"Is every reviewer on here still living in 1986 or what? This soundtrack shouldn't even be for sale anymore. 17 years ago everyone and their mother sported hardcore mullets, wore sweat pants, and...were obsessed with the Transformers. I'm not putting down the Transformers, but pop culture had not a hint of sense throughout most of the 80s. I'd recommend listening to a few samples off this CD before doing anything crazy like buying it. Do you think I bought it? Oh no, the samples were enough to make me sick. But if they don't make you nauseous, I can guarantee you'll be laughing. In particular, listen to The Touch by Stan Bush. What was this guy thinking? I bet he's pretty ashamed of himself today if he's still alive. The song's also funny because Mark Wahlberg performed it in Boogie Nights as a mockery. At least Mark realized his music career was a joke. Do you want to wake up one day and realize your music collection is a joke too? Do yourself a favor and avoid this CD."
5,Found Memories,"As a kid whenever I heard the touch I knew The Autobots were on there way to a victory no matter the cost. I've fallen in love with the CD, constantly listening to it in the car. Also if you are like me you'll remember scene bt scene when you listen. Found memories and heroic sounds. A classic."
5,great album... the touch is awesome,if ur a fan of the transformers and like rock music... this is an awesome album
2,Good for kids,"When I was a kid, I loved this soundtrack. It was the coolest thing I heard. But I grew up. I ""matured"" from this album. No, this isn't your ""Barney""-type album. This is heavy metal - by a bunch of no-names. Oh sure, ""Weird Al"" is on here, and ya gotta dig him, but he can't save this album with ""Dare To Be Stupid"". While the music worked perfectly for the movie, none of it is exactly ""good"". The best stuff on this soundtrack is by Vince DiCola. Everything else is your stereotypical 80's fair."
3,rehash and one interview,The book is an extremely readable book . My major complaint seems to be that it is a rehash of previous boks such as the Rosenberg File by Ron Radosh and Implosion Conspiracy by Nizor. The only original research is at the end of the book in which Roberts is granted an interview with david Greenglass. There were many questions that could have been asked. Greenglass seems to be in current money difficulties and may be twisting events of long ago to suit his current needs. Greenglass appears to be operating under the assumption that Roberts will give him a favorable portrayal. Roberts shows the negative side of what Greenglss did. If true that the government had David make aallegations about Ethel it is a sobering display of prosecutorial misconduct. Robert does not comment on the implication od this and this should be a cental component (if true) on the historical commentary of this case.
2,I Was disappointed,"I enjoyed the previous two books about Sea City and thought I would like this one but turned out it wasnt what i thought. It wasn't very deep, and I found the part about Hurricane Bill very dull. Besides, why on earth would Logan want to hang out with a pack of girls in Sea City? He had no business there unless his buddies were going. Also I don't think boys should be baby-sitters. I'm not prejudiced, I just know that things get out of hand when theres a boy baby-sitter. Remember the thing with Michael Jackson? I was kinda glad that Stacey ditched Toby, who turned out to be a bad apple when he ditched her in Mary Anne & too many Boys. He was a dork, anyway!"
1,Didn't care for this one.,"This movie was a great disappointment. The animation was average, there were none of the rich textured backgrounds usually found in Ralph Bakshi films. I didn't care for the story at all."
2,crumb ripoff!,"i started liking this movie, i thought the pinball metaphor and wild characters and lifes a cartoon shiz could have worked out, if it werent for the fact that bakshi is thinly disguising himself and his own frustration as being an unoriginal ""underground"" cartoonist who caught on to the scene too late...if you like the depressing, gritty, wild, fastpaced style of this movie, check out the original master ROBERT CRUMB, toward whom bakshi is obviously seething with jealousy and riding anxiously on the coattails of...this is crap in noncomformity, and dont say i ""didnt get it"", i just think hes being hugely self-indulgent and this whole thing is an homage gone awry, lacking the wit, psychedelia, and pornographic brillinace that crumb could create so effortlessly.."
1,"Wow, what a load!","I read this book for a class at the fictitious ""Grove School"" as described by Robert Bingham in his text ""Lightning on the Sun."" I am confident in saying that it is only good as a conversation starter with stupid people. In any event, please avoid this book and all other such literature. Huzzah!"
3,Here's one for you...,"Worship the Virgin Mary = IDOLATRY.A priest cannot forgive you of your sins. Only God can.Bingo in the church = Christ kicked the gamblers, etc. our of the temple(church).Hello people??? Is anyone home?"
4,Saved me time and money!,The bella band in the best! It has saved me time and money because I hate shopping for maternity clothes! It is easy to use!
1,Proof that BS is recursive,"A book like this doesn't merit much of a review. Not because it is short and brief, but because it is vacuous. The author's musings on BS could have been put together in a half-page for the New Yorker. The main conclusion of the book is that people BS because they want to impress others and thereby magnify their stature both publicly and privately. This is neither new information resulting from novel argumentation nor even well analysed in the text. By the way the book is 67 pages long with double spacing throughout, and only the size of pocket diary. I give this information to help quantify the BS it contains. Having read it, I concluded that it was a complete waste of my money."
4,Not a bad start,"No question about it there is a lot of bullsh*t out there. Much of it comes from advertising, some from public relations, and, more recently, the closely related realm of politics. The trouble is that most of us contribute to the problem and tend to take the situation for granted. Too bad! Reality, that jade, will make us pay, and pay a lot. For that's what happens when we pay more attention to the appearances than to the facts. The classic bullsh*ter needs to be contrained, called on the carpet, and made to repent. Else our civilization is in serious doo-doo. This little book (67 pages)is a good start in alerting us to the problem, but it gives no ready solutions. For solutions we have to look elsewhere. May I suggest: ""Truth, Knowledge, or Just Plain Bull: A handbook of Practical Logic and clear thinking"" a book by a neurologist turned logician who tries to get a clear cut handle on not only the problem of Bullsh*t but also the solution."
1,Academic Trivia,"Frankfurt begins trying to define the term, drawing from the Oxford English Dictionary and various authors, and similar terms such as ""bull-session,"" ""shooting the bull,"" ""humbug,"" and ""hot air.""Unfortunately, since there is no clearly agreed-upon definition of the term, Frankfut's hair-splitting efforts to clarify it come to naught. However, he did clarify why there is so much b-s - it is the unavoidable result of people needing to talk about something they little or nothing about. In other words, the combination of today's complexities and our shallow educations.Interesting reading in the bookstore (if you have nothing else to do and are trying to impress those around you), but not worth buying."
5,This is great discourse on a topic everyone is an expert on.,This is great discourse on a topic everyone is an expert on.
2,Don't waste your money,After the first few paragraphs there is nothing left to say. The title's cute but this book turns out to be only an extended definition of the word. Who needs it?
2,Well Titled,"This was a quick read (30-40 minutes) and was itself filled with bulls**t. I thought an academic could have done more on the subject. Save yourself a few dollars by not buying it. If you want to read it, request a copy at your local library. It's not something you're going to want to have on your bookshelf for the long term."
3,Interesting Bit of BullSh**,"I also learned about this book after seeing the author on The Daily Show. Yes, the book is quite short, but the sentences are loooooong. Big words and long, meandering sentences. At one point I turned to my friend and said that I felt the author was actually being ironic by littering his text with so much BS (or ""fluff""). Maybe that was the point. A lesson on BS rife with BS. Worth reading? Sure. And it fits in your pocket or purse for a perfect waiting-room time passer."
3,B.S. About B.S.,"Kind of fun, kind of dry. It's a bit academic to be a satire or truly funny. But I think for those willing to settle down, pay attention, and allow their brain to follow line of reasoning, that this essay will be illuminating and worth the time. That's easy to say since the work is, somewhat thankfully, rather short.It's good to finally know and understand why I like b.s. but not lying!"
1,Exemplifies Better Than It Explicates,Frankfurt pens a few dozen pages to convey what he could have edited down to much less ... and still he fails to illuminate anything but his own artifice.Ambrose Bierce ya ain't.
1,Philosophical B.S. - Tossed it in the Garbage,Was hoping to find a good practical guide to spot B.S. tactics. Instead got philosphical-speak. Title is ironic. I feel like I was B.S.'d into buying the book. First to toss of dozens of business and behavior books I've purchased over the past couple of years.
4,Good item,I purchased this for the extra Mag that came with my Taurus PT111. I really like Fobus products. I purchased the Gun paddle a few months ago and loved it. The Mag does fit in but is a little tighter than I expected. I would have given it 5 stars if there was an adjustement screw (like the Gun paddle). It does what it is supposed to though.
3,Does not fit Glock mags,"The product itself is great and would work well, but the description of ""Universal"" is incorrect. It is for Beretta and a few other brands, but does NOT fit Glock double stack mags."
5,Excellent Chips,"Fantastic chips but they weren't packaged for shipping as well as they usually are, causing them to be a bit crushed."
1,God's Eternal Purpose More Complicated Than We Ever Imagined,"This is also listed by another seller as ""The Eternal Purpose Now Triumphing for Man's Good"". I reiterate my review under that listing:The title of this review pretty well sums up the target audience's reaction to this book (it was published as an in-house Bible study text for Jehovah's Witnesses). It is dry, disorganized, and has nothing to offer a Christian's daily life. The ONLY thing most of its readers can remember about it is the nit-picking distinction between Jehovah's ""purpose"" and Jehovah's ""plan,"" which gets far too much play. More spiritual sawdust from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.BTW, this book was offered for only a dollar when it was new in the 1980's. I can't imagine who is bidding this book up to $9 and more."
4,If you are just looking for the video...,"Buy the IMPORTED single (ASIN:B00005BIWG) with Enhanced video instead. This version contains the video (I bought both), but the import contains an enhanced version that's full-screen. I sure would like to see it compatible with a DVD player though, monitors are only so large."
2,Fatboy Slim-Star 69 Remixes,"I really wish I had thought through this CD more. I have only recently started to like Fatboy Slim when I heard his song ""Weapon of Choice"" on the radio ... I then saw the video with Christopher Walken. It was so stupid it was hilarious. When I bought this cd howver, I learned that it didn't have weapon of choice ona normal CD track, only in video format. While the video is good, all the remixes of star 69 [are bad] in my opinion. The only line is ""They know what is what, but they don't know what is what, they just strut, .... Take my advice, if you are looking for only one song,make sure you know well waht you are buying or resort to napster/gnutella!"
1,Hell's Angle 69,"Pretty lame. I am supprised that the Hell's Angles let this thing go to press. It's not even a ""want-a-be"" be biker flick. A more fitting title would be ""Little Bikers (house) on the Prairie"""
2,Hard to rate because...,"Love the product- its an awesome video, hate the part that two of three of these I purchased didn't work on disk one. The third is hard to boot up. Somebody do something!"
2,Wrong one--buy the Vanguard VS41 Flexible MiniTripod instead,"The Sunpak and Vanguard mini tripods look alike in photos, but in practice they are quite different.The Sunpak legs are hard to straighten out, as they seem to develop a ""memory"" of being bent.The Vanguard legs are a much higher quality material that you can bend easily and then easily straighten out. Much more satisfying."
2,read before you buy,"If you are buying the AAXA P4 P4X Pico Projector, 95 Lumens, Pocket Size, Li-Ion Battery, HDMI, Media Player, 15,000 Hour LED, DLP Projector, don't buy this tripod. There is already one included with the projector. I also found this type of tripod to be EXTREMELY unstable. I would rather put this expensive projector on a pillow or beanbag to be safer."
3,Good for what it is.,"Legs are ""bendy"" which makes leg use more flexible. Short height makes you adjust legs more than normal to accomodate weight imbalance of camera. If camera tripod hole was in center of camera, would be no problem. But short height makes camera not as stable. Would recommend a longer tripod."
5,Great for my usage,"I purchased this tripod to use with a Creative Labs Pocket Camcorder. The camera is very light, so this stand works perfectly!! It may not be for you if you have a heavy camera, but great for my camcorder."
3,Solid and small,"This is a cute little thing. Very easy to stash in your bag and take anywhere. It is hard to set up vertical shots, but at this price, getting anything useful is a bonus, and the mini-tripod has helped me out."
2,one of the legs broke,worked for a while but one of the legs broke out and I superglued it and it is fine again.
4,good for bugsinsec,This will be good for my photos of insects......but dang !dudes.....this tripod smells like huaraches....probably made from recyled tires which is okay by me.......hope that it airs out soon so my friends dont think i have massive stinky sneakeritis!!!!!
3,gets the job done cheaply and barely,"This is a nice and portable gadget to have for small digital cameras. Sometimes its difficult to get the right angle depending on the surface. After bending the legs a bit in setting up the tripod, one of the legs fell out. I can jam it back in place but now it regularly falls out.Bottom line: Low cost and portability make up for flimsiness and less-than-perfect function."
3,Just For hold stand still,"its a simple product for every single camera out there, easy to use and also very usefull. if you looking to buy just something than can hold your camera stand still and let you regulate the lavel, this product is for you."
3,Tripod,Product is ok. In my case the company did not send it on time agreed.I sent it back and I was refounded.
5,Just what I expected,Nothing more I can say other than I ordered just what I would have purchased in the stores and was not dissappointed.
5,Good book but pretty basic,This is an excellent book. It is a good basic starting point. Well worth the price I paid and as always good job by Amazon.
5,Very complete resource,"As a lay-minister doing interim work at our church, I found this book an indispensible aid. Very well researched and layed out."
4,Anlgo-Saxon Chronicle,Interesting book with details about the English medievale history hardly possible to find in bookshops in Italy.
5,Classic,"Just a great collection for any Tenacious D fan to own. The songs and episodes bring me back. What's more to say? It's The D, baby."
4,"If you are a fan, this is just what you've been waiting for.","This is a great DVD. I've been waiting for the HBO episodes for longer than I can remember and now I have them in great quality.The concert is very good. I have some problems with the editing, but it's not too distracting.The extras are awesome. The short movies, the behind the scenes video, and the misic videos with the making of's, are all very welcome.The one thing I wish was there that isn't is commentary of the episodes, but, really, I can get over that.If you like The D, don't think twice about it. Buy this. You need it."
2,very short and sweet,"This book covers ALL cats in general, it's not specific enough for Persians.Dissappointing."
5,A great book on Persian cats to start with.,"This book is a good book for its size that does covers the basics that you need to know.Shows many variations of the Persians.For me personally finding a book that shows the blue eyed Chinchilla was a bonus.Plenty of colour photos throughout.If you are thinking of buying a Persian Cat this book will be a good start.Plenty of information here.For its size the book has a lot going for it.The photos are a treat,You're gonna love the photos in this book! This book has a lot to offer and is good value.Overall,a good quality book.I would suggest that this book be your first book on Persians then consider books on how to look after your kitten(s) and even the Cat encyclopedia type books after."
3,ClamPod,"I found the flexible army to be slightly more flexible than I would prefer (using a relatively light pocket camcorder). In the end it worked though. The clamp is very, very strong. Users should experiment with removing the black clamp pads for the best grip on the mounting surface."
2,too stiff,This is a great idea. It works--sort of. The problem is the gooseneck is so stiff and difficult to maneuver.
2,can not hold my flash unit,"The one with flexible rod is worthless, it doesnt hold my Sony HVL58 flash unit. The other part is ok though."
3,in a pinch,"""Not the best build, by far, but cheap. The ballheads DO actually work, but you have to crank them down beyond what they are likely to take for too long. I use them for very small lights like Par16's and small LED fixtures. Works OK. Bonus is that you can put this in places other grips cant go and it's very quick to move around. But overall, not a great tool, but can work in a pinch. """
1,Can I give it ZERO stars?,"This book is an absolute waste of both your time and your money. It basically contains the PHP and MySql manuals available for free from their websites.There is virtually no actual content from the author to help you learn PHP or MySQL.If you are looking for a good book on PHP and MySql check out PHP and MySQL Web Development by Luke Welling, Laura Thomson"
2,An incomplete guide.,"Touring the California Wine Country is not a comprehensive guide, partly due to the fact that it tries to cover too vast an area. It does provide good listings of Wineries in all eleven wine regions, along with places to dine there. However, the author did not include lodgings for the areas. Maps are provided, but they are not particularly detailed, and the overall format of the book is not innovative or extraordinarily user friendly. I would not suggest purchasing this book unless you purchase it in conjunction with at least two other guide books. There are quite a few good ones out there that are easier to reference quickly, but still provide history, logistics, and inspiration for touring wine country."
4,Motorcycle travels.,"I have personally ridden several of the rides in this book, and have not been dissapointed. I have enjoyed bike riding in New England most of my life, but still find new adventures in these books. I hope to finish all the rides in this book sometime this year. Then is will be on to another author. And the adventure continues!"
3,"Good period piece. Not great, but good.","Love triangle set in 1840s, with Goddard the center of affection for two men. The screenplay (which is thinly plotted and all-too-familiar) focuses too much on this particular aspect, not leaving room for some good intentions which could have made this one great. But it's directed with strong style and as usual, all three actors are at their peak, making their roles believable. Excellent special effects which won a well deserved Oscar."
2,Dried Out and Pale,"When I received this I was excited. However, most of the small containers of colors were completely dry. I know that you can regydrate them, but come on! When I used some of the colors with frosting I was making, it took quite a lot of the color to add any depth. I thought the point of using this type of coloring over the store-bought drops was the intensity of color. I think it is a bust."
3,Colores,"Estas pinturas son muy bonitas sin embargo la caja y los recipientes son muy pequeños la imagen aparenta que el producto es mas grande sin enbargo cada potecito tienen apenas unos 2,5 cm de altura."
2,"FYI, these are gels, not powders.","I know this may seem silly, but I thought I was buying powder/dry icing colors. These are gels, and as such, contain all kinds of junk in addition to the coloring, including high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, glycerine, and sugar. Gels are preferable to liquid color because they don't dilute your icing or cause it to crack as badly, but powder/dry colors don't contain other ingredients so they don't spoil and aren't as bad for you!"
5,Good stuff.,Right tool for the right job. Multiple sizes are a necessity. These were replacements; I had lent these out over a period and they never found their way home.
3,just okay,"A little flimsy, but all in all okay. If you don't use offset spatulas much, this would work for you."
5,I felt high just reading this,"As I took in the first drags of the smoothly written first chapter, I told those around me that I felt nothing. Anticipating the change that I knew was to come, I was surprised by the emotional volatility that followed. I literally cried and laughed out loud (while on an airplane) reading stories that floated off the pages. His humorous yet touching anecdotes circled my head, filled my chest, and left me with a hunger for more. This is pure stuff."
1,Great Magazine but.........,Why pay $34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for $19.98
2,Incompatible with Canon charger?,"I bought this battery as spare for my Canon Digital Rebel. However, the charger that came with the camera (CB-5L) would not charge it (no blinking lights). Not sure if the battery was defective or just incompatible. If you only need one extra battery as I did, I would recommend just paying the extra $$ and getting the Canon battery."
5,this is a great book,"david mcphail is one of my favorite children's authors. he had given me my own autographed copy of his story, LOST. it was given in 1990 and i still have it and read it every night. Yes i do remeber growing up knowing Pepe and Kiko. i do not know if he is still married to Jan, but growing up with david was a great memory of mine.Portsmouth, new hampshire lori ready"
4,A Double Leap For Sam,"Pay no heed to the one star review, this book is a great Leap. It isn't one of the best, I'll give you that, but it did split Sam Becket's psyche in two. In this novel and this one alone, we get two different versions of Sam at once: the one who wants to focus only on the Leap and how to solve it, and the one who is tired of Leaping and wants to settle down. What results is a sometimes comical, sometimes dramatic, altogether unique approach to the Leap themes. The two Sams move along different paths that will eventually cross in an explosive and touching finale. The only thing keeping it from a five star is the fact that it didn't reach as deep down as some of the other Leap novels and many of the episodes. Fans of the show know what I'm talking about, that little bit of seasoning that leaves you misty eyed. I can't quite describe it, but if you've ever read ""Angels Unaware"" you'll know. Overall, this one is worth reading."
2,good idea -- terrible execution,"The author needs a better editor to cull down this pointlessly long novel. It is a shame because the essential ideas are great. You get answers to the questions like the origin of the flying monkeys, and why the witch has a green face. But the imaginative bits are swallowed whole by the uninspired dialogue and the uber-pretentious ""theme"" of evil. Apparently unloved people are seen by others as evil, but they are not really evil. hogwash. Read something else!"
1,Didn't like it at all -,"I'll keep this short since everything's been covered. I'm a 31 yr old woman, and an avid reader of many genres and I couldn't stand this book. It was nothing like I'd expected. I could tell that from the start of it, but I really liked the idea behind the book and wanted to like the book. It was just awful... depressing, predictable, humorless, monotone, and lacked imagination. It dragged on for most of the story, and it was really hard to pick out what was important to the story because so much of it was just basically meaningless chatter. The story didn't flow well. The book only did so well because of it's association w/ Oz, but don't read it for that reason because it's nothing like the books or the movie, and it wouldn't even stand well on it's own."
4,Wicked Good,I really enjoyed the book and it the different perspective it offered. I saw the play after reading the book and was a little disappointed in the play because it was not true to the book.
1,"Sorry, just plain rude.","My daughter has fallen in love with the music from the play, and I bought the book to prepare for the theater experience, expecting something my daughter and I could enjoy together. She abandoned it very quickly, then I started reading - and couldn't make it past the first chapter. The whole tone is tawdry and disappointing. If Gregor Maguire has anything to say, his language and style ruined his chance at communicating this to me. I am sorry he got some of my money."
3,A Different Side of Another Coin....But Confussing,"Well, I just finished this book, and I liked it, but not as much as I liked ""Confessions"".For one thing, I found it hard to keep track of what was exactly going on in this book. The fact that Gregory Mcguire didn't keep constant with the name; switching between ""Elphaba"", ""Elphie"" and ultimately ""the Witch"", it was hard to follow; then there was the switching between the characters within a single paragraph here and there. It made this book difficult to read.Another reason why I didn't really like it is probably because I have spent the better part of my life (rather successfully too) avoiding ""The Wizard of Oz"". Now, this isn't ""The Wizard of Oz"", but it's almost close enough, though I still an saying I have avaoid ""The Wizard of Oz"" well for the 23 years of my life.Again, it's the ""villian's"" story, which I liked, but it could have been better written I think."
1,VILE SWILL - Save Your Money!,"After the prologue the author starts in on his fairy tale of how the wicked witch of the west was born. He manages to incorporate some of the most wicked, depraved, evil images I've come across in a long time of reading. If you're into books about the inner emotions of serial killers, devil worshippers, or child molesters, this is the fairy tale for you!"
3,Drags on but entertaining at times,I found this book to drag on and get off topic lots.The begging is really interasting and gets the reader sucked into the imagination of the book but then it drags on in the middle.At the end of the book it gets interasting again. The story is really smart and original. It shows how the wicked witch of the west turned so mean and green.
5,Great reading of a GREAT BOOK !,"It's fantastic to find such a wonderful reading of this interesting and innovative book available on cassette. It's so often that books are 'squashed up' for cassette format and, consequently, don't seem to have the same rhythm and flow as the original stories. This is an unabridged version, the full, complete fantastic story ! This cassette edition is great, the voices are well done and it does justice to Gregory Maguire's wonderful tale of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch. One of my very favourite novels has now become one of my favourite audio books. I highly recommend it !"
4,NEW TWIST ON A CLASSIC TALE,"I only bought this book because it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion, and I was kinda curious since I'd heard so much about the musical. I have to say I was really plesantly surprised! It was slow going at first, and the book is very long and detailed. I typically read a lot of easy fluff, so it took me a while to get through it, but in the end I loved it. I loved how we get to see a different perspective than the original story. This book really made me feel for the so called ""Wicked Witch"" I absolutely loved Elphaba's character and following her through her life was a delightful journey. The way they go back and explain things from the original story is very unique and fun. Pick up a copy if you haven't already, you won't be dissappointed. It will make you flash back to your childhood stories with new perspective."
5,Great book for a great price!,"I just got a Kindle for Christmas and was about to buy Wicked when I saw this version with bonus content and for a cheaper price. I thought there must be something missing, but the entire book is there as well as excerpts from the next three books. I was so glad I found this and have already recommended it to a friend while the limited price lasts.If you are a fan, or wanting to read for the first time, this is definitely a great deal!"
4,Not for kids,"So far, the writing is fairly good and it is easy to get into. However, I bought a copy for my 12 year old neice as a birthday present and it is not appropriate for her at all. Don't buy this for your kids!"
4,I liked it,"I definately enjoyed reading this book, though it was slow to start. There were also some times throughout the book where it kind of dragged, but at other times, I couldn't put the book down. I liked looking at the story of The Wizard of OZ from a different perspective. I have passed this book on to friends and family, and plan on reading Son of a Witch soon. This was my first Gregory Maguire book, and I plan on reading some of his other books with a twist too.I strongly recommend this book to anyone want to know the ""real"" story behind the story."
1,The worst book I have ever read!,"I threw the book in the trash when I was done with it. I saw the musical and wanted to know more behind the scenes. Believe me, the story of the musical was soooooooooo much better than this difficult to follow piece of dung. There were mysteries setup that were never resolved. You are left still wondering. It does people a disservice to put the musical's poster on the cover because the 2 stories could not be more apart."
3,good book for a trashie romance novel,the book had pontenial as a concept but ir reads like a trashie romance novelif thats what you like then by all means read this book but be prepaired
2,Don't buy unabridged 17 cds too long should be shortened,"I'm only giving 2 stars because it waffles on way too long.I would give it a 4 and 1/2 star if abridged.The story line is brilliant and as a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz (seen video so many times because raising children) I don't mind the idea of Oz being filled with danger and evil characters. Hearing of Elphaba's birth, school years through to her becoming a witch was very interesting.I would give it a 4 and 1/2 star if abridged.The strange sexual themes could be removed. Story could easily be 5 cds long or even 8, more than that is just rampling. But what a brilliant concept just raved on too long. (Narrator excellent)"
1,wickedly awful,I tried several times to finish reading this book. It is simply awful. The characters don't make sense and the prose is just boring! A grave disapointment.
3,"An interesting idea for a book, but too drawn out","I hadn't heard of the play that was inspired by this book when I picked it up recently. While I would still like to see the play after reading this book, I was disappointed in what I read. At first, I was very drawn to the detail of Elphaba's life, but about half way through the book the detail started to detract from the story line. I like the references to the ""Wizard of Oz"" movie (not having read the book) and enjoyed the change in perspective, but the politics got to be too much after a while."
2,Wicked is not Wicked,A overly descriptive story. The play was so much better! I love the play and to go from seeing that to reading the book was a disappointment. Just because you like the play doesn't mean you'll like the book. I read the entire thing waiting for it to get better and it never did.
2,I have never been so happy to finish a book!,"I was very excited about the idea of a story from the witch's point of view. I liked the very beginning of the story up until the time she went to school. Then it was all down hill from there! It became a job for me to even finish this book. All the extra stuff thrown in there was what I didn't care for. The story it self, the story of Elphaba and how she suffered through her life. The dealing with her family was really interesting. But all the Animal VS animal stuff really what was that all for? Leave all that and the sex stuff out and you have a great story. I liked the ending of the book and was so very pleased that it was over and I never have to read it again. I wouldn't even think of starting the second book. I would not suggest this book to anyone."
5,A Pure Delight!,"Initially I only read this because of the musical Wicked. I had fallen instantly in love with that and wanted a background into the character of Elphaba. I didn't expect to stay up all night reading this wonderful book. You will instantly be drawn into the story. It truly does shed a new light into the life and times of the Wicked Witch and by the end of the story you see things from a whole knew light. This is one story you will want to read again. If you are a fan of the musical you will want to read this because it does differ in many, many ways.Gregory Maguire is an extraordinary author who ties in modern day morals with a timeless story we all grew up hearing. This is a truly, truly delightful story that everyone should read at least once!"
4,very imaginative,"I purchased this book for both myself and my sister to read over our christmas break and by the end of our vacation we were racing to see who would finish and find out what happens in the end. Maguire does an excellent job of creating ""the untold story"" on the classic Wizard of Oz. I must admit though after reading this I purchased his other books and sadly this was the only book I can say that I enjoyed."
1,HELP!,"I saw this book at the store and went home and read the reviews in Amazon. I was so excited to get this book - I couldn't wait. Now I have it and I don't know what to do with it. I am on page 143. I am an educated person and read tons of books but this one seems ""over-my-head"". Is it just me????? Maybe I'm not focusing. The reviews make me want to stick with it - should I??????"
1,Just plain AWFUL,"I don't usually review books but this one was just horrendous. I felt it was worth reviewing simply because so many people see the show and assume the book will be just as great (and the show IS great!)Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth here. I suffered through this mess all the way to the end hoping it would (or even COULD) somehow be remedied. I've never read anything so anti-climatic in my LIFE. Nor have I ever had so much REGRET in finishing a book. I seriously cannot even believe there is anyone on the face of the planet who enjoyed this. The worst part is, I own two other books written by this author (that's what you get when you buy the sequels and accompaniments based on hype and not your own reading experience) - so lesson learned for me I guess!Bottom line - SKIP IT. This book is TORTURE. You can find quality kindling for much cheaper ..."
2,Overly descriptive,"Gregory Maguire is probably one of the most detail oriented author's today. There were parts of this book that I could really visualize in my mind as if I were there. Other parts I felt like screaming ""Get to the point already!"" I've even nodded off a few times and had to re-read the same sentence a few times. I started this book in Oct. of 2007 on a vacation. I put it down and just picked it up again because I'm determined to finish the darn thing! Wish I hadn't bothered to purchase it in the first place."
4,very good read,"This was my first book that I purchased on my kindle. This was for sure a great first choice. I can't wait to read ""Son of a Witch"", the sequel to ""Wicked""."
3,We are not in Kansas anymore...,"Reading this book satisfied my curiosity about the ""other"" characters in fairy tales. I always wondered what happened to make them, especially the mean ones they way they are. This book tells the tale of Elphie, the Wicked Witch. It also tells the story of her sister, the Witch of the East, who meets her doom as we all know, under Dorothy's house. I thought this was a great story, but it was not an easy tale to read. I would recommed reasing the real stories of Oz by L. Frank Baum, as many of the characters and places in ""Wicked"" come from those stories, rather than the famous musical. This story is much darker than the technicolor tale we all know so well, so poceed with caution if you are looking for a happy ending."
2,Addictive Story,"I thought the writing was very hard to follow, the conversations among the characters was unrealistic, and the stereotypes shown were too...stereotypical. But when I put the book down, thinking that it wasn't worth my while, I couldn't stop wondering what would happen to Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. So the story is great, but it couldn't have been written in a worse way."
2,not a comfortable read,"I really like the idea of this book - but i found it a really uncomfortable read - perhaps it was the prose but i just couldn't get in to it. The good stuff gets diluted by endless triviality, so despite trying attempts to stick with it, I kept reading a few pages at a time, rather than being sucked in by a page turner.ho hum."
1,Dull and Preachy,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. The story appeared to be intriguing and I will give the author points for originality but the execution was dreadful. It was a preachy, dull trip down the yellow brick road to no where. I continued reading just hoping it would get better and live up to the hype but ultimately it did not.. in short DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"This was very boring--not what I was expecting at all. I thought it would have more fantasy and whimsy. What it does have are very long passages discussing politics, philosophy, and ruminations about good vs evil. It was a challenge to get through. I know I am in the minority here from reading the other reviews. But I think an alternative opinion is good."
3,Not as Wicked as One Would Think,"Although the plot, and story its self seem great, it is an ""okay"" book. Not a favorite, but I dont' hate it. If you're bored, an like Oz, read it. If you're not into magic or politics, don't read."
1,Very dissappointed. Don't buy the book.,"Based on several reviews and the reviews of the musical I bought this book for my teenaged daughter. I browsed the book to whet my own appetite for the fun this book promised, but was soon horrified by the content. The book is filled with vulgarity, and very crude sexual content throughout. It doesn't even qualify as a good book for adults and I'm disappointed that it's being marketed to kids. I'd give it a negative star if I could."
3,Great premise...loses steam,"Like many other reviewers here, I churned through the first 200 pages of ""Wicked"" only to find that the second half of the story petered out. I liked Elphaba. I didn't expect this to be written in Baum style or be like the film, so that's not my beef with this book. The problem is I was expecting a revelation, a deeper understanding, a solid sense of what the Witch was all about--her motivations--really taking to the idea that she was not just ""Wicked"" for the sake of being so. But, though Mr. Maguire offers many theories and possibilities--building up during the first half of the book--he never closes the deal. Instead he rambles on in the middle of the book introducing characters that you think might, possibly, have an impact on the story only to then dismiss them without further thought. It's an interesting idea that unfortunately didn't come to fruition."
3,Which Witch?,"OK, as a steriotypical Gay man I know lots of the movie by heart (and once played the Cowardly Lion in community theater). As a life long bibliophile I read the Oz books over and over again back in the days before VCR's when you had to wait a WHOLE YEAR to see the movie again but could read the book at any time.Anyone who has read the book and seen the movie knows they are different, seperate realities._Wicked_ draws mostly from the books, but there are elements from the movie that don't belong in the books. A third alternate reality of the story, and the seams show. If you were not familiar with either the movie or the book, or prehaps not compulsive about contiunity or versimilitude, you might enjoy this one. If you know the other versions, you will be confused."
1,Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,"Hate the book, just can't get into it. I read a lot and I wouldnot recommend this book, just doesn't hold my interest. Waste of time."
3,Parents Be Warned,"For those of you who have children who enjoyed watching ""The Wizard of Oz"", and think your child might enjoy reading the prequel to it, DON'T! This book is NOT FOR CHILDREN!There is nothing on the cover, or in the reviews included inside the front cover, to warn you about this. And if you don't know better, you would think a book that has a Broadway play based on it... a play you would feel comfortable taking your children to see... would be safe for your children to read.This book, though it may contain a rich and full fantasy story about the Wicked Witch of the West, it also contains bad language and sex scenes that are so explicit that it can make an adult feel uncomfortable reading them.So if you feel as I do, don't buy this book for your child to read... and if your child already has it in their collection, and haven't read it yet, I would suggest removing it before they do."
2,Wickedly disappointed ...,"I had read so many positive reviews of this book, however, after my own reading of it I was VERY disappointed. When I began, I was under the impression of such a wonderful story that had so much potential but as I progressed I was engrossed in garbled language that made the the plot difficult to understand. Not only the creation of a unfamiliar language but the multiple twisted sexual exploits of numerous creatures lost my interest almost immediately.Considering that this story was derived from childrens' fairytale, evil or otherwise, at what point would these characters actually be exposed to and use curse words from the writer's own native tongue, why weren't those words made up?"
1,All that was clever about the play...is not in the book.,"All that was clever about the play...is not in the book. I wish it was possible to give 0 stars. I so loved the show, and was eager to read the book it was based upon. So disappointing. All the clever elements of the play, which have one questioning the concepts of good and evil, of preconceived notions and prejudices -- not in the book.Please save your money. Truly a waste. Kudos to whoever wrote the play's script, they are the real genius. Gregory Mcguire should send them all the proceeds from this book from everyone who was 'tricked' into buying it."
5,Bravo!!,"Wicked combines a plethora of genres: it is adult fairy tale, soap opera, family saga, political satire, and revisionist novel expertly meshed together with a page-turning plot and decent character development. A little sex, a little biting wit...this is light fiction that any avid reader would find delighting. Wicked is Harry Potter for grown-ups--i'm addicted--and i'm getting the sequel tomorrow!!"
3,If you're a fan of the original Oz . . .,"THEN DO NOT READ THIS BOOK ! ! ! !I fell in love with Oz , and I was excited to fall im love all over again , though sadly that wasn't the case .This book brings such a new view of the land of Oz that I at first did not recognize it ! The characters such as Guhlinda ( Glinda for those who have not read it yet :) and Elphaba ( the Wicked Witch of the West ) did not have ANY connection to their descriptions in the Wonderful Wizard of Oz .To me , if this was it's own novel it would've been phenomenal in the *echem* MATURE readers section , but the fact that it was a [ sort of ] sequl\prequel to ANOTHER book just messed everything up ."
2,Never Delivers What You Are Waiting For...,"Not a great book, just a descent read. It never quite delivers what you are hoping it will deliver. Skips around a lot in the plot and with the scenes. Gives sketchy character introductions and weak development. What a shame. Reading it, it seems to have so much potential, but that potential is never realized. Ends leaving you wanting much more explanation and development."
3,Great Characterizations. Bad plat.,"I have read this and the next two in his Wicked series. I really enjoyed the characters and was engrossed in the world crafted by Gregory Maguire. However, he has a serious fetish with people who can't do anything and the idea that EVERYONE who isn't a good person is a hypocritical sinner (Except, strangely, Dorthey). Elphaba only succeed in one thing in her life. She didn't commit a massacre in the name of the cause. The same can be said of her son and the Lion (oh well, I guess Elphaba also saved the Cowardly Lion). I will finish reading what he has wrote because I really do enjoy his writing. And I am sure I will have the same thing to say about them all. So take it for what it's worth."
4,interesting,"When I first started reading Lost, I was rather confused. The writing was hard for me to follow, but I stuck with it. The more I read, the more intrigued I became. As I neared the end, everything came together, but not as I expected."
2,"loved the idea, hated the execution","I really like the authors' premise of diving into the back story of OZ. However for me it just never seemed to come together. I often had the impression that the author had a momentary flash of inspiration that as he continued to develop just ran out of steam and eventually trailed off into pointlessness. In my mind this is especially evident in the last few pages when the author simply tries to wrap things up by simply writing charecters and events off as a complete mystery. As I say in the title... loved the idea, hated the execution."
2,Awkward interface with original,"Maguire's lack of success in fitting his story, with the original Wizard of Oz story, condem this book to mediocrity. Its a strong compelling story until the moment Dorothy arrives. The pace changes, the narrative gets crisper, and the story carry forward to the witch's death with far less of the depth and texture than was in the previous pages. I would have much preferred if Maguire had not tried to be so true to the original story and resolved the witches life on his own. The scene where Dorothy kills the witch is just very inadequate - reads almost like a newspaper report. So I, like several others who reviewed here, was disappointed. I suggest either reading to where Dorothy arrives and stop, or begin when she arrives. In either case you will probably enjoy Mr. Maguire's book. Just don't read both."
4,good read,"Good read, but contained too many PETA references. Who would have known the Wicked Witch of the West was an animal rights anarchist?"
2,Wicked,"spine was torn and worn, multiple pages folded back and torn. didn't think it was as good as advertised."
2,Ending not worth the time getting there.,"For a book that was hyped as being so good, I was really disappointed. The book was well written, but after reading many pages, the book ended with a thud."
5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book,"Dark, adventurous, and entertaining. This is an easy read that goes by very fast."
1,Love it or hate it??,"I know that some people really enjoyed the book, but I was not a fan. I can honestly say that I never hated a book until I read this one. It was incredibly slow, had a lot of GRAPHIC and equally DISTURBING content, and there was no resolution. I agree with an earlier review that I felt absolutely no connection to the characters, and didn't care what happened to them. I didn't know if I was supposed to feel sorry for Elphaba, or if he meant for me to hate her, but at the end, I just hated everyone in the book. No endearing qualities for anyone in Oz, apparently."
1,Overly Dirty,"After seeing the amazing stage production of the same name, we bought this book and were excited to read more about it. We were shocked by the opening chapters to be reading such filth! Why were such dirty details necessary--the musical didn't need them in order to be successful! We kept reading for a bit to see if it cleaned up to get on with the story, but unfortunately it did not. It was sad to have to put it away, unfinished."
3,The Shiz,Not what I was expecting. I read the whole book and didn't really like the story too much. I guess I just wanted more from the characters.
3,Almost coulda used more sex...,"Maguire's OZ is colorful, complex, spooky and sad. Great for those who like to root for the underdog or see the prom queen slip coming off the parade float. However, I agree with some of the comments that the flow of the book sometimes stalled and then jerked back to life without warning. Second, the number of non-essential characters in this book was somewhat overwhelming. Finally, I have to respectfully disagree with the idea that this book comes off as over-sexed. If anything, I found that the sex/romance aspects of this book were almost cursory."
1,this book needed years more of work,"Having just finished Wicked, I find consolation in the 1-star reviews. The author, with all his noble intentions, fails - like the poor Elphaba -in all of them. So much promise, and such an annoying and depressing result."
3,It's about the point of view,"Don't judge that Witch too quick... after all we only saw Dorothy's side of it all. This is NOT an easy read though. I think the book didn't pick up for me until the middle and it took me a long time to get there. Once I did it became enlightening and helped to rethink before a judgment...what about those wicked sisters? hmmm. If you like looking for symbolism, hidden things involving politics...sort of like Shakespeare hides things...then read it. No..it's not written shakespearean...but, it does hide politics in there."
3,Very Complicated Read,"I was thrilled with the concept of this book. The idea behind the plot is intriguing, however the book is very long, and extremely complicated. There is too much going on and it does not flow easily. The writing style is difficult to comprehend. Often I was reminded of reading ""Jabberwocky"". The words sound nice but I have no idea what they mean. There are many parts of the story I enjoy but I am struggling to get through the entire book."
2,Choppy and incomplete,"After hearing all the excitement over the broadway musical, I thought I would read the book. I was very disappointed. I found there to be a LOT of sexual references that were not needed and detracted from the story! There was also occasional profanity that seemed to come from no where. Take out all the uncessary filler and the book would be about 1/3 the size, but then it would be the story of the wicked witch of the west. I think I would have been drawn more into her life if there weren't so many distractions."
1,Horrible execution of a terrific idea,"I chose this book for my book club without having read it first. Biggest mistake EVER! This book is a MESS. The author lacks any real focus. He needed an editor badly. The story needed to be stripped down to its essence and then written in a straight-forward way. I felt no closer to knowing what really made the Wicked Witch of the West who she was. Also, I have to agree with many others that the sexual content was not only completely unnecessary, but overly gratuitous and revolting. I purchased this book and rather than loan it out, or give it away, I am throwing it away (something I have NEVER done before)."
1,why I threw it away,"Because I could not get over such a casual use of such strong language and obscene situations, I only read to page 72 of 538. I bought the book because I fell in love with the Musical, but I found myself to be very disappointed each time I sat down to read."
2,dark dismal story,"I found this story to be dark and depressing. I did manage to finish the book (I kept expecting it to get better), but I was very disappointed. The book does raise plenty of questions about evil and its possible sources. but evil is evil: whether it is a learned behavior or a maladaptive coping mechanism, evil is still evil. the story is like explaining why Hitler turned out so badly. who cares?! evil is still evil."
1,A Good Premise... Nothing More!,"I can't believe the good reviews this book has pulled in. Inconsistent and poorely writen, I never once found my imagination roaming the enchanted world of OZ. It was as if the author thought he was being clever in showing the true events (behind the scenes). Even when the author recants the point which Dorothy acquires the ruby shoes, he does so without the Wicked Witch being pressent... that's not how I remember it. Come on Gregory, at least do your homework!"
1,"Garbled, tangled, meandering, not an enjoyable read","I kept reading and reading this book page by page, waiting and waiting for it to make some kind of sense and it never did. I got to the end and was more disappointed by any book I've been in a long time. The language and ideas were just too garbled most of the time and it was hard to keep track of it all. I won't read anything by this author again, just not my cup of tea. I feel like asking for my money back on this one."
5,What can you say about this book?,"Since it encompasses every important societal lesson as well as personal lessons about the laws of love and loss and averages. In Wicked Mr. Maguire wrote a one of a kind novel, people will be reading this a hundred years from now and like me they will sigh with pleasure and wince in pain. Its a magic book it brings OZ to life it creates Elphaba and if you cant love Elphaba well whats wrong with you? More though its every horror story that ever really happened, racism and exclusion and invasion and somehow despite the Sophies Choice moments in this best ever book Mr. Maguire makes you laugh and he enchants you and more than this I cant say, he's a gifted, gifted writer and he has created a timeless story for anyone lucky and smart enough to read it."
3,Long and too drug out.,The story has to many parts that are just boring and it gets hard to follow. It does start to pick up again at the end. This could have been a lot shorter to be a better read. Overall i had to force myself to not get any new books so i would not get sidetracked by more exciting reads.
3,A good airplane read.,"I found ""Wicked"" an enjoyable book to read: an interesting spin on an old story while making a point that is not all that deep (but nonetheless worthwhile). ""Wicked"" provides an attractive alternative to watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" while listening to ""Dark Side of the Moon."""
2,More political propaganda than character development,"This book could have been so good, but it isn't. If it really would have told the ""true"" story of the Wicked Witch of the West, it would have been a wonderful story, but it focuses way more on the political atmosphere of Oz, in a preachy way, than on the life of Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West)."
2,Wicked is Wasted,"This author has a great imagination, but he fails to follow through on his ideas and this greatly weakened the characters and plot. There are some very exciting parts, but then it rambles on . I am surprised that the publisher went ahead with this book as is. There was great potential that was missed."
1,Buyer beware,"This book was disqusting, it was nothing like i thought it would be. In the first chapter there was graphic sex and as i flipped through the rest of the book it continued on. I would not have bought this book if I had known the nature of it. The reviews from previous readers said what a great book it was but anyone with any sort of a moral compass should avoid this book! I actually threw this book away after reading the first chapter!"
2,Wicked Book!,I do not think this book is suitable for people. It has much sexual content and should not be on the shelves for children!!!!!
2,Liked the concept of the book,"I liked the concept of the book, and I did find a lot of the ideas to be interesting. But frankly, I got lost in all the religious jargon. I could have lived without half of it. There was more description and detail in the 4 (were there only 4?) religions than the rest of the story. There were so many things that could have been expanded on but he spent soooo much time on the religions. I was so glad to finally be finished with the book. I just wanted it over. I can't even say now if I enjoyed it or not. It was ok, but it could have been a lot better."
1,Waste of Time,"I love to read a wide variety of books, and I loved the Wizard of Oz. I was told this book was great, and I was so anxious to get my hands on it and start reading. What a disapointment! This book was boring and moved too slowly. I tried to force myself to finish reading it, but just couldn't. What a waste of money."
1,Deserves a No Star Rating,"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever tried to finish. I had it for months (on loan from a friend) and for months I dutifully tried to wade my way through it.In a nutshell it's boring, badly written and not one character is even remotely likable or sympathetic.I love buying books and I love going to the library as well but I'm here to tell you:Don't waste your time or money! Bleech!"
2,"NOT the play, hard to get through","I've heard such great things about the play, that I purchased the book and a few other titles by this author. I've been trying to read this book for a few months now but it is very difficult for me to get into. I am truly surprised by all of the positive reviews. I made it to about the middle and I think I've finally given up and accepted that I wasted my money. If you have a chance to flip through the book in the bookstore before buying, I'd highly recommend that. Maybe it's for you, but if you are like me, you'll realize that the way this author writes is not very appealing. Wish I hadn't wasted the money."
2,An unmagical book,"I've spent a week trying to plod through the first hundred pages! I loved the Oz books and was really looking forward to reading ""Wicked."" It's very contrived and I'm having a very hard time staying with it. Let's face it....I'm bored. Caveat emptor!"
1,"Boring, not at all like the musical","I had heard from a friend that the musical Wicked was amazing, so I bought tickets for the show right away. As I was waiting for show day to arrive I decided to read the book to get a better idea of what the musical was about.I started reading the book believing it would be amazing, but as I got through the first chapter I started doubting whether I could finish it. The book is immensly boring. I'm not going to lie, the book almost put me to sleep a coulple of times. The dialouge is overly formal and nothing like the fun movie ""The Wizard of Oz"" that I had grown to love. I had to force myself to finish the book, which was a feat in itself.Now I started dreading going to the musical which I was sure to be extremely boring. But the musical is the very opposite, the music is amazing especially ""Defying Gravity"" which is one of the best scenes I have ever seen on broadway.My advice is to skip the book and go straight to the musical, you wont be disappointed."
1,"Read me a bedtime story, Mommy.","First, I find it very refreshing to see such a broad range of reviews for a particular book or movie. Usually everyone loves it or hates it.There is only one reason to read Gregory Maguire's novel, ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"", and that is to see how they were able to make a Masterpiece as The Broadway Musical ""Wicked"" from one of the most boring books this reviewer has every read. I was fortunate to witness the London Showing of ""Wicked"".About the book: Oh, all your favorite characters and places are there, Elphaba, Nessarose, Galinda/Glinda, Fiyero, Boq, Madame Morrible, Doctor Dillamond. The Wizard, Shiz University and the Emerald City. But they weren't quite the same. This is definitely not a children's book. Full of four letter words and sex was widely enjoyed, especially by Elphaba. The characters were all forgettable and story too long and I repeat, boring.5 stars for the musical.1 Star for the book."
4,Thought-provoking and entertaining read!,"If you enjoyed the story of the Wizard of Oz, this is an excellent companion piece. In the original, you saw Oz through the eyes of a stranger, Dorthy Gale. In Wicked, you see it through the eyes of the ""Wicked"" Witch of the West. But more interesting, you get to know the side characters much more intimately: the Wizard, Glinda, the ""Wicked"" Witch of the East. You come to understand the Witch of the West's (aka Elphaba) motivations, and how misunderstandings, grudges, timing, misconceptions play an important in the ""creation"" of a person's identity and ultimately their life; thereby asking the question, ""what is evil really?""I also felt that Maguire captured the tone and language that Baum had set in the original story.P.S. Understanding where the winged monkeys come from now, they definitely seem less scary!"
3,"Interesting concept, I had to read it","I thought the title was catchy, that's what got me to read it. I thought the book was good. Some parts were slow, some parts were a little gross, but all in all I liked the idea of seeing the Wicked Witch of the West point of view. Interesting."
1,"What a cruel, cruel world. . . .","The books of Maguire were touted as ""reimagining of classic fairy tales."" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."
3,3.5 STARS!!!!,"The first 150 pages or so were difficult to get through, but then the plot and characters become more interesting. I didn't want to put the book down towards the end. Very imaginative and colorful reading--your imagination is really the only limit of how well you enjoy this book."
4,Slow and Steady,It has taken me some time to get started but it is very interesting. It is more sexual then what I had thought it would be.
4,Wicked,"Wicked -Gregory MaGuireThe book Wicked is based on the witch's point of view. It takes place before she meet stand Dorothy. Before the whole melting fiasco. Not many people realize that wicked with had a name. She was named Elphaba after Aelephaba a water saint of the waterfall. Some people who know her pretty well like Boq just call her Elphie, but later on she will acquire and alias known as Fae. In the beginning of the book talks about Elphaba's childhood and how she was born. Her father is a priest and her mother was a beautiful maiden. Elphaba was born green and her grandmother says this may be a result of her mother fooling around with other men. The second part of the book starts with Galinda on her way to college. Once she arrives in a twist of fate she ends up rooming with Elphaba. In the beginning Galinda can't stand Elephaba but by the end the become pretty good friends. This is a good book to read if you're sick of the typical romance, or happy endings."
2,One Demensional,"This book was just blah. There was soo much potential to make this a truly outstanding story, and instead you walk away feeling you only got half the story. The characters were one demensional, the plot seemed slow, pedantic, and irritating like a sticker in your shoe. And what was with the sex scenes? I am by no means a prude, but they just seemed so heavy handed, and you could definitely tell a man wrote them. I wanted to know more about elphaba's inner dialogue (by the way I didn't like the name because I found it detracted from the story. my mind stuttered over it whenever it was on the page. they should have just stuck with fabala.) I expected this to be a really good book. Now I'm putting it on my shelf of disappointments, right beside the da vinci code."
4,Makes you re-think good and evil,"Wicked takes you on an imaginative exploration what you thought you knew about a classic story. With an interesting dive into obsession, heartbreak, failure, and expectations, Maguire allows you to draw a lot of your own conclusions when it comes to the Wicked Witch. I read this book with no expectations which was perfect. I had no idea what to expect and was enthralled with the brilliant evolution of the story line and the characters that we thought we had pegged in terms of character. Even Dorothy is left in a different light.The imagery of all of Oz and its surrounding regions are beautifully done and capture the imagination from page to page. If you think you know what the story is all about, think again. This will make you rethink several of your favorite characters from Baum's original masterpiece."
5,a masterpiece to be read,"this book is one of the greatest i've ever read. Elphaba is my herione in the book i don't even see her as the villian, her story is so trageic and involving, the character's are very real and come alive with the imagination of maguire, he weave's their stories together brilliantly. his discripitive outlook on good and evil that elphaba constantly struggles to understand is so deep and involving that you find yourself right next to her trying to figure it out yourself. this book is a must read for all oz fans and people who want a unique look at good and evil."
5,A must read,Whether you read the Frank Baum book or just saw the movie (and who hasn't) you must read this book. The author's clever and unique retelling of the tale leaves no stone unturned in examining the life behind the child who would become the Wicked Witch of the West. Full of surprises and brilliant insight into what makes us do what we do and begin to question what is right and what is wrong. Few books can capture the imagination so quickly as this. Do yourself a favor - read this book. Also check out his retelling of Cinderella - Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister.
4,great service,"I received the book quickly and it was in really good condition, would definitely purchase from this vendor again."
2,Not too great!,"My boyfriend suprised me with tickets to see Wicked on Broadway for my 18th birthday. I had the soundtrack forever, so I knew the synopsis of the story. But I decided to go out and get the book. But much to my suprise, it wasn't that great! There are MANY adult themes and often times I regretted bringing it to class for fear that I would gasp out loud! I am going to see the musical next weekend, and I really hope that its better than the book!"
2,Don't Read this Book - See the Broadway Show,"The idea of a counter history of the Wizard of Oz is a clever idea. However, the author's plot is often wrong footed and writing style meandering. I was very disappointed. It was a missed opportunity.This book has gotten a reputation for empowering girls. Yes, the witch marches to the sound of her own drummer, but she certainly is not empowered. She remains a minor cog in the revolt against the Wizard and rarely seems effective.If you want to see how the story is done right, see the Broadway show, which was wonderful. I only wish the author would take a tip from the plot development of the show and rewrite the orginal book."
2,Hype overblown,"This book has some cute bits in the beginning. As the book goes on it becomes long winded and meandering. I do not understand how it got any good reviews. Based on my reading of this book, I would not buy another book by Gregory Maguire."
3,Nice tripod,"Pros:- Quite steady- High quality material- Good lookingCons:- Has trouble holding heavier cameras (e.g. DSLR) at an angle- A little bit on the heavy side. If you are already holding a DLSR walking around a big city for the whole day, you will wish this tripod was ligther."
1,Bait and Switch,I have a Sunpak 2003 it is a great little tripod for a point and shoot camera. I ordered one for my work from Sonic Sense. When I opened the package I realized I did not get a Sunpak 2003 I received a piece of junk. So as far as I'm concerned I give the tripod 4 stars and for Sonic Sense 0 stars.
1,Firmware apparently (and desperately) needs an update,"This router worked for a few months, then started crashing every few minutes, losing its configuration every time. From the other reviews, it looks like this is a common problem that Netgear refuses to address."
1,Tear Mender,"I used this product on a torn pants pocket. It was messy to use and the it was hard to put the adhesive in the right places to repair the torn pocket. The end result was not satisfactory. The adhesive was not in the right position to close off the hole only so part of the untorn pocket got glued as well. Also, the glue did not hold after it dried. When I put my hand into the pocket and applied a little pressure the adhesive started to give. I was very unsatisfied with this product. Maybe it would work better with another type of tear."
3,"It was good good, for a year. got a Kenmore","I have this. It WAS good but it stared brning. I got it when we moved in to a now 10 year old home. I loved it! The bag filed out fast. But it did it from the start, it brned. From the frist day. We called Rayal, but they said it was comen with Drit Devils. Then about 8 moths later, it stoped. I wa vacuuming and the lite whent out and started to bran. Then I got an ORECK. I loved it! Then I got a Bisell, it was OK but I liked the Dirt Devil Better and the ORECK. Next, which I like best, a New [2004-2005]which is still out, a Kenmore Magic Blue. If this is the frist Drit Devil you get, it a good start to see how bad Drit Devil is. Also it is funny, but Royal vacuums I LIKE! And Dirt Devil is made buy Royal. I would get this if you have a small home, and dont like or dont vacuum as much as would. I LOVE to vacuum [and im 8 year old!]. But if have a bigger home and LIKE to vacuum, I would get the Kenmore Magic Blue."
3,I was disappointed,I like:- Case like a rubber- Great reception on short waveI do not like:- Knob for tuning is very sensitive and difficult to handle.- Very large antenna- Do not memorize the stations.- Button of power sometimes fails.- Reception of FM medium-quality.- Seletividade medium quality.- During radio listener does not show the clock
4,good,"Good radio. Picks up signals pretty good but the dial is very sensitive and their is no button to lock it so it stays off. But it picks up signals quite good. Please note they will send you a refurbished unit but you wouldn't know from the looks of it. Its just like new and at J&R this radio costs 40 bucks so overall, its a great deal."
3,"nice, but not what i expected","it's an ok portable radio. the sound quality is good for its size, and the AM/FM reception is clear if you're near a window. the problem is that even on top of a hill i managed to find only a handful of Short Wave stations (the religious ones...)."
3,You Decide,"Pros: Looks great, above average FM reception, good antenna, and good accessories included.Cons: Over-sensitive tuning wheel, have to keep turning unit over for some printed info (band and wheel labels), tuning one band changes the station on all bands, band slider feels imprecise, no scan feature.For the price....maybe."
4,Good Radio for Beginners,"I bought this radio over Amazon a few days ago and it works great. It has great FM reception and although the tuning isn't digital, it's okay."
4,grandson loves it,this is a good game my 5 year old grandson loves it.. He plays all the time with friends and by himself.. I recomend this game.
2,Hmmm?,I was hoping it would be more like sonic original stuff but its not. Maybe I just diddnt know what I was getting.
3,Amiable but lacking,"'Lucky Jim,' Kinglsey Amis's first and most highly regarded work, is perhaps my favorite book of the 20th century. Its wicked satire, couched as it is in beautiful prose and a tone of comic forgiveness of human frailty, makes me return to it again and again. The movie version misses much of the nuance of Amis's humor (Ian Charmichael's portrayal, for example, of congenitally perplexed Jim Dixon is far too glib), but is good fun and ought to be seen by any fan of the novel, or of post-WWII British film.Note: a more successful movie adaptation of a less successful K. Amis book, 'That Uncertain Feeling,' can be found with 1961's 'Only Two Can Play' starring Peter Sellers."
4,No fillers added...,"this is one of the few nutrition bars on the market free of fillers, cholesterol and fat - they're definitely worth a try. Excellent between meal snack. I have them auto-delivered monthly."
2,Weeeeellllllll...,"They're...okay. LOTS OF SUGARS, using a favorite manufacturing tactic of incorporating many different forms of sugar so that none of them will lead the ingredients list, in which ingredients are ranked by weight. If the bars were formulated with just one form of sugar, I'm reasonably sure it would be the first ingredient. They're somewhat chalky, and you need to have a lot of water to drink along with them. They will supply protein along with all that sugar, but by my standards they don't actually qualify as a 'nutrition' bar - the levels of vitamins and minerals are about nil. They're really just an energy bar with the bonus of being gluten-free, and for what they are, they're good enough.One more little piece of info: Scan the reviews. Then note that the president of PureFit is Robb Dorf. Look familiar?"
5,Purefit Bars are awesome!,"OK, I'm hooked on the Purefit Almond Crunch bar. There is nothing better with a cup of green tea before my morning run. These bars never melt and travel well. I keep a stash of bars in my car for after workouts and when my kids need a snack before sports. They like the Almond Crunch and the Peanut Butter too. A Purefit bar is better than any packaged kid snack you'll find in a grocery store."
3,Slight berry flavored aftertaste,"I really like the Almond Crunch bars by this company, but I ordered a box of their Chocolate Brownie bars and every one in that box that I have tried has a berry (maybe raspberry) aftertaste that I really dislike. I would not order them again."
5,Entertaining,I bought this to show my students after reading the play. It is a really entertaining movie. Great characters. The movie stays true to the play too.
3,Decent bathroom reader....,"...as these types of books go, but I finished it in about 15 minutes. The premise: get a bunch of aging ""music critics"" to write a couple of paragraphs about a relatively obscure/totally obscure ""lost classic,"" mainly in the bubblegum/power pop genre.Warning: the Beach Boys L.A. (LIGHT ALBUM) is considered (by one of the contributors) to be one of these ""lost classics."" Alrighty then....Bottom line: The book is OK if you have $14 bucks that you really don't need to spend on something else. If you're like me and don't have that kinda dough tearing a hole in your pocket, visit your local library."
5,Can't go wrong with McGard,"These lugnuts are absolutely bomb proof. I have an existing set on my pickup truck..its been about 5 years now since I first got them, and the chrome plating isn't flaking, there's no rust to be seen, and they hardly show any signs of discoloration or pitting. I've had auto-part store chrome lug nuts before, and after the first tire rotation or so, I noticed that the chrome plating almost always fall off. If you buy these, they will be the last set of lugnuts you ever need on your vehicle."
5,A delightful collection!,"These are evocative stories... most do not end with an event, and most do not have a wrap-it-all-up ending... but each story leaves you with a feeling, an emotional response. I highly recommend ""Karma and Other Stories."" Well written, and very engaging."
4,Very pretty,"It was just the perfect size, glad I ordered a med for my usually small chihuahua. He likes it! Perfect for the cold months coming to help keep him warm and our house pee pee free! You have to use a pad with a liner such as ""panty protectors"" kotex because there is no lining in the belly band."
5,An Awesome Psychology Reference Tool,"Ideal for professional psychologists and general readers alike. I discovered this book in the library and I was highly impressed with both the content and the presentation of the material. I have been involved with and interested in psychology for many years. With over 10,500 psychology-related entries, this new psychology dictionary is the most up-to-date reference of its kind available. It covers all areas of psychology including psychoanalysis, psychiatry, neuroanatomy and statistics. There is comprehensive coverage of phobias and phobic stimuli and mental disorders."
3,"Content fine, Quality of paper quality weak","The content of dictionary is fine. The quality of the binding is far less than desirable and paper is weak. Will not, in all likelihood, last a long time."
4,Relaxing,"Very nice to listen to at the end of the day. After a deep breath, blow it out.... a great way to de-stress. Very relaxing. HIGHLY recommend. Next...dolphins."
5,Interesting view of tradional religious thought,"I had the pleasure of being one of John Perry's students in school. An excellent teacher and an excellent man, his books have greatly helped me in my quest for the truth of the Bible, religion, and my relationship with the creator of the universe. This book looks at some of the inconsistensies in the more ""traditional"" views of the Bible and focuses on how the Bible should actually be used in our daily lives. A must read."
4,TRY THIS EXPERIMENT.......,I may have gotten a different measuring cup. It states on the back that 2 scoops is 48 gms. But I had to use 3 scoops to get 48 gms. I used a very precise food scale and even used my mothers to verify this. Try this for yourselves and let me know what you get.
2,Didnt really work for me....,"the taste is disgusting unless you put something else in it, but I gained about 5lbs from this product. im really skinny and i wanted to gain some fat but after a month of drinking this i gained the smallest amount of fat in my stomach.. so i guess its about how you use the shake with a workout or diet plan because i didnt do any of that."
1,Writing your own stories is better,"This book is too expensive for what it offers, and is definitely not recommended,write your own stories, since so many examples are available online.This book does not give an exhaustive examples and not that many pictures. You know your child better and a majority of social stories may not be appliacble to you.I was greatly disappointed with this book,"
5,Uplifting and Inspiring,"George BaileyProvo, UTFew books have inspired me more than this one (and I have read a LOT of books). I do not struggle with the challenge of same-gender attraction. However, I read this book in the midst of one of my own greatest personal trials only to find myself lifted up by the universal gospel principles taught herein. I would recommend this book to anybody who wishes to understand better the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The authors remain completely in harmony with the policies and doctrines outlined by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They effectively point out that we are all fallen and all in need of the same Savior. I will ever be grateful to the authors for having increased my understanding of Jesus Christ and his role in my own life."
5,excellent introduction,"This book gets right to the point and for the most part avoids religious arguments. Unlike many writers on info tech philosophies and tools, Fowler doesn't exaggerate the advantages of the topic or underrate alternatives -- he just gives you straight facts and honest evaluations. This introduction to UML tells you what you need to know to use UML, right away, without getting bogged down in trivial details or excessive obvious background material.Highly recommended."
4,System Analyst,I found this book very helpful. The book is to the point and in very formal language. You will not find long stories and very descriptive. I think its worth to keep it in your shelf.
3,Straightforward,"UML is not the most interesting subject to study. It's all about lines (associations) decisions, modeling etc. This book does nothing to alleviate the boredom factor, except a couple of examples are noteworthy for their strangeness.I found studying other books in conjuction with this class material helped me the most.'"
1,good for cocktail party conversations,"Larman, Booch and Fowler are the bestat writing well padded books.A computer science professor recentlystated my views in few well chosen words.He said: ""I read Grady Booch's first book three timesand asked myself what I had learned. I decided nothing!""I recommend the Wrox book by Muller, scientificand to the point"
1,This is the most boring book ever......,This has to be the WORST book I have ever had the HOROR of reading. Not only was it dreadfully BORING but it is also poorly constructed.The only reason I give UML Distilled 1 star is because ot put me to sleep each and EVERY night I read it for my Systems Alalysis and design course.SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,Very biased with his personal preferences,"This book presents some uml information, possibly useful. However, it is all tainted with his own way of doing things. In one case (talking about constraints on class diagrams) he actually says there is a uml way of doing it (OCL) but he doesn't use it. So instead of showing the UML way, he shows his own.I feel that was conssitent with the rest of the book.In order to learn UML, I am using more of other books, and less of UML Distilled with every day that passes. Then it will pass to the file 13 at the end of my desk, while better books get used for reference."
3,This one has been semi-forgotten here...,I got this for my daughter for Easter...what could be cuter then a little pig in the Easter basket (so I thought!)...well it was cute...and she loved to feed it and touch it and hear it grunt. She was very frustrated with the bottle and trying to feed the pig who wouldn't open his eyes. He doesn't move. He's not very soft or cuddly...and just stands there and grunts. He's quite dull actually. While he was fun for awhile...he's been forgotten...thankfully I found him at Target and didn't spend too much on him and so he sits on the bottom of one of our toy baskets....
1,not fun or cuddly,"this is not a fun or cuddly toy. The mouth does not open at all, which was very disappointing to my daughter since she expected to at least play with the bottle that it comes with. It's deceiving that they even have a bottle that comes with it. Besides some pig grunting noises & bending (which gets old quick) there's not much else to interact with. The pig's fur is soft, but because the inside is mechanically made it's not even cuddly, but stiff instead. After the 1st day, it's been pretty much sitting unplayed with. I would definitely recommend spending money on something else."
4,"We just had to have ""Wilbur""...","My son fell in love with pigs after watching ""Charlotte's Web"" so I purchased this as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas. I knew he'd love it because, every time he sees it at a toy store, he'd hold onto it in the cart while we shopped. He doesn't play with the bottle at all, but he finally has his ""Wilbur"" to sleep with at night."
5,An epic adventure worth reading!,"Dark Lord is the tale of one Elf's tragic journey through loss and pain, of sacrifices made so that good might triumph over evil. It is filled with colorful battle scenes, rich anecdotes, and delightful dialogue. A wonderful romance develops in Part two of the book, and the action is a constant roller coaster ride right up to the surprise ending. A fabulous story, not unlike Tolkien in scope and depth. Wonderful artwork, a thorough appendix called the 'Tome of Knowledge,' and a multi-layered plot makes Dark Lord a book that will keep you up long after bedtime."
1,Never Again,I ordered this jersey for my boyfriend for his birthday which happened to fall on Superbowl Sunday. He is a huge Steelers fan and this is all he wanted for his birthday. He wears a MEDIUM. I ordered a MEDIUM. A XXL was shipped to me! Needless to say I was not happy about this and the product was returned. Most likely I will never order from this site again.
3,"Same book as ""Don't Die of Embarassment""","This is a good book for somebody who's going through this experience, but please be careful you haven't already bought it- we bought this book and ""Don't Die of Embarassment"" and they are the identical same book with different titles, which is why I gave it a 3star rating."
3,A moderately good rite of passage novel,"The novel grabs one;you want to know what is going to happen. This is a rite of passage novel, an Odyssey, with some unique turns. It could have been much better. A little longer, more development of the characters,less muddy in the middle, and a little less chase would have all improved it. I would like to meet the characters again in another novel--and know what happens to them !!! There is a lot of potential for growth and development in these people.--as well as an extended story line. I developed a real attachment and identification with some of them. The novel ends with a dawn. I feel the characters are just begining to wake when the novel ends, much as a dream that we would like to get back to."
2,Rather disappointing,"Having read several good reviews from various critics, I lookedforward to this book's paperback release for some time. Unfortunately,while Lott seems to be have an adequate grasp of the language, hisstorytelling skills just do not rise to the same level.A whodunit of sorts is marred by an overly tedious narrative and far-too-convenient plot twists that ultimately lead to a flat climax. Furthermore, the story is tied up just a tad too neatly--when the person........... You've no doubt seen any number of cheesy James Bond villains do the exact same thing (""Since I am going to kill you very soon, Mr. Bond, it doesn't matter if I let you in on my little secret, does it?""). Ugh. Take a pass on this one--it's not worth the effort. END"
3,"Nothing special, Nothing Terrible","The characters and the references to the south are the best part of this book. I would describe it more as an action book than a mystery though it is a mystery as well. I thought too much of the book was focused on action sequences like car chases and people held at gunpoint to the point where the ""climax"" dragged on so long I got bored. As readers we were not really given the chance to know the bad guys so not as much mystery suspense was created as could be. Nothing horribly surprising either. I might read the sequel to this but I think unless it creates more suspense that will be it for this author."
1,Crappy battery,"Mine died after about 6 months, the original Sony Battery is still fine (AFTER 3 YEARS)Wouldn't buy another one"
4,Es un grupo original.,"Para que lo que piensen que es un grupo más, se equivocan. Creo que tienen el talento y la originalidad que muchos no han podido lograr en poco tiempo. Para los ""fiebrú"" como yo del rock en español, aquí les va la dosis que necesitaban. Es un grupo con canciones realistas, proyectadas de forma musical. Como todo grupo, están en la etapa de crecimiento y madurez. Al menos ellos crean sus propias canciones, nadie les escribe y ahí está la originalidad. Yo pienso que cada grupo de rock en la isla, (Puerto Rico), tiene su toque y su estilo que lo caracteriza y no se le puede catalogar del montón. Si eres de los que les gusta del rock suave, pero con el toque de una voz femenina, éste te va gustar."
1,A partially-accurately-filed book. Belongs in Humor instead.,"It's under Science Fiction - which is right. It's fiction through and through. It also belongs in Humor, as if one can wade through the painful grammar and style, one will find ideas that rank up there with the Journal of Irreproducible Result's for sheer madness and amusement. Platitudes do not a New Slant make."
5,National Geographic,"Hey, what can you say! Polar bears, National Geographic.....two of my great loves! You can't ask for more. Infomative, beautiful....perfect!"
3,Decent replacement,"This was a replacement to my original compaq power cord that lasted three years and two tours in Iraq, plus numerous other trips around the US. The price was better than fair, it shipped relatively quickly from the States to where I'm stationed, and it was very well packaged. It does what i need it to, and fits nice and snug to my laptop's power receptacle. I did also purchase a laptop surge protector, as power here is thoroughly unpredictable. The velcro cord-keeper is also a nice touch."
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this power cord in March and it worked well at first, but within a couple of months the connection became loose. I had to hold it with my hand where it connected to my computer to get the cord to power my laptop. After examining the cord I noticed that the 'male' part of the cord was very loose. It refused to work altogether by July and I had to order a different cord as a replacement. Not too happy with the quality here, but as I said, you get what you pay for."
2,Worked for 2 weeks,"I was happy when I got it. Everything was working fine, but ~2 weeks later, it just stopped working. I smelled the adapter and it smelled burnt..Couldn't refund it since it was considered ""hazardous""."
2,Wrong Laptop Adapter,"Every time I order what is marked as matching my laptop I end up with an adapter that isn't correct. I will end up contacting Compaq to get the right adapter. Online ordering, even with the right numbers, never works for me. I now have two laptop adapters that dont fit my computer. Not happy."
3,"Cheap, Short, and Hot","The cable arrived quickly after I ordered it as a replacement to my shorted-out charger. This adapter is a cheap, quick replacement. I seem to wear out these cheaper chargers every few months. This one gets fairly hot during use. The length leaves something to be desired as well at a little over 6 feet."
2,needs detail in the description,If you want me to buy your product first let's compare apples to apples. Where is the description detail? The size would be a very important piece of information for me to have to consider purchasing this item.
5,not at all like estee's pleasures,"I have NO idea what the person whose review said a better scent was pleasures....I hate pleasures but, absolutely love addict 2!!!! I wore it on my wedding day & have worn it ever since.I guess you could say I'm totally addicted x 2!!!! I smelled everything when shopping for my wedding fragrance, and after much deliberation kept going back to this one.It's fresh, romantic, & you just want to smell it again & again. I have since bought 4 bottles, as it has been 5 yrs since my wedding day. I still love it just as much & hope they never stop making it. It's such a great scent, u just have to smell it for yourself & fall in love! I can't compare it to anything else. Not overpowering but, not too subtle that you can't even smell it. PERFECTION in a bottle!!!!!!!! :)"
3,Dell Precision M6300 requires different AC adapter,"The Dell Precision M6300 requires a PA-13 a/c adapter, not a PA-15 adapter. The M6300 comes with a 130W-AC Adapter, PA-13 family, Dell part#X9366"
1,Horrible.,"Whoever said it was the exact same thing as the one that came with their Dell computer is either lying or got a cheap knock-off with their Dell.1) the cords are much shorter.2) all the materials look and feel much cheaper. The adapter itself is about 1/3 as heavy as my previous one.3) it would not even provide a constant power supply. It would cause my computer to flicker from battery power to plugged in repeatedly, especially when doing something ""strenuous"" like watching a movie or playing a game. This causes the screen to flicker on and off every time and then lag the computer for 1-2 seconds. Makes games unplayable.4) did I mention it's super cheap? It fell off my desk once (a whopping 2 foot fall) and now will not provide any power at all. I am currently typing this with the last 47 minutes of battery I have left on my computer."
4,Not for the unitiated,"I have been a fan of Ms. Baez for nearly as long as she has been performing and recording. (I once drove 430 miles to see her in concert.) I had a very good collection of vinyl and 8-track at one time, but time has take care of them. Now I'm rebuilding and this is a good album, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to those who do not know her work. There are many other albums which would be preferable to the novice. I found three of the cuts exceptional and all likeable (there is very little she has ever done which is not likeable). Sailing, Luba the Baroness, and Blowin' Away (title song) are the three exceptionals in that order. Cry Me a River is not her genre. She does it very well, but it's a definite ""who cares?"" I could certainly have done without it. Buy it if you are well prepared and knowledgeable, otherwise find another."
3,"Album has several shining moments, but......","BLOWIN' AWAY has several shing moments, but it's hardly one of Joan's best albums. The title track, however, is my favorite recording of this great song, which has also been covered by Ronstadt, Raitt, and most recently, Cher. Joan's is the best. The opening track, ""Sailing"", is also very good, and quite different from what you would expect from Baez, with multi-layered vocals and elaborate orchestration. And I love ""Luba, the Baroness"", which is Joan's own composition and really very touching. But those three songs are about it for this lesser album, worth having for big fans of Joan, but it won't convert those who aren't."
2,Ehhhhhhhh...,This is the only CD I have of Joan that turns me off completely. It starts off with symphonic music which doesn't fit her style at all and it really doesn't get any better after that. Her lyrics are always enjoyable but you simply can't get passed the music to enjoy her voice on this one.
1,"Another Speaker/Author ""How true is that?""","If you are looking for a book that offers you about 250 pages of grammatical errors, tenuous examples, and page after page of shameless self-promotion than this is the book for you. If not, then I suggest you keep shopping."
4,The simplist of ideas,THis game is but a simple one. YOu are Mr. Mosquito and your job is to s survive. TO do this you live with the Yamata Family and drain their blood. THis game is seperated into levels and in each you fly around find the target and strike. However if spotted you go into battle mode where you must strike specific points to get them to relax.THis game is sinmple and recommended to anyone with a sense of humor.
2,I Don't Get It,"I just can't understand the buzz around this band. No hooks, lots of experimantal noodling, poor vocals. They were described to me as sounding like Califone. Um, sorry guys. Not exactly. Go get Quicksand/Cradlesnakes if you want to hear experimental psych-Americana that actually hangs together and bears repeated listenings."
2,"shipment is ok,but the camera is not the one I expected.","I just got the camera. I'd say the price and shipment is satisfactory.But the worse thing is that on the first page for this item on amazon.com,it said ""2 AA batteries required(included)"".But actaully,I found it uses CR2 3V Lithium battery. THe other bad thing is that the rectangular viewfinder is totally offseted(not centered) in the viewfinder window, which means I can only see the above two angles of the rectangular viewfinder and the circle(I don't know how to call that) which is supposed to be in the middle is in the southeast. THIs totally upsets me.I am wondering whether this means bad quality or something...."
2,Disney approves mass lemming murder,"Ever since ""The Jungle Cat"" aired on Wonderful World of Disney when I was a child, I have been trying to acquire more of these wonderfully photographed wildlife ""documentaries"" in the True-Life Adventure Series. They are obviously staged, but well done for the times. So why only 2 stars? Another reviewer has written that Disney does not discuss the fact that they killed a few dozen lemmings in the making of ""White Wilderness."" It is not confirmed that Disney knew what the principle photographer was doing, but it seems that, if that were the case, they would not be afraid to discuss the issue. I am not buying this volume, as I would never want my children to learn myths (that lemmings commit suicide) about the animal kingdom, and I do not want Disney to think that I condone what they did. For more information about ""White Wilderness"" and the forced lemming suicide, see [...]."
1,It started in Naples,This movie will not play. It sucks and this is the second movie I hatten that won't work.i will not buy anymore movies for this reason.
3,3-Wheel Rollator,"This walker is very good for getting around in tight places since you can close it while walking. However, I do not feel as steady with it as I do with the four-wheel walker. Also it does not roll over bumps and uneven ground as well as the four-wheel. And it is heavy. On the plus side it is small enough to fit in the trunk of most cars."
4,Works As Intended. Better Than Nothing.,"I purchased this polarizer because of the low cost. It worked as a polarizer should and I was pleased with the results. However, it is not coated and I had to take extra precautions to reduce reflections on the surface of the filter. Up to now I had been using Hoya coated filters but at twice the cost I couldn't see going that way this time around."
3,"interesting, but too short","I bought this game because we had so much fun playing it on the demo disc. While I have not had much time to play the game, my children have had a blast playing it. Unfortunately there appear to be only a scant dozen levels. One child has already played it until the credits rolled. We had hoped for a couple dozen levels to keep the kids entertained. Now one as lost interest and the other two will soon follow. I hope that they are able to find other options in the game that will entertain them."
3,Dead On Arrival,"I've played a demo of this game before and it was loads of fun. So after a few years I see the game here at Amazon, so I buy it. It gets to me in a few days, undamaged. I put it in my PS2. At this point I already was concerned about the fact that the disc for this game was dark blue on the bottom compared to most with a sort of silver color. Well, it didn't work. I start hearing a sound that SOUNDS like the disc is attacking the inside of the PS2. The game came out a while ago and in the beginning there were more dark blue discs. I'm not sure what the difference is between silver and dark blue but I know that dark blue discs tend not to work. Just like my gameshark disc that I bought in the early days of the PS2. Dark blue was its color and it worked for a while but eventually it would say not a PS2 disc. So don't waste your money on a game that has a lottery of a chance to work on your PS2."
3,Thin Publication...Mostly Recipes With Little Else,"I got this magazine as the companion publication of Taste Of Home, (TOH). While TOH is a nice collection of articles and features, along with recipes, this magazine is pretty much a bi monthly set of recipes only, with a couple of short, not so in depth articles along the way. It's a thin magazine that for me is fit for mostly browsing, more than really reading. There is always a generous amount of recipes of all kinds with every issue, but truly without the entertainment of in depth articles and regular departments I feel you can do just as well browsing the web for dinner. Not really a bad magazine or rip off, but in my opinion still not worth it. I will probably end up letting it drop when its finished..."
3,Poor examples,"Personally, I do not like this book at all. The idea is you teach yourself, which may appeal to some people, but not to me. Why should I teach myself when I'm paying tuition? The book gives you a few very obvious facts, then expects you to build everything up yourself. This ends up a) being a lot of work or b) making the exercises very difficult because you've missed all the middle ground. Not my style."
2,Does not live up to the Century Optics name,I got this because I though that the quality would be great (since it's Century Optics).It's twice what other 0.55x cost and it's no better.There is serious blurring on the edges at wide zoom.I would recommend you look for something else.

3,Sadness,Guess there's been enough emulated on the screen and in prior books that nothing was new here. I would rather read a spy novel.gene kay
3,Pretty good--but be careful,"The book was very informative and easy reading. Considering the depth of psychological issues, Faw did a great job. There were some ways in which I thought the author was a little bit too accepting of certain things, such as hypnosis. (He did, to his credit, say that he does not claim to be right on everything, but is merely suggesting possibilities to be considered.) Although I disagree with him in some areas, I appreciate Faw's willingness to put aside prejudices and look objectively at the issues. I definitely do not recommend this book for anyone who believes things because they read them and doesn't think for themself. However, if you can think for yourself, this book will give you some great things to think about."
4,Boook,It was a book I needed for a certain class so I doubt I should have the authority to comment on how good this is
5,Justin Lanning,"Boy has this guy tapped into my childhood pain! I thought I had exericised thosedemons years ago, and there they are with each listen of this record. I founda funny video through a link on youtube that led me to his myspace page -his myspace WORLD is more like it - I've never seen anything like it beofre(after it takes 5 minutes to load of course).Great songs, incredible voice and overall good vibe - certainly a welcomechange to all the crap that is on the radio - YUK! Anyway - I like it andits worth a trip to his mypace page just to check it out - if you don'tlike the music you can't help but love the world he has created there!"
2,Pale Copy of Mr. & Mrs Dave Barbour,"This is a collection of early work by Dave Barbour and Peggy Lee. The style is early Lee, tight, girlish and true. The arrangements are slight, and it all sounds as though it had been recorded in their front parlour. A song or two even fades out in the middle. Too bad. The engineering is off. They are both first class musicians, and deserved better care in the presentation especially in such an early record of their work. Dave Barbour, as we all know, never seemed to have grown as a musician; drink took him down with it. Peggy Lee grew in many directions, and the sound of her here makes it miraculous to contemplate how this could have come about after such a beginning so typical of the style of the era of her start. It's a must if everything Peggy Lee recorded is in your must list. Otherwise not. Instead, start with Pete Kelly's Blues. Now that's a must."
1,Piece of junk!!,"I was at the beach recently and put this filter (67mm version) on my 70-200 f/4 IS. My images immediately got very very blurry. I took the filter off and everything went back to how it should be. This wasn't subtle: everything was blurred about 10 pixels, at 200 mm. I was totally astonished: I've heard of cheap filters hurting image quality but never seen it myself. I took a bunch of shots with it on, and a bunch off, and got the same thing over & over again. Shutter speed was fast and I was on autofocus, so this wasn't a user or camera issue. No scratches and the surface was clean, and reflections weren't an issue. Reading reviews on Amazon confirms that I'm not the only one with this problem.The filter's well-built, turns well, and comes in a fine case. It *looks* clear and sharp. But in use -- what a piece of junk!"
5,It great,"I usually buy these order books at the store, but the likelihood of them having the books in stock was iffy. Nice to be able to order them and know they're coming."
5,Excellent even for non-gamblers,"I am no interest in gambling, Las Vegas or craps. Never the less, this was an interesting read due to the well defined characters, tight storyline and brilliant insight. I will look for his other books."
4,Engaging on several levels,"For being his first novel, this is very well done. It is surprising how many different subjects the author is able to bind into a cohesive story (The Divine Comedy, Craps, Physics, Piloting Airplanes, the Mob, Direct Mail, etc.).I agree with several reviewers regarding the sporadic crudity; it detracts from the story in the few places it's used. For me, the end was confusing, but possibly makes sense to someone who has read the Divine Comedy.Summary: Engaging on many levels, a quick read, and surprisingly good for his first novel."
4,A great fictional comic book that could come true.,It is a well written comic book by Star Wars' Mark Hammil. It shows what media can do to a simple situation and how a man must react to that now complicated situation. The plot is great with a very surprising and pleasing ending. I thoughrely enjoyed this comic. It includes sketches made by Mark Hammil himself. It also includes all the covers since this is the whole series in one. Well worth the money.
4,This book is filled with lots of sound information.,"I read the book when it first came out. Then, I had a hard time adhering to the principles set forth. Time and experience have brought me back full circle. When I started reading this book again I was amazed at how much I had grown and how the principles seemed do-able and the recipes sounded delicious. I am still struggling with food combinations. At the moment I am hoping to find somene out there who can help me out with questions I still have about the book."
4,Fit for Life,"Exactly what I expected and the programme is very effective. Although the first few days were a little difficult, I have found the changes to my body shape profound. Fluid retention down about 80%, weight loss to date (2 weeks) is around 12lbs, no more cravings or hunger pangs and I feel very healthy. This is an effective way of eating pure, wholesome, fresh food and wakes you up to the defunct nutritional crap we shove down our throats every day. I hope I can continue to make it work for me over the coming weeks, one day at a time! Well worth the purchase."
5,Not just another diet book this is more.,"If your serious about living life to the fullest then Harvey & Marilyn Diamond's book is a must. It is not easy to follow at first and it will sit on the shelf for sometime but you will come back to it time and time again. In studying how to be healthy you will see why ""Fit For Life II"" is the next best book to own and use"
4,Informative!,"Apocalypticism in the Dead Sea Scrolls is well written and informative. The basic thesis in this book is the differing Apocalyptic views that prevailed during different periods of history, with the Dead Sea Scrolls being the main subject. I found this book interesting, and informative without criticism. There is also information in here as to the book of Enoch- very early beliefs. From there it goes to Dead Sea Scroll sects and the expectation of messiahs, the teacher of righteousness, rewards and punishments in the last Apocalyptic days. This author, John J. collins, wrote an excellent overview of similar but varying belief systems. He goes to show how history has affected and altered beliefs, but not completely! This book is well worth its price for anyone interested in Apocalypticism."
5,Montana Humor,"Paul Stanton, of Milltown, Montana, has been publishing humorous postcards (Duckboy Cards) for several decades. The cards are for sale in drugstores, gift shops, and truck stops all over Montana and neighboring states as far east as Minnesota and as far south as Arizona. This book is the first collection of those cards. All of his cards are black and white photos of people in surrealistic or funny situations. As his market spread outside Montana to other northern and western states, he gave them more generic titles, e.g., ""Cowboy Designated Driver"" rather than ""Montana Designated Driver"" (a dog with the reins in his mouth taking a drunk cowboy home on horseback).This 1997 book was the first of two collections of Stanton's cards. The second, published in 2004 and entitled ""Extreme(ly Dumb) Sports,"" is equally funny."

3,"Decent playing, lousy arrangements","Well, apparently I'm in the minority, but I found this CD disappointing. I bought it because I fell in love with ""Song to the Moon"" when I heard it on the radio, but this track and possibly the ""Londonderry Air"" are the only ones worth listening to. Although the melodies chosen for this album are indeed beautiful, the arrangements (Rieu's own) are poorly done. I would much more highly recommend Joshua Bell's Romance of the Violin, which has a similar theme, albeit restricted to classical tunes."
5,Exceptional Game!,"I have never played the original Mario 64 before, but I heard this was probably the greatest game made for the DS and I can see why! The excellence of the graphics, sound, and realistic physics make this game a huge hit. It is unbelieveably fun and addicting, and will have you playing non-stop for hours! The mini-games also definitely make the game worthwhile. Very slight lack of control without analog sticks, but the touch screen can make up for that. There aren't any glitches as far as I can tell. Overall, Very fun game for the whole family. I recommend it for young and old."
5,Old and New,"This game is something that you might be missing if you're a fan of any of the Super Mario games.I was a big fan of nearly every game that Nintendo put out featuring the title character, but specifically loved when Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 came out. It contained some of the most fun and instantly replayable challenges in any game....ever.I was skeptical when wanting to buy this game for the Nintendo DS, but some of my friends told me it was well worth it, and I have to agree. Not only is it just as fun as the original, but you get some added bonuses in the other playable characters not in the original game. Definitely a 5 out of 5 in my book."
5,a classic i love,"im a veteran to this game and i must say i am impressed, it was covering old terretory with new add ins. the only flaw was the controls are much harder but the gameplay is smooth and graphics are the prime of a handheld. that is wy i give it 5 stars=)"
5,gggrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttt,The best game for ds ever better than the oringinal loads of fun you shoud buy this game.
2,This game is cheesy!,"I bought this game after saving up all me money for approximately 3.14159 years. I went to the store, and bought it. Then I went to my car. Then we drove home, but I was discouraged because my driver ran 3 red lights. I went inside, and ripped open the game. I got my DS made by Nintendo most likely in China (where labor is cheap). Then I put the game in the DS. Then I turned it on. Then I played. There are many new characters that I have never laid eyes on. They're names is Casper, Lowry, Jefferson, and Logan. They is much bigger than the Nintendo characters, but them has more nicer personaloties."
2,Pretty Good,"At first before I got this I thought it would be the best game ever invented.But then after I beat Bowser the First time, the game got kinda impossible. You cant find any more stars and it gets really boring. I found myself playing the mini games more than the actual game. And after a while I played the Metroid Prime Demo more.So over all, people are relly overestimating this game!!"
4,Nintendo 64 re-make for the Nintendo DS,"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: Eschneider6Super Mario 64 DS for the Nintendo DS is a remake of the old N64 Super Mario 64 game with some new changes.One of the new things is you can control Mario with the touch screen or the control pad. Second, is that you can play as Mario, Luigi, Wario or Yoshi. Third, is you can open up a plethora of great mini games by catching rabbits, some of which are more fun than the main game and give you hours of enjoyment.The main game is the same as the N64 version, however the graphics and control are a bit better on the DS. This is a great game to have for the DS. Some of the mini games especially show off the power of DS. I recommend this game for your Nintendo DS library, as it gives you your Mario fix until the new Mario Bros. game comes out.My Review Score for this game is = 8.0(Score 1 is throw it out, 10 is a must buy)"
4,Super Mario 64,"This game is soo cool... it has a reck room you play mini games with it. One of them is really cute it is loves me or loves me not. It is not like the old ones. Yoshia starts and Mario and is gang are trapped by browser, so if you really love Mario you would wanna save him. Yow can also draw pictures of Mario and Yoshia."
3,aloha Mario fans!!!!,"as all of you know, mario and his super hot girlfriend peach (her name is a kind of fruit. I wouldn't name my kid this but whatever.) A new evil is unleasheddd!!! Shy Guy is at it again. He stole peach's silver medalion and now has the power to rule the seas. Mario and his super legion of cheep-cheeps (pardon the pun) must return it to peach to make things right again. You can not only play as mario, but also his friends, oscar, Jed, alex and Moe. (What a team!). After you accomplish this, Bowser steals the medallion(go figure). After a surprize accident injures Mario, its up to oscar, the leader of the furious foursome, to save the day. eventually, you can play as peach, and participate in special races unlike any before (riding on chain chomps is exciting)! Make sure to obtain all of the item boxes, or else things might get sticky. thanks for reading!"
2,Very disappointed,My whole family loves Super Mario Bro. for the DS so we bought this. VERY disappointing. Nothing like super Mario very hard to play and figure out. Never play it waste of money
5,"Interesting, Meaningful, Inspiring Book",This book is a delightful way to learn more about Christian history in small bits at a time. It is inspiring to read about what Christians have done as they seek to live out what God wants for them and thus make a difference in the world.
3,ok,if you are a heavy person or not good on your feet not good for you. HINGES ARE CHEESY. Easy to install. I do not see this lasting long if you have kids.
5,Even Better than the first!,"I thought his first CD was good, but this one is even better! ""By Name I Have Called You"" is so beautiful, I find myself singing it all day long. ""Teach Us How to Pray"" is another of my favorites. This CD has a more Jazzy rhythm than the first one. Beautiful music, John!!!"
1,Save Your Money--Don't buy this cd,"The second cd from Angotti is monotonous and boring. I have 3 children and listen to Barney, Wee Sing, and other childrens' songs so I can tolerate just about any kind of music. But this cd was so long and every song was just like the others that I couldn't wait for the cd to be over. ""Rise Up My People"" was much better and Angotti could have used a peppy song like this on ""Common Ground""."
3,so so book skims info,"If I had pulled this book off the shelf before buying it, I wouldn't have bought it."
1,P.U.,"a totally fictionalized auotbio/memoir. author was 2 yrs old, yet recalls events as if she was really there. The prose is vapid and purple. far from being a non-person, she and her family were part of the old elites/reactionaries. of course they suffered; that was the point of the popular revolution. save your m,oney, this book is an awful bore and poorly written"
4,Polarizer filter 37mm,"works how it should, no complaints, seems like it would be easy to break the thresh hold if you put it on wrong"
4,Helpful and informative,"As an occupational therapist who treats patients with fibromyalgia and other arthritic diseases, I know how frustrating it can be for my patients to be BELIEVED, let alone diagnosed. Please be aware that everybody and his brother has written a book on fibro and you can be quickly led down the wrong path. This particular topic seems to be rife with misinformation and opinion. Research has proven that pain modification is best accomplished through attitude, level of activity and amount of sleep. See a rheumotologist. Find a program with physical therapy, occupational therapy and aquatic therapy. These therapies have a lot to offer, especially hope."
1,Does Not Offer Trustworthy Information,I find this book to be poorly documented and have found a number of errors. It does not appear that the facts were checked by the author. I therefore cannot trust the information and do not recommend this book or this author.
5,Can't believe the price I paid for a priceless book,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR PEOPLE DIAGNOSED, &/OR THEIR FAMILY, IN ORDER TO TRULY CONVEY TO OTHERS (LIKE DOCTORS & THERAPIST) WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON WITH YOU."
5,Fantastic Informational Book,This book I highly recommend to anyone that has Fibromyalgia or for someone that knows someone effected by this disorder. So much information and easy to read material. Fantastic !!!!!!
3,"fans have to have it, but a tad disappointing...","Don't get me wrong...I love Garbage to death, and am glad I have this collection. But why oh why isn't ""Androgyny"" and ""Breaking Up The Girl"" on here? And why couldn't they put the new video for ""Tell Me Where It Hurts"" on? Plus, the ""When I Grow Up Video"" is the ""live"" version, much less exciting than the video version most of us remember seeing (which I thought was the main one). The live version is kinda boring; and I love the song ""Shut Your Mouth"", but the video here--new to us Americans--is kinda just so-so. Overall, thankful I have this, but really missing those 4 videos..."
4,Just know what you are getting.,"These things will definitely stay where you put them. No problems, just don't confuse with the hard rubber type that will slide around."
1,Mediocre at best,"These lifts are mediocre, at best.The shape has a steeply-cut front edge, which is often uncomfortable underfoot, particularly when the lift slides forward in the shoe - it should be tapered. The material used collects lint and dirt, and this makes it even more prone to move forward in the shoe, as it masks the stickiness. The one good quality I can think of is that they are easy to wash - the bad news is that you will need to do so frequently."
3,"Review of Cambion Heel lift 1/4""","This heel lift has been a great help in straightening my curved spine and relieving my symptoms of sciatica. Unfortunately, after less than 6 weeks of wear, it is falling apart. I'm not sure whether it is because I have to move it from shoe to shoe or what, but the rubber is cracking and chunks of the heel lift are coming off. I live in a very dry climate so that may have something to do with the problem. I thought $6 was way cheap to give me such good relief, however if I am going to have to purchase a new lift every 6 weeks or so, it will be a lot more expensive than I had anticipated. Also, the lift is not very comfortable, it drops off abruptly. I have to wear an insert on top of it or put it under the inner sole of my shoe if it has one that will lift up. Even with these not so good things, I am now committed to the lift and will continue to wear it."
1,Title misrepresents content,"I felt seriously ripped off by this film. It may be that I didn't read the product description with enough attention, but I anticipated the DVD would include some footage from the original filming of Pancho Villa during the revolution.In addition to my disappointment, I felt the movie was marginally mediocre! Bandares was O.K. but the movie lacked any depth of character or story line.My advice is to save your money!"
1,A large pile of hourses**t served as history...,Such shame... such waste of time... such insult to history... to real people... such hollywood arrogance ... how much did this cost again???!!! I am sorry I can't even finish watching it...
3,not as good as it should have been,"Banderas is superb and captures the contradictions of Pancho Villa perfectly. Arkin is also excellent. The rest of the film is highly uneven. The first half is the most solid part. It's a charming tongue in cheek historical adventure and Banderas and Arkin shine. Things crumble as the film moves towards social commentary, heavy drama, and Hollywod insider stuff. This 'film within a film' film tries so many different angles that it loses it's focus and the whole thing unravels. It's really a shame this didn't end up being better.Three stars for a solid start, Banderas, and Arkin."
2,disappointed,"amazon is great , I have not had any problems with deliveries, purchases etc. Unfortunately, this dvd was very disappointing. I was fooled by the price, meaning it was alot more than most the others so I thought this must be a good one!!. Wrong, it was ok. Short instruction, short dance time to an actual song, dvd froze, and the ""many more"" dances than listed on the cover was a joke etc. If it would have been $10. I wouldn't have cared but $50.???!! What really upset me in the end though, was that they would not return my money until I removed all my comments and reviews about their product. So now that I have my money..here it is. You can keep your dvd and I won't ever order from shaun again."
1,Party Line Dances by Shawn Trautman,We bought this for exercise purposes because we have minimal line dance experience and with a little instruction we thought we could get both instruction and exercise. Wrong. We got the instruction in a painfully slow format and very little music for exercise. Would not recommend unless you have never seen a line dance.
1,Worst Phone I've ever owned,"I hate this phone. I switched to this phone from a Blackberry. While I like Windows Mobile better, this phone is a disaster. Why?1. Hard Booting - I have to remove the battery to re-boot this phone a few times daily because it freezes, or stops working in some manner.2. Reception - It's hard to hear conversations on this phone, the speaker must be poor, and the reception (even though I have the same carrier as my previous phone) is extremely poor. It drops calls constantly.3. Dialing phone on the road/Stylus - I don't know anyone that can use a stylus to dial a phone # while driving. It is almost impossible to dial a phone # using your fingernail.Don't buy this phone."
2,Noble 2,"Phone is not very ""User Friendly"". Stylus requirement is a challenge.Sprint stores do not sell a replacement Stylus, and neither do CompUSA or Best Buy. Memory card must be purchased separately.Price is way too high."
5,Works great,Works great for hooking up a touchscreen to my PC. I've been using it for the past few weeks and have no complaints. Well worth the money!
4,What an odd and handy Mother's Day gift,"My first impressions of the Scooba, the floor-washing robot on the iRobot line (the makers of the Roomba, the vacuum). It was a present this Mother's Day from my grown son and daughter. After reading the specs on their website and letting the son and husband play around with it before setting it to work on the kitchen, I certainly enjoyed watching it go! It picks up dirt and large particles of matter before scrubbing with the Clorox cleaning solution. I was skeptical about the drying ability but the Scooba did a siphoning motion and sucked up the used cleaning solution. It took about 40-45 minutes (which I think is standard but I'm not sure yet) for the Scooba to mop and dry our 11 by 13 kitchen. I drained the dirty fluid into the sink, rinsed out the chamber and patted myself on the back for all my ""hard work"" that Sunday. Definitely a great tool for the busy individual."
1,"Paralyzed on slate floor, the retarded cousin of Roomba","Pros: concept of a hard floor wet vacuum cleanerCons:- gets stuck all the time on uneven slate floor, lacks clearance below- gets stuck all the time under kitchen counter, shelves etc, lacks power to pull itself out- foam wheels deform after sitting on floor for a while, way too soft and lacks grip- cannot recognize water, complains empty tank- fixed cleaning time, lacks intelligent timer/algorithm to cover the whole room then stop- does not cover entire 200 ft room, leaving dry spots here and there- uses uncommon 4/3A battery cells, hard to find and expensive to replace individual cells- battery pack is sealed and unserviceable for non-technical people"
1,Scooba - don't buy,I brought a Scooba and it never worked well. It fails o clean for more than a few minutes and then quits. The manufacturer will not stand behind their product. It is a piece of junk. We are back to mopping floors. It works much better and is not the hassle that the Scooba was. Total waste of money.
5,Great Robot! A lot of fun to see it working,"This robot is just fun. And most importantly it does its job perfectly. We have a hard wood floor and this robot just cleaned every bit of it flawlessly. The only place it need some help is those corners, but I guess I can live with it by just mopping the corners myself, takes no more than 1 min to clean those places Scooba missed, but if I were to clean the whole room, it would take hours. This thing can be programmed so that it cleans when no one is at home. Just how marvelous to leave the home with a messy floor with food crublings and all and returning to see a shining clean floor.Battery life is good enough to clean my kitchen and living room (the only place we have wood floors). Some reviewer complained about the noise, I don't think the noise is too loud, actually a very funny sound the Scooba makes so I know he's working hard.I would highly recommend this robot!"
1,roomba good--scooba bad!,"i've had a roomba for 4 years and love, love, loved it, just recently it died after a series of different problems, but it worked so well for years i really feel i got my money's worth and bought a new 1. i was so excited about the scooba and bought it just a few months after it came out --- it doesn't compare at all.the scooba is horribly sensitive, it stops it's clean cycle all the time pretending to be stuck, even though it's standing free in the middle of room. and, it never actually drys the floor. but, judging from the amount dirty water pouring out of the dirty water bin, i imagine my floors have been cleaned. the last time i used it, it didn't use all of the clean water, which is strange because it usually tells me it has run out of clean water a few minutes into the cleaning cycle. this tempermental mistress was a complete waste of money, though i still recommend roomba to anyone that will listen."
1,Dont buy it!! It doesnt last more than a few washings,"I bought my first Scooba from Linens and Things. I was impressed with it the first time I used it. Then a couple of weeks later, I tried it again, and it wouldnt work. I called IRobot customer support and she couldnt resolve the problem. Luckily, I was able to go to Linens and Things and get another one. I hoped I just got a lemon. The next one worked great for the first time too. A couple of weeks later I tried again and it wouldnt work. I charged the battery for over 24 hours (it should only take 16 hours max, per the manual). But when I pressed Power, it wouldnt turn on. Customer Service could not resolve my problem and told me to ship it back. Of course, I get stuck with the shipping costs. 2 units, and neither worked after the first week. Coincidence? I dont think so. DONT BUY IT. Its not reliable!!"
5,Utterly Amazing,"First time out of the box, took me 5 minutes to setup (after charging the battery overnight), and the Scooba immediately proceeded to clean up ink and marker off our light tan hardwood floors. Utterly shocked it cleaned so deeply so quickly. It does leave a little dampness behind, but not enough to ruin the floor or leave watermarks.Like the Roomba, the Scooba is easy to maintain and does a good job working around obstacles in the home. One weird behavior is that the Scooba gets stuck over our floor air vent, in which case it beeps, displays an ""I'm Stuck!"" message, and we just move it.Best of all, I get to play XBox while ""scrubbing the floors!"""
4,Washed and dried tile floors surprisingly well...,"until it stopped working a few weeks ago. It repeatedly started the washing cycle and stopped after about 2 mins. I'll call iRobot and update here regarding their customer service; that is if Amazon allows second reviews. If their CS isn't customer friendly, then I'll buy another Scooba @ at a store that gives a Lifetime Warranty..a bit more expensive initially but not in the long-run w/the Warranty."
3,Needed instructions,"No instructions or shipping order included in package. Otherwise, product was just as expected and worked well."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I was very disappointed with these tests, especially since I had fairly good luck with the OPKs from this company. I took one of these tests the day before my expected period and after ten minutes got what appeared to be an evap line. Since it took about 10 minutes I tossed the test. The next day I used a First Response and got a strong positive almost immediately. The following day I took a Clear Blue Easy Digital with the same result. Four days after my first positive result I used one of these test strips just for fun and received a very faint line- again at around 10 minutes. My suggestion- avoid the confusion and heartache and pick up a Clear Blue Easy Digital. It's the easiest test to read I've used."
5,Inexpensive and successful on the first try!,"After two clomiphene-induced pregnancies, the latter of the two ending unhappily in a miscarriage, my wife and I were finally ready to try again, but irregular cycles made our wish for another pregnancy quite difficult to achieve. We decided to purchase this test kit and a 10-pack of extra ovulation tests after reading some of the reviews, and we are very happy to report that tests now point to a pregnancy again. We didn't feel that the warnings about the lack of clarity of the results on the ovulation tests was all that justified, the results came back quite clear. Use was easy, the instructions were clear, packaging was good (and in a neutral envelope), and the price was certainly right. So, we would definitely recommend this combination. It saved us from another round of clomiphene quite easily."
4,Good for the price,Very quick delivery from the seller. The positive band for Ovulation strips never gets as deep as the control bands. But every thing other wise works.
3,"Worked, possibly?","I used the ovulation sticks for the first time. I'm 29yo, but figure I might as well start off on the right foot. I used the ovulation sticks 11 days after the first day of my last period (I think that's when I am supposed to start--if not, please correct me for future use). Anyhow, I used about 9 tests. On day 7, I got a faint line, and on day 8, I got a darker, but still faint line and on day 9, no line at all. I never got a dark line so never a darker line then the control line. According to the directions, that means I never had a LH surge, so I'm not sure if it works. So far, no period and no positive preg test yet. Will test again in 2 days. Question for all, are you supposed to have intercourse once the test line shows positive or before? If before, how would that work?"
4,"Fun, if you remember the show","This story of Batmania varies considerably from Burt Ward's account, but West's book is a fast, easy read filled with some nice photos. Disappointments include few insights into the famous special guests (West was too busy doing the show to socialize much).His pre Batman experiences are entertaining as well (Remember, West did a 3 stooges movie).Overall, an average accounting of a fad television series--enjoyable to those who loved the show, but not meant for those who didn't"
2,not happy,The key diagrams were not readable on my cloudreader edition. I was very disappointed. Some early chapters needed those diagrams to understand any of the concepts.
5,cliff with the london philarmonic orchestra,"Truly superb! This is cliff richard with the london philarmonicorchestra recorded live at the royal albert hall in 1982;conducted by richard hewson. I think the versions of the songs onthis album are the best. The pieces are:Green Light, We dont talk anymore, True love ways, Softly as I leave you, Carrie, Miss you nights, Galadriel, Maybe someday,Thief in the night,Up in the world, Treasure of love,Devil Woman. Check out a detailed reviewof THIS album mistakenly posted for the CD: The Hit List. Thisalbums version of We dont talk anymore, and Miss you nights is in the CD :Cliff 1980s. Compare with other versions of these songs on the CD: The Whole Story and judge for yourself."
5,Good plugs. Noticeable improvement in starting and pep.,"Installed these plugs on a Toyota Tundra v6 model. The truck was sluggish and gulping fuel. I installed these plugs, some new wires, a new fuel filter, and new oxygen sensors. The improvements in idling, acceleration, fuel consumption, etc... were impressive.The truck runs good. Tune ups are important.Great iridium spark plugs. Price is reasonable for what you get."
4,So Far So good...,"Installed on a Early 00's Subaru Outback 2.5 liter, and installation was simple enough. Paired this purchase with NGK Plug wires and a Felpro Valve cover gasket kit. Arrived in perfect shape and the fit was correct."
5,"Nice Quality, Good Value","This is not some cheap, weak-kneed polarizer: you could see to the bottom of the ocean with this. The UV filter was also clean and clear. Definitely a good value.n.b. I ordered this from Electronics Expo, and it took nearly two weeks to arrive with bottom-rate shipping."
3,"UV good, Polarizing bad","Maybe it's just defective, but the polarizing lens give me noticeable image degradation. The images are blurred and easily seen even at 1:4 scale and with a tripod being used. Cleaned it just in case but still the same issue. The UV filter however is perfect and I'm very happy with it."
4,"Great value, difficult to remove","Both filters seem to be high quality. This is my first polarized filter, and I am impressed with its performance, but have nothing to compare it to. My only issue is that the polarizer can be very difficult to remove from the UV filter if you tighten it too much. It also may turn too easily, but it has not been a problem so far.I needed a UV filter to protect my lens, and for just a few dollars more, I got this set, so I would say it is a great value."
4,One of the better but not the best,"Not their best album, but still excellent quality. includes a cover of Prism's ""Open Soul Surgery"". They seem to have experimented with a couple tracks on this album but they still turned out great."
4,This is a great album,"I love this album, I bought it when it was first released, mainly because it contained Dino Danelli & Gene Cornish from The Young Rascals. I have worn this album out over the years, I love the vocals, but I really love the songs. I had a friend burn this album down to his computer because I couldn't find it anywhere on cd. This is the 1st time I've seen it here on Amazon. I hope they finally burn it to cd."
3,The X-Files meets real life in Lobster Boy,"Through extensive interviews with nearly all parties involved, both family and police, Fred Rosen reconstructs the events surrounding the life and death of Grady Stiles Jr, the ""Lobster Boy."" Following a profitable sideshow career, capitalizing on the congenital defect known as ectrodactyly (fingers and toes are fused to form claws), Stiles was murdered in his own living room, victim of a hit man hired by members of his own family.Was Stiles a man who had tried to make the most of his handicap and live the American dream only to be taken advantage of by his spouse, or did he use his deformity to hide years of abusive behavior, verbal and physical violence that eventually drove his own family to take steps to protect themselves?A fascinating true account of life being stranger than fiction. Comes with a dozen photo pages so you can see the strangeness for yourself."
4,Interesting and easy read,"This book was very interesting to read, and it is a great book if you want to read something that is not very intellectually challenging. The writing style is rather poor, however the author does get the point across (through copious use of cliches). Besides that, the story is gripping and will appeal to anyone who has a fascination with the unusual, grisly, or macabre. Also will appeal to people who are fascinated by daytime talk shows, due to the family dysfunction revealed in this book. Overall, a good book to read to relax your brain."
4,Trying something new,I like the idea of eating gluten free when possible due to the fact that I am diabetic and a heart patient. Some of these recipes sound like they will be really good. The book has clear crisp pages & writing and the recipes are very understandable.
3,Carol Fenster wheat free cooking,Looks like a great book of recipes. Although you must mix up ahead of time a flour mixture that I do not have room to store as we are full time in our rv. Seems like all recipes in the 2 books are this way so someday when I have the room and space I will try but for now the 2 books are at the bottom of my recipe book pile.
3,not very useful,does not work for what I wanted...for some it might be okay. I cnnot recommend because I DID NOT find it useful for my purposes. I wanted the WHEAT BELLY COOKBOOK and this is not it
4,Wheat Free Recipes and Menus,"This is an excellent source for gluten free recipes and menus.I bought the it specifically for the menus and I like them a lot.I do wish there were more vegetarian menus. I have the same complaint of all of Carol Fenster's books.One complaint I personally have, I'm not a big fan of cilantro and found this to be a major ingredient in many of these recipes, it would be nice if there was an alternative herb to use in place of it. I've found that cilantro is one of those things that people either love or hate."
4,good mix of garbage,"the remastered sound and collection of essential songs from the first 2 garbage albums alone make this worthwhile. however, it is skimpy on 'beautifulgarbage' material (""androgyny"" anyone?), and drops at least one if not 2 worthy inclusions from 'bleed like me.' the version of ""#1 crush"" is from 'romeo + juliet,' which is the nellee hooper remix. the original (from 'subhuman [""vow""]') is still a stray b-side. apart from the aforementioned omissions, this is the most up to date mastering of the songs that are included. great mix for those that are unfamiliar with the band, and almost ""absolute"" for those that aren't."
4,Where is Supervixen???,"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Garbage. However, I think ""Supervixen"" is by far one of their best songs. Why the heck is it not on this album?? Plenty of songs on here I could replace with that hard gem. A bit of a fail, no? Maybe on the next greatest hits album..."
1,quite noisy,"this timer is quite loud and noisy--very distracting for the task I needed it for. It also doesn't want to stop correctly. I have to continually turn the dial to zero and back to get it to final stop making a ticking noise. It also doesn't ding every time. Overall, a poor product in my opinion."
1,This timer didn't last,I used this timer maybe four or five times before I burned a meal and discovered the timer had 'stuck' at ten minutes. Several more tries (with no food in the oven) and the problem repeated itself each time . Don't waste your time on this one.
2,Would be great if didn't BREAK ASAP,"Bought for my daughter to help her time bath time. She loved it until it broke after less than 5 uses. If made better, it might be worth it."
1,Doesn't work a'tall.,"Mine just doesn't work; that is, it ticks around but doesn't ring at the end of the set time."
4,Great Illustrations,"While the pictures are great and it is a good concept, it has not been a big hit with my 17 month old daughter yet."
1,an unfortunate trip,"This book just proves to me that anyone can publish a book,regardless of talent or capability. The author surelymust have been experimenting with the drugs featured in thebook while he was writing it. There is no coherence, its intellectually pompous, and leaves the reader feeling like they want the time back that it took to read it."
3,setting the pace,"In this book, Cam, Carole's boyfriend is pressuring her to step up the pace, but Carole's not entirely sure she wants to. Callie must come to terms with what happened out in the woods with a former friend who has turned into a stalker. Lisa might have to move, although she has half a senior year to go. And Stevie is training her mare for three-day eventing."
5,Good book.,"The book is pretty good. It's hard to beleive that Lisa's mom wants them to move to New Jersey. Stevie even thinks about putting a blond wig on Micheal so Lisa won't have to go! Then she get's a little more logical. I also can't beleive Lisa and Alex's decision. Now about Carole... Suprisingly, Cam may be out of the picture. Forever! Cam is really annoying. You'll have to read to see what happens. This is a really good book!"
4,tell the truth,i think this story is tryingto teach kids to tell the truth because something could happen if you don't. in the story the pitchures were perfect for the text. the pitchures would better if they were more colorful though.
3,sims meets rpg,"The Sims Urbz is a game that combines the features of the Sims(everydayliving obligations) plus the Rpg games of the 80s(Think of Kings Quest). It is set in a NYC type of environment. Your mission, whatever group you choose, is to foil the plans of Daddy Big Bucks.What I like:1. You can save your progress.2. Unlike the other simulation games that use the DS platform (think Nintendogs), if you want to lay off for a few days, fine; you can pick up where you left off. There is no dehydrated and starving Sim to worry about.3. It has a Kings Quest format. I enjoyed that game on PC.What I didn't like:1. The instruction manual is not complete. There is nothing about saving the game or placing an item in your living quarters,for instance. I had to figure this out through trial and error.2. Unlike Sims 2 for DS you cannot play with another DSer.3. Does everybody have to use inner city lingo?"
3,Nintendo DS is supposed to have better graphics...,"But you'ld never know it from looking at this game! The Urbz for Nintendo DS is nothing but the GBA version with the feature of having the screen on the bottom available. That is my complaint with this game.Otherwise it's basically The Sims Bustin Out for GBA re-done for a big city. I still am enjoying the game, as it gives me something else to play on my DS, but I've found the game play hasn't changed all that much from the previous game.If you're a new DS owner and you're looking for a game to take advantage of all the DS's power, I would suggest you look elsewhere in the limited selection of games for the DS. If you're a Sims Platform fan, you'll enjoy having the ability to take your Sims on the road much easier then you could before."
3,this game is strange,"this game is definetly among the strangest games ever, your guy is always acting cool and talking about his house being a ""crib"".But the music is good for a handheld and the minigames are fun,also people i nthe game tell jokes, but the story is cool. Daddy bigbucks is trying to ruin everyones life by giving everything expensive fees.How will he do that? by buying sim city! he's that rich, has funny hair and you have to stop him. there's no shooting i n this game and I would not reccomend it."
5,A perfect addition the technical library,"Simply put - a must have for the serious web based application developer! Rarely (if ever) do you find a gem such as this, which serves as an unparalleled reference guide for the Java architect, provides a leg up for experienced software developers looking to delve into writing web applications using Java, as well as gives web designers some insight into server-side programming with Java. Nowhere else have I seen a work, in such a practical manner, fully explain Java web application architecture and how to implement JSP and servlets together, and apply them beyond HTML, to create XML documents and files and even applications for the wireless web! Also, where else do you find all this as well as indepth coverage of security, EJB, CORBA, and RMI?"
4,New Testement Aocrypha:Gospels and Related Writings,"In Good shape, a bit pricey for the wear and tear to the book, but am still satisfied."
1,Haier ice maker,"This appliance rates a zero star. A piece of trash. it worked for two days only. I called Haier and it would have costed just too much for shipping and insuring it. So, I trashed it. I'll never purchase another Haier product ever."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF @#$%,THIS THING DID NOT LAST 4 DAYS BEFORE I HAD TO CONTACT THE COMPANY. THEY WANT ME TO CUT THE CORD AND PEEL OFF THE SERIAL NUMBER AND SEND IT BACK BEFORE I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT. BAD QUALITY AND JUST A CRAPPY ITEM. TALKED TO SERVERAL PEOPLE AND EACH ONE GAVE ME A DIFFERENT STORY ON WHAT TO DO. STAY AWAY FROM HAIER PRODUCTS....BURER BEWARE
4,It's fun...,"My mom and I picked out this game for my sister (Christmas gift), even though she hasn't watched the show. She loves playing it (and I've loved joining in); our only complaint is that things get repetive after awhile. Same comments, same moves, same songs, same outfits. But, if you don't plan on playing for hours at a time, and over consecutive days, it should be a lot of fun!"
2,an ok game,"the new codemasters game blows this one away but this game is ok too. but these are the bad things about itonly 20 songsnot the real judgesthe ending ""is bad""you can't do any of the audition stuff you start right at the final two which dissapointed me the mostno singing just dancingwhen it says style with thousands of looks don't get excited because there are not too manywhen it says over 20 hits don't get excited because there are onlt 21 or 22 songs in this gameI used to think this game was the greatest but now codemasters came out with one this game has hundreds of improvements to make.I wouldn't reccomend this game to anybody (unless you collect this stuff) otherwise get the codemasters one."
5,So COOOOOL!!!!,"2.11 MEGA PIXEL / MP3 PLAYER / VOICE RECORDER (Digital/super quality), Digital CAMCORDER in ONE!!! Super small!!! (less than 1 centimeters thick!!) It fits in your pocket!!!! Camera is better than Canon A60 I had. The flash is so strong and NO NOISE WHATSOEVER even at ISO 200 ! So much details. Oh yes, it comes with every accessories in a box!! case, memory card, strap, MP3 software, cool Japanese style earphone with remote, and much more!!! Battery lasts for 10 HOURS in one charge!!!! It has docking station that you can charge and do whatever you want! Nobody notices when I take pictures because it is so small. Don't buy cheap camera phone that is only 0.11 mega pixels and cost half a thousand, save money and get free phone and this SUPER GADGET!!"
4,An unusual book. Fun to read and surprising.,"""Shiloh Renewal"" came as a surprise to me after reading Ms Woodruff's first fiction book "" Neighbors"". Her style, certainly on the leading edge of popular literature, tranports us into the deep south and catapults us into a desire to empathize with the period and the characters. We find ourselves crossing over time lines as we are taken into the reality of a young accident victim. The book is abrupt in its closure, but exceedingly memorable in its content and the author probably intended that the reader would be left somehow wanting more."
4,"arrived fast, amazon prime is the best...",one thing i can say about this product is it works good but the writing on the back can be very distracting if you work with circle shape because you really cant see if the logo is straight. so i have made a alternative choice to use longated oval shape or square so i know the logo will come out correctly.. i want to try the avery dark color sheet but five sheets is very little..just reminder to mirror your image when printing or you will have just a printed logo you cant use...
1,Don't waste your money,"VERY disappointed with this product. I have used other transfer papers that crack a little with wear and washing, but at least they stay adhered to the fabric. I made a few attempts with this paper (and regretfully sent items to my customers) and not one survived even one washing. They ALL peel off. Buy another brand, at least then you will have a chance!"
4,Great title...,... reflective of the story's plot with well developed characters that had you rooting for Reed and Mallory all the way. My only unresolved question was 'What happened to Clint L.?' He seemed to have vanished from the story towards the end of this novel. Loved this!
4,Works well for inexpensive filters,I needed some inexpensive filters for occasional use and was very pleased with how good these filters were for the price. Both filters work quite well.
5,Worth every cent!,"There is simply no better bib. I don't understand what problem the other reviewer had; she didn't say. She only advertised another brand...Bumkins are absolutely the best. Soft, generously sized, non-staining, easy to clean and quick drying!"
5,Excellent starter,This is an excellent little book for beginners and others. It has plenty of pictures and texts covering many aspects of UW archaeology.
1,Didn't work,"I had high hopes for this item....Although my device (Toshiba e405) runs Windows Mobile 2003 which is supposed to be compatible, it froze up the instant I plugged the card in. Every single time. I tried resetting the Toshiba a few times, fiddled around with the setup trying to get it right, reinstalled the software etc., etc.. I emailed the seller several times over a 2 week period and got zero response. Can anyone help me figure this out? How can I find out for sure that my device is compatible?? Any tricks required??"
2,never got it to work with palm 700wx,"I never got it to work with palm 700wx - could be user error, that's why I don't hate it."
4,Almost as good as Don't Say No,"For some reason I waited until last year to finally get this album. I was a fan of Don't Say No the year that it came out. I bought the next album after that and then started to lose interest in Mr. Squier (the video for Rock Me Tonite may have been a reason why, LOL). I had heard that this album was pretty good but I did not realize just how good until I took a chance while looking for something new from the past. It's not quite as solid as DSN, but of the nine songs I think six of them are gems and the other three are not bad. Tale of the Tape is quite a step forward compared to his two albums with Piper in my opinion. I'm very gald to have added this album to my collection."
4,Tale of Tape - A hidden treasure,"This is my first review, I don't get much time to write -but I had to make the effort to spread the word about this lost gem of an album. All the songs here are solid, its almost as great as Don't Say No. This is by far Squier's second best record. It's classic early 80's power rock at its best. It's somewhat raw - but that is what makes it rock, it's not over done. Unfortunately Squier's later records don't match the quality of the first two. I had to smile when heard some rap song copy part of the song Big Beat , a few weeks ago. So apparently someone has access to music although getting CD seem difficult - thannk God I still have my LP !"
5,excellent overview with great pictures for beginning pilots,I enjoyed the book and its pictures whcihc make understanding the conceepts easier.
2,Atrocious instructions,"I haven't even used the machine yet and already I'm unhappy with it. It took me more than 30 minutes to assemble it, working from instructions that were almost indecipherable and pictures tht looked like they were drawn by a second-grader. I found that if you dodn't put the thing together in exactly the right way (which the manual didn't bother telling you about) it would not go together. There were also parts that came with the machine that were not described in the manual. Once I use it, I may be happier, but I can't see why the manual can't be clearer."
1,Great machine!,This cleaning machine/polisher is great to remove tough carpet stains and also to buff my laminate kitchen floor. No more tempermental steam machines for me.
4,Eerie,Described in one word? Eerie. This excellent film ended with a total unexpected climax that was both eerie and chilling. Outstanding cinamatography and brutal visual splendor lend to this compelling story that ended with a twist that is unexpected.
3,Dark!,"This movie starts as a 'dark' story of survival - ends leaving the viewer wondering how it ended even more dark than it began. Technically well done, thus the high rating."
5,Great Read!,Got hooked on this series thru Kim Harrison's page.... Love it! Buying the next one ASAP! Going to read her nextseries as well. It's action packed with a great story line...
3,Great idea; imperfect execution,"Fascinating concept and much-heralded innovation in psychological analysis could have been woven into a classic but the result falls short. As a prior review points out quite helfpfully, S. (the subject of Luria's analysis) uses ancient mnemonic tecniques of which the author seems ignorant, although the most cursory research in the field of memory would have revealed them to him. Readers should not repeat Luria's error; read Frances Yates' ""The Art of Memory"" after finishing this book.In addition, Luria relies far too often on the subject's self-description and analysis even in matters that could have been tested or at least observed. As a result, the impact of the subject's psychological condition on his day-to-day life is addressed but only descriptively; the subject is not brought to life or ""humanized"" as commentators claim. The subject could have written this book better himself."
3,Great read,"This is a great historical account that would benefit anyone interested in military history. There are many modern books available today, however there are those like this which should be standard reading, I highly recommend it."
3,Does not do what it says it does!,"I saw this in the movie rental store, and the back cover says that it 'blends messages of hope, healing and love'. Well, it does none of those things. It starts to, and then something tragic happens that dashes all the' hope, healing and love' that was starting to happen. I rented it hoping to be uplifted, and instead came away simply depressed. Danny Glover and the other fine actors are great, but the dark plot overshadows their performances."
1,HIGHLY OVERRATED,"How these guys rose to cult standing is beyond me. They recorded three pretty good songs, but most of this material is boring, indulgent tripe."
5,Truely amazing,"I bought this c.d. awhile ago at an smc concert, and I didn't really listen to it until recently, and MAN was I blown away! The songs are just totally out of this world, they are all so beautiful. My personal favorite is #5 on the 1st dic...Still I Rise. I think everyon would benitfit from buying this c.d."
5,311' Best Work,this cd is truly outstanding i dont care who u are youll love this cd---311 is a band that is master of all style-this cd is one of the most under rated cds out there and one of the most underrated bands...buy this cd you will love itEvery song is a stand out track
2,The worst 311 of them all.,"311 is a pretty good band, but this one isn't nearly as good as ""311"" or ""Transistor"". I haven't listened to ""Grassroots"", but I hope it's not as bad as this one. Buy the self-titled one first then ""Transistor"". If you're even gonna buy this c.d., but it last!"
5,Infectious,This is definitely one of those few CD's that you love the first time you hear it. Their following CD's never seemed to grasp the same funky groove.
4,Reduces shedding,"We are on our second gallon of Optima 365. I am impressed that even in the hot weather, shedding seems less. I will continue to use this to help reduce my dog's shedding."
4,"Cute, but not up to PIxar's usual standards","I enjoyed the film, but I don't think I will watch this one repeatedly or will find myself quoting characters, scenes, etc. I was very excited for Pixar's first true heroine, but unfortunately the story wasn't too original."
4,Good animation but somewhat old story,Very good voice acting and a cute story line. Nothing new or innovative but a good story about relationships. Really good animation and really good British actors to provide awesome vocals and acting.
3,"The movie was intriguing in one sense, bearable in another","I loved the state of the art animation, and I liked the image of a strong, independent young woman maximizing her pure potentiality.I experienced great difficulty accepting the transformation of her mother into a bear. That just didn't work for me. Maybe my reaction is an individual anomaly. I hope so.Overall, it was definitely a film worth watching. I believe I would recommend it to adults with some reservations. Small children might not even blink at that ursine metamorphosis."
4,Cute,"I liked it. Cute movie, entertaining. I do not know that I will watch it again. I think it is a great family movie."
2,"Rushed, bizzarre and hard to follow","Usually I enjoy Disney/Pixar works. That being said, this has got to be the poorest attempt at a decent story line I've seen in a while. The characters are enjoyable and the overblown cultural stereotypes will bring out laughs. After the movie is over, however, you'll probably be left wondering exactly what you just experienced. The moral component of this story is humility over pride and love over control. Some of the ideas were really good and the graphics were incredible, but the story is so disjointed and incomplete that it brings the movie down - way down. Some of the bear scenes as well as the witch scene will probably be a little too much for younger kids."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected a movie with a very broad and sweeping cinematic scope to it. And also some fierce troll or ogre battling coming of age tale. Instead two of the main characters are piggy-backing one another throughout the whole film. They do not take a journey to a far off land to find the crystal sword that will push the protagonist to discover some profound meaning to life and become protector of her land. Instead the main scenes mostly take place in the castle and the nearby wood. Then again it is a PIXAR film which means by proxy it is a family oriented production company, so far, so I should have known what I was getting into when purchasing this film. It has it's moments..."
3,"Great animation, good story",Its almost worth watching just to see how amazing the rendering of her red hair is. Worth watching but not at the awesome level - maybe because it repeats a variety of earlier tropes.
4,"Great movie, disappointed in ""HD"" quality","The movie itself is fantastic. Epic tale that is both heartwarming and breathtaking. 5 stars for the movie itself.I would give the quality about 2 stars however. I paid the extra money to stream the HD version from Amazon Instant video and it wasn't even close to HD. It was grainy, standard at BEST. Very disappointed Amazon."
2,A Mediocre Release and a Big Let Down,"I went into this film realizing it was rather polarizing and tried to have an open mind. The animation quality was top notch but the story was not very well done and the main character was unlikeable, whiny, immature and ungrateful.I love most Pixar films and I've enjoyed watching many of them over and over but I have no desire to ever see this again. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
3,Good,"Disney movies always seem to be good. I do think they're running out of ideas. This movie is good with some very funny parts, but not as good as I'd hoped for. It's worth watching atleast once."
4,Brave,Very good for the who;the whole family. Brave is a Pixtar favorite. Adults will appreciate the annimation.You will want to rent this movie.
4,Brave is a pixar delight,Another good production from pixar. The spunky heroine is terrific and the message of learning to accept one another as we are is very poignant and heartfelt.
5,lovely typical pixar movie,"for all ages! enjoyed it very much, nearly watched it twice! Lovely plot and scenery. Those three little brothers are especially fun to watch"
4,I like it,"I love disney! Very cool story and characters. The three brothers are the comedy in this movie, and the storyline is great."
4,cute,"I like this disney movie, not my fav, but I like the meaning behind the story. It's different from the most disney movies and I like that about it. I did have a problem with the disc itself and I bought the movie through Amazon. For some reason the blu ray disc wont play a couple of seconds at the very beggining of the movie and my blu ray player automatically turns the movie off so I have to wait for the part to come up and fast forward it so that it doesnt do that."
4,Good movie for young girls,"Loved this movie! Always loved entertainment that showcased girl power! Also a good movie for families, especially mothers and daughters, to show each other's perspective, how that can harm relationships, but yet show that each can learn from the other, and see each other in their light, not in stereotypes."
3,Good for Kids,Good story and humor but most good animations have enough humor for adults as well but this does not. Kids will enjoy it more than grown ups will.
2,All the best parts are in the trailer.,"I expected a lot more after seeing the trailer. Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer (ie. the arrow split in two in the bullseye), you've already seen the best parts of the movie. The first 20 minutes or so were very good but then it devolved into unexciting nonsense. I'd say it may be better for small kids but they might be frightened by the vicious bear attacks."
2,Disappointing,"Just not up to the typical Pixar standard. Beautiful animation but VERY disappointing story. I'm sure it appeals to children but adults will find it lacking. Not nearly on the same level as past movies (Toy Story trilogy, Up, etc). Here's hoping they bounce back!"
5,Unexpected pleasant movie!,"I was very surprised at the way this movie was beautifully created and written. It was not at all like the previews suggested, but still a pleasant film from Disney and Pixar. The attention to detail was spectacular and the way the water rushed down the river and off the stone of the castle wasn't something I had been fully prepared for, much less the detailing of the bear's fur and own maiden's curly locks! The plot of the movie was an interesting moral tale that I'll let you watch to find out for yourself how wonderfully written it is! Overall a well thought-out, gorgeously animated film to be watched over and over!"
5,Brave,"Great movie! I look forward to watching it again. Great storyline and message for children of all ages...be careful of what you wish for, you might get it. Also, girls need to talent, smart, strong and brave, so they can have a say in who their life partner may be. I will be watching it again."
2,Brother Bear in 3d.,"Brother bear in 3d.Pros1. Great music and animation.2. Humorous at times.Cons1. Original? ""Brother bear"" in 3D?2. Story.Weak.Conclusion.Great animation.Not a Pixar quality."
1,"WASTE of a CYBER MONDAY for a ""GOOD CHANCE"" at Brave","I am sure the product is fine, but I waited online for more than 3 hours to try and buy Brave at the discounted rate. I wouldn't have bothered had Amazon not informed me that I had a ""good chance"" of getting a copy when I was originally waitlisted. I was able to see the percent of other deals that were being bought, but unable on the only one I was supposedly on the waitlist for with a ""good"" chance of getting. I waited there in good faith for 3 hours like an idiot but my ""good"" chance never came through and the deal just expired. PERHAPS AMAZON SHOULD CONSIDERING UPDATING YOUR CHANCE AT GETTING AN ITEM AS OTHERS ARE GRADUALLY SOLD, THUS CHANGING THE ODDS. I don't enjoy wasting 3 hours under false pretenses."
1,Disappointed,Expected better plot. Received a different impression of plot from trailer. Not at all what I expected. I was disappointed.
1,a bust for pixar,"I usually love Pixar movies. In my opinion, they've always delivered great films. This movie, however, was truly disappointing. The trailer made it out to be more of an adventure film but instead we got a cheesy and unoriginal animated feature. This may be because they replaced directors mid-film. We'll never know what was originally intended for Brave and while it may be a shame, there's no use trying to find a masterpiece where this is none."
5,good movie,I enjoyed the movie and decided to purchase it for myself. It's funny and I love celtic things so it was easy to see we needed this for our collection too.
4,another hit for pixar,"I like all of Pixars films. Though this is not my favorite one, i bought this specifically to add this movie into my Disney collection, but more specifically, to my 3D movie collection. The movie is great to watch in 3D. Great music, good story."
4,Great at theatre...but don't find myself watching the DVD often...,"I LOVED this movie at the theatre....so, I bought the DVD for frequent viewing. Yet I don't find my self watching it often. I am glad I bought it though. The visuals are fantastic...the setting and theme are unique...the story is positive and uplifting. It would probably have more ""repeat"" appeal if I were a kid..."
4,Wonderful,"Do see this as it has myth and magic and humor and as with most myths has some very good lessons, a fun and good film"
3,okay movie...,"Nice enough, storyline was a little week, but the rest of the movie was great. My sister and I watched it."
2,Waste of time!,"Besides the usual glitzy animation from Pixar, there's not much in this movie. There was clearly a lot of investment in getting the physics of curly hair believable, so kudos to the technical wizardry, but the story was a total disappointment. Everything happens more or less between two principle locations (castle and the ""stonehenge""), visited repeatedly by the main characters, although the canvas for this story could have been much bigger. Humor appears in the wrong places and several scenes are stretched too long (e.g., the bear chase in the castle). The actions of the princess, such as giving her mother an unknown spell from a demented witch, are simply too ridiculous to believe (unless her bravery is compensated by a low intelligence)."
1,Very Disappointing,"I found this movie to be extremely disappointing in content (however, the graphics were beautiful). I will not be showing it to my 8 year old daughter. The main character, Merida, gives her mother a magical cake without even knowing what it will do to her. That is completely irresponsible and disrespectful, and not the kind of message I want to give to my children."
3,Not as good as it should of been.,"I like all kinds of movies and had high expectations on this one but, it fell short to me mainly because the story should of been better.In some ways too simple and other ways didn't go anywhere; the story went places that it should of."
2,Good movie bad streaming service.,"This movie was good and I and the grand kids enjoyed watching it. However, I had to knock the picture quality down to unacceptable levels to keep the story going without constantly reloading. I have a measured download speed of 15 Mbps and a wired connection so from my perspective the problem was at the Amazon end!"
3,"Good story , kids will love it.","Enjoyed it , good entertainment for the holiday. The message is what matters in a good film and this one had an excellent one."
3,Confusing message,Disney films usually have a more clear message. Great animation but weak story. Won't be one of the classics in my opinion.
4,Phil's. corner,"Good little movie..... Super video quality, fun and relaxing without to much heavy thought.... Great movie for the whole family to watch and enjoy....."
3,Could Have Been a Home Run,"I have been a Disney fan since I was old enough to see their movies in the theater, I'm 46 now. Then I became a Pixar fan and have enjoyed many a family night watching Disney/Pixar movies. This movie had all the ingredients of a great film but somehow missed it. Perhaps it was that none of the men in the movie had good character? I understand that she is the first princess to not fall in love but did it have to be because no good men exsist? As a happily married woman of 21 years I refuse to believe they couldn't have a man of good character in the movie, even if it was her father!A side note...I loved her hair!!!"
3,Did anyone else's 3D disc freeze during play?,"I was very frustrated to find that the 3D disc would freeze during play. I removed the disc and checked the back for any scratches or prints. There weren't any. I cleaned my player and popped it in. It happened again in different parts of the movie 26 to 30 minutes in. I had to play the regular BluRay disc, which played fine. I was really annoyed because I bought it for the 3D experience. I believe the 3D disc was defective. Did anyone else experience this?"
5,GREA!!!,"IT was GREAT!!! I loved it!! It also had wonder 3D effects, it was a perfect movie for the family"
1,Not for kids and no plot.,I am an avid Disney/Pixar fan. I was not impressed and am my sure I would let my kids watch this. The animals are a little frightening and it was not a good move.
1,auug!!!,"Totally can't believe I received two damaged DVDs in an order. Imagine my shocking disappointment, not only was the picture split into two screens, the color was off. And the redhead characters were blue!! Movie night ruined. Does not deserve one star."
1,Disappointing for a Pixar film,"My wife enjoyed the movie's mother/daughter theme much more than myself, my 2 boys and 1 girl ... as such, perhaps Brave is one of those films that resonates with a certain demographic. However, I was turned off right from the title and cover shots of the film, which reminded me too much of Braveheart. And, while watching the film, all I could think of was this film is a horrible collision of Braveheart, Poltergeist and Brother Bear. My kids ranging from 12 to 2 sadly also agreed :("
1,"I'm not rating the movie, I'm rating the DVD quality",The DVD quality is terrible. I watch movies on my computer and this movie won't even play on my computer. It has some kind of copy protection that literally makes it unplayable (all the titles on the movie have a length of zero seconds).Why would Disney release a DVD that is so far outside the DVD specifications that the movie is literally unwatchable?I'm going to buy the Blu-Ray version. Maybe I can actually watch that version.
3,Not what I expected,"I watched this movie because my son enjoyed it. I thought the storyline would have been more about saving her clan, village, etc other the relationship between her and her mother. That being said the movie itself was entertaining but not a major hit."
2,Was expecting more,"Movie was really not worth watching that is my opinion, what a waste. 10 seconds of genuine emotion when mom was expected to turn back into human that's it, she was even bossy toward mom when she was a bear. Animation was good but I think plot was dreadful. They should have had the spell do something to the bratty girl instead of mom changing to bear. but we are entitled to our opinion."
4,Another great Pixar movie,Great story and animation. My entire family of six enjoyed the movie. It is one of those movies that we will enjoy seeing again.
4,Great movie.,My family loves this movie and it is a lot of fun to watch. We still watch it at least once a week.
5,Brave,Amazing quality. Great watch for the entire family. Glad the rental time is up to 48 hours. Nice place to watch new movies not available on Netflix.
3,I expected more from this movie.,"Visually stunning, this is a good film. I can't help but feel that the protagonist was supposed to break the mould and be strong and independent; but instead seemed reckless, irresponsible, and a little annoying. Her archery was really cool, and the family was really fun, but there was something lacking."
4,Makes Up For Cars 2!!,"I'm glad to say that Pixar has righted the ship with their first venture into the fairy tale genre. The story, though not as original as previous releases, is still very engaging, and the voice acting is spot on. Any caveat I had with the story is more than made up for with the visuals; the movie looks beautiful, and I'm still scratching my head as to how they created that full head of red hair."
4,Fun,"Its was a fun family movie. Not the best from Pixar, but definetly not the worst either. I recommend it!"
1,Boring,"This movie did have good animation. That is all it had. There was poor plotting, characterization and not much action.How to train your dragon was much better."
1,"If you want to expose your children to witchcraft, sorcery, and spell casting this is your movie.","I would have never guessed that a movie geared for kids would have such evil undertones. We watched this with movie with our 4 year old and will definitely review our G rated selections more carefully in the future. Witches, spells, and a mother turning into a bear definitely raised questions and caused angst for our daughter. Ugh."
5,I love it,Best movie ever! I like that the princess doesn't have to marry the prince to be happy. Great talking point for all those little princesses-to-be. I can't get over the fantastic animation of Merida's hair!
5,Excellent movie for all ages,"Excellent movie for all ages. Humorous but educational for the kids and adults. Good viewing for everyone, with a happy ending."
2,Brave,In my opinion this movie is a disappointment. It falls far short of the products that have been produced by Pixar in the past.
3,Weak storyline,"My daughter loves it, but she also loves Barbie movies. It is weak compared to other Disney films. It was like the thing was written by the marketing dept ro hit a release schedule."
3,Eh... all in all pixar's worst,"The movie has some entertaining parts to it. The basic premise isn't that great. The little brothers and the dad are entertaining. Truthfully, when the mom becomes a bear the movie takes a huge dive. It's just plain boring and lost me. Ending is fine. Without a doubt pixar's worst yet."
2,Good movie - poor quality stream,"The movie was enjoyable but the ""HD"" quality couldn't even be considered SD quality. There have been no issues streaming other HD movies through Amazon but for some reason the quality on Brave was so poor many scenes were barely recognizable."
5,Great!,Good story and excellent animation. I watched ii twice. A different twist on an old fairy tale. I found it to be most entertaining.
4,Engaging,"Quite an enjoyable story with many likable and amusing characters.I can only fault the lighting in ""scary"" scenes toward the end, which, in streaming over the Internet, were too dark to make out much of what was happening. This took the edge off the experience, leaving an impression of mostly ""what just happened?"" I hope that this is not the same on BR/DVD."
4,Good Show,"Amazing hair animation, good story. Yes another Disney ethic girl story. Here are the 9 more words I must write."
5,Great Movie! Can't play on Kindle Fire HD,"I do a lot of shopping with amazon and have always been happy with service. They have even gone above and beyond to get a shipment to me in a timely manner before I was even a Prime member. I own a Kindle Fire HD and I can't transfer the Brave movie to it due to the DRM protection. I don't think this movie and the Kindle should be a suggested sell together, if they don't work together. I do have the digital copy version of the movie and it does not work with my kindle. I notice that they now have ultraviolet copies of certain movies that will work. Wish they would make those available as an upgrade to customers who bought movies through amazon prior to the release of ultraviolet, expecting digital copies to work on kindles.Loved the movie though. Really cute. A little scary for our 3 year old, but she still likes to watch it. She just runs onto someones lap for the bear parts."
3,Good movie bad case,The movie is great but the inside of the case that holds the DVD was broken. It may be a packing problem.
3,It was okay,I wasn't that impressed with this one. I mean really do we need another movie encouraging disrespectful behaviour and attitudes toward parents for any reason.....no.
3,Not what I expected,The story was slow and so was the plot development. It actually wasn't that great. They need to try harder.
5,Best Kids movie,My daughter loves this movie. I do too. It has a great message hidden about mother-daughter relationships.Thumbs up for Disney one more time.
5,A New Meaning For Brave,This is an excellent meaning with a great new meaning for brave. This will encourage all to embrace their fearless nature!
4,Looking For Light Family Entertsinment,"We rented Brave because we wanted something other than bang bang shooter up! We found this movie delightful. Great animation, good humor and story line. I would recommend this film to anyone."
2,Weak,"There was not a particular aspect of the movie that was particularly disappointing. It was just weak all around. The animation was good, but the storyline and character development was shallow and predictable. It was like watching a high quality Saturday morning cartoon episode. Plus the message for children was not exactly exemplary: while your defiant spirit gets you in trouble, it can also get you out of it. Hmmm... dunno about that."
2,Fairly dumb,My wife rented this a while back and sorrily disappointed. It was nothing like the trailers had portrayed it and the story in and of itself isn't very compelling.....
3,Meh.,"Instead of paying to rent this movie, I decided to just buy it. Having buyer's remorse. I LOVED Tangled, which is one reason I bought Brave without renting it first. Brave was ok but I just didn't fall in love with it like I did with Tangled. I'm not sure why, it was just boring. Worth the price of a rental, not buying the DVD."
5,Great movie for young and old,"My 4-year old niece wants to watch Brave every time she comes over, and I'm happy to oblige her because I enjoy it as much as she does!"
5,Lives it,Great movie. At first I didn't like it but as the movie played I liked it more. Still don't like the main character though. What she did was awful
5,Brave - the DVD,"It was a real success! Wanted to watch it immediately, but needed breakfast more! Thanks heaps Also purchased the Dream Fairy earlier on, for my grandaughter - what a surprise. Loved it."
2,Streaming Quality Poor,The movie itself was not too bad if you like Disney movies. Nothing spectacular about this one. I streamed this from Amazon and the quality of the picture was poor. Many scenes had poorly defined pixels. My high speed internet connection was working fine. So I can only conclude the problem was on the Amazon end of things. Perhaps their streaming services were too busy at the time or maybe there is a problem with their stored video content for this particular movie. I watched Ice Age 2 (a better movie by the way) the next day during the same time frame and the quality of the picture was perfect.
5,Loved it!,Great Mommy - daughter movie! Loved how it portrayed the daughter's journey to realizing that Mom was pretty great afterall. Also loved how Mom realized that sometimes you have to bend a little.
5,Mothers and daughters should see this movie.,"Awesome story line, awesome movie. Would definitely see it over and over. One of my all time favorite Disney movies."
3,Incredible imagery. Story line ... meh.,"The imagery and animation were incredible, but I wasn't particularly sold on the story. I don't regret the download and viewing, but I will not be adding a hard copy to the collection."
5,Brave,"So much is going on in this film that you must watch it repeatedly. Funny, heartwarming, beautifully done. Loved the accents!!!"
5,Heart touching,I thought Brave was an incredible movie. It shows how a parent and child can butt heads yet still really love each other. My 7 year old and 5 year old were scared by the movie. They both are to a point that they understand death is final or a friend moving away is extremely sad. Watching the daughter beg her mother not to leave her was incredibly sad for my boys. They did not want to watch the movie again. My husband and I loved the movie because it showed our sons that we would go to the ends of the earth and beyond for them. And I think they got it!
5,Adorable!,I absolutely Loved it and so did our family!! The story line was precious and the graphics were amazing!! Wonderful!
4,Great For Families,It is a great family movie. Good story and wonderful animation! Would recommend for any family with children that like a little action with their collection.
4,Powerful,"The title says all in this action packed, girl-impowering movie. Young Merida is a typical teenage girl who loves adventure, which is unfortunate for her mother, the queen. This is a great mother-daughter movie and I highly suggest it to those who know that there is bond that needs to be mended between you and your daughter or you and your mother. This is not really a manly movie, so I suggest it for those who dont want to see The Bourne Legacy or The Avengers."
5,Loved this movie!,"But it is for an older audience. My daughter is almost 3 and loves a lot of Pixar and Disney movies, this one she couldn't get through. My husband and I loved it though."
3,Okay for a family movie night,"If you do not mind spells and hexes, you may enjoy this film.My family enjoyed the graphics more than the story line. The Queen as a bear is hilarious and the triplets as cubs sealed the deal. So over all it was cute.Also, I am not on hundred percent sure but I don't think black or brown bears can be found in Ireland. Wait! Maybe they are found in the area that the film was set in. Not sure. Accuracy is never a big deal in Disney animated films.kisses!"
2,Not a great movie,Not a great story line. I feel like this has been done before. I guess this would be OK for kids but not Pixar's best. The title is slightly misleading.
3,Gorgeous visuals but disappointing story,"I was surprised to see this has a total run time similar to many other Pixar movies because this one accomplishes very little in that span. The narrative is very focused on the mother-daughter relationship, but the lessons are trite and it seems to focus on those characters to the exclusion of any other developed character. Aside from the father, it seems like every other character is relegated to a mere cameo."
2,Lame teen angst movie wrapped in half-assed Scottish mythology,Weak tea. Don't bother. The storyline is insipid and uninspired and entirely predictable. The characters are pretty standard cliches with little (if any) development during the course of the movie. The music is cloying and generic Lilith Fair derivatives. And it really has very little to do with bravery. The art direction and animation is decent but not really anything that we haven't already seen.
3,Very nice movie,"Nice story, about finding one's own way instead of blindly following what is traditional or expected. Graphics are very nice."
3,It was ok...,The animation was amazing. However I didn't care for the moral/message of the movie. It was ok to view but We won't be purchasing the DVD for our personal library.
5,This is some good salsa!,"Though a couple of the songs are a little slow the majority of these songs are happy, fast moving songs that sound like you're at a latin party. This is an excellent salsa album and I've been listening to it in the car for the last month since I've gotten it. When I play it I feel moved by the music back to the salsa bars of the island.If you like this you might want to check out Salsaton by Andy Montanez."
1,this sucks man!,What do you want to know?I already told you it sucks.I mean I bought it and took it home and inside the box there was the wheel broken!Can you belive this crap.
3,Deserves better than 1 star in my opinion,"because calling a second-place finish ""magical"" has too much comic value to give it a 1-star rating. But this book needs to be re-classified as fiction--just like the Walk of Champions."
4,Catchy Tunes,"Very cute tunes for young children to learn by. The songs for the ""States"" and ""Presidents"" are fun and educational for the whole family. Only drawback about ""Presidents"" song is that it ends with Clinton!!"
3,"was good for a while, then went bad","bought this to replace my bose headphones jack, after about a year the factory edition broke so i purchased this, assembly was a little complicated but if you know how to solder you should be fine. used it for a few months then the jack stopped working in my itouch. had to wiggle it to make it work at first but eventually it became such a pain i had to add an adapter. overall, its a nice product but it has a few design flaws that need fixing."
4,Cell Talk Review,"This is an excellent textbook-style discussion of intimate cell biology fused with Upledger's own deep insights into the nature of our own inner consciousness. A must for anyone looking to understand the deeper links between physiology, energy, health and healing."
3,ambivalent,"I would love to say that this product made me look younger, fewer wrinkles, diminished age spots, anything. But alas, there is no turning back the clock, or apparently, the skin. I still use it, being ever hopeful, but don't expect any more from it than an ordinary moisturizer."
1,Surpisingly cumbersome and unintuitive,"The good:- good software performance- good software garanteeThe Bad:- cumbersome and non-intuitive drawinf tools- no capability for a grid background of any type- no ruler bar or any type of static measure facility- no right-click properties on objects so I didn't find where to set wall height.- incomplete help index i.e. terms used in pop-up messages that are not in the book or help.- 3d view was excessively cumbersome, would've been nice to have single-click mouse controlI was very disappointed"
1,Try Again and Again,"Sorting through the various home design offerings here, I found generally weak reviews for every product, but this one had at least a few supporters, so I gave it a shot. Don't do it! Horribly cumbersome and tedious to use. Not user-friendly. I have things I can't delete; I want to swap floors around but you can't once they're created. You have to start over from scratch in a new document if you make an error. Absurd not to be able to cut/paste/delete at will in this day and age. Oh, and I couldn't orient the plans I did develop to print to fill just one sheet of paper. It insists on printing the entire work area (most of which is blank). Wasted many hours. Have found something better. :)"
3,Light and Easy,"This is a cute book. It does have a great beginning and I, like some of the other reviewers, felt like it went down after the marriage. As far as Simon's secret, I thought it was pretty obvious what had happened and would have preferred for it to be a bit more mysterious to his secret heartache. I was also thrown off by the time line. I'm thinking months are rolling by then you find out toward the end of the book that it was simply a few weeks. There was no real obstacle preventing this couple from a happily ever after, just the waiting for someone to DECIDE to it-which watching people sit and think can slow down the pace of the novel. Still, this book can be described as a light, easy read."
2,a bit drawn out and oppresive,"I don't wish to sound insensitive to Simon's pain and guilt, but ""pain & guilt"" are so omnipresent in every scene that they become the main characters in the story. Annie and Simon are the supporting characters who make it possible for P & G to do their thing, and that is not a comfortable situation. I'm glad Annie and Simon were able to squeak out a happy ending in the last few pages, but I was exhausted by the time it happened."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I really like these characters, Annie, Max, Laurel, Dora, Emma et al, and the sense of place, Browards Rock is great. I don't really read these for the mystery aspect, so I wasn't looking for that, but this started with a really great premise, Annie's long lost father. That story line somehow got lost in the confusion. Not one of Hart's best, but an enjoyable read for a rainy afternoon, with some great coffee and chocolate rasberry brownies."
1,Mocks a great game,"Look, this game is sooo much funner without this guide...this guide only gives away things. Its not hard either so theres no reason to buy a guide for it"
1,Motor fried after an hour and a half of use...GARBAGE,"Used this product twice both times in 45 minute wash cycles and the motor fried, poorly designed back panel that easily allows water/condensation inside to open electronics, litterally was smoking after 2 45 minute washes...terrible product"
3,Nice Box Set,"This is a bit of an oddity, in that Scepter wasn't a ""Soul"" label or a ""Rock"" label, but a ""Pop"" label, which encompasses quite a few different genres. There's the smooth (The Dionne Warwick/Bacharach/David Canon is superbly represented here), the girl group sound (Shirelles), the rough (gospelled-up soul of Maxine Brown and Chuck Jackson), the garage (The Kingsmen) and the cheeze (BJ Thomas). Discs one and two are both stellar, but the chronologically-ordered set gradually goes to pot towards the end, with BJ (possibly the least coolest singer ever) blathering and crooning his way through some of the '70s worst pop sludge. Still, this set is worth it simply because the first two discs are quite good, and Maxine Brown's previously unreleased take on ""Baby Cakes"" on the third disc will simply blow you away. Get it cheap, or don't get it at all."
1,Boring,"This game is not fun. If you know the acronym it's asking for, it's too easy. If you don't know, you don't care. I have never played a more boring game (except maybe Ubi)."
3,"Cute Truck, Tweaks Needed","This is an adorable old time look & feel pedal truck. It was and still is a huge WOW! for my son who is 4 and obsessed with fire trucks. My biggest issue is that although the pedals can be adjusted as a child grows, if you adjust them, then they hit the front wheels and all ability to turn is negated. Also, we had an issue -- the fire helmet attachment wasn't manufactured correctly to hold the string & enable you to ring the bell --and Customer Service at the company was less than stellar to work with. I finally got the part -- free of charge due to defect -- and it broke after 4 weeks. This time we were able to fix it so it will work. Finally the ladders are precariously perched on the hooks...must be a better solution to hang them there. My son loves it. The bell has a pleasant sound, phew!, and the flashing light makes him so happy."
3,Poorly Written,"I am in this book - my name was misspelled (Deputy Tulley) - I was never a dark haired, well-built man as the book states - the book is fairly accurate."
3,"good for beginners, but you'll outgrow it","this dictionary is wonderful for the beginner, but will soon be outgrown by the serious student of Chinese. Though the characters are small, a little experience with characters will make it easy. This book is best used as a second reference used sparingly once you have got intermediate communication skills."
5,Quite nice.,"Bought for delicious homemade hamburger buns and it works quite well, especially for the price. No complaints!"
4,Love this muffin pan!,"I love this muffin top pan! It cleans up so easily and is nice and skinny to fit in any drawer or cupboard. The only downside to it is that it takes more muffin batter to fill the cup. So a batter that would normally make 12 regular muffins, would only make about 5 or 6 muffin tops. So, a suggestion would be to double your recipe. It takes a few batches to get it down, but I like them a lot better than regular muffins."
1,Race wrapped up in Confusion,"This book is subtitled ""A Philosophical Introduction"", leading one to believe that you wouldn't have to be a philosopher to understand what the man is saying. Blantant lie. The book was completely confusing and needlessly verbose. The author once used degrading in a sentence, and then defined ""degrade"" and how he meant it to be used in the next sentence. He eithers thinks his readers incredibly stupid, or just feels the need to throw out definitions every chapter. Surrounding the needless definitions are complex philosophical arguments that take hours to break down and understand, this book is not an introduction to anything. If you want to learn about race-thinking or the different arguments about the meaning of race, this is not the book for you."
5,Refreshing,"I love lots of different music: Classic Jazz, Classic Blues, Classic Country, Lots of Rock. Bobby Darin, Frank,Ella, Doris Day,Hank Sr.,Jimmy Rodgers,Jimmy Rogers,Jimmie Reed, Stones, Dylan, Beatles etc.Alex Pangman is just SUPERB!! Would love to see her perform in Maine!What a treasure!!Check out April Barrows and Janet Klein also."
5,great world jazz covers of Beatles songs!,"Night On Earth: Mike Levin (soprano, alto & tenor saxophones, flute, clarinet, bass clarinet), Bob Long (keyboards), Steve Hashimoto (bass), Brian Derek (fretless bass), Hamid Drake (tabla), Eliseo Diaz (percussion).Recorded at Lakeside Media Studios and Soundtracks Studios, Chicago, Illinois. Includes liner notes by Mark Stern.All songs written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney except ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" (George Harrison)."
2,Muzak meets the Beatles,"I was encouraged by the previous review to pop this CD in my player and give it a listen. I like world jazz, if its good. This stuff -- it'selevator music. Or sitting in the dentist's chair music. But it is NOT music you should go out of your way to buy."
5,My FAVORITE Album Since 1975!,"I bought BLUE JAYS on lp when it was released in '75. I LOVED IT from that day on. I thought I would go mad waiting for the CD. I cant say I love EVERY song (blue guitar being my least fav.), but, this is my FAVORITE album! I recommend this album to EVERYONE!!!"
2,Castle,Quality was terrible. The video was hard to watch. What kind of camera did they use?It was waste of money. Still love the castle series.
2,Broke very quickly.,"Worked quite well for about a month. Then silencer attachment got stuck on barrel, and when removing it broke barrel out from inside the gun. If purchased i would recommend not to ever put on the silencer. Otherwise good gun. However i am going to be buying a semi-auto vs. this single shot to replace it."
5,The Art of Political War and Other Radical Pursuits,This is another great book by David Horowitz. He explains how Americans with traditional values just can't seem to play the game of politics like the Left\Democratic Party. He takes the left to task with the hypocrisy of their beliefs!
1,A real Zero,"I must say this book was a dog. I've been reading some great books lately and was on a hot streak ... then came Year Zero. The book plodded. Many characters were given big build ups and then disappeared or were briefly mentioned. The plot was slow and I found myself barely finishing the book. This was not because I cared for any of the characters or the plot, I was hoping something good come along to redeem the novel. Alas and alack I was wrong. Avoid it like the plagure. (Pun intended)"
2,"No Cigar, No Respect","Mr. Long's novel hooks the reader with several intriguing story lines, most of which lead nowhere.My main problem though, is that while I am not a practising Christian, I find the use of the deeply-held religious sentiment of millions of people in a work of entertainment to be offensive. The author's characters casually toss off any possibility of religious truth.Like the 'DARWIN' fish which swims on bumpers, Mr. Long has used the symbols of belief to belittle the faithful."
3,Could have been much better,"On the positive side, there are some very engaging plot lines and vivid scenes in this book. the overall premise is interesting, and the characters are well drawn. The beginning during the world-wide crisis is very well done. however, this book could have been so much better. the author leaves many unanswered questions, not just unanswered, but explicitly ignored. Its as if he started some interesting plot lines, then didn't know where to go with them. Overall, a good book (3 1/2 stars leaning towards 3), but its slow in the middle and i wasn;t completely satisfied with the ending."
2,Dead end writing,"A great idea that went nowhere. I was looking for another ""The Stand"" but ended up with a book that has too many sub-plots. It was almost like the author wasn't quite sure which direction he wanted to go with this. Too bad, it started out stong and gave the impression it would be an interesting read."
5,excellent read,"an excellent read. it seems to be a well thought out storyline that was an unique experience. not as good as his 'Descent' book -- but very few books are! overall, everyone i know that has read this book really enjoyed it. i can't wait for his next one."
2,Not Science Fiction,"I am sorry but this book is no more Science Fiction than ""The Stand"". Unexplained details about the plague and the cloning leave a Science Fiction reader wanting. Also, the villain was contrived and the ending was vague and lacked closure. I cannot recommend this book."
4,Great Buy,"The skull heads were what I expected only bigger, and in my case that took them down a star. But other than that the service was great the speed of the shipment was on point. I'd definitely order from here again."
1,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed the amazing singing on American Idol, and hoped to see it again in this video. Unfortunately it mostly focuses on the process of choosing the Idol, and doesn't show many of the great singing moments. If you want to see some of those moments, you are better off buying the compilation video."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"I cannot express how disappointed I was. If you think you are going to see any of the great performances, such as Tamyra singing ""A Fool in Love"" or Kelly singing ""Stuff Like That There"" you are mistaken. They didn't show ANY of the big band performances. If you are a Kelly fan, it is a real waste of money because they don't show very many performances from her. You do get to see Christina captivate the audience with her rendition of ""Ain't No Sunshine"". That, along with Tamyra's ""A House is Not a Home"" are the only real highlights. Even Kelly's emotionally charged performance of ""A Moment Like This"" at the end does not save this DVD. It consisted mostly of behind the scenes which I was not interested in and a background of the judges, again nothing interesting. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Not highly impressed!,"I consider myself to be an avid fan of American Idol. I came across the first season by accident, when I was sitting at home on a Tuesday night, and happened to turn on the tv to FOX. Ryan Star was singing at the time. When I heard that they came out with a DVD on American Idol, I assumed that it would be the ENTIRE SEASON. I was mistaken! Out of the 10 top finalists, you only get to view 5 out of the 10 do at least one solo performance. Kelly and Justin do 3-4, Niki does 2, Tamyra does one, and Christina Richin does 1. The DVD did a lot of recaps and behind the scenes, but still it wasn't enough to be worth while. It's ovious that American Idol is a hit, and the producers should think highly of doing a COMPLETE SEASON set of BOTH the FIRST & SECOND season!!"
2,Good in light. Doesn't work in dark conditions,"Under lighted conditions, the fiber optic works reasonably well. If you are in a low light indoor condition, don't expect the sights to brightly glow. The serious disappointment is that the two ""tritium"" rear yellows barely glow in the dark making the TruGlo virtually impossible to see and thus line up with the green muzzle light. There is no way the extra feeble glow of tritium can be used in a defensive condition.I wrote to the company but have not heard back yet. I had high hopes but am disappointed with TruGlo.Update: Received email from TruGlo instructing me to return the sight to them for repair."
2,DOA Night Sights,"I ordered these sights and they were delivered very quickly. I took them to my gunsmith and had them installed. Come to find out, the front sight is not glowing at all and the back sights are about half as bright as other TruGlo TFO sights I have installed on other guns. Tritium glows for 5 to 12 years depending on the color and these sights might have been old. They are installed now and it's too late to send them back. They will still work well but just not in darkness."
4,Crazy Cat Lady Action Figure,"My wife and I have 6 cats and she oftens refers to herself as, ""The crazy cat lady of XXXX street,"" so when I saw it mentioned in The Des Moines Register, I had to have it. My wife thinks it's cute and funny.I'd call it an adult toy because of the subject matter and the six cats packed with it are fairly small.It's a great gift for the cat lover in one's life!"
5,Great gift and great for your own collection,Love the Cat Lady! She makes a GREAT gift too. If she had accessories I would get them too. Like a cat bowls and a cat box.I bought two Cat Lady sets as Christmas presents for deserving friends and they went over really well. They LOVED them!
1,Useless without 3D Home Architech,"The basis of landscape is to fit it to your house. Unfortunately, if you don't have 3D Home Architech already, you're hosed in having any chance of devolping anything useful that looks like your house. Buyer beware - you need the suite - and there's no warning that 3D Home Architect is needed. And once you've bought this software, you are destined to buy more outdated software to make it useable - so you might as well go for it all with the suite. It has been a long time since I have bought any Broderbund software, and it will be longer yet, as in never!"
1,Major Dissapointment.,"Simply put the home wizard is piece of junk unless your house is box. The plant database is somewhat useful. The objects are lacking, they should of included more textures and objects.Definitely returning this sucker."
1,"The Ring, The Grudge, The Woman in Black","How many times is the same plot going to be used over and over again?This is the same old story of a crazy woman spirit seeking revenge. The main character in these types of stories does some research, finds a body, and gives it a proper burial, only to have the spirit remain at unrest. Remind you of any other movies???The movie was very slow and featured things moving in front of the camera followed by a loud noise. No chances taken and very few interesting story elements make this movie run-of-the mill. The settings were amazing, but don't seem to be fully utilized to make this a really thought-provoking film.Overall, it's just the same thing we've seen before and offers nothing new or exciting. What a let down."
1,Trully disappointing,"I really expected more from this movie as a Radcliffe fan and after watching the trailer. Sadly the trailer was the only thing that I ended up liking about this awful film. At the theater, as the movie tried to progess, I realized that it would never going to get any good. All my friends felt the same disappointment at the end of the screening. Trust me and do not waste your precious time and money with this garbage or you will be as disappointed as me."
2,Under-Use of a Promising Young Talent,"I purchased this item from Amazon. Reviewer Linda Pagliuco says it very well. Yes, there is the creepy house -- very well done -- excellent lighting, or rather, non-lighting. The Gothic theme played to the hilt. But it seems like there is very little acting for Daniel Radcliffe to actually do. Yes, his Arthur character is brave to the point of being foolhardy. And Radcliffe plays the part well. But there doesn't seem to be much to it. I bought it mainly to see him, but I also wish to give credit to the other actors. Ciaren Hinds especially is very sympathetic and I like the job he did. But I still was underwhelmed with the story as a whole. Finally, I was dissatisfied with the ending -- too awful in some ways, too ""Hollywood"" in others."
3,"To much of this, too little of that.","It's a shame that this atmospheric retelling of Susan Hill's superb novel is so bloodless. Both an earlier British TV film and the long-running London stage version outclass it in sheer chills. Less is always more in a ghost story, but in this THE WOMAN IN BLACK the reasoning seems to be ""If one wind-up Victorian toy is scary, seventeen of them will be terrifying!"" With apologies, no, it doesn't work that way. The central set-piece, Arthur's aural ""witnessing"" of a long-ago fatal carriage accident in the dangerous, all-encompassing and impenetrable mist of Eel Marsh is rushed through, but there is seemingly endless footage of a game but green Daniel Radcliffe wandering around the haunted mansion. The movie is way out of proportion, and the ending (SPOILER) seems to want to have it both ways, both gloom and happiness. Buy it for the superb production values and the sterling supporting cast, but this version of THE WOMAN IN BLACK will not haunt your dreams."
3,Woman in black NV,"Excited to see Daniel Radcliffe moving forward in his career. Fine actor, makes any role believable even a creepy one. Creepy not in a in your face way but subtle, low key way.Movie is bit sluggish but flows coherently to a surprising conclusion. Be prepared to be sad and happy at the same time. A good but not great movie for a couple of hours."
2,Lacks character,"I liked this movie but the ending ruined it. Minor spoilers ahead. Although the sets were fantastic and the watery setting was very nice, all the people in the film lack character. Oh, sure you learn about their pasts, but no one develops or changes much.This is especially true for the movie's main villain. It's just an evil thing. Sure it has motivation, but there's no chance for redemption or resolution. The first 90% is good spooky entertainment. The last bit is high budget indie laziness disguised as high concept. It's more a record of events than a story."
3,Not bad.,"Spooky stuff. I love stories about vengeful ghosts, and this one is a doozy. It seems a bit slow in places, however, and though I'm a fan of Daniel Radcliffe, he does seem too young for the part."
5,good playback,"amazon did the right thing and it played smoothly at good level or quality, not as scary as i'd hoped but then again i eat very hot peppers"
2,Could have been over in 30 minutes....,"I have looked forward to seeing this movie since I first saw previews when it was in the theater and I REALLY wanted and expected to like it. But I was sorely disappointed. About 30 minutes into it, I was wondering WHEN in the heck it was going to end. It was one of the most boring movies I've seen in quite a while and the entire story could have been told in a 15 minute short film. The atmosphere was creepy as was the old mansion....that's about it...."
2,I hate a bad ending - spoiler galore!,"Right in the middle of watching this movie on TV I was loving it so much (for I love classic gothic ghost stories without all the gore) I felt compelled to see if I could purchase it here. I almost purchased it before finishing watching it and I am now glad that I waited, for I hate bad endings. Who cares if he and his son were reunited with his dead wife in the afterlife, after being killed by the woman in black?! They were still killed and the ghost goes on, free to kill again and again. For me, catharsis is very important in watching a movie, and I never experience catharsis, with a bad ending, when the hero gets killed. This move was excellently made and delightfully scary, but I will never want to watch it again, and especially will not want to own it because of the let down of the bad ending."
2,Boring,I found this movie to be odd and very disappointing. Not scary at all and the story was just plain.
3,"Ok, but a really stupid ending","Probably would have given this one four stars for a suspenseful film if not for the really stupid ending. Without giving much away, ""they all died happily ever after"". It's Ok, but don't expect too much."
3,Dark Movie,Was dissapointed in this movie. It is depressing and not really scary. Thought I would give it a try. I liked some of his other movies better.
5,Outstanding,On the level of the old Hitchcock nail biters. Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job of keeping you on your seat (and out of your seat) the entire film. Wonderful suspense without all the blood and gore. Really makes your mind work which makes the movie even better.
3,Worth watching,"This movie was pretty good, but not fantastic. There are a few startling moments, but the storyline is a tad predictable. If you like Daniel Radcliffe you should watch it..."
2,disappointing,"I was expecting quite a lot from the trailer and it being Daniel Radcliffe. It was interesting enough, but not as thrilling as I thought it would be."
4,Decently scary without all the gore,"While there were definitely deaths, there wasn't all of the gore you see in most so called horror movies these days. I have to say there were a couple of scenes where everyone in the theater jumped. Very suspenseful and well done, if not as close to the book as I would have liked.I was pleasantly surprised that Daniel Radcliffe was able to carry a large percentage of the movie essentially by himself.Well done and very enjoyable."
4,Talk about a long delayed sequel,"Johnny Jenkins is a blues/soul singer from Macon Ga area. He did a classic album in early 1970's called Ton Ton Macoute. That album originally started as a Duane Allman solo project that was dropped. Jenkins came in and laid vocals and some guitar over the Duane Allman guitar arrangements. So he had one of the all time great guitar players as his bandleader, in effect and that was a very good album.2 1/2 decades later comes the followup. Duane, of course, is long gone but Gregg is still around as are other members of the Allman Brothers Band and they give a lot of back-up help on this one. Jenkins does a soul/blues blend and his work by himself is good- 3 stars and when he gets the Allmans support, it is very good - 4 1/2 stars. Fans of Southern blues like ZZ Hill and of course fans of the Allman Brothers will enjoy this."
5,A gripping read...,"I bought this at Borders (sorry Amazon) but loved every page. This is a book everyone should read, and for the stout of heart, give as a Christmas, Hannukka, Kwanzaa, etc. gift!"
4,Top crime fiction,"I enjoyed the book a lot. The author was able to write about what he knew and it told throughout the novel.Bunker has the ability to take any glamour out of the story and bring the gritty realism that one needs to read about. This is no fluff piece about the excitement of being a criminal.I would say that the novel fell away as it proceeded after the robbery that went sour. I think it was at this point that the author started writing fiction rather than personal experiences.Bearing that in mind, this is still an important piece of litertature and highly recommended."
4,Yummy,This is a great tasting cake. It comes w a rum sauce that you pour over the cake. The cake is moist and sweet but not overly sweet. The sauce is full of rum. Nice product!
3,"Excellent book for what it is, and very helping insight on Chopin's playing, but...","These pieces and fingerings are very accurate as to Chopin's own fingering. It even contains a foreword written by Carl Mikuli, one of Chopin's students, and later his teaching assistant, so he was in a position to know certain things about Chopin's playing and ability that perhaps few actually witnessed. He gives very valuable insight into Chopin's own ability, skills, and how he played his pieces.The music is rather large, and thus very readable.However, the binding is...well, I tried everything I could to find a spiral binding for this book and could not. I honestly feel that all piano music should come in spiral-bound books because of the frustration inevitably involved with any music print in books other than spiral-bound. But, that is my only complaint, and thus not just specific to this book, but all non-spiral-bound music books."
2,This is a battery eater,"Bought the kd-220z at Frys for $120 with a $20 rebate and tried it for about 15 photos until the two new alkaline batteries wentdead. When I opened the package there was an insert from the factory which recommended use of a lithium CRV3 battery which came with the camera, even though the camera is touted as working with 2 alkaline batteries. The camera worked ok and the pictures were of good quality, though it took a second or two or three to actually take a picture after pressing the button. The menues and operation were effective but crude and slow - have to keep turning the display button on and off when switching from display to shoot. I returned it because it took so few photos with the alkaline batteries. I get the feeling the factory knew of this shortcoming and now includes the more expensive (to replace) lithium package. But then the cost is only $100."
4,Easy Redi Ref for pocket,for Process Serving it is just the right pocket guide to carry with you. Its small enough and informative so you don't have to carry anything larger for Process Serving.
5,Keeps it HOT!,I bought this my my hubby who likes his coffee to stay hot. This cup does the trick and he does not have to throw out a half a cup of coffee because it got to cool. He likes the large size. I think I will order another for myself!
2,not impressed,"The mug does keep your coffee hot for a long time, but there is a weird rubber seal on the inside of the top ring that gets a build-up of old coffee and creamer. I lifted the seal with a fork and some gross old creamer came out. gross."
1,LEAKS unless you hold it completely upright at all times.,"It is not leak proof. It leaks, by design, unless you hold it 100% upright at all times. Heck, normal glass without a lid is as good as this. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WANT A TRAVEL MUG. Otherwise, good as an expensive stand alone mug which kinda keeps your drink warm (when it's not spilling all over you)."
2,"Now, not pleased-","At first I was pleased but now find the rubber piece on the bottom of two of mine have separated from the stainless base!!! I took some high-powered glue and re-attached them but now I am buying the Nissan 18 ounce stainless ""hydration"" mug because there is no rubber base-ring at the bottom to separate, just to warn people this happened after having these for a few months. Otherwise keeps things warm or cold for a long time."
2,Leaks as if its wide open,"Delivery was prompt, arrived 3 days earlier than expected. But it was delivered to the upstairs apartment, (mine was in a basement with separate entrance). The bottle keeps my coffee and tea hot for at least 4 hours. This is great. But the lid is clearly leaking and not suitable for being kept in a backpack."
5,Great Thermos,My wife had one for years and then left it somewhere. This replacement is just as fabulous. It keeps coffee hot for hours.
1,DON'T BUY! Terrible Leaky Top!,The top doesn't really close. Even when screwed shut and clicked shut there is a gap so my tea leaks every time I get in and out of the car. I'm not even talking about leaving it horizontal. Slightly tilt your full tumbler and you will get wet. Works for the desk but that's it. I would return it but I don't have the original packaging any more. C'est la vie.
4,Nearly perfect.,"I got my travel tumbler at the same time I purchased a thermos for my SO. The only complaint I could possibly have is that there is a small hole on the bottom of the tumbler (in the rubber non-skid foot bit) that can retain water and then release it at an inapprpriate moment. It doesn't really leak or drip (this hole), but when I sat it on my desk, I kept wondering where the water ring was coming from.That having been said, the only other suggestion I could have is that the snapping lid (that makes it spill-proof, but not drip-proof) fit more snugly. Other than these two relatively minor issues, it's a great tumbler. It keeps my coffee hot (I haven't tried out cold on it,yet), cleans easily and looks great. It gets jostled quit a bit during my morning commute, but doesn't spill (it hasn't been knocked to the floorboards, yet, traffic isn't that rough.)Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a high-quality travel cup that keeps things hot for quite some time, this is your best bet."
2,It was a gift,"It was a gift and someone who received it mentioned that this thermos doesn't store hot water for more than 2 hours. In the promo it is mentioned that it has the capacity of storing water throughout 24 hours. My expectations were not met, but I have not checked it myself - the feedback was given by a person that I handed it over to."
4,Great product,I was looking for a device to allow me to watch mpeg's on my tv. It also allows you to view photo collections and music stored on your pc to be played via your hi fi. It has optical out which is great and the quality of sound when streaming mp3's is great. It has a software component which installs on your PC which acts as a server to the device. I'm still getting used to the software and I have a few questions for their support people about how it works. Note if you have norton firewall you may need to disable it. it looks just like a hifi component which is good too
2,Not what I expected,Kettle roasted is not what these are. I thought them might be like the extra crisp peanuts sold under Planters Kettle Roasted. Not so. They are just regular peanuts - nothing special. Planters Kettle Roasted is far superior.
4,BEWARE if you're planning to use this with the Bench Dog table,"I just got my Wonder Fence today for my Bench Dog cast iron router table - the clamps for securing the Wonder Fence to the edges of the router table are too small! If they were just 1/16-1/8"" larger, they would slip on and be useable. Otherwise, the fence seems pretty solid."
5,So pretty... So addictive.,"I'm not much of an MMO player, but LOTRO's newbie experience was very user-friendly. The game is gorgeous, the quests are quirky and interesting, and I'm glad I'm playing it."
5,Archos PMA 430 -- outstanding mobile device.,"After using the Archos PMA 430 for a few weeks now I am still excited to use it daily. It must be the new toy affect. The video/audio playback are tremendous. The transferring of files and ease of use with the product is what I love about it. And the TV playback and recording are great.The only drawbacks are the basic interface design and the PDA functions are functional but not outstanding compared to other traditional PDA's. And the device does freeze from time-to-time if it is overed but not much different from other PDA devices.Overall, it's the best portable device I have used and the overall value is tremendous."
4,A fresh look at noir,"I enjoyed Chicago Noir quite a bit. Its broad array of authors offer a refreshing take on the well-worn noir genre. While there's still plenty of moral ambiguities, cliffhanger plot twists and sudden acts of senseless violence to please the most devoted fans of traditional noir, the writers come up with some interesting new angles. A very enjoyable effort overall."
1,Blah,This did absolutely nothing. I took it twice a day just before I would normally get snack cravings and I still got the snack cravings. These pills are a joke.
3,Pure Class,"Well what can I say about this DVD. Well when I first saw it I thought this does not look like the best thing since sliced bread, which we all know realy was the internet, but after buying all the DVD's in my local shops limited range I was forced to buy this oneand what can I say it was pure class the charectors were realy brought to life and I felt as if I wanted to be there with them but I think that is more to do with my mental health that the DVD. I would recomend this to anyone who has a DVD player as it is one of the best I have seen. This will one day become a classic and if you don't get it know you might not be able to get it then so don't delay buy today."
5,Best College Band Ever,"Peg Head is one of the best albums ever, but, it doesn't give people the sense of what Black Happy is unless you have heard them live. They gave a great show and never sold out to the Man. They never had a problem playing at any of our Fraternity parties, and give props to all the Cougs who enjoyed their music"
4,judas strike,"LIKE ALL OF THE DEATH LANDS YOU HAVE GOOD ONE AND BAD ,THIS IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWENE, NOT LIKE THE OLD DEATH LANDS WHEN THE GREATE JAMES AXLER WAS HERE,THIS ONE AGAIN WAS MISSING A LOT OF WHAT DEATH LANDS IS .DEATH LANDS IS IN MY BLOOD SO GOOD OR BAD I HAVE TO HAVE IT.WHERE IS THE REAL JAMES AXLER?BRING HIM BACK DEATH LANDS NEEDS HIM ALONG WITH RYAN TO SAVE IT .THANK"
2,Weak link in an amazing discography,"If you are testing the WSP waters, why not swim over to ""Space Wrangler"" or ""Light Fuse Get Away"". Any other albums from the Boys would be a better starting point than here."
4,All Aboard,"Anyone not on this Panic train better get on...double time it actually. Houser is gone, RIP, but they are still KICKING it hard and innovationg like you would not believe. SO if you have ""heard"" or ""wondered"" if they are worth your 15 bucks for a cd, the answer is YES. I am listening to ""Jack"" right now while writing this and I want to get on the tail end of there tour right now. Forget the ""jam band"" hype, this is rock n roll that will change your life. Long live The Roadhouse in Athens, GA."
