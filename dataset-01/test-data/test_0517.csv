4,Fabulous Historical Fiction!,"I wish I could rate this at 4.5 stars instead of 4. The 1/2 star would be just because of the annoying formatting issues in the e-book. I'll admit I really was not expecting this book to be as masterfully crafted as it is. And since it is so very long, I thought surely it must be boring in parts. But is is absolutely not boring anywhere! I was engaged until the very end. The e-book does have some typos and formatting issues, but not enough to distract from the story. I myself am really not fond of graphic sex, so I did completely skip a few spots, but the story stands just fine without them. It's great to read something for fun and get a bit of a history lesson as a bonus!"
2,Better Categorized as Historical Romance Novel,"I am an avid historical fiction reader and was intrigued by the novel's concept. However, I was disappointed when the book turned into more of a romance novel than I cared for. Concept was excellent, writing was good."
2,It certainly could do with the 'nearly everything' part,"The book is readable, but it just really skims the surface of some important topics. A far better use of someone's time would be to read 'the secret history of the world' by Laura Knight-Jadczyk. But of course it depends on whether the reader actually wants to know more about the true nature of mankinds current predicament and how we got here, or is quite happy wasting a few hours with some mindless tripe."
4,Fun and informative,"I love reading Bill Bryson. I have this on my Droid phone and it is a great book for reading snippets while waiting in doctor's offices, etc. He gives an historical perspective to scientific discoveries with insight into those who made the discoveries. It is a real jewel of nonfiction."
3,Not quite of everything but a decent read,"I gifted this to someone and then went and read it at the library... and I kinda regreted gifting it... I think the author did his research well.. but I also think he focusses a lot more on certain areas while leaving out several others untouched.What I liked most was his research and mention of people (inventors, discoverers, archaelogists) that had major contributions to what we know about the world today, but never actually hear about the names of those people... simply because they weren't popularized as much as the Einteins and the Newtons of the time."
5,Bryson can write.,"As a person who has had plenty of science and medical coursework, I would recommend this book to anyone with or without prior knowledge of these subjects. Bryson brings color and common sense to the most abstract and dry subject, which is the entire history of science. Why didn't our other teachers ever tell us these interesting facts about the great scientists of the world? He is also able to put all of the most extreme ideas into practical and understandable language, mostly with his use of context and comparison. This is a very entertaining book, and one of the most usefully educational you will ever read."
3,"Comprehensive, far from Everything","A good, quick read with lots of intersting items. However, my view of what should have been covered in this book differs significantly from that of the author's view. Let's face it, we all have our own parochial interests, and unless you are on the author's same wavelength, you are likely to be less than satisfied."
2,Out of his league,"Bryson is clearly out of his league with this book. Agonizingly tedious. No depth, no insights. Will soon be at every church book sale."
5,Excellent,I am a high school science teacher and have been using this book to give our students an overview of many areas of science. They love it. And it really gives them a good background for more in depth reading. Highly recommended.
4,"Good book, but must be read with some caution","At first I was compelled to give five stars for this book. I even thought about writing a review before even reaching the middle of it. I was really amazed by the author's writing style, effort on research and easiness to read. By the time I got to the end, I was still thinking the book was great - but not so great than I thought in the middle.I'm a physicist, so I have some knowledge in a few areas that most people don't. I've found some inaccuracies in this book that could've been solved with some more research. Sometimes the urge the author has to be funny clouds the science he is trying to explain. Don't take all the info inside the book as literal truth. Some of them, at least in my area of expertise, aren't which led me to question the accuracy of other that I know nothing of, like geology and history.It's a good book, but it's better if you search for yourself the things the author claims to be true."
3,No Science Book,"I like the premise of the book, and indeed Bryson is a wonderful author. Great historical information, and I really like the information that he presents and the biographical information is great. This is no science book though. The way in which the ideas are presented makes them sound as though the results are conclusive. I am a scientist, and I am a creationist, maybe some don't think that these things go together - but they sure do! The ideas that Bryson presents are entirely evolutionary and he speaks of them conclusively - there's no space for that - we weren't there, and don't know for sure. It seems to me that we can make no conclusions of what happened before our recorded history. We only know that we live in an EXTREMELY COMPLEX world with a seemingly mysterious past."
2,A Short History of Nearly Everything You Didn't Want To Know,"Bill Bryson is the quintessintial American writer and pretty much he touches, turns to Gold. But not on this book. I felt as if he spent more time providing a history of *individuals* responsible for the discovery of different things throughout history. Where they were born, what they ate, who they talked to, and what they worked on. Interesting to some, but not to me.What's worse, is that I really didn't learn anything about History! Probably becaue I didn't finish the book...."
1,Painfully boring.,"Wow. If this CD won't put you to sleep, then you have issues. What a boring and dull CD. I, unfortunately, didn't realize that the author would start at the very, very beginning of time.. right down to atoms and protons. When the author claimed ""how we went from there being nothing at all to there being something, and then how a little of that something turned into us, and also what happened in between and since"", I was interested. But the CD just dragged on and on. I guess if you're into science, you'd enjoy it but I'll pass on this one."
5,Great read.,Very interesting read. Incredibly dense; it's packed with information. I think I'll be working on this book for a while.
5,Creative and eye-opening,"Bill Bryson has the ability to take textbook subject matter and make it far more entertaining than anyone else. His creative perspective fosters an enthusiastic following and I will be sure to continue reading all of his works. If you like science and are interested in the big-picture, this is definitely the book for you."
5,Brings life to science.,"As a chemistry teacher, this book ranks up there with ""Our Demon Haunted World"" by Sagan as the most important book I've read. Bryson fills in the missing spaces of our bland textbook education and make scientists seem human."
4,Everything Explained,"From subatomic particles to tectonic plates to Pluto and then back again; Bryson covers it all. His goal is to help you and me understand (like the title says:) Nearly Everything. Every major science and the eccentric characters who built them are presented in a smooth and often hilarious tone. Bryson somehow makes reading about sediment a thrill. The first three-quarters of A Short History were highly entertaining, likely because Bryson dedicates as much time to the oddball scientists and their antics as to the science itself. In the latter chapters, the reading turns heavier, but that might be because there weren't so many colorful characters to focus on. That's not to say any part of the book was anything less than enlightening. A Short History shouldn't be missed."
4,Good Attempt,"The truth is I had never before read a book from Bill Bryson, though I have to say he made a good attempt telling the story of Natural Science. The thing is Bryson is no scientist and to make matters worse I'm pretty sure he didn't knew much about the subject before he decided to give it a try. The book is a pleasant reading since the author's style is coloquial and fluid. Also, it seems he made an extensive research to backup his writing, and that too is a book plus. Basically the four stars reflect my opinion on the way the story is told (not the style, but the order of things and the lack of connection between Bryson's history) and on the lack of clear and deep scientific explanations bounded to history."
1,Woefully boring,"I was looking for something with a humorous twist to it, sort of ""the story behind the story"" but this wasn't it. Bryson did, in fact, do his homework and research in gathering facts, but the book read like a boring high school science/physics text book. As I tried to get ""into"" this book, it became more boring as each page was turned. What could have been said in a few sentences took several pages. I don't know how others feel, but David Bodanis did what Bryson failed to do in the excellent ""Electric Universe,"" and ""E=MC2."" If you're looking for the story behind the story and understanding the chain of events that got us to where we are, Bodanis would be the way to go."
5,A must read!,"I first read A Short History while on business in Australia. I couldn't put it down. The writing is outstanding and the information is communicated in language that anyone can understand. I have been re-reading A Short History with my kids, and they love it. This is a book for all ages."
4,Great book,"It's a great glimpse into the history of sciences, showing the more human side of things. Anybody can understand it with a little bit of work, though if you are confident in your high school math/science abilities you will understand everything he says with out any extra effort on your part."
3,Entertaining,"The book was an entertaining read. It briefly touches on just about every subject. The only real thing that isn't that great is that it will go through several historical figures very quickly leaving you with a lot of information to digest. Later, the author often returns to talk about that figure, but after you've already forgotten about him. Not a big deal though.Also, I thought the book would be more focused around history but it is actually more focused around the history of science."
3,"a very good read, full of rambling knowledges and fascinating locations and facts","This is a funny collection of history and science as we know it through Bill Bryson's eyes. It's full of ramblings that are rather comical at times and sleepy at others but a nice read altogether as the author visits history, historical people, the progression of knowledge and our understanding of it today. The book is literally about a small piece of history of every aspect of the universe as we know it. Well put together and not a simple quick reading."
3,Not quite what I expected,"My only disappointment with this book is that I expected more science facts and less history, but it's pretty much all history. Yes, it's a good readable story of many scientific discoveries, but if you're interested in satisfying your scientific curiosity, then this probably is not what you want.Though if you do buy it, definitely get the illustrated edition! I enjoyed being able to see what all the scientists I was reading about actually looked like."
3,too many anecdtoes,"This is a pretty good book. However, I was very disappointed by the fact that the author has more to say about the personalities of famous scientists than about science. The book has way too many anecdotes."
2,"Not About Science, Rather About Personal Drama of Scientists","This book is not about science. It is about the personal baby mama drama of scientists. Few to no words are actually devoted to explaining discoveries, and when Bryson does talk about actual science he often gets it wrong or gives bad emphases. For every word on actual science he spends 10 words talking about feuds, marriages, business ventures, and basically on trying to be funny.The book does not live up to its title or its jacket. This is a softball, lazy way to talk about the history of science that has already been done countless times before precisely because it is so easy to do. Most if not all of his material is derivative and can be found in other, better books that came before him.Thoroughly disappointing, I won't be wasting my energy reading anything from Bill Bryson ever again.Bottom line: This is not science, this is relationship drama."
4,Did you ever wanna know a little something about everything?,Well then this book is for you. For once a author comes close to his claim in the title. This book actually does contain a little of everything. From the big bang to the orgins of life and atoms and cells. This book makes it easy for the average reader to put together subjects they may have once thought of as out of there scope of knowledge. I give the author credit for bringing a piece of literature to the average person that explains tough theory. Everyone should have some basic idea about the things that effect our lives our earth and our universe. Good read!
3,Fun but questionable...,"I'm about 1/2-way through the book and I've found it to be very entertaining so far. However, I had wanted to use this as a reference (I teach science at a community college) and I have found two really stupid errors so far that any decent science editor should have corrected.1. Loss of the Saturn V booster plans during a NASA reorganization. No. They still have them. The problem is how to build the dang things since you need 60's-era parts. Who's gonna make 'em?2. Glass flows and all you have to do is look at old cathedral glass to prove it (it's thicker at the bottom). This one I hate because I was taught it. You know why cathedral glass is thicker at the bottom? Here's a hint- only 1/2 will be thicker at the bottom. The other 1/2 will be thicker at the top. That's how the stuff was made! We have better manufacturing processes, now.This makes me ask- ""what else?""I would question the use of this as a reference unless you are very careful about verification."
5,"The only book I have ever read twice, back to back","Bill Bryson's A short History of Nearly Everything rates as nearly the best book I have ever read. He takes complex subjects and renders them readable, understandable and highly entertaining. While I am an avid reader, I learned more from this book than I have from nearly anything else. A must read!"
1,"A Waste of Money, Time and Materials","I got a copy of this book for Christmas. It does not deserve even 1 star. I tried to read it from the beginning but it was so bad I tried to find a chapter by skipping ahead to find something that would be interesting or entertaining or something other than boring. Alas it was not to be. This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read and I am including school textbooks. Save your money and either go to a museum, planetarium or watch PBS. I believe that you will be more likely to stay awake. I find it interesting that if you try to browse throught the sample pages at Amazon.com all you see are the cover notes, table of contents and the index. If this was any good I would think that a legitimate sample of the actual writing (if you can call it that) would be included."
1,Not long enough for taller people. Does not secure to door.,"I don't recommend this if you are over 5'6"", as the rope is not long enough. Also, it does not secure tightly to a door knob."
2,door knob exerciser,"This is not the best quality I have seen, nor is it the easiest to attach to any door knob that is not the round type. The leads are extremely short making it hard to work with for anyone that is over 5'7"". I would not purchase again."
2,EGR WindowVisor,"It looks good and it's easy to install but mine keeps falling off every time I lower my driver side window, it was good for the first few days but now it expends more time on my passenger sit than the door."
4,More than met my low expectations.....,"More than met my low expectations for this parody of latest raunchy comedies.If you enjoyed the movies in the title, then chances are you will get a laugh or two out of watching thisraunchy parody remix that tries to go even more of over the top than the originals."
1,less than 1 star,"No good if it doesn't work & mine does not. I bought this becuase it looked like the best made / most industrial one in the store. I like the simple control, but agree with the other review; too few temps. My real gripe is that I can only fry one basket (avg 3 min) before the thing overheats and has to be shut off and cooled down before use. Worthless when trying to cook more than 1-2 servings. Also returning and will try the Oster if the store has it."
5,Kids can't get enough of Blue,"My girl's (11m, 2 1/2 years, 4 years) love Blue and would watch it from sun up to sun down if I let them. I really love the puppet episodes. I had to give them both a sock for their toy chest to play with at will after watching the sock puppet episode. Blue's Clues is by far the best children's show we have found. It is just good, clean educational fun without an agenda attached. The characters are all cute and likable, and they all have a lot of rewatchability, even for parents."
1,I'm Phoebe Cates fan but I can't stand this awful movie,"I've seen EVERY film that has her name on credit and I can say this is the worst(if not silly Private School). Okay,if all you want is to see her naked body,you'll get what you want.Plus,it's her debut,she was 17 then, so you can see young and innocent Phoebe.It's not enough to make this movie worth watching,though.Get ""Princess Caraboo"" and ""Bodies,Rest,and Motion"" if you're her REAL fan.The reason these two excellent movies exist in the world is to glorify her true talent."
1,Don't even think about watching it!!,This movie is like Blue Lagoon in every way but 10 times worse!
2,"Full movie, uncut but parts censored, and terrible quality.","I have bought an old move before, and the quality was decent. however, this is my second time. and this was not worth it.the story is alright, but the quality is terrible. some of the video is in good quality, but pretty much all the full nude shots are really pixely and grainy. i couldn't finish it with the such terrible quality.it's uncut, but the uncut scenes are censored...if you want to get this for the nudity, it's not worth it.the quality for the cut version may be better, but i'm not spending more money to figure out if it is."
3,Poor Quality recording,"Cheap copy, Quality of dvd, Appears to have been burned to a dvd from a vcr tape, The picture is grainy and the sound quality is poor, But i am glad i purchased this movie, I had not seen this movie since the mid 80's! Hard to believe this movie is 30 years old this year..WOW"
4,Innocence that ought to be in more movies,"I did not think the movie was silly, but it displayed an innocence that was refreshing. The two are obviously committed to each other as both are wearing ""wedding rings"" by the end of the movie. Too many movies today glorify adultry and all other sexual perversions. Aames even apologizes to God for one curse word he utters. We need more movies without cursing, adultry and other perversions."
2,McEwan's Descent Into Porn,"Like other reviewers, I marvel at the genius (a term I rarely use) of Mr. McEwan, in works such as ""Atonement,"" ""Amsterdam,"" and ""Saturday."" I believe that he is the finest writer of fiction living today. However ""First Love, Last Rites,"" written albeit very early in his career, while offering us snippets of dark humor and polished prose, are for the most part one-dimensional tales of sexual rites of passage. And bizarre rites they are! One is exposed to incest, child abuse and other peculiar tales from a writer who was obviously groping his way onto the literary landscape. Concentrate on his later works and forget this compilation. He is so much better than these stories."
1,Ellington has to be spinning in his grave!,The spirit of the great Duke Ellington must be listening to this self indulgent tripe and wondering three things: 1. Who told Wynton he could liberally borrow huge portions of my work and put his name on it? 2. Who told Wynton he could rearrange my notes like that? 3. Who said he could have MY Pulizer?
4,Beautiful,Daytimer always delivers the best scheduling products on the market. I bought this one wanting something smaller than my previous 8 1/2 X 11 organizer and elegant enough that I would be proud to carry it into meetings. The only reason I am only giving it 4 stars is that there aren't many options for the scheduler refills that go inside.
1,Wrong picture,"Item arrived today and it looks very dark Brown - almost Black. There is a huge difference between Tan, Dark Tan, and Dark Brown/Black.I'm attempting to get back into my old habits of using Franklin Covey planner.The item is genuine Franklin Covey but I expected my item to look like the picture and not almost black.1 star for poor representation of the product!!!"
1,This mascara..,"Its horrible. I would constantly get eye infections and it itches like crazy. Doesn't really do much for the eyelashes except darken them a bit. I accidently spilled it on my countertop and it's been there for a year now. I've tried nail polish remover, bleach paste, detergent and it absolutely won't come up. WHY would you want to put this on your eyelashes??"
4,Decent novel,"As other have noted, some of the motivations of the characters are a little odd. However, if you aren't looking for great literature, but just a solid read, this was a pretty good story. The author builds suspense nicely. I am glad I read it."
1,The Virgin of Small Plains,"I expected so much more with the complimentary reviews printed all over the book, but it was a huge disappointment. Our bookclub read it and each one of us had the same reaction--a waste of time and money. Poorly written with typos and redundancy--it was so predictable. The plot had distinct possibilities and in the hands of an Elizabeth George or Barbara Kingsolver could have been a tremendously interesting adventure but Nancy Pickard's writing fell far short of the mark. Our discusssion in bookclub regarding this book was mostly about how such an inferior piece of writing could get such great reviews and two book awards, we're mystified..."
2,"Flimsy, two-dimensional","I was such a huge fan of Nancy Pickard's Jenny Cain mysteries -- held them up as how a series should be done. Was delighted to find Nancy had written this new book, but it pales in comparison to any of her Jenny Cain mysteries. The storyline is very thin, the characters are underdeveloped. It felt like reading a bad TV movie. Hurts me to say this cuz I have been a fan of Nancy's other books, but this really felt beneath her level of writing ability."
5,Brain-based Learning Supported by Brain-based Teaching,"Mindshift provides a research-based model of teaching and learning based on the neuroscience of how the brain works. The authors recognize that this model is a departure from traditional methods of teaching and present strategies for professional development and activities to facilitate this transition for educators. While the book is intended for K12 educators, the ideas are also very pertinent to higher education as well."
3,fur real smoochie puppy,"Though my daughter loves her puppy- she loves everything furry, and cute, I expected more from the toy. It offers little more than just being stuffed."
3,"For my wife, for christmas.","I came too late, I paid the extra to get here and it didn't get here with the expectations of being on time. 10 days should have been 3 to 4 days. The book is Ok, I wanted nothing to do with it, my wife loved it."
5,Compelling Reading,"Compelling reading, albeit it quite unpleasant at times. If you're squeamish, be warned.Parry paints vivid vignettes from various bloody moments in Indonesia's recent history, wearing his heart on his sleeve. This is not a sober, detached analysis of events - it is a first hand account of what these moments looked like on the ground.Unique and invaluable, and well-written."
5,good book,"this book has a spiral binder, so the pages stay flat !!tough puzzles too... slightly larger size pages and quality paper make this a winner."
3,These books vary widely.,"The first NYT Sunday puzzle book I ordered was great. But have gotten two since, and this one is the most disappointing: Some of the puzzle clues are so tiny you'd need a magnifying glass. And, like the first book I got, these puzzles have no lead-in introductions giving you clues about solving so you have to look in the back if the puzzle isn't making sense."
4,Perfect,We wait all week for the Sunday puzzle and see who can get to it first. Now we don't have to fight over it
1,My perspective of the book,"The assignment are interesting, but the answer keys part needs revising since you don't provide your rationale for the answers choices you picked up. And the learning happens at that level, I mean in explaining WHY you choose a particular answer you are helping the student learn all the grammar points in the sentence. So I sincerely think there is no learning in the book, it is very mechanical, providing only the letter answers.Also, the book is not that organized, there are many details that should be taken out. It is confusing and the CD listening section is not organized either.It should be organized according to the listening section in the book"
5,Lenman,"If you are a Coltrane fan.. this is must for your collection, if you are a Jazz fan, this is a must for your collection, if you are a music lover, this is a must for your collection. This Coltrane work is truly one of his finest pieces of work. The blending of the foreground and background are in excellent balance. The music is just incredible .. not overpowering and definitely will get heavy rotation on your system. Simply a beautiful classic masterpiece that stands the test of time."
4,If you're gonna have just one...,"This is the one to have. This CD has all the hits you'd expect to find on a Living Colour compilation, and not too much filler. 'Cult of Personality' and 'Open Letter to a Landlord' sound as good as the day you first heard them. Even though 'Type' and 'Nothingness' never were smash hits, they're two of my favorite songs by the band. Clocking in at nearly 76 minutes, and with 17 tracks, it's a fair bet that you'll find something you like on this album."
4,dog lovers,My husband read this book over and over as a child and now we are reading the book as a family. It is a sweet tale about a dog who has his ears and tail chopped off by a dog abuser. He ends up with a lovely family who takes good care of This is a very good book for boys to learn how to treat and how not to treat a dog.We are currently reading the book and are enjoying his adventures.
4,great pictures,This book has great pictures in it and if you ever need Chinese names look in this book! I do not paint but I write and I was writing a story set in China and I found many great names but as I was looking for names I was attracted to the pictures and started to look more at them than the names for my characters.
3,Meh.,"I bought these as part of a temporary kitchen I'm putting together. It's a good thing it's temporary. This was less than easy to assemble, not very sturdy, and the shelves come out of their holders at the slightest provocation. I was dismayed to see that the only things holding this to the wall are some small plastic tabs that fit under the screws. I wouldn't store anything heavy in this. It's not as attractive as the Sterilite stuff I bought. I guess it's okay, but, if I could have found somehting better, I would have bought it."
4,A new parent delight,"This book is the best. I bought it and started reading it before I had my daughter. Now she's almost five months old and I'm still using for ideas, methods, and advice. I love it and I have been and will continue to recommend it to all new parents."
4,"4 great songs, one re-make","I love Wood Jackson, Shadow Man, & When the Boys Come Marching Home These 3 songs are mellow & slow, but excellent Bowie songs. Very much in the Heathen mood. His voice sounds great. 3 must-have songs for Bowie fans. The last track You've got a Habit of Leaving is a remake from Pinups I think. Doesn't do much for me. And of course Slow Burn is good."
1,do not buy in the states,did not realize it was from different country .apparently it is from.england will not play in states ..waste of money
3,Says More About Germans than Istanbul,"My wife game this book as a birthday gift thinking that I would be interested in the story (murder mystery taking place in Istanbul). Make no mistake, this book is about young intellectual (and alcoholic) Germans than any murder story taking place in Istanbul. It is tough reading and is interesting in its portrayal of the seedy underworld of Istanbul. But, in the end, you learn more about the mindset of a dissatisfied, abused and avant garde pseudo-artist."
1,Financial Scorecard ...,"If you would like to pay... for basically two pages of a high level summary, than order this document. I can't call it a book as it only took me 5 minutes to read and was in total 4 pages with only two of them in text. This should not be offered for sale but only as an advertisement."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I absolutely love the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" soundtrack and listen to it over and over again. When I found this collection I was so excited I couldn't wait to get the album. What an extreme let down it was to hear mediocore music by notable artists. I wish I had saved both my time and my money on this one and passed it on by..."
1,No meat in this one,This was the first downloadable article I have purchased. Be sure to pay attention to the particulars. This is only a 3 page article. There was really no meat or practical tools in this regarding implementation of Balanced Scorecard. A complete waste of my money. Another gotcha - Amazon will not issue a refund on this downloaded material.
3,English Novel,"I have to admit, I didn't choose to read this book. I had to read it for english. When I started reading it I foung it a bit boring, but if you don't read till the end you will never know if it was good or not.The Re-appearance of Sam Webber is about the life of Sam Webber, an 11 year old boy, whose father had disappered. You read about his thoughts and feelings, all the struggles that he faces and how he overcomes them. It's not the best book i have read, but it's not the worst either. When you start reading it may seem a bit boring but after you finish you realise that you actually know a lot about the characters and how they influence Sam and help him move on in life."
1,"Not by a Long Shot ""To Kill a Mockingbird""","I had read that this book was a little like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and it got 5 stars, so I gave it a shot. Well, it isn't like ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" And it didn't deserve 5 stars. It's an OK book, it's not horrible, it's well-meaning, but it's amateurish. The characters are bloodless, the dialogue is blunt and forgettable, and the setting is generic. If ""The Reappearance of Sam Webber"" had had a rewrite, and then a re-rewrite, maybe I'd give it three stars, tops."
3,The Review of Sam Webber,"The Rappearnce of Sam Webber , show you the racism and the urbanviolence of a neighbourhood called bailtmore where we met a 11 year old boy trying to fit into a new school and trying to keephis mum form falling a part because of his dad leaving and top of all that his has a bully after him and when things look bad then Sam meats a black janter by the name of Greely and as the book goes on and Sam realis that where he lives isn't so bad after all."
2,The Reappearance of Sam Webber,"This book is extremely well written. The author portrays a great understanding of Urban American life. While the book is full of fantastic description the author sometimes takes it over the top and describes the same situation in so many different ways that its easy to lose track of the story. Also, the story could end at every chapter. The author doesn't give any suspence or enthusiasm to continue reading. For a commited reader this is a fantastic piece of writing but for most others it is (I'm sorry to say) down right boring."
1,Very poorly made and legs constantly fall off.,"At first this toy seemed wonderful, but after a few days all of the pieces started falling apart. The stethoscope fell apart, as did all of the other little pieces. The legs constantly fall off and never seem stable, the back of the table falls off. In fact, every single part of the toy easily comes apart, making it very frustrating for my 3 year old. After a few days of trying to keep all of the pieces intact, we just gave up.The concept is a good one, but the way this toy was made is very poor. The design is good, but there is no thought in keeping the pieces together. The quality of all of the medical apparatus is very poor. For my 3 and 5 year olds, this toy just did not hold up. I would not recommend this toy to anyone unless you enjoy putting the legs constantly back on, as well as all of the pieces on the table such as the scale."
2,suprised with fisher price,"I have never had a complaint about any item I have ever purchased from fisher price. I must say I was not happy with this toy at all! Cheaply made, legs fall off easily, and parts of the toy come off VERY easily. EX: stethescope has already broken after only 4 days of use... comes right off as soon as you pull on it. When my daughter went to put it around her neck to get it on her ears, it bent. I wouldn't waste my time buying this!"
5,FLOORED!!!,"When I heard the incredible sound of the ""BEST 50 "" series I snatched every one I could find. These so shame the domestic Impulse releases that I was shocked! The cymbals so pure, the piano so full of inner detail, the drums with definition, the bass not just a thudding fog, and Coltranes sax absolutely rich and present. You should hear Ascension! Crescent, Meditations, Expression, and Coltrane Plays are also fabulous. Some people could not understand why I panned some of the Originals series. These are why. The recent SHM series from Japan is also very good and with the BEST 50 series completes the Impulse albums Coltrane released."
4,It put me on the bottom of the food chain!,It was great! Especially the man eating monster teacher who gives a couple chances to the kids. There are four kids trying to get out of that school. did they make it? you have to find out by reading the book and don't end up on bottom of the food chain like me or CHOMP you'll be eaten!
5,This is not Christianity Lite,"This is not a ""lightweight"" book. This book is not an attempt to make you ""feel good"" nor is it an attempt at some shortsighted pop psychology ploy about ""love banks"" and ""love tanks"". Thankfully, God has raised up men like Bob Lepine, whose first priority is to honor God--by obeying Him. That is what this book is all about: Biblical fidelity in the role of a Christian Husband.This book is Bible-saturated and very approachable. The book is broke down into three sections: The Qualifications of a Christian Husband, The Model for Husbands--Jesus Christ, & The Task--How to Really Love Your Wife. In each of the sections Mr. Lepine tackles many of the task that we, as Christian Husbands, should be doing from a biblical perspective. I can't think of a more important book to read for any husband. As a newlywed husband myself, I have gleaned much from this book and wholeheartedly and enthusiastically commend The Christian Husband."
3,A Lot of Fun,"This is the first Elvis movie I ever saw. There are better Elvis movies (""Jailhouse Rock"" being the best, I think), but this is one of my favorites. It is a good comedy (not unintentionally, either) and has some great songs, especially the title track. Elvis is a bit chubby here, though not as bad as he would get in the mid-70s, which caused him to later dismiss the film. A painless, goofy way to spend 90 minutes."
4,Monster Standard,Good product and worth the price. hard to tell the difference between these cable and more expensive cables
1,Terrible deal - wish I hadn't got it,"This watch was a Father's Day present for me from my wife.The first watch shipped to me didn't work - it wouldn't wind and therefore wouldn't run. It was shipped back to the retailer (who wouldn't send a new one until I returned the old & paid for shipping on the old, broken one!).I then noticed after the first month that the 'month' indicator dial didn't work on the replacement. The days would progress as normal, but after 31 days the month remained static.I contacted the seller, who refused to accept it for a refund or issue a new one because it was 'used, and he can't sell a used watch'.Short story: a terrible experience with a inferior, terrible product. I will NEVER buy or recommend Adee Kaye watches to anyone."
2,Condesending Attitude is too Much,The subject matter is of much interest to me as I have a BBA and an MBA in Operations Management and have only worked in manufacturng environments. I am staring a new job tomorrow and catching up on reading about my profession after being unemployed for 5 months. This author's writing style is too condesending though. I am at Chapter 10 right now out of 20 and it's about value-stream mapping which will be very helpful for me to brush up on sense I am starting a new position. I am going to try to get through it but I would not recommend it.
5,"Gentlemen, Start Your Engines","The story of the ONE man responsible for the preservation and rebuilding of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway after WWII. (Although Anton Hulman supplied the money, persuaded by Mr. Shaw) The ""will"" of a man to see the place where he and others had so much success in racing, not be turned into a ""housing track"", or an ""industrial complex""! His early years in racing, when men were MORE important to winning than machines. A time when there were NO safety rules and little protection from death. This book is the story of the TRUE SPIRIT of racing, told by one of its best drivers that ""lived"" through those perilous times, form the ""drivers seat""!"
5,Cool,"Now I can drive the CJ on trails and idle without running hot, Bolted up and works well, i am pleased, I"
2,Not The Depicted Design,I ordered these because I liked the muted florals but that's not what I got. The item number is the same but not the design. The price was not worth sending them back though.:(
5,Intimate lives of famous people,These books are great light reading. They are filled with well written stories about very interesting people. The books are divided into chapters about various people's more intimate home after telling us of the person's historical significance. They have just enough information and antidotes to make you want to know a little more and then they move on to the next person and their life.The set I have was published in 1928 and apparently never read until I purchased it because a lot of the pages are sealed together on the front of the page and need to be cut open to read. This volume set must have been the sort of thing to have on your shelf for looks.It is very enjoyable reading.
1,they want to teach her a leason.,"Reva Dalby is a stuck-up,spoiled,rotten, girl who never cares about other people but herself.Then someone is out to get Reva. They want to give her a holiday season that she will never forget."
2,"Ok for a text book, but there are better books out there","This was a required text for a MBA management class I was taking. While I enjoyed the class, the book itself was disappointing, and even the authors point out that many of the surveys and self-analysis tools are limited because the better tools are all proprietary. Most of the book is a re-hash of standard managment philosophy, with some statistical justification thrown in.If you are looking to improve your management skills, I recommend going straight to the primary sources, which includes most of Stephen Covey's books, along with other management and self-improvement books like Emotional Intelligence, Execution, One-Minute Manager, etc. This book tries to cover the same ground, but ends up being far less informative or interesting then the popular management books it emulates."
3,Not to be used with the Alternate Edition,I bought this book assuming it was the solution guide to the Alternate Edition book (since Amazon.com had it listed as the solutions manual for the Alternate Edition) but it is completely different problems. This is to accompany ONLY the 10th Edition.
3,Thomas' Calculus 10th Students Solutions Manual Part 1,"The manual has alot of mistakes in last part of chapter 2 and in chap 3. The numbers do not match the problems in the book, and some oare odd and some are evens, not logical reasoning for it, plus they left put to whole sections in chap 2 (2.8,2.9). I was not very pleased with the manual."
5,Straight-forward information for novice or veteran,"There is a ""fog"" of myth and misinformation surrounding muzzleloading. Sam Fadala cuts through the fog. Using his own experiences and testing based on scientific method he presents a wealth of information for anyone interested in black powder shooting and hunting. Begins with the basics and goes on to in-depth coverage of many aspects of muzzleloading. A great source of information for those just getting started; valuable reference source for more experienced shooters. This book is very ""user friendly"". It flows naturally from subject to subject in Dr. Fadalas very ""readable"" writing style. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone."
2,Maybe Their Next One will be Better,"I bought this item pleased that I would now be able to eliminate two remotes from my current setup--AND I wouldn't have coding problems with the remote as my TV is a 32"" Samsung LCD. That part all worked fine. But the VHS player was SO noisy--I had it set to record at a certain time, and when it came on (as I was reading) it was so annoying I had to turn it off. The second unit I got on exchange was exactly the same. It is the motor that drives the tape that makes the noise--as I played a prerecorded tape with the same problem.The other main drawback is all controls are on the DVD side, even the recording of the VHS and the elimination of channels for the VHS tuner. This is very awkward. Logic does not tell one to go to the DVD side to set up VHS items.On the plus side, the tape tracking automatically sets itself so all tapes play well, and the HD output for the DVD (won't work for VHS)is good. Can't get past the motor noise--it's going back."
1,Total garbage.,"I wanted this unit for its HDMI output but it didnt work when I brought it home and hooked it up. The player made this horrible buzzing sound, the DVD drawer would not open, and the VCR wouldnt play. Thats not so good I think. Took it back to the store and got something else that does work and its not a Samsung!"
4,as pictured,"My son had a harness for his dog like this and it worked extremely well for a terrior. I have a mini dachshund and it works pretty well as long as you don't pull on it too hard. He has figured out if he can stretch his head out the whole thing will come off when you tug on it. If you have a normal dog, this harness works exceptionally well...much better than a regular collar. If you happen to have a Houdini like my dog you just have to be more cautious. I would recommend this item to my friends."
3,Dora Pirate adventure,My two year old daughter was so exicited to get this movie but now that it is here she prefers her other dora movies to this one
5,Best Dora DVD So Far!,"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES this Dora DVD. It's in musical form, so if your child loves music -- BUY IT! My daughter is speaking Spanish all the time now, and she recognizes it when she hears it out in public. Dora is worth the money!"
5,Super Fast!!,"Ordered and paid for this product on a Wednesday, received the movie on Saturday. Very fast service. Exactly what I ordered. It was unopened. It was a great experience."
3,Laurel & Hrdy Brats,"I loved the short when I was younger. I was surprised to see this in color and with voices. It was good though, just different."
5,Inglath Cooper did it again!!!,"This story is yet another in a long line of fantastic stories written by Ms. Cooper about a small town heroine. This story in particular resonated with me as I too grew up in a small town and moved away. Sometimes that old adage ""Heaven is in your own backyard"" really does turn out to be true. Buy this book today, and find out how this heroine is able to come back home and find the love of her life."
2,Dog Harness,I didn't like this harness as it is very stiff. My dog didn't like it either. I believe it was just to uncomfortable for him. He figured out a way to chew it up so I am not using it any more!
4,Reasonably priced 6 button controller,"I was looking for a controller to do some retro sega pc gaming, so something with a 6 button layout. I already had a ps2 to usb adapter, so this was a perfect fit there. I'm actually not a huge fan of fighting games... and have actually never played a street fighter game as I was a Mortal Kombat fan growing up and had sega products. This pad was bought mainly for the price and fact that i already had a ps2 adapter. It plays reasonable well, however it is larger in both width, and fatter when gripping than i'd prefer. It looks and feels bulky/plastic-y like a kid's toy. The controls are responsive though, and I didn't really find it uncomfortable to sit for a few hours of use. I have since replaced this in everyday use with some original sega saturn pads and an adapter that i picked up for cheap, and i definitely prefer the size and overall feel of the saturn pads to this. However for 11 dollars when i purchased it, i have no regrets."
4,Where did these guys go?,"""Dulcinea"" was the VERY first rock album that I bought. I heard the song ""Somethings Always Wrong"" and was just mesmorized. A few of the songs may not fit the style of the rest of the songs, but it's a very melodic album. Favorite song on the album is ""Inside"", with bassist Dean at the helm. It's just, where did these guys disappear to. They make good music and just vanish. Kind of like the Gin Blossoms. Yet, still a great band with great talent."
4,The Toads' best effort to date.,"I may not have heard all of this band's CD's, but this very-strong effort is better than the lackluster ""Coil"" and ""Fear"" CD's and blows away the lousy ""In Light Syrup"". The 1 CD to have by this group, in my opinion. Every song (except the last) is strong."
5,One of their best,I am a true Toad fan and have seen then about 8 times over the years.This is one of their best CD's.
5,A spiritual and unrelenting picture of life and its subtelty,The album Dulcinea is an indepth look at the philosophy of one's life. It captures radiance in religion and the stupid things we do in life. The lyrics grace the perfectly coreagraphed music and paints images life at it's best. I could not recommend any other cd more than this.
5,LOUD,"i bought this a while back maybe, 2 years. they work just as well now as when i bought them. they are very loud but have poor sound quality. not the worst, but you will have to put on the bass reducer on your ipod to keep them from crackling. i bought two of these and i purchased a headphone splitter (allows you to put 2 headphones in 1 ipod) and both of them at the same time are VERY loud, with just one i could play on a filled bus and you would be able to hear it well, and 2 is more than enough. i reccomend these, not for computer or listening at home, but more at public places where you'd need loud speakers that run on batteries."
2,Slick Soap,"Excellent production--great cast, director, cinematography, etc., all in aid of making a superior soaper. Will the mean old rich lady get her comeuppance? [organ chord] Will Milt find out who his *real* father is? [organ chord] Will Becky and Ralph get back together again? [organ chord]Tossing in a Columbine-type element doesn't add the *contemporary* touch that the writer hoped would elevate this beyond soap. Without it, all that would be missing would be the Palmolive ads; with it, we just get the heavy hand of nastiness.Several have mentioned Nobody's Fool (a truly great movie) as a parallel, but that's like comparing King Lear with Days of Our Lives."
2,Plodding Movie of a Great Book,"Maybe it is just impossible to do a great movie for such a great book but this one did not do it for me. The plot is slow moving for an hour or so, the movie does not really build up the characters very well, and even the acting from the great cast seems forced most of the time.I was disappointed."
2,Don't bother.,"I see why people get all crazy about this ""film"" - it depicts what people THINK us New Englanders are like, when in reality it's not even close. This movie/tv-special was packed with stars, but I couldn't tell you WHY. It's pretty boring. I read the book and didn't like it much so I couldn't tell you why I bothered to watch this thing too. Yah, the acting is fine, but the story is cluttered and confusing and there is NO RESOLUTION at the end. These people spent all this money and put all this effort into making this thing only to kill it all with a ridiculously stupid quick ending.People like to think New Englanders are hokey home-town people but really we're not. I don't go to a local diner and talk to people and no one I've ever known does either. I was very disappointed in this movie cause the ending is just not worth it."
5,Really well-done,"I really like this movie/ miniseries. Ed Harris is amazing, as usual (see Pollack). I give it a 5 relative to movies of it's type. Citizen Kane it isn't. But, for a laid back story about real people in a real setting, it couldn't have been done better. Re:Another review that called it slow-paced and boring, what do you expect? I assume you need a car chase and gunshots every 15 seconds to be satisfied. Stick to action junk. I like reality."
5,Offers Great Electronica Music,"Seen that this also happens to be a great game ... I tried to search for tracklists for the electronica tracks and came across the album. The soundtrack is great !! If you like big breaks, drum & bass, or just general electronica music. Sure they left out other great tracks from such great artists as Princess Superstar and Grandadbob's ""This Is It!"" and ""Mmmnn"", but these tracks as well make up for it. So ... this time we'll let it go =p Get it if you like this music or the music from the game !! And if your new to this music give it a try."
3,A Bit Bulky,"I found this item well made, like every Tamrac product, however, all the plastic, velcro, and canvas took up more room in my camera bag than the items this kit stores. This is a large and bulky item. My wife now uses it for sewing items when traveling."
1,Rubbish,It seems every record I look up on Amazon has at least 4 stars. they really all can't be that good can they? I need to test the system... So I thought to myself what is the worst record I've ever heard? and it dawned on me that it was Sponge's Rotted Pinata. so I looked it up...This CD got 4.5 stars??? thats the same rating OK Computer got. I'm done.
2,Not what I expected,"I've read Code Complete 1 and 2 and though they're strictly about code I found them more entertaining than this book. With this book I'm getting a little ""history"" lesson and a little info on what the guys at Chandler are like, their dogs names, their hobbies, etc. I also stopped a little after 200 pages because I expected to read a good story but what I got instead was some story, some history, some code terminalogy, some stupid acronyms and lots of bouncing around in between. Won't send it back, but I'll only read the rest of this if I'm in prison or trapped and bored somewhere"
3,"Some great stuff, but where's the rest of the great stuff?","I've been waiting for years for the half-hour SCTV shows to be released on DVD as I always felt that their best material was in the half-hour syndicated format. Then, when they finally do release some of the half-hour shows on DVD I discover that the publisher leaves out some of the best material?! I can't believe it. This show was not the same with Duke, Rosato, or even Short. The crew of D. Thomas, J. Candy, H. Ramis, J. Flaherty, E. Levy, C. O'Hara, R. Moranis and A. Martin is what this show was all about. Until I can get ALL the material featuring those specific cast members, I'm going to have to consider very carefully whether or not I'll be buying this or any other set. I'm giving this 3-stars for the good material that is here, I only wish that what was here was all 5 stars worth of material that I wanted."
4,craze in every ways,"i can't stand it when they release ""best of"" dvd's. there's always going to be something that someone else thinks should be on the collection.i'm still waitng for the sammy mauldlin episode where he changes the format to ""mauldlin of the night"". sammy has one sparkling glove on, starts singing and using a stunt double to do the worst break dancing moves you've ever seen. he goes on to tell johnny carson ""sorry for stealing all your ratings!"". absolutley halarious, i could watch that a million times and still think it's funny.please tell me that didn't get cut out of any of the rhino dvd's?!?!?!?!"
3,"Like many ,many others","I was disappointed in the selection of skits. I'm not an SCTV historian, with perfect knowlege of what was season 1, 2, 3, etc. I also don't remember exactly what shows were on what network. Still, I thought I remembered the intro introducing ""Dave Thomas as the beaver""? Correct? Was that intro only in the earliest of episodes? That intro wasn't here. I suspect what were labeled ""the early years"" for this dvd were actually more like the middle years. I'm 50, and saw this when it was new, but I didn't even remember Robin and Tony; evidently they didn't impress me much then. I enjoyed earlier episodes with J.C. and Catherine O. far more. A nice touch in this one were a few appearances of the not-so-scary Count Floyd, and Bob and Doug- who took our country by storm, eh? Overall, I think the title is misleading, and can only consider this a very average compilation."
1,Mildly disappointed.,"I don't know how ""The Best"" were selected for this set. Perhaps my memory of SCTV has faded over the years but I do remember a good deal of SCTV early years episodes that were most amusing, especially those with Catherine O'Hara whose appearance is sadly sparse in this collection. The 90 minute shows which came out later though very good were quite commercialized and lacking the ""edge"" of the early 30 minute shows. It is a disservice to SCTV fans not to have ""SCTV - The Complete Early Years"" available. I and countless others would certainly buy them..."
5,Unusual Book --- A Keeper,"Martha Moody is definitely a book I'll be reading again. It's a keeper.It's kind of an unusual book. The main character, Amanda, is given to rather fantastic type daydreams and musings.She is wed to a somewhat taciturn man named John Linger, but neither of them appear to be in love with the other.She becomes quite captived by Martha Moody, a woman who runs the general store in town. She takes her cow, Alice's, butter into town to sell to Martha.Soon Amanda is spinning fantastical yarns in her head about Martha.The book is written in a delightful, captivating style, and the women in it are quite unique and interesting characters."
3,It's a hard one to get into,"Now this seems to be a bit of a cult album among some Shamen fans - they see it as a perfect antidote to the Ebeneezer Goode anthem that tortured the charts for a long time . Personally I find this antidote a bit hard to swallow . A couple of the pop tracks are a bit bland and tasteless , the more experimental tracks are even more varied in terms of how good or bad they are . Some are pretty dark and trippy but the others just verge on the brink of completely out there , a bit too much for my liking ( and I have to admit that is something of an achievement ). The second CD follows in a similar vein . Explore by all means but if you don't like it I can understand you as I'm not sure about it eitherOne to buy only if you want to"
2,tripods didn't work,"I bought this package for my husband when I bought him his new canon rebel xt hoping he would be able to use the tripod. Well, you get what you pay for with this package. The tabletop tripod would not hold up his new camera it wobbled all over the place. The 53"" tripod has problems too, when you mount the camera on top of the tripod you can't see the level and it won't hold the camera in place for you. The only good thing I can say about the package is that the camera case was nice and does the job. However if you are looking for a lot of storage this is not the case for you. We are able to fit his camera and a few extra filters a battery and extra flash cards."
2,Sorry,"I'm sorry to report this is just a pale shadow of the original TV show (which was amazing). This one apparently had next to no budget, and none of the fabulous human actors (Seth Green, Eugene Levy etc) which made Greg The Bunny so funny and textured. Instead it feels like they just sat down and improvised the whole thing."
5,Excellent with Yahoo Messenger,Great concept and product which REALLY works! I use this with yahoo messenger and avoid long distance phone call charges.
5,"Tamar, Toni, Towanda, Tracy and Trina","In that order! Tamar is just flat out OVER the top and I love her. Tony is the classiest sister of them all. Next is Towanda with her LOSER husband. I can't stand HIS *ss! Tracy keeps me laughing and I love how much she wants to be in the mix. Trina? She's just a mess. I love this SHOW! Thank you seller, you were quick and I'm HAPPY!"
5,Had to Have it!,"I have become so addicted to the Braxton Family that I was too geeked upon finding the dvd for the first season. I just had to have it. I can only hope they release a dvd for season 2 and 2.5. I loved the show and thought it was huh-larious, lol. To be able to watch the dvd of the first season at anytime just seemed too good to be true. It definitely stays in rotation with my other movies. Especially when I got 4-5 hours to kill, lol. Great buy!"
3,Great for kids' scrapbooks,"I used these with my girl scout troop to make their own scrapbooks at the end of the year, and they loved them! The pages are a good size for 5x7 and 4x6 pictures, and the pages are cardstock, so they hold up well to the amount of glue that small children like to cover things with!"
3,nice,I sent itj back it was to large for me. I expected it to be smaller. I am ordering a smaller version.
2,Koopsta's Worst,"This was Koopsta Knicca's worst in my opinion. I think it was the production, I don't know who produced it, but they didn't do a good job. This is low budget. There were some alright tracks though, but not like his other albums though. In the cd book there were these fun fact-type things, I thought that was really fu**in' cheezy. and the label is ""Mindz Music""... Is it me or is he copin Hypnotize Mindz? I still like Koopsta better than them, but come on now. Definately get any of his other CD's before this one though. Check out Devil's Playground or The Mind of Robert Cooper."
5,It saved my marriage from a cyberaffair!,"About a year ago my wife began chatting and suddenly developed a cyberaffair with a man she met over the Internet. Our once happy marriage quickly turned into chaos as she now wanted a divorce. Not only was this difficult for me to cope with, but our children ages 9-14years didn't understand the personality changes that took place over their mother. Kimberly Young's wonderful book explained the lure of cyberaffairs and online relationships. It is the first book to really get at the heart of what makes cyberaffairs so seductive. Not only does she speak to the ""addicts,"" but her book offers specific ways that spouses can cope with cyberaffairs and gives practical advice on how couples rebuild the trust in their marriages. After reading the book, my wife and I are now in marital therapy and on our way to repairing our relationship. All I can say is thank you to Kimberly Young for writing this book as it helped save our family from falling apart."
3,It's okay,"The scale looks like the kind in a doctor's office. I did not receive the counterweights as advertised, but overall the scale works great."
5,Review Physician Balance Beam Scale,"Excellent product. Entirely satisfied, a lot for the money...Received on time and in good condition."
5,EXACTLY like the doctors,"This scale is IDENTICAL to the ones you can buy at *********.com for four hundred dollars more. The markings are the same, the weights are the same, everything is identical.This is a steal for a real medical scale.I am not kidding, this is the same one as the medical supply houses use.Assembly took about five minutes- they also include the little tool you need to tighten the bolts."
1,Broken product,It took almost a month for the refund. Can't exchange it because Amazon doesnt carry the product any more. I have never returned anything from Amazon but my 1st return experience was not too encourage. The help desk was not helpful at all.
1,Mechanical Failure,"The balance beam rubs against the side of the metal hole, gets stuck and does not tell the correct weight."
5,Health O Meter Physician Balance Scale,"Very Nice scale, easy to assemble taking only a matter of seconds.Works perfectly.Nice quality balance scale at a reasonable price.If you want a decent balance scale I would Highly recommend it."
5,"Great fun, an amazingly talented cast","Superb quality CD. Superb singers. Superb performers. Superb arrangements. I don't know what more you could ask for.Cheyenne Jackson is a talent of the first order, and I frankly like his renditions of these songs far better than I liked the original Elvis Presley recordings. Jackson is a real find: a brilliant singer, actor, and dancer. One critic called him a cross between Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley... that is very true, and yet I must say Jackson also has an intelligence and humor about him that neither of these stars ever achieved. Cheyenne Jackson may well be the most talented man in America right now.The entire cast gives powerful & adorable performances. I have never seen a Broadway show with as much energy and joy as ""All Shook Up."" Once you have seen the show, this CD brings back memories of all that incredible action that took place on stage. It is truly a must-have for anyone who has seen the show."
4,Great product for the price...,This is a great product for the price...it would be better if you could tighten the resistance.
5,More than just a chick lit!,"After reading some intense historical romances, I was in the mood for something light, cute and funny. I'm ecstatic to say that I found all of that and more in See Jane Score! This was my first book of Rachel Gibson and I'm now a huge fan! Luc and Jane's love story is natural yet special, simple yet profound and I found myself turning page after page wanting more. I still can't get them out of my mind even after I'm done with the book. Well, I'm off in search of more, by this fabulous author called Rachel Gibson!"
4,4.25 Stars,"Sweet and sexy romance, fabulous heroine, amazing hero. Up until the last 75 pages it was on track to become my all-time favorite sports romance. Unfortunately, the last couple of chapters dragged a bit and the story became cluttered. I think it would've been a 5-star book if it had been wrapped up about 30 pages earlier and the syrupy final chapter had been left out. Still an excellent book though, and in my top 5 sporty romances."
3,Nothing special.. Not loving the main character,"This book was just an easy read.. Kept me busy for a little while. I liked the plot of the story but I did not like the main character at all, no idea why he likes her. Cute romance, not mad I bought it but not the best."
4,"It was a good book, but not the best in the series",The book was just okay. I thought the character development better in the first book of the series. Was a quick read.
5,Hockey Hunks...Under-Explored Romance Heroes!!,"Reader in Napa...Luc Martineau is probably an ""average"" looking hockey player. Rachel Gibson was right on in choosing hockey as the background for this novel, as hockey players are really an untapped source for romantic novel heroes. They tend to be chauvinistic, pigheaded and oh so attractive. Ms. Gibson pretty much captured the flavor of hockey life, but she kept calling the Stanley Cup-seeking Luc a Conn Smythe trophy winner...if she had only done a little more indepth research, she would have found that the player who wins the Conn Smythe trophy is the most outstanding player in the Stanley Cup Finals (and usually from the winning team). I'll cut her a little slack because she was right on about most of the other hockey facts. This was a cute book, quick read with just enough steam to keep you warm on a cold winter day."
4,Loved it!,"I read Ms. Gibson's first book in the Chinooks series. This is the second one I've read and I can only say it's gotten so fantastically better! A really great story, with well thought-out characters, believable dialogue, and sweet hot love scenes. Keep these types of stories coming, Ms. Gibson!"
5,i so was missing the old days,its was so nice to go back an see good tv i know its not for every one but i wish thay would remake it
4,Funny to watch,"It's from the 70's, but the kids love it. I was looking for something cheep with a lot of episodes for a road trip. Did the job!"
4,Overall a great buy,This is a great crockpot and it is really great for sauting ingrediants prior to slow cooking. The one thing I don't like about it is that it claims you can sear with it. My idea of searing is browning on all sides over high heat. This crockpot can not be put over a high flame just low to medium-low on the stove top so I still have to use a seperate pan to sear things. Besides that one flaw I think it a great buy and slow cooks wonderfully. The cookbook that it comes with has easy and for the most part healthy recipes that are not overloaded with salt as alot of slow cooker recipes are. I also love the rustic look that it has. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Boo,"Altho very attractive and potentially usefull, my soap dispenser has a cheap chrome pump that has never worked properly. It looks nice on the sink but was a very big pain until I found an oold plastc pump from a liquid soap jar as a replacment. Sorry, but this one was a total loser.LH"
3,not as great as I was hoping,"Maybe I didn't take care of this like I was supposed to but it was my first fountain and I did follow the directions for care that came with it. For starters it was actually too quiet for me even after adjusting the pump flow. I could still hear the pump over everything else. Also, I didn't realize how much evaporation there was. It required constant refilling or else the bells didn't rotate properly. I tried adding fountain pebbles and all I accomplished was ruining the flow of the pump (and ergo the bells) and then a nice film of mildew covered the fountain and oxidized the metal. Last but not least I finally threw it away when one of the plastic stand pieces broke off so it kept toppling over. Now I am looking for a simple, less open fountain (I did like the bells) ...and I will buy fountain water treatment for it. Live and learn."
1,HEADACHE!!!!!!,"I absolutely hate this toy, it is so loud that you can hear it all through the house and when the little bugs get knocked over on to the spinners it is so loud you wished that you had never have bought it. My daughter got it when she was 6 months old. She is now 15 months and she is just able to play with because it was so loud it scared her. She loves it now but it is a stressed out parents nightmare."
1,Twirlin Whirlin piece of junk...,"That's why my husband calls the toy. Within a few weeks of buying the toy for our son the wheels stopped spinning, we could see the belts that helped it spin coming out, so we took the toy apart (after we notified FP and were told we had to ship it to them at our expense) and fixed it...but the tracks for the belts weren't large enough and it continually broke every few weeks. We finally gave up and threw the toy away. (We still have the toys that stacked on it...the kids all loved them)too bad it didn't work as well as they said it would, because when the toy worked properly it was wonderful. My son loved it."
1,Terrified my tot,"My child is not normally timid, but the first moment I turned on this toy it began spinning the flowers, and playing loud music. She cried and scrambled to get away from it. And to this day all I have to do is pick it up and she will fuss and sometimes cry. This is a baby who when at a scottish festival laughed and clapped when they set off the cerimonial cannons and bagpipers began to play. So needless to say this was not money well spent for us. Infact my sister tried to give me one she bought for her daughter saying she won't play with it. And my wife's sister also tried to give us one she had bought. Also saying her daughter won't play with it."
4,"A lot of fun, but noisy","It is true - this is a noisy item. But if you are talking about how much fun the kids have with it, and how long they play with it - my little boy played with it until it's motor finally ran out. It lasted appx 7 months. He would turn it on and stand on the disks so they couldn't turn, I mean, he really abused it. The music played regardless of whether he stood on it or not. So I think it's pretty darned durable. It's very loud, and the blocks rattle like crazy as they go around, but it's a blast for the kids, and that's the whole point, isn't it?"
1,"Fun idea, but too loud","My son was 7 1/2 months old when he received this product as a gift. At first it seemed like fun, but we quickly realized that it is way too loud and spins too fast. This toy does not have a volume control, nor does it have a slow/fast speed for the spinners. I put it away for a couple weeks and tried it again, but he still cries when he accidently turns it on. The blocks are fun colors, but don't hook together well. My 4 year old likes to knock over the blocks, but I have to take the batteries out of the toy to make it tolerable to be in the same room. The pictures make it look like a small play yard, but the play area is much smaller than I thought it would be."
5,Baby loves it but get out the earplugs!,"I bought this toy for my eight month old daughter. The first time she saw it, she played with it for one and a half hours. She loved it. The spinning wheels are what makes this toy special. She loves to drop blocks while the spinners spin or just stick her foot on it while its going. The blocks are durable and she especially likes the cute animal shapes. The downside to this toy is the loud song it plays. My husband and I were only able to tolerate it a few times. He was, however, able to dismantle the music by disconnecting the wire that runs to the speaker. Also, we did not find the attached mat useful or comfortable for our baby. However, it is not necessary for the toy to function. Overall, we are very happy with the toy and I believe my daughter will find it appealing for many months to come."
2,"Looks like fun, but music is TOO LOUD","We thought the toy looked like a great thing for our daughter. We still think the concept of the toy is great, but the music is too loud. This toy does not have a volume control and the speaker is right beside the start button. You have to bend over the speaker to reach the stacking area also. When the music starts, our daughter begins shaking and starts to scream. We made sure it was the music by taking all the pieces away and starting the toy again. The same thing happened again. It concerns me that the music on a child's toy is so loud and has no volume control."
3,"It says ""basic"" and it means it","The title of this book is misleading. It isn't the ""everything"" breastfeeding book, but the subtitle is more on point, ""basic techniques"" is much more what the author covers. The advice is not much more in depth than that you can find in other general baby books, and doesn't go much beyond getting started with breastfeeding. I turned to this book when my baby was a few months old and I had a day or two of low milk supply, and there was nothing to help me. But if you want general information, there isn't anything incorrect, it's just not very complete."
4,Must have for crawlers,"These knee pads are a must-have for crawlers. I have all hardwood floors and these have protected my babies knees wonderfully. They have a lot of cushion and traction nubbies to keep her from sliding. I even use them outside. The only downside is that they do slip down sometimes, but that is better than strangling her chubby legs with the elastic type. The other problem I have encountered is that the stitching is coming undone. I think this is because the velcro is super strong and when you pull it off there is a lot of strain on the stitching. Given the pros and cons and having tried other brands, I would still purchase these."
1,"Once again, Quinn shows that ANYONE can write a best seller.","I fully hope everyone is forced to read this book and the book to which it is the sequal at one time or another simply to gain an understanding of how the ""other side"" thinks. Quinn manages to yet again turn humans into the heavy and all other forms of life into ""nature"". . . If humans are not natural, did we come from alien craft? If not, then we must have been created on and for this planet. If this is the case, then humans ARE NATURAL and therefore what we do is natural if it is instinctive. If our instinct is to survive on this planet, then how can our existence be wrong?!? Mr. Quinn, how do you propose we turn 6 billion people into ""gatherers""? OH! Maybe we should stop healing the sick! YEAH!! Sheesh! Get a life. . ."
3,new age philosophy,I enjoyed My Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. It was recommended to me by an enlightened reader whom I trust. I found it a fun fast read that brought up some interesting concepts about the evolutionary process and the human view of it. Coming from the mind of a gorilla gave it an interesting perspective. It does give some interesting observations but is another attack against the western culture which doesn't live in harmony with the world environment.
2,Old territory; old literary technique,"Having read Ishmael, I looked forward with eager anticipation to this book. I had found the Story of B to be adequate, but it lacked the power of Ishmael perhaps for no other reason than it lacked the simplicity of Ishmael. Lack of simplicity is not something you can fault My Ishmael for. Unfortunately, the book is largely a retread of Ishmael in both intellectual content and literary technique...and there's only so much sanctimonious lecturing one can take from a gorilla."
4,Good Grip.,Seems to work well. If you have small hands try something else. This grip is chunky. Note that you will have to pretty much take the whole gun apart to install it. Since it was my first time strpping the gun down it took me some time to install but after doing it once I could do it again with eyes closed.
1,Useless,"Beware!This product is not compatible with Vista or 7.Unless you are running XP or older, it will not workThere is no patch available."
2,For Christians Only,I am a Muslim from Somalia and so I wanted to see what Christians say about our Holy Book. This book pretends to be an examination of the Koran but the author tries to show that Christianity is better. In many ways the author's discussion of the Koran is fair to make Westerners more sympathetic to our people and in that his heart is in the right place. But ultimately this is a book by an infidel for infidels. It is not for Muslims.
3,"Not a first choice for these Etudes, but a recommendable one","The somewhat ""boomy"" sound on this CD does not make for easy listening. Piers Lane and Yuki Matsuzawa certainly make a better job with the appallingly demanding writing - especially in the matter of accentuating cross-rhythms. However, the disc did not disappoint me, and there are some interesting, slightly idiosyncratic twists along the way (especially in the Op 8 numbers.)"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A bit odd this one, in look and some of the stories it seems like it is aimed at kids, then another couple of stories are not, definitely not young ones, anyway.Dragon Quintet : In the Dragon's House - Orson Scott CardDragon Quintet : Judgment - Elizabeth MoonDragon Quintet : Love in a Time of Dragons - Tanith LeeDragon Quintet : Joust - Mercedes LackeyDragon Quintet : King Dragon - Michael SwanwickPower mad.2.5 out of 5Rockleberries.2.5 out of 5Dragonbloke nookie.3 out of 5Egg appropriation escape plan.4 out of 5Just plane die.3.5 out of 52.5 out of 5"
5,Perfect!,"It perfectly fitted my Nikkor VR 55-300mm. It is very protective. Besides, you can firmly attach it to a belt, or another bag.Good purchase."
3,I'm very pleased with this item,I was very pleased with the product and the prompt delivery of it. It has performed exactly as advertised. I would reccommend this to anyone needing a metric impact socket set.
1,not as pictured,"They all are there but the case is smaller and are used, I Know they all work the same but where really dirty and I like to keep all my tools clean I did not bitch cause they only cost 20 bucks."
2,ok,"I give this 2 stars because of how broken up the set is, it's my fault for not reading it closer but all the good sizes are not in here, it's a mixed breed"
4,Bueno,"Mucho Grande, Wonderfull! for large family, guest use.Very large , easy to use and easy clean up. cook lovely paella."
1,Up to *#@%&!!,I was totally shocked at the uninteresting dvd collection.it has a good front cover looking much better than it is.Everything is so unproffesionaly acted even from a kids point of view!!
2,Difficult Lawn Sweeper,"I bought this to help keep up my yard. It took almost two hours to put together in the summer sun on my driveway. The instuctions suck! There are two different size pins and nowhere does it tell you that, the order of assembly does not work, I took it apart as many times as I put it together. After I finally got it together, I tried to use it. It is heavy, ungainly and hard to adjust. I used it once and sold it for half of what I paid... couldn't afford the shipping to send it back, cost a fortune, and I sure wasn't going to disassemble the darn thing again!"
2,Outdated and too short,"Book is small paperback and short. Good reference for its time, but not worth $70 I paid for it. This book is outdated. Its talking about analog meters and digital transitor based multimeters as the newest thing. Has good info on design of cp systems and troubshooting interference. I wouldn't trust any of the info on electronic instruments presented in the book for cp testing, as they are so outdated. There must be a more upto date book on this topic. For the price I had expected more content."
4,Good scale,"This is a good scale for infants. Its within 4 oz of the readings we get at the doctor's office. We do wish it was a little longers so that our baby's legs wouldn't stick out (she's 10 months now). The ""hold"" feature that allows you to get a weight even when the baby is moving, fidgeting, squirming etc is great."
5,Love it!,I have a little one with very little weight gain. Purchasing this scale helped to keep the doctor visit costs down. The scale works perfect for us. It was worth every penny.
1,Failed within 8 months,"I bought this in December 07, its now July and the battery wont take a charge and wont power the camera. I checked it with a multimeter and there is no voltage at all. The battery doesn't fit that well in the Canon battery grip for the 40D, as it slips out of the grips easily, and doesn't stay lodged where the contacts are touching the camera contacts. I would not recommend this battery, I am off to by official Canon Batteries from here on out."
3,Good Read for the Hardcore Fan,"This was an okay book, but may be aimed at the hard core fan. I was looking for a history of the park, and this did not fullfill what I wanted. Still it was an okay book that was fairly interesting."
2,Largely lacking in substance,"Like many academics, the writers of this book like to say really obvious things, but using really big words. I will admit that I laughed out loud several times, but I think you'd only find this amusing if you're as tired of vapid pop-culture criticism as I am. There are a handful valid points made about Disney and their impact on modern culture"
5,Rainbow Sandals,"Bought for my wife for trip to FL. Got the single stack, narrow strap and she loves them. Cheers!"
2,Uncomfortable - Did not fit right,The sizing is way off on these. I bought these in 3 sizes hoping one would fit. None of them fit correctly. Either too narrow or too long for my foot. I sent them all back which cost me over $12. So don't buy these unless you've tried them on somewhere and know exactly what size you wear. I imagine that if you were able to try them on first and find out your size you might have better outcome. I found a much more comfortable sandal for me made by Ocean Minded. They fit perfect.
4,Not exactly as expected,"Love Rainbow sandals, but a little disappointed in this pair. They do not look like or feel Iike leather. They are nice, but I thought they would be appropriate for evening at a resort and the looked much more like day beach shoes. They were tight at first, hard to squeeze my toes into the strap. Overall, I am happy with the sandals, but it is not easy to tell that they are leather."
2,Not like the San Clemente classics I'm used to...,"I've been buying and wearing Rainbows since the early 80s -- when Rainbows used to sell at the O.C. Swapmeet, that's how far back I go. I live in these things. However, the new ones I mail ordered are really not like the originals. First they don't have the arch support the old ones had and the three different pairs I ordered from Island, though marked Ladies 11, were more like a men's size 11 and not as stylish as the old ones. I'm going to have to go to Rainbows' outlet in San Clemente to see whether the old styles are still available. Very disappointed."
4,HAVING THE FILTERS-WHEN YOU NEED THEM!!,"REALLY LIKE THIS ITEM A LOT!! WHEN WALKING TRAILS, CLIMBING PLACES TO GET GOOD SHOTS!! IT'S REALLY HANDY TO HAVE A POUCH ON YOUR BELT THAT CAN CARRY SIX(6) FILTERS TO HAVE A SELECTION OF CHOICES ON WHICH TO USE, TO ACHIEVE DIFFERENT IMAGES!! PLUS IT PROTECTS ALL YOUR FILTERS FRON THE ELEMENTS!!!"
2,"Concept great, writing redondent","I thought the concept was great--a woman who has denied her dreams and desires her whole life and finally going after them, reconnecting with her estanged daughter, and finding herself. But somewhere along the way I stopped enjoying this book. I don't know if it was because the book just went on and on about sex toys or all of the crying for joy. Every single paragraph was just overflowing with too much flowerly language for my taste. Example:""In the back of her mind, in a place that never really grows totally weary, a place that is filled with flying daggers to protect the weak, rows of flesh flowers, and arms as wide as the word--a place cultivated...etc (pg 128-129).""The paragraph by itself is written well but when paragraph after paragraph describes the same things over and over again it gets redondent and as a reader I quickly lost interest in the character's list of dreams."
2,Gave up,"I have read only the first 23 pages of this book, that's why I've allowed it two stars, because maybe it will get better and I'll never know. The writing is SO convoluted. Not only is it difficult to follow, but the story dumps so much information at the very beginning that it's difficult for me to care about these characters. Nay, impossible. I will not be finishing this book. One sentence rolls on for half a page. Where is Ms. Radish's editor? Extremely disappointing."
1,Not Even 'Meh',"I am that great rarity: a man who has read this book. Well, most of this book. I have kept going in the thus far futile hope that something will happen. Anything. Anything at all. Any sign of depth beyond ""Women good. Men bad in bed. Sex key to everything!"" A character who isn't straight out of central casting. (""Send us a twenty-something, Birkenstock-wearing, sexually-liberated hippie. NOW!"") A conversation that ISN'T ""one they will remember for the rest of their lives"". A paragraph where somebody says something or does something.It honestly feels like the author had enough material and original thought for about 30-40 pages, but needed a novel. So she stretched. And stretched. This book's great crime is that it isn't a short story."
2,urghhhh..,"at first i really liked this book, but it didnt take long for the main character to start complaining about everything to her sex- life time line to her old gray hair cut, seriously shut up no one cares..i got 3/4 of the way through it until i gave up for good this book wasn't even worth reselling instead i just gave it to good will..i hope the author has better books then this one, because it was just terrible."
3,A good read for a text book,"Even though I purchased this as a text for a class, it was actually an interesting read. It tries to explain the different perspectives of ""terrorism"" and provides examples for the reader to interpret."
5,Top notch Regimental History,"Craig Chapman's book struck a chord here. As one who is very much interested in Gettysburg, and the Overland Campaign of 1864, I am glad I found this jewel of a book. The author writes the story very well, and the research that he has done is exceptional in this tale of the boys from the Tarheel state.This regiment is not as well known as the the 26th NC, but their trevails at Gettysburg was just as horrible. It also illustrates how they were used in the Overland Campaign...and the perils and suffering that they went through in 1864.I heartily recommend the book, and can confidently say if you read it, it will be tough to put down."
2,And the underdog wins the race,"Jeff Bridges plays another role of the washed out middle aged man with no future. His character is a man with no profession, with series of mediocre sales jobs in a small city and unable to support his family. After his wife leaves him and re-marries to a rich guy, he tries to find a way to impress his young, teenage son.The story unfolds with the idea of making an amateur porn film in order to make it rich. His bar buddies pitch in minimal investment and the story takes off.So when the porn movie is no longer a porn movie but still a success to make everyone make some money, this film turns into its own head with a happy ending.When will be see Jeff Bridges in a film really worth seeing? That is what I want to know."
2,A little...light. not a gem,"I had great expectations about The Amateurs. Greeeeat casting, great reviews, HD DVD format...you know, the whole pie.But is not a good movie at all. Actually is worst than you imagine. There's some great ideas here, but the movie sucks.Don't buy it anyway. Rent it first if you don't believe me."
1,Mind-numbing,"Paid $10 for the HD dvd based on the 13 or so glowing reviews here. What a huge disappointment this so-called movie turns out to be! It isn't funny, warm, touching, or even entertaining. Why oh why did I waste $10 on this stunningly boring and unimaginative thing!!!"
2,i was fooled,when i read videography and saw a list of songs i got very excited. finally whole concert performances of classics like RHIANNON or GO YOUR OWN WAY? no just a textbook dull reading of the everchanging and revolving door ways of this up and down group. the men interviewed are scholarly english types who blather on in their praise and knowledge but its of stuff most mac fans know. when they finally get to the part where stevie and lindsey joined the group its a rush thru with just choppy clips of some performances interrupted by yet more observations. i was disappointed.
5,A classic!,"For anyone who knows they like this kind of music, but are afraid to take risks if you don't recognize the artists/ label, fear not. I bought this CD in England in '97, and its still a staple in my cd magazine. Great for dancing, driving, and super-high-energy for working out. You won't be disappointed."
3,Easy to absorb but not enough!,"Organic Chemistry (Test Yourself) can be helpful for you if you do not understand lectures and homework is too hard for you. However, if you are seeking for an in depth material that tells everything about organic chemistry, I suggest you abuse your textbook a little bit more than before."
1,Disappointed,I was hoping this would be tasty but it wasn't and the texture was not cake-like. It didn't work for me.
3,Fun game easily passed up,"I'm not a big fan of RPG's or card games, but this game is actually fun. After being disappointed with SNK VS CAPCOM Card Battle for the DS, I decided to give this game a try. Depending on which Dragonball you have on your card decides how many spaces you can move on the map or attack power during a battle. You also have a number (1-8 or Z) for defense. Later in the game you can combine cards with the same dragonball/number that helps you get you from point A to point B, as well on the battlefield. The card game follows the DBZ storyline from the Saiyan Saga to the Cell Saga. The animations during the battle are also well done to keep things going."
1,Look elsewhere,"The book has lots of terrific pictures, but if you're looking for something to tell you what the inside of Ebbets Field or Crosley Field looked like, this book is short on such details. There are many stories mined from the usual resources recounting what led to the building of the ballparks, and great moments inside them, but ""Diamonds"" is near useless for getting a sense of detail about these ballparks."
2,A Fun Premise Turned Into A Tedious Exercise,"Zurbo came highly recommended to me, but after reading Morons I can't imagine why. The characters are prefabricated and flat, with no appeal; the actual clues to the killer are nonexistent; and the book ends with a fizzle that somehow manages to be almost as tedious and unbelievable as it is out of nowhere... like maybe a quota of words had been met to fulfill a publisher's contract so an end was tacked on. The only thing I can imagine duller than reading this is the actual writing of it, since it doesn't even approach the couch potato equivalent of a creative exercise."
1,Don't Buy-Can't See,I recently bought this game for my pc. At almost the beginning of the game when scrat goes through a rock that is split you can't see anything but yellow & can't find the nuts & then it is blue & the same thing all over again. Why do they sell this stuff if people can't play the game? I have a Windows XP 2005... I read the kid's review. He was right on! What is a graphic card? Can anyone help? The game would be terrific if you could see it to play it.
4,"comprehensive, but ... accurate?","A nice overview of various martial arts taught in obscure and less obscure places. I think I most enjoyed the accounts of Pakistani and Indian wrestlers like Gama. These seem to be forgotten martial artists. There was also some interesting information about the martial arts of Indochina.I give it one less star than perfect, as these same authors have been known to at least tell some tall tales under a psuedonym (""John F. Gilbey"" is one of the two). Since I am no scholar of the martial arts, but rather a sort of consumer of them, I can't really tell if they're pulling our legs anywhere in this book. Some of the Okinawan stuff (which I am actually familiar with the history and practise of) was a bit sketchy, or at least poorly explained. I suspect the farther afield these guys get with the arts covered, the more stuff you might find like that. Who is going to check?"
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this case thinking that because it was hard it would protect my player better. This may have been true except that it didn't fit well...and wouldn't even stay shut. Also, you can't see the screen completely when you put the player in it. Don't waste your money on this! I sent mine back and found a neat leather-like one with a handle at best buy for $20 or so. It seems to be the best, although some prefer the silicone cases (i can't stand the feel of those though)."
5,Carl's in your kitchen too,"Having had the pleasure of eating at Brennans of Houston many times over the past decade I have to say theatmosphere at the restaurant is wonderful, however the food is what makes the experience outstanding. Carl Walkerand his knowledgeable staff have combined their talents to bring an easy to use guide into to your kitchen. It's rareto find a cook book from an award winning chef that doesn't intimidate the casual, cooking enthusiast - this isn't acook book for the bookcase, it's for the kitchen. I recommend the book and the Cajun Enchiladas with RoastedTomatillos Salsa, on page 26."
5,Absolutely one of Don Moen's very best!!!,Each of the selections in Don Moen's Thank You Lord create a wonderful worship experience. Don's integrity and love for the Lord show in his warm and tender voice. This CD is one that will continue to provide blessings for the listener over and over again!
5,Happy with purchase,I was very pleased with the book I purchased used from Amazon. The book came quickly in the mail and it was in perfect shape. The price was great also. I was very happy with the entire experience and will use Amazon again.
3,Not the best book in the series,"I really enjoyed reading the first 2 books, but this one was a BIG disappointment. Compared to the first 2, this book was very dry and boring. There wasnt a whole lot of action or plot going on. The years seemed to skip alot. For example, Leah's Momma gave birth to Abe, then in the next chapter he was 7 years old.A friend of mine is also reading this series. After she read book 3, she vowed not to read the rest of the series. I have already read book 4. It is OUTSTANDING! I told her this and now she is going to read it. So, if you have read the first 2...just get throught number 3 and move on to number 4."
2,"Deliberate Unpolished, Rough, Raw, but Unconvincing","I am a fan of Gilbert O'Sullivan. But this record is extremely difficult to swallow. Not only did Gilbert turned the volume of the piano, a beat-up upright piano, so loud that you couldn't hear his voice or words clearly, he also repeated and pounded the same accompaniment pattern (Um-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) songs after songs. Occasionally, strings or other wind instruments were introduced, but they ended up equalizing and soothing the raw and unpolished piano sound. I guess after making more than twenty records, Gilbert O'Sullivan wanted to introduce a new sound that also matched the ""SCRUFF"" in the title of this CD."
1,Wow...... Edge of your seat suspense....,"Gripping, Thrilling, edge of your seat plot. Truly awesome acting... Kept me glued to the screen the entire time...YEAH RIGHT!!! This sucked... You can see the same amount of skin by looking at the picture of the box. The actress likes to paint completely naked, but all you get to see is the rear view. Nothing else to see here. Theres a shower scene where you get to see some of an outline of the girl.... If they just woulda showed the goods, this woulda been a four or five star rating.... When will they learn that skin sells??"
4,"Minor flaws, but these are the best of what's available","Length:: 4:46 Mins4 stars......not perfect, but probably as good as it's ever going to get, and definitely better than the competition."
4,Chuckster,"This is an excellent set of dumbbells! It's a little time consuming to change the weight but at least its 100% safe unlike my concern with the other dumbbell sets I've had, where a weight may come loose and whack you in the head, lol..."
1,i never stop loving you,a murder of wonderful tonight! Eric Clapton is god and should NOT be touched by country artists!
3,Fragile but good,"This is the 4th cover I purchase for 2 different phones. I like them but they are relatively fragile. To replace the battery, memory card or to reset the phone, one needs to remove the cover and that is the problem. The small parts that hold the cover in place are not designed to be removed and replaced. So they do not last more than a couple of re installations. Besides this the product is great. Fits perfectly on the phone, looks and feels good, and it protects the phone in case of an accident without interfering with the phones functions. I would rate it a 3.5 stars if possible."
4,The Sewing Circle: Hollywood's Greatest Secret : Female Stars Who Loved Other Women,"This is the exact same book as The Sewing Circle: Sappho's Leading Ladies Book, it just has a different cover."
3,Decent,Works well. Batteries not included. Special type needed. I was slightly dissapointed on the threaded (unscrewing) of the focus in the rear. I think a smoother & more stable method would be better. Expensive product but works well.
5,A brilliant and engaging answer to an enduring mystery,"Max Allan Collins has written a delicious take on one of the 20th century's greatest mysteries, the disappearance of Amelia Earhart. Collins has probed deeply for the facts and theories behind this still-fascinating event, and has constructed a meticulous piece of prose that manages to encompass ALL known theories in some fashion, even fashioning attributing real heroism to the little-known Fred Noonan, Amelia's navigator and companion on that last flight. The characters themselves behave just as we imagine they should, given what we know of their actual personalities. Not only is this a page-turner, it's hard to find a moment that does not ring true historically. As an author of an Earhart biography myself, I am astonished and delighted with Collins' entry into the field. If you're not an Earhart buff before reading this book, you sure will be when you're done!"
1,not very happy,I was not happy at all. I ordered a cd with the songs that showed whats on the cd and when it arrived it had different songs on it. Not good.
1,useless,"I've looked at two Conway Twitty cds. #60 and #129. I would have loved to buy either one,not used but new thankyou. Neither are available. How stupid is that. Hence my displeasure and my review is ""useless"" Why bother to list things you can't by in for potential customers?"
1,Was listed as having English subs,"I'm very disappointed in this release. I pre ordered months ago and it was listed as having English subtitles. I prefer anime with subs.The dub for this show is good, but its radically different than the original language. Good thing its 50% off on Amazon.I hope this company doesn't release any more anime in the future."
5,Great Cat Treat,"My cats absolutely love these treats. They can't wait for me to get them out of the box. With one cat having diabetes, I am always looking for good, natural snacks for him without all the grains, especially corn, that is found in most of the treats out there. These are perfect. They are good sized chuncks too so tossing them across the room helps give the cats excersize as well as a nurishing treat. Highly recommended."
3,I'm so disappointed at the DVD!!!,"I got this book shipped to me today. I've been hoping to see a well-structured DVD routine so I can follow, but how disappointed I am! Everything on the DVD, you can find at the T-Tapp website, there is no need to purchase this book and DVD. And I don't think 15 minutes of abs and ""Hoe Down"" exercise can help me lose much weight either, I've been doing kickbox and pilates, the T-Tapp moves are not very advanced for me. But I will give it a try anyway, mix it with my routine or do it after dinner to burn some calories."
3,Good but Needs better organization,I bought this after seeing the author on a local news program. ALthough generally not a believer in quick fix diets or fitness programs--this seemed to have enough substance behind it to try it. When I received the book I was overwhelmed-it's huge--hard to follow and not logically laid out for following the 15 minute program. There is a Cd that comes with it but it only goes through 3 exercises-after 3 weeks I stopped doing it because it was just to difficult to follow--this program needs to be put on a DVD and each sequence of exercises should be choreographed and the movements should be demonstrated as to how to do them correctly.
5,I KNOW IT WORKS!!!!!,"I KNOW the T-Tapp system works and that these are ACTUAL, REAL people - my daughter is on page 16!!!!!"
3,Not user- friendly!,"T-Tapp might be a great system but it's the book that I am rating! For one thing, about half of it it's customer testimonials - a bit too much! And, even if the workouts are short, the time spent studying the pictures and instructions, checking to see what I've missed, worrying if I did it right is a serious drawback. However, just trying to learn the primary back stretch improved my posture a bit, and doing the bonus-dvd: secrets for a flat stomach helped me lose an inch in 10 days, but I gained back 1 cm as soon as I took a 2-day break. I give it 3 stars because I hope that, in the long run, it will prove worthy. For now I am sorry I didn't buy one of Teresa's videos instead."
4,It works!,"T-Tapp really does work! I lost two inches off my waist in the first two weeks and fat just keeps melting off. Plus I have better posture and more energy.My only problem is that it can be difficult to learn the moves from the book alone. Once you have the DVD though the book really comes into its own. Having seen the exercises once then the book is invaluable to learn them properly and the form tips are great.T-Tapp might not be for everyone but unless you've tried it, properly, consistently and with good form then don't knock it."
1,Painful knees,Do yourself a favor and just take a pass on this one. The exercises are ridiculously detailed. I followed them word for word and ended up with piecing pain in my knees for three days and nights after just one try (15 minutes for one move). This woman either does something else to stay fit or has the knees of steel. After reading some of the other reviews especially the one about how people 'jumped' on anyone who had anything negative to say about this program the whole thing smells like a set up scam to me. Other negative reviews for other products don't seem to generate the same response. Just saying. BUYER BEWARE.
3,decent,"It's not the best, and is really light, but it's fun, and good characters, though they need more development. the show's pace is very slow."
3,Could be better,"Save your money if you're into this type of racing game and get GTR-2. Much better graphics, more cars, but it's a sim, racing game. It does take some time to get used to the drive-ability of the cars. I'm big racing gamer, all the NFS's, Juiced, LeMans 24 hour, whatever I can find. This is one was good for it's time, but there's better out there.Racer-X"
4,Nice Black Powder Reloading Manual,"Lots of good information of all types and shows different models of BP guns available of all types, pidyold, rifles, etc. and good technical information"
4,Canon Digital Camera A410,"This is a great entry level camera. It does everything our family needs tremendously. Printing, editing and downloading are simple."
3,"Ok, not great",Pictures are dark and you have to replace the battery often. They should all come with rechargables! Not bad for a kid or someone starting out.
5,Very nice used camera,"It's always a gamble purchasing a used item, but this item came in very good condition, in it's original box with all books, installation disc, memory card, usb cord, and even batteries installed. Camera takes nice clear pictures. Fairly easy to learn to use which is nice as it is my first digital camera. I haven't used it enough yet to wear out the batteries once so I have no true idea how long they last. Works well with my Windows 7 system."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!!,"I ordered this truck - this picture, description, etc. from brainstationtoys through Amazon and what was sent was a tiny matchbox-size truck. The price was extremely low but shipping charges were extremely high so I assumed the low price was to get your attention and they were making it up in shipping charges, or it was one of those fluke decimal places pricing errors you occasionally hear about. WRONG!! I paid over $16 to ship a matchbox truck. If you order -- make sure it's what you're getting. I may rethink using Amazon to order anything anymore."
5,Wow.,"Pictures which are so incredible, information filled book, this was well worth the price of the book, which, in my opinion, was very low.I really enjoyed this book as have my 8 year old nephew, and my 84 year old Dad, and I'm sure my 28 year old on will also. It has so many things which I hadn't known before, and the large pictures worked well for my Dad."
5,Bulova Watch,It's a watch and it works as it is supposed to---I bought it because I needed a watch with time and date.
5,Feldhahn has done it again!,"""The Lights of Tenth Street"" is a real page turner. Her meticulous research into the sex industry and its consequences will stagger you, will enlighten you, and will change you. This book is well written, compelling, and down-right entertaining. You'll be emotionally connected to the characters in this book instantly -- buy this book by the dozens and share with friends!"
5,Page-turner,"It's been several years since I read this book, but I still remember the intensity of the story. It was the perfect story, with every element that you look for. I loved the mystery and all the real-life struggle found in the book. I hope she will go back to writing fiction again sometime soon!"
2,inconvenient,"These hangers are short - the clothing hangs at a higher place on the rack than from any other hanger currently in my closet, which visually looks weird and also is a pain as the hangers get tangled up together. Also, the hook at the front is annoying if you don't want to hang three in a row vertically but as three independent hangers - the hooks take up more space and get caught on other things in your closet. I will not buy again."
3,Read The Hits...,"Personally, I bought the collection to get a 'slight' extended version of ""Love My Way"" by the Psychedelic Furs. It was listed with a playing time of 4:21 on AllMusic.com. That triggered my purchase.Boy was I wrong.Although it says on the disc back cover that ""Love My Way"" is 4:21 in length, it is actualy 3:33. I'm not too happy about that. Don't get me wrong folks, there are other good songs on the 2-disc collection, but, in this case, I want what I want. So much for whining!Other good songs include:1. 'Til Tuesday - Voices Carry (4:21)2. Bonnie Tyler - Total Eclipse of the Heart (6:58)3. Quiet Riot - Cum on feel the noize (4:50)4. Cheap Trick - Talking in your sleep (3:56)5. R.E.O. Speedwagon - Keep on Loving You (3:20)6. Toto - Rosanna (5:32)7. 99 Red Ballons - Nena (English Version! - 3:51)8. Bangles - Walk like an Egyptian (3:22)9. Tommy Tutone - 867-5309/Jenny (3:45)The price is right, so get yourself a copy and check it out!My rating: 3 stars!"
4,Good purchase,Book was received in the condition as advertised. Story is very sad. I came upon the story when it was on TV and that's why I ordered the book.
3,"okay, but ...","The book in in good condition BUT I would not have purchased it because it had a personal, handwritten book dedication inside the front cover. I would have preferred ""discovering"" highligher markings as to discovering an unremovable, personal note on the hard cover inside the book! The fact that it was there should have been told in the description, I feel."
5,Terrific resource,"The Bartlett guides for HIV/AIDS patient care have long been the best and most trusted source of information on this topic. Its great to see that the editing team continues to update this invaluable resource regularly, and that they now include on line updates to bridge the gap between published editions. Highly recommended for HIV and infectious disease clinicians, and for public health professionals that focus on the problem of HIV/AIDS in the developing world."
2,Poorly explored book,"The book has a brief introduction in anatomy, physiology and surgical approaches for dealing with nasal bleeding. The book could has a chapter dedicated for complications and anatomical varietions which can lead for problems, and how it could be managed. It could also include indications in literature for complementing other surgical approaches, since it intends to be a quick reference, for those who are interested on improving and enhancing the knoledge in the field."
5,loved the book,"I was given the book just after finishing my Master's Degree in counseling and only read the 1st few chapters. I didn't pick it back up for 9 years, just happen to stumble upon it while searching through books trying to find some comfort and peace after having a miscarriage. The book reached out and grabbed me and helped me to find the peace I was searching for. Would highly recommend it to someone who keeps searching and hasn't found it yet."
1,What a waste!,"This was an absolute waste! Poor acting, weak script and overall a waste in $ and time! DON'T WASTE YOUR $ LIKE I DID!!!"
1,what when how,the what when how syndrome is through out this anime. it seemed to be missing parts of the story line. i was watching it closely because i have tried 3 times to watch this and each time i wonder how did we get to this place. i did find out that the english dub voices are really bad. switch to the sub the voices really fit well. basically it is one of those anime if you have nothing else to watch maybe try this/
5,Work of Art,LBT is one of NY's premier rock and roll bands. They have so much talent that just explodes from their most recent self titled effort. They have a lot going for them at a young age and I can't wait to see what these guys put out next!
5,That Girl,"That Girl is a favorite series and my husband and I enjoyed when it was aired originally. Over the years we have had only rare opportunities to see the shows again. It's great to own them now and be able to enjoy them all over again. They have arrived quickly and been viewed by us and also by our family who were too young to see the original series. It's a joy to have shows to watch with any age group without fear of embarrassing someone or viewing what passes for humor in these ""modern"" times. The entire cast is easy to watch and always fun to see. Can't help feeling lighter after watching an episode!"
5,A family tradition,"Having grown up using prayers from this book to start and bless important meals, I now pass the book on to friends. The book, coupled with a chalice to pass following the prayer selected, makes a great wedding or other celebratory gift. There are prayer rituals for practically every significant life event you can think of. Recently my husband and I reflected on the prayer in times of natural disaster following the Katrina hurricane. It's a great family tradition to use the Blessing Cup prayers."
5,Will The real Men Please Stand Up,"I really enjoyed this book. Even though the headlines say this book is not available, I found it quite easy. It is also in the public library for those who want to read it. It is truly a wonderful read. I bought three copies so that I could pass it on to my friends. There are some original, unedited copies out there too. I like those the best. It shows the original book. Ella Patterson hit it right on the head for men."
1,Hard to access lower compartments,"The diagram that shows the layout of the compartments implies that the front of the bag unzips, it does not. To access the lower compartments you need to remove the item in the upper compartment and remove the velco fastened divider. It doesn't support the Canon Digital Rebel XL well, a narow camera body tends to want to slide down in the pack. The divider only has 1 velcro strip per side. If it had 2 it would support the lens and body better."
2,I been euchred.,"This book seems to be the only guide to euchre available, so I guess I shouldn't complain. But, I didn't understand a word of it, except for the endless stupid attempts at hick humor, which I could have done without.Oh, well, there's plenty of people I can play poker, hearts, spades, or gin runny with, so I guess it doesn't matter."
1,Don't waste your money - go Carter right away,"We used to buy electric (not electronic) fuel pumps for $12 back in the day. I was surprised when I went shopping for a new one, and this was the cheapest one I could find. Well, I guess you still get what you pay for. Mine did not even make the 10 minutes, more like 2 minutes. Obviously a very poor product, and the bean counters at Mr. Gasket would do well to drop this manufacturer and shop elsewhere in China. I will definitely be wary of Prestolite products in the future."
1,Worked great for about an hour :(,"Tried to replace a pump on an onan generator with this. It installed easily and worked fine for about an hour. The next day tried to start the generator and the fuel pump just wouldn't pump. Made this weird noise instead of the nice clicking the first day. Oh well back to the overpriced onan pump, hopefully it will be more reliable than this mr. gasket one."
2,Temporary use only,"Another low budget option, but you get what you pay for. This unit did work for about 6 months, then started leaking fuel. It is quiet and small. I replaced it with a rebuildable fuel pump. Don't recommend this for any serious use."
1,It's a really bad pump.,"I also had two pumps fail after not even 10 minutes of operation each. This is a very simple application, with the carb only 4 feet away and 6"" above the tank. Well within the spec of this pump. I checked electrical and fuel connections very carefully and did not run the pump dry.The first time, I mounted the pump about level with the centerline of the tank (fuel flowed freely to the pump, as the tank was more than half full.) But it couldn't push it up the 6"" to the carb. The second time, I mounted the pump below the tank. Fuel flowed freely through the pump both times, but didn't pump the 6"" up to the carb.This vehicle had a second fuel pump for its Hunter gasoline heater, of very similar design except 20 years old and rusted (and not made in China). I used this pump as my sanity-check. It was in roughly the same location, and if I connected the power and fuel line to it instead, the car ran fine. The vehicle is a Fairmont MT19 speeder, with an Onan 2-cyl. engine."
5,GREAT GERARD BUTLER MOVIE,I Love this movie. Gerard delivers a great performance as usual. And pierce Brosnon was Great also. Totally unexpected ending. A very well cast movie. great story and Worth the money. I highly recommend it.
3,paying the price,"Cheating and lying always seems to have a price,it just isn't usually as revenging as this...?!The wife of cheater and the husband of the womanget ""even"" in a psychological waythat is ""shattering"" to the ad executive involved.It involves the kidnapping of his young daughter.Well acted and filmed the film is full of action and surprises."
3,Shattered is an amatuer attempt!,"I just watched this movie. I enjoyed all the actors/actresses in this and I thought they played the parts well. The story itself just tries way too hard! The ending is weak, tricky yes, but mostly disappointing!Worth renting, but after watching, you'll know why it went straight to DVD."
2,HORRIBLE ending,"Decent movie until the ending.***SPOILER***Bello's character turns out, IMO, to be one of the most evil characters I can remember seeing in awhile. How you could pretend that with your own child....horrible, horrible, horrible. I was yelling at the TV for him to kill her right there. ANYBODY mess with my kids, even pretending, that is what would happen. They should have just left it the way it was going and it would have been a MUCH better movie.Roller coaster ride for sure but ending makes takes away 1-2 stars."
4,Lives are affected by very sad circumstances.,"Pierce Brosnan plays an psychologically affected man due to his family circumstances; . . . . and he makes you wonder why and what he's going to do next.Butler and Bello suffer Brosnan's crazy antics and you find yourself saying ""such sad circumstances that could happened to anyone at anytime.""Larry"
5,Too Cool,"These are absolutely hysterical. The more you have the better. The little stick men interact with each other and leave their cubes to go visiting. It is really funny to turn the cube over and watch the figure fall to the ground. I bought this for my daughter, but I enjoy watching it and playing with it as much as she does!"
2,Stick Men Behaving Badly,"I bought several sets of these for my young neice. I am glad I previewed (ok, played with) them first. Some of the things these stick men do is not exactly G rated. They fart on each other, hit each other with fists and objects and then laugh as the other one falls down or crawls away, throw tantrums in their cubes, get hit in the groin and fall over...bascially you can't leave two of them alone together without a fight breaking out. One time a scantily pixeled girl popped out of a cake. While it is amazing what they can do with so few pixels, I am sending mine back. IMHO, their behavior is just too bad to be showing to small children."
1,DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.,"If you're like me who watched the first season of OTH and expected a remarkable season 2 and was disappointed.. heavily disappointed, then this DVD isn't for you. I wouldn't waste my money on a season filled with contrived storylines everything from Lucas suddenly loving Brooke, to Peyton suddenly loving Jake to Haley's tortured evil tour with Chris/Tyler Hilton and Keith proposing marriage to Jules when he a few months ago was madly in love with Karen. If you think you can make a connection between your season 1 DVD with this season's DVD, don't hold your breath. It won't happen. Season 2 is a whole different show. A bad show. The show lacks consistency and follow through. Mark Schwann doesn't respect his characters enough to write consistenly for them. Again, don't bother. But Veronica Mars' Season 1 DVD instead."
2,One of my CD's didnt work.....,"The package arrived quickly, and appeared brand new as stated. I watched all of the discs, but my disc 4 did not work. I can not say that this is the sellers fault because the item did appear to be new, and it could have possibly been a problem with the manufactuer."
3,Worst of the seasons,"I admit that I thoroughly enjoy this incredibly soapy melodrama, but this season was my least favorite. There's no basketball, newcomers Anna and Felix bring nothing to the table and have no chemistry with Lucas and Brooke, and the Haley on tour bit was ludicrous even as this show goes. Thank God for Jake and Peyton, by far the best part of this season."
1,Very disappointing,"A very disappointing effort from such a distinguished intellectual. I was expecting a hard-nosed, rigorous analysis on the order of Michael Walzer's ""Just and Unjust Wars"" (a work which, amazingly, does not appear in the bibliography). Instead, we get an armchair attempt at history that leads to a series of preconceived notions never seriously subjected to critical inquiry. It is a complex problem, but Grayling does not fully come to grips with it."
5,"10CC ""Meanwhile""",Just an update. This CD has been re-released by UK's 7T's Cherry Red labelWith 5 bonus tracks. I got mine from Cd Imports in Irvine Ca. They cell on this site. So go get it.
5,Don't even think about NOT buying this!,"If you are any degree of Dave Chappelle fan, you need this. Who else can pull off being hilarious and serious at the same time so well? You'll learn about how he got into being a comedian and why he quit Chappelle's Show, etc... It's not at all your average ""I got made fun of a lot in high school, but I wasn't going to let it bother me! I just reached for the stars!"" crap! JUST BUY IT!!"
2,Swiss Gear Sling Pack,"Nice bag with flashing neon light for those night time bike rides. Lots of pockets and fits comfortably. Don't forget to pick up some Wd40 because you will need it. The zippers really suck, literally. They don't move easily, and even with the WD40 I don't expect the bag to hold out much longer even though I just bought it. Don't waste your money because sending it back for a refund costs more than it is worth. ~friendlyskeptic"
5,Cesars the man!,"Flicking through the channels, I came across this guy. To me, this man is 7 feet tall and in full control of every inch.The physical truth is that he is not so grand in physical stature yet his presence of confidence and the way he brings 100% of himself leaves no confusion as to why he is leader of the pack!"
4,Our dog is great,We purchased this after we took on the responsibility of a rather large dog our daughter could no longer care for. We decided if we were going to have a dog (no matter what size) it would be obdient. These dvd's are so helpful and we are so proud of our dog. We walk her and so many people make comments about her behavior and of course we tell them about the Dog Whisperer DVD's. Consistency is the key. The only issue we have is trying to find solutions to problems we don't feel are covered in the DVD's. Our dog has seperation anxiety and does not like storms so for these problem we crate her. Wish we could leave her loose in the house when we are gone but so far can't do that. Storms freak her out so if we are aware of a coming storm we crate her.
1,Someone should teach Cesar a lesson!,"I'm a certificated Behavioral Therapist for Dogs from The Netherlands. I had to rate this show with 1 star in order to be able to comment on it, but I think 1 star is too much.I watched Cesar's show several times on TV. I think his methods are very old fashioned. Why use corrections if you can teach dogs things in a positive and non-threatening way.The Dutch association of Behavioral Therapists has officially protested against the broadcasting of Cesar's show.Cesar should watch Victoria Stilwell's show. She teaches dogs and owners how to deal with problems in a positive and ethological way."
1,no sound,"I purchased this video because I need help with an aggressive chihuahua I recently adopted. Much to my chagrin, there is no audio. The volume is so low I cannot hear the episode just inches from my pc.So much for this being a good resource."
3,Women in Prison Litebox,"I'm not an expert on women in prison movies, or anything for that matter, but I have seen a lot of WIP flicks, and I would not rate these high on my replay list, it's a great set in presentation, and has some good trailers and interviews, bonus features, but the films themselves Women in Fury, and Violence in a Women's Prison are both Italian directed and from the 70's and they somehow manage to take a lot of the fun out of the women in prison scenario, as with a lot of Italian films from this era they take themselves to seriously and the directors are trying to make dramatic ""high art"" not camp or even titillation really, especially in the case of Violence in a Womens Prison. Dead Riot is a newer straight to video flick that is right campy and fun."
5,PAY ATTENTION!!,"This is truly a thought provoking movie that you need to PAY ATTENTION TO....think about it...he goes to a class to learn how to write his ""Journal"" and he really dos not know WHO he really is...just WHAT he is..his job, his possessions,etc...he starts thinking about his life, and he realizes that all the people surrounding him..at work,etc...are the same way..no ethics,no morality,no compassion,just concerned about making the big bucks regardless of having to lie,cheat,etc to get that...Going to the class makes Ben start thinking about what IS really important in life. WATCH IT . GREAT MOVIE !!"
3,Ski trip to Italy...,"Some interesting insights but a whole lot of bad hyperbole and attempts to be cute. How come no one mentioned the escape from Val d'Isere, France by skis, at night, 10 miles in ""my mid forties."" That was the tiebreaker. Ouch."
2,"Beware, it gets hot and is about as heavy as the laptop.","I am having great luck with the second one I ordered after the first one burnt out shortly after receiving it. When I called the Amazon retailer about returning the first one, I was told I waited too long, (about 95 days). In hindsight I would have paid more for the HP replacement and been better off, had I known."
4,Mild workout,"I've greatly enjoyed Kari Anderson's DVD's and always finish drenched in sweat and with a feeling of satisfaction after a whole-body workout. This DVD was a bit of a disappointment because it's a relatively mild workout when compared to some of the other Kari Anderson DVDs, such as ""Center Floor"" or ""Reach"". It lasts about 45 minutes and combines easy and intermediate pilates and yoga exercises. Though it wasn't what I expected, I think it would be a great start if you are a beginner. I would also recommend it for a ""rest"" day in between harder workouts because it does involve a lot of stretching, which is always good for sore muscles! Overall, I'll continue to use it, but not for when I need a higher impact workout."
2,SoccerEdge Review,"Bungee cord snapped in two, 20 minutes after setup. I tried to re-tie the cord, but it only snapped again. Not satisfied at all with this product as a training device."
4,The Trouble With Valentine's Day,Love is hard to know for sure when two people seem to only lust after one another. A broken marriage can make one unsure if lust is enough to make one try again. Happy endings.
5,The Blues meets Folk meets Country meets...,"Keb' Mo' is simply one of the best ""new"" artists to come along in years. He kicked around the studios for awhile before making this recording. Close your eyes and it sounds as if this young man is already in his sixties, both by the quality of his voice and the experience of his playing. ""Am I Wrong?"" is one of the best blues tunes I've ever heard! You won't regret buying this CD!"
5,Wonderful CF,I recently bought this CD on Amazon and have listened to it many times now. Keb Mo has a truly unique voice and sound. This album is fast becoming on of my favorites! Thank you Amazon for the great product and speedy service. I highly recommend Keb Mo and Amazon.com!!!
1,Nothing to it,This DVD is a waste of money. It is simply a few exercises such as jumping rope and a few others. That is all. Not worth even one dollar.
4,Awesome,When I was at a science camp we made these and they were so much fun. We played with them on the floor for the rest of the day. The only downside is that it is very delicate and the propeller brakes easily. Mine broke and we superglued it back together. It broke again later. Even after we hot gluegunned it. I was 10 and i'm sure any 10-12 year old would love this!
4,Educational Thrill,"Everyone in my class just loved my hovercraft project. I demonstrated Newton's Laws. The craft was a little challenging to build but I figure it taught me more that way. Overall, this hovercraft is AWSOME! I'm sure this kit will help me in some way in the future.-Tildy"
1,Why grammar is SO important.,"I suppose the editor is to blame for my gripe. The grammar is this book is atrocious. I'm already at a disadvantage with my limited exposure to SQL Server 2000. I'm finding myself constantly re-reading paragraphs because of incorrect sentence structure and word tense. It makes reading so much faster and easier when the author/editor/publisher can put a damn sentence together. (...)I managed to pass the first three MCSE exams using a different series of books. I decided to try Syngress after reading some fairly positive things about the series. So far, I'm regretting my decision. I will push on and try to make it through, but it's been 3 days and I'm only on chapter 5! I managed to finish my previous readings in 3 days (as many as 15 chapters!). If I don't pass this exam - I will be adding to this review..."
5,Authentic Recipes..with great photography,"As a Sicilian growing up with a large Italian family in Brooklyn, this book had many traditional recipes. As the older generations are gone..so are their recipes..this book brought them back to me. Christmas Eve - the traditional Fish Feast was fabulous in this book. The photography and layout is very good. I also enjoyed the brief history he includes with the holiday and food. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this book."
4,L'air du Temps Body Creme,"I have worn this fragrance for years and am very happy with it. That said, I prefer the body lotion as shown in the picture above. I received Body Creme in a jar. It was the same size as the lotion but not as portable. It would be very helpful if the pictures shown would match the product ordered."
2,think twice!,"This product had decent flavor but the consistentcy was like overcooked pasta, very rubbery. If you can live with that I think it is a passable alternative to regular pasta."
1,Awful,This is not worth the money. Worse product I have ever eaten. I would not recommend or order this item again..........Had to throw it away along with the other bag i had bought. Very disappointing.
1,UGH!,"I had read about this product in several magazines and was anxious to try it - but after the smell and the first bite, I had to toss it. The smell when you first open the package is nasty but goes away after much rinsing and parboiling. The ultimate gross out though was the texture - just not what I am expecting from a pasta."
1,Compelling subject matter -- poorly written,"The subject matter is indeed compelling, but the writing of this story is extremely dull. The first rule of writing is to SHOW your reader what's happening, and if you're lucky, you'll evoke emotions in your readers and they'll grow attached to your characters. In this book, Styple tells (instead of shows) and then proceeds to tell you how to feel at the same time. There is some incredible civil war literature out there, including Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier and The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All by Allan Gurganus. I recommend skipping this one, and reading another instead."
4,Spellbound,Sabrina's lonely. Harvey's away to Europe with his Mum + Dad and Libby's flanting it in France.So her aunts zap a counselor résumé that makes her sound brilliant.

3,more like shoes really,"My problem with these sandals is that there is so much material they are more like open toed shoes than true sandals. Also, I find it very uncomfortable to wear these without socks.Comfort issues aside, they are fine."
3,sandals,"The older model of these shoes was fabulous. I am hoping the same type of comfort and performance from this ""next gen"" version."
3,More than cheerleading movie,"Bring it on isn't some masterpiece but it was cute and enjoyable. It wasn't as cheesy as some others out there and I could actually watch it from beginning to end without hanging myself with teen movie cliches. It's nice to see not all movies geared toward teenagers are ""popular boy meets unpopular girls, does or says something stupid, girl gets mad, boy gets girl"" The end. It's a good story and everyone- Kirsten Dunst especially just rocked on teh screen. Rent or buy, you wont regret it."
2,It was better in the 90's...,"On a trip to Ocean City MD recently, a band covered the song ""Farewell Jamaica"". My boyfriend remembered the song as being sung by Harry Belafonte, but I had never heard that version - I'd only heard Sebastian sing it on a Little Mermaid cassette I had when I was younger! Immediately I turned to Amazon to try to find it. What I found was this CD... it's about 5 or so tracks short of the cassette I remember listening to when I was little. Sometimes I don't know why Disney does the things they do... maybe they'll re-release the other 5 tracks on a CD that you can buy separately from this one so they can make double their money. I will tell you these songs aren't terrible - I remember I got it for my 5th birthday and the songs are still etched in my memory - so that tells you I loved them. But I am very disappointed that Disney chopped this compilation down."
5,"Well, Obviously it Gets Five Stars!","Why bother rating classic early material by the Isleys? Their unequaled brilliance elevates them far above the scale. They rocked us in the 1950's and 60's, grooved us in the 1970s and 80s, and we fell in love with them all over again in the 1990s and today. Listeners should get their 3-CD box set, but this disc of ballads is also a worthy alternative, even if the collection isn't as comprehensive as it could have been. ""Let's Fall in Love,"" ""Hello, It's Me,"" and ""You're Beside Me"" are brimming with the tendermess, warmth, and soul that's so desperately lacking in much of modern r&b. ""Beautiful Ballads"" is a sure-fire way to help create that special mood on that romantic evening with the special somebody you're with. While they're still churning out hit records and teaming up with modern collaborators such as R.Kelly, nothing can compare to their early work as summarized on this disc. A record collection without the Isley Brothers is no record collection at all."
5,A legend at the height of his powers!!!,"This video reminds you why Weird Al has been so popular for so long. One of the few touchstones of comedy that can be passed from a father to a son, and be loved by both."
1,The Fink Stinks,"Admired the man and his art, however, this movie isn't terribly illuminating. It has the quality of a high school film project."
2,Fits: Yes and No,"The lighter works just find. The problem is it's too long for the ashtray to close.The selection criteria give the results: ""This product fits your 2000 Chevrolet S10 Fitment Notes: LONG""""Long"" must refer to the handle length. There is another lighter with ""Fitment Notes: Short""Probably a better choice. I'll see if I can swap for it.I have a 2000 S10 Ext. Cab with the LS Trim."
4,Awesome product,"Love this stuff come off with warm water and gets all the hair off, will be only using this from now on. This product is great for hair removal and easy to use. It is good for skin. Easy to wash. Not only removes hair but also good for removing dead cells and blackheads. Proper waxing process gives a smooth and clean skin."
2,Different silicon inside - Don't buy,"I was impressed with the previous 2Gig transcend model 110. I bought this one, thinking that it was going to be just as quick.I was wrong. It is horrible with writes. 8GB models are a different technology from the 2Gigs models and probably the 4GB, too.I am going to stick with SanDisk 4GB Titanium until I can find a review showing that 8GB devices are worthy. I think Transcend is a fine company, but they release leading edge products that should remain in the Q&A; labs.I will call them and see if I can get a replacement or credit."
4,Pretty good buy for the price,"This product is exactly what you would expect for the price. It definitely works, but its a little slow. However, given the price - doesn't bother me very much. Great buy."
2,"Boy, is this thing slow...","It's excruciatingly slow. I probably should have sent it back, but I told myself ""what the heck - you're not in that big a hurry, right?"" Well, maybe I am after all. On the plus side, it does work and has been reliable to far. On the minus side, it doesn't work very fast. And the problem doesn't appear to have anything to do with Windows, either - I use the current version of OSX on a Mac."
5,Works Great!,"When I review flash drives I only have one real criteria - does it work? I am happy to report that the Transcend JetFlash works as well any Flashdrive that I have used. However, a few other observations -- Write speeds - more than adequate - I was able to transfer a 600meg file in less than a minute- Not important to me, but others ay like the fact that there is a place to tie a string/keychain. Some people like to have a means to attach their flash drive to their body/backpack/significant other... the Transcend JetFlash will work for that!- The USB connector is retractable - again not a big deal for me- but rest assured the Transcend JetFlash is fully retractableFinal verdict - Not much to complain about - it will hold 7.6G of data and write at pretty decent speeds.5 Stars"
5,Ages 4-8? Should be 4 to 80!,"An excellent collection of poems about winter - the joys and woes. A favorite is the poem by the same title, Winter Eyes. Rich language and stunning imagery in a deceptively simple form. I'm sending it to my mother, who recently left Minnesota for New Mexico, she can always have the best of winter with this book."
1,it is all about the money... for kevin too!,"I believe that there is some truth in this book, but i can not help feeling taken for a ride when in fact there is no usuable information in the book and he pounds in HIS ""pay-for-view"" website. If he really believes in the cooruption that he talks about in the book, then why all the hype in ""paying"" for more infomation? If he is really interested in ""curing the illnesses of the world"" then he should be sharing this infomation for free! I bought the book for insight and direction on helping myself and other i care for... not to turn around and pay more money to get the infomation that the book claims it is sharing with me on the inside cover and back! try again kevin! i won't be so ready to fall for this one twice."
1,STEAMING PILE OF SEWAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,SOME JERKS OUT THERE ARE MAKING A CONCERTED EFFORTTO HYPE THIS BOOK WITH NOTHING BUT 5 STAR REVIEWSWHOEVER YOU ARE:GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth the money,"This book is an obvious money making scheme. He really doesn't say anything new, and much of it is actually false (or at best misleading and illogical.) There were a bunch of typos which I find scary coming from someone giving me medical advice. There are WAY better books on natural cures than this one, and they cost less and teach more. Don't bother."
1,Federal Court Finds Kevin Trudeau in Civil Contempt,"On June 29, 2004, a U.S. District Court judge found Kevin Trudeau in contempt of court for violating a July 2003 stipulated preliminary injunction. The Court found that Trudeau violated the preliminary injunction when he disseminated direct mail pieces and an infomercial that made claims that coral calcium is an effective treatment or cure for cancer and other diseases. The preliminary injunction prohibited Trudeau from making these claims. The Court ordered that Trudeau cease all marketing of coral calcium and expressly reserved the right to impose additional remedial measures.In June 2003, the Federal Trade Commission charged that Trudeau and others made false and unsubstantiated claims in an infomercial that coral calcium cures or treats cancer and other diseases.Anybody that says this is a good book is most likely working for Trudeau."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"My niece purchased this book expecting it to guide her in making choices leading to a healthy lifestyle. What lies between the covers does not align with the promises from its author. The television informational promoting the book leads the viewer to believe it reveals useful alternatives to drugs and other medical treatments. There are no suggestions for the average person who does not want to resort to excessive high colonics and other well-known, but outlandish, treatments. I advised my niece to return the book and seek a refund because she had been duped."
1,1 Star: Too Generous,"I don't want to repeat the other reviews. I hate to know how many trees were destroyed for printing this publication. Even if it was printed on recycled paper, the paper was better off where it came from."
4,I am convinced,"After reading the chapter ""Still Not Convinced"" in this book, I am totally convinced that this is one of the best resources for other reference books on subjects covered in this book. Why take just one author's views of the issue? I'm an avid reader and usually appreciate a second or third viewpoint or opinion.""Still not convinced"" shows how many other authors and alternative health care practioners there are out there trying to change the system. My congratulations to Kevin Trudeau for a great read."
1,Beware of this SCAM,"I bought this book and realized it is a complete scam. The author reveals no natural cures in the book. After you buy it, he refers you to his website where you must be a monthly fee in order to get the promised information. Furthermore, the author claims that he can't provide cures in his book. That is a lie. As long as you have a disclaimer, you can - and other books do.The author writes many stories about things that have happened to try to support his conspiracy theories, but provides NO footnotes or references. I have emailed him and his website about this but nobody will respond to me.The only thing he really says in the book is that you should eat healthy (which everybody knows) and eat organic food. If you feel comfortable paying the author for all the information contained in my previous sentance then that is your prerogative."
2,No magic bullet,"I have seen the info-commercial twice and agree this man is a great salesman but after reading a friend's copy, I have to say this is no Hidden causes of Heart Attack and Stroke which had a similar theme, but is actually loaded with real lifesaving information. Sorry but there are no magic bullets - no one cure for everything."
1,False Advertising,I returned this book because it was not at all what it claimed to be. I found very little of the promised natural cures and more whining about big business and claims of dishonesty among large drug companies.
1,Completely bogus,"Unfortunately, this book is completely bogus and believing the nonsense this person writes could seriously endanger your health. While the big pharma are no cuddly puppies, this book's author appears to be worse - he is selling absolute lies coated in scientific mambo-jambo. I'm a biologist, and there are sentences in this book that make no scientific sense; yet they use scientific terms to sound convincing. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Toxic Tirades,"Okay. If you're patient enough to wade through way too many rants against the government and big biz, you'll find some ideas that might help you become healthier. This book probably could've been written in 100 pages or less if Trudeau had stuck to the title's subject matter. Instead, it reads like the infomercial from hell.The reason I give it a 2-star rating is because there actually are some good ideas. Unfortunately, he doesn't cite any clinical medical studies to back up his opinions. There's not even an index in the back of the book. Trudeau also charges a pretty hefty fee on his web site while hiding behind the FTC in order to get what you thought you were going to get when you bought the book in the first place. Grrrrrrhhhhhh! But it's pretty slick when you think about it. I bet his bank account is getting healthier by the minute."
3,This is a start to good health.,"I bought this book beacuse I am trying to live healthy. I am a registered nurse so I have a working knowledge of medicine. If you are looking for a ""cure"" for something don't buy it. If you are trying to live healthy find a holistic Dr. to oversee your care and use some of the tips he/she gives. I did not subscribe to the website. It is disappointing that he constantly refers you to it for information.If you want to continue smoking, overeating, and keep your stress filled life DON'T waste your money on this or any other book about health. If you want to change - the book is a start.He talks about chemotherapy, antidepressants, cholesteral lowering medications. I AGREE with a lot of his information on these drugs. I personally would not take most of these medications. Our foods are LOADED with chemicals (another point he stresses.So, take your head out of the sand and get healthy. If this book is not for you find one about natural healing. You will feel better."
4,This book really led me to reevaluate,I want to thank you Mr. Trudeau for your thoughts on how Tampons can lead to urinary tract infections and even cancer. I've been using them ever since I first got my period and making the switch to cheesecloth pads that your book recommends was not easy for me. Now I love them and also have the peace of mind that my future children will be cancer free. Thank you so much for this revealing knowledge.
1,I should have checked here first,"I get this on impulse without coming here first to read the reviews so I, too, got ripped off. This book just give broad, vague suggestions and requires that you go spend even more money getting an online membership to get what you were hoping to get from the book. What a racket! There are other books on the market that give good information on the pharmaceutical industry without asking for additional money, so please consider those instead of this one."
2,Disappointed,"The author says that the FDA will not let herbs become drugs because it's all about the money. The drug companies wouldn't make enough. I was hoping to understand what natural cures went with specific diseases. Instead, all I got was what not to eat and to eat organic. It gives a website that promotes the book. On this website I can pay $9.95 a month to find the natural cures that I desired to learn about in the first place. I guess it is all about the money!!!"
1,NEGATIVE 5 QUADRILLION STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I highly recommend this book.It's greatfor scooping up trash and gum.It also burns well too, when its cold out!!"
5,Educated consumer,"I'm a much more educated consumer now that I've read Natural Cures. I'm thankful to the author who really puts this in your face. He repeats himself but I finally figured out that that's because he really wants his readers to get the point. Well, I got the point. Thank you for being so persistent."
1,Natural Cures,"This book is a waste of money. The author makes claims but does not supply facts or evidence to support his claims. Nor does he provide names or products of natural cures. He refers you to his web site. At the web site, you are asked to join for a fee to receive the alleged information. This is a con. Note: I wanted no stars, web site did not allow."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The author wastes most of the print in this book as well as the sequel to explaining in great detail about how the government and big business is in cahoots with the large drug companies. The point is well taken but needs to be stated only once. Again and again throughout the books Trudeau repeats the same messages. The books would be phamplets if not for the repetition.I say ""don't waste your money on these hyped diatribes of baloney"""
1,Very VERY Odd.....,"I Find it Very Odd how all these 5-Star Positive Reviews where written in the same day. I wish I had access to the actual times they were posted to see how close together they were done. I looked at this book's reviews just last month and almost everyone said to avoid it and don't waste Your Money. But today I look and almost all the Reviews are 5-Star and posted on the same day. You know what, I'm not buying it... in more ways than one. Here's a Hint, just click on the name of Every Reviewer that just gave it a 5-Star Rating in the last day and You will find that they all have one thing in common... this is the ONLY Book they have Reviewed - ever! It leaves Me to Strongly Believe that this mass of recent reviews is Totally Bogus, and I wouldn't be surprised it they all originated from the exact same IP Address. Think about it, and don't be a fool."
1,RIP OFF! Do not buy!,"In short: this writer claims that this book will tell the reader natural remedies for various ailments (including cancer), when in fact all it does is apologize & claims that the FDA FORCES him to omit the info in this book. However, if you would like to subscribe to his on-line webzine for ""x"" dollars more *per month*, he promises to share it with you.I was never SO angry regarding the lack of content from a book in my life."
5,Thank You Kevin!,"Hi Everybody, I'm just writing in to tell you how pleased I am with this book. I just got back from an Acapulco vacation with my husband, which got off to a really bad start until Kevin saved the day! We made the mistake of ordering a salad with lunch at this cute little cafe and boy did Montezuma have his revenge on us! Thankfully, I had brought Kevin's great new book along to read on the beach and we followed his advice to administer a baking soda and vinegar enema. Boy were we surprised!Thank You!"
1,A very misleading book...,"Well, if you ever heard the phrase, ""Don't judge a book by its cover,"" you'll get this review. :-) The book's title, it's description, it's stated aim, its entire preface... all of them are misleading. In reality, most of this book is a rant about the US government and the practices of corporations, all on the theory that you need to be put into the mindset to receive the information that you bought the book for. There is very little truly useful information in this book itself, with the real advice being either on the website or advice you could have easily pursued without needing to read the book: go to a nutritionist and pursue other avenues of holistic medicine rather than rely on synthetic drugs and surgery, where possible. You could possibly fill up a pamphlet with the truly useful information given that there are references for other places to look, other people to contact, but the rest of the 572 pages of the book are basically just a rant used as filler."
2,Crazy Head,"I had to stop reading this book after a hundred pages due to his incessant referencing to ""magical energy"" that ""creates"" toxins in your body. Also, he rambles on and on. There are typos in the book. I don't think he even had it editied. He just rambled like a crazy person. The paragraphs are not divided by logical breaks. At one point he says ""let's get to the specifics on such and such"" and then proceeds to ramble on and on about the same old stuff.It's a shame he's crazy because some of his stuff makes some sense. However, the whole book is an advertisement to get you to go on his website which has a $10/mo or $400/life membership fee.Also, look at him. If he believed in the stuff he does, he wouldn't look like that. He wouldn't put on make up or wear deodorant or put gel or creams in his hair. Crazy guy."
1,rip-off,"In order to feel as if this book was the real thing, you would have to move to the country, with no one around you for miles, no electricity, phone, and city water. You would have to grow your own food and hope that your well water was pure. That is the way that book made me feel.And when reading the book, it would get you to a certain place and in order to understand what it was talking about, you would have to go to his web-site and pay 9.95 a month to find out what he was talking about. His web-site was mentioned in every paragraph.He is making money hand over fist on our ignorance. Any one who buys into this deserves to lose their hard earned cash. No wonder the FTC is on him so hard. The FDA, federal goverment, and the IRS should do the same."
1,"""AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL YOU EITHER""","I too wish I had read the Amazon.com reviews first. If you want a book that talks almost entirely about the greedy pharmaceutical and medical industries and about the FDA then buy the book. If you think your were buying a book about Natural Cures, your wrong! The name of the book should have been ""Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About and I'm not allowed to tell you either"". Throughout the book is disclaimers about what he is about to tell you but when he tells you that there is a cure for a disease (herb,tea,etc.)he then says the FDA won't allow him to mention it in the book. He also refers you to his website so that you can become a member ($$$!)so that he can tell you what he didn't tell you in this book. He should have been ""upfront"" in the title of his book and on the paid talk shows that he was not allowed to tell you the actual names of the cures in his book. I hope someone reads this review before deciding to purchase the book."
1,Quack,"The book is essentially his own infomercial so you buy other books and products. This guy is a convicted felon and a con man and has been for years. He backs nothing up, has no proof just spews his ideas as facts. And he makes money doing it. That my friends is the definition of a con man. It's sad that he is not rotting in jail. Save your money. I bought this book before I knew his background. I read it and said it was weak in many areas and didnt have any references. Then i did a search and found out all about this guy."
3,Scam Buster,"I just ordered the book and kit that goes with it. This is the newest version. However, I feel good about it because I am also getting a $50 gift certificate from a well-known department store. The gift certificate more than cancels out the cost of the book/kit, so it is like I'm getting this information, whether I agree with it or not, for FREE!Deloris Patterson"
1,BEWARE !!,"Although this book has some good ideas concerning health care today I find the author mostly Bogus and out to get as much of your money as he possibly can.After reading this book I realized I already do 75% of the things Mr. Trudeau suggest I do, so I guess the last 25% is what's going to kill me or at least keep me from living 200 yearsI can buy news letters and get information on how to lose 30 pounds in 30 days all at a nominal monthly fee,I can be sent to different web pages so they too can have some of my money.And if that isn't enough, you will soon be receiving a letter(after you order this book) about how the Nouveau Tech Societyneeds you to join them because of you special traits. Mine are so special not even I know what they are.Gee... I lived almost 50 years and now someone finally noticed I have special traits! Save your money folks! This book ain't worth it."
1,What a Rip-Off!,"I purchased this book after viewing the ""infomercial"" and was excited for it to arrive. When it DID arrive, I couldn't have been more disappointed. There was literally no information in the book, other than instruction to pay to subscribe to the author's web site. I can't believe that this person gets away with this!"
5,"Natural Cures"" they don't want you to Know about""","I found the book to be interesting and the information useful, overwhelming at best,in reading the first few chaperts. It has challenged me on making the necessity changes for better health I felt needed. Keven Trudeau spoke out! thats great for the consumers,(I applaud him for the information) joining the web-site mentioned in the book- will get you the needed information that you read about turning the pages in the book for a fee. So whats better reading the book and then joining the site...thats something you will have to deside.....for a monthly fee"
4,did you guys read the whole book???,"you're giving a very bad impression of this book that actually has a lot of information that a lot of people don't know about. sounds like you work for the FTC. hmmm. it's possible he's just trying to get people to subscribe, but it doesn't negate the fact that everything in there is true. he cites article after article and book after book to back it up. he also states that they are ""suggestions."" there are no medical facts. MDs state everything as fact. how do they know??? oh, right, because they went to medical school. we all have our own minds; let's use them."
1,Cash Cow,"This self-appointed health guru brings no new information to the table, rather rewords already well-known facts. Plus, he sure doesn't go out of his way to give you the ""natural cures"" he speaks so highly of unless you go to his website and pay for it. What a crock. Even those who have the most basic knowledge of nutrition will feel like their intelligence has been insulted after reading this book. Keep your money."
1,Kevin Trudeau: Scam-Artist Extradinaire!!,"Why is Amazon aiding this scammer by offering this piece of crap on its website?!! If this ""IDIOT"" truly had a cure for cancer, heart disease & diabetes. Why is he on TV at 4:30am talking jibberish & hocking this useless piece of garbage??? To take your money, that's why!!"
4,"Natural Cures ""They"" Do Not Want You to Know About",I think there is something to his theories. Health wise I'm sure you could do well by following all his advise but there are so many people who cannot afford some of the cures. I think he should stress juicing of raw vegetables a little more for those that can only afford food. It would be a great place to start to cure yourself and then if you have funds left over go for his other treatment recommendations.
1,This WILL NOT help you progress in any way!!!,"Ask around before Buying. Also, after they process your debit card you will be prompt over to other business scams as well. If he is here for you to cut down your debt, why do they as debit or CREDIT? Don't make sense. After paying with credit cards you once again looses money. I was told not to buy from this guy but I refused to listen.. $50.00 gone down the drain. Saying that the book was only 19.95 but why they charge almost $30.00 for shipping and handling!!!"
5,A starting point to a more perfect world,"In a perfect world we wouldn't use drugs to heal our bodies our libraries would be full of all books so anyone could read and learn about healing. But that is not the case. I am glad we have a book like this to help many people learn more about what is going on with the food industry and the lack of real nutrition going on. I feel this book is just a starting point for many to learn about options. To get more hard cold info on the many things there are so many other avenues to take that are mentioned, especially since there is so much censorship of this man, his hands have been very tied by the government. Look at this as great big first step to realizing good health."
1,False claims,"This guy truly does not care of your health, but your money! I saw his talk about the book on TV and was surprised with his advices that he gave, i.e. his claim: Microwave is bad for your health. I wonder - can he prove that heating food with microwave can be bad for your health? If so, what is the scientific evidence? This guy seriously needs to take a class of BASIC PHYSICS.I briefly scanned his book at Barnes and Noble - it really has serious false claims - i do hope no body follows his advices."
3,Some Info...,"After doing a little research, and reading he didn't put actual cures in the book but could have, I quickly found that isn't true. He CAN'T...[...]The information includes the following statement:In addition, Trudeau cannot make disease or health benefits claims for any type of product, service, or program in any advertising, including print, radio, Internet, television, and direct mail solicitations, regardless of the format and duration.If this means the rest of the book is true, I wouldn't know & have no comment..."
2,Long winded,"There is some useful information in this book if you can get past the long winded talk. He repeats himself quite often. A lot of ""if you don't believe me then look at these examples""stuff. Too much jiberish for my taste. I will not be buying any more of his books. I am totally into natural living but this is a bit extreme even for me."
1,Is this for Real????????,To Follow All THe Advice Of This Author. You Would Have to Live The Rest of You're Life In a PLASTIC BUBBLE. This guy should be arrested for writing this B.S. and ripping buyers off.
1,Please save your money,"This book has nothing but references to Kevins website for additional info, info you have to pay for.His infomercials are deceptive stating you get free gifts, yet when you go to order you are told you MUST have a subscription to his newsletter for $71.40 a year to get them.I advise everyone to please go to the better business bureau and do a check on his Shop America Company. They are listed as Shop America in Elk Grove Village IL. He has an unsatisfactory record with them and 422 complaints so far ranging from advertising issues to credit/billing issues with the majority of complaints dealing with refunds promised. I guess that means good luck getting your money back if you're not satisfied. So much for that 30 day unconditional guarantee!"
1,Dross: And don't let a gullible person read this!,"My wife wants to have her filling pulled because this idiot says so.Why do I call him an idiot. Here are two examples.Coral Calcium: he says a goverment agency won't let him publish anything about it--so he refers you to his website where you can find out more if you subscribe! Hey, Kevy, there are no apriori restraints on the press in the USA.Pigs: He says you should not eat pork because pigs eat thier own excretement. He thinks that is disgusting, thus not healthy. Well pigs and rabbits can eat their own. There may be many reasons not to eat pork, especially in third world countries. but Kevy sure didn't bother to research them.Why do research when you can make up a stupid reason.Given his pork logic I'm surprised he doesn't say not to eat anything organic as the compost used to grow things contains animal excrement."
1,useless info,"About 95% of this book talks about the FDA and the FTC and how bogus they are. I bought the book for the cures. What a joke, this guy is the one who is bogus. He is a ""researcher"", All he has done is take info from other people and tell you what other books to buy to get this info. The cures he has given are easily found on the internet or by your Doctor, such as acidophilis for good intestinal health. Thats been known for many years, who does not want us to know about that? It is sold in any store in America. Anyway dont waste your money, there is nothing in this book that you cant find out for free somewhere else."
1,waste of money....,"I bought this book for my boyfriend rather than wait for it for free from the LIbray. What a WASTE!! I didn't learn ANYTHING! He keeps saying ""do this and do that"" but doesn't tell you HOW to do it unless you go to his web site and pay more money! You would think he would at least give you a free 1 week trial to the web site if you bought the book. I wish I had read the reviews first! (but I am a nice girlfriend and didn't bother!)He says that Psychogists are a waste of time and money and recomends a book, which can't be bought unless it is a ""special order"" and then doesn't really TELL You why you shouldn't go to them anyway. He says he isn't in it for ""the money"" but yet he himself admits he lives a ""VERY NICE lifestlye"". If it isn't about the money, then how about giving some of his money back and charging LESS for his web site or nothign at all, and put his earnings to pay ""the cost of running the web site"". I also understand why the FTC wants to shut him down - HE IS A QUACK!"
1,Pure Crapola!,This criminal author just likes to hear himself talk. There is nothing in this book of any value or use. Save your dough gang!
5,"Cleansing & PH, very interesting","I have heard a lot of about ""cleansing"" and though it was a bunch of new-age rubbish. Yeah, yeah I thought. A friend of mine was suffering from some seriousIssues with weird aches and pains which turned out to be serious problems caused by pesticides which she had been working with on the farm all her life. She had these cleansing things in the book and her symptoms disappeared. Amazing. So I looked into this a bit more and found it a very valid thing. I think this is a good example of things in the book which you think on the surface are just hype until you try it yourself and see the results.I am a firm believer in good old common sense. This book has a lot of that in it.I am looking forward to reading and investigating further with the help of this book."
2,Some good tips!,"Most part of this book falls apart for it natural weight.Luckily, there are also some good advice for us.Tseck this before you gonna buy it!"
1,Nice door stopper,It's literally sitting on the table collecting dust. I read through the first three chapters and realized that this guy would use the most insignificant and insane thread of evidence to support his claim and rebuke the established institutions. And try those remedies he mentioned at your own risk.
4,This is better than the weight book.,"Cancer is not caused by one factor except in unusual cases such as nuclear exposure. It is a lifetime of accumulation of all the preservatives and other chemicals in our life over time. There is a lot of misinformation out there about cholesterol, avoiding red meat, avoiding eggs and other dairy products. Many people on an all meat diet have lived into their 90's. There should be moderation in all things. Not a bunch of ridiculous fads that are later proven to be completely wrong. Such as the over use of Statins and too much anti-anxiety medications. Above all, it should be against the law to advertise any prescription drugs on T.V. or the internet. That should be a complete No, No."
1,See this before you buy.,"If you are considering this book, please check this website first. http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htm"
1,Let me save you some money,"How do you keep from getting sick?Become a Scientologist. Yup, he recommends this.Don't watch the news. It makes you sad.Don't read newspapers. Forget keeping up with the real world.Get a massage. Well, that's not too bad.Get a deep tissues massage. A couple times a month. No one said this would be cheap.Bioenergetic synchronization. Don't you feel better just reading that?There's 104 other steps to never getting sick again. Honestly, reading them made me sick. I'll take the snake oil, thanks."
1,Who cares anyway?,"Who cares about this book that's about curing people. Just go to the doctor, there is a medicane for everything these days no one needs a stupid book to tell us how to cure us just go to the gas station and ask them were the hospital is. Geez."
1,Wasted time,"This book is a self promotion of Mr. Trudeau. He refers you to his paying website for any cures so it is basically a saga of how the FDA has come after him and an explanation of why he can't give you any ""Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About""!!!"
1,This is a terrible book!,"I am kicking myself for buying this before I read the Amazon reviews. Kevin Trudeau spends most of the book accusing different organizations of fraud and conspiracy. He writes that all prescription and non-prescription drugs are poison. Keep in mind that Mr. Trudeau is a Scientologist, and has no medical training. He blames most of the death in Americans on doctors and recommends that patients should seek holistic healers for depression, cancer, and most other ailments. There are pages and pages of newspaper headlines to lure in and scare the public. I would love to see a book where Kevin Trudeau provides proof for his accusations and recommendations."
1,Save Your Money!,"After reading the first 1/3 of this book and being told of all the toxins everybody puts in their body by taking a shower and consuming all types of FDA approved foods, I was finally given some wonderful (???) ideas of how to rid myself of these poisons, but only after going to Trudeau's website where he will give me ""all"" the needed insights for only [...] per month. Of course, he isn't ""selling"" a product like others of his ilk (except his book and his website). Save your money, eat sensibly and exercise regularly and live life fully (Also, read the Chicago Tribune article of August 30, 2005 about Trudeau and his checkered past as a [...] artist)"
1,Lining His Pockets With Lies,"Another compilation of self-serving scams from the convict, Kevin Trudeau. He manages to just barely stay within the bounds of his recent fraud conviction in this book, but it is still unsubstantiated hogwash. Conveniently, only Kevin himself can provide you with the further information and treatments that have eluded thousands of physicians and researches from hundreds of nations. Funny. It is amazing how someone can be so totally discredited professionally and legally and still sell tons of copies of the same discredited lies to a public that doesn't want to hear the inconvenient fact that there is no miracle cure.Fortunately I was able to peruse this book at the store and didn't have to shell out any cash for it. Browse it yourself before buying and see if you don't feel the same way."
5,Help for you,"I don't understand why people are upset about this book. I liked it. It reminded me of all the good apple cider vinegar does. The part that had the chart for the cures was good. Some of the things he says to use I had never heard of but I am going to see what else I can read about them. If this man is really being attacked by the government agencies like he says, well all I can say is shame on them. Mr. Trudeau is just trying to help people."
1,Book is a fraud written by a convicted fraudster,"This book is simply an infomercial for his pay website. While I'm not going to shell out any more money to see if his website has anything worthwhile, I can assure you that the book is complete garbage. Having since learned that this guy was convicted of credit card fraud in 1991 and was bared from selling products on TV by the FTC, I only hope that others don't fall for this fraud and waste money lining this felon's pockets."
1,A Wealth of Nothingness,"This book was nothing more than a mere tease. Tell me something I don't already know. Mr. Trudeau talked in circles about the same things, without specifically getting into details...I thought the supposed ""intent"" of the book was to offer the reader useful information. I was all excited to read about different diseases, ailments and cures for them, when all I found was a wealth of nothingness. For those who are suffering from chronic illnesses and bought into the hype of this book, expecting some real help, my heart goes out to you. If you haven't been sucked in already, please, learn from the mistakes of someone who was."
1,Snake Oil Salesman,"This guy spews out more mis-information and flat out lies than any other snake oil salesman. Dont'waste your money. There are other bona fide alternative medicine approaches available that are actully based in research and fact, as opposed to the nonsense this guy sells poor unsespecting people hurting from disease."
1,Personal agenda and paranoid ramble.,"This book is a waste of money!!!There's not too much info on Natural cures, Unless... you want to give more money for his website. It's all about those who wronged Kevin Trudeau. It is a personal agenda to get back at the FDA or whoever got in his money making ways. This is the guy that was pushing Atkins last year. (Yeah, that diet is really ""healthy"") sure it has things we all already know, processed food, diet, etc. He doesn't have very much credability in my opinion. All he wants is to get make money on all the money he has lost with his bull**** Ideas, Inventions.Save your money unless you like listening to Kevin cry about how everybody is out to get ""him"". This guy is in need of a NATURAL SHRINK!!"
1,Trudeau: always the scammer,"This book does nothing in the way of providing any hard evidence or information. Trudeau is the master of innuendo, promises, and business schemes which do little but give himself success.To to the woman who mentioned that MLM scammers were the ones disparaging this book: Um, Kevin Trudeau was himself the head of an MLM scam some years ago called Nutrition for Life. He's been at this game a long, long time.Don't waste your money, people. Natural cures are great, but they're not the answer for everything."
1,This Book was a Total Rip Off,"I bought this book based on the title which states ""Natural Cures"" and because Kevin Trudeau even goes on TV and tells people to buy this book if they want to know what the Natural Cures are, but when I bought the Book and went to the chapter for the cures, he writes he can't give us any cures because the FTC won't let him, and that his freedom of the press is not real. I am returning my book for a full refund based on false advertising. Amazon, how can you sell this book, I felt like I had been robbed"
1,"I couldn't be more disappointed, bad really bad.","Hundreds of pages of boring, poorly written, political paranoid propaganda, not a single particle of substantiated fact, endless repetition of alternative therapy potpourri where every thing works and nothing is useful.If you need to pay to be toll the obvious: that diet, exercise, hygiene, etc. are good for you and the delusional: that colonic cleanses, scientology audits, and dozens of natural cures are going to make you live for ever young, then this is your book.I didn't even new Kevin's criminal pass but the call to order and the subsequent pressure to buy several products that will be pay effortless by allowing my credit car to be automatically drain each month, gave me an idea of his company business ethics it took 20 minutes to be able to buy the book with out any of the other ""wonderful products"".One good thing: the introduction paragraph on competence."
2,Scam with a plan,"I bought this book because my father has cancer and I saw an interview and he talks about all the ways to help with cancer and other diseases. For cancer it writes and I quote ""If I had cancer I would go to a liscensed doctor."" Although I agree, I expected much more information. It also says for more or a description how to treat cancer, go to his website. I did that and he wants more money to give a treatment for cancer. This book spends all but one chapter talking about how corrupt the government is and it says the same thing 50 different ways. The book does give some remedies for other ailments, most of the time it says take Ginseng. I beleive this guy is preying on people in my situation."
1,Not even worthy of 1 star,"This is the most ridiculous book I've ever been ""duped"" into buying. There are no ""cures"" in this book. He does offer suggestions that are from common sense advice like ""eat more fruits and vegetables"" and ""exercise everyday"" to bordering on the absurd such as ""use magnetic finger and toe rings"" and ""get treated by a bioenergetic synchronization technique practitioner""!! Give me a break. He also recommends ""dianetics and scientology"". So beware. [...] Please save your money and don't go through the trouble that I've been through. [...]"
2,Good Book but no help!,"I enjoyed reading this book and I agree with pretty much everything that was said in it. But if you are looking to read any of the natural cures in this book, you will be very disappointed! According to the author he can't tell you any cures or he will be arrested, so you need to go to his website and pay a fee to subscribe to his newsletter to hear about the cures. What a scam! If you really want to read this book, do yourself a favor and borrow it from a friend and save your hard earned money!!"
5,Diet Pepsi Junkie,"I started drinking diet pepsi when I was a teenager because all my friends were and because we all wanted to be thin. Now, as a woman in her middle 30's I kept hearing how bad artificial sweeteners were and I still kept drinking them. It's funny how we do that. Any way, I just got done reading this book and I had a realization. I'm actually addicted to diet pepsi and that is why I have continued to drink it even though there are reports everywhere about how bad it is for you. I have not had a diet pepsi in a week. I am still drinking regular pepsi to get me through this rough time (and it is rough for me) but I will stop that as soon as I feel like I'm not craving diet pepsi. This book has really opened my eyes. There are so many changes I am going to make. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to recover their health."
5,Another positive review!,"I checked here and read so many great reviews about the book.I was happy to buy the book and happy with what I found in it. I could really tell this is a man with a mission and from the interview I saw on CNN I was impressed with his enthusiasm and he wasn't willing to let the interviewer only slam the bad PR that is going around. He is right, don't make this about him, make this about the information in the book.I have heard from many people how they have changed their lives and feel so much better just by doing a few things from and that to me makes it all worth while."
2,The Gaul,"The gaul of some people truly amazes me. I bought the book off an infomercial for $29.95 plus shipping and then find out it's a bust? While normally I wouldn't leave a tiny star and then write a bad review, this one warrants it.Taking advantage of people by giving the guestion and then asking them to pay more for the answer by going to their site. The gual.Don't bother. You can find the information online for free."
1,Looks like a scam,"First, I have not read the book. I have not ordered the book and only because I came here to look at the ratings and reviews which have thanknfully warned me about it. 300+ negative ratings and reviews by consumers can't be wrong. It looks great on TV but that doesn't make it good. Just want to say thanks to all those who rated this book and to amazon for letting us rate them, good and bad."
1,Very superficial,"I bought this before I knew anything about this guy. He is not a doctor. He's a nobody. What he says is not necessarily supported by any scientific data or other quantifiable research. Most disappointing, he doesn't have enough to say to warrant a whole book. I was expecting something really helpful on natural cures. Instead, I got the same old paranoid spiel about the FDA and the medical establishment. This guy's a phony and the book is a waste of money."
1,"Huge leaps of faith, false claims","The thesis behind this book is that the drug companies are deliberately withholding cures to many diseases, because they can make more money by keeping us sick. But Trudeau totally overlooks so many details: First, there are MULTIPLE drug companies, competing against eachother for products that sell. A cure for arthritis, cancer, etc. would make Billions for the company that developed it. Secondly, many people HAVE been cured of diseases like cancer--because of the drug companies.The book may offer some general good advice on alternative medicine--but the conspiracy claims are just a total crock."
1,Worthless Tripe,"All these long protest reviews that give Kevin Tradeau glowing compliments and emotional-ladden indictments makes me think that far from the negative reviews being written by pharmaceutical ""agents,"" the postiive reviews are being written by either a paranoid Tradeau or his mom.Give it up Kevin. The people have spoken. That is why your book has received such a low starred rating. You can fool some of the people soem of the time, as the saying has it right; but you can't full all of them all of the time.These negative reviews are not written by ""agents"" for the industries that you try to project your motives on; rather they're from the very same people you are trying--but failing--to dupe and take advantage of.Get a real job now and stop trying to make money by selling your worthless lies and trying to deceive us.We're on to you Kevin--you looser!"
3,A collection of disorganized thoughts,"This book is disorganized and unstructured. I guess this is a result of self publishing, in that there is no one there to edit the finished product.The basic theme is to cleanse your entire body and to not take any prescription drugs. On the one hand I find Kevin's fight against the FDA admirable. It may open the eyes of people who had no idea that FDA all about the money. But on the other hand I can't help but wonder if his black-and-white thinking is clouded by his scientology beliefs. He does praise scientology in this book.Some of his ideas seem illogical and unsubstantiated. I am a huge fan of alternative medicine, and I am all for books that educate the general public about various options. But this book doesn't do a very good job. There are some good ideas here and there, but the entire book reads like a list of his thoughts and ideas... without structure."
1,Minus 5 stars!,"This is a total scam. I should have done my research before buying this so called natural cures! If you do a google search: kevin trudeau fraud, you will find out what a scam this book is. He has been convicted for credit card fraud amongst other things. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It claims to have cures to illnesses/diseases. Not true. Just hokey essays on his ideologies. You will have to join his web site to get any information on cures! And that will cost you! By the way, he has not even replied to my email regarding membership. That is a bad sign. I am glad that I did not join."
5,My Daughter is smiling again because of this book,"I feel this book has helped me in many ways but the most important one is how it has helped my young daughter. She has struggled with her weight and not been a very active child - loved to read and I had always thought that was the cause of her problem. I took his advise and decided to see and alternative doctor and maybe he could shed some insight.You see my daughter is entering the junior high stage of life and becoming more drawn inward because of how she looks. I sat down with this book and the doctor and he told me about this great screening tool called a electroderm, completely none evasive and painless. He tested my daughter and found some problems in her pancreas and a few other areas.Under his guidance we have use healthful things to fix what is going on. Now she is steadily losing weight and has really gotten her beautiful smile back, all because of this book."
1,SCAM,"You are a complete fool to blindly believe Kevin. Try Googling him and you will find numerous, credible sources providing details of his criminal past. He is a CONVICTED FELON. He impersonated a doctor years ago (among about 10 other crimes) and is now dealing with serious legal/criminal issues by the courts, numerous multimillion dollar lawsuits by average people being hurt and mislead by his various CRAP products. There are tons of legitimate sources of accurate health and nutritional guides, books, DVDs by doctors, dietitians, nutritionists and others in the health/sports/fitness world that can give you much better results!This clown is a SALESMAN...nothing more. He is NOT qualified to teach you anything about health. Geeez people...grow some brains! Just because some clown is on TV does not make him sincere or qualified!"
1,Aweful! Buy this book instead:,"I downloaded Kevin Trudeau's book cures they don't want you to know about, and he doesn't give any cures in it. Not even suggestions. He just directs you to a website that wants you to pay every month. Can you say SCAM?If you're interested in naturally curing yourself I've found a better book written by a MD: Natural Health, Natural Medicine by Andrew Weil, MD. I'm to chapter 4 now, but the first chapter gives more information THAN KEVIN TRUDEAU'S BOOK IN ALL.Don't waste your money on this hack. He complains the whole book about the government and wines the whole time."
1,Truly powerful endorsement,"A recent review noted the ""powerful"" endorsement of Dr. Herbert Ley.His ""endorsement"" appears on the back of Trudeau's book.It certainly was powerful because poor Dr. Ley died three years before this book was written.Could it be? Has Kevin found a natural cure for death?"
5,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE,"I have got to believe that many of the negative reviews of this book are from people who either didn't read the book or from people with an agenda.This book changed my life. I lost a little over 50 pounds and cured my severe acne because of this book. I would have NEVER considered putting down my prescription drugs for herbal remedies before reading this book, but Kevin totally changed the way I think about my health.Nobody is paying me to write this. If anyone has any questions about the book feel free to email me at [...]."
3,"Isn't this the Second Edition of ""Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About""","I have read many reviews here that state you have to sign up for a 10$/month subscription to read about the cures. I know this was the case for the first edition. But now Kevin Trudeau is running commercials saying 200 pages have been added to the book. These new pages describe the cures. Which is it? Who is telling the truth?I haven't read the book, so I just tried to give it a neutral rating."
1,What a BOGUS RIP-OFF,"I am not with the FDA or the FTC, and I'm convinced that any positive reviews of this book were written by Kevin's Mom, family and friends.This book will tell you there is a method for for ailments, but to get the method you'll need to buy another book, or subscribe to his web-site, or ask your local pharmacy.If that's the kind of info you seek, then this is your book."
2,He probably means well...,"This book came highly recommended, unfortunately, I would not recommend it. While he has some worthwhile information, it is mainly a replay of the accepted wisdom in the alternative health community. He is very vocal about everything, sort of a no gray area book. For instance he thinks everyone should have colonics, or colon hydrotherapy, (enemas) which are controversial and risky at best. He spends a huge amount of time ranting about how the FDA has mistreated him, without giving specific details so that we can make our own decision about his treatment. Then of course, he repeatedly plugs his website subscription with promises of secret information he cannot print in the book. I was bored by this point and didn't bother checking his website. He appears to have good intentions but..."
1,I feel like I've been DUPED by Kevin Trudeau!,"Okay, so I thought the infomercial was interesting. Thought I'd buy the book. BIG MISTAKE! There are NO CURES in this book. Kevin Trudeau is as unscrupulous as the ""big pharmaceutical"" companies he talks about. He wants you give even MORE of your money to him by subscribing to his website for the cures. My guess is they are not even on it either. If he was a ""true crusader"" for natural health and natural cures, he'd do everything possible to give the knowledge away. He's just out to make a buck. Speaking of which, I'd like about $30 of them back!Would I recommend this book? - not in this lifetime."
1,"Natural Cures - Blah, blah, blah","Your money is better spent elsewhere. Kevin has totally misrepresented what this book is about. He does not provide any cures, as he has claimed countless times on his infomercial, because this information is ""censored"" by the FTC and others. He refers you to his website to spend more money for the info he didn't provide in his book. There is some useful information in the book, but it isn't what you expect."
3,"I agree with him, but....","I know what Kevin says about the FDA and the FTC are true. It's all about the money. There are, indeed, natural cures for all diseases, even cancer. I know that for fact. I know the importance of keeping the body alkaline and all that. As a Japanese, I know people in the U.S. are severely misinformed and ignorant when it comes to health and diet and put too much blind trust in drugs and doctors. But I was kind of disappointed after I've read some of the reviews here. I was going to purchase the book, but I'm having second thoughts. Kevin shouldn't have misled people by the title of his book. He seems passionate about what he preaches, but I believe he could have done it differently."
1,This book is dangerous and crap!,I know of at lest one person who's parents took him off of his psych meds beacuse of this book's advice. It really messed the kid up bad. There is nothing quite like taking medical advice from a convicted fellon with NO medical training!
1,I'd pass if I were you.,"My step father loaned this book as I thought it looked interesting. Good information, most of which I read elsewhere, several years back. I'll save you some time. Eat only healthy natural foods and get an hour of exercise every day. There. In the end - all the authors roads lead to his website, (which I hate to promote) [...] This is his web site where he wants to charge you $10 a month for more information or a one time $1000 fee. Check out his money hungry website before you waste your money. Kind of funny how he bashes greedy politicians, federal organizations and lobbyists and in the end he's just a scam artist himself. And by the way, all the 5 star reviews of this book are either friends of the author, or those who profit from the sale of this book. Now shut your computer down, stand up, and go get some exercise."
1,Can I Have My Money Back?,"By far, the worst waste of money I have made. Most of these ""natural cures"" anyone with any common sense already knows. I regret contributing to this scam."
5,Insightful book,"This book is really insightful. There's so much in here that I can use in my life to make things better for my family. Some of his ""cures"" are very simple and easy to follow. They make a lot of sense. Some of the warnings he gives about processed foods and meats grown with hormone-laced feed are way overdue. Good job in packing this all into one book. There's much to read but it's definitely worth it."
1,Garbage in Garbage Out!,Anyone who buys this book is a fool. The only bigger fool is one who follows the 'advice' in it.It's a shame that Amazon has such low moral values to even sell such a dangerous book. Amazon you are as bad a Trudeau and are in it for the $$$$$.
1,BOGUS!!!!!!!!!,"Kevin Trudeau's a liar, and a con man. He likes to frequently invoke the Gestapo and Stalin as a comparison to government agencies. And his ""cures"" are only available if you subscribe, for a fee, to his website. He's also big on colonics. So his answer to someone who asks him for a ""cure"", basically is: Shove it! (Literally.)Google this punk if you want more info."
2,Cure for insomnia,"Like other disappointed readers, I bought this and discovered that the good advice largely came to bad results, or no results. That being said, the writing style is nice, and the production values good enough to make this avoid being a waste of money. Just because it didn't cure me of anything other than insomnia doesn't mean it won't work for you."
1,I FEEL SO CHEATED?????????????,"I feel so cheated and betrayed.I really beilevedthis would be the answer for my many ailments.Instead it sadly looks like a Ponzi type scheme toseperate as much money from us as possible whilenever intending to pay out the value of the NaturalCures.Is there no relief for the common man???I feelso preyed upon and lied to by Kevin Trudeau andhis financial backers.If I had only read Amazon'sgreat customer reviews I would have saved myselfthe embarrassment of paying for this.IS THERE NO JUSTICE,HE HAS MY MONEY,BUT I STILLHAVE MY AILMENTS!!!!!!"
1,the parts he left out,"Kevin Trudeau sells a book with information thats based on his opinion and to get the complete opinion you have to got to his web sight and pay for the complete story. Just buying the book will not give you the answers your looking for,,,,that will cost extra. You should go to his web sight and look before you buy this book."
1,NATURAL CURES,"Don't waste your money. Author concludes there is nothing we can eat or drink that will not make you ill unless it is organic (most expensive food). He recommends purging your body of these toxic wastes but if you want to know how you have to call or go to his web site and pay to become a member. He is as guilty as those he writes about when he makes the statement ""it's all about the money."""
1,Kevin Trudeau can CURE CANCER,Kevin Trudeau cured my cancer!!! It really works!!! He is a modern day miracle worker. I owe my life to Kevin Trudeau. He is a good man. An honest man. A man who thinks outside the box. And HE CURED MY CANCER. And he can do the same for you for only $19.99. Wouldn't you want to cure your cancer for less than $20. Skip the expensive doctors appointments and chemotherapy infusions. Use Kevin Trudeau's knowledge. Buy the book. He really CAN CURE CANCER.
1,DIDN'T HELP,"THANKS FOR THE BOOK, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE INFO ON VERICOUS VEINS. MY NEICE HAS THEM REALLY BAD AS SHE IS ONLY 20YRS OLD. EACH YEAR THEY GET WORSE. SHE HAD OPENED HEART SURGERY WHEN SHE WAS 7 DAYS OLD. SO THANKS ANYWAYS. I HOPE THE BOOK CAN HELP SOMEONE ELSE."
2,Natural Cures,"Although this book does have some natural cures, it is also filled with rants of a ""mad at the medical community"" person. I was looking for a specific ailment and when I turned to that page in the book he advised me to not start reading at this page, but be good and start at the beginning. Rather spooky. I do still think there is some value in getting a practical, natural remedy to many of the medical conditions we have today"
3,Cure the cures.,"To begin with I loved Kevin Trudeau's Mega Memory, Mega Math and Mega Speed Reading programs. I also met Kevin briefly in 1999. He seemed to be a great guy.The book, Natural Cures, does not offer much information. The reason being is that nobody is allowed to make a medical claim without a medical degree. The government also threw an undo fit toward the orange juice industry and Cheerios because they made a claim that their product could lower cholesterol and reduce heart disease. Out of the three, Kevin stood up and fought back, so I give him credit for that.I highly doubt that Kevin is lying, but if for some reason he is, I trust the government even less. I believe the government comes up with laws just to show that they are accomplishing something in office. At any rate they should let Kevin reveal his ""Natural Cures"" in any form that he wants. And the Americans should use their common sense on whether to follow or not."
1,Why can't I select 0 stars?,"This book is written poorly, repetitive, and contains absolutely no citation or references to substantiate ANY of its claims. It is completely worthless in all respects. The author claims over and over that the FDA is evil and even ""incestuous"" because of their desire to make humans sick and amass more money. Well, this book makes me sick, and the author will only actually give you ""natural cures"" if you sign up for a monthly account on his website."
1,book is a ripoff,"Save your money. I spent $30 to keep reading throughout this book that Trudeau cannot tell you the information that is supposed to be in the book because ""the government will get me"". But, he refers you to his website where he says he will tell you the information that you bought the book for, if you pay more money. I guess the government won't bother him if he prints it on the internet. A total con-artist. Don't fall for this scam, keep your money and buy some good quality vitamins instead folks."
1,Kevin Trudeau banned by the FTC from producing health product infomercials...,"Look, I didn't read the book. But, you are crazy if you give the author any of your money. Kevin Trudeau, the author, has been banned by the FTC from ""producing, or disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product, service, or program to the public."" Check out this link on the FTC Government website, and then you decide!http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htm""This ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled American consumers for years,"" said Lydia Parnes, Acting Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""Other habitual false advertisers should take a lesson; mend your ways or face serious consequences.""If after checking out the link, you still want to buy the book, read a couple of the other reviews on the site and go for it!"
1,Very Undetailed,"Poor info and insight into the cures of disease. I felt a bit scatter brained at times feeling very overwhelmed by all the disconnected, incomplete details. At some points it would seem like each paragraph would bounce from one thing to the next, making it hard to focus and tie it all together. Even Trudeau's transitions were weak, and the book was terrible and I highly don't recommend it."
1,Should have waited.,Haven't completely read book but so far am very disappointed. Way too wordy. Have also learned more about Kevin Trudeau and have learned he is not what he claims to present himself to be. Would like to send the book back personally.
1,Scam,"You learn as much from this book as you learn by watching the author on television. You must pay monthly or for life to receive a newsletter that might give you some information. Similar information can be found for free at your local health food store! He talks a lot about the big corporations such as the pharmaceutical companies, and how they fleece the public. He has built a $2 billion empire, and I wonder how. A. S. Lang"
5,David and Goliath,"I have read this book and whole heartedly agree with Kevin Trudeau's point of view on the whole regulatory process and as well as the whipping that he is taking with the media. I can tell you from experience that there are many products that have not made it to consumers because the large corporations basically have bought out the technology to keep it from market or to protect their market share. It happens everyday. He is also correct in his evaluation of the how the media is just a puppet to the advertising dollars spent with these giants who with their money shape every one of our buying habits.The unfortunate thing is that this will never change until the public demands it, through their spending and their pressure on the so-called politians that are supposed to represent our best interests.A must read."
1,Flim-Flam Man,"This book is a complete fraud. It's common sense-- if the cures found within worked, you wouldn't have to buy a book to know about them. Everyone would know about them already, just like everyone knows that aspirin and tylenol fixes headaches.If you bought this book already, don't count on any of the ""miracle cures"" found within. Most aren't even given, instead they're hidden on a website that makes you shell out even more money. Think about it, does that sound like the dealings of an honest man to you?"
1,Disappointing,"If the title was changed around to read ""Why They Don't Want you to Know About Natural Cures"" then the book would have done its job because it contains good information about the FDA conspiracies. But since it's called ""Natural Cures"" I think that most people who read the book are looking for natural cures and it doesn't really give any good ones. The author gives excuses why he can't give the cures for the major diseases, and he gives a few already well-known home-remedies for some of the simpler ailments."
1,Natural Cures I will tell you if you pay more money$$$$$,"Trudeau is no stranger to the courtroom. He's a convicted felon. In 1991 he pled guilty to credit card fraud - and has a long past of legal run-ins with federal regulators. In fact, he's barred from selling products on television now, as part of a 2004 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations involving misleading statements surrounding health care products. Trudeau admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to stop selling health care products."
1,Please don't waste your money!,"Use some judgment and consider the source of this book. Kevin Trudeau is a total quack. He's selling snake oil and the truely sad thing is that so many people are buying it. He is selling a book now instead of various supplements and other products because the FTC has forbid him to sell the other junk. He has also been fined over $2 million by the FTC for false advertising. Do not give this man ANY of your money! His book is full of bogus quackery, as are his infomercials. Do some research and find out for yourself. I suggest taking a look at the Quackwatch website and search for his name."
4,Great Book,I loved this book. Very informative and motivational. Would recomend for anyone with chronic health problems that the medical community has not helped.
5,Great,"A Classic! Holds up well after all these years. Really good stories about social rituals and standards. Humorous, as well."
3,DVD Contents,"This DVD contains the following:""Meet The O'Briens"" (Failed TV Pilot)""The Joe E. Brown Show""""Let's Join Joanie"" (Failed TV Pilot)""Operation ESP""The 4 programs are fun to watch, But they are hardly the best place to start for somebody just learning about 50's TV. The picture quality ranges from average to poor, But that is to be expected with such rare contents. ""Let's Join Joanie"" is notable for starring Joan Davis before she did ""I Married Joan"", But the pilot is forgettable and wastes her talent. Overall it isn't a bad DVD, But don't judge 50's TV by it.Recommmend to those who like rare TV, or want to see some lesser-known 50's comedy."
1,or 'How To Clean Out Your Desk and Make Money',"My eye was caught by the pretty photo of the author on the cover. Now that I've read this stinker, I bet he lovingly searched for the best(old) photo of himself. I've never heard of him before but he joins the ranks of those who work hardest trying to avoid work. He's the Maynard G. Krebs (Work!) of Columbia, Class of 69'. Couldn't Paul Auster have had some nobility about taking good care of his wife and son? Oh, yeah, that would mean someone else coming first in his life. After I closed the cover I wondered what messed up this guy to never attach to anything. I looked him up on the internet and it's the old story-getting old, settling down, and finally growing up. And cleaning out his desk and diary and making a buck off it."
5,A Good Collection,"Paul gives us his first book under his new contract. The result: A short memior, some plays, a detective novel, and something about ""Action Baseball (I can't figure it out). Everthing except the memior (Hand To Mouth) are from his early days. Nothing breathtaking, but it's Paul Auster, so that means it's good. Regarding his memior, I must say that Mr. Auster is a very lucky man. Look how long it took Kelman to win the Booker Prize. And, more importantly, what happened to him. Anyway, this is a good book for fans. New ones should read ""The NY Triology"" and maybe ""Moon Palace."""
3,"Interesting autobiography, flat prose","This is a book for hardcore Auster fans only, I think. It has interesting tidbits that illuminate his prose and the 'chronicle of early failure' is indeed harrowing and interesting. yet, unlike most of Auster's prose, this account never trandescends itself; that is, it doesn't achieve the luminescence of the prose that Auster is capable of. There was a LOT of filler near the end of the book too (did we really need to see the Action Baseball game?) A far better account of the starving artist routine is Samuel Delany's _The Motion of Light in Water_"
5,The Isleys ROCK!,"Never a weak track, this baby funks all the way. High energy funk throughout with the guitar effects the Isley Brothers were fameous for in the 1970's. You listen to this and say to yourself, why don't I listen to this more often? It doesn't have the Top 40 hit tracks of some of their other CD's but it has the most consistently powerful music all the way throught. You will groove on this.If your kids come up to you and ask, ""Dad, what is funk?"" reach for this CD first. No words can explain it, but this music will."
4,life with cats,"If you love cats, you will love this book. It's all about real people's relationships with their cats. The stories are funny and sad and sometimes amazing, but they are consistently touching. And contrary to the previously review, the stories are NOT all about cats dying!"
4,Good First Effort,"This group has a real talent. It is true that there are good tracks combined with filler tracks. Overall the album is worth listening too. Beware, however, that if you buy this CD from Amazon there are three songs that have explicit lyrics edited from them. I did not find an un-edited version on Amazon or Overstock. Just a heads-up."
5,frickin sweet band,"crossfade just flat out rocks. i'm always buying cds of bands i haven't really heard a lot about, and this cd i am proud that i bought every song on here is great. COLD is an awesome song, COLORS rules, DEAD SKIN is another great song, BROKEN LIKE AN ANGEL also rock. so if you haven't bought this cd yet then go out and buy right now."
5,WARNING: People of planet earth...,"CROSSFADE is now invading your record stores, radios, hearts and minds with their sonic weapons. Your defenses are useless against their infectious lyrics, nuclear guitar riffs and ground shaking drums.Buy this CD. Resistance is futile.CCC"
4,"Good quality, price sticker on the bill","The cap is good quality and has that slightly faded/used look to it. It does come with the price sticker underneath the bill and in a sealed plastic bag. So, if you are thinking about gifting this, better to have it come to you to remove the price and then send it on. Unless, of course, you don't care."
5,Softcore wheel are AWESOME,"These are my favorite skating wheels I've ever used. That being said, I love carving, cruising hills, etc. I'm not a big park guy... Also, the littlest (AND I MEAN LITTLEST) amount of water/moisture sends your board right out from under you. However, If you ever ride on rough or less-than-ideal pavement, you know the terrible vibration you feel in your ankles and knees.. Not so with softcore wheels! These wheels are also nearly silent. I could not believe the difference.Seriously though, if you use your board for traveling and cruising, they are absolutely incredible. With these wheels you lose a LOT less kinetic energy compared to hard wheels. With these and a pair of Autobahn bearings I have no problem keeping up with my buddy on his long board.... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!..also, at $32.99 on amazon, they're significantly cheaper than anywhere else I could find them."
2,"not bootable, flipable","If you want to have a bootable USB drive, don't buy it. I tried many times, it cannot be booted from. All file system formats have been tried, fat, fat32, ntfs. None worked. Also, it is by far the only one that can't be flipped by Lexar's bootit program.Update: it is bootable, if you use PE2USB. But it is not flippable. Also it can be formatted to FAT16 even though it is 4gb."
5,Top book !!,Top book highly recommended reading for anyone that is interested in high power rocketry. This book is very informative with well thought through and documented builds from various people through the various levels of the hobby. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
4,A Pleasant Listen,"I had been a fan of Shawn Colvin for a long time before I picked up Cover Girl. Even though these are not her own songs, I wasn't disappointed. She has proven herself to be not only a masterful songwriter, but also an accomplished singer of others' work. The best tracks are ""Every Little Thing (He) Does is Magic"" - an anthem for every girl who has ever loved unrequietedly; ""Killing the Blues"" - a great live performance of a truly beautiful song; ""Window to the World"" and ""Home"" - two wonderful expressions of emotion; and ""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"" - although I still prefer the original Bob Dylan version (but then nobody can surpass the Master). A worthy addition to your collection."
5,awesome,"This was my introduction to Shawn Colvin and it makes me jealous of all the people who had the chance to see her live when half of these tracks were recorded. The voice, the guitar and familiar lyrics make this a great album to put on while driving or doing work around the house. I have have all of Shawn's albums and this one keeps drawing me back. ""Killing the Blues,"" ""Twilight,"" and ""This must be the place"" are my personal favorites but there certainly isn't a song I skip on this album. And the best part about Shawn is that not only can she sing someone else's lyrics, but she does a fantastic job of writing her own. Check out the others by Colvin."
3,Some good info,"There was some good info in this book, but mostly common sense. I am a early childhood teacher with a child with autism, and most of this is common practice in early childhood. It does give you a reason for the skill difficulty in children with autism, then gives you some ideas. not bad."
4,Great Show!,"This is an absolutely wonderful show for kids!! I highly recommend it.It contains 14 episodes:Disc 1The Witch SwitchNothin' Says Lovin' Like Somethin' From A CovenWag The WitchThe Most Dangerous WitchStage FrightWitchy GirlsDocumagicaryDisc 2This Is Your Nine LivesStone BrokeWhen In RomeMolar MolarXabrina, Warrior WitchLa Femme SabrinaWiccan Of The Sea"
2,Unfinished,"I couldn't believe this was how the series ended. I was a big fan of all the Magickers books, but this just doesn't finish the story. You want more and you never get it. I hate reading books that don't really wrap up the story for you. Drake creates an interesting universe, but doesn't allow you to close that last book feeling satisfied. Instead you feel as if there are at least a couple more books in here but it doesn't appear that there will ever be more."
1,RIP OFF,Please don't wasted $41 on this piece of crap. It's regular cheap $2 speaker wire that they put their plastic ends on and sell for $40. RIP OFF!!!! What these big companies do is put a little plastic thing on the end of their wire that fits into the system so if the wire breaks you can't just replace it with regular speaker wire you have to go out and get the specific wiring because without the little plastic ends they don't fit into your system.
5,Very entertaining arts & crafts item,"I have bought many of the Klutz and Chicken Socks books as gifts over the years, and have found most of them to be great buys. These doodle series sets are excellent! It makes an artist out of any child who shows an interest in drawing. They show step by step examples for the artist to copy and make very cute, dogs, cats, faces (depending on which of the doodle books you've chosen). Each book includes a roll of paper, pencil and sample doodes all packaged to travel well. Great for a trip in the car or to carry on an errand as entertainment while a child has to wait patiently. Great buy for the price!!!!"
1,Not for the everyday person looking for answers.,"I was curious to read and review this book--as the title sounded very interersting. After giving it about an hour, I realized that I was reading paragraphs over and over to get the meaning. It reads more like a textbook rather than a helpful, informational tool for someone looking for answers. I'm not sure who this book is directed toward.I also wonder why the name of the doctor who wrote the ""forward"" is about 5 times larger than that of the author????There are much more ""user friendly"" resources out there if you poke around:Why Don't They Just Quit? What families and friends need to know about addiction and recovery.Why Don't They Just QUIT? DVD Roundtable Discussion: What families and friends need to know about addiction and recovery."
5,Living Our Language: Ojibwe Tals & Oral Histories (Na,The number one book I recommend for keeping the language and culture. Anton Truer's interviews will live for generations yet unborn!
5,Fido Float,"Great product fits much better that the ones in stores because of mesh on the under part, and two handles on top."
3,Fido Float,"This was a good deal for what we needed, but I wouldn't get if you are going to use it a lot. Quality not the best but it worked for me because my daughter's dog only comes on the boat maybe twice a year and the Vest made it a snap to pull him onto the boat. Would recommend if you need it in a pinch."
2,Not so simple to crochet,"Most of the projects are quite involved lace style patterns. I am an experienced crocheter and would not attempt these projects, because I do not like to spend a year crocheting a poncho. Other projects have so many colorchanges that you will spend all day weaving in the ends. Before you buy it, preview it. The price on the used book is so low that you really are not taking a big chance and you might get some ideas. The Items are pretty.I'll propably pass my copy on to someone who likes doily style, repeating patterns that take a long time to make.My name for this book: NOT SO SIMPLE CROCHET."
2,Simple is right!,"The title is fitting. Most of the designs are pretty simple. Some seem more intricate because of the yarn choices, but that is one of my biggest problems with this book. A lot of the patterns would have been more appealing to me if they had been made with different yarns. The thick, bulky yarns in the cardigans and sweaters can only make most people look bulky and who needs to add on the pounds these days? The majority of the designs are simple 1980s through 1990s styles. Nothing unusual. Not very many would be worth making. I would have to make too many adjustments and hope that the styles still worked with other yarns. Even at this price it wasn't worth it for me. If you are skinny and like simple heavy designs then this book may be for you, otherwise, skip it."
3,Just Another Collection,"I had high expectations for this compilation, because it was put together by Nick Saloman of Bevis Frond. I thought it might have some sort of thematic unity or present some really special lost treasures. It is just your average, run of the mill group of obscure 45s, unfortunately, from my perspective. The songs vary stylistically, from ballads to upbeat pop, the sound is inpaired by poor sources in some cases and perhaps excessive use of noise reduction technology as well. Not bad if you are really into pop-psych archeology, then you might enjoy this. I like several songs quite a bit, but others just feel included for no good reason other than to fill up the disc. The casual fan should first check out Nuggets 2, which has a stellar cast of UK pop, psych and freakbeat songs from the master tapes, before venturing down this road."
1,Puts me to sleep,"I'm really interested in astronomy, so I picked this up one day. I wish I had gotten something else instead though, because this is terrible. I can't even watch a single DVD (there are 5) in one sitting because it is literally so boring that it puts me to sleep. The narrator's voice is extremely dull, the guy(s) they interview are dull, the graphics and pictures are ""meh"" at best, and the music is fairly soothing; which is a great combination to have you snoring within 20 minutes of putting this in.So, if you are having trouble sleeping at night, I would highly recommend getting this. However, since I bought this to try to learn more about astronomy, and not be bored out of my mind, I can't recommend it for that."
1,basic apple and potato peeler,I'm 80 and not to sharp..couldn't figure out how to use it..my kids are all grown and away...so I'm stuck with this ..would like to return it and get the real simple one ..if that's possible..please let me know..thank you
1,"only works well on the ""perfect"" produce","Do not use on potatoes! Unless they are perfectly proportioned, you will end up with a very tiny result once the peel is removed. I read the other reviews on adjusting the device, but every time we ended up very poor results."
4,It is worth it,I recommend this product; we use it almost every day with the kids. The only negative things are I think it peals a little too deep; but the kids rarely finish the apples anyway.
3,Maybe an Apple Peeled,It worked for about 5 minutes out the box. The handle stopped turning the shaft that the apple is turned by. I had 4 pies to make on Thanksgiving and could only do 2. This was a major fail for Back To Basics!
1,No suction!,The apple peeler was not the best. The suction cup on the bottom will not hold the peeler to anything!
1,USELESS,"This product is useless and I will be sending it back for a refund ASAP. When trying to peel apples, the peeler blade just digs in causing the apple to twist off of the forks. With potatoes it requires 2-3 passes to get them completely peeled which in turn causes a lot of waste. I have tried all of the adjustments available with little or no improvement."
4,"Not quite as ""perfect"" as I wanted it to be","Like the product a lot, but a couple of things would make it a little better. Wish the peeler unit was more adjustable {get it closer of farther away from the bar that holds the item beeing peeled}Another thing, wish I could take the peeler unit from the base for a little easier cleaning"
1,No good,"Was really excited about getting this product to help with canning. I used it the day it arrived and after thirty minutes went back to peeling apples by hand. I does nothing but make a mess, not worth the money."
4,Easiest apple peeler,Makes quick work of denser apples like granny smith. If the apples are overripe or soft you will have problems with this. The tension causes the peeler to dig into soft spots and they wont peel right. Makes uniform slices for pie.
2,apple peeler,"i'm sorrythe apple peeler and apple corder does not hold tight on top of the tile,thanks you very much"
4,Apple peeler,This is A gift for my Brother I hope he like it.He loves to bake apple pies and this will help him A lot.
4,apple peeler,"I use this whenever I make apple pies or want to dry some apples in my dehydrator. It works really well, although you have to play around with it at first to get it to peel the right amount off the apples."
4,apple peeler,"I thought the apple peeler was great, I have an older model that hooks to the table. I purchased this for my daughter, had problems with the suction finally put on a cookie sheet."
4,Very pleased,"I'm very pleased by this peeler. I've used it multiple times for just peeling and the peeling, coring & slicing. It works perfectly. The bolts were a tad tight when first receiving it, but thats not something to complain about, just be careful. I would like to be able to core the apple without slicing it, but I still am very happy with this peeler."
3,Suction doesn't work well,"We bought this model after experiencing issues with our clamp style peeler hoping that this one would have stayed attached to the table better.Well, it didn't. We have read, re-read, and followed all directions, but it still does not stay suctioned to the table for more than 1 apple.Overall the design is what you'd expect from any apple peeler/slicer/corer- pretty standard, but the execution just didn't follow through.My in-laws have a Williams Sonoma brand that works super- never lost its grip after 10 apples at least.We'll see how this one works attached to our new granite countertops instead of the wooden kitchen table."
5,finale of the series- excellent!!!,Once I picked up the first book of this series I could not dare pick up another book. I like all types of books and Beverly Lewis has done an outstanding job with these and you definetely feel like you are living with the amish culture very interesing worth purchasing!!!
3,"Answered questions, but much too cryptic for me","I wanted more details about Leah's father, about Lizzie, about the fellows who came over from Ohio and how the politics worked...I did NOT like the total power poor Jonas had to yield to but hats off to him for waiting for his first and only love. I wanted more on Jake of course, perhaps in later books?"
5,Very nice emergency light and radio. LED lights very bright.,"Very clever design for an emergency light. The LED lights are very bright and have options for low, med, bright. The radio is very clear and actually better than the AM/FM radio we were using."
3,a weaker entry in the series,"This is another volume in the Handing on the Faith series. This is a weaker volume in that it makes many assumptions about family relationships that may not translate into specific family situations: it makes little allowance for families in which the grandparents converted to Catholicism, for single parent families, for mixed marriages. It makes more allowance for the parents' (rather than grandparents') generation primarily in terms of non-practicing Catholics.However, for traditional families dealing with handing on the faith in support of (or in spite of) parental religious education especially where physical distance presents a barrier, this volume is useful."
3,GAMEBOY ADVANCED SP BAG,"EVENTHOUGH THIS BAG MAY NOT HOLD ALOT OF ITEMS, IT IS STILL A GOOD PRODUCT WHEN SOMEONE DOES NOT WANT TO CARRY EVERYTHING OR WHEN TRAVELING FOR SHORT DISTANCES OR WHEN SOMEONE DOES NOT PLAY THE GAMEBOY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. IT KEEPS OUT FOREIGN MATERIAL, IT DOES REGULATE TEMPERATURE SOMEWHAT AND IS EASY TO OPEN (AS IN MY CASE I USE ONE HAND). ALL OTHER BAGS ARE FINE EXCEPT THEY HOLD EVERYTHING TOO TIGHT AND I CAN'T GET MY FINGERS OVER THE ITEM I WANT TO GET OUT. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEGATIVE ABOUT ITEMS SUCH AS THIS, IT'S OK TO VOICE YOUR OPINIONS THAT IT DOES NOT WORK FOR YOU. HOWEVER, BECAREFUL BECAUSE THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS AND ITEMS LIKE THESE MAY MAKE THEIR LIVES MUCH EASIER."
5,Inspirational,"This title is absolutely worth every penny. Though weighing in at only 143 pages, it is deceptively meaty and educational. The 106 selected photos (47 color and 49 B/W) are crisp, beautiful, and plentiful, and the inclusion of a maps and a glossary were also helpful. The mosaics selected for illustration are sublime, and even those ravaged by time are hardly less beautiful for it. Chapters are (in order) Intro, Greek Period, Roman Italy, Roman North-West, Roman Africa, Wall and Vault Mounts, and Context and Meaning. In a book of this length each chapter is necessarily short, but the examples chosen to illustrate each section are well-chosen to guide further study in selected areas."
5,Not just for Pilates,"As I am rather tall (5/8""), I like this band as it is somewhat longer than the regular resistance bands. It also has padded handles, which makes for a no slip grip. I use it in my Body Vive class, rather than the bands issued by my athletic club, and everyone wants to know where I got it. The first one lasted for almost 2 years of regular use, and I am now on my second. Next time, I will replace it sooner, as I discovered they stretch out over time."
4,The Zombie Zone,"I liked when they said they were going to see an alligator nest and it was pretty funny that they never got to see an alligator nest until the end. And also, when they found the robber looking for his wallet, I really liked that. It was also pretty cool that a good guy who's not part of Dink, Josh, and Ruth Rose, found a clue. And the wallet that the good guy found was the bad guy's wallet. And it was good that he got caught. And I also liked when Dink spotted that guy on the table when they were going for lunch near by them and Josh saw him. And also, I thought he was a bad guy but it was pretty weird that he wasn't the bad guy. A different guy who was walking to that place, he was the bad guy."
1,Not worth the money,"The production values of these two tapes are more ""home video"" than instructional. They are more to demonstrate Tom Proctor's Tao Chi Do techniques than to teach any kind of useful or practicle defensive or offensive techniques.The techniques demonstrated are minimal with no follow-up. Attempting to use them ""on the street"" is likely to cause you a lot of grief. His advice to RUN is the best defensive tactic on the tapes.The tapes are interesting to watch, given the above caveat, but are definately not worth the price."
5,Spectacular Book for F. Scott Fitzgerald Enthusiasts!!,"If you are a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, this book is an absolute must-have! While I own just about everything that is written by or about Fitzgerald, this is perhaps my favorite book to peruse. It is compiled just like a personal scrapbook and is replete with photos of the Fitzgeralds as well as articles (by and about Fitzgerald)written in the 20s and 30s. Much of this content you will not find elsewhere, at least not in such abundance. Bruccoli, America's leading Fitzgerald scholar (as well as Fitz's own daughter, Scotty) did a spectacular job of putting this together. The scrapbook format gives the book an intimate nature and the set up is extremely attractive. Best of all, at just around $20, it is an absolute steal for the price! If you love Fitzgerald, don't go without this collection! It would make a splendid addition to any high school classroom that teaches Fitzgerald or any personal library that celebrates true literary classics."
4,Good for its purpose,"If you're looking for a comprehensive guide to elk hunting, this isn't it! On the other hand, if you just want to spend some time looking through the thoughts and ideas of other elk hunters, buy this book.Yes, some of the suggestions are contradictory. That's because this is a compilation of ideas from many different people. Ask three different hunters the best way to take an elk and you'll probably get five different answers! And all five of them are in this book.For me, this is the perfect ""bathroom book."" You know, the one you can pick up and glance through when you've got nothing else to do. You don't have to start at the beginning and read through to the end. Open it to any page and see what another hunter has to say.Especially considering the very reasonable price, I definitely recommend this book."
2,"It looks 'WOW' here, but u get just the opposite expression when u receive the delivery.","I purchased this item as soon as i looked it here... and i was expecting a amazing ear-ring. But when i received the package, it was not so amazing.If you look here, it seems that the 'Topaz' is surrounded by white crystals, but actually if you look carefully those are not the crystals but just pieces of shining silver.Moreover, the ear-rings are made in China, so you can expect the quality."
3,Many sparks but few streaks,3 1/2Friendly mixture of ethereal and accessible lends the spaced post-rock import a sleek finish which altogether impresses if not consistently stuns.
3,Good Stuff,"This is a really good instrumental record, a bit melodic, a bit rock and very ambient. It dabbles just a bit on the more poppy side of things, where I was hoping for more of an indie sound like Caspian and Explosions in the Sky. Still, it's a solid disc."
5,Excellent general project management book,"This is one of the best project management books for introducing employees to modern project management in an interesting way. Most project management books are ver dry and lack realistic examples. Thus, it is difficult to motivate people to read and use such materials. This is a very practical, down to earth book that has many guidelines that you can use immediately as you read the book. Some of the strengths of the book are: 1) best description of matrix management; 2) use of collaborative tools in managing projects; 3) how to deal with multiple projects; 4) how to share resources across several projects; 5) how to deal with risk in projects. The authors have developed a very creative and useful approach in dealing with project risk that associates project risk with unresolved issues. I highly recommend this book."
2,Too depressing for words,"I know many people rate this movie very highly, but all I can say is . . . WHY? Yes, it is well made and, yes, the acting is good, but it was horrible to see the suffering and degradation the characters went through. After I saw it, I felt upset and revolted, and the feeling persisted even into the following day, which gives you an indication of just how depressing this movie is. I would never, ever watch this movie again, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone. In fact, I feel like I need to go take a shower now to wash off all the ""yuck"" just thinking about it."
3,Seriously angry movie,"In my view it has zero entertaining value, it simply makes a very strong and very negative statement about Indian society."
2,Another Hollywood Oscar Stroke Fest,"Over hyped to the Max! If you buy this movie because of all its Oscar wins you will be really disappointed. This Movie was not very interesting and culturally it is so different in it's approach that most Americans will have a hard time watching it, unless of course you like Movies that break out into Song and Dance and Characters who almost never speak.What this movie's Oscar wins are all about is a an attempt by Hollywood to put out their right hand in a Gesture of acceptance to Bollywood so that they can finally get their left hands into there wallets!It's horrible that movies Like Batman, Frost Nixon and Benjamin Button get very little acknowledgement and movies like this Win everything. No wonder so many of us have stopped watching the Oscars.Save your money and buy a copy of Frost Nixon or Batman and let them know what you really think of the Oscars."
1,No service from Fox,"Upon receipt of the DVD Slumdog Millionare, Amazon contacted me to tell me the DVD sent may not have contained what the jacket said. Mine was missing the features promised. I called Fox and reported it, but I didn't hear back from Fox. After three weeks, I called again. Surprise, surprise - Fox had no record of my call. Fox asked me to furnish the information again, which I did. Later that day Fox called me again; onceagain, Fox had not correctly taken my information. This time, Fox wantedme to send them my copy of Slumdog, and they said that upon receipt of mycopy they would send me the correct Slumdog. Since Fox could not seem to get my information correct after three tries, I decided to keep the DVD I had, based on the theory that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.Fox should be ashamed of themselves for not providing better customerservice. Fox has lost me as a customer, and I have been busy telling people about the extremely poor service from Fox."
3,Too much hype!,"I feel like I'm one of the few people who read the book before seeing the movie. I really liked the book - very intricate subplots that tied together at the end. This movie is very very loosely based on the book. The movie pretty much just took the premise and created a new story with it.The movie was so different from the book that I was not disappointed. The movie was fast-paced and very entertaining. I really loved the music too (will probably check out the soundtrack now). But I just did not think it lived up to the hype, especially the Best Picture Award.Good movie, but also read the book - it's better!"
3,Worth a watch,"A very good movie for the topic covered and great acting - however, not quite as good as the hype or all the awards."
2,Overrated & overblown with an American type ending,"I reluctantly rented this movie last night. Being a fan of foreign films I was a little hesitant to rent it as I had suspicions about the movie. Sure enough. The movie was ok at best. But definately not good & much less great. OVerall it was pretty boring. But what really just threw it away for me was the the ""American"" style happy ending. The guy gets, the girl & the millions, & the bad guy brother kills the bad guy & of course martyrs himself to redeem himself. If you are serious about foreign movies pass on this load of bunk & rent a real one. This is a joke."
3,Worth Viewing..3 1/2 stars.,"I would not have chosen this movie to view. Having said that, I'm glad a close friend did choose it for us to view together as I was very pleasantly surprised. I liked the story, the way flashbacks explained the events taking place, the way in which it was filmed, and the believability of the characters. I found it entertaining, and although another viewer mentioned scenes of torture I don't feel anything was blatantly overdone. This is a work of fiction, and I like happy endings too."
2,A Loud Sound Signifying Nothing Much,"This is one of those books that presents evidence which helps confirm the stereotype of the ""egghead"" intellectual and the circuitous reasoning they apply, and how it all signifies nothing much in the final analysis. Though Mr. Braude undoubtedly possesses a formidable intelligence, and though he is to be respected for his command of language and his objectivity (though is objectivity so necessary a criteria when researching paranormal phenomena?), I finished this book with a feeling of ""And your point is?""; having learned nothing, nor had anything confirmed or denied. Since Mr. Braude applies the usual triple-speak and uses 50 words when 20 will do, this book takes 306 pages to conclude...well, nothing much. The ""Ivory Tower"" strikes again! Pass this one by."
2,Fit great on my Remington 870,"Fit great on the remington 870 with the larger diameter magazines. Installs well, but the sling mount is way over subdued and that affects the sling mount. I was missled by the picture though, as it leads you to believe that the Uncle Mikes sling mount comes with it. It does not!"
5,Indispensable,"You need this atlas if you are going to drive yourself around Ireland. The maps are easy to read and finely detailed. Many of the names are given in both English and Irish (Gaelic); this is essential because many road signs are now in Gaelic. With the Atlas in hand you will be able to figure out where you are, and you will also develop a feel for Gaelic spelling and pronunciation."
1,Not one good thing about it,"Absolutely terrible. One of the worst romance books I've ever read. The characters were unbelievable, the plot was contrived, dull dialogue, and a ""big lie"" that was ridiculously inexcusable. Don't waste your time!"
1,....-tacular!,"This is my least favorite Atmosphere CD. I bought this at the God Loves Ugly tour the first night it was available and have hated it since. Slug has lost the clever rhymes and tight beats (ANT really dropped the ball on this release) that made Atmosphere's previous releases hot and instead whines about girls over mediocre beats. Buy Lucy Ford or Overcast; don't waste your money on this CD. Good tracks: Saves the Day, Lovelife, Vampires, Modern Man's Hustle, Blamegame."
2,it made me depressed,sorry it just did...too dramatic not enough party tracks. i guess if you want that it's cool. but i like people under the stairs and ugly duckling better.
4,I do like it for my boy BUT...,The flavor is not great taste. My boy takes a long time to drink it. He wished there is a grape flavor and not too creamy liquid. I had been looking for a liquid vitamin for him but he just don't want to take it everyday because he thinks the taste of a chewable vitamin that he was taking before this did taste better. So he wanted to go back to the chewable. I also wish that it has calcium in it and iron. This is not really too satisfying for both of us. Sorry Natrol!
5,The Bomb.,Every one that has seen this asked me where to get one and to be honest I forgot I got it on Amazon. So now I can tell everyone where to get one.
4,Excellent but the adagio has anomalies,"Many might be interested in downloading the third movement as it is so famous. However, the Berlin ensemble plays a slightly different interpretation of a passage than what I am used to. In bars 19 and 20 (oboe and clarinet parts respectively), the third demisemiquaver (thirty second note) of each bar is raised a semi-tone. I thought it sounded odd and looking at the score on IMSLP, this should not be the case. Perhaps this reading is from a different edition or maybe it is a personal embellishment, but I prefer the piece without the raised semi-tone. Musically I would have given this five stars except for this."
1,Do you want to buy this?,"That depends on what your looking for. This is 10rs long, in 1hr parts.What the Collection does is , make fun of UFO believers, plain and simple.1st they place a UFO believer on, and he talks about his story with goofy music in the background, then they place a debunker on with serious music in the background and then they even have the narrator explains how foolish UFO believers are. To me, its not taken seriously enough. If you want to make a documentary about hating , debunking, or making fun of UFO believers then at least make that known with the title. Something like , UFO Nuts! or UFOs are fake! Or even Debunking UFOs! Lets us all know your against them before we buy it. I gave it 1 star because of the fact it wasnt taken seriously at all. I would have been ok with there view point if they did it in a serious manner and had respect for everyone in the documentary."
1,I wish I had bought something else,"I bought this seat because I saw it had great safety reviews, but there are other seats out there that are just as safe if not safer that are much better than this one.It's way too heavy. The handle is not ergonomic and it is difficult to carry. The handle is also very tough to move up and down (the release levers stick) and it is very noisy. The canopy is also very noisy when adjusting it and it's too high---I have to put the canopy down when I take the seat in/out of the car or else it squishes up into the ceiling. No cushioning...my son has never been snug or comfortable in this hard, hard seat. It does not secure into high chairs or shopping carts.If you're still in love with this seat, then be sure to test all of these features out in a store to make sure my issues won't be issues for you."
3,The handle is a problem,"The car seat is fine... The base is hard to install, or maybe it is just so in our car, it keeps tilting to one side after a while and we have to reinstall it. The handle is bad it is very hard to move and it wakes up the baby when I try to move it in the upright position, so I just carry her with both hands into the house or to the snap-n-go. With 4 months she has almost outgrown it and looking back I wish I bought a convertible Britax marathon from the start and carried her in her Baby Bjorn.It is not a bad infant car seat; it is just not as good as I thought seeing all the good reviews. But it was very helpful to have for the first 2-3 months until she could hold her had very well. Hope this helps...don't expect too much...it is just a plastic car seat."
2,Not as great as I expected,"From the reviews this seemed to be the best choice. My only complaint, and it is a big one, is that the straps don't snug up evenly. The left strap would be tight over my son's shoulder while the right would be loose. Even after I would push the button and pull some slack out on the left side when I went to tighten again only the left side would tighten. Any parent knows if you are trying to get out the door with an infant, having to fuss with the straps so that the child is safe in the car is a huge hassle. Several times I have had to actually take him out to mess with the straps or because he was crying due to my messing with the straps."
2,Very dissapointed...,"When I was preparing for the birth of my son, I took a lot of time reviewing products for my baby..When I got to this one I follow the reviews and suprise we got it at my baby shower..but it did not fill our expectations...very hard to install the base and if you have a big baby specially in the first months they seem very uncomfortable, it is extremely heavy to carry out..and does not have head support which is a must during then first three months of your babies live...I don't recomended"
4,Very effective sleep aid,"I tried this even though skeptical, and I am happy to say that it works. For the past couple of nights I have had the most consecutive hours of sleep that I've had in months. Evidently, it is true that as you age, your body can lose its natural melatonin. I am 65 years old, and I've been trying to figure out what's wrong. I actually thought I might need a thyroidal adjustment.The only down-side to this product is that I found myself yawning all afternoon yesterday. Tonight I'll try cutting one of these 5 mg CR pills in half to see what happens. If I can consistently manage 7 hours of sleep on this amount, I'll be so happy! Perhaps the half-life is too long for me when taking the full dose. The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars rather than 5 is that I do not yet know if I can control the grogginess the next day by cutting them in half. Otherwise, I would give this product 5 stars."
5,never will leave home without it,"For the past 5 years I have always had trouble sleeping but this past year it has been just horrible. I was lucky to get 2 hrs of uninterrupted sleep. Well, I found out about this when someone mentioned it about helping my dogs. I tried it myself and purchased 5mg tablets and 1mg tablets. I increased my dose slowly and after 2-3 weeks, I found my dosage. I actually take 10mg every evening and now I usually get 6 hrs of sleep. I do not have any side effects. In fact, I always had restless leg syndrome and that improved drastically. I have less night sweats. I feel great. I have more energy than ever. I am not sleepy at all during the day. I look younger because I am actually getting sleep. Yay! for Melatonin. Both my Mom and husband have tried it and they have had horrible nightmares. It works great for me!"
5,this really works,I sometimes have trouble sleeping and do not want to become addicted to a prescription drug-this melatonin is perfect and it is actually good for you!
2,Didn't do anything for me.,"These only made me feel a bit weird, my head got a real uncomfortable feeling and I did not fall to sleep even when going directly to bed. I believe my sleeplessness is from menopause so maybe for another reason they may work well...still searching for my answer to a good night's sleep...I gave it 2 stars as it is probably not an issue with the product."
4,At first....,At first it was great but it really only took a week or so to start not working as well. I take it at around 7PM to go to bed at around 10PM.
4,Have been looking for time-released Melatonin,"I believe it helps. To the extent that Melatonin works, it should be time-released as I understand the half-life is only 45 minutes."
3,Kiran Ahluwalia,"Kiran Ahluwalia is a modern day composer of ghazals which are Punjabi folk songs. I had heard of her somewhere else as part of a group of artists and was quite impressed and hence, this was the reason for purchasing the CD. Although I am a big fan of Indian music and Kiran is quite an accomplished award-winning musician, I was disappointed in this CD. It is lively and upbeat and I had been expecting something slower, although there are some which slow down a bit. I would suggest not going into this CD with any expectations and perhaps that was my problem with it. I may also have been assuming that because they are folk songs they are slower just as most of our American folk songs are. I love just about all forms of music and perhaps after a few more listens I will fall in love with this one."
2,Only for 1.6 liter Miatas,"This book is for 1.6 liter Miatas, built from 1990-1993. It is much less useful for later Miatas. Unfortunately, this information is not provided to potential buyers of the book. The followup book, for the later 1.8 liter Miatas, was apparently discontinued soon after publication, for reasons unknown to me."
4,"Above average, lacks a full page wiring diagram.","The authors have given us a book that Maita lovers will be able to utilize on a daily basis. The only thing I found missing was a traditional full page wiring diagram, bumber to bumber."
3,It's On My List,"For those of you who may miss an inserted libretto I suggest making the investment of purchasing a book of The Complete Lyrics of GS like the one by Deems Taylor. Some of these volumes are still available on Amazon. It is a great help when the sound or a singer's diction is poor and you get the full libretto including dialogue and not just the songs. I keep the book next to my GS collection. Some of my irritations with this cd are: Michael Ducarel who falls rather flat as Koko. He pronounces his a's like an American and not very much the British way of which I am more used to hearing with GS. I miss the usual audible ""kisses"" between Nankipoo and Yumyum in the ""Plighted"" number. Katisha lacks a sense of humor in her voice. Yes this production is on my little list of cds I will be replacing with a better one."
2,"Works, but noisy and","I bought this product since it was EnergyStar rated, but it often cycles on and off within a couple of minutes. I can't quantify it, but that seems inefficient. Secondly, it is really noisy. I can hear it two floors up in my house due to its vibrations."
1,Bad charger,"Do not buy this product. It will charge the batteries. However, if your battery goes bad (which you will never know until you try to charge it) the battery will fry the charger with no warning what so ever. The charge light will just go out, and it will never work again. Instead, buy the upgraded charge made by Firestorm with indicator lights for your 24 volt batteries."
3,Adequate - Enjoyable,"Make no mistake, this is an excellent recording of this wonderful operetta. However, there is a tendency these days to rate recordings higher than they deserve - probably because they are new & fresh. And for some reason those who do so often ignore the quality of the voices in the recordings. The singing in this recording is very good and the characterizations are fine. But to suggest that it is comparable in quality to the superb 1964 D'Oyly Carte recording under Sir Malcolm Sargent is an error.The voices in the 1964 recording - Harwood, Hood, Knight, Potter, Reed, Sandford, Adams - are perhaps the best ever to sing this music and Sargent was one of the greatest of G&S; conductors. I would rate the current recording as perhaps the 3rd or 4th best of those available. In addition to the 1964 recording, consider the Marriner which is also excellently sung and also includes the dialogue."
3,Entertaining,Bailey White's collection is enjoyable. Her subject matter tends to be repetitive but her talent has crafted an interesting read.
4,Great Beginners Book,"This is a great book for beginners. Not as in depth as The Complete Homeopathy Handbook (by Miranda Castro), but a very good book for beginners. Very well organized and put together for simplification on finding the correct remedy for the proper ailment."
1,Worst backpack ever.,"This atrocity is transparently an attempt at turning a cheaper duffle-type bag into a more expensive backpack with the minimum material and design. It's basically a box on your back. A big box. I weigh 190 and this thing is still wider than I am. It's none too comfortable either, with the square edges jabbing you in the back. I ended up with this one instead of a Lowepro or one of the more expensive Tamracs because a) it's cheaper than the top-to-bottom-padded backpacks, and b) the Lowepro has a bulky, nonremoveable waist belt that makes air travel inconvenient."
3,"Lacklustre, indeed","I used to like these performances, but over time it has begun to appear to me that they aren't that good. Bronfman's technique so easily matches Prokofiev's challenges that he sounds almost bored with them. I don't see why Hurwitz thinks Bronfman's piano is in danger, if you consider that he rips through the music so effortlessly and, indeed, with little interest. By contrast, try Alexander Toradze's hyper-furious take on the G minor. He makes things too elephantine perhaps, but it's more interesting than what we get here."
1,ugh,"If you're a pro-choice woman, this probably isn't the book for you. I should have known that considering the author of the foreword. Overly political undertones. Assumption that every women who has had an abortion feels guilt over killing the fetus. Kind of a bizarre take on the strengths perspective, really. I'm a social work professional and was considering recommending this as a class text--no thank you! At least I bought it used and didn't contribute any money to these jerks."
5,Though-provoking,Very honest and thought-provoking look at women who sufffer from post-abortion syndrome. Theresa Burke writes about post-abortion symptoms from a very balanced perspective. She also shares stories of abortion through the eyes of clients she has seen. This book really makes you think. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in working with or knows someone who has had an abortion.
1,Horribly Written,"This was an easy read, but I couldn't connect w/ any of the characters. It was 100% predictable from the beginning. And a lot of the information didn't make sense ""She was always honest"" but then she lied a bunch. I just didn't get it at all!"
4,Very good debut album,"This is a very good debut album from the Dutch group Total Touch. Trijntje Oosterhuis, the lead singer of the group, has a powerful, amazing voice that is put to excellent use. Infectious dance cuts like Touch Me There, That's What I Want, and Doo Ba La Dee just make you want to get up and DANCE. For slower songs, there's One Moment Your Mind, and For This Moment Only. For This Moment Only is a gorgeous, beautiful sad song about a dying person (not in a morbid way) and Trijntje does such a great job on it that I almost cried while listening to it. The best track on the album is Somebody Else's Lover, which is neither slow nor dance, but has a cool groove somewhere in between. Why only 4 stars, then? Well, there's a couple tracks that aren't that great, like Standing Strong Together. For the most part, however, this is a really excellent pop album. It's 19 bucks, yes, but it is really worth it, and you won't regret buying it. I definitely recommend this album."
1,The bulbs faded to white after TWO days,"I had to order 2 packs since I needed 3 bulbs, one bulb was DOA right out of the box. If that wasn't bad enough... the remaining three changed from a faint blue(not what I was looking for) to a white hue w/in 2 days. Would have given a rating of 0 stars if I could have. For what it's worth... the now-white bulbs have been functioning normally for the past 8 months, and were decently priced."
3,True Courage,"This was a selection for our book club. Not a book I would have chosen on my own. It is a mystery, lots of characters, some good some evil. The good people were courageous and strong with strong faith. The bad guys were really bad. The good people you actually cared about, they seemed real in their relationships with one another. There is a love story as well as the mystery aspect."
4,Great Romance & Action Thriller,"True Courage is the fourth book in the Uncommon Heroes series and this one diverges from the Navy Seal theme. The main character is FBI agent Luke Falcon whose job supplies plenty of action, adventure and danger. Those very dangers make it difficult for Caroline Lane to love him because of her fears of losing him. Little does she realize danger is coming into her own life and after she passes through it, she may find the courage she lacks."
3,Wrong sword,I recived the sword about 1 hour ago. i got the bankai sword and not the shikai but i was going to get the bankai anyways so its okay. i really wanted this one. :(
4,Almost perfect (and other swords),That the wrapping is not long enough to cover acutal blade like anime/manga which if wanted should be an option and when blade covering is not used for that it should be able to double over the handle covering also are you working on the before shi-kai (the one he had at the start) and or Bankai one?
2,Starts off strong then leaks,I am on my second PUR faucet-mounted water filter and am disappointed. I mistakenly thought that the leaking that began after two months of owning the first filter was an anomoly but the replacement unit is spraying all over the kitchen. Will try the Brita now.
2,somewhat disappointing,"It is probably a matter of taste, but I preferred the recording of Boieldieu's Harp Concerto by Robles with The Academy. To me that recording provided more fluidity and warmth of tone. In this recording by Nordmann, I was more conscious of the technique of the harpist than the enjoyment of the music. So, dynamic range etc. but in my opinion some loss of fluidity; I wanted to focus on the melody.This CD provides concertos by Alvars and Viotti, which I had wanted to hear since I had not heard them before. Again, possibly a matter of taste, but I did not find them as pleasing as the better known Harp concertos."
2,Speedy service but sent the wrong product,I ordered a 9 ND filter but a 3 was sent instead. I did not want to hastle with a return so I will use what was sent but it does impact my rating to two stars.
1,Organ Music in France and Southern Netherlands,"Amazon tells us who the artist is, but the composer is anybody's guess. Then names of the composers mentioned above do not appear on the jacket or the on-screen listing. Looks like Leonhardt wrote all the selections. This is an example of how to take a great idea and make it worthless!!!"
5,I AM A BROWNS FAN BUT I LOVED THIS BOOK,"A BOOK FOR NOTJUST STEELER FANS BUT FOR ALL FOOTBALL FANS. THIS BOOK TAKES US THROUGH THE HISTORY OF THE TEAM, COVERING THE ROONEY FAMILY, PLAYERS, COACHES, AND SEASON TO SEASON RESULTS. IT ALSO HAS MANY EXCELLENT PICS AND STATS AND A GAME BY GAME SCORE FOR EACH SEASON. THIS IS A MUST READ. A TON FOR THE PRICE. FROM THE EARLY DAYS TO THE TERRIBLE TOWEL (MOSTLY A CRYING TOWEL FOR THE OPPONENTS) THIS BOOK IS MARVELOUSLY FILLED WITH FACTS AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE MOST DOMINANT TEAM OF ALL TIME."
1,"slow, slow, slow",I have been waiting to receive this book for almost a month. I will not buy another product from them. I am glad I did not need this book for a gift.
4,Good but I would have liked better control over the flash,Would have liked to be able to use the programs and be able to force the flash on for sunny outdoors portraits. That's only possible in manual mode.
2,Very dissapointed with outcome,"Pictures taken with this camera on the first sunny days of spring produced very disspointing results:Pics were washed out and underexposed.Pics are not sharp enough.Additional issues:Pics enlarged to full size on computer reveal annoying color cast reminiscent of digital video camera frames tranfered to computer.Camera is very heavy.Camera takes 2 minutes to process a nigh shot(F priority mode)!!!!! As you wait for it to finish you cannot use the cam at all, all features are frozen."
4,Expectation to set straight for first time digital SLR owners,"Like many others who have reviewed, I love this camera. For prospective buyers who are looking at the D50 as their first SLR I have an expectation to set.You do not get a preview before taking the shot in the 1.8 inch screen. On recieving my new camera I spent about 30 minutes reading the instructions back to front to see if I could get a preview of the picture I was about to take. All non-SLR cameras give you this facility as standard. It appears that this is either a limitation of digital SLRs or a feature not supported in the D50 camera.All said, I have no regrets buying this camera- it's easy to use and takes awesome shots."
4,Great camera for few money,"This is my first camera in the digital area and I am really happy with the camera. I had a photography course and I really learned how to use it and enjoy it. Currently, I am sure that I can take great pictures, 50% depends on the time you spend creating the scenary, flashs, lights, etc. and 50% on your technic and artistic skills. Honestly, no one needs more than 6 Megapixes, because you can print a great picture 10"" x 8"" with 6MP, so I think this is a great option, and you can invest your extra money buying a tripod, remote control, additional flashes (Really needed and important)."
1,Lemon,"The seller sold me a lemon camera; it stopped working after one use and when I brought it to a repair shop, I was told the aperture mechanism was broken and it would cost more than I paid for the camera to fix it. They told me that it does not break overnight, and I was sold a camera with a loose mechanism that broke after it entered my care. I also purchased a Nikon lens to go with it; I was sent a quantaray lens instead. It's a wonderful camera from what I was able to see but unfortunately I have not been able to use it at all."
4,Great entry-level DSLR,"This is a great camera! I have used it for a 1-1/2 years and I love it. I am a free-lance journalist/artist/photographer and it works for everything except nighttime fires and dark interior shots with no flash. It is a bit slow for shots such as evening deer movement. I have gotten award-winning sunset/sunrise photos with this, as well as wonderful photos of my children both indoors and out. I have also used it for macro photography. For someone who wants an all around camera, this one is perfect -- it is fast, crisp and clear. The colors are wonderful. The kit lenses (18-55 and 55-200) are good. If you want to do serious wildlife photography, you will need to invest in a larger telephoto lens. I routinely enlarge photos I take with this camera to 11x14 with no loss of clarity. Buy a big sd card -- you'll be taking tons of photos!"
5,This Dubet CD is Fantastic!,"I pre-ordered this CD almost a week ago. Yet I still didn't receive the e-mail that my order has been shipped. Anyhow, I download two Hits (just a little girl, misfit) of this album from kazaa. I just love the English accent!Amy Studt is another Anti-Avril."
5,Off the charts...,What an incredible selection of sound(s)...what an incredible voice! This CD is a MUST for any Pop Collection. Well worth the money.
4,Most instrumentally sound YellowCard album to date.,"By ""instrumentally sound"" I mean that I can tell that each guitar, drum, bass, an violin part was well thought out and not just thrown together haphazardly. Everyone was totally expecting another Ocean Avenue: predictable power chords, violin filling every nook and cranny available, and a fast paced beat. I love that YellowCard was able to hold on to creativity immediately following such a successful album like Ocean Avenue. I like Ocean Avenue, but I'm just happy that with nearly 10 album releases to date YellowCard gave us this timeless gem that stands out from their other albums as a not-so-predictable set of songs."
3,LET DOWN,I was looking forward to this album but was pretty disappointed. Some of the songs put me to sleep. Ocean Avenue is such a great album; new Yellowcard fans should buy that instead.
1,this band is as punk as a little pink dress stay away at all costs,"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
5,Lights and there Sounds,"I've been waiting for this cd awhile and it didn't disapoint me.With great songs like Rough Landing,Holly,Lights and Sounds, and Down On My Head where can you go wrong? Go but it."
3,...im not a kid,"basically im dissapointed sort of. I was looking forward to more of songs like only one and back home and i got crap like two weeks from twenty. its solid to say the least however, the best song is clearly, sure thing falling, pretty simply because it sounds like their old stuff the most. but its not a complete waste of 15 dollas ""lights and sounds"" scared me to death because it made me think yellowcard had pulled a ""finch"" and completely changed thier sound for the worst. they havent completely but they need to get back to stuff like october nights. its not fair to compare many albums to ocean avenue but this one doesnt measure up, in about a year ill have forgotten half the songs on this bad boy and still be singing along to only one in my truck."
1,Another New Crap Band,"In the long line of Greenday soundalikes: ""Introducing Yellowcard"".It's a horrible shame that this is the sound of new music.Ok let's not make comparisons to another hundred bands, let's just judge the music on it's own merits.There is nothing of any lasting interest in the melodies.Lyrically, these guys show absolutely no qualities to make them worth a second listen. In fact they're not even worth continuing this review..."
2,Great!! If they work,"This is my second pair of Uniden walkie-talkies. The first pair worked great for about 6 months, then one will no longer charge. So I bought these radios. This time, one of the pair would not transmit, right out of the box. Now I have to return it!!! Functionally Uniden is great. But in terms of quality, I have REAL concerns!!!"
2,Ho hum,"There's no problem with the colorful, durable nature of this puzzle, but it doesn't have much value for a child over the age of 2. Except for learning to recognize which piece of equipment is which and having to manipulate the pieces in order to fit them in the proper places, there's little to hold a child's interest and not much room for expanding the application of skills. It's the least used puzzle we have; all three grandchildren, even the youngest, reach for other toys."
1,bad item,This is neither basic or essential; I was very disappointed as it offers nothing for the beginning GPS user; it seems to be more of an advanced compass course.
1,There are many better translations...,"This book was required reading for my Comparative Religions course in college. I found the teachings of the Dhammapada to be insightful, but the translation was dry and appeared to lack much of Buddha's essence. Out of curiosity, I looked at different translations that were offered online and realized that they were all drastically different and much of the Dhammapada's teachings are changed depending on who has translated the work.I have found better translations than Irving Babbit's book. Out of all Dhammapada books that I have looked at (I am by no means an expert), I found Eknath Easwaran's translation to be much clearer and true to Buddha's teachings.Overall, if you are looking for a good translation of the Dhammapada, this is not the book for you."
4,A Little Below Expectation,"...appears to be printed on a cardboard insert. Good quality cardboard, but still.... if you want the $200 clock, spend the $200. I'm still happy with it for it's particular intended use and can't complain about the price."
1,Box damaged,"The box was damaged and the hardware was lost. Tried to replace the hardware, but couldn't find anything that would fit. This product was worthless to me."
1,Not thrilled,This is the worst I have ever owned...it is not stable because it is bent and not made well..the screws did not fit..It also does not fold..I wasted my money and I bought 2. I have purchased from this company before and I never had a problem however I did with these..by the way claims to hold a lot of clothes ...no way
1,worse than a 99-cent item,"Item arrived in poor packaging; manual was torn and I had to tape it together to read it!!! On top of that, there are missing screws & caps. I had to buy matching screws & caps to complete the assembling. After all, this rack doesn't even stand still. My worst garment organizing product ever!! DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!"
3,What I expected for the price,"I ordered three racks; two were just fine, but the third one I couldn't assemble because it was rusted. Oh well, for $10 a rack, you can expect quality control to be lax..."
1,Missing parts and damaged piece,"The screws and other hardware needed to assemble the rack were missing from the box. In addition, one of the metal pieces was damaged--the paint had been scraped off it in several places. It was a piece of junk."
2,The Wiggles - Wiggle Bay DVD,Not as entertaining for my 2 yr old. More of a story line than other dvd's such as Hoop-Dee-Do. Songs not as catchy. Could not hold her attention for the 45 minutes
5,My kids can't get enough of these guys!,"What i thought was just another attempt to cash in the market turned out to be a video my kids love to watch. The video is about 45 minutes and for kides this a plenty long enough.Unlike the Magical Adventure, this release was shortly after the release in Australia, and it was very enjoyable to watch, even my 1 1/2 year daughter can watch it for hours.I like the story line as it mixes talking with signing and is a break from the usual style of non-stop music. The movie, like the other 2, has a pretty decent plot and the kides seems to follow along.My kids really enjoy it and as a parent I ound it refreshing to find a kids video which teaches some moral values rather than the obligatory and senseless violence.Overall another triumph for the Wiggles."
3,Not my favorite Wiggles DVD,"I was a bit disappointed in Wiggle Bay. The music seemed slow and wasn't catchy enough for my 2 year old. He just doesn't seem to get that Wiggly dancing feeling. It seems rather short, and just didn't compare to some of their other videos.The whole thing being shot on the beach was [weak]. They should have had a set on the beach, or at least done some songs in the studio with a beach theme. Anything to make it more interesting, because this video just seems to lack the energy and excitement that is characteristic of the Wiggles.Our favorite videos so far have been Hoop-Dee-Doo and Wiggly Safari. He loves those and will watch them over and over! I hope the Wiggles make that extra Wiggly effort on their next video to include catchy tunes and a lively set."
3,Not the best,"We love the Wiggles but this DVD just isn't one of their best. Most of the songs are just too...*yawn*...slow. I'd recommend ""Yummy Yummy."" It has a lot more ""moving"" songs that the kids like to dance to."
3,Battery won't charge,"I bought it on sale for 72$ and found it works great with the power-cord, but there was a problem with the battery being dead and not charging for more than a few minutes at a time."
5,Great help for smart kids who aren't successful in school.,"This is an immensely helpful book for parents who have smart children who are lagging behind their peers in learning to read and write. Hannaford maintains that learning should incorporate the entire person -- including lots of movement. Her book offers an overview of what may be occuring neurologically, reassuring anecdotes, helpful excercises and, most importantly, the positive idea that since children learn in different ways and at different times, those who are teaching them must find the right way to teach them. Even children with visual or auditory processing problems can learn the appropriate material if that material is presented focussing on each child's strengths. This book is a good stepping stone for parents, leading them to seek the appropriate help (through the school and perhaps with a neurologist) for their children."
1,Poorly Built,"We used this product for less than a month and the seam on the bottom left step ""blew out"" I tried everything to patch - nothing worked. I tried some vinyl adhesive for shower floors - nothing. I had read a similar review and thought that just maybe that person did not read the directions or something - nope. So very disappointing - $100 bucks down the drain!!!"
3,Looks like fun but do not buy,After one month of use the upper right blue seam tore. Called customer service(the one in California) - took 20 minutes to answer- and they said sorry no warranty no nothing. They gave no help at all. If you call the other number it is someone that does not speak english very well. They did not know what a slide was.If you want it for a short time only then good luck. Makes you wonder what their other products are like. You can tell I am not happy but the company really needs some help.
1,They Do Not Back Their Product,I used this slide one time and the step seam came undone. I called Intex to have a replacement sent and they flat out told me that they have no warranty for this product. I would not buy this product. They flat out do not back their product. Save your money. I am very disappointed.
2,fun but not durable,"I have bought a new one of these each year for my kids and by the end of the season the seams have come apart. For the fun, it was worth it, but now they are near 100lbs and the slide has lasted only a few weeks (and this is on top of me adding water proof duct tape to add extra strength). I am not sure whether they are not making it as well, but it is just not worth the hassle and cost to keep replacing it, unless they started selling them in 6-packs. So while it is fun, I can no longer recommend the slide, especially now it seems they have raised the price quite alot."
2,loved it until it riped,The slide was great until it ripped to soon. not used every day so that was not the case. i tried to patch it up the patch came off and it tore some more.... we are 1/2 way through summer and now have to buy a new slide!we ordered in june it was ruined by july 20th! spend a little more money and get a better slide!
2,Kids LOVED it BUT not very durable!!,"My kids absolutely loved it BUT after playing with it only two times, it had a hole in a seam and was unusable!!"
1,Worthless Product From Day 1,"There are enough bad reviews of this product that I was skeptical. But I took the chance anyway for my little girl. The slide has a hose attachment area where you attach a hose so built-in sprinkler can wet the slide. After spending about 45 minutes blowing this up in the hot sun I was ready. Attached the hose, fired up the water and the sprinklers did their job. For all about 2 minutes - I kid you not. Then the water stopped shooting out and I could hear it filling up the side bladder of the slide so I quickly removed the hose. Then I heard massive amounts of air leaking out from where the hose attaches. There is no way to stop it coming out. No lid, nothing. Apparently the interior hose system was so poorly made that it came undone inside the bladder and now is part of the bladder area. So it will perpetually leak air. Total Piece of ..."
1,Not worth the price!,"I would expect to see this at a discount store for $10. The one we received was horribly manufactured and had defects all over the place. Large scratches, door was badly bent. Shipping box was well packed and not damaged. This was all quality control issues from the manufacturer. Made in China.EDIT: 2/7/8 The Amazon return process was painless.. good job!"
1,BE WARNED - BIG FLAW,"WARNING: Do not buy a new Sony Vaio of any kind with Vista if you want to record any audio off of your sound card - meaning the internet. Sony has permanently disabled the ""wave"" or ""stereo out"" abilities of they're new computers. On all other major brands there is a simple two click solution, but Sony has deemed it in their best interests to make it impossible to reverse. This is a serious and deliberate flaw that they've built into their computers with bigger ""corporate interests"" in mind, not the usefulness of their computers to the average consumer. And they're customer service (what a joke) could care less! As so many have said before me, they have the worst service - it's just horrible. They had no idea what I was talking about and couldn't or wouldn't put me through to someone who could give me any answers. Be warned. See this forum for more information.http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/showpost.aspx?postid=1816948&siteid;=1"
3,Not true to size,I have lymph edema and i was hopeful for these to be the right size..HOWEVER they are small. I wear a 3 x size in other brands and the ones the clinic ordered for me but not this brand. It is a struggle to put them on and I put my finger thru them the first time trying to don them. the ankle is so small I cannot pull them up where they belong... While they are only $20.00 a pair they are still not worth that if they are made wrong.
5,So far so good!,"I mix this with my morning workout suppliment set - Protien, Glutamine, Createne, Beta alanine. Works like a charm :) will probably buy again... if i ever run out in my lifetime."
5,Is doing the trick for my mother's chemo induced neuropathy,"Got it for my mother currently undergoing chemo and radiation, since l-Glutamine is recommended to help against chemo induced neuropathy. This is the second trip around on chemo, and the neuropathy was bad the first time. Much of the feeling still hasn't come back in her feet, and she lost a bit in her hands. Got this to slow the neuropathy down, just to hold it in check, but it looks like this is helping to reverse it since her hands are getting better while she is undergoing chemo. I didn't expect it to work so well, but it has well exceeded my expectations. The other big (unexpected) plus is the improvement in her esophagus which is allowing her to eat without taking numbing medication. I didn't realize this also helps repair digestive system damage, but I found that on further research. Great stuff for cancer patients undergoing chemo!"
3,Better than nothing,This video has some difficult moves and maybe they would be easier if I had started during week 1 of my pregnancy. Overall it's worth it for less than$10 and it gives you 1/2 hr of energizing exercises.
4,What is the thing that keeps me from accelerating to 60 or 70 mph and then letting go of the handlebars?,"I haven't written a poem or anything in several monthsPoncho tweeted `sometimes i miss you like i don't hate you'I read that this morningI ride a motorcycle in the rain when it is 27 degreesIt is nite and I whisper to the bike, `spring is coming soon'Seriously I do thisBikes are temperamental I thinkThe muffler doesn't like being so cold and then so hot and so onAna sends me a youtube video on g-chat and I accidentally see a recent photograph of you when I'm looking at things on facebook and think `oh god' but not with any wordsYou are definitely wearing your husband's shirtYou definitely seem to beI watch out the windowMy roommate driving awayI write to ana, `what is wrong with this poem besides the whole thing? you don't have to answer this'It is definitely very cold outside"
2,"Man, why did I buy this album for?","I'm so sorry that I bought this album. Of course, the hit single ""stuntin like my daddy"" was jammin!! But, I thought I could get more into the rest of the album. I just could not do it. I will admit though. I do like Birdman's swagger. If Lil wayne could use more of his own rhymes instead of others, then he would be better. I got tired of hearing lil wayne's annoying delivery on a lot of the songs. I got Birdman's last album and I liked more songs on that one than this one. Save your money and buy something better, like that Trae's Restless album. Now, that's much better."
3,No volume control for the ringer = migraine,"First of all, the phone works just fine . . . as a phone.The annoying parts follow:- The ringer only has one volume setting: Loud as blazes.- The LCD readout blinks constantly and only has one brightness setting: Bright as blazes.- For some reason, whenever we retrieve messages, each one is always proceeded by a voice saying ""power failure!""Annoying as . . . well, annoying as blazes.So, if you're blind, mostly deaf, and like a regular update on your phone's power, by all means buy it."
4,Artsy kind of zombie flick,"Messiah of Evil is not your typical zombie horror movie in that there is almost no gore at all. This movie follows the story of a woman searching for her father who lives in a coastal town called Point Dume. Most of the people in this town have been changed due to a prophesy that is coming to pass. This movie has been released over the years under many different titles such as Dead People, among others. This movie has a slower pace to it, and it has a strange almost art film quality. There are a couple standout scenes such as in a supermarket meat counter and a really great scene in a movie theatre. This movie is worth watching if you are a fan of 70's horror movies and like stylish horror over gore alone."
3,Night Of The Living Dead meets Easy Rider,"Exceptionally disturbing cannibal zombie flick about a town that turns on it's ear and becomes purely populated by flesh eating zombies every hundred years or so when the moon turns red and a certain dark stranger returns to visit. Corny monologues, bad acting, and lousy theme song aside, this flick holds your attention from beginning to end."
1,Bad product,The threads on the knee area are gone. There is also a hole on the foot after two weeks of use. Do not recommend it.
1,not for professonal,I was very disappointed from this book. As someone that does hair and make up for living I could not find one useful thing in it . There are no new looks or idea and the tips are all old and ell known. and the pictures are of prodactes and not models I was disapionted to see the big letters used as if to take more space to say nothing.
1,NEVER RECEIVE,I HAVE NEVER RECEIVE THE ALBUMPerhaps another person who make benefice on Michael's DeathIt's a shame
5,Exceptional!,"The Amazon editorial reviewer Steven Mirkin is way off base about this album. Some of Michael's masterpieces such as Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song, Tabloid Junkie, Scream. Money, They Don't Care About Us, Childhood and Smile are on this CD. This is a MUST HAVE. And the History 2 DVD is simply awesome and also a must have. No one made videos like Michael did. They're all masterpieces. This is a great collection of some of his very best videos."
3,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO why??? WHY isn't ""smooth Criminal"" on here???","To tell the truth, I'm a bit dissapointed with this set.Why?I mean, there's great classics on here, and ""Scream"", the duet with his sister(also a classic by the way),BUT, where is ""Smooth Criminal""? I had purchased this 2 cd set without even looking to see what tracks it had, i was assuming it had everything,it just doesn't have my fave MJ song of all time. That's why I didn't give this ""HIStory""(fer cryin out loud, his history was that song), the 5 stars.I did give it 3 for the new material thats on the second disc and for the timless classics. A great,NOT PERFECT ""HIStory""."
3,"Fast Shipping, but Bad Packaging","Arrived quickly, however, there was bad packaging- the cd case ended up being cracked and there was a huge scratch on the CD- it works ok, but maybe needs some bubble wrap or something..."
3,YUCK,"I will ignore the first disc because any real fan will have all these old hit on MJs first four Epic albums. Missing on disc one are many gems like Girlfriend and Baby be Mine which is why all true fans listen to the original album, not hits packages. There are some tracks on disc 2 that are good- three of them to be exact ( the first 3 tracks Scream, They dont Care, Stranger in Moscow), Earth Song is pure Megalomania but tolerable. The rest of the album will leave you feeling like a washed out morphine addict which is apparently what MJ was when he recorded the Album. This album was supported by the very successful but truly disappointing History Tour. Michael treats his fans like enemies in this album, it is a statement to his detractors not a party album for his followers. This is where The Legend Discontinues..."
5,awesome,"this is the best album ever. It shows his past, present and future. The songs are wonderful and his emotions are coming out. I am askingfor this album for christmas. MJ fans, you should buy History: Past, Presnt and Future. Trust me, you will enjoy it"
5,Great Michael Jackson CD Set!,"The first disc has the songs that I really know and love, while the second disc has some songs that I know a little but have grown to love now. I'm really glad that I've FINALLY purchased it because it's great to play in the car on a long trip or on the computer while you work. I would strongly recommend this CD set to anyone who loves or could and wants to grow to love Michael Jackson's music."
5,Great Find,I was able to research and purchase exact item I'd been seaching for. Item arrived in pristine condition. I could not be happier. Thanks.
5,A great collection of songs,"This is a great cd set , comes in a very nice case, and the songs are all great.I am very glad I bought it."
4,It is a legend that cannot be denied.,"I believe Michael Jackson is one of the most creative innovators of music ever to live. This album is a classic. Every single song on the CD is either good or spectacular. Michael couldn't have lived in a better era than this, when people need to stop talking about guilt which has not been proven (those ugly charges of child abuse.) I am anxiously anticipating the return of Michael to America with the dawn of his seventh album. Number seven is always good to me, as it will be for him. Bring on the stuff, Michael, and continue to do your thing that you do."
4,The lords of flatburh,"This is a good movie, it has alot of old cars it in the movie.I bought it for my husband for christmas."
5,A Great CD.,"This is a great CD. I don't usually listen to the radio but happened to have it on between CD's and heard, Just Might Have Her Radio On. When I returned home, I found the video on Youtube, then searched other songs by Trent. There were several great songs on the CD, and quickly purchased it. Trent has a amazing talent for singing moving songs. Can't wait until his next CD is released."
4,Worth reading,"This is a fun series that I enjoy. I look forward to the next in line.I would recommend this series for someone new to sci-fi as it is not real heavey with the techy bits, (enless you like all the techy bits then read something else.)This is a good series for teens and adults.I recommend this book."
1,Save your money!!!,"I found no difference whatsoever in signal strength after using this devise. I think its a total waste of money! If this actually worked, all the phone manufacturers would have started installing this before selling their devices.SCAAAAM !!!"
4,"Excellent book, CD much more convenient","This book is a great resource for the new or experienced DBA. With so many configuration options and infrequently used features it is nice to have one source for all of this information.Also, the CD which accompanies the book makes carrying the book and searching it much faster."
4,"Good content, bad formatting in Kindle version","I purchased this book for an Oracle class I'm taking an so far the content has been good. However, I got the kindle version of the book, which was a mistake in hindsight due to the poor formatting of text. SQL examples are not formatted correctly and even some of paragraphs don't have spacing in between them.I would definitely buy this book again, just in a hard copy form."
4,Great Reference,The ORACLE DATABASE 10g Complete Reference book is not disapointing. Like most reference books by ORACLE it gives you a great understanding and reference to utilize. I have yet found an ORACLE book that has let me down.
1,One Minute Guide To Spiritual Flim Flam,"It is sad and unfortunate that a book by a so-called enlightened master, who promises powerful ""secret teachings"" in matters of prosperity and spiritual guidance has authored such a sham of a book.The book is nothing more than a cleverly devised marketing pitch for Sri Siva's endless array of CD's, prayer beads, Homas, etc.There are however, a couple of key areas in the book that place emphasis on the importance of meditation and the benefits of positive thoughts--but little else in the form of credible, spiritually useful techniques.In my opinion, it's an insult to any reader looking to uncover valuable guidance on matters of prosperity.If this is indeed the ""Guru"" who inspired Wayne Dyer, we should all be greatly alarmed!Steer clear of this shameful and disappointing book."
1,Eats batteries,"We purchased this item last year (Christmas 2006) for one of our boys. They were very excited to recieve it as it contains cool bells and whistles and hi-tech design. However, I can tell you that after having this item for almost a year now, my advice is to avoid at all costs. The safe eats batteries (need to replace every 3-4 weeks) and when the batteries fail, the safe sends out an audible alarm. After being woken up in the middle of the night a few times to the sound of this thing going off, we decided to remove the batteries. This thing now sits on my son's dresser, completely worthless."
1,Disappointing gift,"I ordered this safe for my grandson after he e-mailed me a very accurate request. Unfortunately, we discovered on Christmas Eve, when he opened it, that it was inoperable. I have given his parents the return information and labels."
5,Great product,I bought these as a gift. I have other Rada products and love them. Would recommend buying the sharpener with them. I would not want to give mine up.
5,The Truth about Reagan,"This book is very easy to read and at the same time documents how Ronald Reagan helped to defeat communism and end the cold war. Using documents from the former Soviet Block as well as sources here, the author shows how Reagan defeated communism.The book clearly shows that Reagan was concerned about communism and developed a plan of action from the time he was an actor and that he was far more than the empty suit the liberals will want you to believe. This was a great book that tells the truth about Reagan, a truth many of us already knew but many on the far left will never admit. This book should be required reading for anyone interested in recent history. Reagan was a great president and this book shows just one reason why. Complement this book with the recent collections of Reagan's letters for an accurate portrait of this great leader."
1,Onguard Vinyl Boots,"These boots are unusable for my purposes because they lack any foot support whatsoever. They will be given to Goodwill, because they are worth as much as a tax deduction as the costs of return. The sellers rate five stars for their service, but the quality of the boots is unproven. They have strong PVC odor; boots might be servicable to someone who needs no comfort and expects no foot support or comfort. They fit loosely, and might accommodate being worn with shoes."
5,Anesthesia book,Great book for learning and reviewing anesthesia for horses.Has the basic parameters which are handy to have. A little datedas it contains Hathone info but still a great resource.
5,worth every dollor,lights and sound is the best so far from yellowcard... all of their albums are soo good i have all of them. This is the lastest of yellowcard since 2003 Lights and Sounds is a great and has 14 songs its cheap
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Poet killer case for transform detective.A detective gets assigned the investigation into why a famous poet went whacko and dispatched a few people.She herself is an animal-human hybrid of sorts, which, in passing some people are not too fond or (and they themselves may not be too fond of normal people).The whole book itself doesn't gel all that well, maybe because it is something a little different for Bear, perhaps.Those people who have to have someone they like in a book to read it can avoid this one, too."
5,Stick with it - it's worth it,"After the first 30 pages I suspected something was wrong so I flipped to the blurbs on the covers and flyleaf: ""ambitious"" ""challenging"" ""complex"" -- uh oh!There are some wierd syntactical treatments that make for rough reading: the absence of commas, unusual phrasing... but eventually you train yourself to defocus on these sections and just let the words shower down on you... maybe that was Bear's intent.I loved Slant, and was excited to discover this prequel based in the same universe and featuring Mary Choy, but this novel makes Slant seem pretty mainstream. There are ""Big Ideas"" here that are really worth the read, and I am in amazement of the complexity and maturity of the thought: it's like Bear had been saving up decades of thought on the nature of consciousness, the subconscious, guilt, and punishment, and was finally letting fly.I eventually decided that this was a great novel. Keep going. It's worth it."
5,Probably the greatest sci-fi book ever written,"Like a lot of Bear's books, you'll need to read it twice to understand it but it Will be the best book you have ever read. I've read it 3 times now and look forward to the next time. This is a work by a master at his high point. If you like hard sci-fi, then you're home. Read this and then read Slant for a slightly less satisfying read but a continuation of M.Choy's journey."
2,just not there,I could not get into this book. The characters did not draw me in and hold me. The language was sometimes confusing and you get these + signs that I never quite got. I read about 100 pages of this and put it down. It may finish stronger but to me it was not worth the time to get there.
2,What's the message?,"This story is told from the point of view of three characters; a police officer assigned to find a murderer, a friend of the murderer, and a therapist assigned to examine the murder. Another story line about a robot mission to a planet in another galaxy is thrown in. The stories are loosely connected but really go in different directions. It's really three short stories thrown together. The story about the police officer was the most interesting followed by the therapist's. The friend's story was the most boring. None of the stories really have much of a resolution. Overall, it seems Bear was trying to say something about the nature of sentiency. However, I wasn't able to determine exactly what he was trying to say about it. I can't recommend this book because the author's message seems to be lost and the stories are only moderately interesting in their own right."
2,Leave It To Beaver-2nd Season,"Though I could view all the episodes, this DVD collection seems to have been pirated!! There are no labels on the DVDs and they are much thicker than other DVDs. I put one in a player [like those in a vehicle without a tray that slides out] and it jammed my player. This was in a camper and the entire unit had to be replaced. OUR COST $700!!!! This has never happened to any other DVDs we have. Needless to say, all of the series of LITB will NOT be played on our new one. We only play these in players that have a tray that slides out now."
5,Great Show - Safe for the Kids to watch (no garbage) - PLEASE RELEASE SEASON THREE!!!!!!!!!!!,"These episodes are so funny and Beaver always learns a lesson. Sometimes it is also the parents that learn a lesson which helps me to grow as a parent. My kids like watching, too. I feel that I do not have one worry when they watch these dvd's. I rarely watch the network shows on TV today because I do not like all the garbage the media is trying to expose my young kids to. I even have to worry about the commercials. Sometimes they advertise CSI or Ghost Whisperer, etc. and I have to worry if my kids will wake up at night with nightmares, etc. from the horrible footage shown on TV in just a short commercial, not to mention the possible long term effects on their minds. Leave it to Beaver is fun, safe, entertaining for all. I WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE RELEASE MORE SEASONS ON DVD!!!!!!!!!"
5,Brings back memories,"This series brought back so many memories of what television used to be, before all the violence, nudity, and foul language. Back when you could watch a program with your children and not have to change the channel due to content. Each episode taught a lesson in moral values and did it in such a way as to keep you laughing. I can hardly wait until my grandsons are old enough to watch them with me, just as my sons and I did."
1,JUNK.,"Took it out of the box, filled it up, primed the pump, and... nothing. Messed with it for about a half an hour. The spring inside was bent, which I finally fixed, but it made no difference. The one dollar disposable soap dispensers from the grocery store work better than this thing. Now I have to decide if it's worth draining it and mailing it back. I find it hard to believe that one of these would work for more than a few months - it's very cheaply made so even if it had initially worked I'd expect it to break pretty quickly.Also, the top and bottom of this are black plastic. I couldn't tell from the photo and was hoping they would look a little nicer and more substantial in person, but they don't. This is all around just cheap, cheap, cheap junk!"
4,Nice Soap Dispenser for the kitchen!,I have had this soap dispenser for a few months. It is not cheaply made and has a non-skid bottom. I like it clear so that I know how much soap is inside. Also the size and look is great! I just put it at the cornerabove my kitchen sink and it instantly made my outdated kitchen look a bit more modernized :)! The down side is the pump is a little difficult to press. Other than that it is a great buy!
1,Broke Easily- Huge Mess,"I had this dispenser for a few months- worked well and held so much soap I didn't have to refill it until last night. While filling it, I dropped it about 6 inches into the sink and the entire bottom broke off! The whole container of dish soap went down the drain and splattered over my counter. As an eco-conscious person, I found this very disturbing and wasteful. I recommend getting a dispenser that doesn't have a separate bottom- doesn't make sense!"
2,Progressive Soap Dispenser,"I love the look and material of this product, except the pump goes bad fast. I bought a few to use all around my house and found that the kitchen and bathroom ones have a bad pump now. With usage, the pump gets stuck and the top does not bounce back up for you to press again to dispense more."
1,The first one leaked. Then I decided to give it another try and the second one leaked too,The first one leaked. Then I decided to give it another try and the second one leaked too. I am not happy with the product to put it in nice words.
5,Great!,Had it for a few months now and love it. Easy to use. Love the long nose. Hasnt leaked!Looks really nice on the sink too.
1,Garbage,Worst purchase ever. Looks nice but that's about it. Pump does not work at all. The soap pumps sold in groceries work better than this. Save your $$$.
2,Really cheap item...,"The picture promoting this pin looks ten times better than the real thing. Really poor, cheap looking tin metal pin. It even came all scratched regardless it was shipped in a bubble envelope. Not even worth the 1.50 I payed for it much less the extra bucks for the shipping."
2,not that great of a game,"i was extremely happy about getting this game but it just isn't that fun, the story is good, the action is good for a while but it lacks the simple but important act of being fun from second to second, the guns are very uninteresting, when u do get a new one its fun for a battle or two, then you're bored. you do get a great one three quarters into it but there's never enough ammo for it so its back to that same gun all the aliens have, the simple truth is it isn't fun, which is a huge disappointment. i really wanted to like this game, i loved quake 4 and others like it but this isn't one of them"
2,It was great until it wasn't,"I loved this thing! And then one day when I was gently removing it from my bag, one of the buttons popped off. Without the buttons, what's the point? I just recently thought to yank off the other button, and now I fold the flap inside the case, so it still works, but it's just not the same. Without the red buttons, it no longer looks deceptively like an inter-office memo. Sad times. I'd recommend going for one in the same style by another brand. The boxwave is the best looking, but those may have better button-life. And they're cheaper.Macvelope, Grantwood Technology's Envelope Case for MacBook Air, FITS NEW 11"" MACBOOK AIR"
5,the BEST of the Hooked on Classics series,This is my favorite of all the Hooked on Classics series. I would highly recommend it and the rest of the set. They're great to listen to and educational at the same time! Enjoy!!
2,"Bloody Sad (with the emphasis on ""bloody"")","While a well-filmed documentary with lots of good penguin footage, it can't go 5 or 6 minutes without showing ample blood and gore, making it a less-than-ideal gift for a penguin-lover. We know penguins have it rough, but that can easily be conveyed through narration rather than (repeatedly) showing them dying horrible deaths. Overall, a depressing film."
5,One of his finest,"Dostoevsky is, by far, my Favorite author. This book is certainly one of the best four books of his. the others being 'Brothers Karamazov' 'Idiot' and 'Devils'. It is certainly a chief competitor for the role of the most wicked, pathetic, hopeful and hopeless book ever. (the others of dostoevsky would surely be among the other competent competitors). One of the reviewers wrote that Dostoevsky should have been a Psychologist. There is nothing more farther than the truth. Psychology is about the belief in the order of things. This book's main issue is probably the futility of rationalism. When i first read this book i was taken into it that in one point - when the Hero did something (i won't spoil) near the end I had to drop the book - because i could not bare the moral horror. Dostoevsky reveals the most terrible of all horrors which is the moral one. i was sweating and breathing hard - and i had to take a long break before i could get back. this book is like a fervent maelstrorm."
2,Get a Different Translation of this Incredible Book!,The Mirra Ginsburg translation is the worst translation of this book. I would recommend the Richard Pevear & Larissa Volokhonsky translation.
3,Nice and horrible!,"The petal pixies are nice(I have the same petal pixies but with pink&purple; tails instead of green&yellow;)but the big Barbielooks like a ghost! Mattel usually does bad toys.I wouldn`t recommend this because I`ve seen better.Moreover, Barbies don`t have very nice legs."
5,An Awesome Truth...,"You know after reading so many books out there regarding relationships, I was looking desperately for one that came from the soul of a brother. A friend of mines who purchased this book in Atlanta referred this to me, and as I began reading, I noticed that this novel was very different from a lot of the novels today. I must say, it takes a lot of courage for a man to shed his layers in order to find truth. I cried so much! I fanned myself while reading the love scenes. I grew so angry at both William McCall (For hanging on to a love lost) and Andrea (How could you do this to him???). But is that what good novels do?To think: this was his first book. I hope for many, many more from this emerging talent."
4,A 360 degee look......,"This book was one of the better books I've read in sometime. I enjoyed the truthful way the author played out *William McCall's* feelings. I never thought I could put down a book and seach within myself to want to find a fella like William. I thought romance was dead. LOL! I enjoyed the journey(s) this book took me on. I laughed, cried, got angery and confused ..right along with Mr.McCall. I learned what a *Black man would do in the mist of being in love. I enjoyed the highs and lows it took him. I'm seaching for my *William McCall* A brother who has a good heart from the door. Thanks Mr.Cooper for this fresh of breath air. I enjoyed this book and I'm looking to the next piece you drop."
2,louisiana info wrong,"boring.slow.long.[i like slow movies if they go somewhere, this one didn;t]the american part is supposed to be in east texas.but the bayou shots don;t look like texas.and the 'dance hall' is clearly the rock'n'bowl in new orleans.at least the band was good and authentic - zydeco force - even ifthey were only on stage for 30 seconds.then, as everyone else has said, he dies.about time.i thought it would never be over.wle."
4,Ingmar Bergman does accordion,"I'm not even sure where to start with this one. I liked it, but I fear it will have an extremely limited audience in the United States. It's one of the most European of all the European movies I've seen. Someone accustomed to American films will be bored to death. In some ways, I think that this makes it particularly effective in conveying just how foreign America and its music is to the title character, though."
2,Dullsville,"These performances are well done but very dull. They almost completely lack the panache and style that makes Mozart's party music endearing to 21st century ears.Each of the four Divertimenti on the first CD -- Nos. 8, 13, 14 and 16 -- is tastefully done but boring. The great Serenad 11, K. 375, is better but not enough to save this collection. Serenade 12, K. 388, lacks the drama necessary in this music and fails in the same way as most of the others.I'd say Sony made a wise decision withdrawing this set, where everything is played well and the sound is outstanding. Unfortunately, there is not a single memorable performance in this collection, which is utterly forgettable."
3,Sewing for the Home,"Bought as a gift for my daughter, at her request. From quickly looking through it, it seemed up to date in terms of projects and techniques."
4,Some Gems in here,"I have my reservations about some of Nylands methodology. However, he was on top of the the connection between various European peoples and the Basque long before mainstream academics were. He made the claim that Welsh and some other languages/peoples had connections to Basque. Mainstream scholars laughed at him. However, genetic studies proved that there was something that needed to be looked at very carefully here. For example, the Welsh people have a high frequency of Y-chromosomes very similar to those found among the Basque. This was not predicted by mainstream linquists-but it was predicted by Nyland."
3,Fun for a week then give to a friend,"This game seemed so addictive once you play it a few times, but then it was like never anything different.. I'm going to give it to a friend.. So yes fun to have and enjoy but hte addiction doesn't last long"
5,The kids love it!,My 9 and 12 year old (especially my 12 year old) love this game. They will play it for hours. It has many levels which keep their attention. I highly recommend this game.
5,Cake Mania Delux,This game is excellent. Its a little more involved than Diner Dash. It is very challenging to make cake with frostings and different shapes and lightning speed while customers wait. You can buy new equipement to help make them better and faster. My whole family loves this game. I would recommend it.
1,Very displeased with the product,The covering is very poor quality and it started shedding badly right after we received the toy. It is especially bad aroung the seams and we had to take it away from our granddaughter due to it's shedding. We were afraid she would try to put it in her mouth. It's not safe for younger folks.
5,Momunental Concerto Collection,"Talk about a premier collection! The likes of Stern, Casals, Tabuteau performing J.S. Bach concertos!This is fabulous stuff, eloquently and passionately played!"
4,foley is THE MAN !!,"this book was a wonderful fallow up to his first book. tells why he decided to write his OWN biography (his first book) and continues on with his ups and downs in his very good career with the wwf, or now known as wwe. mick foley has a very humorus side to him which he shows as much as ever in this fallow up book. has very interesting points that point to the real world really BEING faker than pro wrestling! more wonderfull stories,about life and wrestling. i guess the only down of this book could be the fact that he goes from one subject to the other. doesnt seem hard to fallow though! shouldnt let that be a reason to stop one from getting a very insightful book. highly reccomended!"
4,Not as good as the first,"After three days of non-stop reading I finally finished Foley is Good, and although the majority of the book was really enjoyable, this book was no where as good as the first book. Infact sadly the last third of the book is a bit of a let down and kind of boring, he just stops talking about wrestling and goes off in a number of different topics. Another problem I had with this book is Royal Rumble 2000 and Wrestlemania 2000 seem to be missing. On the plus side Foley finally discusses the one thing missing from his first book DRUG USE. I guess the reason Royal Rumble 2000 and Wrestlemania 2000 are missing is I guess Mick Foley is thinking of writing a third book, that would be interesting"
5,The title says it all.,"When you think of pro wrestling, you may think of big, bucked tooth people throwing fake punches and landing on a giant trampolion. You're ignorant if you think that. I am a huge fan myself, and I know that Mick Foley is one of the greatest. If you read Foley Is Good, you will know what I am talking about. The book picks up where the last left off. It talks about everything from injuries to sex. It is a very wisecracking book that left me on the floor laughing, and the final chapter is about the communist PTC, and how they hate the thursday show WWF Smackdown! Read this book, you will be incredibly supprised that the real world is faker than wrestling."
3,scattered,Being a wrestling fan and a fan of mick foley. I bought this book without a second thought. Once I got into it I started to have mixed feelings. The good is that it is very informative and humorous. The bad is that Foley can't seem to keep his writing on track. It as if he wrote whatever came to his mind. Some might find this interesting but it makes me wonder if he really proofread it. This book could have easily cut out 50 pages of junk. However I still enjoyed it.
3,not as good as long distance,"most of the runrig c.d.'s are individually better than this as it IS an easy way for the record company to make extra money from the band. There is a new c.d. out now with the new lead singer, Bruce Guthro, a French-Canadian. He has a superb voice and complements the band. BUY IT !!!"
2,new cd,"When I did my review last August, I did not put the title of the new cd in, it is ""In Search of Angels. Excellent!"
2,Mental Poisoning,"I found this book to be highly overrated and overpriced. It is an old book, fairly archaic in language and the author takes up too much space explaining one or two examples of his point rather than utilizing the entire book to illustrate many examples of his point."
2,Save your money and use common sense.,"There's nothing wrong with the book, really. But if you have the smallest nugget of common sense and can look up fun activities, review cheap hotels (if there is such a thing in NYC), and avoid expensive restaurants by doing some research online then you've pretty much left the book useless. I figured out more information on my own that the book was able to give me, although I love Fromer's and know that they gave the best information."
2,The workout is trying to stay balanced,"For something so simple, you work harder on trying to keep your balance than anything else. Don't try to twist on it without shoes, it will hurt your feet. I tried to watch tv and twist (great concept), but you will twist around in a circle, and you work trying to stay facing forward and keep balanced. Otherwise, you just twist in a circle until you get tired. You may get better balance on a solid surface like vinyl, wood or tile flooring, but the carpet will test your balance."
5,Salad Bowl Set,"I am very pleased with this product and the shipping was fast. I have been looking for a wooden salad bowl sets as a gift for an upcoming birthday, but I've found prices anywhere from 40.00 on up to 99.00$. I love the rich cherry finish of this set and it comes with 4 salad bowls and serving tongs. I am going to give this set with a Salad cookbook. It really makes a great, thoughtful gift for someone that entertains and loves to cook. I personally have a wooden salad bowl and Love it ! Makes serving green salads or pasta salads look chic and stylish."
4,Very pretty,"A sweet and simple story in a beautiful book for kids who are observant. Map at the front of the book shows the route the children walk, all the way to the suprise at the end.We liked Lindsay Barrett George's ""Box Turtle at Long Pond"" book, and this book showcases her signature style of lillustrating the natural world.I live in the Arizona desert. Any chance for a book about a high pine forest, Mrs. George? I'll keep my fingers crossed)."
3,a pocket wonder let down by a lousy editor or printer,"This book is a little gem. After years of looking for a simple source of recipes for yer basic Dutch (including Dutch-Indonesian) recipes - speculaas, hasjee and so on - finding it was a real 'Eureka' moment. Even Ditte Kummer's no-nonsense illustrations made plain it was the real thing (very Dutch!). It was only as I first tried to follow its speculaas recipe - with ingredients all over the worktop - that I discovered some sloppy copy-editing or printing had obviously omitted ingredients from some of the recipes. A bit of lateral thinking helped rescue the situation, but it's a plain shame that such a little beauty of a book should be damaged in this way. Still *very* well worth a look, and the only thing of its type I know in English, but...we-e-e-l...someobody somewhere fell asleep at the wheel, and I don't think it was the author!"
5,Why did I wait so long?,"Superb video and audio quality compared to my notebook built in garbage. Good light sensitivity, angle of view and I can tilt it independently of screen now (my notebook screen angles suck, but that is another story). Inconveniences? There are some. You have to carry it around, attach cable to USB port and it sticks out so can not close lid with it mounted. But I can live with that for now. Main thing I can clearly see now. Bought several for relatives as well to use with Skype."
4,Excellent with one exception...,"This camera is excellent. Way smaller that what I expected. Incredible image. And I was really picky about image quality. It's perfect. The only flaw is that it doesn't stay on my laptop correctly, so I have to use the stand it came with (thank god)But overall, it's an awesome webcam. Extremely clear! Takes really nice pictures, videos, and cool accessory options!"
1,Didn't work upon arrival,When I got this product it didn't work - absolutely no response from 4 different PCs. Oh well!!
4,good camera - but won't stay still,"I found this camera easy to install and hook-up. It runs beautiful video. The major problem with this webcam is, it won't stay firmly clipped to the monitor of the laptop the way it shows in the picture. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to everyone as being an excellent product."
5,Pleased as Punch,"My children and grandchildren recently moved to Brisbane, Australia. It is a tough separation but thanks to the fine quality of the C905 webcam we are able to closely keep in touch and actually experience the growth of our grandchildren. The C905 is a great product, easy to install, a pleasure to use, and Amazon makes it very affordable."
4,Good Camera..,"This is a nice, portable camera for the price. I did have difficulty with the software. The customer service department was great in helping resolve these issues. If you have any problems, suspect the software first!"
4,Amazing Webcam!,This is an amazing little camera! It's small and very easy to use my only complaint is that it doesn't clip correctly on my laptop... It tends to get annoying... But I deal. Because It's awesome! I'm always in low lighting and that little guy really brightens things up for me! Let's just say it's great for what I paid for it!
5,Excellent webcam for laptops,This is an excellent webcam for laptops. The install and operation have gone smoothly. The Logitech software works well. After the purchase and use of this one went so smoothly we went out and purchased their QuickCam Pro 9000 for our desktop as well.
4,Excellent quality camera,"This is the first webcam I own, and I'm very impressed with it. The quality of the image, both video and photo, is really good. I like the fact it has a photo feature too. It tilts up and down but I wish it could turn right and left a little easier."
5,great camera for any laptop that doesn't have one built in.,I brought this for a new laptop that I used while working in Africa. It set up easily and worked perfectly with skype and yahoo/google messenger. I was able to communicate with my wife and children from Africa with ease. I have also used it on an old laptop that my mother-in-law has so she can skype with her grandkids 3 states away. It works great and is well worth the money.
4,It's alright for starters,Quality is ok for low resolution pictures and video but the highest quality makes the video slower and it skips.The downside was the very short cable which is maybe 2 or less feet long. It might be good for laptops but not for PCs or Macs.I use it occasionally for skype so it meets my needs. Picture filters make the video chat fun at times.Recommended for started but don't expect too much.
4,great cam but lame software,"rec'd webcam from Amazon on time and in good order. However after installing software, camera wouldn't work. Called tech support ( foreign country--hard to understand) and finally determined Software out of the box was version 1.1----latest ver 2.1. After download from logitech new software did the trick. Using software had no instructions so your on your own. Happy with webcam---disappointed with Logitechs poor documentation. A lot of patience needed.Ken"
3,Had wrong pic,The site showed me a picture of a perfume bottle. It still smells pretty good though. Was trying to revisit fond memories of when I was younger.
3,Man is this different!,I was very surprised when i heard this album..i thought to myself this can not be the band that made Embers to inferno and ascendancy..This album is a complete different sound witch i didn't take the change to good..cause no matter how much i wanna like it it just does not catch me..I understand that alot of bands have tons of other bands that inspired them and made them wanna create music but there is no need to become its clone..Yes i think they wanted to sound just like Metallica. Its not all bad but its not gonna blow you out of your seat the way the First two albums did..Hope They go back to there old sound cause they were bringing some very much needed uniqueness to a dying genre....crossing my fingers.I give it three stars cause thow whole album is not bad i dig a few of the tracks and no matter how different it sounds They just throw down so hard behind there instruments the music is insane but its just not trivium.
4,Not Afraid To Be Old-School,"Yes, it's true that it sounds as if Trivium has spent the last year listening to old Metallica CDs over and over before recording this album. BUT...let it be said by someone (me) that I hear the influence of another 80's thrash band even more: Testament. There are moments here that would fit perfectly on Testament's ""Practice What You Preach.""This is a great kick-butt CD, though. It's refreshing to hear a band stay heavy, but dispose of the ""cookie-monster-vocals"" for once."
3,Someone please offer some assistance with the lyrics.,"I give this record three stars for some great songs-- there are about four of them-- and some clear musical talent.That said, these guys need some major help in the lyrical department. Most songs on here sound disjointed and/or forced, and a couple are just plain stupid (the ""daughter slaughter"" song and the heavy metal take on Bruce Springsteen's ""41 Shots"" are both painful).It doesn't help that some of the riffs are taken right out of early Metallica tab books.If you find this album for ten bucks or less, buy it. ""Ignition"", ""Anthem"", and a couple of others really are solid songs. Download them or find this one cheap."
2,Not the same.,"I wouldn't consider myself a fan of Trivium, but I have been following the metal scene for quite a while.Trivium has chosen a new direction with this album. Their touring connection to Metallica and Iron Maiden (see the album's liner notes) has probably played a major role in their pursuit of a similar sound. I speculate that Roadrunner Records also put pressure on this group to create a more mainstream album. The label has been dropping its heavier acts and signing bands like Megadeth that do not fit with their previous brand image.This album is a disappointment to old fans, especially my friend Peter. If it were released at a different time, I would not have the option of saying, ""These guys are trying to sound like Avenged Sevenfold"". Unfortunately, I just did."
4,Not Their Best Work,"It does have the usual Trivium elements to it, but its not as heavy as their other albums. They still have their insane solos and the last song is a wonderful instrumental. I'd recommend it if you're a Trivium fan, but buy one of their other albums first."
2,nothing noticeable on lashes,"I used this product on my lashes for over 3 consecutive months, applying every evening religiously. I saw absolutely no difference in lash growth or health. Also, you definitely need a precision brush to apply this stuff, it can be messy. I forked over the money for Revitalash, even though it does not contain the same formulation to stimulate long lashes like Latisse. Revitalash still yields noticeable results--lashes are longer (but not ridiculously longer like with Latisse) and they seem to stay healthy and long even after you stop using it (not so with Latisse--newly grown eyelashes will fall out!).My recommendation: save your money, or fork over a little more on another product for visible results."
1,awful audio quality,"Little Feat is one of my favorite bands, and it would have been wonderful had the material on these discs been the result of better presentation. There are many bands which have issued live or archival material with less-than-perfect audio quality, but I've never heard an official release where the material is so painful to listen to. It's sad if this is the best material they have -- that's a real loss to the many people who love Little Feat. Really, this material should never have been released."
2,Lots of static,One of the radios had such a static-like reception that nothing can be heard from it. The battery life is only about four hours. I don't recommend these radios to any one.
5,Awesome,I really find it helpful and easy to use with so much new features. and i recommend it for every one who wanna have dictionary.
5,Chosing Right,"What a wonderful story, so well told and so well illustrated. It's about a woman who chooses the useful over the decorative, and then, at every opportunity, employs her useful shovel to grow food, have fun, help animals, and help people. If you're looking for a book about choices, or a book that shows what a woman can accomplish, that is not preachy in any way. If you're looking for a book that tells of the passing of seasons and the changes in life, choose this book."
1,4th DVD was misrecorded,"The DVD set is great until the 4th DVD - half way through , during the last mountain stage, the recording changed to some documentary from the 2004 Tour. Missing the last 5 stages took a little out of the Tour."
3,"""a title"" - Richmen & Boston rock fans","There was a second guitar player at some point in the original Modern Lovers. Jonathan Richman, Ernie Brooks, David Robinson (later of the Cars), Jerry Harrison (later of the Talking Heads & producing fame), & a childhood friend of Jonathan's named John Felice. ""Nothing Pretty"" rocks as hard as the first Modern Lovers album & John's voice isn't quite as annoying as Jonathan's. The songs aren't as interesting as Richman's either. It's probably not fair to compare this album to one from the early 70's that he mostly didn't even play on, but I can't help it. You should check it out if you're really into the Modern Lover's family tree or a fan of Boston hard rock of the 70's - 90's. I didn't pay much for my cassette copy of it though."
2,Broke after a few uses,"I used these less than 20 times, took them apart to clean the last time and they would never go back together again- strange but true. Went into the trash, should've called customer service."
1,a letdown,"I looked forward to this book quite a bit after the The Healer and A Real Hero, but it was disappointing. The hunt for the deranged serial killer and all the minutiae of police procedures took up most of the book. It is pretty obvious who the villain is early on, and your initial guess will be right, but confusing irrelevant details seemed to drag the story down. Also,there was sex here, yes, but in my opinion very little romance. Interactions between Jesse and Delilah were mainly based on guilt, lust, and anger. The story featured few glimpses of their ""off-the-job"" lives. I liked the last couple of chapters and the epilogue, but found very little to enjoy before that. Are Superromances just going downhill?"
3,Tasha Tudor's A Time to Keep,"I was very, very disappointed in the lack of color in the newest addition. They are such washed out prints when compared to the original book. ..."
3,Get the older edition!!!,"This new edition is all washed out. What a huge disappointment. I actually reordered this book in the older edition, and gave this one away."
4,Civilian Internees from Guam in Japanese POW camp,"This is a riveting book. A must read for anyone with an interest in WWII, particularly in the Pacific. This story deserves to be widely publicized as it describes a POW situation hardly known or remembered.Well written by the survivor who experienced it first hand."
5,LAMENTATIONS OF A TORMENTED SOUL,"Norma McCorvey exposes, with hands-on experience, the horror that really is ""Freedom of Choice"". Her graphic depiction of the ""Parts Room"" in which dead unborn children are stacked, her assistance with late term abortions in which children are sliced up, ought to enough to soften the most hardened heart that is sympathetic industry. Norma talks of the lies of the abortionist, who tells the victim, mother that he removes only lifeless tissue. The same abortionist then tells his victim that the pregnancy that it is even further developed than thought, so that he can charge her a higher fee. This is the book for those who have not given much thought to the abortion issue, recognized it for what it is and done what they can to stop it. God Bless Norma McCorvey for her atonement"
5,A MUST for post-abortion workers!!!,"Being post-abortive myself, and counseling in this post-abortion ministry, I found this book to be very healing for me as well as hopeful. If the Lord can change Miss Norma's life, He can change mine and anyone's life!Miss Norma's honesty is so touching and her vulnerability is appreciated. Thank you, Norma, Emily, Ronda, and Flip for being obedient to the Lord in ""loving and caring for"" Miss Norma!Michelle M. Schroeder, Director, Raphael Ministries (Raphael@mcg.net), Minneapolis, MN, USA"
4,good purchase,"I am very pleased with my purchase. The movie is awesome and not mention hard to find normally, so i was extemely happy to see this two for one deal pop up when it did. The service from amazon was great....I never have problems with them. so overall...this was a great purchase."
5,Loved This Book!!!,I bought this book for my daughter (12 yrs old) and decided to go ahead and read it also. Not only did my daughter thoroughly enjoy the book - so did I! I'd recommend this book to any young adult reader!!
2,Eh.,"I was surprised by this novel, but not in a good way. As a 16 year old girl, I am the target audience, yet this book really fell flat for me. The characters as a whole are one dimensional with no particularly interesting or shocking backgrounds or personalities, even the main character. While the title of this book promises exciting adventures full of secrets and plot twists, the novel does not live up to it. The story has an alright beginning, but ultimately disappoints. More than anything, I was most bothered by the level of the reading. With the target audience being teenagers, one would assume that the novel would e highschool reading at least. At best, this novel was advanced elementary, basic middle school level reading. I thought this lack of challenge would be a nice relief from the difficult novels I read in school, but instead I found that it made reading boring, and the book as a whole, a waste of my time and money."
3,Great Story but Terrible Audio!,The story itself is rather original . The characters were interesting but Cammie was probably the most boring. The whole idea of a spy girl school was just great and the entire time I kept wishing I had gone to one.I listened to this on c.d and it was just awful. The reader sounded more like a 12 year old than a 16 year old character as depicted in the story. The lovey dovey scenes were even more ridiculous due to the voice. Had they got a better narrator I probably would've given this a higher rating but I just couldn't get past that to really get into the story. Sadly I also expected - all girl spy school kick butt theme would give us some strong role models and there just weren't any. Hope they get a better reader in the next audio book for this series.
5,"Great show, great soundtrack...","It is a shame that this musical was not more popular than it was. It is great. There are several hard to forget tunes that you will love. The songs ""Come Look at the Freaks"" and ""Tunnel of Love"" were my favorites. You should definitely buy this soundtrack if you are a fan of musicals. A+"
4,Odd concept...great show.,"I heard ""Who Will Love Me As I Am?"" on a talk show and I immediately fell in love with the combination of these two women's voices. Unfortunately, some of the songs are a little odd, but when it comes to ""Broadway"" songs, along with ""Who Will Love Me..."", ""I Will Never Leave You"" is powerful and beautiful. These two women better have another theatre vehicle soon! It would be such a waste if they don't work on another show together. The other cd's which they've released are on my list for my birthday. I know that I won't be disappointed. Too bad the show wasn't given the chance that it deserved."
4,Excellent,"I have not seen this show, but I am a huge fan of the music. The only thing I see wrong with it is the tuning when the sisters are singing together sometimes. Also, after the proposal. It doesn't hurt the effect of the score, but for a person with perfect pitch, it hurts the performance."
4,Nice Score ... Too Bad Show Didn't Last Longer,"Opening in the Fall of 1997, ""Side Show"" was roughly based on the lives of Daisy & Violet Hilton, Siamese twins who were Vaudeville performers during the Depression. Unfortunately, the production lasted only lasted about three months before closing.Alice Ripley & Emily Skinner (both nominated for Best Actress Tonys) are terrific as the twins and have beautiful voices. The talented supporting cast includes Ken Jennings (""Sweeney Todd""), Norm Lewis, Hugh Panaro, and Jeff McCarthy.Overall, the score is quite good and contains several memorable songs. Henry Krieger's beautiful music, however, is somewhat hindered by the score's uneven lyrics.Best tracks:Come Look At The FreaksThe Devil You KnowWho Will Love Me As I AmYou Should Be LovedI Will Never Leave YouHopefully, this production will surface again one day. Until then, this cd is a nice listen!"
3,New to Rai,"Like d_chesson before me, I bought this album because of ""The Fifth Element"" cab chase scene to the music of ""Alech Taadi"". I love the exotic (exotic to me) sound blended with modern instrumentation.I can't understand a word he is saying, but music is universal. I know what he means."
1,crapfest!,"Worst movie ever! I haven't seen that JLo/BenAffleck film that got such lousy reviews but I did see ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and it's got NOTHING on this piece. My wife and I left the theater it was so awful. Absolute embarrasment! I would truly hate to have anything this horrible on my resume or associated with me in any way."
5,Hay! Whatcha expect? Battlestar Galactica?,"I have thousands of movies and even bought a few hundred movies myself.I Love to watch 'em;-)I have all kinds. Cartoons, Slice and Dice, Westerns, Science Fiction of all sorts.I am not very good at writing reviews but I know what I like and I can spot a fumbling mess a mile away and this movie is not one.This movie will stand up to anything ""Cloud Nine"" has to offer if ya just put away your prejudices.Scripturely accurate? Hay folks, It's a MOVIE!"
3,both good and bad,"This book has well written study guides. The math review was particularly easy to understand and useful, especially for someone poor at math like myself. Unfortunately, the books merits are overshadowed by sloppy proofreading/editing. The answer keys are sometimes wrong (don't match the answers in the explanations), and there are many errors in the math review. To be fair, most are simple proofreading or numerical errors, the concepts are still well presented. However, these errors are annoying and diminish the book's effectiveness. E-mails sent to the editor went unanswered, despite the editor's claim to the contrary."
1,Absolutely hopeless,"The watch was supplied with a strap so small that I couldn't even do the clasp up - and I have smaller than average wrists.Completely absurd - the watch is therefore useless. The supplier has gone completely silent and the guarantee looks so complicated that it is now in the hands of my lawers.Oh and by the way Amazon are less than helpful - shortly after the purchase, the transaction dissapeared from my profile so I am unable to even contact the vendor.Seriously stay well clear."
4,Good watch,"Good looking watch. I expected a better refined product from this brand, the seconds hand is not well aligned and does not land in the exact seconds markings of the dial, hence this one only earns 4 stars."
3,I wish the band was better quality!,"I absolutely love the face of the watch and the finish is amazing. The color and the chrome is great yet not too flashy. Very elegant with the band and could be used both as a dress watch and casual everyday watch. The timer is great because it is accurate. Tachymeter is cool too since I just learned how to use it. Functions of the watch are definitely precise.The band is Horrible. Cheap plastic feeling and I really do not believe is real leather. If you are planning on buying this watch, I suggest you buy the stainless band or buy a new leather band for this because the one it comes with is stiff, cheap and flakes.Great watch but the band is sub-par."
1,Fraud!!,"This item is labelled as a ""Read along"" and says that it ""features a 24 page book and CD."" Well, there is NO BOOK!!"
4,"It is administrators guide, not implementors guide","This is good for beginners and administrators to get an understanding of the SSH. After reading it, you will know, how to set up and configure the SSH.However, it will not give you details of the SSH protocol for an implementor. I had to look into chapter 7 of ""VPNs Illustrated: Tunnels, VPNs, and IPsec by Jon C. Snader"" to get an overview of how the SSH protocol really works behind the doors. This chapter gave pictorial descriptions as opposed to textual descriptions in the SSH RFCs.In the next version, I would expect this book to contain a chapter giving implementation details of the SSH protocol."
1,Terrible. Hard to read. Disconnected.,"I've read other books by Ridley Pearson that I enjoyed. This book ,however was sophomoric writing.Poor research and a disconnected story line. I struggled to control my annoyance enough to complete the book."
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. If you like deep forest and Enya, you'll love this! I often play it when I want to relax and it helps my imagination soar."
5,Wade Bowen is so underrated,This young fellow has never produced a so-so collection of songs. He writes and sings from his heart about life's experiences and his melodies are unforgettable. He joins my group of terribly underrated singer-songwriters.
4,max and rubys halloween,If the kids like Max and Ruby they will love this episode too !! Children learn lessons and the stories are done in bright happy colors. My granddaughter loves it.
3,"Fits great, Rusts easily",Like other VW 2.0L CC owners this fit - without the clamp hardware - I just pushed them on with a light tap. Unfortunately they are already discolored with rust spots. They do not do well in the salted roads in NE Pennsylvania. I'll try to see if I can clean them up in the spring.
1,Poorly made,My mat split along the seam just as the previous review stated. These mats aren't made to last.
2,Great Idea - Lousy Execution,"Lasted perhaps a year before the seams burst, but it actually worked when it was intact. Please note that when you fill this thing with water it weighs a ton!"
3,Great but the Cool Bed III was better for me.,"No problems with mine at all. My pups love these!I also tried the Cool Bed II, but it's much more flimsy, and tends to bunch up. I ordered two more of this Canine Cooler, so I can keep two upstairs and two downstairs!I also used it at an agility trial and it helped keep them cool.I wish I'd bought one a few years ago!Years later.... I had to throw these away, they cracked and no longer held water. What is better is the Cool Bed III, those are holding up!"
2,Great idea...but...,"After reading the mixed reviews on this item, I bought it anyway because I figured it was really the only way to find out if I liked it or not. I was really excited to see how it would work for my hot dog of an English bully. It worked absolutely great for two and a half days- that is when my dog decided that the red plug-thing that holds in the water looked too much like a dog toy. Thank god I already have a dehumidifier to suck up the two gallons of water out of my carpet :) Those two days weren't long enough to know anything about the seams, like other reviewers complained about.Anybody on the fence about buying this, like I was: IF your dog NEVER chews on anything (haha) and will have ample supervision...this might work great for you! Otherwise, it is a total crap-shoot."
4,The book for medical man,"This book is not in detail as bibles of infectious diseases, but it is still worth reading. For an ID man, this book should be used as a supplementary one not a texbook. For its small size, disease pathogenesis can not be dicussed in depth and this is the major drawback of this book. For general internalists, this book is a good one that you can find numerous infectious informations. Update is also necessary for this book."
2,Not a big fan,"I have to say that I am not a big fan of the book.I purchased both Roman Candle and Dream Lovers (wrote by Dodd Darin).If I am not mistaking Roman Candle was originally published in 2004, and Dream Lovers was originally published in 1994.Let me tell you: in Roman Candle you are going to find A LOT OF THE SAME INFO THAT YOU WILL FIND READING DREAM LOVERS, at times it seems you are reading the same book (same words, same quotes even same punctuation).Sandra Dee is portrayed in a negative way, and I personally don't like that since I am a big fan of her.Personally I LOVED DREAM LOVERS, so if you are looking to buy a book about Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee, buy the one wrote by their son."
5,"Previously ordered two gallons, will be placing another order for at least two more...yes, I am that pleased.","This is a very good tasting olive oil and the price is outstanding.I was a little concerned about how it would ship but BMA wrapped each can in thick bubble wrap and they arrived in perfect shape with no dents, leaks or damage. In addition, I received a lightening fast order acknowledgement and with standard shipping received the order in just a few days.Excellent product, excellent price and excellent customer service. If that doesn't make for a five star rating, I don't know what would."
4,The Oil is ok but great as a Godfather movie collectible.,"There has been a lot of controversy in the news lately regarding olive oil and extra virgin most specifically. There are claims that most of what is labeled as ""extra virgin"" is either nothing of the sort or mixed with far inferior oils, most likely not even from olives. If you are a film lover you will find it ironic that organized crime has been blamed for this olive oil scam considering Vito Corleone's Genco Olive Oil Company from the Godfather movies. To be honest, I only purchased this as a collectible because I collect items that are, or look like movie props and this is as close you're going to get to that unless Paramount releases a Godfather licensed Genco Olive Oil, which isn't likely."
5,Great Oil. Great Price,"For those tired of paying nearly $1 an ounce for extra-virgin olive oil at your local market this is that rare item: a true bargain. This is a great olive oil, very light, none of the 10W-30 oiliness of some olive oils. Very subtle taste, just a hint of the taste of the ripe olives it comes from. You can use this on anything without the flavor coloring the taste. Great for coating things you're roasting or grilling with a moisture barrier to keep juices in, all with the mono-unsaturated benefits of the oil. The pop-out plastic spout is very good. And the can looks good in your kitchen, where it will impress your movie-buff friends. ""Genco"" was the name of the Godfather's olive oil import business. Well worth it. 128 ounces for your 25 bucks."
1,China Junk..,the box says made in Canada the part says made in China... I wish Amazon would list this info! its a name brand part and its still china crap..ugh
5,It's about time!,"For years US fans of this talented Chilean singer and songwriter had to go to great lengths to get hold of his music. Now his beautiful voice and music can find the audience he deserves here. This CD includes some of Alberto Plaza's best songs, from early classics like Yo Te Sequire and Aventurera to the magnificent Milagro de Abril and his latest single, No Me Quites La Ilusion. You'll be glad to have both this music and this singer in your collection. Let's hope it's the first of many Alberto Plaza CDs to be released in the US!"
3,Fun to build - could work better,"The directions were generally clear (until the end) and my 8 year old had fun putting it together with a little guidance and help tightening the screws (they were a bit hard). At first, it wouldn't walk, and we discovered that the arms were a problem. The picture showed the shoulder joints going back, but they really needed to face the front. Once we fixed it, the robot would walk fine, but the sound portion didn't work well. It will come on sporadically, not consistently.The best part was the building - it's a little boring to operate."
2,"Fun to Build, now what.","This item was fun for my daughter to build with her grandpa, but after it was built the fun was over. It doesn't do much except sit on the shelf and take up space. I told her to take it apart again and redo it. That might be fun once, but after that it will probably go to the Thrift Shop."
5,Great DVD SET,"I bought all the Dark Shadows Collections and I have enjoyed them a lot, Nice to watch when there is not anything else to watch."
1,Is this the advertized 'stick-on' thermometer?,The suggestion contained in a nutrition newsletter that the Chaney 03128 refrigerator thermometer be purchased is because it is supposed to have suction cups for mounting on side walls rather then clips for the shelf. The photo and write-up do not indicate that this product is the one described.Perhaps the manufacturer will fully explain.
3,i love this cd,"I really love this cd. Listerner's Supported still remains my favorite, but this cd is worth buying if you are a true DMB fan. I was a little disappointed that #41 and crash into me weren't on the cd, but i love everything else. Cortez the killer is worth the money of the entire cd."
1,live?,"a few nice spots, but mostly very boring. what took three CDs to playback could have been edited down to one half of a CD. too much ""never ending"" solo stuff. if it was returnable, it would be going right back! not worth the purchase price, and I really like dave mathews band."
4,"nice, but needs padding","Bought for babies room. Actual color is darker than swatch, but its pretty close.The carpet is well made and has sewn edges. It is thin though, so you will need padding."
5,Great little tripod for the money!,"I wanted a sturdier tripod than the dinky $10 one I have. I definitely wouldn't take my chances with my DSLR on that cheap thing. This one definitely fit the bill and seemed like the best fit for my needs and budget based on reviews. It's not too pricey and it seems very sturdy for what you get. There are some plastic parts, but I suppose that is expected for the price. For my purpose as a beginning photographer, it works great. I also like that it's black as opposed to gray, but that's my personal preference.I mainly use it for macro photography with my Canon Rebel XTI and Canon 100mm macro lens. I wouldn't be able to get tack-sharp pictures without it in low-light situations.I highly recommend this tripod for someone who is on a tight budget and wants something sturdier than some of the lower-cost tripods. It fits my needs nicely."
4,good info,What I read of the book there was a lot of good information. I just wish I could have read more before it was accidentely put it the bag to go to Goodwill. Now I'll have to buy another one.
4,re,Infornmative. I got it for my grand-daughter. She will really enjoy it I am sure. It will be agreat xmas gift.
2,Dissapointment,"It's hard to know what to say when you buy a CD on the chance that you will like it. Ernestine Anderson meant nothing to me; but, the CD looked interesting and the songs, listed, made it seem to be something worth listening to. Well, I was wrong (for me that is) I didn't care for her as a singer and the arrangements of the songs seemed ordinary. I can only speak for myself; someone else may like it, but for me, it's sitting on the shelf, probably never to be played again."
3,Not bad,"A great resource for someone who really needs to gain control of their dog. However, I was hoping that it would have more info on how to properly introduce the dog to the baby. It mainly just focused on basic training."
2,Caution: Flawed information,"Even in Amazon's excerpted text here online, you will find that this book presents quite a bit of misinformation as fact and profound insight.This book, as many do, bases advice on an incorrect understanding of canine rank and leadership. These popular miconceived assertions originate from a common but unrealistic view of wolf pack behavior. But those premised behaviors/interactions simply don't occur in reality, according to genuine wolf biologists, and according to genuine dog experts such as Suzanne Clothier.What's the harm? The harm is that many authors with such misconceptions recommend treatment and exercises that are harsh, unecessary, and unproductive. Worse, in some cases they can undermine trust and actually create fear.. And mistrust and fear are the primary reasons most dog bites occur.Take such instructions and falsely authoritative explanations with a grain of salt and a bit of caution.Jeff"
2,Almost plagarism,"This book seems to be a direct knockoff of Brian Kilcommons' book on the same subject. The only differences I really noted were splashy demonstration pictures & cute illustrations that supplemented the text. It was a waste of my money & don't recommend it if you are buying the Kilcommon's book on the same topic. It may be ok for someone w/no dog training experience, but to be honest, I'd purchase a training/obedience book from Kilcommons, along with Kilcommon's ""Childproofing your Dog"" book, if I were a sheer novice. (And sign up for some basic obedience classes in your area) I'm not convinced that Wombacher is a trainer from the contents of this book. And I have spent an extended amount of time in advanced obedience training w/my dog, as well as agility work and basic obedience w/2 other dogs."
3,This tape could be better,"Linda does a good job of teaching and the positions are all enjoyable. There are a few times when you aren't looking at the TV and she fails to cue you out of a position. I was hoping for a good routine I could do repeatedly. Unfortunately, she does so much talking that a full 1/3 of the time is wasted while she speaks. I solved this by making a copy and cutting out all idle time. But, it was a lot of trouble and I lost tape quality."
5,Great,I bought this for my toddler to play with. I wanted a basket ball hoop for him to learn to play basket ball and this was a hit. He loves it. It is durable and very affordable.
4,A first voice,"This book is a true ""first"". Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie has, for the first time, presented a page of history from medieval times that is seldom seen outside the confines of academia. Mr. Ladurie has sifted through the detailed records of the Catholic Church and brought to life the ordinary folk of the the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth. The book does not focus on the religious aspect of the Cathars but on the social life of people who have never before been spoken for. It is easy to study the lives of kings, princes and popes, but the ordinary citizens of this age have never had a voice before. The book is in French and translations into English are not easy to find but well worth the effort and expense."
5,"Great item, a must for filmakers","Bought this after wanting to usse the viewfinder exclusively on my video camera for wome outside work. I found it very easy to install, and it made the day long shoot a lot more comfortable than I was expecting."
4,Doug IS one of the BEST Ashtanga teachers!,"I have been lucky enough to practice with Doug in person and he's an amazing teacher. I think this dvd is great.. .maybe not for the very, very beginner to Ashtanga, but all-n-all great dvd. TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
1,Totally not worth the money!,If you're going to invest in music studio software then you should look at a more professional quality product. This it hard to understand and it won't do even a fraction of what I want it to do. Save your money on this and just go for the higher quality software from the beginning withough wasting money on this first.
3,great value,"This was a great value. It didn't leak and didn't get too cold. The downside - it poured SOOO slowly! And if you tipped it so it was vertical, it stopped completely. Bigger holes in the top would be good."
2,Jewish music,The music is not to my taste..and from the reviews I thought it would touch my soul in some way. I am sorry for this man's loss but the CD was a disappointment to me.
5,What a joy to read,"Evert Peters, a bachelor living in NYC, adopts the child Midge, raises her, then falls in love with her. Before he can make a total fool of himself, another man captures her love. Told plainly and without sentimentality, and with warm humor. A wonderful, old-fashioned book. Someone should get this back in print SOON."
3,Remember the days of tweaking autoexec to get game working?,"Well, this game seems to take you back to those days. Really, i can't remember the last time i had to (...) with video settings to get a game to work! My system meets minimum requirements, and worked fine for about 10 hours, now i can't get it to run at all. So I searched online forums and this seems like a fairly common problem.So unless you have fairly new hardware (and even that's no guarantee), prepare yourself for some pain. What a shame, cause the game seemed pretty fun. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for release such shoddy software, but then again, I guess that's what they do best..."
3,Good but not great,"I've read other people's reviews of the game and I've got to say that while the gameplay is indeed good, graphically the game looks like it should have come out a couple years ago. Yes, you can zoom in three levels but all of the units look like wind up toy soldiers when they move. The units in Age of Mythology and Empire Earth move much smoother. The flying units look terrible compared to the same units in Empire Earth. If it weren't for the Conquer the World mode of play I'd have to give this game 2 stars only. Do yourself a favor and buy the Empire Earth Gold Edition. It is cheaper and a better game for your average RTS player. Most people point out that Rise of Nations is better because each civ has unique units. Unique units for each civilization does not a better game make."
2,battery option does not work,"I need the battery option to work since where I live there are many power outtages. It does not work - we've tried 2 different, new batteries. Bummer."
3,Not worth the price,"I have been a Dean Martin fan for many, many years, having most of his CD's you can find. I wanted these CD's for the fact there are so many songs you can't usually find. For that fact I am glad I purchased. However, these CD's are not stereo, and the book is not well written. I think anyone who is a true Dean Martin fan will be offended by the book. I think it would be a better deal with just the CD's, and at a much lower price."
1,WARNING!!! - Useless - older version!,WARNING! Amazon should put this label on all of its out of date manuals. This book has a 2005 copyright and is written for a version of Adobe Premiere elements that has been revised at least 4 times since publication. It is useless for the current Premiere Elements 7.0. I was fooled -- don't you be too.
2,Just the same,"I thought this book would be different from the manual that came with the software, but it was exactly the same. A disappointment."
3,My mistake too.....,"Adobe Premiere Elements Classroom in a BookNeither of these books are for Premiere Elements 4.0. I was looking to buy one for Premiere Elements version 4. BUT in looking I found the combined book that has Photoshop and Elements. I use Photoshop CS3 and certainly did not need a combination book. In the list with the combination book, I saw the Adobe Premiere Elements book, but was unaware that the book did not fit version 4. I believe that the Amazon posting should be clear. The software for 3.0 is clearly marked as OLDER VERSION. It is a bad feeling to get stuck with a book that is useless. 4/4/08"
4,"I don't cheat, but my cousin does","He came over this afternoon with it, while I don't cheat in my games, he just bought it so he brought it with him, well I bought my ps2 in 2000 when it just came out, and it works like a charm, I don't know what else other people are complaining about but it works, dynasty warriors 4 was the game that it was tested on."
2,Not as good as game shark,"As previous owner of a GameShark for PS2 (it was stolen after some idiots broke into my apartment), I decided to try something new... I purchased this based on reviews of it having an ""intuitive interface"" and ""better than GameShark"". After playing with it for a bit, I know that those reviews can't be further from the truth.I pride myself in being a somewhat accomplished Techno-phile, but to call this interface ""intuitive"" is the same as expecting someone who has never worked a computer to be able to write HTML code.As for better than GameShark?...No way... GameShark comes pre-loaded with more games and better codes. What's the point of cheating the game if you don't have an invincible cheat or infinite money? Those have to be most important cheat codes to just about any game! And they aren't found in all the games on the disk or even on the CodeJunkies site... You can request codes on the site, though... We'll see how that works out..."
1,"Don't buy, it will corrupt your files, and lose saves!!!","I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection, or using a USB flash drive. I have not been able to get either to work correctly. After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card. It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2. I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises. Their customer support is lousy, with a response that merely said...sorry. Well thanks a lot to them...just lost hours of game saves!!!"
3,"Flawed, but adequate....","BAD:The memory card manager corrupted my memory card and destroyed saves. It takes a long time for the disk to load, and like most cheat devices many codes don't work and it also causes freezing quite often. This device uses a different type of code than any other device so your stuck with what the manufacturer come up with...which isn't that great.GOOD:The most usefull part to me is that it lets you play different region DVDs on the PS2. Also, the ability to download codes and gamesaves is pretty cool.Over all this is a decent buy, but I would probably be happier with a Codebreaker or the newer USB AR MAX."
3,Maxxed out...,"Action Replay MAX vs. Codebreaker PS2Who will win?Codebreaker better features:Loads fasterMore games to choose fromMore codes to choose fromA bit cheaperYou only need a PS2 Memory CardCodebreaker's worst features:No powersavesDifficult to useOverall, it's a tie. But they're both worthwhile devices to use."
1,"Sony PS2-Model No#SCPH-50001,beware!","If you have a new 'Playstation 2',model number# SCPH-50001,you will not be able to play this disc period! To look up compatibility for other 'Itec' products,Intec web site:(codejunkies.com),the model number for your 'Playstation 2' is on the back,very simple,take a look,will save you some money and heartache."
3,I got what I paid for,"This item wasn't expensive, so the quality wasn't that great. If you're only going to use it every once in a while it'll work for ya.If you need a solid, well built roll-tape, pay the extra money and get the brand name, not the cheap knock off. The telescoping doesn't lock in place on the narrow (bottom) portion so I'm not sure why it even collapses....or maybe the one I ordered is broken?Eh, it was cheap and I don't feel like returning it."
5,I WAS THERE!,As typical with Allan Eckert the details and writing style put me there. A wonderful book that should be read if this subject matter interests you.
1,Disappointing,"I saw the movie and loved it and the way the music was woven throughout. As a result, I couldn't wait for the soundtrack. What a disappointment! I was looking for the song Brian was playing in his jeep while on the way to Kenya's house and the song played during their wedding scene--NEITHER is on the soundtrack.I loved, loved, loved ""Seconds of Pleasure"" and since the other songs weren't on the soundtrack--I just bought Van Hunt's album and surprise--what a great artist he is! I just want to know who the artists are for the two songs that I wanted but are not included. Hats off to Wendy and Lisa--but their songs were best DURING the movie--not for the cd."
2,Disappointing...,"Disappointing.... Unless all you want to see is pretty fall leaf colors. Lots and lots of pretty fall leaf colors that could have been photographed at any of dozens of other places in the northeast in September ...When I decided to purchase this DVD, I had expected to feel that I had visited Acadia National Park and after viewing , I certainly did not. There were a couple of minutes of waves washing up on a couple of beaches, a view from Cadillac Mt and some time driving along the loop road. I was equally unimpressed with the extensive views of wildlife. 1 chipmunk, 1 yellow dog, 3 seagulls, 1 duckTwo stars for the pretty leaves - None for conveying information about the park."
3,DAUGHTER DEAREST.......,"Francoise Sagan's works have never quite been realized on film [""That Certain Smile"", ""GoodBye Again""].This version starring Jean Seberg, pairing David Niven and Deborah Kerr [great team] as the hapless loves sabotaged by the daughter's love, with the various other inhabitants of the summer villa has quite a unique black and white prelude/conclusion and title sequence. Juliette Greco [icon!] sings demurely!Slightly soap-operaish, it holds attention, and is rather pretty - that French Postcard look.You'll need a kleenex or two for this one though......"
1,Will not ship,"I really wanted this item, but they refused to ship outside the USA. My child will now have to wear another product to make his mother happy."
4,Being Human: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology,"The author has presented a dearth of scholarly investigation into our world of diverse cultures in an exceptionally rational and objective perspective. The materials contained therein are relevant, helpful, and easy to understand."
3,"Not awesome, but good","This isn't the best Overkill album by a long shot. Killbox 13 might tie it. Bloodletting is way better. Anyway, fans will probably like it. I wouldn't say it's a let-down. The last song, Old School, is almost pure punk anthem and a nice change of pace. The song about gambling is stupid. 4 or 5 good rockers on here. I'd like to see a little more speed and a little less heavy. Still and all, if you like most of their later work(Killing King to the present) you'll probably dig it."
2,"Ok, glad I didn't spend more","I bought this book thinking it would help with my frequent hosting of large crowds, but it didn't help at all. It might help IF I needed obscure, expensive ingredients and gourmet friends. I needed something way more practical."
5,Simply the best guide to providing elegant and memorable dinner parties.,"I am a long time fan of this book--it was given to me as a gift when it was first published in 1988. Not only are the recipes wonderful--the ""training"" Susan Wyler gives in the art of preparation and delivery of simple yet elegant dinners is invaluable. I was thrilled to see this reintroduction of the book, and immediately bought a copy for each of my daughters who are now grown with homes of their own! I can't say enough about how grateful I am that this book has graced my kitchen."
5,Great Documentary - Real House Music,"Not only is this a great film about House Music (something I love very much) but it's a great documentary film as well. All of the interviews are laid back, and very interesting. The background music is PERFECT. If I could say one bad thing about this film is that it's a little grainy at times, but the sound and stories make up for it."
4,Potato smashing 101,"Believe it or not I could not find this type of conventional masher anywhere in my community so I was glad to see I could get it through Amazon. My only complain is the flimsly feel of it but hey, it gets the job done and probably will last me a long time."
4,This set was missing a piece,"Very cute set, however our set was missing one of the vegetables. I have contacted the company to see about a replacement."
5,Great Event,Great DVD. I watched this event live on pay per view but missed some of the fights. One of the best MMA cards ever. Only disappointment was the walk out music still being overdubbed as is usual for the DVD.
3,LOT OF SCRATCHES,The dvd has a lot of scratches and the video quality is poor in the preveiws. Thank goodness the actual movie seems to be ok.
2,Does not work,I replaced a feeder that after 10 years stopped working. Food did not flow out anymore. This has not worked once since i got it. Food gets stuck and i have to shake itfor food to come out.
2,Rec'd different item from picture & food doesn't drop,"I ordered this expecting the item in the picture- the blue one. I received a tan one ( I actually ordered two of them) but didn't think much of it until I started using them. ( I assumed it was just a color difference & I didn't check it until today. The one pictured has a larger opening for the food to drop out. I actually took a hacksaw to one of mine yesterday & made the opening about 1/2"" bigger but it didn't help.Shaking the thing doesn't help with the smaller or modified opening; I have to stick my fingers in to get food out! I've contacted the seller (Two 2 Tango) & hope they will replace these with the blue one... and I hope that one works better."
4,Gets the job done,"I absolutely love this pet food dispenser. It's simple to refill and clean and the design and color is simple enough that it fits into any room and with any decorating style. They're also pretty durable as I actually had one before when my first cat was still living, and I was understandably upset when it went missing during my last move. The only problem that I have with it - which doesn't happen all the time, mind you - is that sometimes dry cat food gets stuck coming out of the dispensing hole, but a quick tap or two on its lid or its side usually shakes down the food and gets rid of the blockade."
4,Doesn't dispense food well,I'll probably be going back to my other feeder because this one doesn't dispense food well. It gets stuck and I have to shake it to release the food.
4,Girl's Christening to Wedding Bracelet,I bought this for my granddaughter for her baptism. It came very quickly and in good condition. I am hoping she will get to wear this for all of her sacraments throughout the years.
2,Fear Factory: Archetype,"Ok first off its great that they got back together.But did it make a dent in the ""metal scene""?well, not really...Fear Factory is a hardworking band, right? of courseFear Factory is a very heavy band, right? of courseThough it sounds like any other routine metal band, right? of course...No change in sound what so ever...Slipknot, for example, their music has changed metal completely, the masks, the lyrics, the instruments... they are like no other band... unless you talk about the masks, MushroomHead and Mr. Bungle have done that, but Slipknot thought of the idea by themselves...the titanium custom percussions that slipknot use sound so different from anyother band, you could pick out the drums of slipknot from all others... especially using the metal bat to hit a ""beer keg"" that sounds amazing... [download SLipknot: Duality]Not being biased, just making a point using an example...Though Fear Factory is a good band, its not a band that stands out from alot of other bands..."
3,Fearing less of a factory,"I usually have to fight my way through not staying bored with limited, crunch-heavy sessions like these, so it is nice to at least the simple approach maintain at least slight interest (if eventually becoming redundant) through incisive refinement to produce something slightly greater than an oiled machine."
2,Disappointing,"The guitar riffs are good and the vocals stink. They try to mixrock with heavy metal, rap and punk. IT DOESNT SOUND GOOD.There are some good moments from time to time on this cd, but overall the quality of the songs are not good."
3,Typical FF,"OKay, I have only listened to this CD twice, and it's good....but let's get real...it's FF. It sounds like Demanufacture...which sounds like Obsolete....which sounds like Digimortal. The stuccato riffs are everywhere, and pretty soon, you just get tired of them, no? I used to hate Obso and Digi, but I actually listen to them more than all the others, just because the sound is crafty and has more groove. So buy it if you like old FF, and can't get enough of it...but don't expect anything new. Oh yeah, Soul of a New Machine is their best CD by far, and is serious death metal with a creative edge."
1,where is dino cazares?,i lost my time and my money for hear the new bass and christian on the guitar sound like system of a down
3,what happend???,The majority of these songs are good but it sounds the same as some of their other albums and it doesn't sound like their sound has matured much. The problem with some of these songs are the choruses because they slow down the song. Like on act of god it starts out good with him yelling out the lyrics then he starts to sing the chorus then it goes fast again with him yelling again. Don't get me wrong I like how he sings out the choruses on some of the songs but sometimes it doesn't go with the song and it sounds a bit repetitive. The best song on this album would have to be slave labor.
3,D.A.M.M. -- rate it? i havent even listened to it !,is this the digipack version (with the bonus DVD) or not? ...anyone knows?
1,los latinos banneen este item,"si, vi un programa especial en canal 5 de linkin park y note que grababan el disco por partes es decir primero la bateria luego la guitarra etc. es lo que deberian hacer para que charles no le vea la cara a dino"
1,fear factory sucks,fear factory sucks... they suck live.. they suck on cd...seriously people at their shows just stand there and wait for them to finish..they suck
5,Great Battery,This is a great low costing backup battery that works as good as the original battery....Works Great in my Samsung NV3...
3,Good for an introduction to Tchaikovsky,"This CD was the first that really got me interested in listening to Tchaikovsky. I remember listening to Romeo and Juliet over and over, loving the sad soulful melodies in Marche slave, awakening to the proud trumpeting in Capriccio italien, and being stimulated by the exciting motives of 1812 overture. I listened to it over and over until I was sick of it, then I moved on and listened to different recordings of this and other Tchaikovsky works.After hearing some of Antal Dorati's renditions of 1812 and the others, I listened to this album again and found it stale and stagnant, not as lively or full of passion as Dorati's.It is a good buy for the price, but I suggest it be only a starting place for your Classical and/or Tchaikovsky collection. After you are amazed by being initially exposed to Tchaikovsky, listen to Dorati and be amazed all over again.~C~"
4,Good Phone,"This is a good phone. Caller ID works great. So does voicemail indicator. Easy to set-up. The ringer is not very loud, and you have to include a 1 with your long distance numbers in your phone book because it does not automatically dial it. Because of that, I give it 4 stars."
4,Pretty darn good,I've never been a serious gamer but after giving in and purchasing the Xbox system (solely for the critically acclaimed and rockin' Halo series) in late 04 I started seeing the reasons for all the hype. Halo is by far the pinnacle game in my opinion and the music makes for a great listen. Combining instruments and electronic noises Halo is given a future-sounding soundtrack that suits the game perfectly. This is a must for any fan of Halo.
1,Much better books out there,"This is a poor, and opportunistic, rehash of the Law of Attraction.The authors have added their cutesy little variations, like the 79 cent notebook and all that jazz, to make it different.I was turned off because they have used the book to sell very expensive seminars on their website.Skip this book. This is simply a get-rich-quick scheme by the authors.I definitely recommend Write It Down, Make It Happen, as another reviewer did."
3,Tithing--what it really means,"Emmett Fox talks about tithing as giving a tenth of your joy, happiness, positive emotions, etc. to God. He suggests giving what you can, when you feel moved to do so. That sounds like a lot better way to view tithing, to me. God doesn't need your money--and this book even says not to ask the Universe for money.I think some of this is a good exercise, but there are better sources for the same information, but everyone learns in different ways. I think Neville Goddard is better, in terms of explaining the deeper aspects of the Law of Attraction. Emmett Fox is more appealing to me. But, as a starter on this type of work, this book is OK."
5,This book will change your life...,"You don't really even have to believe any of it. If you follow their steps, you will get everything you want! I got the ebook just a few short weeks ago and my family and I are already wealthier and on our way to the wealth we've always dreamed of! Many things I asked for through the process have already found their ways to me.You MUST get this book!"
2,Incomplete definitions,This book has many terms but incomplete definitions. Looks like a quick and easy once over.
1,Testimony to self-absorbtion.,"Taylor has made a name for herself in the Episcopal Church as a speaker, and I read this book as an entree into her work. What I found was a woman so wrapped up in herself that her ""vocation"" was at best a soliloquy from the very start rather than the dialogue implicit in a call. The present Episcopal Church is in theological disarray, and her very fuzzy explication of even her own position, let alone that of the church she claimed to represent, is a good example of why. I read this book to the very end, hoping that there might be a substantial surprise in the last chapter, but it remained a picture of a woman looking at only herself in her mirror and empty to the last."
5,Leaving Church,"Like all of her books, Barbara Brown Taylor has used the English language in a manner that allows us into her mind and heart. Her beautiful descriptions of her environment and her spiritual journey create mental images that enrich the reader. I highly recommend this book."
2,Pretty Book.....,"There's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book. Unfortunately, I think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen. While there are beautiful pictures (lots of Nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me. I bought and loved ""How to be a Domestic Goddess"", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same. I have to say I was dissapointed. I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book. (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.) While there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a ""pretty to look at"" picture book than a hard core recipe resource."
2,Not up to her usual standards,"I love Nigella.I love her books.I love her style, and her heart.She writes like an angel.She's brave and she's good.Her recipes work!Of course, I bought this book. And there is plenty that is good in it. But I think it's important to at least be able to say that there are some things which are not so good - specifically, the layout is gratingly difficult to follow, there are not enough pictures ... and there's a really noticeable amount of recycling from her other books. (She identifies each repeat - so my issue isn't with Nigella's integrity. It's just that I'd rather have a somewhat smaller book with all new material.)If you're buying your first Nigella book or looking for one to give as a gift, I would recommend her classic ""Baking & The Art Of Comfort Cooking,"" - not ""Feast."""
4,Nice hitch cover,"I really like the flip-flops hitch cover. I'm a flip-flop wearing girl, so it fits me perfectly. It is very sturdy, heavy duty & looks great on my Jeep.. I look forward to having it on my Jeep for many years to come..."
5,Lulu Doll,"This doll is so cute, my daughter has lots of fun with this doll; it's completely posable; my daughter is not ready for barbies yet and this doll is just perfect for her."
1,A Fiction Book at Best,"This book is awful. It comes across as a figment of Graham Masterton's imagination. This seems to be his fantasy of sex. Much of this book is full of just what you would read in a Hustler mag. There is a heavy overtone of lesbianism yet the book cover gives the impression of heterosexuality. His last chapter is filled with lesbian/incest (mother, daughter, and one guy) sex ... DISGUSTING! These related accounts of others lives are alleged true ... yeah, right. As I said, these stories seem to be a figment of his wild sex craved fantasies. It is done in very poor taste. Awful, absolutely awful. Don't buy this book."
3,Not great choices,"I think this is an average work but I am particularly interested in his recommended listening list. It's the same tired-old SQ repertoire that gets played on the concert circuit. I'm surprised that he didn't include Bartok as he and Shostakovich are the only well-known 20th century composers. In terms of the 20th century works I can't stand noisy Schafer but like Riley especially 'Salome Dances For Peace'. But I would have like to seen an expansive list, containing the range of beautifully written SQs of 20C. For instance,Hilding Rosenberg, Hindemith, Krenek, David Diamond, Darius Milhaud, Vagn Holmboe, RobertCasadesus. I could go on and that is the problem. It seems that the author is only familiar with the 'Top 20' of the repertoire and has never explored it in any detail."
4,A Gateway to Japanese Culture,"Though the story itself lacks in plot, the reader comes away with an understanding of the various relationships in Japanese culture. The first two parts serve as a lengthy introduction to the beautifully crafted third part. Consider this a wonderful novel for an introduction to Japanese literature."
4,Perfect for intended use,Purchased this product for post-vasectomy support. Boyfriend reported it worked as intended and he was able to wear it over normal briefs for extra support.
1,Pure Garbage,I needed a jock strap and purchased Bike because that's the brand we would use in high school. Right out of the box there was string hanging off it. I thought this was not a big issue but as time ticks away the thing is unraveling. I haven't even washed it yet. I think it wouldn't even make a good grease rag because there's hardly enough material. I would rate this if there were negative stars because one isn't low enough.
1,This is NOT a 2-Pack,"This is only 1 jockstrap. The description says 2-Pack and that is not the case. Please be aware if you order this you are only getting 1. Very disappointed in this. While the jock itself is comfortable and durable, I was turned off by the inaccurate description."
1,Fell apart after 3 washings,They use to be made great...not anymore. Already had to toss 2 pairs after a few washings. Threads came out and tearing at stitched lines.
1,Bike Jock Strap,"If your looking for support don't purchase Bike Performance, all show no go. Trust me i had surgery, no support works ok with a cup and you don't have to hand wash, that's the only reason i didn't return them."
5,"Joe is Joe, there is no equal !!!!!",Joe has a very sick sense of humour and those with the same will enjoy this DVD almost as much as his website. I've watched his site and cartoons grow over the years and am rarely disppointed.Much more on his website. Gotta check it out !!!!
5,The 'Professional Writer' of Writers,"In 1972, while working at a 'Fortune 10' company, I attended a writing course that featured Albert Joseph's 'Put It In Wrting' book. With a new perspective on writing, my career soured largely due to my improved writing abilities.Having been incorporated now for over fifteen years and working as a Consultant to 'Fortune 50' companies around the globe, my major strength and marketable talent is 'WRITING' for a Senior Management audience.Albert Joseph's new edition of his popular book is a 'Must Have' for any Professional or Non-Professional that is serious about writing. What a fantastic bargain for $12.00!"
1,Sorry excuse for a book,Look elsewhere if you want to program for the PalmOS with Java. This book mainly talks about the history of Java and why you may not want to use J2ME. I'm sending my copy back for a refund.
5,2007 Law Student,This is an excellent textbook on Wills and Trusts. I received the book ontime in mint condition. Case Closed.
3,B B B B Title The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend,"Preston Sturges 1949 feel good movie. If you are reminiscent of the forties, you will enjoy watching this bygone era.It is well paced, glamorous and it bit racists with regard to Betty Grable's American Indian side kick. Its genre is fantasy and glamour based with all the characters acting in stereotyped roles to embellish the humor so common in the 30s and 40s."
5,A wonderful pocket guide for Nahuatl,I am actually currently a student of Prof. Herrera and I can tell you that this man is better versed in the Nahuatl language than anyone you know. This pocket guide is a great reference guide and I recommend it to anyone looking to explore Mesoamerican culture and tradition.
3,Captivating chemistry,"3 1/2Of course with these players the understated never seems to factor into any equation, but for an intimate setting of epic, mostly acoustic renditions and originals, this duo remains compulsively listenable."
4,Good Product,"This hose mender is heavy and strong. I'd like to give it 5 stars, but I could not get all the screws out. Apparently an electrochemical reaction occurred between dissimilar metals and froze the screws. Using all my strength I was able to get all but one out. In order to use the connector, the head of the remaining screw will need to be drilled off and a replacement screw found."
3,good overall guide -- needs help!,"If you have read the other review then I will echo it. The book is very narrow with details. There are no maps and the pictures that could act as maps are very dark are not helpful. the book gives you one way to do something but there are many better ways. It tells you exactly what you need to do and that is it, you can run around alot and find many more items and events. It could give you better advice like don't collect money it isn't a big issue, I had over 60,000 when the game ended! The first game had many side quests whereas this one has only 2! The caracter view is very limited and is very hard to see what is going on at times. The first game had a much better hint guide, but then again it was written by serria not prima!"
1,"A whiny fantasy, not a memoir","I happen to know something of Marcia Aldrich's real life family. She was the youngest of three sisters, there was no fourth sister who drowned. At 47, Ms. Aldrich is more a child of the sixties than the fifties. And she was born in a hospital, not an alley.Even if she is trying to use these inventions as emotional symbolism, they provide no model for the empowerment of women.Since the book is also badly written, I agree with the first reviewer who said, 'poor baby.' I wonder if African or Latino women would think being raised in a clean, upper-middle class household would be so burdensome; pink bedroom, country club, private schooling and all."
1,Lost of money ...,"SO TINY, FRAGILES; IMPOSSIBLE / EXTREMELY HARD TO TWISTED WITHOUT BROKEN. MUCH LESS OF WHAT EXPECTED. WILL NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL."
1,Very bad quality,The globe's graphics are very bad... country borders are all drawn badly and essentially are wrong.They should mention that its basically a rudimentary product or send a proper one as replacement.
1,Not worth the money,"We bought this gate to go across an entryway. The template does NOT line up correctly and the gate was way off when we put it up. When my husband started to take it down all the screws stripped and broke off into the wall. We attempted to install this three times (once without the template) and now I have molding full of holes and broken screws.Also, when we did get it up it was crooked and we couldn't get it to really line up correctly. When we tried to ""unlock"" it, the whole mechanism came off the wall.The gate went back to the store. I bought a SuperGate V. It isn't as pretty, but it was installed in minutes and it functions perfectly. And it was only half the price!"
4,I'd Recommend it!,"This gate didn't actually have any reviews when I bought it, so I hesitated. But, I have been very pleased. Pros- it actually doesn't look bad and seems very sturdy. It is fairly easy to open and can be done with one hand. It is complicated enough that I don't think our one year old will be able to get though. The con would be that my husband did not feel it was the easiest to install even though the directions were clear. But, this may be because we did not have studs in the walls that were equal on each side. Overall, I think if you are looking for a wide gate this is a great option."
5,"Clear, crisp Trout!","I bought this recording because the disc includes Schubert's song 'The Trout' along with the quintet. This recording of the Trout Quintet is perfectly able to stand its own two fins -- even without the song this disc is worth buying. I found it to be completely enjoyable. The balance between piano and strings is admirable: good engineering, Sony Classical!"
3,"Ordered the one color, black - got BLUE !","I ordered the Zip sleeve, listed as only one color (black). I have used the Zip sleeve before, great for combining power cord / tv cable, although the only drawback is that they consistantly fade and deteriorate in just 2 boating seasons. Much to my surprise when the new zip sleeve arrived it was BLUE (#Zip-02), now actually I think the blue might have a better chance of making it beyond 2 boating seasons, so since I use 2 zip sleeves on my power cord I went back not to return the blue one but to order another. Surprise again, only black is listed. I have contacted Amazon and they are working on what happened and how I can get another blue one because it is STILL listed in only one color - BLACK."
5,Great reading,"I loved all three stories. However, I loved Winter Heart the best as it was a continuation of Cheryl Reavis story dealing with three women (they called themselves the Three Musketeers when they were little) living in Salisbury, NC, after the Civil War.The Winter Heart deals with the heart broken Eleanor (who lost her fiance in the Civil War) getting on with her life and finding love again.BRAVO!!!! Ms. Reavis for such a great story!!Bring on more stories about Salisbury this time write about Dr. Reid who was supposed to be staying in Salisbury, NC while reconstruction was going, write about Pike the Sergeant Major who was born to manage officers (marry him off to Valentina, he is the only one I think who can manage her and her Mamma) and don't forget heartbroken Elizabeth who has lost her son...she needs a happy ending also."
4,3.5 stars,This works ok but don't know what will happen for someone with big feet.Works the waiste and is easy to use.
2,Twister Board,"I wish someone could come up with a twist board the was bigger. This i think is a small 10"" board. I believe alot of people would order it more if it were a 16-16.5"" Board. The bumps on the top shouldn't be there. Should be smooth non stick on surface, and really the average person should have a wider board. I really want to return it. I think for kids this size may be fine, but for a teenager or adult its way too small. Please let me know if anyone out there knows where i can find a 16-16.5"" Board. I'd order it even if there were ridges. I would love to find this item. If its smooth i would be extremely happy."
3,Prefers one side,"This product was great the first month I owned it, but with continued use I saw that without even my trying to go in one direction, it would move on it's own. Much like how gravity has a tendency to pull your limbs and body in one direction...it felt like I all of a sudden was a lot heavier on my left side. Well, I can't say I really got much of an effective workout after I discovered I was working harder to not spin in a one directional circle, pretty much counter-productive. I guess I got what I paid for. Although since I had ordered two, I've modified my workout to incorporate the both which actually does work. I don't spin. Not a complete waste of money."
2,wouldn't buy it again,"The twist board is extremely tiny, though i guess for the price its not logical to expect something very large. It does work although i just got it a week ago and can now hear random part rolling around inside of it. It seems to be relatively poor quality, but its not like i expected anything else for the cost. You definitely get what you pay for."
1,scratched before first use ...,It's Junk ... returned asap to get one made from stainless steel... don't make my mistake-buy something made of stainless steel right away.
5,An essential I would recommend to ANYONE,"In Search of the Source is vital for anyone who values TRUTH and its origins or roots. The book highlights how SOURCES were important to this small people group and how they see answers to their own questions and problems as they aid a missionary in translating the bible into their own language.Wycliffe Bible Translators, by the way, performs a major work of PRESERVING languages which have no written form by partnering with members of the language groups to design an alphabet and to translate scripture into the native tongue.It is always a major undertaking that requires humility and patience, as the villagers become the translator-missionary's elders in the project. It is very much the product of the people, themselves, only aided by the Wycliffe missionary.Note, too, that each member of Wycliffe is self-funded. It is a faith-based mission."
2,Good - but not very challenging,"The quality and price are great, but the level of difficulty is too easy for what I was looking for. It is 360, but the board stands on its own because the bottom is only slightly rounded. I had to lean to make it require balancing rather than it requiring constant balancing just to stand. Nothing wrong, just not what I thought it would be. Maybe a balance rating would help. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being a disk over a ball), balance needed here is about a 2 -- probably for safety, but not very challenging."
4,Strategic Management: Concepts & Cases,"It is a helpfull book, especially for anyone who deal with the strategy formulation. This book provide some valuable tools for analyzing the organization's environment, both external and internal, which is something special with this book that make it different with the other."
2,Didn't last very long,"Four years. That's what I got from this watch. I wanted something better than a Timex. Something that would really last. I guess the Timex would have been better. This watch just stops, and then restarts on it's own. Lost 2 hrs 5 minutes today. Replaced watch battery also and it made no difference. The crystal seems a bit scratch prone too. Not sure it's worth the cost of repair with crystal replacement. I'm disappointed. I thought it would last longer than this without having to be serviced."
4,Space Buddy!,"This was a stocking stuffer for our son-- who has an ongoing fascination with all aspects of outer space. Great for him, he played ""space"" (most of the astronaut figurines are not meant for play time, at least by younger kids), and his younger sister is also enjoying playing with it-- without us having to worry about her damaging the toy or herself!This would be great as a party decoration (buy a couple!)."
3,Pretty but...,"I gave this pepper mill only a 3 star rating because the description indicated that the gears would last a lifetime because this ""grinder"" would crush the peppercorns instead of grinding them. While this may be true and turning the handle is easy the dispensing of pepper is very slow . Frustrating if you are cooking...."
4,Rock Patriot in rare form,"Although this offering to the public will Pale by comparison to his New Cd ""for The People"", Mark did give a rocking performance worthy of the modest price.The acoustic version of ""Closer to home"" alone making the CD a classic.Good Farner Fan collectable."
3,Just okay,It gets the job done but not for heavy duty jobs that require some muscle to remove retainer rings ect..
5,The best,"Much better quality than ""box store"" items. We have a number of different brands and this is absolutely the best. Even the washer and the rubber grips are of a better quality. Good price. Excellent quality. Fast shipping. As advertised. Worked as expected. Also, this style has no automatic shutoff valve which we prefer and makes it easier to drain hoses."
3,Rare find,"It's amazing how hard it is for me as a contemporary Jewish fiction writer to find contemporary Jewish short fiction that speaks to the current generation of Jews. This is a sad book in many ways. Many of the stories leave me with a feeling of loss. So many Jews feeling so disconnected. The high quality of the fiction helps explore those feelings of Lost Tribeness from so many angles. Really an important read, wherever you stand in the Jewish world."
4,Annunaki Heritage,"I am amazed that with our short lifespans that we can even function! Perhaps, we as a race cannot, look at current world conditions. The book makes clear that the race is young,we better grow up or the ""gods"" will end their experiment with self goverment. the implications are enormous,will they further improve the race,again ?"
4,hard and humorous,"I began using buns of steel about a year and a half ago, encouraged by my then roomate who was a B.O.S finatic. At first it was so hard and I felt like I was extremely out of shape. But, within months my roomate and I added 5lb. leg weights and used them through out the whole video. We both had a great time with it and found it hilarious to name all the characters (the russian dancer, the 70's clown, and Chuck Norris). I have moved out and live 3000 miles away. So, after trying to stay steady with a gym membership, I am ordering my very own copy of B.O.S"
4,old faithful,"I've owned this video since 1990, and I always come back to it. Yes, it is dated. But it's worth it. There's a reason it's still around!"
3,Press it out and stretch it back,"The Good: Wailing 80s electric guitar. Instructor compliments your buns. The first few times I was laughing pretty hard. You don't sweat a lot. It is available on DVD. I bought it from Amazon, because it feels more secure, I know I could of saved money, by buying from another website, I just don't care. Some of the exercises I was able to drink water as I did them, others it felt too painful to go on.The Bad: Wailing 80s electric guitar. This is more of warm-up video, you'll need to do a lot more to be in shape, unless you wish to look like a pretzel."
4,Ned Flanders likes them buns,This is a good workout tape and definitely helps improve your butt and theighs. But you have to get over the annoynces of the cheesy 80s music and Greg Smithey (aka Ned Flanders).
2,How's this movie get a 4-1/2 stars...,"This movie looked good until the very graphic battle scene. The battle doesn't make sense, one of them said 13 against 130. If you do the math, each of the 13 assassins only need to kill off 10, but they kept killing the soldiers, probably around 20 each, and there are still more soldiers showing up. Still weirder at the end, one of assassins was killed but then he came back to life running around like it was nothing..."
4,Good movie,Slow start but good movie overall. The visuals were done very well. I also like the fight scene that lasts almost an hour!
4,13 Assassins,The Blue Ray edition of 13 Assassins was received promptly and in great condition. I enjoyed watching the movie. It is a good movie but not as good as some older samurai productions.
5,13 Assassins,"Best Samurai movie I have ever seen. I have been a fan of the old black & white Japanese movies since I was a kid; but I never could understand why the good guys had to die, or why everyone had to dye in the end. This movie puts the reasoning behind the story out there in a way that I can understand. It has culture, a love-story, comedy, drama, tragedy, courage, sacrifice, loyalty, honor and more action than I have ever seen. Japanese movies are famous for their gore and this one does not disappoint. If you can't stand blood and guts, truely evil bad guys, and mutilation, then do not watch this movie. I liked this movie because of its reality. There is no flying through the sky or jumping over lakes or making daggers go in boomerang trajectories. All the action is believable and the actors look like they are doing all their own stunts. I have already watched it twice and plan to watch it again.Very, very well-done Japanese Samurai Warior movie."
2,Good atmosphere but misses depth and realism,"This movie is trying to be great, but is kind of ridiculous. It is a tried and true plot (read: seen it), and the reliance on violence at the end would work if a) there wasn't an endless supply of enemies that far outnumber the amount there were supposed to be, b) the one who was hacked and killed didn't spring back at the end a la Monty Python with a flesh wound, and c) the fighting didn't go on, and on, and on, with enemies pausing and waiting for the heroes to turn back to face and kill them. There is such overacting and the outcome is so predictable (minus the dead guy appearing at the end) that it's really not worth the time, and doesn't do justice to the effort with the scenery. I would have liked more subtlety in both the acting and the story, and less gratuitous, unrealistic, and unimaginative violence at the end."
5,Useful hints.,This book is a welcome addition to my collection of sewing books. I like the clear instruction. These designs can be adapted to you own creations.
3,Great instructions but no music to practice,The instructions are excellent and clear. I would strongly recommend gettig CD/DVD combo that includes the same DVD. The combo is 5 stars.
4,Amy's chunks sound good but the original...,"I must admit, YES, I absolutely LOVE the duet. But seriously, I like the original with just THe dude...uhm...oh god what's his name again? Shawn I think. Probably spelt wrong but oh well. >.< But yeah The one with just him singing it is amazing as well. <3 And don't think I'm just a ""Only Seether"" Fan, either. I was introduced to Seether and the incredible music they make through the duet. ::Sigh:: If you think they suck, go listen to the songs: ""Love Her"" ""Fine Again"" ""Needles"" ""69 Tea"" And just yeah. In that order, too. XD Wow this got long, and i'm simply ranting so i'm off. Toodles (I probably won't be back, so try not to reply . XD)"
2,Ruined by Amy Lee,"This song originally was amazing, just by Seether alone. Bringing Amy Lee into the picture makes the song sound so much worse, because her voice always sounds the same and makes the song sound way worse than the original."
4,TWO THUMBS UPS!!,"OMG!! This cd, is surely differente but is one of his best too, ""VANIDOSA"", will make you dance all night long, then ""SE ME OLVIDO OTRA VEZ"".. is a song from JUAN GABRIEL and will make you sing it over and over again. The BEST SONG of this album is ""LIBRE"", for every ""free soul"".. Finish your party with ""CUMBIA VALLENATA"", for everybody with a fine ear. Don't just buy ONE.. but lots and give them as gifts!!"
2,It Was So Dull That I Couldn't Finish It,"It's rare when I...(leave a)...biography unread. But I gave upabout halfway through what should have been much more fascinating andreadable. Instead, Daniel Levy writes a rather dull portrait ofCohen, making him into just another hoodlum. There's no verve or excitement here, despite the criminal life Cohen leads in Canada or the revolutions he sees in China. It also doesn't help that this book is rife with bad grammar and sentence structure. Didn't anyone edit this?A dull book all the way to the point when I said, ""enough!"" END"
2,The Growing Child Book,The bottom left corner of the book was damaged when we received it. I usually sell my books back after the semester and now I either wont be able to or I will be penalized because of the damage. So no Im not happy
3,Not as good as...,"""Addicted to You"" is okay. Just okay. The song has great lyrics. I was just disappointed with the music though. While I loved ""First Love,"" ""Automatic,"" and ""Time will Tell,"" I wasn't crazy this song-- it's a song that takes time getting used to."
2,Did not care for the writing style,"I bought this book because I thought it would give me more insight into what it was like to live in a hill station in India as I am very interested in that part of the world. But, I didn't care for the writing style and thus didn't finish it."
1,Lighter than specificed,"The web site describes this item as follows: Product Dimensions: 16x12x13.5 inches; 4.8 pounds. This weight compared favorably with a decent 20 qt. pot I already have, so I ordered it.It seemed flimsy when I took it out of the box, so I weighed it: 3.6 lb.I'm returning it."
3,Sense and Sensibility: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is definitely great music, especially for fans of the movie, Sense and Sensibility, starring Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant.However, one big problem: this is NOT the ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack."" This is all of the music from the movie, but not presented as it was in the movie. It's the same musical themes, but performed by other than the performances enjoyed in the film itself.For instance, one of the main songs in the film, sung by Kate Winslet (or, at least, appearing to be), is instead sung by some opera singer, in opera style; not at all what I was longing for.All in all, I was disappointed, but not critically so.Bill H.Seattle, WA"
5,Patrick Doyle - a master at period music.......,"Imagine that your life as a woman is either rich and settled, accepted for society, OR, that you are suddenly thrown into a world of 500 pounds a year to live on, a family of four females. Sensible, romantic, heartfelt and realistic to the ""signs of the time"". Marriage to a good man, hopefully a gentleman or a man of fortune, without a dowry of substantial amount from the betrothed, will be by chance. Society was either rich and wealth or poor and and a peasant more or less. Patrick Doyle captures the scenes of sisters, mothers, brothers, friends, in the most elegant and realistic way. You feel as if he was actually there and making the music as the movie continues. This is my third and I have shared it with many who were delighted, moved and played at weddings. ""My Father's Favorite"" is exceptional. Kate W. sings from music Doyle has created from poems that date from the 17th century. Read the jacket when you get the CD........it's awesome....."
4,Sense and Sensibility soundtrack,"I prefer the soundtrack to Pride and Prejudice, but Sense and Sensibility has some beautiful music also if you like the classical approach!"
4,A wild and wacky story that was fun to read!,"Very witty and cleverly crafted, this is a gallant first effort by the author! It's a story of a long journey on the path of reconciliation, which takes many zany (and sometimes silly) twists and turns. The reflections of the long-dead Sandy, who is trying to manipulate her family's outcome from above, is somewhat reminscent of Debbie Macomber's angels series (I make this comparison as a complement to the author). As a Long Islander, I appreciated accurate representation of this area contained in the setting and in the references to actual real-life places scattered throughout. While there were parts that were a bit unrealistic, such as the chance meeting on the Hutchinson Parkway, the surrogate storyline, and the astrology bits, all-in-all, this was a highly enjoyable story that was lots of fun to read!"
2,If you like soap operas...,"then this book will be right up your alley. The book is mildly entertaining if you enjoy unrealistic plots. The main character is so unattractive it's hard to get into the book. The book is a fast read, but like I said before, there is so much drama that if that is not your thing, pass this one up."
1,broken,Package arrived damaged. when It was being installed the on/off switch would not work. Called seller and they want me to take the back of item off the wall and send it back with the front of item which is the part that is broken. Hope my installer will not charge me extra to come back and fix this problem if and when I get my new one from seller. They said they would send me another one but would have to send the whole damaged item back.I am not very happy at this time and hope it all works out. Will keep everyone that cares posted.
3,IT'S AN OKAY READ!,The book is okay if you want to know about how the rock n roll/music biz works and what's it like!
3,Complex..,"This book is slim on details and examples. It has complex ideas that I would highly suggest having a supplemental text for after the first few chapters. The book could be used as a supplement for an instructional course; however, I would caution on using it for self study."
5,Like Joy Electric?,Like Joy Electric? Getting into Joy Electric? This is a perfect 1st buy - you get a whole package of Joy Electric songs. A great deal!
5,Exceptional Buy,For less than the cost of cables I got a complete brake set. OK so they're not Disc Brakes (overrated in my opinion) but there isn't anything screaming 'cheap' about this set. For my Home Build Recumbent Trike these work just fine so far. For tearing down a Mountain Trail you would probably want something better but for every day sane riding Buy these & save yourself some cash. P.S. Set was complete right down to all installation hardware.
3,A girl named Catherine who can't get out of trouble.,"The story ""Wannabe"" by Shelly Stoehr is about a girl in the real life of New York City. She works at a bar called ""Gattos"". She has a younger brother who also does nothing but gets in trouble and two un-loving parents that just yells and beats them. She has a friend named Erica and a boyfriend named Joey Valentino.Her boss is named Mario and her co-worker is named Paulie. Catherine is kind of a different character in the story than in other characters in the stories you would find. She gets in trouble alot, smokes, does other drugs, and cusses. This is an emotionally powerful novel that describes with great intensity a trap adolescent behavior and beliefs."
2,Item is nice but has some flaws,"The shirt was great when I first put it on, but after the day of hunting it really stretched out especially the cuffs around my wrist and the neck area. Washed it on gentle with VERY little detergent and with a jacket, pants, gloves and more. Hung it up to dry and pretty much all the color is gone."
5,RIMBAUD - simplesmente fabuloso,"Uma fabulosa banda sonora para um faboloso filme que retrata a inigualável história amorosa de dois poetas inigualáveis. Um deles, Rimbaud, mais do que inigualável e fabuloso, é um mito, um génio, tomo quase que um deus. Por isso aconselho vivamente a todos, que vejam este filme, ouam esta banda sonora... e claro... leiam, leiam Arthur Rimbaud. Torno-me uma ópera fabulosa Arthur Rimbaud, in Uma Estao No Inferno.RIMBAUD - simplesmente fabuloso"
5,Simply Wonderful!!!!!!,this soundtrack is without a doubt one of the best that i own. the music is beautiful and relaxing. it's wonderful to listen to no matter what type of mood you're in. each peice is pretty short and runs at about under three to four minutes. if you are looking for relly good classical music this soundtrack is a must!!!
2,a reader from OK,Yeah this is a good book.....if you like fiction. I just wanted to thank you for all the false info in it you me. This book got me a successful c+ on a report for history.
1,Commercial Garbage,"Dane Cook is a master at self promotion. This explains why his core audience is 12-25 year olds, a group known for being susceptible to marketing, especially when the marketing is done by a wildly gyrating, occasionally amusing stand up comic who 'speaks their language'. I'm truly astounded at all the people on Amazon and elsewhere who call Dane Cook ""Brilliant"" or ""Original"". The man has blatantly stolen from half a dozen comics over the years, a charge he repeatedly has denied. I can understand liking him if you're into myspace and don't really care about messy stuff like current events or politics, or dont really like ""the dead guy"" (bill hicks) or ""the old guy"" (george carlin) but this is low, low comedic fare for anyone who has heard GOOD comedy."
3,Good but not great,"Retaliation is nowhere near as good as Harmful if Swallowed but that is unfair comparison. Dane hit a home run right out of the box with Harmful and it has to be tough to live up to those expectations.There are many, many misses on this CD, most of the subjects and topics are not nearly as relevant, reference-worthy, or special as on Harmful but he is so good with energy and delivery that he is able to pull of just about anything- but a lot of the new bits don't really make much sense ([...]) Audiences seem to be laughing at almost anything he says just because he is Dane Cook ans can deliver.Basically there is a lot less genious in this one, I love the 100ft Indian Aliens bit but other than that it's dissapointing.Still love the guy and think he is one of the best and most unique comics out there. I'll take him any day over the standard Leno-type current event comedians always on comedy central but he definitely has not raised the bar with Retaliation."
1,Retaliating against comedy,Douchebaggery posing as comedy. Dane's contrived hackness make Carrot Top and Gallagher look like Algonquin Round Table members.
2,His first CD was way better,"I loved Harmful if Swallowed, but this CD just sucks. I don't think I laughed at all during both of the CDs, and the extra DVD content isn't that funny either. I would pass on this one if you're not sure to spend the money."
1,Big pile of doggie doo!,Did any of the 5-star reviewers actually listen to this? I suspect that Dane cook himself is the author of 75% of these positive reviews. This one stinks to high heaven! Avoid the noid!
2,crap and poop,"i guarantee that there are very few Dane CROOK fans over the age of 35, and although that might seem like it comes from the fact that MR CROOK is appealing to the 'Hip Kid' demographic on purpose, he seems to be just releshing in the fact that younger people dont know or care much about comedy history. His animated performance is kind of all he has, i imagine that he doesnt spend much time sitting around re writing his jokes and homing his skills, the fact is, is he has a great 'in your face' delivery for the younger generation and young college girls want to have sex with him.But once you get a little older and have been exposed to quite a few comedians that really spend time writing smart jokes, MR Cook will make you cringe with the despleasure of remembering that you once thought he was anything more than a passing fad...."
2,Poorly executed Kindle edition,"This seems like a pretty decent book for intermediate players. Nevertheless, the Kindle edition is useless. The illustrations are so small on a reader that they are kind of hard to make out, especially if you use your phone to read, e.g. when you are waiting at your child's swim meet. Also, the problems and their solutions are in different parts of the book. I just couldn't use the Kindle edition because there is no good way to flip back and forth between sections. The board diagrams, the solutions and their discussion should be on the same page, otherwise the Kindle edition is useless. Stick to the printed edition."
4,Does a fine job if you take care,"I used this item to repair a worn Lay-Z-Boy chair armrest.I didn't get a perfect match on color (my choice), and I didn't do a perfect job, but it's very adequate and serviceable."
4,yes it worked,"You know what, I was skeptical but we got it anyway. We tried it on a very obvious 1"" tear on the front visible portion of our dark brown leather couch (thanks alot kids), and you can barely see it now. Pretty easy to get the right color, easy to do. Just follow the directions. Can you see where the problem is? Yes if you are really looking for it, but, it is way better than a rip or a piece of duct tape and for way cheaper than a professional repair. Worth the risk I say."
1,not worth it,Do not bother with this kit. You get one tiny piece of backing and one small piece of leather. I opened the glue and couldn't figure out why it wouldn't squeeze out. Finally pried off the top to find that the entire bottle had already dried up - and I had just opened it for the first time. Definitely not worth it.
2,Rubbery patch,"Better than nothing, but not much! Had about an inch and a half tear in a leather chair head rest.. Followed the instructions and it turned out very visible and more like a rubbery patch than soft leather. I think it will keep the tear from getting bigger but it looks terrible."
3,It worked...sorta,"I purchase this with the intention of repairing a 3 inch tear on a leather couch. I worked but certainly wasn't a ""professional"" finish. For the price, my expectations were met. Plus, I'm no expert in leather work."
5,Mendall is essential reading for financial investigators,"In this seminal textbook for conducting asset searches, Mendall's provides the tools for analyzing a subject's financial situation. The emphasis here is on painstaking research in public records to develop a detailed portrait of the subject. Every investigation of this kind starts in the local courthouse with hard work, meticulous attention to detail, careful notes, and other not-so-glamorous means of retrieving, organizing, and analyzing information in order to provide intelligence to a collection attorney. Using the techniques in this book, one can locate real property, business, bank accounts and other asset for postjudgment execution. I highly recommend this book. It is always on my shelf and I find myself consulting it repeatedly. I only wish that Mendall had included more case studies"
4,Essentials of Nursing Research,"I was a little nervous when I learned we would be using this text book for my nursing research course because I had read some terrible reviews of it before buying it. However, I think it's fine. It's an appropriate introduction to first time students of nursing research. The study guide is helpful in grasping the material and helps make the process of studying research a little more interactive, whereas otherwise it can be a little dry."
3,"Mini aquarium, 7.5 watts","The important thing to know about this little heater is that it warms up to 5 gallons of water about 5 degrees above the room temperature. So if the room the aquarium is located in gets cold at night, say 58 degrees, the heater will keep the aquarium water at about 63 degrees and similarly, if the room heats up to 78 degrees during the day, the aquarium water would be heated to 83 degrees. That's too wide of a temperature range for most tropical fish. I used this heater for about a week and replaced it with a standard aquarium heater that will keep the water at the same temperature regardless of the room temperature."
4,Worth every penny!,I got this mini heater for my betta. It really does its job! I used it for my 1 gallon tank and it keep the water temperature at 76 and above. My betta is pretty satisfying with that.
2,"Hot, hot, hot!","I purchased this for a 2.5 minibow aquarium and found that if you leave the light on ASWELL as the heater it can cause a BIG temperature jump. I mention this because my betta really got stressed from all that heat the first day - I think he got a little sick because of his clamped fins and lethargy the next day. So be careful that the heater doesn't overheat your aquarium/bowl. My idea is to leave it on at night and then turn it off during the day so that the light can maintain the aquarium at a few degrees lower, it's the best option without a 15 watt automatic shut off heater in a 5 gallon aquarium, which is probably what I will do when I can afford it next month! Good luck:0)"
1,Not Original Material,Look At The Left Hand Side of the Album Artwork. It States New Stereo Recordings By The Original Artist. Don't Purchased. I Like The Original Recordings not Newly Recorded Versions.
5,Perfect!,"I run a small real estate consultancy and these folders are amazing. They are sturdy and firm, and the clasps are good and strong. Six-section classification folders are EXPENSIVE, and we have paid 2x as much for lower quality products at Staples and Office Depot.But what I particularly enjoyed, other than the great product quality at a fair price, was that the seller, ReStockIt, was amazingly fast in their shipping. In most cases, we had our folders next-day.Since our initial order of 10 back in March, we've since re-ordered 40 more and have no complaints -- these are perfect for our business!"
1,very disappointing experience,"We ordered this pool table, that was shipped from Dazadi, to put in our Florida home. From the very beginning there were aggravations--whenever I called I got responses like: ""we don't know when it will ship,"" ""they told me it shipped,"" ""I don't know where it is,"" ""I don't know where it's shipping from,"" ""I have no idea how long it will take to get there."" When the table finally did arrive, it was in a box that was totally destroyed and the table was damaged. We were very disappointed in the packaging, to say the least! We ended up sending the table back for a refund. The entire experience was a disappointment (although I will say that the customer service people at Dazadi did try to be helpful and were very courteous). I would never deal with this company again. And I guess I cannot comment on the table itself since we never saw a good one."
2,I don't know whats cooking,Cute anime for little girls but I'm not into this cause they don't have naked chicks. This series is too girly for me (P.U.)
1,Annoyingly predictable,"Kat's book could've been A LOT better. I don't know what happened. I wanted to throw this thing away even half way thru the book. It was so annoyingly predictable, I wanted to scream. Hope the others are a Lot better. I couldn't even relate to the characters in this one. This was VERY poorly written; I mean, the ending was the best part cuz the story was over."
1,GBA Universal Adapter,From the picture it says 110v 220v. After the product arrived clearly the adapter is made for the US only. Since I thought this would work overseas this was a waste purchase.
4,The music soars,"Kathleen Battle's voice is exquisite and is suited for most of the pieces on the CD. Her rendition of Mascagni's Ave Maria is perhaps the best track, with the Schafe Konnen from Bach's Cantata No. 208 coming in a close second. Another highlight is the Laudate Dominum, delivered with so much skill and feeling.Less successful was Rossini's Laudamus Te. Battle has a flexible, clear and delicate voice, but not one that's full-bodied enough to accommodate the style of music found in a piece as grand and strident as the Laudamus Te. There is a sense of strain when she sings it, though it is by no means entirely unsuccessful."
1,You have to be a Parcell's fan,"Unless you are diehard Parcell's fan this book will not give you any coaching gems other than over the top personal stories of motivation through intimidation. I was impossibly looking for a secret outside of the standard work harder approach. In Parcell's I found it. Work harder, while micromanaging, and threatening everyone around you, until success is achieved then jump ship when the boat eventually sinks, (as that kind of environment can not exist in the long term), and go on to create the same hostile environment somewhere else. While Parcell's is innovative and a sound offensive/defensive mind, his management style is similar to Brian Bosworths playing style, (i.e. Get in, get as much money/success as you can in a short amount of time, get out)."
4,a good introduction,"The ""I Ching"" is an ancient classic and a complex work, not readily grasped by the western mind. Down through the ages, it has been adapted to many uses, especially for philosophical speculation by the scholar and for forecasting the future by the layman. The scholar would more likely prefer the editions by Edward Shaughnessy or Richard John Lynn which have extensive annotations and footnotes--not meant for practical daily divination. This edition, by Palmer/Kwok/O'Brien, is a wonderful popular version for the layman, and a practical one adaptable for daily usage, in the same vein as ""The Illustrated I Ching"" by R. L. Wing. It has a very good introduction as background material, and a clear explanation of the three-coin and yarrow stalk methods. Like Wing's version, it also has the original Chinese text for the ""judgments"" and ""line commentaries,"" a useful feature for those interested in actually checking the translation."
2,Maclean over analyzes,"What a stark difference to the Poetic "" A River Runs Through it"". This book is just a scientific analyzation of this history of the Forest Service. No Poetic nature of the ""River"". Who can explain the reasons... Maybe telling his own story was the only way to tap into the deep reminiscent type emotion. The ""River"" was a monumental book."
4,Somewhat uneven,"Like the ground upon which the Mann Gulch fire was fought, I found this book to be somewhat uneven. There are large portions of it which I found to be quite good reading. Any woodsman or firefighter will find the book worthwhile. Other portions of the book tend to drag a bit, at least from my perspective. The other downside was that the book tends to peak your interest and then fizzle out at the end. Recommended only if you have a special interest in the subject matter."
4,Very Informative,"I'm a retired volunteer firefighter, and the bulk of my firefighting was structural. I married a firefighter, and the bulk of his firefighting is wildland. This book helped me understand much of the wildland side of firefighting. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a wildland firefighter in their family. You will understand some of the things they talk about, like the difference between a Type I and Type II team. The stories related to Thoele from the firefighters were great, and the pictures are extraordinary."
2,Not a good book,"This book has some good information. This book is unlike any other book I have text I have read for college. The chapters in this book vary greatly in lenght the chapter headings are poor. Chapter heading in my experience give the reader a clue to the subject matter, not in this book. It difficult to revisit information due to the index/glossary information. Reading this book I felt many times smarter than its authors. They may know the subject matter but they presented the material poorly at best. My college professor felt the same way about this books 5th edtion.Good luck to thoes who are stuck with this textbook."
3,Pure novelty...,"Jazz and classical music collectors alike will find this disc a joyful romp. The selections are drawn from private collections of 78 rpm records, Columbia and affiliated labels, 1937-1947. Sony, employs from the Netherlands remarkable sound engineering and restoration on each track. Formidable lack of hiss and distortion is achieved through the process. The instrumental detail from the mono recordings is truly enhanced. Besides the bands of Miller, Goodman, and Herman; lesser known artists who would have gone down in obscurity are also featured. Some of the jazzy/classical arrangements will have you toe-tapping or foxtrottingaccross the room. At the very least, the informative booklet will help make this set a conversation piece."
5,My daughter LOVES it!,"My 22 old month daughter Loves it as much as she did ""Beginning Together"". I don't like Matt's interaction with his daughter as much as I do Brandy with hers (in ""Beginning Together"") but my daughter doesn't mind so why should I? Prairie Dawn's Mom's look confused me as well but again, my daughter is ok with it. I just figured she changed her look just like real people do. I recommend this video for the teaching of senses. It made me realize that I can do much more than I have done in the past. I just purchased ""Make Music Together"". I hope she likes it just as much as she does the other two."
2,not happy,"Its hard to stick on, doesnt adhere very well.it is very brittle tears as u work with it.once you manage to get it on it more or less ok, and its wonderfully transparent"
2,Not strong enough for repairing the bindings of books,"We did a big service project of repairing the broken hymnbooks in our church. There were over 100 books, and we were teaching ourselves, so we tried this book tape and then clear shipping/packaging tape. They were basically the same. We didn't like them because the clear tape made the books look cheap. But the real problem was that as we followed online instructions on how to repair the broken and torn backs, we found that although this tape is heavy, it tears easily. Many of the covers were torn in the top where the spine meets the front and back. And this tape gave no strength for this repair.We eventually found a book binding tape made of vinyl coated cloth that works perfectly. It is strong and looks great on the books. We found it here:[...]We have no agreement with Demco and they are not compensating us in any way. I would just like to save anyone else from all the trial and error we went through before we found something that works."
4,Great,"There really isn't anything bad I can say about this product. It worked very well at stablizing, holding and protecting my worn books. On more than one occasion, I was relieved to have this tape at my disposal and because of that, I will now have many more years of enjoyment out of my older books."
1,Hydor Theo Submersible aquarium heater,I received this heater on 11-3-11. It lasted 36 hours before it blew out the bottom of the heater and electrified the water causing my husband to received an unpleasant electrical shock. I bought 2 of these heaters at the same time so at this time the failure rate is 50% . I'm waiting for the next one to go. Would not recommend this heater at all!
3,Buy it for the music,"This might be the worst RTS game ever, but the disk plays like a CD (just skip track 1) and you can tell they put effort into the music.Strictly bargain bin stuff, but I especially like ""It's a Nice Day for a War"" - track 10."
4,Easy to fix if not working,I was very skeptical about buying after seeing so many people say the FLO broke shortly after purchase. I had mine for one week and it too stopped. I like to work on things rather than throw away and figured it would be easy to take apart. There is a white snap connector on the front of the FLO and you simply push it together and the entire device comes apart. In my case a small saltwater snail lodged inside the gear that rotates the FLO and I simply rinsed off the part and put it back together and it works fine. If you have any issues take this apart and there are really 5-6 parts that make the entire unit up so it is easy to clean or fix. Now knowing how easy this is to fix I wish I had it long ago. It does a great job of mixing the water flow from the nano tank pump in my Biocube. It is a very good buy in my opinion and necessary for any nano tank.
3,The making of a corporate athlete,This is really an abridged version of The Power of Full Engagement (which is an excellent book.) If I hadn't read it first I would have enjoyed it more.
3,it's just alright,"the thigh toner sure works, but the material that it is made out of is cheap!!!the joint looks like it's gonna break anytime soon while you are using it.I do feel sore on my inner thighs. Good product, but again...the cheap material makes it not worth to buy."
3,One of Canada's singers,"Line Renaud's best known song ""Ma Cabane au Canada"" is featured here. It is a heartfelt tribute to Canada from a native of France. The rest of the album alternates between simple tributes to marriage (Les Noces de Maria Chapdeleine"" to French renditions of songs like ""Linda"" and ""Bleu Lavande"" (Lavender Blue)to love songs like ""Nous deux""Line has a pleasant voice which resembles that of singer Mathe Altery. The album is worth getting."
5,Solid bang for the buck,"Excellent set of speakers for home entertainment system. Easily as good as my buddy's Bose set at 1/2 the price. Speakers look sharp, build quality is excellent, and packaging complete. Instructions brief but minimal; no problem, these are speakers after all."
4,Do whatever you want,"I love Barbies. They are a great line of dolls that have tons of great accessories! And the best part of all, is you can do whatever you want to them! I like dressing mine up in wacky outfits and making them dance silly to cool music. Barbies are a must-have. They're easier to manipulate, easier to boss, and are also just better. Period. If you don't have this Barbie, you should get it. She rocks."
5,Performance Management,"Effective Book a must for all HR Professionals, different perspective from the traditional approach"
2,Wrong choice of repertoire,"I'm afraid Jane Eaglen has chosen the wrong repertoire for herself. There's no doubt that her vocal production is quite beautiful, although her tone is unremarkable and her top range isn't that brilliant. However, her voice often sounds unwieldy and out of sorts in Bellini. Such monotonous delivery and laboured florid runs just won't do. In Wagner, her voice is also not too expressive and there's not sufficient variety in expression. All in all, a dull album with unimaginative, and at times unidiomatic, singing."
1,Belcanto ? Only an optional...,"Dagli anni Cinquanta, quelli della Belcanto-Renaissance (non solo Callas: Gencer, Scotto, Zeani, Sutherland, Caballè, Sills...)la riscoperta del repertorio belliniano non ha avuto soste. Si è ascoltato di tutto: l'algidità della Anderson e le asperità della Aliberti,la friabilità della Moffo ed il rigore inam idato della Devia, e adesso anche la Eaglen. Che non possiede alcuna idea del fraseggio belcantistico, risultando il suo legato sempre troppo tirato, la pronuncia italiana scolastica (ogni accento della frase è buttato via senza alcuna passionalità romantica richiesta all'interprete). Wagner è uno dei tanti possibili, pura routine."
5,Great and Quick!,"Got the cd a day early! Came in well packaged, cds were not scratched at all and everything was professional. Would recommend media mogul."
5,"good music, great price",k-young is a good underrated artist.i love his musici love the pricethank you amazon
2,Only lasted 1 year,"Worked great at first. Then, a year later, the thermostat started to drop the temp all the way down to around 65 degrees, then up to 86 degrees the next day. I lost a 6-year-old fish because of it. It does have a 2-year warranty though. It says to return to place of purchase. I still had the receipt and pet smart took it back."
2,Lasted 22 months,Thermostat eventually broke on my unit & unfortunately we didn't catch it in till it took a couple fish with it. Temp was set at 77 degrees but unit heated the tank to 84! Tried lowering the gauge but got the same results. Bought this over other models in hopes it would be long lasting & dependable but it's going to the garbage can.
1,Not worth it.,"I thought I had read the description on this thoroughly enough but apparently not. I didn't realize that there were only FIVE episodes in the whole thing. It seemed like this would be really amazing for my one and a half year old. Yes, she did enjoy the first episode but after I realized that it only had a couple more I decided I'm going to return it. I would never pay over $5 PER episode of anything!! Of course, yes, there is extra material on it but not like my 1 year old is really going to care about that! I suppose if you just like to collect things like this and don't just want a good compilation of sesame street than this would be fine."
4,A trip down memory lane,"On November 10,1969,""Sesame Street"" made its debut on public television-It became an immediate hit with the preschool set-Sesame Workshop,formerly The Children's Television Workshop,is now releasing the early episodes of this landmark show-You get the first show from each of the show's first five seasons-It was a hoot to see Oscar as an orange Muppet during the first season-That was rectified by season 2-the bonus features are quite memorable-Who could ever forget ""Rubber Duckie"" & ""I Love Trash""?-Recommended for kids as well as kids at heart."
5,Big Bird would be pleased,"Great purchase, start to end. The Amazon presentation and purchasing process was easy and rapid. The product arrived sooner than promised. The item is as described, a classic for the ages. Even Oscar would be happy about this purchase!"
4,So excited! Now a little let down.,"I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive.When I put it in to watch it, well, I was a little sad. I had somehow convinced myself that I was getting ALL the episodes for the seasons, which is silly given that it was 5x a week. But still, you can't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head, so color me disappointed.TBS, what is included is great. I'm sad to say DD is unimpressed, but that's because she's jaded. I'll work on her. They note at the start that it's for adults and not ""today's preschoolers"" which is odd to me. It's Sesame Street! It's always been for preschoolers. Are ours somehow more advanced than we were??"
1,Disappointing,"This DVD compilation was sent to my son for a birthday present, so I never read any reviews. I had expressed an interest in ""Old School"" Sesame Street because the ones on television now are horrible. A friend found this and sent it. I cannot believe she paid so much money for FIVE episodes! Considering the fact that these shows are over 40 years old, you'd think the Sesame Workshop would be more interested in sharing all the old shows for this price than five episodes. Instead it feels like a really big rip-off, a scam to make more money. I'm even less impressed with the makers of Sesame Street after receiving this DVD set than I was after trying to watch the new episodes. Guess Sesame Street will be off our rotation for good."
3,Useful DVD Set for Childhood Memories,"I'm glad the first five seasons of Sesame Street have been released on DVD. Yet, I found a problem. The first episode is edited. Who would ever like anything edited on a DVD? Not me. I would rather hang in until Volume 2 or 3 gets released."
3,For Adults?,A disclaimer at the beginning of the DVD said this was for adults and did not necessarily suit the needs of pre-schoolers of today. I don't think it was a joke.
1,couldnt stand it,"honestly, these ""old school"" dvds are not that great. i hated vol 1, vol 2 was okay but generally these are really boring. my daughter loves sesame street and paid these no mind at all."
5,HAVENT SEEN IT YET,"Hi there;very excited about this purchase; all I wondered was...is the ""E "" song on here; involving a Neil Young/ Dewey Bunnel sounding guy singing about an Eagle and an an Egg etc; my favourite childhood tune...xGonchy"
5,Its in his bones,"This is the most amazing blues album I've heard in a long, long time. This man has style that cannot be learned. It has to be in your bones or acquired at a very young age. He takes each one of these blues classics and makes them completely his own and in doing so, he makes anyone from the Bronx ( like myself ) really proud. Thank you again Dion for proving you can sing with anyone who put on rock-n-roll shoes. Buy this CD folks."
3,It's a Sleeper.,"The songs on this album have been done numerous times by the likes of the legacy blues musicians, the Doors, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, Allman Brothers, Grateful Dead, and the list goes on forever. It would have been very difficult for Dion to put a different spin on these songs from others, especially with only two acoustic guitars.This is a GOOD slow tempo, acoustic blues album with Dion delivering his trademark; flawless guitar playing and expressive vocals.For someone who may not have blues as their main course when listening to music, this is probably a good album to own.Since blues is my main diet when listening to music, I found the album pretty bland and lacking originality (these songs have been done to death).Just an OK album to me."
5,"Dion- ""Bronx In Blue""","This is classic Dion, outstanding. Great acoustic guitar and the recognizable vocals of Dion. All but two songs are blues covers of standards, but in Dion's inimitable style. Dion's two originals are also excellent. This CD will go down with his best works."
2,Forget the rubber feet.,"Works as intended, but the rubber feet will fall off (and get lost) the first or second time you use the kickstand. If you are using the kickstand on a surface you don't want scratched, you'll need to glue the rubber feet, protect the floor with something, or get a different product."
5,Wonderful!,"This brings me back to my childhood. A wonderful Christmas special that never gets old, year after year.The DVD was exactly as described, wonderful quality and a blessing for my family to have this special- our old VHS tape of this special was worn out after ever-year-watching since I was about 3 years old, when it originally aired! So a DVD was exactly what we needed!If you buy this product and if you miss the old time celebrity Christmas specials, you will NOT be disappointed"
2,Not what I expected!,"I was really looking forward to this DVD. It looked like a great concept, Oscar the Grouch as Scrooge. However, it really wasn't that great. It basically uses the older Sesame Street Christmas episodes (Christmas Eve on Sesame Street, Elmo Saves Christmas, and Elmo's World Holiday) as the past and present. I expected more of a storyline with all new footage. Also, the ghosts are not puppets, they are animated (and not that well, might I add). They seem really fuzzy and don't fit in.I bought it because I have long been a fan of Jim Henson work and have collected most of the regular movies, etc. I don't know if kids will even like this. It just seems geared toward an older age group. There's very minimal Elmo, which some might see as a blessing. All in all, I was very disappointed."
1,Sesame Street Christmas was a bummer,"I was so excited to get this DVD and soooo disappointed within the first few minutes of it. I turned it on for my 19 month old, who loves elmo and friends, and her friend. They were excited when I told them what we were going to watch but were obviously disappointed very quickly. The story is the based on the Christmas Carol Movie, which is too old for kids who like elmo/sesame street.It was a total waste of money!"
5,Top Notch American tool,The tool performs well. The price however is MSRP. Buy it at a retailer and save the S & H.
2,Starret really likes their product,"As a woodworker and jointer I think the allure of the Starret brand is tempting. Practically speaking they are over priced. Claiming precision that is way beyond the accuracy of even the best woodworkers and the best chisels, saws, planes etc. does little to improve the quality of the product even when the claims are true. I'll stick with my $6 dollar, probably also more accurate than I can cut or measure, Chinese square and save my money for a better saw, chisel or plane where it does make a difference."
4,Great way to organize CDs or DVDs,"I really like using this kind of sleeve to organize CDs and DVDs because they fit into binders, making it very easy to keep media organized (if you alphabetize). The sleeves are well built. My only complaint is that they are quite tight, so it's difficult to put a CD booklet in the sleeve."
4,Love it!,"Love this product! works great, only thing I don't like is you can't just take the top off the re-fill it like the feeder. Other than that Love it!!"
4,Impressive debut,"Our local rock station started playing ""Dogmatic"" awhile ago soI couldn't wait for the CD to come out. A very good effort and arefreshing break from the usual nu-metal that makes up mostof the Ozzfest lineup. Best description would be a heavier version of Filter. Tuned down guitar crunch with alot of samplesand trippy effects. The singer has very good range going from melodic to belting out screams and growls with the best of them.""Weakness is my STRENGTH!"""
4,Get in on this,"I discovered this band 3 days ago at a rock festival when a member approached me with a set of headphones and asked me to listen. I loved what I heard, and bought this CD off of him. Later that day I saw their live show, it was awesome. This is my new ""it"" band- the one I tell all my friends they have to listen to. You should too! They are sincere, nice guys from California. This record is great- pop punk type sound, not the most original, but it's got style. Lyrics are great. Definetly advise you to purchase this."
5,These guys ROCK!,"These guys are so fabulous. They seem to cross a number of genres with their sort of indie-rock. Just give them a listen & you'll be hooked! Not to mention that they are a terrific group of guys, super nice & all around great people. Give them a try. I promise you'll like it."
5,educational reading for the un-initiated,"As a father of a newly minted Marine who did not have the honor of serving this is a truly instructional book bringing home the real Marine. Fully immersive and descriptive it takes you alongside the Marines, (as much as that is possible), and teaches you the jargon and the landscapes and the hearts and minds of the young men and women who sacrifice for the right for me to right these very words.I feel that I have not given David Danelo his do as a writer! This is an extremely readable book that translates well to those who are not necessarily interested in a military narrative. Danelo's narrative sprints along making this a true page turner. It is the kind of book that you get to the end and find yourself looking up the author hoping for a sequel. Awesome, incredible book!!"
4,Good read about the Marines,"This is a good book for those, like me, who like stories about our fighting military. No doubt about it - the Marines are onetough group of fighters. Pretty much the best of the best."
3,Not a bad start,"While this is not one of Green's better stories about the Empire, it is involving and introduces us to some great characters, such as Investigator Topaz. I just wish Green had spent more time in developing a satisfying climax."
3,they're ok,"I like the fact that you don't need tape for these (front windows)but, the one on the passenger side doesn't seem to fit perfectly. The reason I say that is because to roll the window up tightly I have to push on the window to keep it in its track. Other than that, I like the way they keep the rain from coming in the window if the window is rolled down a little. We have yet to put the ones in for the back windows I know that they do require taping."
1,Definitely Not the Original Vogues,"The Five O'Clock World recording on this CD is the same as the one on ""The Vogues - Greatest Hits: Finest Performances"". Both are the ""fake"" Vogues. For more details see the reviews here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000003QUOTo get the original Vogues hits by the original Vogues group, buy ""The Vogues - Greatest Hits"" available here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000032CU"
5,Catechism vs. the Bible,"Mr. Gendron does an excellent job of showing the difference between the Bible and the teachings of the Catholic church mainly found in the catechism. He doesn't insert his opinion, rather he quotes Catholic teaching and counters it with Scripture.It is essential for all Christians to understand the difference between the True Gospel of Jesus Christ and man's ""redemptive"" gospel of works upon works. Learn the difference so you are better able to recognize false teachings and lack of Biblical discernment which is rampant in the Church in America."
1,More of the same under another name.,"This book is just more of the same anti-Catholicism that our fathers and grandfathers generation grew up with. The arguments he puts forth against Catholicism are the same arguments that have been put forth since the reformation, and the standard anti-Catholic rhetoric comes into play (e.g. He accuses Catholics of worshiping Mary, even when Catholics themselves deny doing anything of the sort). He frequently twists the Catechism to suit his own purposes by not providing the quotes in context, and saying a word means one thing when to Catholics it means something entirely different.If your a Catholic steer clear of this book.If your an anti-Catholic Evangelical looking for confirmation that you made the right choice, look no further for the propaganda you seek lay within."
1,Bigoted and prejudiced,"Mr. Gendron runs a Hate Catholicism ""ministry"" from Plano, Texas, and has been described by NON-CATHOLICS variously as ""petulant, hateful, full of bile, spiteful, a vicious bigot, half-informed, prejudiced, and arrogant.He sets himself up personally as judge and jury for all of Christianity, and thereby excludes Catholics from the Body of Christ. The book is the usual twisting of Scripture and deliberate misreading of Catholic doctrine that is the meat of professional Catholic-haters.It is fortunate that most Protestants and Evangelicals extend their hands to Catholics as fellow Christians and reject the misreading of Catholic beliefs that Gendron does. The book has value to those who, like Gendron, hate Catholics and wish to reinforce their prejudices. All others are well advised to avoid this wind from the Pits."
5,excellent,"i first became introduced to these working for an attorney friend in DC --- they are easy, do not bend or get worn the way paper folders do, and they make a nice statement when passing documents to a client, friend or whoever... also great for filing..."
5,"IF YOUR INTERESTED IN THE HISTORY OF SALT, THIS IS A GOOD ONE","This is a basic history of salt the the salt industry up until 1948. It is quite well researched and has some very nice black and white photos and prints scattered throughout. When you first pick this one up, you think to your self ""hmmmm, a book about salt, probably as exciting as watching grass grow!"" Not true. This is actually a pretty interesting and fact filled book. It is quite well researched and quite well written. The book deals, for the most part, in the American salt industry, but does go at lengths into world background. This is a rather nice book to add to your collection."
4,Un articulo aceptable...,"Coincido con la opinion de que el producto esta ligeramente abajo de las espectativas. Particularmente el caso de la iluminación, podría ser más intensa y no requerir de poca luz para que se note. Por otro lado, es dificil sacar los discos, y hubiera sido de gran ayuda que pusieran alguna proteccion entre ellos. Este producto es aceptable para los amantes de la pelicula, o para aquellos que gustan de las ediciones especiales.Para mi lo mas relevante que me gustaria señalar es que la edicion cuenta consubtitulos y doblaje al español latinoamericano, lo que es muy importante para los compradores de esta region, y que es algo que no se menciona en la descripcion del producto."
2,"Waste of time, and money.","I kept waiting for it to get exciting, interesting, or just almost as good as the original Tron. It never happened."
1,Packaging is Horrible,"The movie aside, Disney should be ashamed of themselves for releasing a collector's edition with the this crappy mold-injected packaging and broken LED lights."
5,Excelent Edition,"It 's amazing package color. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too."
4,Awesome,"This combo pack gives you both Tron Classic and Tron Legacy. It is light on extras if you don't have the Blu-ray player, but if you have the equipment, you have a great pop culture package."
4,"Great movie, lousy collectable packaging.","I had this set on pre-order as I'm a big fan of the original movie and enjoyed the sequel to some extent.After watching this unboxing video for the collectable 5 disc pack, I've decided to cancel my pre-order asthe packaging just looks cheap and tacky. Instead, I'll be pre-ordering the standard 5 disc set.[...]"
4,Lots of fun,"This was great, I had already seen the Latest movie, but it is worth seeing again in 3D. I had not seen the orginal Movie in many years so it was nice to catch up. The 3D effects are really good. My son, who had never seen either movie loved them both. Great Price and lots of extras and video."
2,Doesn't heat up the water enough?,"I got this as a gift for my GF's Betta that is in a 5gallon tank. The thermometer never passes 75, even when the temperature is turned up to the max of 88 degrees. I'll let another week by and update. I gave it 2 stars because it does heat up the tank, from 60 to 75, but it doesn't heat up to the correct degrees on the dial."
5,Worked great,This little guy worked just as advertised. I had it in the tank for over a year before I sold the tank and had 0 issues... matter of fact it's being used by the next owner still and he has no issues.
2,Very accurate but died after 3 years.,"It's slim and attractive but kind of long for such a low power heater. The temps are accurate and consistent. I never had a problem until it just stopped working after three years of moderate use (rarely kicks on during the 4-5 warmest months of the year).Hydor only has a 2 year warranty which is mediocre at best. In contrast the 25w Hagen Elite Mini has a lifetime warranty and is $5 cheaper at the time of writing. Also, Hydor requires you to register on their site to download the product manual which is ridiculous... Really Hydor?I expect a ""quality"" heater to last much longer than 3 years. I've had $6-$8 ""cheap"" heaters last longer. In fact, I dusted off a [heavily used] 15 year old non-submersible penn-plax to take the THEO's place until the Elite Mini arrived."
2,Works Great For Frying Fish,"I have two 5 gallon tanks for my kids and three of these heaters. One appears to be working fine, and the other two overheat the water no matter where the dials are set. I rated this unit 2 stars because when the unit works it works well, but 1 out of 3 working points to a quality control issue.I believe the manufacturer may have had a bad run as other reviewers are pretty positive about it, which was the reason I chose this unit. I am contacting the manufacturer."
2,Won't heat above 74,"I don't know if I got a defective heater or if this is how they all are, but my heater won't heat the water in my 5 gallon tank above 74, even with it turned up all the way. I will be returning this and getting a different heater."
1,only works when it wants too.,This heater worked for all of 3 seconds when I put it in the tank. I am very disappointed... and so is my turtle.
5,Belkin Network Cable,After installing my new computer I was not able to connect to the internet. The error message that I was receiving usually indicates that the network cable is defective so I went to Amazon.com and selected the Belkin Snagless CAT6 Patch Cable hoping that it would solve my problem and sure enough it did. I was so happy to see the modem lights flashing after I made the connection from the modem to my computer.
2,Not remotely on par with his last 2 albums.,It sounds like he's poorly imitating himself on this one. If you want to hear some excellent slice and dice hip-hop glitch instrumentals go with Vocal Studies & Uprock Narratives or One Word Extinguisher.
2,Not A Bargain,"This radio arrived poorly packaged, which probably had something to do with the fact that the LCD display did not function properly. Some of the fields did not display at all, and the ones that did were not that easy to view. Viewing angle is critical for this display, and if you are looking at the display on the same level, the display is not clear. If you are looking downward at the display, you can see it much better. Unfortunately, if you put this on your nightstand, you're probably looking straight at the clock which means a poor display. I returned this clock radio and got the MIDLAND WR300 Weather Radio for $45 and I was very pleased with the upgrade. I am glad I didn't get stuck with this radio, and for a few dollars more the Midland is a much better value."
2,Unable to read display,"This was 1 of 2 NOAA weather radios I ordered from Amazon.After unpacking and preparing to program it I found that the LCD display was defective out of the box. Several of the characters (made of 7 or more lines) had one or more lines not functioning. On one character only 1 line was functioning. This made it impossible to program or even select a radio station.Have now packed this up for a one way return trip, but, am unable to get a return label so I have to pay shipping and have them credit. Was shipped from one of Amazon's partner stores."
3,Some Praticality But Not So Clear,"John Gray takes a fairly open minded stand in this book. Throughout each chapter, Mr. Gray tries to emphaize to people not to take things so seriously. By taking what you can have and enjoying the pleasures of what is given, one will find diminshed stress and the ability to heal.Some of the healing techniques seem a bit undeveloped and a little out there. Mere simple words have a limited healing effect. What is needed is attitude adjustments and Gray presents that fairly well. Also, the history of change over different time periods is fairly interesting and how it relates to relationships. However, this book has some psycho babble and is not totally down to earth. Some interesting points but not too deep. I borrowed this from my liubrary and would recommend others to do the same."
5,corelle,"I have the set/olive branches and like the rest of corelle, it is light weight, easy to handle and store and keeps it's color. Happy to see that cereal bowls are available now !"
5,Worked for me,"I took this religiously throughout the cold and flu season, when everyone in my office was falling ill, and I never got sick. I plan to take it every winter or whenever there's a virus going around."
5,Buy it before it comes off the market!,"Like I said before, ""Buy it before it comes off the market!""Enough said."
2,Not the best whitener out there,"Honestly, Crest White Strips do a better and faster job. When I recieved the package, the tube of whitening stuff had broken open and squirted all over the box, even damaging the packaging. I decided to go ahead anyway. The molds worked fine, the paste tasted horrible, and I could only use one mold at a time, doubling the time I had to wear it. After the recommended usage time, I did not notice much of a difference. Like I said, get Crest White Strips instead."
3,A bit too complicated,"I purchased this product because I was in need of a teeth whitening kit to use over the summer. I read over the previous reviews, and decided to purchase it.I was unaware of what was inside this box, so I'll just explain it for those who are in doubt.It comes with two wax like teeth trays, that you place in boiling or hot water for 20 seconds, and place them in your teeth to mold. If you aren't satisfied with the fit, just dip it in hot water again, and it will re-mold. I loved that. Also came with whitening gel and a final mouthwash.Tried the kit out, kept it in my mouth for 20 minutes (which was the suggested time) and didn't really see a difference. Only saw white spots in my teeth, and it's a tad too complicated for me, even though it's summer, still a bit busy, and I'd rather use whitening strips or something, but I bet the results are satisfying. I just have a short intention span."
2,Mapping Series Helpful for Novices,"I've studied astrology for 20 years and numerology for about 15. I have two books from this series. (Mapping Your Birth Chart and Mapping Your Soul's Purpose) I find them both incredibly general! The disk included in both were a nice touch, because I don't need to pay for charts or dig up a free site... The disk is what you pay for that holds any value. Otherwise, the information contained in these books can be found on line at various sites (skyview, cafeastrology, astrology.com...) However, I do believe it's a great help for beginners. Whether you're a novice or advanced, DON'T pay full price if possible..."
3,"Decent Sound, Pathetic Construction","I've had this product for a few years. The sound quality is decent and it does what its supposed to however its construction is pathetic. I had to taped the battery cover so I wouldn't loose it. I wouldn't recommend using it to listen to audio especially through its built in speakers because it will drain the battery very quickly. One more issue is its battery life. I take out the batter after every use or the batter would be dead if I wanted to use it the next time, and this seam to happen even if I separate the body from the battery cap."
2,Other much better choices,I bought this without inspecting it in any brick and mortar store based on some favorable reviews. Opening the package I was startled to see this toy. Small in electronics is usually good. But this is so undersized that using the controls is like threading a needle; it takes your full attention. Not really handy if you make personal notes on the fly or want to listen quickly. Second issue was the construction. It's made of a plastic that seems to scratch if you just look at it. I thought iPods were prone but this lowers the bar. The sound quality is ok but not spectacular. I was actually relieved when my luggage was stolen and it contained my recorder. With my compensation I'm looking at the Olympus DS-40 or DS-50. The DS-40 is priced similarly to this unit but has 512 mb and the DS-50 is about $100 more for 1 mb. This time I want to physically see the unit first before purchasing. But I would never consider buying the WS-320M again.
2,Compilation of banalities,"The book to me was useless. There were a couple of items that may have been useful, but overall this was a compilation of banal truths that you can find elsewaher and written in more amusing manner. I don't recommend it."
2,OK read,best and very worthwhile for beginner or novice investor but not especially useful for the more advance stock trader
1,YAWN,"I collect postcards, and I LOVE the books and movie,so I bought this postcard book. Harry wasn't my favourite character, so I was dissapointed because there were only a couple Ron ones. I wouldn't buy this book if I were you!"
5,The Stunning Conclusion to the MATADOR series!!,"This is the Third book of the Trilogy and the build-up is absolutly worth it! The action is both brutal and climactic as The Man Who Never Missed and his small band of Matadors challenge the despotically corrupt and failing Confed Empire and it's twisted and dangerous backer, the ""kingmaker"" Marcus Jefferson Wall, the most powerful man in Human Space. A man who will stop at nothing to see Khadajii and his Matadors dead and their dream of freedom for the peoples of the Confed utterly destroyed!!"
1,Save Your Money!!!!!,"This book took only 1/2 hour to read. To summarize -- do a background to check their facts, and if they look away during an interview, they are lying. This book describes nothing about cultural differences in body posture that may affect an interview, and does not describe body postures (other than the eyes) that denote a lack of truthfulness. He does not provide enough information to differentiate between nervous interviewees and liars. His examples are basic and purile. What a waste of money this was!"
4,Smells great,"Bought this as a Christmas gift. Person I gave soap to has received multiple, positive comments by guests using her powder room."
3,"Very authentic, but very modern.","Although Dimitri Mitropoulos was one of ""Titans"" in the 20th century, this performance is very modern."
4,Nice tape,"The tape's alright but I didn't like the price. It's a little bit too expenseive. Otherwise, I'd have given it a 5"
5,There is no other,"These old Szell recordings are pure gold, all of them. While done in 1958-1960, you really wouldn't notice all that much, the CBS recordings of that time are so good, and the remastering so well done. I own a few Schumann sets (The live Bernstein one from the 80'sand theDohnanyi set) and neither compares to this one (why I, or anyone else, would have multiple copies of complete Schumann symphonies is another matter). Szell shapes every phrase beautifully where others just seem to run right over them. The 3rd is particularly wonderful."
4,Hard to beat Sawallisch,"Much as there is to admire in this set, Wolfgang Sawallisch & the Dresden Staatskapelle on EMI own the Rosette for their rendering of the Schumann symphonies."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:I know it's sacriligious to even hint at this, but I don't think Duck Soup is a very good film: its ""anarchy"" means it has no real plot, Harpo's antics are no more clever than much of what Jim Carrey does, and even the immortal Groucho delivers his witticisms in a flat and perfunctory manner--it says a lot about the film that its best gag (the mirror scene) was stolen from Charlie Chaplin."
4,Time Defying.,"I'm not a person who loves The Three Stooges or any of the pre-World War II physical comedies, but I find the Marx Brothers fascinating. Their humor was more cranial and challenging than that of their peers. For me, whenever Groucho suddenly appeared in the film, I inched forward and did not want to miss anything. The name of his character alone, Rufus T. Firefly, will make you laugh. This is light, happy stuff and that's exactly why their films will be treasured forever. There's a need for mirth in any age."
4,Great movie but lip-sync problems,I won't add to what everyone else has said about this great film - but my copy of the DVD has lip sync problems that start at Cicollini's trial and run through almost to the end. I got it cheap so I won't complain but I think Image should have been more careful regardless of the price.
2,Duck Soup (1933),"The Marx Brothers were the very much the forerunners of present-day comedians like Jim Carrey and Tom Green. This movie is loaded with crude humour and cheap laughs, but to my tastes, most of it just didn't seem funny."
2,RANCHO STINKS!,After all my research I decided on these shocks believing they were the very best BUT after I installed them on my Toyota 4Runner I hated them. A very hard ride and there are two vinyl dust covers which come with each shock with no instructions on how to secure them. I had an awful noise around 65 mph and it was these covers so I had to improvise and placed tie wraps on the them but I still have the same noise.I have learned NEVER to buy anything other than OEM from the dealership Toyota.You can't beat the quality of what goes into a Toyota 4Runner.I have tried after market brake pads and they were terrible too.Toyota parts cost more but sure worth it.
