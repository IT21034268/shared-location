4,Good book,"While I don't think you have to run out and get this supplement, I also feel like it adds a lot to the game. Not only are there some new feats, equipment, and prestige classes, but of even greater value are some of the sections which discuss new spins on existing rules. There's a few pages, for example, which go into the ways in which large fighters(or monks... scary), such as giants, can use the class feats and abilities to make the most of their size. For me, just the fact that I took another look at the existing rules would've made it worth the money I spent."
4,Rule #1: Never talk about Fight Club!,"Since my earliest days as a player of Dungeouns and Dragons I have played a human fighter... it's a running joke in games I play... People anxiously ask me what I am going to play, grinning all the way... because it is well know that Brian ONLY plays Fighters...Welllll, if they wanted that to change they shouldn't have published Sword and Fist. Now I have:30 New Feats, 21 New Presige Classes, Over 4 pages of Combat Tactics, Options for Monster-Fighter PCs, 5 Pages of New weapons, 2 pages of Vehicles and Castle plans.To keep me excited about playing a Fighter... though I will confess that I AM excited about the Upcoming ""Song and Silence""... I have this idea involving a Fighter-Barbarian-thief... hmmmmm"
1,Return,Too hard to work with. Do not like the calendar organization. Should return it. Common sense cooking works better than the recipes
4,Healthy; Great organization; Long prep,"I've used this recipe book for 5 weeks, and used the grocery list each time. I love making my grocery shopping trips quick and easy with this cookbook! I am also diabetic, and found that these recipes were low to moderate in carbohydrates, and offered the nutritional information I need. The recipes are also low in sodium and fat, which are other things I watch for. The down-side though, is that though most of the recipes said 25 minutes to prepare, most took 60 minutes (getting on the long side for me). I'd love to see these recipes updated to incorporate time-saving techniques."
2,Repetitive theme with inconclusive ending,"The first book is great...afterward the series went very bad.I got sick of hearing ""life is sacred...etc"". Where is the true ending?This third book feel like that there will be endless sequels becausenothing is done except uniting the Kat and Martin to the family. The book has some mistakes if you cross reference to the first and second book. Nothing is new in this book except creating more loose ends."
1,a back ordered product,has been on back order for over a year...i believe i am off the list as it was taking way to long for this mdse
5,Versatile storage,I really like these storage containers. You can store all kinds of different things in them. I like that they are clear so you can tell when you are running low and that they &quot;snap&quot; tight when you close them. I have had no problem with them sealing and keeping things fresh. I used a permanent marker to write on them so I know what's inside (wouldn't want to mix up the plain and self-rising flour). I also like the molded grip. It makes it easy to carry and they don't slip out of your hands. I'm asking for more for Christmas this year.
3,For little kid bikes?,"First off, I don't know squat about kickstands and somewhat blindly (well, i knew the frame size) thought this would work for my wife's bike. Apparently it's for tiny bikes b/c the stand length is so incredibly short, it won't work on even the smallest adult bikes.On it's own merit, it seems well made and has multiple positions that allow some flexibility of use. However, it is surprisingly heavy, especially if you're going to be putting it on a small and light bike."
5,rear kickstand,This was my second kickstand purchase for my daughter's bike. Her bike came with training wheels so needles to say it didn't come with a kickstand which is frustrating. I ordered another kickstand but it did not fit on her bike- the design of her bike didn't allow for a standard kickstand so I found this one and I love it. It is sturdy and attaches easily and the bike stands without issue- it is a rear mount but is sturdy enough to support the bike!! Great product !!!
4,"with it came for 26"" bikes","Didn't fit my 26"" mountain bike.. yeah I know.. should have known better. But I did like the design. Mainly because my mountain bike spring system tends to make the kickstand fall down when I go over bumps sometimes.I did come up with a solution though.. don't know if it will work over the long term, but we will see. Got a short spring tension rod (from the curtains section of any major department store), and 7/16 to 29/32 clamps that I found in the plumbing section of lowes, and also a greenfield kickstand foot, and now it does fit. Although not as stable as I like with a regular kickstand."
4,"More information, better pictures than I expected","Details on the development and production of the PT Cruiser, with notes on the show cars that led up to it, engineering choices and tradeoffs, and lots of very good color pictures. Answered a few of my questions (e.g. why Toluca, is it on the Neon platform, how did they get it approved!). Surprisingly good book given the time the Cruiser has been out and the potential for scamming on this popular car."
3,It's okay,My first soccer ball for my kids who are 5 and 7. It's smaller than I thought. I would go for one size higher. Quality is okay too.
5,Love it!,I love this series! I'm waiting for coffin club..the story is really great and the love story part is really romantic!
5,Amazing Book!!!,"This book was an absolutely fantastic read! It had a little bit of everything: teenage angst, love, mystery, suspense, comedy, anything you could ask for in a book. I highly recommend this book for a teens! *TWO THUMBS UP*"
4,Teenage love story,"I have to say, this book is great! i'm not a big fan of reading but once i started reading this book, can't put it down! the plot is pretty well develope and so were the characters. Through out the book, i can see how Raven character began to mature more and so does her view about the people around.the only part that i did not like was the ending. To me, from the summary, it was very predictable. But i did left me hangin there. Once i was done, it was like, ""what? that's it?!"" i expected a better, more well develope one. Hopefully, there will be a sequel. other than that, this book is a must read!"
2,Good book,"This book was THE most cliched vampire novel I have ever read. It had a 'dark' all black wearing girl named Raven (ooh very original) who lives in a small regular town...blah blah blah.I admit I hated the lack of lets say originality? But I still enjoyed the book, read it in about 2 hours and liked it. Besides the cliched plot the book's voice more than makes up for it, the humor the author put in the book is the most enjoyable part. That is too the only original bit of the book.It seemed as if some random comedian with a fetish for vampires decided to write some amateur story and get it published. But this book is good to remind you just how good the original vampire plot can be.So if you want an easy cliched vampire book with much humor read this book."
2,Not the best I've read,"Now, I could just be biased-I'd just finished ""New Moon"" by Stephenie Meyer the day before-but I honestly can't say I was very fond of this book. There wasn't really any character depth and I have serious doubts Raven (the main herione) would act the way she did half the time; it just didn't fit the persona at all. Like I said, I might just be biased, but the authoress didn't even put her own spin on the whole Vampire legend, or make the existing belief interesting. But, I will say it was an interesting enough read to finish. That much I can give it."
4,"Adorable book, quick, fun and easy read","My husband brought this home to me while I was pregnant and I was quite skeptical. I thought, another vampire book, great. But it was a really fun read. It's not bleak and dreary, it's fairly realistic and it's just a fun little romp, even for adults."
4,Weight Watchers Quick Meals,"Great recipes with a lot of variety. Good pictures for those who need to ""eat with their eyes"". Unfortunately this was published before the point system was instituted so points are not included in the nutritional info. That is the biggest drawback to an otherwise timeless, well written book."
4,Great Book on German Soldier,"How often we have been told that Wehrmacht or the German Soldiers are demons but if we read this book carefully, you wud know they are just the same as us with flesh and bones, fear, hatred,comradeship as well as the loyalty to their motherland. With this book, it tells you every act or move of the German Soldiers particularly of the Sharpshooters.The last chapter on the last stand in Berlin is marvellous.It is vivid and it is real.Look at the poor Russian Soldiers rushing forward with the order from their command.Marvellous book.I wud give it a 4 Markes"
1,One Star is too generous..,I can't believe the reviews for this book. It is pure fiction from a poor author. I would have enjoyed when I was thirteen and fairly ignorant of WW2 but I like to think that even then I would have chucked it out. I couldn't finish it; what a waste of money and valuable reading time.
1,Terrible,"This book is absolutely horrible. I was unable to read more than 5 or so chapters of it. The viewpoint constantly shifts between the listener of the story and the grandfather's first-person depiction of the war. This is completely unnecessary and serves only to break up any small amount of interest or tension that may have been building. The book feels as if it was written by a high school student, meandering around and never really going anywhere (not to mention the gross historical inaccuracies).Skip this and buy 'Sniper on the Eastern Front' instead. You'll be glad you did."
5,It's great,"I found this book to be easy to read and digest, as well as highly entertaining and educational. The sheer number of battles covered makes it a good book to have, as many are not mentioned in most history books (like the battle of Svastopol)."
5,Among my favorite books,This book made me laugh and cry several times. It is the only book which has brought out such emotions in me. The ordeal which Jeorg the sniper has to undertake to survive the war is just amazing. What's even more amazing is that it's all true. You can imagine the sounds of battle because they're all familiar sounds (sort of like when you read a Star Wars book). Let's all hope humanity never has to go through a war like that again!
3,Grandfather's Tale: The Tale of a German of a German Sniper,"Generally a good read with lots of action. Very entertaining. Could have used some more research. But Jeorg may have been given to quite a bit of hyperbole. Some of those shot distances w/ a K98K and the number of kills? Our top Sniper in Vietnam had 93 confirmed kills w/ a lot better outfit. K98Ks' are good, but not great. But I guess that's why it's called a tale. It was interesting and I did learn some things."
2,Entertaining but bogus,"First off it must be understood this book is entirely fiction, there are so many mistakes it's hard to decide where to start. Georg Frick ( the hero? ) claims to have killed several thousand enemy soldiers as a sniper. Pure B.S., the top scoring German sniper had about 345 confirmed kills and if you tripled this number with unconfirmed kills it doesn't come anywhere near the claims of this soldier. The unit he was assigned to ( the 4th Parachute Division ) didn't exist until Nov. 1943 and was composed of units from various brigades ( including some Italians ). No Paratroopers were in the initial invasion of Russia ( they were being rested and refitted after Poland and were sent into Russia in Sept. 41 ).He only gets wounded once in 8 years in the army and Germany didn't have any sniper schools until mid 1943. They were inspired by the success of the Russian snipers. Like I said, entertaining but not to be taken seriously. Books by Sven Hassel are a better read."
1,Not good,"Research man, do some research. If a person wants to read about a German para, try Heaven and Hell, or Hitlers Paratrooper, or something else. Just not this."
1,Jesus wouldn't practice deceptive advertising - unlike this publisher,"If you're thinking about buying this book, you ought to know that this isn't really a full-length book, it's actually an excerpt from ""Imitation of Christ"" by Thomas a Kempis. I think it's really deceptive for the publisher to take a piece out of a Kempis' book (I doubt a Kempis would have approved), change the title, and market it as a new book (""hey, maybe we can get people to think it's actually a new book instead of just an excerpt!"").Don't buy this book, buy the full-length one, which is superb (see my review of it). Shame on the publishers for their deceptive advertising... especially since this is a book about imitating Christ. How ironic - in a sick sort of way."
2,HoW?,"I wonder how some books get published? Don't get me wrong, I got the symbolism and the subtlety of ideas. There are some things that are very sharp about this novel; Whitehead's use of language is superb. But there's a missing link - I didn't identify with Lila Mae (whose lyrical name totally belies her flat personality). I couldn't get through this book at all. There is just too much to wade through to get to a story that isn't there. I always say that people need to think more, but I had to work entirely too hard to get Whitehead's point."
5,great read,"Whitehead is one of the best authors writing today. His prose is sharp and engaging. It is hard to find a non-commerical book that holds the reader's attention like this novel. I just happentd to stumble across this novel amongst the piles of crap at Barnes and Noble. If you like Whitehead, try Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" or Travis Craig's ""99 City"", two other author's who I just happened to stumble upon and love."
2,This was not a labor of Love,"This is by far one of the boringest books I have ever read. I was laborious to read. THe reading does not flow well it jumps illogically in various parts. You don't really care for the characters or what happens to them you just want to put this book down. Also, I think it was poorly written."
2,I wish he'd just say it sometimes!,"I also really tried to get into the book. I read it slowly, understood the symbolism (most of it) but everything took too long to be told and too long to unravel. Must everything be so thoroughly described? Sometimes I wished he would just occasionally state something, anything. When he was writing dialog it was good, otherwise- too much for me. (and I read Ellison et. al.)"
5,"Brilliant first novel about race, epistomology, and elevator","When I first heard this novel was about elevator inspectors, I was more than a bit skeptical. I'm so glad I went ahead and read the book, because THE INTUITIONIST is one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time, both for its fast-paced plot and the ideas behind it. GET THIS BOOK!"
4,"A powerful, energetic read","I came in a little nervous; racial allegories tend to be a little heavy-handed. The Intuitionist had just the right amount of subtlety, and stands up as a straight mystery too. Although the place seems to be some version of New York, the perceived era is always in flux; is it the turn of the century, modern times, or some other time entirely? It raises questions about how much progress we've really made.The Intuitionist has its share of surprises and twists. Lila Mae is a strong, no nonsense protagonist, and a pleasure to follow into politics' seedy underbelly."
4,Not Haggard's best but still Haggard!,"She and Allan was an almost obligatory novel for Haggard. Since Allan Quatermain and Ayesha are his absolute best characters it stood to reason that he would combine them for a single adventure. Unfortunately, it reads as if written from an outline for a ""typical Haggard novel"". There is the feel that Haggard himself just couldn't get excited about the book. Still, it IS Haggard, and worth a read. It only fails in comparison to works like King Solomon's Mines or She. In fact, if you are looking for another rousing Haggard novel, try Nada the Lily or The People of the Mist. They are both superior to this book. If you can't get enough of Haggard (like me) then She and Allan is worth a read."
5,Pleasing and well-written.,"A fitting finale to the Obsidian Chronicles. This books is vastly underrated for the level of quality it possesses. I can find no flaw in its continuity, yet its characters are flawed and real. It is a fit addition to any collection including the Sword of Truth chronicles, the Dragon Jousters, or Robin Hobb's several winners. Indeed, it is at least worth the price and the time it takes to read it. It left me pleased and satisfied. A++"
4,"Actually, four and a half","I can't give this 5 stars, because it's just not a classic, but this is a great moment in rock, and a true precurser for events like Live-Aid. Well recorded and exuberantly performed, particularly the Preston and Russell segments. Also, you can feel the excitement when Harrison laconically introduces Dylan, and Mr. D does not disappoint with a great performance. Not to be missed."
2,just an ok toy...,My parrotlets don't really care for this toy. They pay no attention to the mirrors on the toy and the biggest attraction is the beads in the bell.It is by no means a favorite..
3,Misrepresented,"The product picture shows a full kit with 2 balls and DVD, so you'd expect to see these things when it's receieved. Think again! No balls are included, just a DVD. The product desc mentions nothing about ""balls not included"". The DVD itself is OK as it has some decent techniques not included in the original Petrone kit."
4,a snapshot of history,"From the cover art to the lyrics, this album offers a trip back to a brief but prodigous era of pure American music. The folk artists' melodies captured here represent some of this nation's best and brightest singer/songwriters. What makes this album special though is consistently appropriate voices to cover the original songs. Besides the history lesson and the great music that flows from this collection, the other reason that recommends one to purchase this album is the label. This independent NY label has produced nothing but quality works. The only downfall of this entire album is the overall morose tone that the covering artists laden the songs with."
2,Tremendous dissapointment,"Congratulations to the producers for helping the normally reliable Patty Larkin sound more bored than world weary on ""Everyone's Talking"". The production excesses on this disk are too numerous to mention. Special thanks to Cry,Cry,Cry for stripping Paxton of his direct simplicity by paying more attention to gimmicky harmony than the song. Paul Brady does a fine job of revealing how truly vapid is ""Get Together"". A couple of songs like ""My Back Pages"" stick close to the original and work reasonably well. This fluff is not the best folk music had to offer in 1999. What the producer wanted to reveal in these songs(and that remains a mystery) is masked behind drum machines and overdubbing that just rob the originals of their immediacy. Truly poor."
5,"Those were the days, and so are these.","Many of the great old folk-era songs are given capable and respectful new recordings. Some are letter-perfect covers [Marshall Crenshaw is basically doing a Byrds impression], others wander more in new arrangements. The lesson we learn, as with many such tribute albums, is that the songs were good enough to stand up to reinterpretation. Well worth the click."
3,"Yay, Rhino...BOOOOOO, Rhino !","Okay--another great collection of MST episodes. I'm a long -time fan-- no stranger to the old ""Best Brains"" shop in the industrial park in Eden Prarie. Congrats to Rhino for keepin' 'em coming.But.MY copy of the set has TWO disks of Disk 1 (""Boggy Creek"") and no Disk 2. Great. So I have Disk 1, Disk 1, Disk 3 and Disk 4.I wouldn't complain, but this is not a new problem to Rhino. Complaints of similar problems haunted Talking Heads' box set last November. People shelling out big bucks to find mutliple copies of the same disk.So Rhino, if you read this, be more careful with your Quality Control and packaging. And while you're at it, send me a Disk 2.cyberyukon@yahoo.com"
4,Time Chasers,"Time Chasers the special anniversary edition is now available through Edgewood Studios. The DVD offers new features such as director and actor commentaries, deleted scenes, and ""Memories In Time"" reunion documentary. You can find it at EdgewoodStudios.com!!!"
5,No tabs,"Normally I put a tab on the sections that I want to remember. I have not put any tabs on this book because every page is memorable. I have read many books that have helped me get through difficult times, but this is the best. It is written from a Christian perspective, but I believe someone from any faith would benefit from this book"
1,These are recordings of songs pre-1974 - this is NOT new.,"This is yet another packaging of songs that were recorded by Lou Gramm in the very early 70's - even prior to his stint in Black Sheep in 1974. It was recorded under the band name Poor Heart. In the late 80's, to capitalize on Lou's solo releases, people who had ahold of the master tapes from the Poor Heart sessions released it as Poor Heart featuring Lou Gramm. These recordings from that release keep resurfacing again and again under many different titles - always the same songs. It's not a bad CD - but just realize that it is not new recordings, regardless of what the release date says."
5,Good reference guide.,Quick Review:Doesn't blab about how webstandards are so important.. yada yada yada...Just gives examples of how to write better XHTML/CSS code in an easy to read format.A good addition to the arsenal for any web developer.
1,Memory of Blood,"I didn't like it from the beginning, but persisted in reading more in hopes that it would become interesting for me, but it didn't."
1,This is available is School and Library binding??,I pray this (or any other book on this topic) finds it's way to any bookshelf and especially a school! Disgusting!
3,Dated and overrated,"Semencic's 'The World of Fighting Dogs' is essential reading for anyone interested in the fighting breeds. It is essential not because it is a great book, or even a good book, or because it contains information which is not presented elsewhere, but because people interested in this topic have been influenced by this book more than any other. This book is biased towards the American Pit bull terrier. Several other breeds are not, as the blurb states, covered in-depth. Some breeds are allocated a few words and the breed standard (which can be obtained anywhere). Also, while the book has a number of rare photo's a lot of others are simply taken from other breed-specific T.F.H. publications. The worst flaw with this book is that no references are provided for any 'fact'. It is dated and contains no information which cannot be found in other, more detailed, books"
1,watch out! the features are a facade for the poor sound quality,"I rarely write reviews, but feel I need to warn people about this phone. I purchased it because of the handy features, such as speaker phone and quad band coverage. However, I immediately noticed when talking on the phone that the sound is choppy or echoes. It happens almost every time I talk. At first I thought it might be the reception where I live, but my wife's Samsung phone rarely has choppy sound. I have spoken to the techs at T-Mobile, and after running tests to find out what the problem is, they sent a new phone (plus $9.99 shipping). The new phone had the same problems. My recommendation is not to be pulled-in by the nice features this phone has, and to choose a different model with much better sound and reception."
1,Poor Quality Lasting just past the 1 year warranty,"The biggest problem started shortly after having had the phone for only one year. I am disconnected when flipping it open to answer a call. Now I flip it open then press answer. I sometimes still don't get the call because I can't answer fast enough because it takes the phone time to stabilize to being flipped open before I'm able to answer. This phone is a perfect example of throw away technology. It's as if it was made to last a year and no longer. I'm very disappointed. It puts you in a position of having pay for another phone,change carriers or sign up for a two year contract in order to get a new phone. So much for customer service and standing behind your product. I've also had, and continue to have, problems with intermittent volume changes during a conversation.This phone is junk when compared to the Nokia (least expensive model) I had for almost 7 years (only giving it up because technology made it obsolete)."
2,Beware,"I have had this phone for over a year, and it worked great at first.Now, I can hardly get a signal, even near a cell tower!!My family can use their cells in the house, I can't even get a signal across the street! Avoid this phone! I thought maybe my sim card was bad, so I swapped it out and tried my card in my husband's phone. It wasn't the card, it is the phone. I talked to a dealer, and she has had several v-188 phones returned. Stay away from this phone!"
2,Not So Moto,"I upgraded to Motorola V188 from Sony Ericsson with T-mobile as my service provider. The phone looks amazing with its nice GUI and other graphical features. It is sleek and nice to have.But during my two years of service with T-mobile, I never had any issues with dropped calls as with this phone. On an average I get see two-to-three calls being dropped. The conversation gets disconnected; People cannot hear to what I am saying. I am finding ways to not to use this phone anymore.I am Not so happy with this Moto Phone..V188"
3,Nice little phone but...,"I have been using V188 for 7 months. It is nice and small to fit in my back pocket. The speaker phone is nice.However, it seems to hang up the call middle of the conversation!Also it is a bit slippery.It is also hard to open so consider using both hands. while driving, although is not safe to use any cell phone, using your earphone is a must unless you want to get your hands off the wheel to answer the call.Using the voice dialing is a hassel since you have to use the nav botton to get to it. It is easier to dial it! A down grade from V60-V66 with side botton for faster voice dialing.I got the phone because I wanted Motorolla and a small phone. I am ready for a chage, may be T809."
5,For only those who WANT to succeed!,"No bells and whistles or complicated, superficial language. This book is straight forward and if followed is sure to bring success to its readers! I have not read a book in some time (and very few) from the perspective of a person who is realistic and focused on the true tools to achieve. I will be purchasing one of these books for every athlete I know as well as struggling professionals. If at such an age this man has this much wisdom, it would be a sin not to share. If I were you, I wouldn't let another day go by without this information...this is if you truly want to succeed, or just want to sit around and talk about how you ""wish"" you could. Buy it today!"
3,System of a Down as an alternative???,"While I agree there are better Skrewdriver records, that is not the point of this review since anyone reading it probably already knows that, and either owns them on vinyl or has heard them many times at parties. I am more amused by the comment about System of a Down being a better band and also comparing them to DK. Hilarious. It reminds me of when a hc or punk band covers Skrewdriver at a show and all the little kids run around and love it, never realizing who it is!!"
4,Very Good Filter.,"I purchased this filter as a replacement for a stock filter on my S&S 107 with a Super G Carb. I was looking for something that had a little more performance and was completely washable and reusable. Well this is the filter. From the moment I replaced the old filter with this one I immediately could tell a difference. The motor ran much better, especially during idle. The actual filter, which for some reason is not shown in this product description is even ""tear drop"" shaped to match the stock breather. I will probably switch to a different intake in the near future, but as long as I use the stock ""tear drop"" one, I will use this filter."
5,Learn from the games of best chess player....,Most of the games of Capablanca show his brillient positional play style. Especialy the end games are superbs. So anyone who wants to understand chess better should examine these games and i can say that best way to understand chess is by means of examining chess endings and best way to do is to examine Capablanca's games...
5,Vital fo Genealogy studies,"Anyone doing research into family histories in New England must have a copy of this book for foundational fact-finding. Through this book, I was able to link my ancestor to the New World, the ship he rode in, and the year he arrived in the New World. For years I had searched online, and not found this information."
5,Awesome!,"Little kids love playing with buckets and stacking them. This toy gave both my girls (1 1/2 & 2 1/2) hours of enjoyment. Since this has the toy sorter component as well, it helps keep all the buckets stored together with a lid and handle. These ones may be a little big for bath time use since they could hold a lot of water, but my girls just sit on the floor and play with them. I would definitely buy this again."
1,Does not work,I tried this product and would not recommend it. It dried out my hair and I did not see any improvement in my hair. I should have known because its only a shampoo and like most shampoos it will only clean the hair. What would help is if they come out with a shampoo + conditioner version so that it can clean an treat your hair.
1,SCAM DO NOT USE,went through 3 bottles and i have lost more hair. I switched to regen pure after a lengthy article stating that it works better. I am using that along with nioxin (which is supposed to give it volue). My hair loss comes from the front. I am also using a minoxidil product as well. I will update in a month. BUT AVOID THIS PRODUCT. It's basically rogaine using their name to extend their product line to shampoos.
2,Disappointing.,I did not see any results using this shampoo that would cause me to want to endorse it to anyone else. Thinning hair sucks and so does this shampoo. Sorry.
3,Just shampoo,I am an older woman have been using 5% rogaine over a year (under DR's supervision) with great results.I was hoping for a little more response from this compatible product. For me it does nothing more than my usual shampoo as I can tell. If you use Rogaine the shampoo is worth a try. Maybe you will see some difference. I will probably order again because of compatible idea.
1,Disappointed,"More of a ""MANTEL"" item then a play truck. It's quite small and a bit fragile. Not exactly what I expected of a Matchbox item."
2,Interest Fates,"This book would have been much better if Mallaby had written a biography of Wolfensohn and stayed away from the high school confidential aspects of investment banking. Wolfensohn's life is interesting enough without all of the unverifiable back biting that is supposedly documented by the author. Though uncredited on the cover, Wolfensohn dominates the story from beginning to end. What I really want to know is how this man managed to move from Australia, convince a consortium of creditors to forgive Chrysler, and give a voice to the world's poor? Two words that Mallaby should have emphasized in regard to Wolfensohn are, based on the evidence presented, most applicable: successful and effective.This book will make a great template for a more skilled writer who seeks to write a comprehensive book about Wolfensohn.GBoydWashington, dc"
3,Another reason to abolish the World Bank,"The World Bank has done nothing more than enslave the people of lesser-developed countries in sweatshop labor camps to help their countries claw their way out of debt traps, while the leaders of these countries steal the funds and export it to Swiss bank accounts. This account of failed World Bank president Paul Wolfenson's term demonstrates again how big money doesn't help LDCs to improve the livelihoods of their people. I really recommend this book, especially following the awarding of a Nobel Peace Prize to someone who understands the principles of microlending. Microlending will help many more people get on their feet than these huge disbursements of World Bank cash that prop up corrupt governments that oppress the poor."
5,Kay Starr's commercial recordings for Capital...,"Since Kay Starr's roots were in jazz, her commercial recordings as middle of the road as they are, are still very enjoyable. If you listen to Patti Page's greatest hits they sound dated and she sounds awful, yet you listen to Starr's hits and they are still classy and are of interest to jazz collectors, Starr had(and still does to this day) a bluesy Jimmy Rushing/Connee Boswell influenced voice(Starr replaced Boswell in Bob Crosby's orchestra in the 40's, hence the influencial New Olreans drawl). Starr was unique and jazzy even in the most middle of the road tunes like ""Bonaparte's Retreat."" But before buying this CD try these three essential recordings by Kay Starr ""I Cry By Night"" with Ben Webster, ""Movin'"" and ""I Hear The Word""(the only one not yet on CD)"
4,I got what I need,As a for-pleasure photographer I don't want to carry multiple lenses and travel around. So this lens is exactly what I need.
3,Small and cheap-looking,"I guess I got what I paid for because it wasn't expensive. Type in the book was sort of blah and it was a smaller book than I thought. Pretty skinny. But still, in good shape, and most important part is what's IN the book, which I enjoyed. I wouldn't spend to much for it, but it's a nice read."
2,A long awaited collection but..........,"Could have been a great ""Best of"" collection, but three excellent songs where not included: ""Hold On Hold Out"", ""That Girl Could Sing"", and ""For a Rocker"". What a disappointment after waiting so long."
3,"Better than ""The Next Voice You Hear"", but....","Jackson Browne's first compilation effort was such a disappointment that this two-disk effort almost had to be better. However, as several other reviewers have noted, ""The Very Best Of Jackson Browne"" still falls short.Frankly, Browne's early albums are over-represented here (14 of the 32 songs are from the first 4 albums), causing many wonderful mid-career songs to be omitted (including ""Chasing You Into The Light"", ""For America"" [US #30], ""That Girl Could Sing"" [US #22], and ""My Problem Is You"").One and two-disk compilations are meant for the more casual fans. There's really no excuse for such an expansive collection to leave out so many charting singles and oft-played album tracks (particularly when a number of fairly mediocre 70's-era songs are included in the first third of the album). I suggest people keep waiting for Jackson Browne's definitive collection..."
5,My dad got me into it,"I remeber when i was younger my dad had this collection. It was one of the only cd's he actually owned. He would alway play it like, every time we were in the car and at first I hated it. But now after a few years i decided to look up Jackson Browne and I love it. All the songs. Songs like The road out/stay are marvelous masterpeices. I could name many of my favorites but that's up to you. anyway i like it at least..."
3,"Easy on, easy off but no big difference","I used this product after using the Mothers clay bar system and applying Mothers carnauba wax. The top coat went on and came over very easy, similar to the Mothers carnauba wax. I can't complain about the ease of use, but I did not notice a great difference in shine or texture of the paint. I have a 2007 Mazda 3 and the paint (phantom blue mica) is still in great shape. I also tested this product on a 2004 Nissan Sentra SE-R (Black paint) and still didn't see much of a difference on top of the Mothers carnauba & clay bar combo. Perhaps if you're using a lower grade wax, this would make a more noticeable difference. I found that when used in conjunction with a high quality wax like Mothers carnauba, the results were not worth the effort."
2,Bare Minimum -- Crumbs to a Starving Man,"What a disappointment! There were eighteen races in the 2010 season. Each race lasted an average of 45 minutes. Couple this with practice, warm-ups, and interviews and each race should have at the very minimum one hour of coverage. The *single* DVD presented is 180 minutes long. You do the math.This is the absolute minimum that they could offer, I guess. It is, to me, a rip-off that takes advantage of the hunger that we have for the sport and the lack of competition.That's my two pence..."
3,"A good, but not great, 'one-stop' source for baseball stats","Purdy's 'Encyclopedia' tries to go beyond the usual 'stats and lists' format, although there are plenty of lists for season and career leaders. The sections on individual players are nice, with some well-chosen anecdotes fleshing out the familar stuff true baseball fans already know (i.e.'Lou Gehrig went to Columbia U.')The weak point of the book would probably be the team history sections, which are, if anything, too concise in baseball info, and too wordy in historical background on every owner of every team.Perhaps if Purdy updates this work, he'll flesh out the tean info. As it is, he's made an impressive rookie debut as a baseball historian."
4,santa biblia - version reina-Valera 1960,This bible has very clear view and gives me peace whenever I read it.
5,Refreshing and exciting perspective,"Marva Dawn illustrates her deep love of the Lord and commitment to the scriptures in this fantastic exploration of Sabbath. Her goal is never to legislate a particular practice, nor to settle the sat/sun. debate. She cuts through these relatively less significant details and presents a well written and compelling call to incorporate the ceasing, resting, embracing, and feasting of the Sabbath in your own life. She offer numerous suggestions for ways we can incorporate Sabbath into the fast paced lives we so often live. I hope this book helps you develop a real and active understanding of Sabbath in your life."
5,Life Changing,"This book is one of those that will always be with me. I read many books and there are only a select few that make a huge impact on my life and that I remember always. This is one of them. Marva Dawn makes the point that you can accomplish more in 6 days with a Sabbath Rest day than if you work 7 days without, much like a tithe. This is a subject that the church has to a great extent left out of its teaching in many years. I believe this is the answer to the problem of all the rage we have in this society. People are pushed to the limit and take no time to rest and recuperate and draw close to the Lord."
4,Enjoyed It,"I wouldn't follow this book in everything nor agree with everything said, but its full of helpful thoughts on theory and practice regarding setting apart the Lord's day as a day of rest, refreshment, and feasting."
5,This will become an American bookshelf classic,"This book is the kind one buys for sisters, friends, family, teachers, weddings, birthdays, and anyone that wants to make a house a home. (I bought extras for my gift closet.) The fill-in pages at the end of each chapter personalize it and make it a treasure book for the family, something you would want to pass down to the younger generations.The words are timeless, like a long lost great-aunt encouraging and rooting for the reader. Yes, the nuts and bolts of keeping house are there, but the real charm of this book is the way the author encourages the reader to find the sacred in the ordinary and every day. I love the charm, wit, and wisdom and the fact that I can pick it up and read from any page and carry something away with me. (I love books like that in my chaotic life!) I think this timeless book will be around for a long while and become a classic, much like The Joy of Cooking."
5,Beginners will like this.,"I wanted to find a ""how-to"" book that will get down to the nitty gritty and this book did it for me. I was able to do a simple reading over the phone for a friend as soon as I finished reading the first part of the book dealing with the Major Arcana. I like how this author has the information organized. This book was very easy to use. I would recommend this book for any beginner."
1,cheap,The material is very cheap and it is smaller than I expected. I haven't used it so I don't know how well it will hold up over time.
3,good dvd for boys (mainly) aged 7 and above,"The dvd has a lot of action (sometimes less is better). Even though my son could not follow the story line, he realy liked it. He said the cars and the races were real cool. Maybe when he turns 8 he will better understand what the story is about."
4,Fun!,I would have to say that the music is awesome and the story line is just fun for any guy or gal who is into cars and sci-fi. It opens up a world of imagination.
3,Scumbuster,"While this machine was not the miracle worker that I thought it would be, it has definetly helped me in the bathroom. I no longer finish scrubbing the bathtub with a severe backache--it has taken the gruntwork out of cleaning for me. For truly ground in stains, I found that I still needed to soak the surface with cleaning products for about fifteen minutes or the scumbuster did no good."
2,Not nearly powerful enough,"I was extremely excited to receive this product but was quickly disappointed when I used it for the first time. I was hoping to either save a little time when cleaning the bathroom or at least saving some energy. I wasn't able to do either. The rotation speed of the cleaning head is very slow so it doesn't seem to do that great a job. I can do a better job on most areas by hand.The only thing I found the ScumBuster good for are the corners of tiled areas. Using the narrow brush it's easy to clean the areas which are difficult to get by hand. Otherwise, I wouldn't spend my money on this item!"
4,I Love this thing!,"YOu don't have to apply pressure, when you do it does slow the thing down, but its not necessary to do to get a great clean. If I need something lifted off, I too, turn it on its side and it comes right off.It cleans my grout wonderfully!My kids love to use it so house cleaning is now fun and not an argument.My only comlpaint is I cannot find anyone who sells the additional attachments."
4,So handy I brought a second one when the first died,I bought one of these a few years ago - it was very handy but didn't last long. I hope that was a problem particular to that unit and not all scrubbers. I like the product so much that I bought a second one. While useful in the bathroom I also use the scrubber in the kitchen to occasionally clean the sink and counters.
2,Just about what I expected,This product is what I expected for the price. I knew by being great neck and the price that I was not buying top of the line tools. This product performs at about 2 stars because it is not high speed steel and it needs sharpened real often. It is a sturdy in construction but a higher quality steel would have been better.
2,Keep it Moving- Not Much to See Here- Don't waste your time.,"I am a huge MotoGp fan and figured I'd see some great up and coming footage of my favorite MotoGp hero's here, which is why I eagerly bought this one as soon as it came out. I dare admit I actually pre-ordered it here at Amazon. Ulitmately was pretty disapointed. Although somewhat interesting at first as they go through the current field of MotoGp riders starts it doesn't really go anywhere from there or show how they developed from there to where they are at now. I had big hope for this video, assuming fullishly that it might take us nearly up to date or close to where these top riders have made it since their earlier days, but it really doesn't and disappoints because of it."
4,What did you expect?!?!,"For the price and size of this black and decker, I think that you get exactly what you pay for. I use it instead of a dustpan, for spilled odds and ends, lint on rugs and various other tasks. [It]has more than payed for itself. I think that we have to be reasonable and know that if you are planning on doing some major cleaning, skip this and get out your kirby!"
1,2 Freezing Nights,"I tried the Slumberjack Ultimate Extreme 20F on 2 seperate camping trips, 26F, 35F. On the 35F trip I was uncomfortable but managed some sleep. On the 26F trip I was freezing. Lucky for me, I had also packed a Fleece Quilt.SlumberJack""s degree ratings are incorrect and they over rate their products. I would not recommend any SJ product for this reason."
3,Free and Clear Hair spray,This really doesn't have any odor which is what I wanted but it also has very limited holding power. It says you can use it for styling also but this didn't seem to add anything.
4,Adddional resource,"This is an additional resource to my Spanish-English software, audio CD's and internet forums and online dictionaries. Very helpful when on the go."
4,1001 Most usefull Spanish words,A limited vocabulary is a real challenge for beginning speakers and this is helpful for a beginner's encouragement.
1,Practically useless,This book is practically useless for someone traveling in a Spanish speaking country. It is just a short list of Spanish words in alphabetical order accompanied by the English equivalent and a Spanish sentence containing the word. There is no conjugation of verbs or declension of other words. There is no pronunciation guide. If you are an English speaker hunting for the right word you cannot find it unless you know it and then there is little additional information about the word when you do finally happen upon it. Get a good Spanish-English dictionary instead.
5,best 2 bucks ever spent,"This book is everything it claims to be. Extremely good value at only $2. A translation dictionary with examples of the words used in a sentence, in both languages. Even a vocab tip page in the back to help with prefixes, suffixes, and pronunciations. More useful to a traveler than a traditional English-Spanish dictionary because it's only a few ounces and is cut down to the 1001 most common words, about 850 more than you will ever need on vacation."
2,Whatever . . .,"This book is really a rather humdrum effort which doesn't do much to showcase Ms. Linz's particular talents. The plot is utterly predictable, and after Rad's initial visit to the grade school, the humor level plunges--a big disappointment considering what this author's capable of. Even the usual pokes at the military mindset don't help much. The story is livened up slightly by the presence of the Polish grandmother, but this is basically one to skip. Plus, it's somewhat racier than most Silhouette romances."
2,Not useful,"After reading Oswald Chambers' My Utmost for His Highest for a couple of years, this all-year devotional fell terribly short of my expectations. The format is this: verse, excerpt from a writing of Packer, and a reflection question or statement. It's often difficult to see how the three connect. The passages leave me wondering what the point is. If you have better luck deciphering the page, good luck trying to apply it.In short, it's a poorly designed, quite irrelevant collection of passages that are too short to stand on their own with purpose and conviction."
4,Great Resource for Morphosis Admirers,"As an architect, I have followed Thom Mayne's work for a long period of time. I have collected most of his books and have always admired their production quality and most importantly, the depth of the work produced by this firm. They have been and will remain at the forefront of the architectural profession. Despite reading and studying Mayne's work and philosophies in other books, I have always been left unsatisfied, not knowing exactly how the firm works and how a project comes together within their office. The interview with Jeffery Kipnis and Todd Gannon at the front of the book enters into this territory, although I would have liked it to be much longer. The rest of the book is much like other Morphosis' books; full of beautiful sketches, computer renderings and drawings. Images walk the reader from schematic design through completion."
2,not advertized price,amazon has this listed for $5.38 click that link and its $9.38 what a way to get someone to look. Ted
4,essential for understanding movement,"As part of the required course work for my Pilates certification, I now use this book frequently for reference as I try to explain complex body mechanics to my clients."
5,Must have item for Fitness Instructor,"I bought this book is because it is in my suggested reading list of the Pilates Instructor course. Though I haven't finished reading this book, I know that I'll carry it together with me for exercise practice, for both self practice and teaching practice. It is helpful when I want to understand the emphasis of a particular exercise."
2,the movie was better,"You know how people always say the book was better than the movie? White Oleander, Prozac Nation, Catch Me if You Can.... this is the first time that I've ever said the movie was better--- so so so much better--- than the book. It's a quick read: a little bit of text stretched out and the margins increased and the chapters are infantile. I never felt like we got that good of an understanding of anyone though, and through the whole book, it seemed like Susanna Kaysen didn't feel like she even needed to be there, and her writing makes it sound like she still doesn't think she needed to be there. I never understood what was wrong with her. Definitely watch the movie. If you must read the book, borrow it."
1,Autobiographical,This book is about the author's experience in a mental institution. It is light reading. I wish it would have been more in-depth. It would probably be a good book for a teenage audience.
2,"essay, interrupted","Perhaps this work might be titled ESSAY, INTERRUPTED. I am fascinated to imagine how this 'novel' could become a screenplay, starring one of my favorite actresses, Angelina Jolie, although I've yet to see the movie. I enjoyed the rhythm and the flow of fluid descriptive writing, but feel disappointed overall. A short novel can be powerful, but there are lots of us around who can ramble on about our adventures in the sixties. Additionally, I had trouble keeping the similar characters straight. It's a smooth essay, but let's not call this work a novel."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book - espcially since the movie previews looked good. Boy, was I disappointed. It was too short and never really had a chance to develop any meaningful story line. It started off interesting when she gets admitted and talks about some of the people at the mental hospital, but then the plot just stands still for the rest of the story. The book ends SO abruptly that you actually find yourself looking back three or four pages thinking maybe you skipped a chapter or two by accident. The author had the perfect opportunity to write an interesting and insightful story about her past experience in a mental hospital. Instead, she rushed through it and you really don't have time to care about any of the characters."
2,"A quick read, but not all that great!","I respect the fact that this is a true story, and you can't deny someone their experiences, but as a read, this book was not all that great! I'm surprised at all the 4 and 5 star reviews. At least it was a quick read, however I did find it a bit dull at times. It has been years since I read it, but ""The Bell Jar"" by Sylvia Plath (also autobiographical) was a much more intense book about a girl's ""descent into madness"". If you liked ""Girl, Interrupted"", then ""The Bell Jar"" would certainly warrant a look."
3,nothing new here,"This book was a big disappointment to me. It was well written (so what?), but any insight it provided on mental illness and mental institutions has been done before and better (I refer you to One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest for the shining example). At least it's a quick read."
1,huh???,"Personally, I don't get this book at all. I guess you can say I didn't like it. Ms. Kaysen talks at length about one topic and then in the next chapter talks about another. The actual experiences of being in the hospital were only in a few short chapters. Or maybe Ms. Kaysen just writes in a VERY unique style that I just can't get used to. Anyway I didn't enjoy this book and was pretty disappointed. Maybe the movie will turn out better."
3,I Like This,loved the movie thanks to Angelina Jolie. Which made me read the book also because it was a assingment in my school overall this book was phenomenal.
2,Went from good to bad...,"This book started out as an entertaining and enjoyable read. It was easy to build a relationship with the characters. BUT when you get to around the middle of the book, Kaysen veers off track and loses the 'story line' altogether. Could have been a great book, ended up being a bore...I wish I had only paid 1/2 the price for a book that was only 1/2 enjoyable."
4,Madness Takes Its Toll-Please Use Exact Change,"As with most movies, there is a good book lurking somewhere in its past. And ""Girl, Interrupted"", is no exception. Author and central character of this mesmerizing memoir, Susanna Kaysen, gives us a well defined exacting profile of near madness.Tweny-five years after placing herself under the watchful eyes of her ""keepers"" at Mc Lean Hospital for psychiatric treatment, Kaysen reveals her two year stay in the teenage ward back in the late 60's. A time itself of diagnosed disturbance.Richly portrayed characterzations of her fellow ""inmates"" and their doctors vividly depict everything from suicide, medications, the meaning of a crazed life, and harrowing journies to recovery.I truly enjoyed this 168 page book. Possibly more so due to the fact that I, myself, can say--""been there, done that, bought the T-shirt."" And agree, the interruption is not my life, it just may be those mannerless people around me.Thank you for your interest & comments--CDS"
3,Not Bad,"I found Susanna Kaysen's book to be entertaining and insightful, but I didn't find it as involving as I would have hoped. I wanted more to be written about the characters, their ""disorders"", and how they're coping with their supposed illnesses. Still, this book is funny, entertaining, and a good, mind-opening read."
3,introspective story of a mental patient,"Like many other people, I read this book after watching the movie with Winona Ryder.That was a big mistake, since the book hasn't have a plot. No Daisy committing suicide, no Lisa running away with Susanna, no affairs with male nurses etc,etc..However, this book deals with a young girl's quest to know what is really happenning to her during her stay at Claymore.She explores aspects of her illness as she takes the reader into the world of mental patients.Descriptions of her daily experiences at this mental Institute, her ordeal after ""losing"" an entire year of her life locked up make this book a very interesting account of what goes on in the world of psychiatry."
2,Wanted more story..not a psychology lesson,"I never saw the movie, but I can only hope it is better than the book. Maybe I just didn't know what I was getting into but I didn't not care for this book. Luckily it was short and quick.I was hoping for more of a story. I wanted to learn more about the characters, how they got to the mental institute. I wanted to learn more about Susanna's marriage and why it didn't work. I felt this was more of a book on psychology. I would have rather had the lesson through a more visual story told through the characters, thus portraying the psychological aspects of the book."
5,This book is awesome!!!,It's about a girl who trys to commits suiocide and ends up being checked into a mental hospital. She see'a what's it's really like and even trys to escape a couple of times. It's truly is a book that keeps you hanging a wanting to know what happenes next. I thought that it was good because it tells what real teenagers go through. It doesn't sugarcoat it at all it just gives you the cold hard facts. It gives you the innermost thoughts of this girl and shows that teens don't just have soap opera lives but the have real troubles.
1,That was then this is now,"This book I didn't think was any good. There really wasn't a plot. The book just went on and on. Basically the book is just about a kid who goes out on dates, and gets in gang fights. It's boring. But it is an interesting book. When you pick it up you want to read all of it. I didn't like the book because. It was boring. Didn't have a good plot if it even had a plot. The only Major event happens at the end of the story. It constantly skipped around. It was hard to understand. The auther S.E. Hinton added in things that didn't need to be put in the book. The story has nothing to do with the end or the climax. It's like the climax just was picked out of a hat. Those are the main reasons why I don't like this book."
4,Rachel's Review,"Girl, Interrupted, by Susanna Kaysen, is a story of true intensity. After a session with a phychiatrist, 16 year old Susanna Kaysen is diagonosed with Borderline Personality disorder, and is immeadiantly sent to MCclean Hospital.Susanna is to spend the next two years in the MCclean Mental Instution for teenage girls. While living in the Instution, Susanna goes through many horrific experiences, and meets the kind of people that you could only imagine in your nightmares. Susanna eventually makes friends with a tempermental patient who has a reputation of being the ""boss"" of their ward.But in time, Susanna realizes that a friend in a mental instution is very different from a friend in conatct with the outside world.Explore the world that Susanna beholds. Inspect the very defination of sanity, and view the world from the eyes of a remarkable teenage girl with vivid concepts of every day issues that face our lives."
2,Dissatisfied,"I had a lot of hope for this book but I was disappointed by the lack of emotion for the main character. My biggest problem with the book is that it lacked any depth, it was far too scattered. For example, the main character meets her future husband, gets a marriage proposal, gets married and divorced all in one chapter with no explanation as to what happened? We don't even know the man's name or more imporantly how her illness affected this important relationship. I was left wanting more explantion time and time again throughout the book. The characters were not fully developed and I felt no connection to Susanna. The clinical explanations of mental illness were all of a sudden thrown in between chapters and did not not relate to what was previously written. I'm not sure if I'll see the movie now, but it might be interesting how they turn such disjointed book into a film."
4,"Great Book, a tad confusing","I LOVED this book, but I found some words and depictions very confusing, and how the stories jumped around. But well written, very easy to read, with some exceptions, and thought provoking!"
3,Amusing.,"At less than 200 pages with medium-sized font, I was able to finish this book in the course of a school day. I was entertained by most, which Kaysen sought to do, although the sections that were supposed to make you think somehow seemed obvious to me -- 'well, yes, that's not right, that's not ethical, no surprises here.' An occasional insightful remark about mental illness is made, but I see nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary about 'Girl.'When I finished 'Girl' I saw it more as a piece of dark humor -- this is not a funny topic on its face, although Kaysen manages to make us helpless to laugh at some of the aspects of it and the scenarios it can force one into. She does not take herself too seriously, which I was grateful for, and isn't a crusader -- she simply seeks to show you what her interruption with mental illness was like, and she succeeds.Check it out from the library."
3,Choppy/Not Much Story Here,"The book started out telling a sad & funny story but somewhere in the middle lost it & went down hill from there. It seemed like the author forgot she was writting a novel & got lost in her own thoughts. The 2nd half of the book is non-sense and her evaluating her diagnosis years later. More of a reporting than a novel. For once, the movie will be better - it has to be! : )"
5,macaroni,The screen was perfect. I did return it because I hadn't properly measured the space that I needed it for. Otherwise it would have been exactly what I wanted.
5,Cream of the crop classic,I read this book over 30 years ago and it's effect has never left my memory. It is a treasure that refuses to be forgotten and will stay with you forever. I am an avid reader and there are few books that take the lead like this one did.
4,The King's General,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this but I was more than pleasantly surprised. Du Maurier brings the past vividly to life and spins a rather downbeat tale of those caught in terrible times. This is not a depressing read however, instead a more honest, believable one. Du Maurier also has a fine heroine in Hope, a woman who more than most has to use her brains to survive. Recommended."
2,not my favorite D DuM,this book to me was too drysome parts were good but not great and it just seemed to drag for meto me there was no atmosphere as there is in her other books
2,This book is really only a long introduction to its sequel.,"This book is incomplete and unsatisfying. Although I love Pohl's stories, I felt like I had wasted my time with this book. There is no resolution. No conclusion. It just stops. I though that maybe my copy was defective and missing a few pages. That said, it is an okay story. But hardly worth the hard cover price. You could really skip it and go directly to the much better ""real"" book, ""The Far Shore Of Time""."
2,Shallow and unimaginative start of series.,"Pohl is a fine and talented author, but in Siege of Eternity he ignores his experience and squashes his talent. The writing is simplistic, but with too much sex and violence for this to be a childrens book. The characters are shallow and undeveloped. Despite the action and sex, the book is a bore. Worse yet, when you finish (and I am not giving anything away), *nothing* is resolved! Turns out you wasted all this time on an obvious introduction to a serial. If you want to enjoy some good Frederik Pohl, don't read this book."
1,Very little resistance in this circle,"I bought this circle because of the lower price. It came in today and I did a workout with it. I am used to the pilates ""fitnesscircle"" (Stott) from the gym. These are a tough resistance that make your workout extra hard and in return gain you more strength and muscle. As soon as I put this circle between my thighs, it was very easy to push my legs together (and that shouldn't be the case). In my opinion, with this, you get what you pay for. I returned this product today."
3,Borland's long-lost novel in print at last!,"Actress Borland co-starred with Bela Lugosi in 1935's THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, D: Tod Browing). She first met Lugosi after seeing him onstage in DRACULA: THE VAMPIRE PLAY. It inspired her to write COUNTESS DRACULA, a sequel ore to the play than to Stoker's novel. She showed it to Lugosi, and they became friends. Now, just before Borland's death, the book was published. Yes, it was an amateurish effort, not terribly good. However, it has a unique place in both film history and horror literature, and it belongs in every true vampire fan's collection."
3,Good but not perfect,"This bag is good for traveling with toiletries and such, but the first time I filled one of the clear zipper compartments with inexpensive jewelry, the jewelry poked tiny holes in the ""fabric"" which is pretty much the same fabric as used in windbreaker jackets. I will probably keep using this for travel, but not for jewelry."
4,Laugh Out Loud,"Although this book began to lose it's zest in the last few pages, and the ending was rather odd, it still generated numerous laugh out loud moments.The plot and characters were entertaining and it was easy to visualize what famous actress could deliver these lines and make this story a great movie.Even though this was not one of the best Claire Malloy Mysteries, I believe you will still enjoy the it."
1,pathetic,"this album is horrible. do not buy this album. people will probably buy this album simply because the lead singer used to be a porn director. but take my word for it, dont buy this. its like a nu-metal/industrial train wreck. the singer also claims that he follows a ""left hand"" religion and that he has two sides to himself: Matt Zane and Lord Nexus. Hahahaha. Come on, he sounds like a Power ranger."
1,Please...,"Why must we endure bigoted remarks like the patronizing anti-religion rambling of Mr. Lee? Stick to the review. PS, Violence lurks in every human heart, which is why supposedly good people do bad things so often. And why atheist left-wing radicals killed more people this century than religious wars ever have. Look it up!"
5,Another essential for the results-oriented marketer,"Personally, I like lists. And this books gives you tons of lists to make sure that your marketing pieces are as good as they can be. Think of this book as an insurance policy. Well done, Denny."
2,Mediocre and bland,"The book was a dissapointment. A long list of ""bumper sticker"" phrases is not my cup of tea. I guess some people like to read common sense advice over and over and over. Not me. Thanks,"
3,Darkel - Darkel,"Well, even as Air moved away from 70s psychedelic rock after _10,000 Hz Legend_, Jean-Benot Dunckel couldn't abandon that part of him entirely, so it reappears under his solo moniker, Darkel. His self-titled debut is cheery enough, a little slice of Gallic pop. ""At the End of the Sky"" sounds like something from the Summer of Love, and even if you can't quite understand the lyrics of ""TV Destroy,"" you can appreciate the breathy percussion and rocking propulsiveness. There seems to be a strain of American blues in the lyrics, with an emphasis on spiritual religiousity (""Some Men,"" ""Pearl"") that sometimes feels at odds with the French vibe Dunckel is going for. But ""Earth"" serves as a counterpart to these tracks, with its more funk-oriented rhythm and its single earth-friendly lyric. And on the final track, ""Bathroom Spirit,"" a bit of the Air aesthetic returns. This is a pleasant album -- not quite up there with the best of Air, but not quite as annoying as _10,000 Hz Legend_, either."
1,A Waste Of Time,"I rented this yesterday, for the sole fact it's an Al Pacino movie. Once I brought it home, I came on the net, on Amazon, and decided to see what everyone's thoughts on this movie were. Everyone had basically the same response, but I thought maybe I'd enjoy it, even though a lot of people didn't. After watching it, my thoughts turned out to be the same.Pacino was good, as he always is. I thought Richard Schiff was also good, even though he wasn't in it much. But the rest was garbage. The movie was slow, the plot was terrible. Thank god it was only 1 hr. 40mins.Avoid this film. The only reason it gets one star is because Pacino was good in it."
3,very informative-,"I bought this textbook for a class I had to take and can say that it is very informative, but a little dry."
3,It kind of works...,"I used it on my tires and I used a lot. The next day, I saw that the tires did shine, but it was a patchy shine... You need multiple applications to get the desired effect, which means you have to buy another bottle that much sooner."
1,Bottle was not closed tight,so it was leaking out. Although it was in a plastic bag it managed to soak an additional item which was shipped together with the tire shine. No idea who's responsible to make sure liquid products are closed tight but whoever packed it did not care a bit. Huge mess and I trashed it on arrival.
4,Cute!,"Gene and Frank go on their first sailor-suited adventure, and meet tons of fun songs, Kathryn Grayson, and her absolutely adorable little nephew, Dean Stockwell. (There's a scene where Gene, Frank, and Dean all smile at the same time - overload on cuteness!) BUT - this disc is not perfect. The sound is good, but not pristine, and it becomes clear (no pun intended) that Anchors Aweigh's soundtrack has not been given the professional cleanup that An American in Paris or Singin' in the Rain have received. Again, the sound isn't BAD, and for us fans who know how little-known this flick is, it's a treat to even have the songs on CD, but don't expect too much from the quality. One more thing: The songs have the background effects (talking from the stars, taps, etc.) still there. Decide for yourself whether or not you like them, because some do, and some don't. Bottom line: Listen to the samples here and decide for yourself."
1,Chinese sizing?,"Very disappointed in this product! (Amazon, you're still great). The sizing is ridiculous. They run at least one full size small and who makes clothing anymore that when you toss the brand new shirt into the dryer on fluff to knock the wrinkles out it comes out with the sleeves a full three inches shorter than they went in? If you have very short arms and buy a size larger than you really wear you will love this product. Nuff said."
1,"Size is crazy small, I'm a big dude I bought a big size. It was like I had bought a size medium.","This shirt runs wicked small, it was a waste of money. I ended up giving it away. Stay away from this shirt."
3,good shoe for the price,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
4,it is comfortable but the color,"The shoe was very good,comfortable and style . But it would be better if it was 14W wih color white/black. In the picture it appeares brighter, but we got darker."
5,Cook's Illustrated Is Right: A Great Pan At Great Price,"OK, so Cook's Illustrated rated this pan the best bargain nonstick pan and every one stampeded to get one. But, Cook's Illustrated is right: this is a great pan. How long will the nonstick coating last? Don't know, don't care. At $25 you can buy four or five of these for what an All Clad pan would cost, get years of use from each one, and probably never get to the fifth one as a replacement, assuming you live that long. As for it being termed a ""saute pan"", you can ""saute"" in anything, even a sauce pan, so there's no such thing as a pan just for saute, and many cooks feel the skillet type pan is better anyway. The main advantage of a saute pan is that, because of its straight sides, you get the maximum footprint of the pan as cooking surface. In any case, this pan is very good quality and a great value."
4,wonderful pan but balance problem causes frustration,"This pan is a wonderful size and cooking surface for an all purpose skillet and saute. It has a flaw, however, which is makes it slightly frustrating to use. The handle has not been balanced correctly and the pan tips towards the handle when on an electric burner. This causes the contents to run to one side and I've had to actually prop up the handle to level the pan. Unfortunately, I have an all electric kitchen and this is an ongoing problem. I do not know if the pan would be similarly unbalanced if on a gas burner. I have made some creative choices in propping up the handle, even resorting to sticking it through the handle of a coffee mug on the counter next to the stove. Apart from this challenge to my ingenuity, the pan is great."
4,Glass Cover Not Included,"Like other users I purchased this pan as advised by Cooks Illustrated and so far I am loving it. I am only giving 4 stars because the second 'product description' on this page is incorrect in listing the glass cover as part of the product. You only get the pan, but it sure is great!"
5,Five stars. Must read for all intercultural couples,"This is a must read book for all inter-cultural and inter-racial couples considering getting married, or those that are already married.The book is easy to read while still being full of substance. I believe it will help strengthen the relationships of those that are already married, and will give food for thought for those who are thinking of marriage."
3,could be better,"This wax goes on easy and come off easy. Great shine but its durabilty is short. I wash and wax my car every saturday and water does not bead up after 1 week.The wax is not very thick,a quarter sized amount in the center of the pad did not cover the same area as Blacks Magic Wax."
1,Don't Buy Unless You Need To,"One of the worst written math books I've ever seen. You have no idea if some theorem or lemma is important or not, because the only way you can distinguish those are bold typeface and their numbers (typically only their numbers). The proofs are also very economically written. Every sentence in the proofs might be equivalent to 3-4 sentences. Also he doesn't like to use enter key often. So, sometimes I feel like I'm reading a novel. Very long paragraphs without brakes. He omits a lot of things in the book. Typically for the limits you don't have any n -> \infty or he always talks about limits of sequences of random variables but doesn't make it very explicit what he actually means is a point-wise convergence of functions.So, unnecessarily economically written book and you might spend hours just to understand a step in his proofs, because he omits maybe 2-3 inbetween steps assuming that you're gonna get it. Don't buy unless you really need to."
1,Avoid it unless it is required in your class,"One of the worst textbooks that I have ever owned. Nothing is clear. Here are some examples.""If X and Y are independent and f and g are measurable functions, show that f(X) and g(Y) are independent.""Are X and Y random variables, or events? What are the domain of f and g? What measurable?""Find all the joint distributions...(so on, so on.)""Joint distribution is never defined in this book. It is not even in the index.One can most likely figure out by context, but that is not the point. It is a textbook. It must teach us something, and therefore, it has to make every single little thing as clear as it can. I would recommend you to stay away from this textbook, if you are new to the probability theory. If you are required to purchase this book, I would suggest you to have another reference. I think even some of the analysis books do the better job of explaining the probability measure than this one."
3,"Soft plastic, gouges easily and warps in dishwasher","As a long-time fan of all things Oxo, I must say I'm pretty disappointed with this product. The plastic is very soft. What does this mean? Well, for anyone who knows their way around a kitchen will tell you, it means this: If you have sharp knives like my Victorinox Forschner and Global chef knives you will easily slice gouges into the plastic with no effort at all. Slicing tomatoes (which means very little pressure on the blade) caused deep gouges that can easily trap bacteria.Soft plastic also means that when you wash it in the dishwasher with the heating element for the water and heated dryer turned off, it will still warp.Pros? The rubber coated exterior edge and rubber nub feet work really well by holding the board in place. Out of wood, plastic, glass (ugh!) and acrylic, acrylic has been my favorite cutting surface and I will get another one to replace this one ASAP."
1,Dinged up as bad as my old cutting boards,"I love OXO stuff, but these cutting boards are just bad. They lasted worse than the cheapo ones I bought at Kroger a couple years ago. They are already very scratched and dinged up after just a month of use."
3,Book fails to make the connection,"I picked up a copy of ""the living landscape"" at the local library thinking I was on to something interesting. Instead, I found the book to be a rehash of old, simple ideas under the cloak of a ""sexy"", progressive title. I am a practicing environmental planner and must admit that I was even fooled by the picture on the cover--How in the world is a linear mono-cultural hedgerow of trees that line an walkway even remotely a just symbol of ""ecological planning""? The picture seems to satisfy the landscape architect's need to have order-- Ecology is anything but linear or orderly.I must be fair. The book is well writen and offers students in environmental planning a good introduction to landscape planning with some environmenatl emphasis. However, in my opinion, I don't believe that the book does justice or furthers the progressive concept of ""ecological"" planning, as defined by the likes of the late Ian McHarg."
4,A lot of fun and a great learning experience,"Okay, I admit my first thought when I heard about this project was that we had another version of Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood."" However, on hearing the tracks, I was extremely impressed. The arrangements are very tastefully done and the performances are first rate. This is a great entry-level disc into the world of ""traditional"" jazz and ideal for people who want to learn what it's all about. Kudos to Alex on taking a chance and pulling it off so well."
1,False ads,"If you loved the movie like I did, do not buy the CD. It is advertised as an Original Motion Picture Soundtrack but is absolutely nothing like the movie. Very disappointed."
3,ALABAMA NOT SWEET ENOUGH,"Watching the movie, you get to hear the original Sweet Home Alabama song throughout. On the recording of the movie, they have another artist singing the song which was a big disappointment. The other songs are Ok but it would have been perfect with original."
1,Crap!!!!!!1,This is the worst CD I have ever heard. Don't waste your time or money buying this garbage....
3,You do not know what you may get....,I have a little boy and bought these. Little Mermaid is what we recieved....not cool but not the end of the world. Be wary of this when ordering.
5,Great Buy,"i couldn't find these in the store yet (january in michigan) and we were getting ready to go on vacation, so i'm glad i found them!! great product!!"
2,Amazon description inaccurate,"The item is described by Amazon as suitable ""for global travel and worldwide usage"". It is not, as further adaptor plug (not included) is required to use this item in several locations, including the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Nigeria, the Seychelles, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Which rather defeats the object of buying it for 'worldwide usage'."
2,The main author showes his true colors,"I know about this incident, Graf tries to defend his actions, but confirms how wrong he was, he does not seem to yet understand that he messed up and he brought his co-author down with him. I think the body of the book was ok, author Schnable does a very good job, you will feel bad for him and understand why Graf is out in the cold, his administraitive skills seemed to be limited you can tell by his Medina PD structure, all but one officer has a high rank? This book is bias toward the tax protestor/killers he writes about. Granted the marshals made a big error and it cost them, as Graf stood by not helping, now you learn about how he lives with that. Graf tries to blame everone but himself. It is very rough and very strange book, but if you are interested in this subject read it. Bitter Harvest is a must read for the real story."
2,Music is good...but half it is missing!!!,"Some of these old Bond sountrack albums are the most dissapointing things. Like Moonraker and The Spy who Loved me, half of the score for Diamonds are Forever is left off the CD. And I'm not talking, a bit here, a bit there. We're talking about all the music that appeared in the first half of the film. Where the hell is the great underscore for the entire pre-title sequence, or the fight in the elevator with Peter Franks, or the theme used to introduce Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, or Bond's journey to Holland? How about re-issuing all the Bond soundtracks (like RYKO's The Living Daylights CD) with all the music on it, from the opening ""gun barrel"" theme to the very last credit. Hell I'd be happy even if they stuck United Artists fanfare on the CD!!! Just something to make it seem complete."
3,Suffers from the translation !,"This book was evidently written in French and translated to English. Mr. Verlinden needed to hire better translators and proof readers for this book. There are numerous misspelled words, not just typos! The phrase usage AND misspellings makes this one hard to follow, especially for young readers. The information offered is excellent but almost not worth the hassle. Beginners in the plastics modeling world might be discouraged by the difficulty of the text. As he says in this book, ""For the occasional modeller (misspelled: should be modeler) it is too much of an investment."" He is referring to piles of magazines and books. Buyers of this book should probably visually scan through this one before purchasing to see if it is worth the seemingly inflated purchase price."
1,Poorly made product,"I purchased the lock expecting it not to be perfect, but decent. When I received it, it was difficult to install because the backset that goes into the doorframe was put together improperly and would not open when the handle was turned (I have installed locks before so I do have experience). I had to disassemble the lock backset and fix the problem before I could even install the unit.After it was installed, the lock was extremely unreliable when it came to programming and only functioned as it should 25% of the time. The fingerprint reads were good when it worked, but after three days of use the unit died for no apparent reason. I checked the batteries and everything was fine.Don't purchase this lock and make the same mistake I did. It was a complete waste of money and another example of poorly made Chinese junk. Spend a little more and get something from a different manufacture."
1,Listing is wrong,This item is listed to fit a Mercedes Benz SL600 1995. Which is wrong.The right belt has eight ridges and is wider.
1,Not a credible book!,"It has become obvious to me and perhaps anyone who has read this book that the author ""may be"" behind a few of her own five star ratings here! I just noticed the exact same style of writing and same word selection in both the book and the positive reviews. I wondered why a book reviewer would ever defend a book by attacking another reviewer point by point and have the exact same tone found IN the book???? I also noticed the signature words ""A READER"" is the exact same signature used by both Goodman and Bennings on the same day!!!? Coincidence? OR Did the same person use two different alias names! I hope the writer was not behind this, this is very embarrasing.Another thing that caught my attention was the many uses in the book of the word ""WITHIN"" and why would any reviewer say the book is ""COMPLETE"" unless they wrote it and feel it is complete? Positive reviews? hummm..."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was truely a big waste of time and money. Two things I don't like to waste. Did not like anything about this book. In fact I could not read the entire thing, it put me to sleep early on. One can easily see that this book was written with no reguard to the truth. Since Lulu Press is a ""vanity press"", it also leads me to believe that no real publisher wanted to touch this type of cult -like-book. Save your money, buy something else."
1,Fake prophecy!,"The writer of this book spared no shame in including in her book details concerning the 911 disaster and is profiting from people's deaths and misery! This is a gross and sad treatment of our nation's worst disaster and to profit a dime from selling books using the unfortunate who died is unheard of! A FAKE prophet predicts whats already been written in the newspapers- no prophesy here! It sickened me, I know some who died and was offended.Don't buy this book! I wish I could take away this single star but I can't !"
1,Review the book NOT the reviewers!,G. Bennings review reads more like a personal attack on a reviewer of the book rather than a book review. Wow. I actually found Fran's review more useful then the rest. I agree with Fran and I don't want anyone in my family reading this book either. It does mislead people to think that they don't need a church family which to me is very important. I tried to read the entire book but felt uncomfortable as I read it and could not finish it. Sorry.
2,So So,"The item smells great and my dog love to chew them. It did remove most of the tarter from his teeth, but it gave him diarrhea."
4,Good story,"I thought the story was well done and loved the characters, but the going off on tangents regarding every detail of the building was a little more than I needed."
1,"Entertaining, but not well researched","The material in this book is based on many secondary sources and not fully researched as pointed out by one of the authors. In a discussion group A. Nofi pointed out that it was totally unlikely any German aircraft flew the Atlantic in preparation to bomb New York. Yet some one pointed out that this is one of the ""dirty secrets"" in his book after Mr. Nofi critisized other historians for using this reference. His response to why his book had errors like this on June 29, 1999 was: ""That was then. This is now. Since then we've dug a mite deeper. If we do a second edition, we'll insert ""claimed"" as appropriate."" --A. Nofi. There are other little tidbits in this book based on similar sloopy research. The book is interesting, but as Mr. Nofi has pointed out - unreliable! Still a nice gift for the buff."
1,Misleading Wine Guide for Very Few,"Andrea Immer's pocket size book reads like Madison Avenue advertising copy. Yes, there are some wines that do not get stellar reviews, but the majority of them seem to be copied straight from a winery's marketing mailer. Is she really objective? Word has it that many of the wines she writes about are owned by companies that have paid her to speak. While her writing is breezy and cute (kind of like a self-confident, cocky college sorority girl with brains and little substance), it is not useful to true wine lovers."
5,Excellent Wine Book,"What's good about this book is that a lot of the wines in it are in stores so you can compare the book to what you are about to purchase. It's great that the book is narrowed down to only 400 of the best selling wines in the U.S. I LOVED the categories for best wines for pizza, picnics and other everyday dining experiences. This book is indispensable for anyone who likes to buy good wine for less than fifteen dollars a bottle."
1,"Good book, no discounts","First off this book seems to be excellent for the topic at hand. However I am giving it 1 star since the publisher has put a restriction on it that it can only sell for the full book price. Retailers are not allowed to sell this book for less than the publisher price of $69.99How do I know this? I tried to purchase it in a Barnes and Noble and was told that the Publisher has put a restriction on retailers for this title.Therefore buying it at Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Bookpool or anywhere else will not get you a discount.Instead it will have to be read in a Barnes and Noble store over coffee.Simply because of the publisher not allowing the price to flex I am giving this book a rating of 1 star.Publishers please pay attention and remove this restriction."
5,i luv the vance 32 album,Looking for an EchoI lived on the same block as kenny in belle harbor rockaway and i babysat for his 2 sons and i played this album over and over !
4,"Wicked Rhymes, So So beats","Lyically, Copywrite is capable of holding his own with other MCs. His lyrics are funny and downright cutthroat, but unfortunately, the beats on a collective basis are unimpressive. ""Fire It Up"", ""Three Words"", ""Badabing"" and ""Tower of Babble"" are definitely the strongest tracks, with wicked lyrics and some badass beats."
5,Come on: Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin,This movie is a classic. I grew up with it and can quote most of the script.Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?
3,Pretty Good,"I read this book after Caldwell's excellent ""Hayek's Challenge"". I don't normally read biographies, but that was so good I hunted around for related material (and found this).Unfortunately, this suffers in comparison. Caldwell is much better at signposting and structuring the argument. In contrast, Hacohen jumps around, often covering the same period in different contexts. And his hand is too heavy - the authorial opinions are often forced (or even plain odd - what on earth does he have against Popper's wife?).Still, his intentions are generally honourable (not always; there's a blind spot as far as Zionism goes) and the final chapter, which places Popper's thought within the current(ish) left-wing context, is interesting."
2,Poor design,"Constantly plugs up and stops flowing. When it is flowing, it throws the fertilizer about 3 feet all on one side. The adjustments make no difference. I verified that the impeller is rotating correctly. Great quality materials and design might look good on paper but with no internal agitator and the high RPM impeller, you could do better by just throwing fertilizer by hand through a fan. It might work fine for sand or seeds but not fertilizer."
1,Grossly overpriced for a cast iron dutch oven!,"This product costs 5 times more than the comparable Lodge product, which is made in USA. You are paying for the name, oo la la. This is a very nice pot, but is is worth 5 times the price? Your call.Check out the Lodge here:Lodge Color 6-Quart Dutch Oven, Island Spice RedFrankly I don't like enameled cast iron anyway. The reason is if you drop it (and you will) the enamel chips, then the cast iron rusts and it looks awful. If you overheat it the enamel will craze. Plain old bare cast iron for me, please. It cooks just as well, even though it looks primitive. If you absolutely must have enameled ware for appearance, be aware that it should be handled like glass, don't drop, don't thermal shock it, don't overheat it. Eventually you will be eating that enamel, hope it's not toxic."
4,Do not entry,"So reads a sign in one of the scenes in this film. The rest of the film is equally messed-up. This movie pretty much consists of several loosely- related (and I'm being generous here) scenes of mayhem and murder. But they are oh so enjoyable scenes. The special fx, even when or perhaps even especially when poor, are a riot. Though the plot has more holes in it than the wall of a San Francisco bathhouse there was still enough there to sort of be able to tell what was going on. As long as you don't expect any coherent explanations for anything that happens this film should be a pleaser."
4,THE BEYOND:CLASSIC FULCI ESCAPISM!LITERALLY!,"An absolute feast of giallo mayhem,culminating in probably one of the most chilling finales ever offered to celluloid. De Rossi's effects are excellent for their time,and great fun to watch now(OH...THOSE SPIDERS!!).Any REAL horror buff should NOT be without this disc in their collection."
2,"""Beyond"" doesn't live up to its reputation.","""The Beyond"" is certainly an infamous movie, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to its notoriety. It's crime: the movie is BORING. The shocker gore scenes are laughable (much agreement to the earlier critic who asked about the pipe-cleaner tarantulas. No doubt!), the zombies pretty damned ridiculous, and the pacing sluggish. There were some highlights, however, including the dialogue ... priceless! ""I've lived in New York all of my life, and if there's one thing I know, there's no such thing as ghosts."" Oh my god! Another highlight: the red-haired, pig-tailed girl getting her head blown off. Impressive. However, I would recommend Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" before this over-rated bag of hooey."
2,let it stay in the 80's,"The BeyondWhen i heard it was related to The Gates of Hell, I ordered it instantly. The Gates of Hell was scary for the time it came out. I ranked it in my top 10 scariest movies of all times. But The Beyond didn't have that same feel. Maybe because it has been 25 years since i've seen The Gates of Hell, special effects were more advanced for the 80s compared to the 70s. But watching a movie in 2010 from the 1980's you really zoom in on the bad effects."
3,Not too impressive,"Having enjoyed 'Zombie' and read quite a bit about Lucio Fulci that impressed me, I went into this one with pretty high expectations. I won't say I was flat-out disapointed, but the film kind of dissolves towards the end, with the story being kicked to the side in exchange for Fulci's trademark gore. And the ending? Bah.That being said, the film is not bad, but not great by any stretch of the imagination. Good special effects for the most part, and I loved the windup spiders, just nothing really special here."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I don't know why people are saying this film is fantastic. It is complete rubbish, unless you think an eyeball piercing scene is worth 20 pounds sterling. For a start the FX are poor: the spiders look like pipe cleaners (I laughed out loud when I saw them), the zombies AREN'T day of the dead quality (hardly any gore) and the whole plot is just rubbish with super-bad acting. IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A FILM ALONG THE LINE OF THE ROMERO ""DEAD"" MOVIES, YOU WILL BE SORELY DISAPPOINTED. I gave this movie away a week after I bought it, yes it is that bad."
2,Night of Hell,"Fulci's so called ""masterpiece"" is a trying piece of moviemaking that is utterly predictable and slow. The boring cycle starts out with a lady inherting some old hotel and attempting to fix it up but along the way some workers accidentally open a ""gate of hell"" and everyone winds up dead. The only good thing about this film is the ending which features a strange 70's soundtrack, matte backdrop of hell and a bizarre expression on the characters faces, reminscient of Dario Argento's films, other than that, this is a waste of time."
4,Great book for diehard fans,If you are a fan of the Sox and lived and died with them during the past 45 years you will enjoy this book. The pictures alone make this book worth the price. It has rekindled several memories of my visits to Comiskey park. The writing does look un-edited and has some rough spots. Overall this book is a great keepsake for Sox fans.
3,one side of the correspondence,"letters are communications back and forth that develop ideas and the relationship. this book only offers one side of the communication. that's a problem for me. it means that everything here is out of context.also i think this is a sampling of even Pio's letters. too much has been deleted.the collected letters of Therese of Lisieux come to 2 volumes, hundreds of pages. it offers the communication to and from her. this is what must be done with Padre Pio's letters. i hope it happens."
3,A strong departure for Mapfumo,"Thomas Mapfumo and the Blacks Unlimited works with Wadada Leo Smith and N'Da Kulture on DREAMS AND SECRETS: a strong departure for Mapfumo who shares musical ideas, songwriting credit and band members with another musician/writer: and what a contrast in styles!N'Da Kulture is a band very much influenced by the sonic explorations and experimentation of jazz and rock groups of the late 1960s.For regular Mapfumo fans, their music can be quite jarring and much jazzier than The Blacks Unlimited.Some tracks are completely dominated by Wadada Leo Smith and his group; others by Mapfumo - but with the musicians of N'Da Kulture adding extra color to the patented Blacks Unlimited sound.These later tunes turned out to be our favorites."
3,A Ring,"Looks slightly lesser quality than the picture, but it does what it was meant to. I'm fine with my purchase."
3,Complicated imo,It has a lot of information but for me it is WAY to technical. I guess these are things you need to know but I don't feel it is explained in a very easy to digest sort of way. I don't understand the theory and this book does not seem to be helping me much. Maybe I need something more basic that explains music theory a little better and in a more basic sort of way...This book is not for someone that is starting out in music theory. I have played guitar for many years but never spent any time learning anything past tabs. This book is not the next step up from tabs... i feel I am trying to jump a huge gab in my understanding of music theory.I gave it 3 stars because I guess it must be helpful for people that are at that stage and have some basic understanding of music theory prior to buying this. It just is not for me.
1,a pile of mess,"The basic format of this book is:Chord Sequence I IV V: C F G'over you', 'spanish stroll'........but there is neither staff nor tab of the songs.and even worse, there are always suddenly pages of chords without any context.Maybe the author should read ""How to teach students by books"""
2,Not Well Written,"Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews for this book. Maybe it's because the book is so slickly packaged and colorful. Do not expect to get much out of this book, unless you are well versed in music theory. You'll have to figure the theory out for yourself. Not that Rooksby doesn't try. Rooksby attempts to explain the theory behind chords and their use, but the explanations are so abbreviated that a newcomer will never figure out what he's talking about. Another problem;he often introduces important concepts not explained until later chapters, if at all. On the positive, you will learn about different sequences of chords and what songs use them. There is good information here, but just poorly explained. I suggest The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory and The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Composition, both by Michael Miller be used in CONJUNCTION with Rooksby's book."
4,Very nice,This is a large truck almost a foot long. I got these for my nephews and sons for Christmas. My nephews loved them. My sons barely paid attention to them. Guess it all depends on the kid. This does make a lot of noise so if it's a gift open the box when no kids are around. :)
3,Only OK,"I have to admit I was disapointed in this book. It was a dry read with little that can not be found elsewhere. I found myself skipping over sections pertaining to mind numbing details about late 60's and early 70's concert promotion. I also wanted to know more about the dead in the 80's and 90's. That said my biggest problem with this book was that it did not dive into the core of what the dead really was: a mystical phenomenon. What the dead did was amazing and seemingly otherworldly and impossible. I would have really liked have gotten a more inside view of the band members take on this matter. I know it is briefly touched on in the book, but this is the core of what the dead was, and it deserves a thorough treatment. In my mind it is like a bio of bill clinton that only spends about 1/2 a chapter on his presidency."
3,Time warped and uneven but still fascinating,"One one hand it makes perfect sense to have the band's publicist write its biography because he will be privy to lots of cool inside info. On the other hand having someone who worked for the band as its publicist almost certainly guarantees a lack of balance and impartiality. Both of these things are true about A Long Strange Trip. There is also a strange kind of time compression in which the very earliest days of the band and Jerry are dwelled upon at length , even though this predates McNally's personal experience. In contrast, the last 15 or 20 years of the band with which McNally had the most personal knowledge are crammed into a small fraction of the book, and the story of the decline and fall of Jerry is almost not discussed. But this is still by far the best biography of the band and is full of cool anecdotes and, I think, gives a pretty good picture of what the boys were after when the whole thing began in the mid 1960s."
2,Purported Expert Doesn't Care Enough to Correct Mistakes,"I'm not knocking this entire book; there's a lot of good info in here. What bothers me is that the supposed 'gospel' and 'official' price guide failed to accurately describe the availability of a certain Beatles Collection - BC 13 - Limited Edition box set released in the United States during the Christmas Holiday /December 1978.As the facts still stand, this ""retail release"" was available to the general public, in stark contrast to Perry's statement of being only available to Capitol Record executives and industry affiliates. This type of sloppy journalism results in the creation of false perceptions in the market place..."
5,Water is already a big problem,"We can know that water problem is not lying in the future but now. Especially Dead Sea basin is the source of armed conflicts over years. The Aral Sea problem shows no sighn to recover.As previous reviewer said, this books let you blue. But it's necessary to think over the water management problem for our future.Water is the main issue of our security in 21st century."
3,The wrong book!,"The book was in good condition. It took it little longer than I expected to receive it so it was an even bigger upset to realize that it was the wrong book, but I was able to purchase the correct book the same day."
5,Hip Hop Abs,"Very good DVD....I have reviewed it (since I love to dance, the moves seem really easy to perform), but I haven't really used it yet. I am going to use it in the future as I have just recently started back working out."
3,Fun but need more...,Although this workout is fun to do I don't feel like it is much of a workout. I went from this to P90X and now that is a workout.
4,Good workout DVD!,"I like this DVD and recommend BUY but would not not pay full retail price for it, which is overpriced. I bought it used in good condition and it worked for me.Shaun T gives good instruction, has good sense of humor and face appeal. The workout is slow to moderate pace, has good control movements and easy to follow. I also like the DVD shows title of each move and a clock counting down. Overall, it's a good product."
4,great workout,"This DVD is a great workout for beginners. The music is upbeat, the steps are not too difficult to follow. The DVD actually has 4 workouts on it, I've only been using 1 so far. It has a option that allows you to pump the music up louder through the DVD, which means you hear less of Shawn T's talking once you've gotten used to the workout and no longer need prompting. I don't find this particularly useful, but its there. The DVD has a bar across the bottom of the screen during the workout so that you know how much total time is left, and how much time is left in the section you're in. This is a great feature I wish other workouts had. Overall this is a pretty good workout - if you're a gym rat I think it'll be too easy for you. But if you're not, this is a great place to start."
4,Hip hop abs. great for quick at home workout.,I recently purchased the Hip Hop Abs. DVD from Amazon to get it for less money. I was happy that I purchased it. Although the DVD case was completely shattered in pieces the two DVD's were fine and I enjoy the workout. I was surprised on how intense the core workout is. I have been a Jazzerciser since 1982 and I am challenged by this tape as well.
5,The guy is cheesy but...,"The exercises work great as long as you are willing to commit to it, and eat right. The guy who hosts the DVDs is really cheesy and his rap makes me laugh. I usually turn the volume down all the way on the TV and put on my own music (rap or hip hop), because if I don't I laugh too hard to exercise. As for the dance it is great exercise and fun too. This is the funnest exercise DVD I have owned."
5,Must have!,"I've tried different exercise videos that say they're for ""beginners""...Not!!! My daughter has used Hip Hop Abs and told me they were ""do-able"". She's down to a size 2 (mother of 3) and I'll never get there but these exercises are fun and I can do them everyday and enjoy them! They're fun and motivational."
2,not great,I paid over 100 dollars for hip hop abs thinking it was going to be great. After getting the package i gave it a shot and its nothing great. I could have went to the library and just rented a video for free. Three of the videos are only around 25 min long and 1 of them is around 5 min long.You could have really fit all the dvd's on one dvd they put them on 4 just so you feel that you are getting more DONT BE FOOLED. To be honest with you its not really worth all the money that you pay. Really do you need to pay all that money for his videos when you can go rent a abs video at the library for free. Im not telling you if you should or should not buy his video's im just letting you know what you are getting for all the money you are spending.---NOTHING REALLY
4,Hip Hop Fun 'n Fitness,"Shaun T's Hip Hop Abs is a lot of fun to do and a great workout, too! The moves are easy (if I can to them, anybody can) and the workout gets me sweatin'! The total body burn DVD is my fave. Great cardio. Works the entire bod in about 40-45 min. - perfect for time-crunched exercisers like me. Shaun T is mucho entertaining w/abs to die for! HIP HOP ABS Package - Fat Burning Cardio, Ab Sculpt, Total Body Burn, Secrets to Flat AbsHe is inspiring. His workouts effective. I'll buy more of his stuff fo' sho'."
4,it's ok,it's ok. none of it's really for beginners...when showing you moves..moves alittle to fast for my taste. Its like he's forgotten the people buying these dvd's are over weight. I find it hard to keep but. But once I get into shape I think will be able to do it fine. I am sticking with it even if it does give ne a head ache after every 30 mintue session.
3,Review,Wouldn't buy this product. It's not very effective. Arrived fast. All Dvd's were in great condition
3,Not the best- A little repetitive,"Some of these workouts are very good. The moves are fun but a few are waaaay too repetitive. Seriously the same moves go on and on and on. The music isn't that great either. I thought when i bought this that it would be the hip hop songs i heard on the radio or songs i used to hear on the radio, but nope. Minus these two cons, the program is pretty decent."
4,"Fun, feels like you're not working out!","I do this during the weekends or just when i want to go easy and have fun...i love Shaun T, he's fun to workout with. during weekdays i'm doing Shaun T's Insanity... anyway, the tilt, tuck, tight really works, but you have to do it as he instructed in order for you to really feel it. this dvd is also fun to do with your family and friends together."
4,HIP HOP ABS,"Bought the used video a month ago - it was listed as 'Very Good'. Other than having to push the volume way up to hear it, and a couple of blips (2-3 second stalls) during the playback, it is well worth the $19.99). Don't like the echo in the background (there is another video playing at the same time and it was annoying at first).The content is excellent. Look forward to it every day and have lost 8 pounds in just under four weeks (also follow South Beach diet so that helped). It is challenging (has modified versions) but Shaun T. leads you through it very well. I use P90X but parts of it are a bit much for me at 66 years old.Oh, I'm a guy and it has 4-5 'eye-candy' ladies and you don't have to watch Shaun T. all the time (there are a couple of guys in it, so you don't feel like you are crashing your wife's cardio class).Definitely worth the $20 -- gonna get Part 2 now."
3,My Abs,"Haven't worked with this much so far, but I doubt that it will do much for my abs, cause the movements just don't work the abs much. It's a good aerobic workout that will burn calories and help the user loose weight - it gets you sweating. Shawn T is entertaining and moves quickly, but it is sometimes difficult to follow him. I tried to slow the motion with my player but that did not work with these DVD's. If you want a good aerobic workout, this may be for you, just don't expect it to do much for your abs."
5,this is the best book ive ever ever read,"this book is very inspiring and imposible to put down.It is sad,happy,funny,suprising,and very interesting,i never finished a book that was more than 30 pages long and if i started to read a book it would take me 4 or 5 weeks to get to 30 pages ,not this book though ii took me two days to read it all and now i wish i would have took my time i feel like i got to know preston and his family as if they were mine it was kinda sad to know it was all over!It wazzzz a fabulous i mean great,if you dont get this book youre missing the book of a life time i kniow i sound older but im only 13 and this book is for everyone,i could read it over and over again!"
4,Brite Creates a Great New Addition to THE CROW Franchise,"The was the first book I read by Poppy Z. Brite, and I do not regret it one bit. I recognized the name, but the main reason I bought it was that it was a The Crow novel that didnt cost 13-20 bucks.Brite's dark style of writing and chracterization was great. She went a little away from the Crow mythos, but did a great job none the less. I love all of her referances to Edgar Allen Poe and the main charater's (a crow and RAVEN are relatives)were interesting. But going away from The Crow mythos was probably her only flaw.This inspired me to test her other stuff out, so I read Lost Souls, which was really great. I would definately suggest this one."
4,She's back...,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this, and I wasn't disappointed. She throws in her usual twists and turns with the characters she chooses (where DOES she get these ideas??). She fumbles a little at first in organizing their stories, but then she's not using her usual ""formula"", either. As always, the prose is Poppy--poetic and hypnotic. She's been a little experimental lately, and although I may not have enjoyed Exquisite Corpse as much, I'm grateful that she's still writing for HER...she'll never sell out, and she deserves mucho respect for that."
1,40 degrees?,"I understand that just about any Synthetic sleeping bag under $200 is going to be overrated, probably by 10 degrees. But man is this bag waaaaay off. I bought one of these years ago before i really got into backpacking (i.e. didn't know a thing) night during cub scout camping season rarely hit 40 degrees here in Arizona, so I bought this bag excited that it was only 2 1/2 lbs. Well, I froze my butt of on several mid to low 50's nights in this Piece of crap. I have since learned how to buy a good sleeping bag, which invariably means ignoring all slumberjack bags."
2,Not pleased.,If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless) Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.I wouldnt use it for anything but the summer (and you will most definatly need a good pad)
4,Smooth vibes and Awesome riffs...,Plumb is one of the few christian bands who cand dish out good music. Tiffany Arbuckle's voice is melodic while the rest of the band has a sound that's not afraid to go new places. My only quirk is GOD isn't talked about as much as I like. But that shouldn't stop you from getting BOTH CD's they've put out. Plumb is a christain band that will always get your attention...
4,Buy it just for Drugstore jesus!,"Overall, a sold work. However, The lead singer, Tiffany Arbuckle, soars with octave leaps on the word ""Drug_store"" on track 10 (Drugstore jesus). She performs throughout the album with immeasureable conviction, but if you want to get a peek into her deepest emotions and faith in God, then Drugstore jesus is where you go. Her phrasing and style transfer to the listener in a very warm, genuine manner. Tiffany and her vocal qualities are pure like gold!"
4,Good Study Bible,"The One Year Bible is a great way to study the Bible in a year. I prefer the NLT text when I study at home. The small size of the Bible is nice, too. It would only be better if they put cross-references in there. Other than that, I'd say it's a great choice and a good value for the price."
1,Compare Before You Buy - Liked One Year Bible on Kindle but I need another version...,"Hebrews 2:6New Living Translation (2007)What we do see is Jesus, who was given a position ""a little lower than the angels""; and because he suffered death for us, he is now ""crowned with glory and honor."" Yes, by God's grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone.English Standard Version (2001)But we see him who FOR A LITTLE WHILE was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.Hebrews 2:9New Living Translation (2007)For in one place the Scriptures say, ""What are mere mortals that you should think about them, or A son of man that you should care for him?English Standard Version (2001)It has been testified somewhere, ""What is man, that you are mindful of him, or THE son of man, that you care for him?"
2,DONT BUY,"Bought this 11 months ago now and Saturday will be the 5th time someone comes out to "" repair"" it. The microwave is great when it works.....lat time we were without a microwave for over 2 weeks. Buy something else!!!"
5,Perfection,"Holds everything. Makes perfect pot roasts. I use all clad MC2 for most cooking, but when I need to braise I use this -- I love it."
5,You want one of these!!!,"I friggin' love this thing! My food always tastes incredible (especially things like soups). I'm a little paranoid about cooking with Teflon, so I basically use this pot and Lodge cast-iron skillets for everything. If you get this pot buy Alice Water's ""The Art of Simple Food."" The pair makes for a great wedding present, too."
2,Good product but easily dented,"I must said it does a great job for cooking soup and stew. However, It is too fragile. Since this is my first LC piece which I'm long for. I used it with extra care, still I accidentally dent the cover during handwash on my second used. Am really disappointed as it is such an expensive cookware which should be make more robust for day to day use. Now, I starts worry about will the dent area get rust........'"
5,Do not hesitate!,"Yes, it's pricy but this is one of those pieces of kitchen equipment that, after you have it, you will wonder how you ever cooked without it.And I can add after doing research Amazon has the best price, once you consider that you're saving tax (and in IL that's almost 10%) and shipping."
2,The movie is awsome the album sucks.,Tokyo drift was an awsome movie. But I can't say the same for the soundtrack. It sucks. The 2 fast 2 furious soundtrack was a lot better than this one. That album atleast sounded good with all the songs put together on it. This album jumps around from tokyo japanese hip hop to some moderen punk rock. As good as this movie was I only wish they would of taken a little more time and made the soundtrack better. As far as this album goes don't go waste your money on it just burn a copy of it.
1,"bad movie, not just cliched","a totally mindless car racing movie. ego plus guts plus horse power of a car's engine plus after market addons plus reckless driving.... for what? a hollow movie for teenagers, maybe. bad script, bad actings...what else?"
3,This soundtrack could have been better!,"I think the soundtrack is ok, there is only a few of the best song's from the movie on the cd, and for those that wanted to know the unknown's I had to find them myself and here are some of them:One playing when sean and han walk into the chick filled club where han makes out with a few and has lyrics that go, ""Hey mommy you sexy"" is called Fannypack - Hey Mami.The one playing in the beginning when sean get's owned by dk for the first time the fast-paced techno song is called, ""Atari Teenage Riot - Speed""The one playing when they first enter the garage is, ""Grits - My Life Be Like""There was one playing while the chick is drifting (sean was in the car too) still looking for that one I'll post when I find it.Nonetheless the movie itself was great and I thoroughly enjoyed it, I give it 2 thumb's WAY up.."
2,Does not justify the claim in the title,"The title of this book is true only if your use of statistics never gets beyond the level of correlation, simple regression, basic probability and the normal curve. For all others, which include most people that use statistics, this book falls far short. There is nothing about statistical inference, the statistical foundation of research, quality control testing and all reaching of ""conclusions"" based on sampling. For decades I have taught a course in basic statistics and inference is approximately 2/3 of the class.I have a fundamental aversion to books that claim to be the ""only book that you will ever need"", for they never are. This book is one of the worst offenders, it comes nowhere close to being complete."
5,Don't Experiment With Your Health - GET THIS BOOK & READ IT,"While suffering through a severe reaction to hormones, I struggled to find a single medical doctor who took seriously the lethal impact these 'commonplace' drugs can have. Barbara Seaman, however, truly understands the dangers of hormone use. Before you fill another prescrption for birth control, HRT, fertility drugs, or any other hormones (including OTC progesterone cream), please read everything you can get your hands on by Barbara Seaman! In this excellent, fascinating book, Ms. Seaman offers critically important information concerning hormones and their impact on the health and lives of women. What you read could (literally) save your life. Like me, you may end up begging all of your friends and family to read this book. I wish that I could get copies of it into the hands of as many people as possible."
4,Cool plane. Needs LOTS of space to fly it.,"This is a really cool product. The plane can take pictures while in flight, though I had a little difficulty with picture taking. Not every press of the photo taking button resulted in a picture being taken. Launching is a little tricky. You have to pull back on the launch cord with a large amount of force in order for the plane to get enough speed to get airborne. But once you get the hang of it, it's not bad. The big thing is that you need LOTS of open space to fly this thing and must have NO wind while flying. The engines aren't powerful enough to fly against anything but the smallest breeze. Also, it's kind of an expensive model so if you have no experience with RC planes you might want to learn on a less expensive model plane like the ones sold by Air Hogs."
4,Outstanding,This book is right on the money. I work for a small department and guidance when it comes to report writing is limited. This answered just about all my questions and the hummor definitly helped.
3,A Little Slow,This book took me a while to get into. It was a little slow for my liking. I reall tried to give it a chance. Just couldnt get into it. Author not to have any others in his catalog.
2,Buyer be cautious,"Buyers should be cautious about buying this product. The documentation is horrible, and the clips that hold the Powermeter around your golf shaft look like they will break with time -- we'll see. The Powermeter appears to work by measureing the centrifical force generated at the club grip. So you can get higher speeds depending on where the Powermeter is placed. However, the swing speed appears close to the figures I have seen in a golf shops, and the Powermeter is an inexpensive tool that can be used to measure swing speed over time."
5,Helpful points,"Interested in purchasing rental property, I picked this book up the other day. It is not a ""make millions in real estate"" book but a down-to-earth book written for the commen person interested in buying a couple of properties. The author tells you what he prefers to do but provides information on other options, and he always seems to point out little ways to save money. The advice seems sound and covers everything from finding a property to financing to rent collection. He covers the pros and cons of using management companies and gives the reader ideas on how to make their property more attractive to tenants. Highly recommended."
3,Freak the Funk,"Early 90' s Funk/rock is alive and kicking. The drums are heavy , the bass is wide , and leader Kelvyn Bell's psycho guitar solos make this album as dope as any Chili Peppers album you'll find."
3,Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts,"The movie was interesting and enjoyable. There was a good story line and easy to follow and understand. I watched it and enjoyed it very much. I am 71 years old, male."
2,Another option that's free,Here is a great free alternative.Step 1 - Park your car in your garage in the position you consider perfect.Step 2 - Tie a tennis ball or a small stuffed animal to a string then hang the string from the ceiling of your garage so the tennis ball touches the center of your windshield.That's it! Pull into your garage until the your windshield hits the tennis ball or stuffed animal. It works every time and never needs adjusting... and it's absolutely free!
1,Buyer Beware,"This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way. I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use. It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off. When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up."
3,literature book,"The seller was very honest about the damage of the books. The arrival of the material was awesome, thanks"
2,A long way from Predator,"The idea that this could have inspired Predator is laughable. This is probably the lowest budget movie I have ever seen. The ""space monsters"" are guys in black with diving tanks. Interesting how the monsters carry the exact same kind of guns the Earthlings do? Like they all were owned by the same guy? No, this is pure silliness. If you're looking for a Lash Larue movie, check out one of his westerns when he was in his prime; this is not his best work. But it is good natured, and the lead girl has astonishingly pretty legs, so if you like those grade Z style movies, give it a shot."
3,underwhelmed,"This is less a review than a reaction--others have ""reviewed"" the tale well. I found the book ultimately disappointing. The characters were either fairly ""stock"" or minimally explored, and the story seemed to progress almost on automatic pilot. So predictable in places, and so ""surface"" in others. Some symbolism was almost ridiculous in its transparency. It seems to me that not a lot of effort was spent on this fairly formulaic novel. Some reviewers loved the character of Delia, but I found her kind of revolting, actually. Because I had some time to read over the holidays, I finished the book, but not with enormous pleasure. This is not one of Lurie's finest efforts."
4,For teaching,If you plan to teach or preach the gospel this . Is a good read and short enough. For a quick read
4,So far so good...been using it about a week or 2.,"So far so good...been using it about a week or 2. I don't have much exp. with this or any other model so it's tough to say. I think it's a bit noisy but that's prob. because it's mounted to the inside of the garage wall that's shared with the living room.....If it was on another wall, I prob. would never hear it I guess. Works well so far and everything was there......Came quick too!"
1,"Good idea, poor engineering","Even when I realized that it were merely a storage device (not a reader), Disk Stakka still seemed interesting. But then... within 5 minutes I realized it couldn't eject any disc I inserted. After calling 3M, they suggested an ""automatic calibration"" probably because ""the plate must have been misaligned with the ejecting slot"". It worked at first but started to fail after another 5 minutes. Surprisingly, ""auto-calibrating"" the device again - a 10 minutes process - worked for the next 2 ejects. Afterwards it refused to eject unless you ""calibrate it"" again. I asked for a replacement unit to 3M and they said that since I've bought it online on eBay (it was sealed and brand new - mind this), they couldn't do anything to help me. By the way: they don't offer any kind of repair service on this product. Even if you're willing to pay (like me). If it breaks on you, you're on your own."
2,"Nice Concept, poor design","I have ordered 3 of these, 2 arrived defective. The one that works is great! they apparently have a design flaw which prevents discs from being ejected. Returning/exchanging is a time consuming process. I'd look at alternative vendors."
1,WASTED $$,"At first all was good. Held CD's safe and secure. However, it decided that security wasn't good enough and promptly decided to beef up security by REFUSING to eject the CD's. So, my disk safe is is now truly SAFE and SECURE! Looks like I must learn the skills of safe cracking in order to free my enslaved CD's.Do not walk away - RUN, RUN, RUN away from buying the Imation Disk Stakka. I have watched for updates and there are no new updates - EVER. You may think (as I once did) that perhaps you will get lucky and get a solid piece of room saving hardware. FORGET about it, for it WILL fail you. A great idea done VERY WRONG. The single star is for just that... the idea."
1,"Horrible Purchase, Poor Support","I was very excited at the prospect of having a device store all of my discs in one place. I knew of the limitations (it doesn't have a reader, it only *stores* discs), but wanted it anyway. Even w/ the steep $100 price tag it seemed like a worthy investment.However upon receiving the unit it fails it's own self-tests (each time w/ a different non-sensicle error). Imation doesn't appear to have a US phone #, only an e-mail address and a support site that doesn't help. Poor design internally for storing discs and *very* cheap manufacturing. I would definitely stay away from this item.Update:Imation returned my support request with detailed instructions on how to manually reseat the internals of the unit. It does work now, and seems to be a common issue."
1,The biggest piece of CRAP! I have ever had.,"I would actually give these a negative 5 Stars if I could. I initially thought this was handy. Yet everytime I want to eject a disc it tells me something is blocking the gate, yet nothing is. I have 121 errors on 1, 358 errors on the 2nd, and 478 on the 3rd tird. I have taken them them apart and these things are junk. Cost to produce $[...]. Life of components: Thin flimsy rubber band used to drive the plastic gears should last 6 mos. The motor is about 1"". The strongest piece is the springs which keep the gate rollers in place. Its probably too strong which makes the gate too tight and stops the discs from ejecting. No wonder they have a 7 Day Return Policy. The support blows too! Do NOT waste your money.Sincerely,Matthew P."
2,List of errors in book,"If you buy the first edition of this book (August 2004), you should be aware that the publisher has released a list of errors (and they are many.) The errarta can be found at the publisher's website."
3,Kill the keyboardist !!,"Seeing Sonny live was magical. I saw him three times at the original Knitting Factory in NYC, and each time he played, the ceiling and walls would collapse as he would reduce the club to rubble. I couldn't wait to listen to this cd when I first got home with it... and then...disapointment!!...a total dud of a set is captured on this record, I couldn't believe it was the same guy!!The keyboard player on this cd sucks completely. He basically ruins the record for me...his playing is unlistenable and HIGHLY annoying, what a colossal mistake it was to have that guy on the recording...what a shame."
2,Very basic and meant only for those new to the study of leadership.,"Being a sailor myself, I really wanted to like this book. I have read several leadership books and find this one to be lacking. It is meant only for a beginners look at leadership. It is the standard ""Know your people"" and other very basic leadership ideas. I'm sure many people can get a lot from it, it just did not suit my purposes."
5,Strategic Insight into Leadership,"Lead On is both strategic and practical. The author (a distinguished Naval officer) does a masterful job of breathing life into leadership principles, presented within the context of submarine operations. It is both entertaining and purposeful."
3,Feels REALLY HEAVY,This is so huge and heavy it would snap the connector off my little hand-held CB radio instantly if i used it. Thought it was going to be much more lightweight and thin.
4,George uses all his talents!,This is one of my daughter's favorite CG books and one that Ican deal with reading more often. George uses both his legs and armsto flip pancakes faster than the chef can do it. I liked the positive focus on George's (and kid's) skills. It leaves the reader with a nice sense of accomplishment. END
4,Upside Down,"Received my Felknor Venture, started to plant tomotes, it's really working great for me living in an apartment. Just give your plants alot of water/sun and watch them grow. Thanks. RH"
1,Tomato tree a flop!,"I had high hopes for this product as I was tired of worms & bugs ruining my tomatoes each year. I put it together and filled with potting soil and water as directed. My tomato plants really took off and looked great but instead of growing down as the pictures show, they grew up toward the sun...until they got too heavy and flopped down and broke the stems. It's a great idea, but they didn't account for the plants natural tendency to grow up toward the sun. It is definitely not worth the money!"
4,Good Service,"Arrived within 2 days - a little more worn than I expected, but still useable.I would have no problem ordering form this vendor again."
4,Life is Suddenly Better,How good is this. Fluffy is now the pride of the neighbourhood. My neighbours were green with envy when they saw fluffy wearing this. It is so good I even wear it to the theatre too. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to look and feel like a million dollars.
3,Economy Class,"I purchased these headphones about a month ago. I utilize them running about 5-8 miles per day. Sound quality is just average, comfort is average but the wire construction is below average - it tangles quite a bit. However, the length of the cord is quite good and I experienced no issues with perspiration in or around the earbuds.Overall, I would not purchase this model again, simply because the sound quality is not up to my expectations."
1,Not Recommended,"I have very small ears, and was hoping these would be a good alternative to ear buds, which do not fit me. Unfortunately, these also fell off while I was running. The sound quality is pretty awful as well. They are cheap, but in the end, still a waste of money."
5,In one word...,"PERFECT!It does not flip flop when you run, good sound, light weight, and easy to put on. I am totally satisfied"
4,"Good first album, lots of potential","I first learned of Z Prochek at the Synthpop Goes the World festival in Toronto last summer (2002). My friend got a free band shirt there and thus made me look them up. I heard about six songs from them before this album came out, and five of them are on the album, changed around a little bit. This album is a nice mixture of hard edged industrial, danceable ebm, and synthpop with other styles mixed in for good measure. Where they truly shine is the more club friendly tracks where the lyrics can be easily heard such as One Last Time, Point Blank and especially Words, where such potential for great music is so vividly present, but the other tracks make the album varied and are all strong tracks. There is not a whole lot of innovation in working with ebm/industrial, but they definitely know how to make good music. Highly recommended for anyone into ebm/industrial/futurepop. Something for everyone that can take multiple listens to get the full effect."
4,baby's still fussy....,"I really like Dr. Brazelton's approach -- warm and loving but firm and respectful of sleep-deprived parents (thank you!) However, he makes it seem too easy, like ""follow steps 1-4 and your baby will be calm."" If only it were that simple. I wish he had taken things one step further, i.e., what to do when all his suggestions fail and the baby is still crying. I think in his effort to make this book short and practical, he overlooked how complex this process can be for parents with more difficult babies and/or whose confidence withers with baby's every crying jag."
2,Not What I Expected!,"I expected to see more of the Grand Canyon itself. But the majority of the film is Robert Redford et al rafting down the Colorado River. His dialogue is boring. The whole movie is more of a political/environmentl speech than anything else. There's not much 3D that I could see. In the opening scene there's a shot of the Grand Canyon in 3D (absolutely wonderful). I thought the rest of the film would be of this caliber, but as far as great 3D filming this was it. On the positive side the scenery was beautiful with or without 3D glasses."
2,auto-hagiography,"it contains very little practical info, and is primarily an ad for their own kayaks and videos, and a medium to broadcast what heroes they are - ""commander soares"" indeed! they dont go ""paddling"", they go on a ""mission""! these guys are doubtless good paddlers, but they cant write. to class the concluding poem ""kayak brother"" as ... would suggest it has literary merit (ie pathos), but it is just the stuff of cringe. guys, try understatement as a style for your next book, and put some useful info in it."
4,Columbus was a flawed man,"Byne does an excellent of getting behind the man and trying to get his life to make sense, using his diaries, and other materials that are available about his life. From his early years to his tragic end, the tale that she weaves is pretty convincing.."
3,Inappropriate for anything but 100% digital,"Although well written and useful for its target application, ""Principles of Functional Verification"" addresses only the concerns of 100% digital integrated circuit verification. It is only marginally useful for mixed signal system-on-chip verification.Now there's an opportunity for a book!"
5,I Like It...,"i listened to this for about 5 minutes in my friend's car. I am now saving to make a purchase. It makes me want to don a tight black suit and pack a P99.Here's my recomendation: ""This CD is zesty!"""
1,Who prepares the previews?,"I cannot believe the number of previews I get for the kindle that are utterly inadequate. Amazon is failing big time on this.For this book I get the Preface! And it is not the first time, but one of many."
3,Mountian Get out of my way life lessons and learned truths,"I purchased this book several years ago and found it to be very down to earth. I appreciate the fact that while Montel shared his not always so bright life with the public he was able to share lessons learned that could bless someone else who may have been going down the same path. I commend him as a man to be able to receive correction but to also admit fault and openly correct his behavior to make his future better. I also enjoyed the example of him standing up for his show and doing what he thought was a proper format not matter what the cost or what the network execs thought. Being an example for our youth is important and Montel showed that he could influence our children on their level and not preach at them. This book gives us all a reality check in things we can do to improve ourselves, our relationships, our children and our society. Continued success!"
5,Love this lube,"Simply put: I prefer Swiss Navy lube to all others. I have never been a fan of KY (waaaaay to sticky) and my old favorite Astroglide, while good, was too stringy and hard to apply. While the 1 hand pump is why I bought this stuff in the first place, the quality is also quite high. Also a GREAT price compared to porn stores.Note that I recieved the wrong item when I bought this. While that is not the fault of the product, but still worth mentioning."
4,just short of perfect,"This is a wonderful album full of exquisite pop melodies. Unfortunately, Victoria Lloyd's silky-smooth voice is not showcased as it was on the previous two albums (both of which I'd give 5 stars). She never cuts loose, which is a shame, because when she does, her voice has the gale-force power of Grace Slick in her prime, only without the rawness-- a remarkable thing to behold. Still, I'd recommend this album, because it is light-years beyond most of the stuff that passes for pop music these days."
4,Almost perfect,"This was a gift for my husband. He is a serious cook and wanted a smallish Le Creuset that he could use on the stove top and/or in the oven. This would be perfect except that the knob on the top of the lid cannot be put in a very hot oven, and that is exactly what he wanted to do! Other than that it is great."
4,A fun CD for listening,"My former piano teacher, who was born before jazz was invented, often said that classical music and jazz were different--too much so for him to appreciate jazz. Oh, how he would have loved this CD! I headed straight for the music store as soon as I heard the first track of the CD (Jesu, Joy of...). Every person who has overheard the CD has asked to borrow it, and all rave about the intriguing, yet not distracting, music.I am going to buy several copies as stocking stuffers. I wonder what the group's version of The Nutcracker sounds like...."
2,Very pretty - not durable,"I bought this curtain for the rarely used shower in our guest bathroom. I was very pleased when I first put it up several months ago, I even bought the matching dragonfly curtain rings to finish the look. However, when our first guest used it, the open weave connecting the trim and the body began to fray. A slight tug by my 16 month old completly separated half the curtain from the trim. It doesn't seem reparable, so I'm looking for something more durable to match the rings!"
3,ALRIGHT PRODUCT,HAVEN'T GOT TO USE BUT ONCE CAN'T REALLY SAY MUCH. SOUND IS GOOD PLAYED CD FINE.FOR THE PRICE IT WAS A GOOD BUY.AT THIS TIME I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
4,"Great Stereo, Defective Remote","All of the features listed for this product are present and work properly except for the remote. Nothing I did would make the remote work. I've requested another remote be sent to me, but we'll see how that goes. Just a heads up about that."
1,Broke during first use,"I was very excited about this product because it is hard to find an affordable CD/cassette player these days. However, during my first time using it the CD portion of it malfunctioned and I had to return it. I'm not sure if this happened during shipping or is just faulty but I returned the product immediately."
1,Coby,"Poor quality sound, even worse with cassettes which is why I bought this. Difficult to tune dial."
4,Good Value,"While one of the two Boom Boxes I order had a slight problem, it was replaced quickly and based on what I paid, they are a great value and are holding up well."
2,You get what you pay for......................,"I bought the least expensive CD player listed above.Seems to have a mind of its own...................while listening to it, the music will soften, then get louder, no matter what CD you play on it. It has a tinny sound, and there's no way to alter the tone. Can only take one CD at a time. Not impressed at all."
1,no good,The toy was very small an expensive. It was not worth the money. The veil did not attach to the dress.
4,"5 STARS FOR SISSEL, 3 STARS FOR SONGS, AVERAGE=4 STARS!","Having been introduced to Sissel's gorgeous angelic voice through the soundtrack of TITANIC, I could not wait for her long overdue US release and what a treat it is overall!! Her voice is so soothing, captivating, clear, gorgeous.....she can sing anything to me and I would be impressed by HER VOICE! However, some of the songs on this album do not do her justice....but the standout awesome tracks are CAN'T GO BACK, ALL GOOD THINGS, WE BOTH KNOW, CARRIER OF A SECRET, SOLITAIRE and SHOULD IT MATTER.....the others while good are not as stellar as these! Buy this cd though and be swept away into the world of SISSEL!"
5,Breathtaking!,"I first heard Sissel's voice in Titanic and fell in love with it automatically. She has such a soothing voice. If you haven't heard her voice, think Celine Dion and Enya put together. I highly recommend this CD."
3,Somewhat uneven horror movie,It you're a huge fan of Japanese horror movies you will probably appreciate this flick. If not the move is a mixed bag. There are some compelling and suspenseful scenes throughout. The director does a good job forcing the viewer to try and figure out if they are watching something real or the main character's psychotic fantasies. Some slow pacing here and there will probably limit the audience who will truly appreciate this film.Of note to Puffy fan's is Yumi Yoshimura appearance as the wife of the bully. She does a respectable job playing the role of wife and mother.If this is your genera of movie it's worth a watch.
5,Mesmerizing,"Ok check this..the Japanese know how to make films. This one along with Ichi the Killer(which I highly recommend)is a must have for horror fans, Hostel fans, Tarantino fans, Romero and last but not least Argento fans. If you are a real fan of any of the above-mentioned you will enjoy this movie..it is freakn awesome."
2,Not at all like his current work,"If you are a huge Dougie MacLean fan, you will probably want to buy this just to hear some of his very early work. But you'd be better off buying ""Early"". This is not at all like his current work, it is sounds a lot like Pop music, and in fact was heavily influenced by the record label. If you want to get started on a Dougie MacLean collection, and you are new to his music, you should start with Craigie Dhu."
3,CSI: The Soundtrack,"The opening track (The Who's Who Are You) and the Grissom/ Investigation themes really make this soundtrack. The other tracks are good, but they were mostly used only in small pieces and only for a few seconds during the episodes. Being a die-hard CSI junkie, I was somewhat dissapointed in this album, but the 2 themes ( Grissom and Investigation ) plus ""Who Are You"" make this a must have for us CSI wanna-bes!"
5,Mothers 20524 FX Wheel Cleaner - 24 oz,Great product. I think this is so far one of the best product in the market then other products I have use from the market through out the years. You pay little bit more then other product but every penny is worth it...
2,Difficult assembly,"Very difficut assembly and a lack of consise instruction. The translation to english sometimes gets mixed up, making it difficult to understand. Quality of fit is also poor."
4,I think this is a great book especially for beginners!,"This is one of those few books a programmer can find he can't do without. While it does not go into depth in certain areas and limits graphics to 256 colors, the principles and the way they are explained make this a must read!"
2,Chalky residue on calipers,"Just used this for the first time. Works as advertised. However, it left a white chalky residue on the calipers that I am finding very difficult to get off. i.e. toothbrush & soap and water. Feel this is something Mother's should have warned about. Makes the very easy, pretty hard."
2,Mothers foaming wheel cleaner,"It does not work well without brushing and I estimate that a 24 oz bottle would only last max 3 washes, 2 if you have large wheels."
5,No more elbow grease with this product,I buy this from Amazon on a regular basis.I use this on both our cars with have aluminum wheels. I only get to wash my cars every other week. So the brake dust and road grime really builds up. This product has saved my shoulders and elbows. All you have to do is spray it on while the tires & wheels are cold and let it do the hard work. I might break out an old soft bristle brush for the hard to clean areas to loosen up the grim a bit just before hosing off the tires & wheels. That's all there is too it.A fantastic product. Give it a try .... it will save you work and time.loudcloud.us is where we list solutions that we have found to work well for us.
2,"Not as comfortable as expected, Radio pillow never worked and broke apart!","The hammock packs well, but it is not as comfortable as I would've liked. The radio pillow never worked and it's pieces fell off of it before I even put it behind my head. It is not a comfortable pillow either."
4,Hammock review,"Hammock is comfortable and easy to set up and down, but the pillow could be left out. Only a minor negative."
2,Never ordered it,"I never ordered it. Amazon charged my card $ 130.00. Product weighs over 20 lbs & is lengthy. I am a senior citizen with debilitating Arthritis. Amazon insisted I get package back to the Post Office & return via Parcel Post. Amazon was indifferent to my plight. Could never get anyone ""live"" on the phone to address the situation. Had to call a taxi service.Pawleys Island Original Collection Large DuraCord Rope Hammock, Oatmeal"
3,"Very sturdy , easily assembled, somewhat heavy",This hammock served very well for the summer and seems like it will last many more years. Portable and compact but be prepared to carry weight if you have to walk. Still in the yard and was used every day. Easy to sit in and get off. Very strong and well made. For people of average weight this hammock would be fine. Easy to assemble.
5,Earned brownie points & pleased my vision,Makes the wife's upper torso region look pretty nice! She could not find these in department stores anymore and I think we saved a few bucks.
5,GREAT IDEAS!,This book is wonderful for those times when you need a little help creating that special handmade card or doing scrapbooking. I love it!
5,very helpful in scrapbooking,I have recently started making my own cards. This book is very helpful. I have been able to find the perfect verse for each of the cards I have made.
5,Chow Chows Rule....,"I contributed 12 photographs to this project and at the time it was printed...this book did a good job of showing where the Chows where today. Also mentioned were the Kennels that raised the Chows and showed them in the ring. If you want a good quality Chow, then I think you should go with a breeder. I have owned 5 Chows and still have a white male that runs the house.Full blooded Chows are a joy to live with...It was a greatexperience to be a part of this project..."
3,It's OK,"An okay book - interesting writer but not great, not as compelling as I would have hoped it would be."
3,Mostly good but rubber cap falls off a lot,"I bought this to use on my 5 year old daughter's 16"" bike. It installed pretty easily. It works fine, but the spring it too strong for her to kick the stand to the up (stowed) position by herself. She has to use her hands or have me do it. I'm hoping the spring will loosen up after some time. Also, the rubber cap on the bottom falls off a lot. It seems it should be a tighter fit. The rubber cap is needed since we do bring the bike in the house as we do not have a garage."
5,You can't go wrong with this one.,"This stand is not fancy but has a clever adjustment for different heights. I put it on my daughter's 20"" bike and adjusted the height with the push-button and voila.At first it was stiff to kick into place, but after ca. 10 times of use it loosened up and works like a charm.A minor quibble is that the rubber casket fell off the end, but a little crazy glue fixed it.Good product at a great price!"
3,Not so good,"I have over 10 years of electronics design experience but have never used VHDL (CUPL and ABLE, yes). This book seems like it was written not by a hardware designer, but a by a programmer. Starting with zero knowledge of VHDL, his examples are hard to follow, and coding style is not consistant leading to confusion. I downladed a free tutorial program from Aldec.com and it has helped my understanding of the book GREATLY. In fact, it turns out the author references Aldec's Active-HDL simulator in appendix A.To Mr. Yalamanchili's credit, he does clearly state in his book, on page x of the preface, that this is supposed to be a supplementary text.I would recommend another book if you want to buy a ""VHDL for Total Noobs"" type that could also serve as a reference later on.Also, a glossary would have helped greatly."
5,Excelente par de CD's,"He sido un admirador de Luz Casal ya por cierto tiempo. Y este par de CD's vinieron a reemplazar aquellos que se han quedado en el camino prestados y no devueltos.Esta compilación cubre lo esencial de Luz, que con su versatilidad puede lo mismo cantar una balada pop, un bolero o un rock & roll.""Entre mis recuerdos"" es una canción que todavía me pone chinita la piel, cada vez que la escucho.Altamente recomendable."
1,Not that the book is bad but the binder sure is!,"The book's content wasn't bad, but the binder was a mess. The first book showed up with a bent cover and looked used. I sent it back for a replacement. The new book I was sent had a binder that was completely bent and broken to the point where I couldn't turn the pages. HOWEVER, the real problem I noticed was that the second book I got had more pages/recipes than the first! The pages in the book aren't numbered, so you don't even know pages are missing! I would never have known if it weren't for the second book I got. I returned the second broken one for a refund rather than a replacement because I felt like I would never know if I was getting a complete book. Wouldn't be a bad book if it weren't for the way it is put together."
4,Like it,I think since it was 1st published they had some additions that were added to the front of the book. Looks like some nice things to try.
2,Could work I suppose,"This book is easy to read & sympathetic but it didn't work for me. Staying with my baby while he was supposed to self-soothe (as recommended) did not help him or reassure him in any way. He cried continually, stopping for no more than 2 mins at a time. It worked better for me to leave him, returning every 10 - 15 mins for very brief periods of reassurance. He still cried but less & less each day. I think there are babies for whom the stay-with-them style could work, but not all, and alas, not mine."
5,Metra Harnesses,"I personally prefer the Metra harnesses,its a personal choice,well made,will not overload,ever,soldering iron and you can be in your cave,garage,workshop or kitchen and in about 10 minutes you are ready to go,makes your unit a plug n play and NO cutting of your factory harness,if you sell the vehicle you can unplug,put the original unit back in and are good to go."
5,Panasonic Great Value,It's all about value and as usual Panasonic delivers. Easy user interface makes our entry into HD a breeze. We've had the tv for about a month and we are pleased.
4,Chargers,It's the brand I always used and it has never let me down. I will continue to use this product.
5,Cream Whippers Chargers - Accept No Substitutes,I needed these for Thanksgiving and bought a substitute locally. Don't be fooled - iSi Cream Whippers for the iSi Cream Whipper. The substitutes made an ugly foam that looked unappetizing. iSi makes the best cream whipper and the best chargers!
3,Loose but good,"I placed an order for this product and it came in great time. However due to it being shipped in an envelope instead of a shipping box, the product arrived scattered and I had to repack it into the box that came with it. Other than that, the product is in great shape and I am excited to wrap it for Christmas."
3,"OK Film, but no Watson","Granada Televison had a resourceful, but rather annoying habbit of, when Jeremy Brett couldn't take the part of Holmes, or whoever was playing Watson wasn't available, of removing them and bring Sherlock's older and smarter brother, Mycroft, into the case. When THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ was being filmed, Edward Hardwicke couldn't be at the studioes to play Watson, so Charles Gray was brought into the show to play Mycroft. A good film, but the loss of Watson makes it a bit less entertaining."
3,This was a nice story,"Sons of Mistletoe is an endearing Christmas story about love, loss, perseverance, and triumph. It's a great light-hearted family movie that teaches about values and friendships; and can easily become a new Christmas family tradition."
2,At least they are chewable,"Thats about all I can say for this product. I have used many different brands of creatine and this one feels the weakest. I love the idea of being able to pop one in my mouth without having to add water and stir it up. Very convenient. However, I find myself having to take two or three just to notice it. They need to up the dosage or come out with a more potent version. Great idea but poor execution."
5,Just to clarify.......,"Just to clarify what you can expect when you open your container.I was somewhat under the impression(because of the product title)that these chews were chewy.That is not the case however,they look and taste exactly like orange flavored vitamin C tablets.Having said that they do taste good in a ""vitaminy"" kind of way,and are extremely convenient.If these things produce results they will be a home run!"
5,"Easy, convenient, and great product","I like the accessability of this product, instead of carrying powders, or large horse pills, they are about the size of a mini marshmallow, and chew easily. The taste is great, and as with all universal products, it works. I will be using this product again."
5,Great dvd that is NOT outdated,This is a great dvd from a professional digital painter. I can honestly say I learned a lot about environment design that I did not know before. However I was skeptical to get it because of the negative review posted here. I ran into the same problem and the dvd is NOT outdated but this is Mac's fault because they refuse to run flash on their new OS. However I contacted The Gnomon Workshop (unlike the other reviewer) and they gave me an easy workaround to get the files. This is a great tutorial and I fully recommend it!
1,Stellar review = worst buy ever,"Bought the isi chargers, and half of them were gas-less, yup gas-less. I tried contacting ISI and they couldn't offer me a explanation as to why it happened, except a sorry and contact amazon for refund..thank you calling ISI *click*... SERIOUSLY!!!???? I'm sorry, but the only reason I bough this brand was because of the high review it received, but seriously... half of my charger box comes out gas-less?????!!!!! All I have to say is STELLAR REVIEW = WORSE BUY EVER!!!!"
5,Just say N2O,Excellent cream chargers. No flavor in the cream. Too bad they can't get more gas in these.
1,Descent book on virology,"The way the concepts are presented in this text book are far from being fair. They are poorly demonstrated and use of pictures is poor. While it serves its use in giving information on virology at a great price, it fails in comparison to other books, while double the price, worth it in every way. I recommend saving up and getting either Medical Virology, 4th ED or Sherris Medical Microbiology; either one is good and far better then this title - as well as providing way more information, the latter book includes key concepts in immunology, parasitology and indepth on bacteriology. Don't be fooled by the price, this information isn't presented clearly to learn virology off of. If you're serious in learning about virology and/or infectious diseases, check out first the books stated above first."
2,ineffective text book,"The author made a huge mistake with this one. It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all. This book is a complete waste of time. The only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out there."
3,Too soon to tell if it works,"I've been using this product once a day for about 3 weeks and haven't seen any results so far. However, it's taken many years for my skin to look like it does and I can't expect miracles. Again, it's too soon to see results but once the lotion/collagen is gone I'll have a better idea."
2,"Feels as Dated as it is, lacks interest","I was SO excited to watch this documentary... I love the beauty and the struggle that comes with the art of ballet and I was so, so disappointed with this film. Granted, it's quite old now but it just NEVER got going. It didn't delve deeply at ALL into the world of ballet, instead most of the film is showing the actual performance of Swam Lake. I wanted to learn about the dancers, see into their lives, watch their struggles, see their pain and triumph but they were so GUARDED and BORING. They had VERY little to say during the entire film. Very, very little. What little they did say was very generic, 'I don't really like class' or 'I was nervous, but I was excited'. Truly, this is as in-depth as it got. I'd be SO interested if someone re-made something like this that really explored further."
1,"sad, really","I loved the original ghost recon, but this is not even close. You can't save...you can't pick up weapons even when you are out of ammo...the firing reticle looks like the background...and there doesn't seem to be any difference in the power of most of the rifles. Also, how about a silencer that is actually silent.This game was a bummer...way to kill a franchise."
1,Not even in the ballpark of an advanced warfighter...,"Some of the extremely aggravating things about this game are 1) the AI ghosts either wander off and do their own thing or get stuck somewhere and you have to go run into them a few times to get them unstuck, 2)the gameplay is predictable and very very linear (you can only go a certain way even if it takes you directly into a line of fire), 3) there are some problems with the graphics where you see your team mate in places they aren't and get stuck on some of the trees and hillsides, and 4) there are no save points in a multiplayer mission.On the plus side, the game is very challenging (even on the easiest settings). For the cost of this game and the amount of frustration that it causes, I would just buy something else."
2,Another Rainbow Six Game!,"I had been waiting for the next ghost recon game for PC for about 2 years. Imagine my dissapointment when I read many reviews telling how none of the aspects of the original game carried over. I thought maybe I'd buy it anyway and give it a shot but everything I had read about it was right. This is not Ghost Recon, just another Urban Warfare game. The vast open areas of the forest, jungle, and desserts - gone. The ability to switch between sqaud members - gone. The ability to quick save your game - gone. No more variable weapon zoom either. Everything that made the first Ghost Recon such a great game has been removed and in its place you have yet another game to add to the Rainbow Six series. Sure, its a decent game and the graphics are nice but it does not deserve the Ghost Recon title. If you loved the original game then I'd save your money on this one."
4,Olivia never dies,"I have been one of her biggest fans, I grew up when she was in her hieght of her career. This is one of her softer albums, nice easy listen. I have all her albums, and most of them now on CD's. I've always felt like she had a voice of an angel...."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,I read this book over a long span of time maybe thats the reason it did not manage to hold my interest. but the book definetly has a gripping start and then somewhere somehow.......
5,The best thriller I have ever read,I would give anything to find a thriller I enjoyed anywhere near as much as the Poet. I cannot believe it has not been made into a movie! Even Michael Connelley's other books cannot compare to the Poet for me. It was a reading experience as phenomenal as seeing Silence of the Lambs for the first time. If anyone can find me a thriller that is as flawless as this one please let me know.
1,A roller coaster ride of a thriller that crashes in the end.,"Could not put the book down as the chase for the serial killer goes through several states and the FBI. However, the ending could be written by a 10 year old who can't explain why the things happened or any reason for it! Don't read the book if you like mysteries that are solvable or sensible. I don't and would not recommend this book to anyone"
4,"strong, if flawed, thriller","This is one smart thriller-- I plow through stacks of crime novels to find one this smart. The first half is as good as anything you're likely to come across in modern crime fiction. Unfortunately, however, it's a little too clever for its own good-- the ending (and it's set-up) really push the credibility envelope. What also hurts, but to a lesser degree, are the cliches that infect the second half of the novel-- the female FBI agent falling for the journalist, a nasty character and his comeuppance, etc.-- and one flaw that allows a too-lengthy showdown between the journalist and the suspect in a camera store. Too bad, because Connelly is a smart and engaging writer."
5,This book is flat out awesome,"I've been reading the Bosch series, skipping over the non-Bosch books. I decided to go back and read the non-Bosch books because some of his other characters showed up in one of the Bosch books I've read (""A Darkness More than Night"") and from previews I know that others will show up in Bosch books I've yet to read. Well this book is flat out awesome. The writing was fantastic; the best Connelly book that I've read to date (""Lost Light"" is the last Bosch book that I've read). There is a dark tone to the book that comes out right at the beginning and never leaves. The characters are great; I can't wait until I get to the next book that has Jack McEvoy with a major role. It's got that hard to define quality that makes you want to keep reading and that earns the book the old ""page turner"" cliche. I highly recommend ""The Poet."""
4,A good book but,"It would have been that much better if it ended on page 400 instead of page 500 as the author felt compelled to add these extra twist(s) whose contrivances only detracted from an excellent, exciting procedural mystery."
5,Connelly never fails to entertain,"The Poet was first published in 2002. I am so sorry I didn't know about his books until now but I am catching up! The Poet is Harry Bosch at his best and I look forward to finding ""The Narrows"" as I believe it is a sequel. The Poet is a heart pounding way to spend a few hours with your favorite author."
5,I couldn't leave to eat!,"It took me two evenings to read until page 100. But on the third day I read from 101 to 501 and couldn't put the book down, except to pay the pizza delivery man! Check out Connelly's other books and John Sandford's ""Prey"" series for more good reads."
5,Excellent! I'm ready for the next Connelly book!,"I couldn't put it down. Very few books held my interest as this one did. When I didn't have it in my hands, I was wishing that I did. It put me in the same frame of mind as The Alienist. Not an easy thing to do!"
4,"A great book, but lacked a great conclusion","Like most other reviewers I thought the ending was weak, thats all I will say without spoiling anything but the rest of the book was excellant, one of my favorites... It is worth the read, even with what I thought was a poor ending."
3,Not satisfying,"Jack McEvoy, a Denver crime beat reporter, learn that his twin brother, Sean has just killed himself using his police-issue service revolver. Jack decides to investigate his brother's suicide and finds evidence that Sean was murdered. What makes it worse is that during his investigation he finds similar cases of cop murders disguised as suicides all over the United States. Each one of those `suicides' left behind a note using the poetry of Edgar Allen Poe. Jack joins the FBI in a task force in search of the serial killer dubbed `The Poet'.The plotting is very confusing. While working in the investigation there is a red herring for another red herring. You are led to believe that a certain character is the Poet and then another one. When you read their alibis later it just seemed a little farfetched and a little too convenient for the story. It got to the point that I did not care who the Poet was and just wanted to finish the book."
5,Five Stars Are Not Enough,"Quite simply I rate ""The Poet"" as the best mystery/crime thriller I have ever read starting with The Hardy Boys as a youngster in the 1950's. I cannot count the number of times I have given this book as a gift to introduce friends to Miacael Connelly. It never fails to hook them and make them Michael Connelly fans as well. In my opinion Mr. Connelly is the finest in the genre currently writing. The Poet was impossible to put down. In fact I was sorely tempted to cheat and read some of the ending chapters early in the read. Resisted the temptation, but few books have enticed that behavior in me."
3,Full of Suspense and Intrigue,"The Poet is the 6th book review from the CORBEL Book Club. This book probably would have been rated higher, but 1 member in our group really did not enjoy the descriptiveness regarding the mutilation of human bodies (what does that say about the rest of us!) The author does a great job keeping your attention - a real page-turner. We found the twist of characters surprising. Many stated they did not like the ending - a little too much stage-setting for the next book perhaps... Overall a good read that keeps your interest."
5,WHAT A PLEASURE,"There is no middle ground for Connelly readers. I just finished this as my second non-Bosch book and was totally absorbed. If you have a long lonely weekend and need company, this is the book for you. If Michael was reading this I would tell him to get off the internet and keep writing."
2,"The curse of the ""Scooby Doo"" killer....","I enjoyed reading this book but the ending was very weak. I got the impression that Connelly didn't know who to choose to be the killer when he had to discard the obvious one. When I got to the end, I thought ""oh"", how dull."
3,What a travesty of an ending...,"The Poet is a solid read with the exception of a few minor annoyances in the plot. These include the FBI letting a reporter into the heart of their investigation (sympathy will not take you that far) and people actually committing bodily harm while under hypnosis. Nevertheless, I could easily get by these as the story unfolded. However, once I got to the ending, I was shocked at the abruptness and the randomness of the author's finale. Unfortunately, it left a bitter taste in my mouth after what had been a very enjoyable read. I still recommend it, as long as you're prepared for a letdown at the very end. This is the first book I've read by Michael Connelly and I plan to read more, assuming that his other books wrap-up with much smoother conclusions."
2,another serial killer,"Enough with the serial killers already! I found this book very disapointing. I got sucked in by the exceptional graphics of the cover and the advertising in the New York Times Book Review. Faked out again. The writing was average, the plot extremely derivative, the characters dull with ridiculous motivations, the female detective contrived and the ending. God, what an ending... Don't bother"
3,Interesing but stilted,"The best parts of the book were those that dealt with Gladden. Unfortunately they were also the smallest sections of the book. Someone must have told Mr. Connelly that the mark of a good suspense story is never to allow the reader to ""guess"" who the guilty party is. This was certainly true in this book since I doubt whether anyone could have deduced the true identity of ""The Poet"" Personally, I prefer suspense novels to either give me several possible suspects with motives that allow me to ""play"" detective as I read, or to introduce me to the guilty party early in the story and allow me to participate in the ""hunt"". I also felt that the characters were a little stiff and one dimensional as were the male-female relationships in the book. ""The Poet"" had the makings of another ""Silence of The Lambs"" but in my opionion fell short of the mark"
4,This mystery's early promise fails to deliver.,"Mr. Connelly's well-crafted prose through the first one hundred fifty pages sets the bar so high that one wonders how he will maintain his delicate mixture of surprise and poetry. Unfortunately, his writing loses passion as his plot heats up. Ultimately the reader becomes more engaged in outguessing the twists and turns of the protagonist's hunt for the Poet, than discovering the secrets of the characters. This would not be so bad in a run-of-the-mill thriller, but Mr. Connelly is such a fine writer that one expects more"
3,Clever but contrived,I recently read my first ever Michael Connelly book (Blood Work) and enjoyed it immensely. While this book is enjoyable enough and kept me interested I thought it was much more like hack work. I could see the ending coming and was disappointed when it unfolded as it did.
2,Just don't get it - slight spoiler,"This book requires you to buy into two basic premises: 1. that the FBI would allow a nobody newspaper reporter to be embedded into a major investigation (not!) and 2. a supposedly very ambitious female FBI agent would carry on an affair with the nobody newspaper reporter right under the noses of her boss and colleagues, during an active investigation (yeah right!). And the ending...don't even get me started. I was totally lost as to why the killers did what they did. Did the killers know each other? Were they in cahoots? Who knows? A reader shouldn't be so confused after slogging through 500 pages."
4,lousy ending,"This was a very good ride for most of the 500 pages. Well done, as the journalist follows the F.B.I. Authentically and factually grounded. This author just doesn't know how to sign off. This book ended and then it went on. Why? Connolly introduces the real killer without ever giving us a clue as to how or why. One of the most unsatisfying endings ever. We are led to expect more and then he dumps us."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This CD title offers a great mistake:It's the brand of the guitar, and NOT the good old boy Les Paul!If you wanna hear this god of the electric guitar you better buy the older stuff, and do not throw away your money for this faky record. Yo will not hear i.m.o.only few instrumentals, but the whole nasty stuff you here thousend and thousend times before by this guitar ""heroes"" of today.It's a waste of money to buy this record!"
4,More Tribute than Les,"This is much more of a tribute album than a Les Paul Album. That said, it is an absolutely stunning collection of songs, one better than the other, featuring a series of guitar virtuosos like Billy Gibbons(ZZ Top), Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, and Richie Sambora, all playing up a storm. Somewhere in between , Les Paul does a few tunes and fills in a few guitar riffs.Joss Stone continues to impress me with a great vocal on the opening cut. I got this CD as a gift, and would buy it as a gift to give to anyone who enjoys the sound of an electric guitar being played by the masters."
2,Non-Metallic = Plastic,"The good news is that water comes out of it.... That's about it.I tried to save $10 (and a trip) by buying this instead of one from my local home improvement store. Big mistake, it is totally plastic, cheap plastic. It very much reminds me of the chrome plated parts that came with model cars that I made as a kid, except the model's plastic was stronger. The spout twist in your hand. Water comes out slowly as the internal pathways are so small. Instructions totally worthless, they don't even describe what the extra parts are for.All around bad product, unless you really don't care how long it lasts."
5,Sworn to excellance,"This very helpful study guide is one of the most thought provoking and challenging books that i have seen in a long time. For those of us who need a review of the principles of grammers, How Grammer Works, is a must have. The books unique format systematically guides your brain along old forgotten paths provoking recall while simultaniously stimulating new learning. I am completely satisfied with this book. I am sure a beginner can greatly benefit from this work also. Thank you Amazon for making it available."
4,book was good for it's purpose,"I used the book for a class on how drugs affect the brain functioning. I recommend you have some prior knowledge on psychology and the functioning of the human brain, even though the book helps you through hard to understand processes of the brain functioning."
2,Too much $ to drip,The tea kettle is nice to look at...BUT...ours drips all over the place. Like others saidit also spits out water if you fill it too much.I would not buy this again.
2,Nice looking kettle - pity about the whistle,I agree with the comments regarding the poorly designed whistle on this kettle. I bought this brand because I have some nice pots and pans by Le Creuset. I never really considered that the whistle would have to be removed before pouring.... it is hard to detach and even harder to put back in. This kettle did not last long on my stovetop. It is now on display top of the cupboard.
5,another chef's wife!,I'm a chef's wife too and she nails it! Thank goodness we don't run a restaurant together but it is tough to be married to the chef. I'm lucky in that my husband does like to cook at home. I loved this book and recommend it to other chef wives - you're not crazy!
3,Why? Why? Why?,"WHY doesn't the album have OFFSPRING on it? OR better yet (and probably the only reason I wanted the soundtrack!) - Ace Frehleys (KISS), ""New York Groove"" (Most excellent oldie but goodie tune!)? Gee - I thought forsure these two would at least be on it, with NYG being No.1 !"
3,Great price,For the price the product isn't horrible but it's most definitely not something I will use long term. It's great for my Clinicals and taking to the hospital for a now but I will invest in a better one further into my program. You know what they say... You get what you pay for.
2,Need repair kit,"Was great the first 2 times until it went flat. There's a leak in the hem on the inside, didn't come w/ a repair kit. I purchased 2, hope the other one lasts longer. Should have come w/ at least a minimal repair kit."
3,Good While it Lasted,This lounger was comfortable and nicely designed. I have a few loungers and this was my favorite. Had some nice summer days relaxing on it. Unfortunately it broke near the end of the season. I may have been a little rough with it using it to make waves in the pool but I feel it should've held up. Had to toss it. Liked it so much I might get a new one though. Had to give it three stars for durability.
1,Lasted one day,"Very comfortable, but it didn't even make it to survive the first day!! it got deflated within the first two hours of smooth pool usage."
2,Tall People Beware,"I ordered 2 of these and I hate them both. I am 6'-1"" and was very uncomfortable in these loungers. My buddy is a few inches shorter and liked them better. If you have an indoor pool and just want to float around and read your book you will probably be fine. I live in Costa Rica and like to relax and take some sun while floating in the pool. If you are more like me try the Kelsyus Water Hammock. I love that one!!"
4,Nice pick for a soccer crazy child,"My son is happy with this watch, it's lightweight and easy to design and wear. I feel it is slightly tricky to separate the pieces (easy to snap them together, just not easy to get them apart), and the other thing I noticed is that it's listed as having a Lego soccer ball in the package with the mini figure, but ours didn't come with one.For the price, I think it's a great gift."
2,Didn't like it,"Not what I expected bought it for a 9 year's old, and this item its for a younger kid, the item should specify the age dor it"
2,LEGO Watch,Nice product. Very difficult to assemble. Instructions could use improving a great deal. Very difficult for children to assemble. Would not recommend this if there is no adult to assemble for you.
3,Not a must have.,"This is a good album if you're new to the ADF.Most tracks revamped move away from what the original ADF sound tried to convey. They got rid of Dr Das' bass in most of them. The voice and lyrics can be better appreciated in these versions but as a whole it lacks the instrumental achievement of the original recordings.Some classics have been severely tampered with actually achieving a pretty good re-version. Highlights are Tu Meri, Witness and Debris.Other remixes are enjoyable, but you can go to the original and hear a much richer and daring mix.I find it a bit pretentious, but it's a good attempt and makes some old versions even more enjoyable. So if you're an old ADF fan you can try this for a couple weeks and go back to Facts and Fiction and LOVE it for the amazing album it is."
5,surprisingly a very good film,"Shadow: Dead Riot is a gory, funny, violent, zombie filled film with a lot of martial arts. Not only is Shadow: Dead Riot a good film, it's one of those B-movies that you'll love to add to your collection. There's good acting, good plot, and what else our very own stars Erin Brown, Ruby LaRocca and Tony Todd. What else can you ask for. I recommend this film."
2,Not the same without Wayne Henderson,This is too funky of an album for me. Wayne Henderson is not on this album and the arrangements show it--lack of depth and original ideas in the music. The other reviews have not obviously heard some of the other Crusaders albums. I have been a fan of the Crusaders since 1973. If you are getting in the Crusaders I would suggest 2nd Crusade or Southern Knights.
4,Lost gem re discover,"Get this album, I most recently was going over my cd collection and just rediscover this lost classic. Cool tracks to listen are ""1000 times and Radio prayer line"". This is a cd that will grow onto you. My guess is why this cd never made it big was there was no room for rock airplay on the radio at the time due to all the over expose boy bands and pop stuff. Hey what a classic album title to go with that period."
5,It's About Time,"I must say that Wax Ecstatic was a minor letdown, but what a way to redeem yourself! I fell in love with ""1000 Times"" and ""New Pop Sunday"" from the start. I've got all three major releases, and this one is damned good. Not quite Rotting Pinata, but it's well worthwhile."
2,Stop overpricing old TV shows,$41.99 for the season when others are selling for $14? Are you smoking dope? This is an outrageously high price and not worth it. Bring out the series 5-6 on DVD!
2,Disappointing,Not having been familiar with the production ( or the related album ); but looking forward to a collection of John Denvers' best songs; I purchased the download. The arrangements were all different and the vocals did not sound at all like the John Denver I had always enjoyed. If you are looking for John Denvers' greatest hits; this isn't it.
5,Perfect,"I am a huge fan of the Robin Hood legend and I believe this retelling of the legend is one of the best films to date. Yet I wonder how successful the movie would have been without this amazing music. Michael Kamen knows how to perfectly capture the heroism of the Robin Hood legend. The themes are memorable, and the way he is able to tie in the music to the theme song, ""Everything I Do"", is very satisfying. In an era of non-thematic and blasé movie scores, Kamen shows what is possible using a large orchestra and beautiful themes while encapsulating the drama on screen."
4,Good,"Got this watch when it first came out here in hong kong, i dont know if thats the reason it cost so much (around 237usd). this watch is really cool, the numbers are large and you wont have trouble telling time, people love this watch they always ask me about it the only bad thing i have to say about this watch is that the leather strap tends to darken if you dont take care of it. get this watch so you know what time it is."
3,The fragile and funny (peculiar) 1%,"Caitlin Macy is a smart and savvy young writer, but in The Fundamentals of Play she strives for a tone that her material unfortunately just can't carry. The Great Gatsby in the internet age this is not. However, reading it, one hopes that soon Macy bangs out her version of Tender is the Night. I would love to read a great novel about the American marriage in the internet age."
1,Don't believe the hype....,Ms. Macy clearly is a talented writer. No doubt about that.Unfortunately this book reads like a Dawson's Creek episode. I see Tori Spelling in the role of Kate Goodenow....*shudder*
5,Best of Louis Jordan,"A must have! Especially for the track Saturday Night Fish Fry. Evey song is great, just LOVE that Louey Jordan."
3,"Review of ""best of Louis Jordan""","Supplier sent this item quickly and it arrived in good condition. But the music on the CD was pretty ordinary. It only had a few known tunes, and a number of relatively unknown tunes that didn't have much interest for me."
4,Interesting and objective look at Mexican culture & politics,"Traces Mexico through centuries of splendor and oppression. Great facts and figures, most of my Mexican friends didn't comprehend the full extent of de-population after the Spaniards arrived."
4,Nice lamps-Good Value,Came packed tight as a drum but put together I love them & the quality is nice for the price.
2,Works well until it cracks,"I loved this baking dish. It looks nice and cleans really well. After owning it for about a year, it cracked in half in a 400 deg. oven. Pretty disappointing."
3,Has a great main theme,I just bought this CD several days ago and I'm still listening to it. Ace's guitar theme sticks in my head all day and I never grow tired of it. This is a good-average soundtrack to have. (check out the Face/Off soundtrack!)
4,interesting book,"Actually it's not required for the class. However, I believe it can be very useful. The idea is super. Whoever interested in the building of your word power, you should get it."
4,Great but...,"It is a great book in fact, but be aware for what it calls 'advanced'. The vocabulary presented in this book is great for an academic student but almost useless for people who want to improve the day-by-day vocabulary. For those I'd recommend the less advanced books. The words you will find in this book will definitely help you in college but won't make a difference in your routine out of college.I'll give it four stars because the unclear description of the program fails to specify what I mentioned above."
3,Shelby has grown way beyond this,"I am a huge fan of Ms. Lynne, even though her recordings are not terribly consistent. This early disc does not really remind me in any way of the last several recordings she has done. It's clear that folks in Nashville just didn't know how to highlight her voice and bring out her potential. It's been wonderful to listen to her past few recordings, though Revelation Road is too viscerally cathartic.I bought this to fill out my collection of Shelby's work, but it's not likely to get much play in my rotation."
3,Help!!! Is this the 3rd edition?,I need to know if this is the 3rd edition published in 2007 or if this is a very old edition from 1988 as indicated when I check the website via kindle. I would much prefer to get this on my kindle but I cannot be sure. Can someone please help in how to tell? I have to have the 3rd edition from 2007 for a course.Thank you.
3,Discipline,"This book is okay... the way it's written, I'm just not enjoying reading it - but the information is fine. A lot of common sense stuff."
2,Just not for the real world,"I really liked this approach to discipline in theory, but it just dosen't cut it in the real world. I have a very headstrong toddler and he walked all over me with these approaches. I really like Is it a Big Problem or a Little Problem?, which I am currently reading. It has many more real-life solutions than the Discipline book did."
1,Never Received Book,I never received book and when I sent several email messages to Jeffrey at Quality7 requesting a refund he insisted that it sometimes takes over 30 days to get a book (my history with Amazon does NOT bear this out). Well it is now over 30 days and I still have not receiveed the book and I would very much appreciate receiving a credit against the original purchase.RegardsEd CikanekPS - I do not want to receive any more emails from Jeffrey at Quality7. All I want is my refund.
5,jetpackjunkie,"I own the vintage,30th,and ect,and this is by far the best looking the vintage side by side with the trilogy looks underfed and the head on the vintage is small[helmet comes off] only thing that the vintage has on trilogy is painted weapons [with weaker plastic]and wookie braids look to be tied in a orange color but the trilogy has it beat in helmet,antenna, jet pack and I like the shoulder pads even though they enable movability they look better. cape well i like the stripe but it should of been sewn on not painted.when first buying the 2 i thought the vintage would be better but after seeing them side by side the trilogy reamains the best."
5,the Best health book I’ve read so far,"I have read Mr. Al-Angary’s book, and I must say it’s an excellent guide to lose weight. Its a very informative book on the foods we eat and its affects on our health and well being. I recommend it to all interested in eating healthy and those who need to shed their extra kilos.The way the author takes you in simple to follow steps, you feel as if he is sitting in front of you telling you how you can really do it.Both my self and my elder daughter worked on his “system” and within two weeks I lost 16 pounds while she lost 22 pounds. Amazing!It is the Best health book I’ve read so far, Kudos to Mr Mazen."
1,IMO ONE OF REBA'S WORSTS!,"There are only two songs worth it on this CD. The title track and ""You Lie"", both number one hits for Reba. The rest is just pop mish mash filter. The songs are ugly...the melodies are horrible and the production is just suited to those who don't like traditional country. I gave this CD away to a used CD place. Yuck! (This is my opinion only!)"
1,WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE!!!!,"Reba started going downhill in 1988 when she switched musical genres. Things quickly went from bad to worse with this release. I agree with the reviews that say this is one of her low points. The only song I like on here is ""Rumor Has It"" because it is a sad reminder of what can no longer be with Reba McEntire.....great traditionalism. The other single ""You Lie"" shows off her range but I hate the song. THe other songs are just awful with ""Fancy"" being the worst of the lot!! Whatever possessed Reba to cover this one I'll never know."
5,A very mature outing,Rumor Has It had been certified selling 3 million on 03/24/99. What can I say I love this CD. This is the first CD I bought of Reba's after having seen the video Fancy in 1993. Fancy was the first song I played then I skipped to You Lie and loved that song even more. I took a listen to the rest and started buying every CD out there.
1,I SHOULD HAVE BEEN WARNED BY THE COVER.....,"When I first heard the title track to this, before I bought the CD, I thought, Wow....Reba has come back to singing ""real"" country music. So I went out and bought the CD. Then the sad reality set in. This CD is no more country than a yankee raised in the Bronx of New York. Worst still, the songs (except for the title track) are simply terrible. When I saw the cover of the CD with Reba all decked out sophisticatedly in a hat a red flag should immediately have gone up and stopped me from wasting my money on a poor excuse for country music."
2,Not the best book in the world,I think that the book could have been better. There was to much in it to understand and it was really confusing. I really didn't get what they were saying in it. This girl went through all the seasons telling what happend and what the major things were like the smeels of the things around her and things like that. I think that it would of been better if i was older to understand it.
2,The Big Time Review,The book is about a boy that lived on a farm out in the country. He tells about how they lived through all four seasons of the year and how they spent their time. Then he also tells how they got ready for each month like storing things for winter and things like that.I liked the story becuase it tells about his life and how he lived through rough times. Then also he tells about his family and his uncles that live with him and about when they were young and their marital lifes.I did not like this book so much becuase he was reapting himself over and over again. It was also boring becuase they never gave really good details.
3,Too slow for a 9-year-old,"My wife and have been delighted reading other Gary Paulsen books to our 9-year-old. While ""The Winter Room"" was satisfied for us adults, our son was quickly bored. Paulsen does a wonderful job activating all five senses as he creates his scenes, and his parents were being drawn into the story and historical setting. But our boy needs a good deal more action. My guess is that a girl may find it more interesting."
2,One of his worst!,"Pulsen is one of my favorite authors, and I often enjoy reading his work. I have to say this was not a piece that I liked at all. It was boring and it lacked the amazing detail that I have come to expect from Paulsen."
3,Winter Room wasn't that interesting,"I didn't really like the ""Winter Room"" because it wasn't that interesting and it didn't have that much detail. Gary Paulsen's books usually have a lot of detail but I didn't think this book has that much detail. I will recommend this book to a person who doesn't like to read long books. This book wasn't really boring but if you read it you might like it. The book was sort of funny and disgusting."
2,Ketogenic diets,"My review of this book may be negative as a result of what I thought it was going to be about. I have recently been diagnosed with Epilepsy and am in the last quarter of my life. This book, if I am understanding it correctly is for the treatment of children, not adults. Had I realized this, I would not have spent my money on it. Guess I have to take part responsibility for the dissatisfaction for not correctly reading what it what to be all about. I can't blame the author on that."
4,Great deal,"We bought these dolls at a great bargain price. They are very durable and the dresses are very nice quality. My 3 yr old and 8 yr old were entertained for hours with these dolls. Nice enough to give as gifts for any girl that likes to play with dolls. The doll comes with a book, doll stand and crown for your little girl."
4,Unique and entertaining,While the author has a wild and wonderful imagination he still needs to work on his prose. The characters were fun and the plot was unusual. It shows how crazy the world can be and how the media can effectively create a star. This book is a fun and interesting read - I look forward to seeing where Steve Martin Cohen's career goes from here.
4,The Return Of The Thin White Duke Jr.,"There was a fair amount of hype surrounding young Charlie Sexton prior to the release of this, his debut album. The teenage guitar slinging wunderkind from Austin, Texas was rumored to be tight not only with The Fabulous Thunderbirds but with the great Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, sharing many a stage with both bands. Based on those credentials, it came as no small surprise that Sexton's voice and sound on ""Pictures For Pleasure"" were so similar to that of David Bowie. ""Beat's So Lonely"" was an MTV staple for a while, but the second single ""Impressed"" left me feeling just that, not only about the song itself, but the entire album. Quite a debut for a kid barely old enough to drive."
4,"His first release, his best release !","I remember back in 1986 listening the new artists of the new wave's 2nd generation: Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Charly Sexton. Finally i found both CD's and let me tell you. First time a heard Pictures for pleasure, ai got dissapointed, because it wasn't the same thing i heard when i bought the sigle remix for Beat's so lonely, but in time, 2 months later, it was the song i was listening the less. Charly sexton has the Billly Idol power with an extraordinary vooice (i mean, for being a 16 y.o. boy), and the richness of each song. My favourites: Tell Me, Impressed, Beat's so lonely. It's a must have if you like 80's new wave, and most of it, if you like Billy Idol"
5,WOOD BIRD PERCH,"Vet advised not to get it with gravel, not good for birds feet, so I got plain wood perch, which is hard to find, but my cockatiel loves it. I received fast delivery, everything was fine, nothing damaged. Would buy again thru seller."
5,If you write HTML. You Need this Book!,"Even though Adobe stupidly opted to stop developing and supporting GoLive HTML authoring application, there is a ton of useful HTML information in this book even if you don't use it to apply to using the GoLive application. Ms. Shadovitz is a brilliant writer and this 1500 page book is filled with useful information that will never go out of date as long as HTML is alive and well. Thank you Deborah!"
4,Nearly as good as Zelnorm,I took prescription Zelnorm for a little over a year before trying this product. I've been using this product for 4 months now and have found it to be nearly as effective as Zelnorm for managing IBS (w/constipation) - and it's less expensive too. I've tried both the capsules and the chewable tablets and have found them to work about the same. Personally I prefer the capsules because I don't like the taste of the chewable tablets. I plan to continue using this product.
1,These did not work at all...in fact they made me worse,"I tried these for mild stomach issues only in the morning and it made it worse and then my stomach was upset throughout the day. There were a lot of great reviews so it must work for a lot of people, I just wasn't one of the lucky ones."
1,terrible!,"I was very excited to see so many great reviews on this product and having problems I decided to try it. At first I thought something was happening, after about 2 weeks I realized I was going to the bathroom less frequently and became very constipated. When I called DA website I was told to continue another two weeks to see because my body was readjusting. Well its been 21 days and I can not continue. I am in pain! IF you have problems with constipation I would not recommend this."
4,"Very good probiotic, Reasonable price - Great for IBS suffers, reaches intestines where it is needed",I have used Digestive Advantage Lactose successfully for quite a while along with standard and expensive probiotics and for this reason was anxious to also try this product as a substitute for all the expensive probiotics I was using but not seeing much improvement. This seems to be doing a great job. The capsules are coated so that they survive the acids in the stomach and pass into the intestines where they exist as the normal probiotics needed to maintain normal bowel health. Buying through Amazon I have convenience and save money.
5,"Digestive Advantage Intensive Bowel Support, 96 Counts Capsules","I was suffering for the past several months with bloating and gas pain. It has happened to me every so often but this last time it has last for a few months. I tried everything and still had the pain and bloating. I gave this a try (purchased locally) to see if this would help. The first few days I took one and just a bit of relief so I increased it to 2 a day. Let me tell you, this has helped me tremendously. I was surprised as it said give it time but within the first week I had a remarkable difference. I am thrilled that I found this and it enables me to eat mostly anything now although I am still careful."
5,Keeps me regular,Every now and then I try to wean myself off of this but I always end up coming back to it. It's a natural and free of side effects way to deal with IBS. I now have it on automatic subscription with Amazon.
3,Maybe it works,I'm not sure the product has helped me at all. I have chronic colitis and I've seen no improvement after taking the product for over a month now.
5,IBS - Symtoms relieved,This is the only thing that has helped relieve the painful bowel cramping and pain that my daughter has suffered from for four years. She has been using for three months (she started with the tablets but likes the caplets better) and has only two minor bouts of pain after four years of doctors visits and chronic pain.She would recommend it to any one suffering the same symptoms.
4,Good product work for me,"I am satisfy with the result I got from this product. Befoer I have very Irritable bowel and diarrhea with alot of gas specifaclly if I drink milk or I eat bean.Now, I have very less Irritable bowel Symptoms and diarrhea. It took around two weeks for me to work. Still I have a lot of gas. The Symptoms will return if I stop taking the bills for several days (but much less than before I use this product)."
5,IBS Caplets are THE BEST,For the first time in my life I can look forward to a normal life without constant bathroom searching. No more stomach distress/cramps. I am thrilled with this product. I just make sure to take it at the same time every day so it works very well for me.THANK YOU GANADEN FOR DIGESTIVE ADVANTAGE IBS !!!
1,Overly simplistic right wing views,I found the information on this DVD presented at an extremely superficial and overly simplistic level. I expected a more thorough discussion of the issues - I didn't agree with the views presented by Mr Meyer but I did expect him to describe his views in a deeper and more detailed manner. Suitable for viewers who are looking for a simplistic overview of American right wing opinion.
1,Forget It.,"Not knowing exactly what Blum hinge to use, I went to the Blum US site. I found this site totally devoid of any information for the prospective customer. It's like they don't want to share that information. They don't deserve to be in business."
5,Work as expected,This is a great deal. One hundred CDs in one package. I do a lot of file sharing and this is a fantastic deal and cuts out the need for extra space for jewel cases. The discs burn fast and without errors.
2,"OK for VERY short term use, not more",I had a batch of these. Don't bother to burn mp3's on them. They last for about a month (of occasional play). It's OK if you want to temporarily store data. That's about it.
4,Good price; quick shipment,"These are a recognizable, quality brand name, offered at a reasonable price, and shipped promptly. Very satisfied, and will likely buy more!"
2,Couldn't wait to replace it!,"I bought this camera shortly after it first came out and since than, it always took terrible night pictures so, taking pictures of outside lit-up decorations around the holidays was very disappointing. However, this camera does take decent daytime pictures ""if that is all you want to take"". I also don't like the small screen since I love showing my pictures off or viewing them as soon as I take them so that being said, consider a bigger screen for immediate viewing or show and tell. Furthermore, I noticed in some reviews from other buyers who bought this exact camera only paying $50 and I personally feel that, that's all this camera was ever worth... I only wish that I paid that little.At any rate, if you want a wonderful camera... consider a Samsung SL35 10.2MP Digital Camera - You will love it!"
5,Best bouncer to stimulate and soothe your active baby!,"Out of several bouncers I've tested in stores and bought, this is by the far the best and so worth the money. My son loves to bounce himself and it turned out to be the one bouncer he didn't protest going into. When he's tired, the seat cradles and comforts him for long naps. Besides being practical and stylish, I appreciate it's portability. You can't go wrong with this seat."
5,Teriffic addition,"Using with our first child who is two months old. She liked it right away and takes naps in it and sits in it while we have dinner. Simple, elegant design. Expensive, but worth it."
4,Classic Classy 80s Country,I am a big fan of Chris Hillman's post Byrds' career. The Desert Rose Band great instrumental prowess and fine country lyrics are hard to beat. Songs rang from ballads to up tempo fare approaching western swing. A great listen for anyone looking for 80s country music of just good music generally.
4,Short-changed?,"It's an excellent album, but did you USA-ians know that you're being short-changed?In the UK this CD is not ""A Dozen"", but ""Sixteen Roses""!!!If I were you I'd ask WEA/Atlantic/Curb what their justification for this is.(On the other hand, we Brits get charged exorbitant CD prices, so I guess it's swings and roundabouts). Come back Napster, all is forgiven."
2,Cheap as chips...,"Personally I didn't enjoy this book and after a couple of readings my children (2 & 4) grew tired of it too. I've read other reviews and the positives I took away were that the book seemed to help some children with separation anxiety - I cannot say that I can make the same connection.Nonetheless, the cost of the book is minimal, so if nothing else it's a good library filler."
3,"If you love Keely, buy it! Good music, but cluttered.","Keely Smith and Count Basie. How can it miss? This oddity does miss because, for some reason, the producers saw fit to leave the stilted, trite, long winded plugs for the National Guard in with these wonderful musical numbers. Keely and the Count try their hand at the phoniest ad libbed interviews you ever heard. You could search through and delete them, but they are between every number. The music however, is top notch, and I believe the only recording of these two immortals together. The fidelity is strictly early sixties FM monaural, not nearly recording studio calibre. The biggest insult is the dated 1949 hair-do photo of Keely Smith on the cover of this 1963 album. Change the cover, edit out Martin What's-his-name announcer, and turn up the treble and bass, and you've got a classic!"
1,Sammy Franco heavy bag training,"Save your money, I can’t believe I wasted $30.00 on this DVD. You can get better information off UTube. Video looks like it was filmed with a phone. Basically, you watch a few guys hit a bag, very little technique. If you’re expecting a training or workout DVD than this is not it. The only thing I should have punched was myself in the face for buying it."
3,plate,"I thought it was chrome, but it was white. But for $5.00, I got what I paid for. The seller packed it very nice. No complaints."
3,Basic RE and conservation information,This book is for the novice. Do not buy if you have purchased - Smart Power: An Urban Guide To Renewable energy and efficiency... they are almost identical.
2,Good book for novice C programmers,"I'd recommend this book for novice C programmers, people with two or less years of coding experience. However, this 1989 book focuses on pre-ANSI C, so the novice would need to be guided by someone that knows the history of C. Some of his statements are false when applied to ANSI C with prototypes (e.g., p.139, it _is_ possible to pass a char argument, if there is a function prototype). I read through and did the problems in this slim book in about three hours. It does have a few nuggets of value, and introduced me to a bug I'd not seen before, the reverse of the ""= for =="" bug:while( (x == fgetc(f)) != EOF )"
4,"Obviously a must have, but maybe just to keep.","This book is a must have and you must have read it at least once. Then again, I have read it once and will only use it as a quick reference. For more elaborate information I will look for (my) other books that will tell the same in a more fluent and up to date style (read: Expert C Programming).This book shows all the pitfalls in a convenient compact volume.If you are NOT a sloppy programmer you might dislike many of the more obvious examples . . then again, you might do some maintenance on ""someone else's code""."
1,A bit disappointed,"Maybe I didn't read as far as I could have before downloading. I didn't expect it to be so short. Plus, I didn't like it well enough to download any more. It was free, however, so no problem."
3,"Decent, but ultimately uninspiring","I picked up this book based on a glowing recommendation from a review blog. It's a decent enough story, very Stephen King-ish, and while I was slightly intrigued, ultimately there wasn't enough here to make want to go on to the rest of the series. Maybe it just seemed a bit TOO King-ish, meaning, I didn't feel like I was reading anything unique or new.In terms of the writing itself, Burke is certainly more proficient than many other indie authors out there in his language use, though there are many instances of overwrought description for the sake of throwing in description that were a little annoying as a reader. A different editor may have been able to help him streamline the text a bit more."
3,The Turtle Boy,It was OK. I probably would not read the rest of the series. It took me a while to get through it.
3,Good,"Good but not great, enjoyed the book, I thought it left you hanging at the end. I gave it a three"
4,Surprisingly Refreshing,The Turtle Boy is a surpringly refreshing and entertaining story that will keep you glued to this book. Once you start reading you will not wish to put it down. I only wished the story was longer and that it woudn't end.
2,weird tale of woe,"I was told this was a young adult book, but that older folks would enjoy the twists and turns of the tale. There were indeed twists and turns, but overall, I just thought it was strange. It's a quick read, so the writing style was enjoyable, just the story itself was crafted I kind of wondered why someone recommended it in the first place. Maybe it just doesn't match my taste. I was hoping a ""Twilight Zone"" sort of creepy odd, but just got the odd part.."
3,Weirdly Attractive,"Not my favorite type of story. Too darkly portrayed and not that well written. But, to the author's credit I had to finish the book."
3,POTENTIAL HERE,"Burke's THE TURTLE BOY is the first novella leading to a book series about eleven year old Timmy Quinn. Kind of a frighteningly simple story that leads to the fantasy edges. The potential is here for a nice series, but the story slipped a little away from the author toward the end of the story. But hey, try it...Free!!"
5,Turtle Boy,"I love, love, loved this book. It seems sweet and innocent but it's not and I was pleasantly surprised by the story. I can't wait to read more Timmy Quinn stories !!"
5,spooky,"really good a bit short but very spooky it kept my interest , am looking forward to future works by Kealan Burke"
1,God Awful,Couldnt believe the ratings on this book..... I thought it was a lousy read and still do.... Taught me not to always go with the ratings.
3,OK,This just wasn't my type of book. I'm sure it appeals more to others. I liked the surprise ending though.
5,Atmospheric,"Burke is creating his own genre with this book. A fantastic macabre short story to sink your teeth in to, with fresh writing and a pace that builds to a great finish. Very atmospheric and I liked the slow building of utter dread. It's something that a lot of writers overdo to the point where it becomes unintentionally funny, but that didn't happen here."
3,Turtle Boy,Quick read. Short Story. Reminded me of when I read Goosebumps to my boys! I liked the characters. I can see where they could go on with these stories.
4,Spooky,"I had not even heard of this author before and started reading, not knowing what to expect. The book was well written and really reminded me of Stephen King books. It was gripping and the characters were believable. The end wasn't great but after reading this book I have downloaded another 2 and am currently reading one called KIN that is excellent and I would highly recommend it."
3,The Turtle Boy,"I liked the story, weird twist, didn't see that coming. And I had no idea it was so short. I would like to read full novels by this author."
2,Not worth the short time it took to,"Did not care for this book at all. It was VERY short and I didn't understand what was really going on, even after I finished it. I don't want to ruin the ending, but the whole point about the main character being ""special"" bothered me. The other two children apparently had that same special ability. What's that all about? The story never really brought me in, and this was one of the few stories I felt I had wasted my time reading. If it was longer, I probably would have given it one star instead of two. In that regard, I'm glad it was so short."
3,Imagination or Reality,"I couldn't put down this novella. It was the perfect blend of creepy realistic horror to read on a rainy fall night!I was able to visualize the world through the eyes of an eleven year old as he and his friend look for entertainment on a summer's day. When they discover a creepy boy hanging out at their fishing pond, the perfect lazy summer day turns into a dark nightmare. Is the nightmare a boy's imagination or reality?"
1,useless,"This has been the worst purchase I have made. I did not find anything new at all in this book. The back cover promises the world but inside there is nothing at all. Carburetors are covered in one 5 line paragraph in the whole book without mention of who, how, what size, what brand NOTHING zero zip NADAAt one point he say that he wont recomend anything because some companies from his last book went under two years after its release Well thats great no recomendations SO why do I have a book with no suggestions. He says some heads are poor quality and are to be avoided uhhh which heads? what number or code, he DOESNT SAY. I really regret buying this book and if I must say something nice then I suggest you give it to a clueless person who will read it only for entertainment."
5,Excellent guide to overcoming Hearing Loss fears!,"This book covers so many topics in such an empathetical way -- extremely well written. This book will help you if you know you are losing your hearing and are downright scared/nervous about seeking help. Understanding the hearing loss is important. This is not just for the person who has suffered hearing lose and needs help, but also for the rest of the family who needs to support and help as well. This book really cannot go recommended enough!Some of the greatest scientists/audiologists that there is have come together to share in good basic English to help. Exceptional!!"
3,snowthrower,"This book has valuable information. However, it does need to be updated. It is now 10 years old and does not list the newer models.Some of the information has changed. Time for an 4th edition."
5,Exactly what I expected!,"Exactly what I expected! Great product, came with all the hardware, and matches the one I have, as I hoped."
3,hypno mow or never,this whas the firts time i think on of his book whas not so good as the other onesis start good but then he goos of with to mutch of his own ideersthen he start to revieuw things that has not so mutch valueas his ohther books
3,"Weak Dialog, Weak Story Line","This is a review of the Audio Cassette. I was pretty disappointed with this audio book. It sounded as if critical components of the story had ended up on the editing floor. I had trouble following things. For example, how exactly was Ghazi utilizing sub-space to reach his audience when everything pointed to radio waves being used? The actor who played Ghazi carried the story; he was quite good and ""into"" his part. Takai sounded wooden at times. At one point the background sound affects and the music actually drowned out the Sulu's voice! I found it a very mediochre audio book, and if it hadn't been for Ghazi it would have gotten a 2 star."
4,Good,"Good stuff, I love the easy pour container, when i'am done can use it to put brass in. Pretty cheap to compaired to other stores!!"
2,Cat lover just not loving this book,"This book wasn't as funny as I'd hoped. There are a few good one-liners inside, but overall it was very repetative. It does basically just state that cats are more intelligent than humans, and that we live to serve them, and they only stick around because we provide for them--that they're just not that into us. There were even a few parts that were very weird and sexual--like one woman saying that her cat liked to nibble on her panties, but not while they were on her, and she desired her cat to gnaw on them while she was wearing them...it was very odd! I understand that it's also supposed to be along the same lines as ""He's Just Not That Into You"" but some of the write-ins and answers seemed more like they were about men and women...which made them less funny, because they were using the word cat. As a cat-lover, I expected more good humor about cats, and I was left wanting. I just wasn't that into this book."
5,Totally Absorbing,"I wanted to get some experience with developing web based training. I didn't have much Dreamweaver experience, so I appreciated the overview chapter on Dreamweaver.I really liked the hands on approach to the book, particularly the abundance of examples to work with on the CD. Doyle did a great job of walking through creating tests step by step so I never felt lost.I didnt get into the database stuff at the end of the book, so I can't speak to that material. But everything else was very helpful!!"
2,So Close Yet So Far,"Beautiful color a little more on the muted green side than a true blue. It is very attractive and a nice size. But, it is not made in France like the main cookware."
1,Broke after 3 months!!,"I purchased this watch in October of 2010. It looks great and my husband loves it. HOWEVER It broke after only 3 months! It started to keep the wrong time. Amazon.com is still giving me the ""run around"" and won't agree to exhange it or return it!Don't buy Cartier watches from Amazon. It is too risky for the price!!!"
4,Good book for novice users,"I found this to be the most practical book for those who are 'getting started'. The book does not assume too much about what the reader knows and makes no claim at being a complete reference; however, as a complete overview, it works fairly well and I couldn't find too many books that did this. I am a ColdFusion user and wish to create richer applications with Flash Remoting. I know almost nothing about ActionScript, and the book does a great job of explaining each of the components and how they all fit together. If the book presumes anything, it might expect you to already be familiar with Flash MX"
1,Disappointment,"Another reviewer here says that they got more serious about their music on this album. If that's what it was, they should have just kept playing unserious music. Their other three albums are outstanding. 5 stars for both the studio releases. But the change here was just not good for them. The talented slap of Wag is totally absent. There is a lack of the jazzing sounding guitar tracks found in their previous work. Also, these songs are way to polished. Their other albums offered much more diverse and raw sound. As a hugh fan, it greatly disappointed me and still years later, I can't find myself enjoying more than bits and pieces of this one. The fun found in the other albums is just missing."
5,does what its made for,great for taking out that weird screw in the back of games. plus a magnetic pull for the screwdriver to hold on to the screw.....awesome!
1,DOESN'T WORK SAVE Your Money!!!,"Okay, yes It kills On contact, the ants. Spiders? NO. they get up and walk away. Any other bugs? NO. they get up and walk away too. And It DOES NOT last, and it does Not prevent ants from Coming in your home. You basically have to keep spraying and spraying. 5 Minutes later , the ants are Back! Save Your Money. I Bought this becuase I have cats and I am concerned with pesticides around them. Says its safe. It has a strong odor. Im not so sure. The fact that I Have to keep spraying and spraying upsets me! Its Like fighting a Losing battle with this stuff. Dont buy this stuff.. it doesnt work. At Least Not as far as Keeping the ants away for longer than 5 minutes."
4,killed ants on contact,I was rather skeptical of Orange Guard but I try to use chemicals as little as possible. I purchased this product to use on sugar ants and small household ants that were showing up around my cats food bowl. This product kills ant instantly on contact. It has a very strong smell which is rather pleasant in small doses. The downside is the lack of a residual effect. It does not seem to prevent ants from coming back for very long. I suggest you use this spray for immediate control of present insects especially in sensitive areas such as around pet food bowls but you may need something with a more long lasting effect for reoccurring problems.
2,Forget It Unless You Take The Old Testament Literally,"Yancey is a very good writer; however, his valiant attempts to explain the ""unfairness,"" ""silence"" and ""hidden"" nature of God are not convincing, and, in fact, raised more questions than they answered. Would have to agree with the reviewer who suggested that one look to the East for answers to these questions. The Bhagavad Gita provides more logical answers with less contortions in logic and reasoning."
5,Touched my heart,The book addresses real human feelings and complex questions that have and will continue bothering humanity. The author comes across as honest and humbly supports his views with biblical references.The book doesn't give absolute answers. Instead it presents a Christian view of the situation without imposing the author's view on the reader.The content is food for thought for Christians and no Christians. Readers are definitely enriched regardless of the level of impact on their heart because the book talks to the heart rather than the head.I'd read it again
5,Happy customer,Pleased with the shipping speed and item. Wow--it can hold lots of photos! I will need to start changing my camera setting to higher pixels for better quality photos!
5,Sandisk 1GB Xd Picture Card Type H,"Worked great for our Fuji Finepix 3800 camera. Initial confusion over unlisted compatibility for our camera model was complicated further by responses from both Olympus and Fuji representatives in our attempts to determine whether it was necessary to purchase a picture card with the Fuji label. However, the Olympus labeled one that we received worked reliably and had we known that particular detail in advance we could have taken advantage of a lower price from a local retailer. Lesson learned..."
5,Picture Perfect,I'm Very satified with my purchase. I bought it 1 1/2 years ago. It has more than enough memory for the above average household use.
2,Poor Quality,"The item # 753 1/3 that arrived is not the same as the previous incarnation of the same item number. The file material is noticibly thinner. I'm all for saving the trees. However, we have a representation problem here. Pendaflex should have changed the item number to reflect that is different from the original 753 1/3. I will not order this product again. The box the folders were in burst during shipment and a number of the files tabs got crumpled. Anybody who wants a strong folder that will hold up to reasonable wear and tear should order the heavy weight folders from Staples."
4,One of her favorite stuffed animals,"My parents bought this for my daughter last Christmas, and she still loves it. It was as tall as she was last year, so she was adorable at Christmas hugging it and lugging it around the house. Now that she is older, she still loves playing with it and it is easier for her to manipulate.One reason they bought the penguin was due to her love of the movie ""Happy Feet"". One of her favorite things to do is lie on the floor with her penguin while watching the movie. I don't see much educational value other than supporting (or spurring) an interest in penguins."
2,Very disappointed!,"Clarin's Self Tanning instant Gel: It rubbes off and stainend my cloth.I have fair skin and applied the Gel 4 times, but only got a little tan. Very disappointing, specially for such an expensive product.Marla"
1,clarins self tanning gel,paid apprx $40.00 for this product. the color was fine but no better than the $10.00 products. would not purchase again.
4,Best I've used,"I'm extremely pale but I also have a pink undertone in my arms, legs and face. All I've wanted to do is hide the pink tones in my skin. I've tried so many different sunless tanners and I haven't liked any. I just got this tonight and it is perfect for me.It darkened my skin JUST enough to hide the pink tones and give me a tan glow (1 coat). It's not orange. The initial smell is good but, like all others it turns to that awful self tanning smell. Oh and it doesn't streak!But you know what, I can put up with that smell until I shower if it means I finally have the color I want.The price is a little steep, so I guess it's best to use sparingly, unless you have money like that :)So over all, it does what it says it will. It just turns a little smelly and it's kinda pricey."
5,Couldn't love it more!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel. There isn't much in a tube but (don't judge me!)...I just buy it to use on my face and do the tanning bed for my body. I cover my face in the tanning bed so I don't get wrinkles on my face! People never know that I have a ""real"" tan on the body and a ""fake"" tan on the face, as they blend perfectly. I will NEVER use anything different. I don't know why somebody says not to use it if you have acne? The formula is a gel and lightweight. I get acne occasionally and this does not add to it or aggravate it. The gel is smooth, perfect color,and the color is easily buildable over a few applications. Worth the money. Oh, and I don't find the smell to be offensive at all..I apply it before bed and never see any color on my pillowcase. Enjoy!"
4,Really good,"This is my first self tanning product. It is perfect, except that it is a little sticky. I apply before going to bed so I don't walk around felling sticky. It does a great job, face and body."
1,Yawn.,"I tried to plow through this book. I really did. The premise of the book is actually really cool. It is why I bought it in the first place. It's just that the execution is very poor. The characters aren't believable, the plot is pretty much boilerplate for a thriller. If you are still interested wait until you find it in paperback at a garage sale."
3,"So far, so good.","I recently bought a fixer-upper house and needed to replace the unusable kitchen faucet. But in a few months I'll be gutting and renovating the kitchen, so I didn't want to spend much on my temporary fix. So I bought this . . . the cheapest faucet I could find. It's entirely made of plastic. I installed it 5 days ago and it doesn't leak, so I'm perfectly happy with it so far. If you want to see a photo of it installed, check out my home renovation blog, Money Pit DC. I have no idea how long the thing will last. But so far, so good."
3,Hysteria,This was a fun movie to watch. Love Maggie Gyllenhaal as usual. Can't believe this is a based on actual events. Yikes!
5,Hysteria,Hysteria is a charming little movie. It is funny and smart. And the fact that it is loosely based in fact makes all the more enjoyable.
5,Charming!,"Hysteria is truly one of the most adorable, most charming movies I have ever seen! Hugh Dancy is absolutely engaging and precious, and I think this is Maggie Gyllenhaal's most stunning role to date. Her British accent is spot on. All of the actors were magnificent, and the subject matter and story line were totally laugh-out-loud hilarious. I can't wait to watch it again!"
3,Not so Hysterical,"I chose to order this movie as the previews had a promise of something much more 'Wilder' than the actual movie.The beginning is quite interesting but almost halfway through the movie it gets very dull and too 'coldly dramatic'.Hugh Dancy plays his part quite well I might add but the Gyllenhaal is not the right actress for this movie, somehow it appears to be such that she is more concerned with her pose than with playing the part.However, expectations not met all the way."
5,A must see movie for women,This is the most hilarious - based on true facts - story that I have ever watched. It is actually more for women to watch but really fun if you watched it with a partner. I hate to say that I really had to watch it twice to get everything that it was about. But it was very good.
3,ok film,"a bit of fluff, ok for the style. 3 stars is all this title is worth. good luck with this one"
4,Adult humor,"Hysteria is a funny, very good story. I thought it was good ADULT entertainment but certainly not for kids. ."
3,History of hysteria 3 1/2 stars,"Entertaining movie of an odd subject on the history of hysteria and it ""treatments"" of the day. Strong performances through an average movie. Suggested watch if your inclined to like the subject and wanting an interesting portrayal into the times that brought women's issues into the forefront. 3 1/2 stars"
4,Thank You Amazon,Thank you Guys for this. When I first looked for this album.....shock!! Horror !! NO Hanz Zimmer tracks. I was devistated. The plinky little playground tunes make this album. Now they are here I can by my album and be happy that the tape can now be replaced and I can once again skip around like a fool to these fab tunes.
4,True Romance,"I bought the cd for the theme song ""You're so Cool."" It's a catchy instumental piece by Zimmer that I couldn't find anywhere else. The rest of the album is worth a listen."
3,Trying to find SONG from the movie TRUE ROMANCE,"Hi, I have the soundtrack.. but I am trying to find out the name of the like RAP song that was playing in the beginning when Drexl Spivy shot Samuel Jackson when he was picking up the cocaine? It was a rap song and it was really good.I could be wrong what scene but there was like a hard core rap song that was playing in the back ground. If somone knows can you let me know what song that was. I know its a long shot but I thought I would try.Thanks in advance."
4,This excellent book is the one the movie is based on,"I enjoyed this excellent, easy to read book of Dorothy Dandridge's careet. The pages of information about the movie stars who played Dorothy Dandridge, Otto Preminger and Earl Mills were outstanding. I could have kept reading forever."
1,a confused man,"i read this book and being a relative of dotty's i found this book to be a fairy tale of the authors own imagination, he wrote about things in this book that he couldn't have possibly known, like about her wedding night and her alleged rape, was he under the bed how, did he know that she had bruises smarting? and all these carefree stories of dotty playing and riding bikes, this woman worked since she was three she didn't have time to be a kid and ride bikes, and futhermore dotty was a professional, she would not have gotten involved with this man whom she viewed to be just a little to solicitous, and struck her as wimpy, this book is no better than her ghost written memoir which she wrote when she was depressed and made up a lot of things that didn't happen and the co author also added things that weren't true either i am tired of dotty being exploited, the best bio is by donald bogle but he falls short too because he is obviously too much in love with his subject to be objective"
1,"Cheap, Misleading and Wasted money","First of all... let me say that i have already reviewed this item before and the review is missing. I bought this in 2005 as a valentine's day present for my wife. what we ended up getting was a very cheap looking bracelet in which one of the diamonds was missing. the clasp is very difficult to get on, and so far we have lost 3 diamonds from the chain. Please do not waste your money on this item.The photo does make it look brilliant. but there have been two separate and unrelated jewelry purchases that i have made through amazon, and all i can say is,... i will NEVER buy jewelry online AGAIN!i do think amazon has other great products... jewelry is not one of them."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The Belkin F8Z130 Clear Acrylic Case with Carabiner Clip is poorly designed with cheap materials. The Acrylic case split across the top on the first day and the Carabiner Clip broke a week later. I would not suggest this product to anyone.
3,Works fine until back case flies out,"I had the item for about 3 months. I liked everything about the case but the back case seems to fly out if you actually use the carabiner clip which results with your Nano on the street. Finally, I lost the back case and couldn't find it this time. If you don't use the clip then I think you will be alright as I only had the issue when using the clip to attach to a belt or a bag hence the 3 star rating. I am going totry out the ExtremeMac case next and write a review to see if it works better."
2,could be improved....in fact needs major work,"Protection wise it is fine. Design, needs some work.On off switch openeing could be slightly larger,and clip attached to plastic, not too reassuring. Easy to break.could be reinforced."
1,Does not work with iPod Nano 4GB!,This case would not close with my nano 4GB. The spec should clearly state that it is only intended to work with thinner ipods.
3,Disappointing,"Although this text has its merits, it is annoying to use for several reasons: 1)the audio sections are not all included on the student CD; 2)the text doesn't indicate the track number for recorded segments; 3) the irritating introductory music is repeated for each track. Perhaps the series has potential, but it needs refining."
2,Duplications,a Celebration of Music- this contains music that is on DVR that I have. It was listed as new 2012so I thought it would all be new.I would like to have known what it contained and what yearit was made This way you avoid of buying something you already have.This happened to me before. I did wonder about the price being cheap for a 2012 DVRPurchased at Amazon
3,Lacking Something,I LOVE most MHC books - they are some of the best I have ever read but this one just was not quite there. It was a decent book that held my attention but it just did not have the usual MHC pizzaz. I hate to sound vague but when you read it you will know what I mean.
1,This may not be Oprah's book club,"but for the cost of these books, you'd better believe I'm going to be picky about plot and characters. MHC used to be one of my favorite writers but I've noticed a disturbing trend in the lack of good writing in her recent books. Her latest effort, Nighttime is My Time, sadly confirms the point. This book is certainly not worth the sticker price, nor the 3+ hours it took to finish the thing. While the premise is an interesting one, it wasn't well developed. Too many characters, many boring, are confusing. Too many ""plot conveniences"" are in place simply to keep the story going ... blah! Stick to her earlier works."
2,It was barely okay,"I'll be the first to admit I don't care a lot for this author. I continue to go back for more occasionally, when my reading list has grown short and I need something acceptable to lay my bookish eyes upon until I happen upon a GOOD book.This was not one of her better efforts. I became confused between the characters, and bogged down by inconsequential detail. Given the nature of the book, you don't then know WHAT is inconsequential, so you must add these details to the confusion. I resisted the temptation to skip to Chapter Last, and labored through without knowing why.This will do fine if you have nothing else occupying your shelves or your mind. Even so, reruns of Seinfeld were beginning to look appealing."
3,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Mary Higgins Clark. That being said, I was disappointed with this book. The character development was poor. All the suspects seemed so similar I had a difficult decyphering who was who. I would not recommend this book if you're looking for a fulfilling thriller. Although, it does the job if you need a MHC fix."
4,Not her best but still very good,"I am a very big Mary Higgins Clark fan, owning every single one of her books. I think this book was very well written and in her usual style, but for some reason I had a much harder time getting ""into"" the book than usual. Still worth the purchase if you're a big fan like me!"
1,A Snooze,"Early Mary Higgins Clark books were very good. Recent efforts have really not been up to her early work at all. In NIGHTTIME IS MY TIME characters are rather one-dimensional and interchangeable. The suspense is sustained only through numerous red herrings. It was confusing and I just could not wait to get through the book, which was a problem, since I kept putting it down. My advice is to skip it."
5,A Good Read!,"There were some amazing characters in this book and I enjoyed the book immensely. It was hard to put down once I started reading. This is one of my favorite MHC books. I highly recommend it. Debbie Farmer, parenting author of 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'"
1,Nighttime is a Waste of Time,"Too many characters, some of which had more than one name, made this book very confusing. Not only that, it was down right boring. I found myself skpping paragraphs, something I have NEVER before done with a MHC book, just to finish the thing. Such a shame, MHC used to be an auto-buy for me, but I think in the future I'll wait for the library copy."
5,Puzzling and Captivating,"From Biblical prophets to questioning the validity of religions. From the origin of religious beliefs to fantasy. Subjects that have intrigued the human mind. Sitchin takes you on a long journey of intellect, doubt, inquisition, metaphoric interpretations and the blasphemous reality. What a wonderful book!"
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT HIS BEST,"An in-depth look at divine encounters (contacts, dreams, visions) from Sumerian, biblical and other ancient sources. This book does not have the flow of his Earth Chronicles but is interesting nevertheless. For many pages the author speculates about the Hebrew tribal deity YHWH and where it fits in amongst the Sumerian (Annunaki) gods - but the speculation is so endless that I must confess I cannot remember the conclusion he reached. Another great book in the same vein is Colin Wilson'sFrom Atlantis to the Sphinx."
3,Definitely NOT for Beginners,"Using the word ""Beginning"" in the title of this book was a mistake. However, they got me to buy it based on this word...hhmmmm. Don't get me wrong; it has a lot of good information. But once you get past chapter 3, it's no longer for beginners. I loved it up until that point. I suggest that if you REALLY are a beginner in VBA, do NOT start with this book! Try Microsoft's Access 97 Visual Basic Step by Step."
1,Not For Beginners,Chapters 1 and 2 fine. Then came Chapter 3. Gulp. Help! Now back on shelf until I get hold of a real beginners book on using Access 97 VBA. I wish I'd read more reviews before buying this book. I'm obviously not alone.
2,Leaves much to be desired,"It seemed they assumed more than the begginer knows. Their explanations on why the code works did not provide a clear enough explanation for me to understand what is going on and left gaps that I am still stuggling to fill. Also: it would have been nice to better explain how you decide what variables are required and how you decide the syntax of the commands. All in all, the books starts out ok but then leaves the beginner in the dust as it continues. I would recommend the Step by Step book over this one."
5,Very good,I didn't quite know anything about functions and subrountines in VBA until I purchase this book. It has help me out alot. I have had the book for over 3 months and am only 1/2 way through it. I like WROX books. I also have another one of there books Beginning Visual C++5. this was purchase for school. There both very good. but right now am sticking to VBA in accesss
2,nothing new here,After reading Frommers and Maui Revealed this book had nothing new to offer. A big disapointment. I left it in the hotel room.
5,Out of Many,History text book on the United States of America. This is a very in depth text book that gives a detailed account of the history of the United States of America. A very readable textbook with many pictures and interesting inserts that will keep the reader engaged throughout the entire book.
5,I'm Happy!,"I have a step ladder...too big for inside. Single-step stool....too small for many jobs. This two-step is just perfect. Not too heavy, locks into place, and I can lean forward on it and feel secure. The sticker that was mentioned in one of the reviews as troublesome came right off. All in all...I would buy it again."
3,Decent but crappy sticker gives bad first impression,"We received our stepstool yesterday and all was in order except that it took about a half hour to remove the sticker that covered the entirety of the top step. It was one of those cheap stickers that peels off only in a million pieces. After struggling with it for a while, I took a knife and slit it into strips guided by the slots in the step. Then I squirted Goo-Gone over the whole thing, let it soak for a few minutes, and peeled it off strip by strip. It was much easier with the Goo-Gone. A manufacturer that uses stickers like that should be put out of business and told why."
4,Hardcore Homecoming: November Reign review,"The Blue Meanie-Danny Doring match was sloppy & short. The Balls Mahoney-John Kronus match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Matt Hyson-CW Anderson match. Taipei Deathmatch between Axl Rotten & Ian Rotten while not as good as their first match from 1995,it was still a bloody,hardcore,hard-fought brawl. The Dog Collar match between ""Pitbull"" Gary Wolfe & Shane Douglas was pretty good for a Dog Collar match. The Jerry Lynn-Justin Credible-Steel Cage match was a hard-fought/solid bout with 2 surprise guests as a added twist. I give this event a 8 out of 10. F.Y.I This version does not have the tag team match with Team 3-D against the team of Terry Funk & Sabu which was the showstealer of the event. You have to buy the RF version of this DVD at [...] in order to see that tag team match."
4,Excellent in-depth look at first US orbital mission,"If you're a space-junkie, you will definitely want this book. Included are in-depth technical drawings, the complete ground-to-space communciations log of the mission, lots of great color photos, plus a CD-ROM with official NASA video of the Friendship 7 flight. Find out what made John Glenn such an enduring icon of this century. A wonderful glimpse into the early days of the space race."
1,Disappointment,"I received Fast Lanes Bowling and after two days still cannot get it to work. The ""read me"" instructions have lots of suggestions for what to do if it doesn't work and I've tried everything that I know how to do. I get the first screen but when I choose ""play"" all I get is ""out of range"" and no picture. I don't know what kind of video and sound card I have or how to download driver updates. I give up and chalk my loss up to just being plain ole dumb. I give it no stars."
5,Great Product,I take these every day. They are very small and so easy to swallow. I was once over-medicated for a thyroid condition and Hawthorn supplements helped getting my heart back to beating in a normal way. They are my standby for heart health.
4,Sturdy little fella,"Package came very quickly. This is a very sturdy shelf. Like other reviewers have noted, it is very tight when trying to use it for DVDs but they fit fine when you figure out how maneuver them into the shelf. DVD sets do not fit except on top shelf. Very well built, I am not sure about the price but I guess you are paying for the quality of materials (metal - connectors are plastic but strong) because there is nothing fancy about this shelf. I am satisfied!"
2,Not worth the price,"This is a very flimsy product and waaaaaay overpriced. The assembly is very intensive and what it doesn't tell you is that in order for the product not to collapse, you have to secure it to the wall using straps that look like they came off a stroller. The instructions are also a little confusing as well. I'm not going to send it back, I'll use it, only because it'll be too much of a hassle."
2,Way too short for an adult of average height,"Way overpriced for what you get. I also should have been more careful when reading the product description which lists the measurements of this product. It stands way too short at only 48 inches, but is absolutely perfect if you happen to be 4 feet tall. The advertisment really should show an average height adult standing next to it so that the consumer could see that it stands just above waist high when fully assembled. Thankfully, it arrived damaged and I was able to return it without feeling guilty."
5,CD Shelf Cures Free Fall,"The cd shelf with its some assembly works fantastically. It's very well made, no more do my cds fall and hit me in the foot."
5,"Flexible Configuration, Can Adapt to your Space","I have used these Atlantic racks for years. They are simple to assemble (tedious, but simple) and can be adapted to fit in most any space. They fit the intended software well and give me great service. I used some simple handyman skills to stack two of them vertically and then stand them shoulder to shoulder to completely fill a 8'x8' closet. I also added castors to the feet of six more units that stand in front of the closet units. It is possible to load them with too much weight at the top which makes them prone to tip, but each unit includes a strap to attach it to a wall to prevent tipping. My units are solid, strong and completely satisfying. Great for anyone who needs to fill a space by adapting modular units. Very Useful!"
3,"Buying another one, but be careful during assembly","I set mine up for DVDs and used 10 of the 12 shelves. After assembly, I noticed that the back stop on two of the shelves was wobbly and would not reliably hold DVD's. These were on the lower levels and it was too much trouble to take it apart. I'll prop them up somehow when I load those shelves.About a third of the dividers are so badly made that they will not stay in place.It's a bit wobbly and I have used the straps to hold it to the wall. So far there have been no problems with the shelf and two big dogs in a narrow hallway. I'm getting another one for CDs. I've mailed the factory so maybe I'll have some extra parts to insure I have enough good parts.---- Feb 2012: Got the second one and it had fewer bad dividers. The back stops looked good to start with but upon assembly a couple got flexible. It doesn't take much to mess them up.I never heard from the factory about the bad parts, so I took away 1 star."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"If you were hoping to have all DVDs, you can only use 6 of the shelves. I redid it so I could use all the shelves, but it's really hard to get the shelves up once they are lodged in their brackets, which I suppose is good but I ended up bruising my hands in a couple of places just trying to get those shelves off so I could space them differently.It's a nice looking shelf, though."
4,Great Shelving Unit for Cd's,"Worked out real good storing my Cd's, I even inverted the bottom shelf to put my old albums on. The picture kind of fools you,it is smaller than it looks."
4,Good product but quality may vary,"I love wire shelving for providing convenient storage that easily breaks down for moving. This multimedia shelf works well but two things must be known. The first thing is that some of the shelves may not be properly coated so there may be bare spots. The second thing is that some shelves may slightly bent, making it hard to install properly. This is true of all wire shelving and is something that has to be lived with. With this in mind, this is a great shelf that will stand up to almost anything you throw at it."
3,Okay is about right,"This shelf fit exactly where I needed it. It's easy to assemble, but not very sturdy. And the only way you can get the number of shelves in it is if you lay all the DVD's on their sides, and then it's difficult to read them."
4,Giotto Ballhead,"I am enjoying using this ballhead very much, although securing the camera release plate is a bit tricky."
5,Powerful,"I saw ""Skins"" at a movie festival for a local community college. It was so powerful and moving that I needed to purchase it. I teach a college course in Diversity and I show the film in class. All of my students who have seen the film are amazed. The American population does not know enough about the Natvie Peoples culture. This movie is great."
2,Veil Between the Material and Non-material worlds,"Excellent movie for any viewer to get a fundamental understanding of the inter-connectedness of all humans and the spirits, or the parallel worlds and other dimensions, on this level of reality ."
1,Very disappointing!,"I loved the movie ""Smoke Signals"", so thinking this would be similar, bought ""Skins."" It had filthy language all throughout and made it impossible for me to watch! Movies can be made without having to stoop so low as to curse every other word! It just shows how poorly the script writers were. If you value morals, stay away from this movie! Very disappointing!!!"
2,Pain Management Secrets,"Good effort at gathering the relevant information and presenting it in an outline/QA format, but has more than acceptable number of errors and typos."
4,Detail content of UML and a good UML reference book,I have already finished the 1st 4 chapters & I found it to be one of the best book on the subject. The English translation is good and having some math background makes it easier to understand the concept. Highly recommend for people who already know some C++ or other OO languages.
3,Fairly good UML coverage,"Since UML is a modeling language, you would expect a book on UML to explain the hows, whens and ifs regarding the UML notification and symbols. This book does the job up to point, after that you need the spec. Also, the parts covering OO methodolgy is of uneven quality. Some parts are easily understood and map to other well-known processes wheras other parts do not. If you are old to OO but new to UML you may find it useful to review the Booch - OMT - UML charts as well as the code generation samples. This is really the best part of the book."
4,Really good information in an easy to read format.,"Good and valuable information in an easy to read format. It follows a logical sequence, and keep you read for more information after every page."
4,I like it!!,"I saw this listed on a FaceBook page for Nation Train Day. I'm a train enthusiast, so a movie about a cross-country train trip sounded very cool. Needless to say I really enjoyed this movie. It was very interesting and creative and I'd recommend it. Real people don't know they are acting, but play the roles. Like I said, cool concept."
3,Poor Quality Control,"Ordered two. Got Two.- One Perfect. Other Leaked. (small pin hole at base, no dents). Better quality control needed."
2,It Leaks,"I don't know if the rubber seal was properly installed or not, but it definitely leaks. The metal on metal threads grate on each other and don't seal very well. Plus, if you're the kind of person that gets the heebie-jeebies from metal scraping on metal, don't purchase this water bottle. Also, the top is kind of hard to unscrew. If you put your finger through the hole to get more leverage, it kind of wrenches it."
3,lid problems,"i gave this water bottle 3 stars because the screw on lid leaks and holds liquid in it, whenever you take off the lid no matter how full it is, it manages to leak. its a good lookin stainless bottle, just needs a better lid"
1,Terrible Engineering,"This is the first review I have ever made, despite ordering an average of at least $500 of products a month. Generally, I'm happy with the products I order. This is the exception. I wanted a durable, easy to clean water bottle. Technically, this design satisfies both of these criteria. However, when I filled it up with water and turned it over, it leaked like a sieve. There is a gasket at the top, but it was ineffective. I rarely return products, but I did return this one."
4,Good Water Bottle,"This bottle is great to carry water with you, it's very easy to clean and very durable. However it's too big to use on a bicycle water bottle cage, but if you need water on the go and don't want to spend money buying bottled water this is the best way to carry water around."
1,Bad Quality,Bought this unit knowing it was made in China. Broke within 3 uses as the top is very cheap and Amazon would not take it back.
5,Stainless Steel Water Bottle,First off always get the stainless steel not plastic. And make sure you get the steel threaded cap not plastic threads. The large style threads like this bottle has. DO NOT get the diff. color bottles or color will peel off. Stick with the silver SS only if you want it to look new years from now. That's about it. I love these SS bottles like this. Water always taste great even if it has been in bottle for weeks. I could never say that with plastic bottles I've tried. At the time this was the best priced SS bottle in 40 oz.
4,"Very good bottle, only one issue though...","Very good bottle, only one issue though and that is the thing will leak if you don't torque it down!! I had to get this style of bottle because for some reason I always end up dropping my water bottles and with the other hard plastic style the fall head first and break. I've destroyed at least 4 in this manner and finally decided to go with a stainless steel construction. The water taste fine to me no metallic taste at all. Would I buy this product again, yeah I probably would."
5,El Alfabeto de Lola es Super!,I bought this dvd for my son who just turned 3. We are raising him speaking only Spanish at home. He loves it! He had never been exposed to Plaza Sesamo before and now he LOVES Plaza Sesamo. THis is a great way to teach the letters to your child. Highly recommended.
1,A Really Bad Start to the Comback,"Alice switched record labels from his long standing contract with Warners to MCA and threw this generic MTV metal album on a public that didn't really care all that much. Despite a vintage Alice opener in ""Teenage Frankenstein"" (which would get a much better workout when it became ""Feed My Frankenstein"") and the A ""Friday The 13th"" movie theme song, ""He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask),"" ""Constitctor"" was too formulaic and uninspired to rate more than historical notice.The best tracks from this album and ""Raise Your Fist and Yell"" are available on the ""Prince Of Darkness"" compilation. A word to the wise should suffice."
2,A flop,"The 80's was a really bad time for Alice Cooper. He hadbecome a joke of his old self. He tried to do what Aerosmithdid with P Vacation and comeback with a hair metal commericalalbum, but he flatout fails.The guitar playing isn't that bad at all, but the lyrics arecheesy making even the decent songs like Teenage Frankenstein,He's Back and Crawlin pretty much guilty pleasures. The restof the album is pure 80's mediocrity."
2,It's OK,"It's a decent album if you listen to the music but the lyrics suck! They SUCK! i can't believe Alice actually wrote any of these song except ""He's back"". That's a good song that deserves 5 stars but the rest of the album balances between 1 and 2..."
3,My Thoughts,"I thought this CD was cool because some of the songs were used on the soundtrack of ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives,"" which is one of my favorite all-time films. But I give it 3 stars because it IS cheezy 80's rock, and Alice was starting to slip past his prime."
4,lenox vase,"Broke original vase - last time had dragon fly, which seemed to be missing this time - would have prefered it."
5,Best Book Ever,"This is one of the Best Books that I have purchased in a long time. I have tried to study the Strongs meaning of Moderen Hebrew meanings when reading/studying the Scriptures, but using ""Th Ancient Hebrew Lexicon of the Bible AHLB"" I am seeing the Scriptures in a whole new light! The only problem I have is that the book is written assumeing that whom ever buys this book already have a lot of Hebrew knowledge.But it may just be me, buy the book it is a great study tool!"
5,Self discovery through writing,"Without knowing it this product has inspired me to find answers within me. By reflecting and writing stuff down you can become an open channel, little like automatic writing and really flow questions and answers that have been hidden. After months you can see how your life has unfolded and how messages are all around you to a new world. Thanks to this book, helping people, life experience I have put together soul's inner voice a profound but simple approach to changing your life in 24 hours.Thank you for your book and inspiring journey.Love and lightBradmonk"
4,Guiding Elliot by Robert Lee,"This is a fun book to read for enjoyment if you like to chuckle out loud, and can commiserate with the frustration of fly fishing, and the outright exhilaration when a good fish is caught. Most of us can identify with this book on some level."
4,"A very thorough, very technical, very advanced book!","Volker Heine's book on group theory and quantum mechanics is not for the fainthearted. To get the full benefit of the text, you'll need a college-level understanding of both mathematics and physics, possibly with a liberal sprinkling of chemistry. Nevertheless, within those bounds the presentation of the material is excellent. If you plan to work through this book on your own, take your time and enjoy (!) what he presents, probably in small pieces, and work through as many of the problems as you can to solidify your understanding before proceeding onward. No, it's not a walk in the park. Frankly, it's one of the toughest books I've ever read. But it also is one of the most rewarding because Mr. Heine can show you that with some effort you too can get a handle on this subject."
2,poor revelation,"Some beautiful views of France, England, and Malta, and a well done musical score can't save this movie which suffers from very poor storytelling. Jumping from place to place and scene to scene but not fully connecting the dots, I soon quit caring about plot or characters, replete with illogical actions and unexplained phenomenon. That's unfortunate because the core premise of finding some of Jesus' DNA is intriguing. But there's just too many inconsistencies that prevent a plausible story here. A side note; the title, Revelation, references the last book of the Christian bible, but the story only marginally draws from this source, and combines with it ideas of occultism, alchemy, and ancient & modern science to create its own take on the ""second coming of Christ"". Also, the ending is wide open for a sequel (but 9 years later, there's nothing on the horizon that I can see)."
4,This is more drama than comedy,"Gibson is very convincing as a depressed man.**Possible spoilers...though vague spoilers**The mood is like that of ""American Beauty"" (I wasn't in the mood for American Beauty which is why I gave it three stars). It's pensive, reflective; the viewer is guided by The Beaver, narrating. Not everything gets revealed in the end; you just get to step into the lives of the family members to witness them, as a whole, make a gear change."
3,The Beaver - A very good movie even though I'm not the hugest Mel Gibson fan in the world!,"This was a very good movie -- not a great movie but a very good movie. Mel Gibson is definitely NOT one of my favorite actors but I really do like Jodie Foster and think that she is not only a great actor but an awesome director as well -- she is a very smart lady and I really appreciate her work and her intelligence. Anyhow, this movie deals with severe depression and personality disorders and kept me interested from beginning to end. It deals with a man (played by Mel Gibson) who is in the midst of a major nervous breakdown/severe clinical depression/personality disorder of some sort who really does just lose his mind when he becomes obsessed by one aspect of his job. It shows off the tension in his relationship with his wife (played by Jodie Foster) as well as his children and does a fairly decent job of showing the psychology behind his issues. I would recommend this movie -- it is well done!"
1,"If your idea of entertainment is seeing Mel Gibson cut his hand off, then this movie is for you!",I want to spoil this movie. Pretty good acting that builds to where Mel saws his hand off to get rid of the Beav.
3,Lightweight but good fun,"This second in the Agatha Raisin series is a bit less interesting than the others, but still an engaging read. Agatha is both annoying but endearing, and a very unusual heroine. Beaton has a sharp view on human foibles."
3,Cheap Thrills...,"With The Foreigner, Meg Castalado has written a fast-paced, intriguing novel full of interesting characters and plot twists. The Foreigner is plainly written with little or no traces of a unique writing style on the part of Castalado. Where she shines is in the ability to construct an even, exciting page-turner. It's exciting and entertaining, plain and simple. Nothing more. But sometimes all you need is a cheap literary thrill ride like this."
4,"Brisk, Enjoyable Read","Got this book as an early fathers day present. Hadn't a clue as to the capabilities of the author. By the end of the first page, I was pleased by the likable, fast paced style of the prose. The characters developed nicely, although I must confess that I began to wonder how it would all tie together. To my pleasant surprise, it did come together and I ended up staying awake reading way past my bedtime to finish. The protagonist is very likable and I could easily see this evolving into a series."
2,Outdated and Unmoving Film,"Although the film deals with one of the best known Russian literature writers, the film itself fails on most accounts, namely because it does not deal with the tendency for times to change. With the expulsion of communist Russia, this film no longer has any prominent themes to explore and on top of that, it was done by an Italian filmed on the streets of Belgrade. It is very boring at times with unmotivated and stiff acting by most of the leads and it is a period piece. The ending was the only thing redeeming about it and I would just rate it as an average piece of work....."
3,thumbelina,"this book was really short,i probably wouldnt buy it if i were you. i read it in two days."
2,Revenge,"the poems via negativa, solitude, where-person, exhibit the tired witchery graham has been producing since errancy. the poem where the editor speaks speaks to me of her rivalry with students, she professor of oratory and rhetoric can do no more than to spit at her learners. her radar is poison. the book is boring. She seems to be paranoid about her precious banal use of the language."
3,4x6 Speaker,"So I installed these in my Jeep after replacing my rear speakers. The rear speakers made my sound much more clear and loud so I figured these would help out even more. I don't really feel that these help out that much; however, it could just be that my rear speakers are just so much louder. Also they did not fit into my Jeep's front panel speaker mounts easily. I had to cut two corners off of each speaker and then mount them in crooked just so that they would fit."
1,A disappointing CD from a great singer.,"I guess there's a reason Belinda Carlisle doesn't sing any songs from this CD live anymore except Mad About You- that's the only great song on the CD. Well, Band of Gold is pretty decent, but the rest is pure filler. It's incredible to see how much Belinda changed after this album. She left the record label that released this CD and then recorded Heaven on Earth and Runaway Horses, both superior albums with a plethora of catchy dance hits and beautiful ballads. This CD is for die-hard fans only!"
2,BETTER PACK ANOTHER...,"I am sure this CD had a lot of fans reaching for their bongs...I and I on the other hand say even though it isn't my favorite, I will try to say a few positive things: Firstly, ""Taxi Driver"" is a dope song. From there it varies from soul, R&B, and dancehall. An apogee certainly from their roots. One surprise was ""Evermore,"" and I enjoyed that joint very much. I have played it for friends that had no idea it was Steel Pulse. That was one of Phonso Martin's contributions, and I think this was the last CD he played on...dunno. This isn't their strongest release,but I always admired bands that weren't afraid to change their sound."
5,Neat shower rings!,"When I bought these, I hadn't seen these shower rings with the rollers before, but it seemed like a neat idea-and they are! They are a nice bronze color that matches all of the fixtures in my bathroom. They work great, and roll along the shower curtain rod much more smoothly than normal shower rings. They are decently large and appear to be very durable. I tried pulling on one when I took it out of the package to see if it would break if someone were to pull on the shower curtain or something, and it didn't even bend, so I don't think it will be an issue, if that ever even happens. It was also relatively easy to clip them onto my shower curtain (definitely easier than removing my old ones!). The only complaint I have about it is that the plastic package they were in seemed unnecessarily difficult to open (definitely need some scissors), but I can't count that against the rings themselves."
4,roll very well and are not huge,I like these curtain rings a lot. They roll well and are far smaller than most rolling shower curtain rings. Because of their size the focus is more on the curtain than on the rings.
3,"First went Bobby,then went Ralph","Many New Edition fans thought Ralph Tresvant would have a successful,long-lasting solo career like his fellow NE member Bobby Brown. Hey,Brown's 1986 solo debut KING OF STAGE didn't sell too well as his sophomore effort DON'T BE CRUEL,released two years later. When Tresvant put out his debut album,this one,in 1990,the other three NE members Ricky Bell,Michael Bivins and Ronnie Devoe spun themselves off as Bell Biv Devoe. Unfrotunately,this album spawned no Top 5 hits."
2,Just Terrible,"I don't know how this game is getting 5 stars. It is complicated in the way of icons and easy in the way of play. I actually sat back and let the game play itself (let time run at an accelerated speed) and I earned BILLIONS of dollars!You can open and operate a grocery store, but you have only 4 items to sell there and no marketing options, no advertising, no hiring and firing. It's just a plain bore. I think that very little thought went into its creation.I bought it because of the good reviews and the low price ($9.99). I am sorry I did."
2,"Good features, poor heat control, poor finish quality","This fondue pot has some good features, including a magnetically-connected thermostat, which, should detach should someone trip over the very short cord. As someone else also pointed out, when on warm, the heat goes full on, and boils whatever is in the pot, in order to get it up to warm - which is somewhat disconcerting. On ours, the teflon-like coating is chipping on the inside top of the pot after 4 uses (pot is cleaned and maintained per manufacturer's directions)."
1,Not Pleased,"I received this product today. The fondue pot seemed of inferior quality. The forks are VERY sharp and the instruction stated that you should ""stir the fondue with a wooden or plastic spoon to avoid scratching the nonstick surface"". However, I envisioned my friends immediately destroying the surface with the forks alone. But what will make me send back this pot immediately is that the electric plug has a magnetic attachment that seems very weak - it would not stay in the connection mechanism without falling out at the slightest turn. Oh well, I should have viewed the product in a store before buying it for a very good price on Amazon."
4,This CD has great up to date dancing music. I like Charanga music and this is just what i was looking for.,I bought one for a Christmas gift and one for myself. It had great new Charanga music that made me want to dance.
3,Determined Love,"Platinum Reviewers Rating 3.5Niobia Bryant writes a story of an artist and his assistant of who he loves from afar but reminds himself that she is off limits and will always be.Gabrielle had graduated college and wasn't sure where her career was going until she met Maxwell Bennett she fell instantly in love but took a different approach of gaining his heart. He offered her a job and a place to stay. With six years under her belt as Maxwell's, assistant she runs his life but when she finds herself falling in love with him she does everything to hold back but when the two find their selves attracted to one another a simple mistake and a busy body might drive them apart.Gabby and Maxwell are destined to be together and so they will do everything possible to make it happen even plan a wedding in ten days."
3,Buy it for the hits,"This CD has a few really standout songs, Open Your Eyes, I Never Believed, and Live for Today being a few. The rest of the tracks are b-sides and album cuts that might appeal more to a real fan of the group. I would really recommend buying a live album by these guys, as the studio polished them up way to much. This CD does have the best collection of hits for the lowest price though."
2,"A strange, poorly written story","A weird little story about a CUBE pumpkin (not square!) saving other pumpkins by ""capping a hole""[sic] in a fence that suddenly turns into an allegory praising diversity... even though the source of the diversity is completely unexplained. The cube pumpkin saves some spheroid pumpkins during a storm and then suddenly, without explanation, the pumpkin patch starts producing ""pumpkins"" of all shapes, colors, and patterns... all of which should be honored and accepted without question.I don't know how stories like this get published. The writing is painfully bad and the story is strange and disjointed.""Spookley knew what must be done. It was up to him. He was the one!"" Really? Ugh.""He stopped- right in the gap where the fence had snapped. He blocked the way. The hole was capped"".I simply cannot stand forced rhyming. Wire fences do not ""snap"". A hole in a fence is not ""capped"". This drives me nuts."
4,"shorter name, still a great band","Many will find this album to be disappointing when compared to Oingo Boingo's last album, Dead Man's Party.Upon deeper inspection they were still very much the same in sound although lyrically, they may be slightly less jokey. From my perspective, this is where Oingo Boingo grew into a less commercialized band who desired more of a limited audience. This may be due to their shortened name which some may have mistaken for an entirely different band.The songs are less memerable than their previous stuff but they kept some good material.We Close Our Eyes sounds surprising like the Moody Blues.Pain sounds like something Depeche Mode used for their song Personal Jesus with the sawing / breathing effect.Home Again is an uplifting and gradually expansive synthesized feast.The rest of the album may not appeal as much to some but it's nice to see someone other than U2 was creating great music back in 87."
5,A beautiful way of discovering Mary,"My husband gave me this book for Christmas and it has become very special to me. As someone who also grew up in the Presbyterian tradition, I had always felt the absence of Mary in the church. When, as an adult, I turned to a more ""catholic"" religion, I was finally able to embrace Mary. This book, with it's beautiful illustrations and wonderful essays is a spiritually rewarding path to Mary."
1,the joke's on you,"A masterpiece of modern literature. Have you ever read a book and been unable to put it down? Well if you have you won't need to worry about it with this one. You'll be amazed at how easy it is to put down. In fact that is one of it's biggest selling points. I was deeply saddened upon finishing it as I realized trees are dying in vain as this book is suitable only for wrapping fish, lining bird cages or training puppies. It is pure garbage and a horrible read.What does it say about yourself if you actually enjoy this book? Or even worse find it inspiring. Whew! I'd hate to find out."
5,Exelent source of information and easy to understand,"This book was exactly what I was looking for, brief but full of information on boat desing.All the formulas have examples and are easy to understand and do. The book guided me on my own desingand made it easy and fun.I still keep it in my flightbag and review it in long airport sit, can wait to finish my own designto see all the info from the book in practice."
2,worked....at first,"I loved this when it first arrived, really cute, but after a couple months of use it stopped easily opening cans and eventually it became so difficult it went in the trash, total waste of my money..."
4,It's about dang time!,"It seemed to be a long time coming and it was worth the wait. Mr. Turtledove does a fine job writing history as he imagines it to unfold. It was really disgusting to see the anti-semitism of post invasion England rear it's ugly head. There were a few astronautic mistakes, the NERVA engine on the American ""space station"" has a high thrust, but that is diminshed by the high mass of the station. All in all, it was a pretty good book, and I hope the next one is as good."
2,BOOOORING,"I enjoyed the Worldwar series. This sequel is just plain boring. Nothing happens. It is unusual that I speed read a Turtledove book (I have read most of them), but this one I did. And I am sure that I missed nothing. I will definitely read the reviews of the sequel before parting with any money for it."
4,Good read,"This is the first installment in the successor series to the WorldWar novels. The Race, a reptilian alien species, invaded the Earth at the height of World War II. The Germans, US, and USSR fought them to a draw, and the rest of the planet fell under their control. This book takes us forward 20 years to a world under mixed control. The Race's colonization fleet has arrived, setting the stage for renewed struggle.If you liked the Worldwar books and wanted to see ""the rest of the story"", this is a good start. But you'll have to wait for the sequel(s) to this book to get any real questions you had answered."
2,Not a worthy sequel,"While a moderately interesting alternate history book, DO NOT expect another ""Worldwar."" Taking place 20 years after Turtledove's original series, this book is rather boring and slow comparatively. Some interesting developments are made, especially at the end, but the majority is his constant repetition. Also, he seems more obsessed with his own character creations rather than historical figures, which noticebly detracts from the fun. Still worth reading though. (In paperback if possible.)"
2,How many more times...,"...can Harry Turtledove beat the idea to death about human technological evolution being so fast-paced as to catch sleep-ship colonists off guard? Well, it happens about every ten pages it seems, but the book overall is a decent pulp fiction read. Just be ready to expect frustrating repetition and seemingly irrelevant side stories from time to time."
1,Worst vacuum I've ever had.,"We bought this because I and my 2 children are allergic to dust, and the description talks about how it is HEPA certified and how great it is for allergens- being bagless and all. What a crock! I dread vacuming my house because I know after JUST ONE ROOM I am going to have to empty out and clean the filter, and I go through at least half a box of tissues every time I have to clean out the receptacle--(which is several times per vacuming session!) It is far dirtier and far worse on allergies to have to pull out filth and hair with your bare fingers while clouds of filthy dust fly about your head. I will NEVER buy a bagless again."
2,Inflexible Licensing Agreement,"The personal edition EULA states that it is acceptable for sharing among the immediate household. However the activation required to use the product 'locks' it to a single installation. Therefore it can only be installed one time and on a single PC. Very inconvenient if you don't have a laptop and want to use it in different areas of your home. Beware that this very expensive product is not 'yours' after purchase. It (per the EULA) will always belong to Rosetta Stone, with them 'always' dictating how you may use it."
4,Loved it,"This product had me finally understanding verb conjugation! No small feat. If you are a visual learner who gets bored memorizing vocabulary, this is for you!"
2,Qi Gong not given in detail here.,"This looks like a good book for those who want to start practising this ancient spiritual system. It is not a lot different in principle to Kundalini Pranayama.However the book is not explanatory enough. It uses terms that are not explained. If the author had been more thorough in his work and written it with the beginner in mind, explaining fully the terms and exercises then this could have been a great manual for Qi Gong practice. As it is, it has been ruined for a pennies worth of salt."
3,Hmmm...I don't know...,"Although I enjoyed this book, I have to admit I was less than thrilled by it. First of all, with a title like, ""The Dewey Dicimal System of Love"" I thought it was going to be really sexy and exciting. My hopes were dashed when I realized that there was not even a kiss in this book! I enjoyed the slight twists and turns that the character, Ally, experiences. But, the ending was disappointing. I would have liked this book to be a bit longer with a little more depth to the characters and storyline."
2,Comic?,"If I hadn't know that this was considered a comic novel, I certainly wouldn't have ascertained it by reading it. Granted, the protagonist makes the occasional witty comment, but the incidents in the book that I gather were supposed to be amusing just...weren't. The plot is pretty entertaining for about 7/8th of the book, but, as so often seems to happen, the ending was a dud. Can no one write a satisfying ending these days?"
1,Not amusing and woefully inaccurate,"This novel makes it appear that the Free Library has a staff of three people (the narrator, her assistant, and the director). Not only is that inaccurate, it's implausible. The Free Library of Philadelphia is one of the country's largest urban library systems. It has many branches and hundreds of employees. Its real director (whom I know) and staff ought to be mightily incensed by the way they are portrayed.The premise of the book is fun. In the hands (or with the pen) of someone who can construct a logical plot this could have been worth reading.A successful example of the ""stereotypical"" librarian in fiction is Miss Zukas, created by Jo Dereske."
5,A wonderful adventrue,When I was a young boy my Grandmother read the story of Nils' adventures and I still have the books. They are falling apart now so I read from the new book I received promptly from Amazon to my Grandsons. I am now 75 years old and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils and The Further Adventures of Nils Holgersson will live on in my family. Thanks
5,It is a great book!,"""The Wonderful Adventures of Nils..."" - is one of the best book written for children. I've red it when I was small, and now I am reading it to my children. I highly recommend this book. Selma Lagerlof got the Nobel Prize in Literatire in 1909. I wish Disney will make cartoon based on this book."
5,great tool!,This little note pad is a great learning tool and study guide for students as well as for all others who happen to be working in the health care profession!
1,Cannon did not work,"This transformer is certainly a great toy, but in this case the cannon was defect with a broken dart still stuck insight.The product was described as ""good"", even it was defect."
3,You can find replacement parts!,"My son got this toy and within a few weeks all the darts had fell apart! I could not find any darts that would fit it and had to write the company. They sent me soome replacement darts, but we had a hard time getting the darts to work as they were not the same size. I would not buy this toy again."
3,Not great as a toaster,"Got this because it was under $15 refurbished. Overall, it okay and has high capacity for a toaster over.However, it's not ideal as a toaster due to the fact that bread place on the rack for toasting is at different distances from the upper and lower elements. As a result, toasting is uneven on either side.Secondly, as an oven, what's annoying is that you can't set the oven to run unattended for more than 15 minutes since besides setting the temperature and setting to bake/broil, you must turn the timer/dial turn it on. Once the timer expires, the oven shuts off. And of course, you can set the timer more than 15 minutes. So if you want to bake something for more than 15 minutes, you'll have to keep adding more time to the timer."
5,Just as funky and groove heavy as the last one!,"Loose Ends still sounds just as funky on this album from 1990 as the 1988 one before it! Both Don't be A Fool and Don't You Ever Try To Change Me are both funky songs back to back! The title song is just as groove heavy. Carl McIntosh continues his funk vibe on many of the songs here. It was a big risk to continue after the two original members left, but the newer members sound just as good on this one. While I didn't hear another Loose Ends album after this one, this was another strong effort by this group!"
3,BONES,"B risk start as Irene takes off to search for bodies hid afarO ver the top psycho Nick Parrish says he knows where they are.N ick is one of the most malevolent characters I've ever seenE scapes and then proceeds to terrorise and stalk Irene.S imply put, Irene's up to her neck in trouble yet again."
3,Good Story,"I found the book to very interesting, however, I wondered where some of the research came from, especially the parts about the slick oily streets of Detroit. I have looking for that block since the book came out. I was also wondering about the info on two of the charaters in the beginning of the book. I read things that I had never heard before. I was very sadden by what happened to Sara Tokars and her family. My heart also goes out the other victims of Mr. Tokars lies and deceit. How did he get away with so much for so long. It amazes me that none of is peers recognized him as a sick, cold hearted man."
3,It could have been a contender,"While fairly well written, this book would have benefited immensely from more objectivity and less creativity. I was annoyed by all the colorful and descriptive adjectives the author kept using and would have appreciated more of the objectivity reporters such as she are supposed to have. Just a straight-forward telling of the story would have been better. Where is a good copy editor when you need one?"
3,I liked It...,"As a pilot, it was great to read about these experiences. I devoured the flying descriptions and labored through some of the rest. That's more about me than the book. A good read at a fair price. Thanks!"
3,Decent info,"This book was decent, we got the kindle version, which was somewhat tough to follow. Decent info, could have given a little more realistic experiences - only talked about the good things and did not give any cons. We liked the Fodor's way better."
5,Great quality,"It was described as ""like new"". And it's exactly like a brand new book. Very clean with no notes on it. I am very satisfied with the quality."
1,"Random Shutdowns, a handy feature in a UPS","I bought this product from another vendor 5 months ago. It will now shut down at random times throughout the day. No warning, no errors.. just shut off. The battery tests all pass and I work at the power company so Im sure we have solid utility service :) I will never purchase another Tripp Lite product, we are an APC shop for life now."
2,Shuts down,"I've had the same problem as everyone in these reviews.Have had this for a little under 2 years.I was working one day and it shut down with no warning, killing instantly my computer.According to the Self test I need to replace the battery.Changing the battery after 2 years is simply ridiculous. Even if I ignored that fact, it's simply unacceptable that the damn thing turns off just becausethe battery is faulty. I had to remove everything from the battery protected connections in order to prevent any damage on my electronic devices while I look for a new UPS.I've had no problems for the past two years but after it killed my computer because of it's shut downs thanks to the faulty battery I would never recommend this to anyone."
3,Power Supply,The power supply is very well built. It has no noise and a lot of useful outlets. The problems i have are with the software and help with software problems. The software is not exactly user friendly as you can't change the settings once they're set. Reinstall only made matters worse. Can't seem to get any help from manufacturer about the software. Would be 5 star if i could resolve software issues. Had to disable the main reason i got it; to protect the computer while i am at work. Still will be useful when i am home. Next power outage won't crash the computer as i'll be able to turn it off with UPS providing the power.Avr 750VA US120V Line-int 8OUTLET 5-15R Tel USB 750 Vaneeds an improved software to be a great product! If you need just a basic UPS then look at another product as this one is overpriced for what you end up with.
2,"Two stars for the quickstart, the only thing of value","A bloated piece of junk.If you want crossbrowser compatability, don't buy FrontPage. p. 462 ""The bottom line on DHTML effects: they only work with Microsoft's browser. TIP: The DHTML effects are controlled by an included JavaScript file called animate.js. You can also edit this file to deal with the Netscape browser.""Isn't that why I bought the *(*$&$#* book! GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN ACTUALLY USE!If you want ASP, don't look here either. Chapter 18 refers you to ""a later chapter"", chapter 21 refers you back to 18 and ""a later chapter"" that I couldn't find, I think I was just too annoyed to search.I am so disappointed with this book (and the limitations Micro$oft imposed on FrontPage) that I'll probably dump FrontPage altogether and get DreamWeaver instead."
2,Just another romance,"I had high hopes for this story. Taking place in part in Colonial Maryland, it was just the period and place I was looking for. However, there was very little to do with Colonial Maryland, but lots of stilted conversation and intimated romance with a Christian bend. The characters were typical good guy/underdog falls in love above his station, rescues fair maiden from the cruel villain and they lived hapily ever after -- after some contrived harrowing escapes from the bad guys. I think the Kindle edition might have been brought in through OCR because there were lots of words close to but not quite the right word -- like, ""she wondered onto the property."" And some just bad grammar, such as confusing I and me, etc. So, the story was the same as all other romance stories with new names, and it needed a really good editor. Still looking for a good historical author who writes about Colonial Maryland..."
4,Very good book,"Ok, this is an old book now, but I keep using it from time to time. I just wrote a obj file reader in Matlab so I can take a dxf file and display it as a patch. I also used the book years ago to write a truespace reader. I used this for displaying truespace files in Direct3D.People have complained about the Crossroads library and the examples. The truespace reader and writer examples worked fine for me, and I usually just read the description of the format and write my own code.So if you want to understand how to read or write different popular 3D formats(even today), then this is worth your money.[Tim]"
3,Great format coverage but limited by examples,"If you want a reference book for common graphic formats this is an excellent all-in-one book. Unfortunately the samples use the authors ""helper"" library code that is has copyrights and can not be used in your own software.I have had the book on my shelf for years and it has actually been cracked open a few times for reference."
4,Entertaining Game,"I bought this game for a nephew who loved this game. Worked great, came at a reasonable amount of time and in the condition as advertised."
3,Handy tool but whisk end slips,"This is a handy tool and I'm sure I'll use it often but I do have one complaint. The spiral whisk/coil part slips around so that it's sort of ""J"" shaped on the end of the stick instead of a tear drop or full spoon shape as shown. I have to push the coil back down repeatedly so it's covering the whole spoon outline and not just one side. That's annoying and a design flaw at the very least. I will probably grab for this tool instead of a table fork as I did before but I don't think it does all that much better than a standard table fork."
2,GOING NOWHERE AT THE SPEED OF SOUND ....,"THis is where this album is going: nowhere. ANVIl tried to sound modern and fast and heavy, but it's not compared with their unsung clssics of the eighties. The songs here are jus plain boring."
4,OK.,A foot longer would be better. I replaced the ones the therapist provided after several years and these are shorter.
3,Copa Sesamo good for school age children,"This is a good DVD that teaches kids teamwork, how to be healthy and a sense of self pride by helping their own community. Very appropiate lessons for early school age children to learn. This DVD is all in Spanish and features Mexican footballer Jorge Campos."
5,Organization,"Great way to organize tool and tool box. Very great product, very stronge high strength plastic. Product is light weight and nt to bulky."
1,This watch is not all stainless steel,"I bought this watch for my girlfriend last christmas, and the watch is already showing a goldish color coming through the supposive all stainles steel watch.my girlfriend has had the watch for about 8 months.if I would have known it was not all stainless steel I would not have bought this watch."
4,Different but good...,"This album is somewhat different from the rest of the music produced by David Grisman at the time or even since then. The genre is certainly not bluegrass but more like swing. A few of the track titles actually represent their music types pretty well (example: Dawgalypso is a calypso). The album does live up to its title and is acoustic music.Of all albums produced by David Grisman, Acousticity reminds me most of Svingin' with Svend but the latter is a little more jazzy and I enjoy Acousticity a bit more.It is nice to have an alternate take on some of Dawg's better known tracks such as Newmonia and Richochet.I rate it lower than a 5 because it is not a hit album like albums The David Grisman Quintet, Mondo Mando, or Quintet '80 but if you have these others you may enjoy adding Acousticity to your collection."
4,I am glad to see this movie on dvd!,I am glad to see this movie finally put out on dvd! The only thing I do not like about this movie being put out on dvd is that the dvd is a DVD-R I think for the price that we are paying for this it shouldn't be in the DVD-R format.Other then that I think this is a very good movie that I think most of the Three Stooges fans would enjoy watching
3,"It's OK, not great.","I looked at one other book before purchasing this one, Refactoring to Patterns, but I picked this one because this one had 5/5 average review. I should have picked the other one, though. :-(This book starts out great, the first 2 chapters (out of 4) give you quite a few tips and rules of thumb. However, once you get to chapter 3 and 4, the chapters on patterns, the author does a so-so job. Quite frankly, I had hard time reading those chapters. I thought that by looking at code you might learn more about patterns. Not true. Especially, when you have to look at GUI code, as is the case with this book. I did not like that.Maybe that's only me, but I would recommend the Kirovski's book instead (at least look into it)."
5,If He Hollers,Super great author. Kept me thinking about who really was the bad guy. Had a hard time putting down this book.The character's were so believable. It was like I really knew them. Mel and Phil the greatest. Lenny was also great.
4,The It Factor!,"This guy really has an incredible voice, full of soul, power, emotion, feeling, and control! We need more products from him!!"
2,Kelly,"Very disappointing. This ball is very cute but does not last longer than a couple of months. Shortly after we bought it, the ball had deteriorated to a point where it no longer held air. It had small cracks throughout the rubber and I was concerned about the overall quality."
4,My experience with the Epson Stylus1270 Ink Jet Printer,I absolutely love the great pictures this printer will print.Since I owned it I have printed all my photos for contests and exhibits with it and have received recognition and awards. Sure saves a lot of money at the photo lab!The reason I cannot give this printer a 5 is that the plastic clamps which are used to install the color cartriges are very flimsy. The clamp holding down the color cartride has now broken off and I have to use tape to hold the cartridge down and in place. A crude method for such a sophisticated maschine.
4,Excellent,Order was shipped very promptly. Sale price was a steal. Easy to use and performance is great. Very satified with product and purchase.
5,"If you like the album, you should see them live.","First saw them at The Venue, East Belfast, on the off-chance and have been hook ever since. Was fortunate to see them again a few months later, headlining with Slipknot and the Docklands Arena, London.Warning: Fish-out-of-water. Do not listen to it at work! Singing along to it may make other's offended. ""...loser!""Wrote this review when looking for a latest album. Does not appear to be one, so off to Google I go...."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I bought this book becase of the title, assuming there would beactual ""tactics"" to use in helping my Mother's battle with cancer. That's not what it's about. It's more like amazing stories, and having a ""go-get'em!"" attitude. If you're in the mood for inspiration and pep talks this may be enjoyable reading. In my search for non-fictional sources of information on fighting cancer, this book was not helpful at all. Not to be completely negative it's not a bad book to read, it's just notwhat I got the impression it was going to be about."
3,"A good album, but not enough to match Don't Be Cruel...","Unfortunately, the interest in Bobby Brown seemed to dip at this point (1992). As a result, his third album didn't fare as well. Although there are a few standout tracks (Get Away, Something In Common, Good Enough), Bobby fails to convince us all that it's still his prerogative. This fact clearly overshadows Teddy Riley's production contributions (Teddy produced half of the album's tracks). If you're a Bobby fan, then you might like this one...I only like a few songs...but I dig Teddy's productions."
2,Spread Too Thin,"Only about 100 this book's 460 pages discuss options in any level of detail. The rest digresses among a wide variety of topics, including basic finance and several plugs for the author's web site: [...]. The discussion on options strategy was adequate but not inspiring. I found a few errors in the risk calculations and the risk charts were hard to read and not fully explained."
1,Three Suckskateers,Don't waste your money. This movie really sucks. Sucks really isn't a harsh enough word to describe how bad this movie really is - it's sucky-suck. I would watch this again if someone paid me - a lot.
1,SAD,"This is possibly the worst version of this epic tale I have ever experienced, flying ships, REALLY. Not to mention poor acting, this movie trashed the idea of the Musketeers."
3,It's OK,"This movie is nothing to spend your money on. It finally came to me through Netflix and I was looking forward to something fresh and new from the Three Musketeers, but I guess there is no such thing.It is the exact same story that's been done 100 times already but they added in DaVinci's flying machine or some such thing...I couldn't even get into it enough to pay attention to the details because it was so utterly disappointing right from the beginning! My kids distracted me from the flick and I was happy to let them because I was so bored....If someone had never seen a movie about the Three Musketeers then I suppose it could be a fun flick, but for anyone who has seen other Musketeer movies this one was just a waste of time."
3,Glad I didn't see it in the theatre,"Sure, the fights would have been fantastic on the big screen, but thank God that I didn't spend that money on the lacking of plot.It was a pity. Plus, I really hope they don't make the sequel."
4,Saturday popcorn movie,"I bought this because the color and cinematography were so good when I saw it at the theater. It's a silly story with most of the performances phoned in, but good for a crummy winter afternoon where the weather sucks."
1,Why Keep On Making These Type Of Movies,"I've come to terms that Hollywood just doesn't get it and that they are out of ideas and keep on pestering the past greats with today's ""advanced technology"" and just make up for lousy none plotting direct in your face snore fest of movies without potential or without value.Here come another Three Musketeers movie.Like every 5 to 10 years Hollywood releases one with distinct backgrounds and nothing more to show than one has seen before.Always young actors playing the titular role which always fails (Remember the 2000's The Musketeer????).Adding Milla Jovonich does what exactly?? show off that in past times women knew karate and blow stuff up.Wow, really real stories.Three Musketeers with slapstick humor, yawning plot and decent to bad acting just digs a hole.No more Musketeer movies.Alas, Hollywood never learns and one day might make a Musketeer movie in space!"
1,WTF,"The only thing this rendition of the film had in common with the Three Musketeers, of any kind, were the names of the characters. Except for Milady, which isn't even a name."
3,Huge but Shedding Teddy Bear,"The bear is indeed pretty huge. Soft and cushy. However, pulling on its fur leaves you with a handful, so after a few weeks of use, the bear will have some 'bald' spots."
2,NOT THE BEAR SHOWN! BEWARE!,The bear I received doesn't look like the photo shown. It is really a very very dark brown. Feet and hands also do not have the cut outs as shown. Not worth the money! Find a nicer one at Walgreens for half the price!
3,Cute and Cuddley but Overpriced,"Yes it is a cute, large, well-made bear but overpriced. I bought this bear for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She has not really played with it that much, so I somewhat regret the purchase."
3,Bigger than my Kid,"So soft and fluffy and great for photo ops but terribly huge. Very cute though, personally a little pricey but if you wait there are good sales on Melissa and Doug products where you can almost pay half the price."
5,WOW!,This bear is pretty awesome. It is really large and the gf loves it! It seems sturdily constructed and like it will hold together for a good while. Was shipped and received quickly.
3,Interesting but redundant,"HE basically takes an entire book to explain that fractals exist everywhere including finaincial markets and that we don't account for real market volatilites and catastrophic events. And explains it over, and over and over to make an entire book of it. And offers no solutions or actualy market applications. Good only for if you need a reference of how fractals are in relative in finance"
1,don't waste your money and time,"the author claims that the book will not make you rich but would make you understand the market behaviour better and thus avoid loss, he's right on the first part and wrong on the second part, he may be a genious but if he does not improve his presentation 100 times, this book will achieve one thing only - waste your time and money"
4,Numerically Fascinating - Financially Baffling,"As a Series-7 licensed investment advisor, I felt pretty confident that I'd be able to follow what this book was about - as I work with the numbers of the market every day.Wrong.Totally went over my head. Financiers beware. Unless you're a mathematician on the side, this book might do you little more than add sex-appeal to your nerdy bookshelf."
5,A Financial Classic,"If you've often wondered why most things economists or the popular press say about financial markets don't make sense, this book explains why, and in suprisingly well written terms. If only they taught math like this at school I might have taken some notice of it."
1,Beware Sabatier,"Beware of the name Sabatier. This famous French manufacturer's name has been robbed. Products sold with this name may not actually be Sabatier knives. Genuine French Sabatier knives will have a diamond, like a cut stone, ahead of the name, there will not be a registered trademark symbol after the name. The knives that do have a Sabatier name without the diamond are fakes."
5,One of the best old school R&B cds I own,Great music. Smooth. I like this a LOT more than Barry White. The music is more insightful and I prefer his voice.
3,Tasteless Architecture!?,"There is lots of good stuff on building underground in this book, but whoever designed some of the homes shown inside has no taste when it comes to architecture, so unfortunately I can see a few people being turned off by some the photos, and deciding not to build underground. There are more in depth books on building underground, so don't just use this one book to build your underground home with."
5,Great Find and Helpful!,"First I'd like to say this is a very informational book for those on a low budget but like art deco style furniture. As a former college student, I know how hard it is to manage day to day life on a budget, and still have nice things in your home. Well if you follow this book, you will get some nice things (especially like the wine rack)!As for those who wrote a bad review because the author had an ""attitude,"" I don't think there is any pettiness involved in reviewing your own book. It's a great accomplishment! Before you go about giving someone's book that you haven't even read bad reviews(which isn't even fair!), write your own, come back and let us tear apart all your [years] of hard work.Good job author! 5 stars!"
3,ELMO is possessed!,"This Elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night. I had to ship the first one back to FP on my own dime to get a new one, that one was broken as well! The cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the ABC part does not work. this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on! what a pain! shoddy electrical work. i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat. make sure you get this garbage on sale!"
3,Elmo's Sing & Teach Table is better for ages 2yrs+,"My 1-year-old loves this toy, but isn't really at the age where he'll press a button and listen to the whole song. This is a great toy for children who are already starting to talk. What I don't like about his toy is that when the different characters sing or talk, Elmo's head rocks side to side regardless. Also, the phone that comes with it doesn't do anything (no noises or pressable buttons)."
1,Watch your baby carefully witht his toy!,"My baby recieved this toy when he was 9 mos. old. He loved it immediately, but please beware! The legs of this table are extremly flimsy and if your baby stands and leans on this toy, he'll go toppling over!!! The first time my baby played with this toy he fell down. There is absolutely no support for the standing child with this toy. I finally had to take the legs off and let my baby just play with the top of it. I really do think that this toy is hazardous to chilren."
2,"Great, IF it would work!!!!","My son loves this & it is a wonderful toy for teaching children shapes, colors, etc. BUT, we are now on our third one (the 1st was given to him at Christmas) many of the parts just stopped working before he had it a month. The ones that did work said the wrong thing. The 2nd I didnt try at the store, when we got home cookie monster didnt work. The 3rd I looked over at the store last week before leaving with it. I thought it was fine,, my husband just told me he hated to do this but he pushed the nose & guess what,,,, it is singing the eyes song. The last time I took it back I had to ask if many others had problems & the reply was no. Now that I have checked online I think Fisher Price should do something about this."
2,Toy is o.k.,This toy seems geared toward tots between the age of 12 months to 18 months but isn't really tall enough for them to stand and play with. It seems like every time my twin girls go near this toy they want to climb on it more than play with it how it was intended to be played with.
3,1Yr old loves it But we are on the 3rd Table!,"My 1yr old daughter Loves this toy and plays with it a lot, but we are on our 3rd table! The first one, the phone stopped working, then shortly after that cookie monster stopped working also! We went to exchange it and same thing wit the 2nd table, cookie monster would not work! We are on the 3rd table and every couple of days the music stops playing! We have to turn it off then back on again to get the music to work! She has also fell over a couple of times because of the 3 legs being unbalanced so we had to set it between the couch and the chair to make it stable. Great fun for my daughter but lousy design and durability."
4,Great even at One!,"I bought this for my son,who just turned one. He loves it! It's a great learning toy for the money! Very worth it! My son was a little behind in development & this was a great toy to help him!The only thing I thought could be improved is,it would be nice if the keys would change songs if pushed a second time! They only repeat the same thing when pushed twice. Overall-it's still a wonderful toy!"
3,Not very durable,"My 1 year old daughter played with this toy for 15 minutes and the Cookie Monster mechanism on it broke. Cookie will not say ""open"" or ""close"" or antything else unless you force the toy down on the triggering button. Otherwise she loves the toy and I find it to be very stable for a child who has his/her balance. It does keep her quite busy when she's at work with me."
4,"Release this on CD, or I'll give you elephant balls!","This is one of the most entertaining, distinctive soundtracks from the eighties. Highlights for me was Oingo Boingo's title track, ""Circle"" by Max Carl, ""Deep In the Jungle"" by Wall of Voodoo, ""(Why Don't Pretty Girls) Look At Me"" by the Wild Men of the Wonga, ""Method to My Madness"" by Lords of the New Church and ""Eighties"" by Killing Joke.Certainly a better ratio of good to bad songs than other John Hughes films, catchy and danceable. If you find it on tape, give it a listen. And if you are one of the powers that be at MCA, re-release this on CD! It will sell at least as good as ""Repo Man""."
5,Great,I just finished reading this book yesterday and I'm devastated I didn't get the sequel at the same time as the first book. I'm soo pleased I stumbled upon this book. Its soo gripping and vivid I just couldn't put it down. Highly recommend it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Too complicated,"Overall this book is not that bad, but too complicated when you read on, too many characters and not what I have expected from a vampire fiction. I haven't finished reading it yet, so I cannot comment too much. But unfortunately I get bored and I don't have the thirst to read on. It doesn't appeal to me in a way that I have hoped it would like other vampire fictions. Even though I still believe different readers have different tastes, so you might like it who knows."
1,Tired and slow,"I'm a big fan of vampire fiction in ganeral, and Saint-Germain in particular. However, I returned this book to the library after 2 weeks with only 30 pages read. Yarbro's latest few SG novels have had a tendency to become ever-more long, boring, and laboriously slow. None of the sense of action and excitement present in Blood Games or Tempting Fate."
4,It's a Boba Fett cutout--it doesn't do anything except look cool,My husband loves Boba Fett. We originally found this cutout on the street and it was like he found a hundred dollar bill. Then it was stolen during a move!As a surprise I bought him a new one. It's sturdy and it's life sized. It's large. It's made of thick cardboard. It doesn't do anything except look cool in my husband's office.
1,Poor QC and Workmanship,"I ordered this trap to help catch some wild rabbits that were taking over my yard. When I received the trap I opened the box and noticed a few parts that were bent and out of place. I started re-shaping and trying to put them back in place so the trap would function properly, that's when I noticed some of the rivets were not even holding two pieces of metal together. Looks like during the assembly the worker drilled the holes to large for the rivet to catch, so they just stuck them in the hole and secured one side only. The rivets serve no purpose what so ever, POOR WORKMANSHIP AND NO QC. I sent it back and made my own."
3,Seems OK,I have only had it a short time. I would like to hold off on the review after I catch a rabbit.
2,Not the Havahart traps of yesterday,This trap is not like the older Havahart traps in construction and just doesn't work very good. I have the older version of this trap and that is the reason I ordered this one. The old one has a different mechanism and works much better. I wasted my money on this one.
1,Rube Goldberg,The trap has insufficient sensitivity to catch small rabbits. It's a wonderful feeder though.
1,poor product,I had owned a havahart trap for at least 30 years and it worked very well until someone stole it from my yard. I ordered a new one and received it okay but after setting it up came to realize that it was extremely sensitive and was also poorly manufactured in a sense it would rock when place on a flat solid surface. The openings on the ends of the trap are not a reflection of one another. Use to this trap is a problem and I'm sorry that I did not receive one that works.
5,Moolighting soundtrack is the best,"This is an absolutely fantastic CD. After buying the Moonlighting DVDs, I had to have the soundtrack. You get to enjoy songs by great singers like Billie Holiday and The Isley Brothers. You also get to listen to Bruce Willis' version of ""Good Lovin'"" and Cybill Shepherd's versions of ""Bluemoon"" and ""I Told Ya I Love Ya, Now Get Out"". If you're a fan of the show, you'll be a fan of this CD."
5,The best hair dryer,"My sister-in-law, who is a former hair stylist had bought me this brand of hair dryer five years ago. She had stayed at my house and used the one that I had which was purchased from a local retail store. She thought it was the worst product she had ever used. She then sent me as a gift the ""Hot Tools"" brand. I loved that hair dryer as did both of my daughters. Just recently it had blown it's last hair style, so I went online to find it again. They no longer make the kind that I had but I purchased another ""Hot Tools"" dryer and I absolutely love it. This product is durable, but most importantly the speed in which it blows your hair dry is incredible. I highly recommend this product for people with any type of hair. My money was well spent."
4,Great Dryer - but not for Volumizing,"I got this for Christmas and I absolutely love the rubberized coating which makes it easy to grip. It's very easy to handle because it's lightweight. My hair is shoulder length and cut in layers. I use root boost and Aveda texturizing gel to get volume on the top of my hair. With my old conventional dryer, I could get great volume and really didn't even have to use hairspray. With this dryer, my hair is limp. It's a great dryer if you don't want volume, but I need a dryer that won't prevent me from having a great hairstyle. I don't know if the problem is the tourmaline, the pro-moisture control feature, or ionic feature since I can't find one person who really knows the difference."
4,Good book with solid advice,"While I enjoyed reading much of this book, and it had excellent advice, I found much of it only applying to project managers and other management with the ability to really effect change. As a lower level developer, there's not a lot I can do with the information in this book, but I think it's relevance will increase ten fold as I progress through my career, hopefully saving myself from making many mistakes on the way.Overall it was a nice easy read, but beware that it won't be very applicable early in your career."
1,NEVER RECIEVED ORDER,I ordered this costume on 22Sep and it is now 13Nov and I am still waiting for it to arrive. I have contacted the seller for a refund and received NO response.
4,pretty good deal,"I thought it would hold more, but that's more my fault. should have done better with measurements. it's a little flimsy but for the price I got what I paid for. took a little longer to get to me then I would have liked, but when I made inquires they where very quick to respond. all in all pretty good experience ."
4,"Polemic, but valuable","It is not an attempt at a history of times, nor a biography of individuals, but an attempt to prove a point. It does pretty well at that, but know what you are getting into.Please note that all the critical reviews seem to miss that concept of arguing a point."
5,need an antidepressant?,"I'm normally a poetry hater, but this anthology just makes me happy. From little one-liners to long stories these are the best selections to uplift your spirits. Not just pure sap either, there is plenty of bittersweet happiness too as in pieces on sacrifice, honour, & love lost. It took me ten years to find a book store that had this collection of ""beautiful things"" after encountering it at my school library, and it was very much worth the search.It is the kind of treasure book you can open at random points & find something new to enjoy everytime. It's a book to relish for a lifetime."
5,Adorable,"Little Minerva Louise is just adorable and my son loves this book. I love the illustrations of Minerva. Her face is so darn cute - she is just always happy and positive. My kids are only 3, and we look at the pictures and we like to point out Minerva's funny observations. They crack up when they see her having her tea party with the tools and flower pots. At their age, they don't find it as funny as I think they will in the future to correct Minerva's mistakes, but they just like her. I am adding this to my library, and I am sure they will read it and love it for years."
2,Does Not Fit 2005 Subaru,"This sensor appears to be good quality, but it DOES NOT fit my 2005 Subaru Legacy (non-turbo, 2.5L 253J engine). Although the Bosch site shows it as the proper sensor pre-catalyst, it is not. The NTK/NGK 24696 fits perfectly. The connector and overall length are different, so they are definitely not the same. The NTK site matches a different Bosch sensor to the 24696."
5,A very big help,I have limited use of my hands & arms & find typing very difficult when doing large tasks. Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 has been very easy to use & was ready to go as soon as I loaded the software.
3,WRONG,"I don't know whose mistake it is, but the title track isn't by ""The Night Riders"", it's by NIGHT RANGER."
4,Realistic and Entertaining,"Thelma Balfour is a perfect example of what can happen when one turns a hobby into a career. Writing on this subject matter to a particular segment is long overdue. Throughout the book, the writing is very detailed and exact about each of the signs. Everyone should read this book before getting involved in any relationship."
1,BOY DID I MAKE A MISTAKE,"When I received the DVD, I immediately knew that I had made a mistake with this order. Poorly packaged, and appears to have been ""copied"" in someone's basement. For what you receive, this is over-priced and under-delivered. I will not make the same mistake twice. I would rate this product a BIG THUMBS DOWN!"
2,Vickie Winans #1 Fan,"I'm Vickie Winans #1 fan. I have majority of her music collection. However, I did not care too much for ""The Lady"". The only song that I enjoy is ""Just When"" (duet with former husband Marvin Winans). I still enjoy Vickie Winans. If you're looking for hand-clapping, tear-jerking, down-to-earth music from Vickie Winans: buy Live In Detroit 1 & 2. You will truly enjoy Vickie at her best."
2,extremely light weight,"Price seemed to be a bargain, but I noticed the lid was suprisingly light weight upon receipt. Returned item after first use. Lid would not remain in place while braising vegetables (kale and swiss chard). Lid may not be constructed from stainless steel as indicated. Purchased a better quality version from Bed Bath & Beyond with 20% off."
4,Is it possible to establish a love affair with a kid?,This beloved film with Greece as the supreme landscape presents one of my ever lasting beloved actresses : Liv Ullman with the charm of Gene Kelly making all he can for this relationship materializes.Ullman showed to have a huge talent for the comedy after a brief interval in a set of brilliant Bergmanian films.An unforgettable little gem of Irving Kershner.
3,Ray is a great musician but.....,"Ray is a great musician, but the singing is .....ugh. Somehow, I guess it worked in the 80's, but now its like you can hear him laughing at his audience."
4,"A ""must have"" for railroad historians!","This book (hardcover), has to weigh a couple of pounds and is ALL maps. It shows the physical plant of Northeast railroading just after World War II. If you are fortunate enough to have a collection of individual railroad-issued maps you will know the routes that these railroads ran, but this book will show you just WHAT was along the routes. Items such as stations, interlocking plants, junctions etc are listed. As a practical aside, if you are reading an issue of a railroad magazine that highlights an area like Maybrook yard in New York, the maps in this book can help you follow the story accurately!. The ONLY thing this book has that keeps it from being a 5-star is that all of the maps are drawn in ink instead of some other reproduction process. For a map affectionado(sic)? like myself this is not a problem, but if someone is wanting a coffee-table picture book with maps, then this book is not for you. For everyone else, HIGHLY recommended!"
3,"Good size overall, not for ""heavy"" use though....","Purchased two of these to save space on the home machines, which it accomplishes exceptionally well. Worked from home one day though and the ENTER key is a little tough to keep track of as a touch typist. Also, I'm used to a little greater angle and this keyboard only sits flat. Overall, okay, but again, not for heavy usage."
2,"Good size, but that is about it","The size of the keyboard is exactly what I am looking for but the design is somewhat boring, or actually cheap. A bit more style would be nice. The layout of the keys is good for me. Not sure if this keyboard is spill-proof. There are no holes in the bottom.It looks quite robust. I'd take it anywhere and not fearing scratches on it. It would be a different story if it was more stylish.The buttons were a bit stiff to press in the first week. They became more flexible after that but it still requires much effort to type compared to the more high profile keyboards out there. It also isn't a very quiet keyboard. I'm now on the lookout for a more quiet keyboard."
2,Enter key is in the wrong place!!,"This keyboard seems like a quality product, but it has a fatal flaw: the Enter key is not in the right place! The \ key is where the Enter should be! It does NOT look like this in the picture here on Amazon. I've used many different keyboards: standard size, keyboard size, even typewriters, and there are always small differences in the less-used keys that you have to get used to. But since it is used so often the Enter key is different -- I don't think I'll be able to get used to it and I will have to send it back. It's a shame too, because other than that it seems to be nicely put together."
1,Forget it!,"I amreally disappointedwith this keyboard.AndsinceI liveonasmall islandinFiji andit took 3 weeks to get it here, I amstuck with it . You can seefrom what I have just typed why I am not very happy with it. The spacebaris completely dysfunctional.It isnoisyand I HATEIT.Ronald Weiss"
1,"Cheap, in more ways than one...","I was so happy to get this small keyboard and was ready to order another until I tried to use it. Within 10 minutes I was frustrated undoing unintentional typos, put it back in the box, and intend to get a refund."
4,Quite satisfied so far.,"After just under one month it has delivered everything it promised. For me though it needs to stand the test of time.That being said, it is certainly the best buy for the money. Other reviews complained about the noise of it warming up. I haven't found it to be much of an issue. The print quality is good and the speed is good also."
2,Strays from Conan Doyle,"The story here had some promise, but Millett ruined it by injecting again (as in his ""Ice Palace"") the character of Mary Comstock. His late 1990s mind-set and desire to attract women readers allowed him to stray away from the spirit of the Canon by having her foil Holmes' attempts to bring her to justice. Perhaps we should be lucky Millett did not have Holmes fall in love with and marry her."
3,The problem is what's NOT on this CD.,"BEWARE: The climactic song, Charlie Sexton's ""Beat So Lonely"" is NOT on this CD."
5,Best. Soundtrack. Ever.,"That's really all you need to know; beginning to end, song for song, this tight set is the best soundtrack ever."
4,Opening Track,"A delightful film, matched by tracks that were obviously picked with scenes in mind. I have to agree with fellow reviewer Emily that the opening track is the cat's whiskers, but unfortunately, it doesn't appear on the album. The track is called Dr Mabuse by a German band called Propaganda, and the opening titles with Mary Stuart Masterson on drums listening to the track on headphones is excellent."
2,Ponderous,"Ratio of academic sludge to remotely useful information, even for high level advanced driver training or driver instructor training is woeful. Very disappointing. Seems obvious that this was written to satisfy some publish or perish requirement. A PHD in psychology is a must in order to have a chance of being able to get much out of this small tomb."
2,Predictable,"If Aeon wasn't enough to let you know who was the creative force behind Emperor here's the absolute proof that Ihsaan was the man and Samoth, well..., wasn't. This cd is, to put it simply, boring. Yeah it's full of head crushing riffs and manic drumming courtesy of Trym but so what? Zyklon cover no new ground. They aren't doing anything they haven't done before except rely too often on death metal cliches we've heard regurgitated time and time again by a million other bands. By the third song it's very apparent that Zyklon have nothing left to say. They sound played out. Now a band doesn't have to be musically original to be good if they have that emotional kick, that shot to the back-brain, but Disintegrate just leaves me cold in a heard-it-all-before kind of way. I've been to that ""room"" many times before and you know what? It's gotten old. Get World Ov Worms instead and forget the rest."
4,It is very fun to play with!,The instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out. You had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down. Then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target. Otherwise I it is holding up great so far!
1,Parts Missing,We just bought this item and after getting most of it set up we realized that one of the most important bars was missing from the box. After reading the other reviews I think we will just get our money back and look for another option.
1,Mavis Should Be Ashamed!,What a joke! This product is more about NetZero than typing. I bought this program so my daughter could practice typing and 10-key but all we got was NetZero and it does not ask your permission to put NetZero on your computer. Such a sad day for Mavis Beacon. My suggestion is try a free online tutor first. If you buy this product all I can say is good luck.
4,Good but not Perfect,"I thought that in my thirties, after years of using 4-fingers to type, I would never really be able to learn the proper form for touch typing. This is a terrific program; I went from 7 words per minute to 40 words in 1 week. The problem with the program is that once you get to the ""advanced"" level it has a limited number of passages which it keeps repeating. Also the program does not include a series of tips for common weaknesses (using the pinkie, for example). It is very good at getting beginner's to become medicore typists but not so good at getting a mediocre typist to the next level. In my case become mediocre was a big leap, esp in just 7 days, so I give it 4 stars."
2,Good Book but Small Type,"I know from reading a hard back of this book several years ago that it is an intriguing and moving account of the disasterous battle of the Somme which took place in the summer of 1916.However the pocket format paperback I purchased through Amazon is printed in small type, less than 10 point, which I no longer can read. So if you are over 50, you might consider a different edition."
1,I was not impressed ....,I was anticipating a terrific read after I looked over exerpts of the book on the America's Cup Web site ... but frankly I was bored. I did read the whole book but compared to Fastnet Force 10 this book is very weak in story and technical descriptions.a.e.
3,Good resource for traveling!,I like the simplicity of the book. It is arranged in sections according to use and then also arranged alphabetically within the glossary. The only down fall for the book is that it does not have a glossary alphabetized in Japanese with the English word or phrase following it.
1,Statistics for Managers Using Microsoft Excel and Student CD Package (,This book is not written with the student in mind. Your best bet - go to the library and pick up additional basic statistics books to aid in your understanding of the concepts and formulas.
4,packaging,"i am delighted that timeless is releasing season two, i have watched season one, all 39 episodes too many times to count.....however looking at the photo above, this item has the appearance of having the same horrible packaging as season one....it is difficult to comprehend why the producers of this product would do this again.....i do hope my observation regarding this is wrong, wrong, wrong.....my season one arrived with scratches and scuff marks on the disks, so i ordered a second set and lucky for me i had not gotten to UPS quick enough to return the first set, as the second set was even worse than the first....i kept the first and i bear with the skips.it is pitiful to pay so much money and have new disk arrive in that condition, i have purchased many a used dvd and cd and they arrived in flawless condition for a fraction of the original price...."
4,This is truely Something Real,"Seeing as though it is a known fact that Stephanie can sing, I think I will just refrain from repeating that. This cd was Stephanies follow up to the platinum cd ""Home"". I love the selection of songs such as ""All day, all night"", Somewhere in this broken heart"", ""Heartache"", and ""Policy of love"". These just happen to be my favorites. There is a womans athem, ""24hr Woman"" which is something I thought Toni Braxton should have been singing,HAHA but Stehanie delivered just as well. It is a shame that things didn't work out between Stephanie and MCA, because i think she was headed for higher things. But that didn't stop the flow of quality work from this seasoned artist. The cd has a nice mixture of tunes that you will surely love."
2,AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING VOICE IN NEED OF BETTER SONGS TO ROCK AN AUDIENCE WITH!,"I love,love,love,love,love,love, love me some Stephanie Mills!She is phenomenally talented with a sultry and powerful angelic singing voice! I ain't hating on Stephanie Mills at all! The ""SOMETHING REAL"" album is an interesting listen! Stephanie's amazing voice still gives me goosebumps whenever she sings!However, this album doesn't come close to her other efforts, like her self-titled 1985 album. There are no haunting ballads and danceable tracks the likes of STAND BACK, or UNDER PRESSURE, or JUST YOU, or THE POWER OF LOVE on this Stephanie Mills outing. But what is here is still enjoyable.But I'm still glad that I bought this cd. In an era of awful pop music and R&B; thugs, it's still cool to hear real talent in any form!"
3,Bloody fun,"Entertaining enough, and very bloody, in the vein of Kill Bill. Lots of hacked heads and limbs. The story is good enough for this sort of outing, and the hero is sympathetic enough. Some great fight choreography."
2,There are better options in this genre,"I'm being pretty generous with the 2 star rating. To begin with the featured lead, Rain, has no chemistry what-so-ever with his co-star Naomi Harris. That would have been helpful because none of the acting is. Yes, of course there is some well choreographed stunt work but it isn't enough. I think this movie was supposed to have some sort of graphic novel feel, but it played more like a video game given the massive amounts of blood squirting everywhere. This just isn't very good. There are better options out there for this genre.The Blu ray transfer and the DTS HD Master Audio is very good."
3,Action Movie.,"Kind of the same old story told in a different way. I like the action very much. I felt like the movie was over just as fast as it begun. I have watched it a few times already and it is something I would see again. Overall, the movie was good. I was able to get a great price for it so I'm not mad that I bought it. I watched it a few times like a said, but I would have been renting it for a few days and be done."
3,Saved By The Gore!,"Ninja Assassin is a strange one. It starts out with a bloody bang that is awesome, but there is no more awesomeness for another forty minutes or so. I was really struggling to stay awake while watching the boring plot unravel with boring characters. The gore is pretty much the only thing about Ninja Assassin that I liked. Everything else is deadly dull. Where's Bruce Lee when you need him?"
4,Book Is Good Enough For Basic Administration,"If you want an introductory Bordermanager administration book, then this book will fulfill your needs. Laura does a good job of introducing Bordermanager in the first few chapters. The rest of the book is on Proxy & VPN setup\configuration, and troubleshooting. If you're new to Bordermanager then I would recommend that you download all the Bordermanager Pdfs from Novell's documentation site. Since it is an admin book, containing much material pertaining to administrators, don't expect much on the Bordermanager basics. Again, go to Novell's documentation site for that. I would also add that some chapters will aid you in the Bordermanager exam, specifically the chapters on Proxy & VPN."
2,Disappointment,"These pearl studs are okay, but unlike the picture. The truth is that the size advertised is correct, but the studs are button style, meaning they are flattened in the back. No where is this mentioned in the description before buying; however, it says so on the back of the box, specifically :11-12mm freshwater pearl earrings, button style""! Also, although Amazon gives you one shipping date, Ross-Simons gives another and Ross-Simons is the correct date. Altogether, a disappointing purchase for me."
3,Decent product,"I purchased the calf compression support in an effort to ease the pain of vericose veins when playing basketball. I got the large, which was recommended because of my calf measurement. After wearing it a couple of times, I've realized it's really too small for me. It provides excellent compression, but it's too restrictive for the heavy exersion of basketball. The last ime I wore it, I had to stop playing in the middle of a game to remove it because it was causing me pain."
3,Non Fiction,"If you do slog your way through all of this you will probably come up with something useful. It did find out one or two things in here that solved problems we were having at the time, so it was certainly useful from that point of view. If that happens, the books have paid for themselves, in effect."
3,Mediocre book on 2000 Server,"I bought this book with very high expectations after being extremely happy with previous Secrets books. After reading through much of the book I found that it only answered about 50% of the questions I had concerning 2000 Server where the previous Secrets books had answered 90% or more of my questions. I don't think this book was written up to the standards of the previous ones. I would not use this as my only, or even primary guide to 2000 Server."
5,Perfect Little Gift,Beautiful scents..perfection for my friend who loves Issey; male and female. Loved the variety; Can wear according to mood. Great to ravel with as well.
5,Iluminate para que veas mejor,"Por lo general vivimos a oscuras. Nuestro mundo es una juguetería, cuando nos golpeamos con los anaqueles de los juguetes pensamos que estamos salado, que tenemos mala suerte y no observamos el objeto con el cual nos estamos tropezando. Resulta que la buena y la mala suerte NO EXISTEN.Con este libro aprenderás a ver los problemas como una oportunidad. Ya que la llama de la iluminación tiene varias funciones y una de estas es el discernimiento o mejor dicho la capacidad de ver con claridad los jugetes en los anaqueles y poder escojer. El mundo está lleno de bendiciones y oportunidades aprovechalas, ya que nuestro tiempo aquí es muy corto."
5,"All About John Deere for Kids, part 1","My grandson LOVES this video. The moment he arrives in the morning at our house, he starts insisting that the DVD be on."
3,Print cartridges/color missing,I purchased the Lexmark Twin Pack #17 Black and #27 Color Print Cartridges because they were such a good price. The cartridges were fine except the color cartridge was missing the color Yellow which makes it difficult to print anything with clarity. Not sure if I will try this product again.
2,You get what you pay for,"When I received my cartridges, the ink was GONE. The empty cartridges had been crammed back into the box, which was shoddily resealed with hot glue. Visual inspection would quickly reveal that the package had been tampered with. Even holding and shaking it gave away it's hollow contents. How in the world did this get through sales and end up reaching the consumer?Although the seller sent me another box to compensate, I'm still unhappy with what happened. The mere fact that an empty product could pass so easily probably means that they're not very observant with their products.If you're willing to take the risk and deal with the hassle of returns or refunds, go ahead. If you want something straight-forward, go buy from someone else."
3,Affordable but not durable.,"Honestly I brought this set because of the price, but this isn't a set that last long term. I have a smooth top range, I followed the care instructions and my pots still warped on the bottom. Half of the set are already thrown out. I won't be purchasing this set again. Maybe I would recommend this afforadle set to those who have a gas range."
2,Xmas hat,"Doesn't stand up like picture..falls to the side. I won't use it. Bad buy. Merry Xmas ,,,,,,,,,I can't say more!"
3,"Cute and a hoot, but slips off my head",This was a hit at my office holiday party. Only thing is that it kept slipping off when I tilted my head.
2,LarryReview,"The CD was described as being in a good condition. However, track #6 had a scratch on it that meant that the track coul not be played (I played the CD on a number of players to see the effect of the scratch). The remainder of the CD's tracks were fine. It's a pity that I didn't get all of Larry Carlton."
2,The Brabanti Baby - Catherine Spencer,"I think Catherine Spencer is a great writer, and I usually try to get all her books. She has always maintained a high standard in her writing.While this story is reasonably good, I do not think it is up to her usual standard. I find that when the editors ask a number of authors to follow a theme it tends to fall flat, never mind how good an author is."
4,"Great Curious George Book, won't last forever","Fun Curious George book, nice older style illustrations. The flaps won't last forever if your kids play with it at all but that is true of all lift the flap books. Large book so it is great for little ones to see but not as handy for taking on the go. Overall a fun book for kids!"
3,"Intriguing, gritty stuff","I'm a sucker for books about real life serial killers (yet trust me, I'm still a pretty nice guy) and this one (which was later made into a solid HBO movie) delivered the goods. What made it especially interesting was the Russian setting and how it focussed on the frustration of the lead investigator who wanted to use modern psychological techniques to track the killer, but was stifled by the communist political system he worked in. This real life story is somewhat remindful of the fictional plot of The Alienist, with the key difference being that in Caleb Carr's novel psychology is a brand new science, whereas in the non-fiction Citizen X psychology is simply foreign to criminal investigation in the Soviet Union."
5,Should Have Been There,"A great concert to be sure, my complaint being too many audience shots(at least it's a very entertaining bunch of 65,000 or so) & slow down the editing please(a usual beef). At times you see more of the audience than you do of the band.That aside, AC/DC always rock and the crowd loves them, I wish crowds up here would be as crazy as the South Americans. A night well worth capturing on video & well worth watching & buying."
3,WARNING:Will probably make you dizzy!!!!,"THE PROS:Looks and sounds great! And the performance was really good.Although im sure the vocals had to be slightly tweaked.THE CONS:As another reviewer stated,way to many camera switches,split screens and audience shots.I want to see the band not some shirtless guy with his mug so up close in the camera that you can see his boogers.Disappointed in the filming of this.From now on im going to wait and read reviews on concert dvds before i purchase to make sure their not filmed this way.There's too many concert dvds out there like this and i hope it stops!Its sorta nauseating.THE BOTTOM LINE:Get it to fill the gap in your collection if you have to but i would suggest just sticking to Live at Donnington or Plug Me In.Or better yet,save your money and put it on the great ""Let there be rock"" box set thats coming out."
1,Hard-Core Rock n Roll,AC/DC is always Great. The Band gets 5 Stars. The Editing gets minus 5. I cannot understand why they let these Morons mess up something great with their idiotic editing. The flipping of scenes every four beats is totally distracting and irritating. It takes so much away from the content. I just leave the TV on and go in the other room and listen. They may as well have made it a CD.
4,Maybe a bit overpriced on Amazon...but fairly good nevertheless,"There are 4 DVDs in this package and the ones that contain the ""Firestorm"" documentary and the documentary on Joseph Goebbels seems to be very interesting and good. The one on Goebbels shows quite a bit of extra footage & information that helps understand better Hitler and the nazi parties rise to power. The one on the undeground tunnel system.....I dont know how much I believe the story on the underground tunnels, etc..but I guess it is something don't hear much about and altogether,,,if you can get this DVD set for around $20- $ 25 you might feel it was worth it. But again I think it is a bit over priced on Amazon. at ""$35 or more."
5,Insightful,"This book, which is a series of quotes from people that knew Mike Bloomfield and Bloomfield quotes is a terrific way to learn about the life of one of the most incredible musicians of all time. I thought I knew a bit about him (I even knew about the Macdonalds coffee machine) but I really came to understand his life. His contributions are way greater than I had imagined. His difficulties were far greater than I had imagined. A great book, a great man."
3,A little odd,"This novel wasn't well-written. Not anything much really happens til the end and it's not that interesting even then. For the whole first half of this novel I just thought ""this is a strange novel."" And ""what is the point?"" The main character is obsessed with her height -- we are reminded she is tall 50 times at least. And it took me a while to figure out what year we were in. Hmmm...Smurfs and Barry Manilow -- late 70's? I also couldn't figure out why the character Gwendolyn is in the novel since she had no influence on any character.Still, three stars for a decent, happy ending, quick read, and some good insight into how divorce affects teens and their relationships with others in the family."
4,Short and Sweet,This is the first novel Sarah Dessen ever published. It's very short but its a good read. It shows Sarah's style of writing pretty easily. She really dipitcs how a teenage girl thinks and the problems and struggles that goes on in our minds. Like all of her books this one has debth which is very unlike most chick teen novels. There is always a lessen learned at the end of the book.The bad thing about this book is that it's very quick. I could give a quick overview in about 5 minutes and you would know the whole book. Nevertheless it's a good day read.
4,Great read,"I really enjoyed this book. With the theatrical release of ""the sisterhood of the traveling pants"", I re-read that book and read the 2 sequels then got on a ""teen read"" kick. I'm 34 and have read many teen books in my life. This one is great."
5,A Book Of Insperations,"That Summer is just a amazing book, one that you remember for the rest of your life. Its about growing up on the inside and outside. In short Sarah Dessen writes a compelling book that brings a much needed freah breeze to the teen literary world. Buy This Book!!"
3,"Muted, a little drab","My daughter loves the novels of Sarah Dessen and she recommended this one to me. It had a good enough premise but failed to elicit any emotion from me at all. The protagonist was slightly lacking in personality and didn't grab me. The one thing that piqued my interest was the young woman who came home after suffering a mysterious breakdown during her modeling career; unfortunately, that was but a mere sideline. Maybe Dessen needs to explore that facet and write a more interesting novel based on that character next time."
4,that summer,this book was rated a 4.i really hope that people consider reading this book.it was wonderful in many ways! try it out!
2,What's the Point?,"Imagine, if you will, that five of the six Pythons, save Eric Idle, have passed on. Ceased to be. Gone to meet their maker. Now, imagine, Eric trying to keep the group going -- by himself. Also imagine, if you will, the only Rutle not to perform on the Rutles LP carrying on without any of the actual playing Rutles. That in a nutshell is the feeling one gets listening to this CD.But the other Pythons (save Graham Chapman) are still alive and producing. Check out their recent BBC special if you can and also check out Neil Innes' recent solo compilation, ""Recollections 1"" (available through neilinnes.org).As for this album, this is not an album for listening to. It's an album for laying down and avoiding."
4,Great so Far !!!,"My husband and I have been ttc for approx. 2 yrs now. I am on clomid to help ovulation and he has had a vasectomy reversal (the odds are stacked against us). I have been drinking this tea for 4 days now, 2 cups a day, and I already see differences in my CM as well as my sex drive! I'm not going to get my hopes up too high but I am very optimistic! The tea itself is actually not as bad as I thought it would be. It has a mint taste to it and you will deff need a strainer unless you want tea leaves in your teeth! =D I add a packet of splenda and a little cream and enjoy a cup in the a.m. and the p.m. Hopefully I will get good results from the product... I'll be sure to keep you posted!"
5,After 9 months of trying...I'M PREGNANt!,I have been TTC for nine months. I tried other things before this tea but didn't have luck. I ordered this tea and started drinking it during AF. I ovulated 15 days later and I'm so happy to report that I'm pregnant! The flavor is very mild and enjoyable. Especially compared to the Chinese herbs I was taking. Blah!
1,Didn't know it's not for women with regular cycle,"My cycle is usually between 26-30 days. I started drinking this tea first day of my cycle. I didn't drink it everyday but probably 5 days a week. Two weeks later, on day 15th day of my cycle, which is around my ovulation, I had abdominal pain, lower back pain, chill and nausea, I thought I caught some stomach flu. But what followed surprised me, I started bleeding. It was more than spotting, like starting of my period but not heavy. The moments I sat down or got up or when I walk, my tummy hurt. This had never happened to me before. The tea is only thing I can think of changed. I felt better the next day and the bleeding is less the next day. But I wonder when this bleeding will stop and when my next cycle will begin. I think they should put the warning on the product."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I usually have a 28-30 day cycle, since taking the tea the last 2 cycles were only 25 days(which I didn't mind). On both those cycles I ovulated on CD 12. I don't really have a problem getting pregnant but I miscarried last Oct. 15 so I thought of taking this tea to help me heal and regulate my cycle again.I love the taste of the tea with a little hint of mint. I put a dab of sugar. My husband likes it a lot too, he sometimes drink more than I do. I usually stop drinking after a confirmed ovulation in case I'm pregnant.One more benefit that I got from this tea was that My allergy(environmental) symptoms really decreased to 80-95%. I used to take zyrtec everyday with a nasal spray and now I'm not even taking any of those junk anymore.We just found out this am that I am pregnant 10DPO. After this pregnancy I will definitely drink this tea again."
5,worked for me and two of my friends,"I tried to get pregnant for nine months (I was 42 at the time), with no luck. Even tried IUI and clomid. Then I tried this tea and got pregnant within a month. I have a 13 month old baby girl now. Two of my friends also got pregnant while drinking the tea. I can't say there is a direct cause-effect relationship but it's sure worth trying. I didn't mind the taste either."
4,So far so good,"Just finished my first cycle of fertility tea. It lengthened my luteal phase from 11 days to 14 days; what I had 2 years ago.PMS symptoms are significantly less, I usually need about 12 ibuprofens, wine and sleep on day 1; today I took 2 ibuprofens and am doing ok.The tea tastes fine. I had it two to three times a day with EPO, also had B complex and prenatal.I have vitex tincture also and added a few drops to my fertility tea one day and felt a little crazed; so will probably do that when I can't drink the tea.This upcoming month I am adding Fertile CM and will see how that goes."
4,Great tasting tea,"Too early to say if it works or not, but it does taste good. A very light refreshing tea with a hint of mint."
1,not hunting the treasure,i expected some adult stuff in it. but not realy worth to buy this cd. only some topless scenes which is not good.
2,not enough support,product was suggested by an erogonomics specialist to use in my car.This might be ok to use with an office chair but not in a car and especially not if long distance driving is involved.
1,"Uncomfortable, company has poor return policy","This support did not fit the bucket seat in my car. It made my back hurt and made me feel unstable when I was driving. Unfortunately this company has a very strict return policy. If the cushion is not in it's original packaging, they don't accept it for returns. Buyer beware!"
1,"The Therapy Connection at HPMS, Inc. is unfair in their return policy.","I returned the Original McKenzie Super Roll Lumbar Roll in it's original UNOPENED package..brand new never used, followed all the return instructions to the letter including get an return authorization number, insuring and getting a record of delivery, paid for the postage both ways and The Therapy Connection at HPMS, Inc. deducted my return $10.00!! Essentially, I paid about $35-$40 for this useless item and was refunded $15.52. I found this completely unreasonable. If I had opened the package even I might understand but it was BRAND new and NEVER opened from it's SEALED package. The roll is very uncomfortable and did nothing for my back. It is not worth it. Don't bother."
3,Just too firm,"It's hard to know when you order a product on-line, but for me, this roll was just too firm. I need something for the lumbar area, but this is not it."
3,Clint Eastwood Cop Vidio Collection,"I had never seen these movies before buying this collection. The stories were Clint Eastwood in nature, but I didn't realize that they had all that nudity in them, that wasn't nessesary to get accross the themes. Probably would not have got them if I knew."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Lighting fast shipping, exactly what I needed at a crucial moment! Very impressed how quickly I received this product at an international APO address."
5,Works just like it states,"I have purchased recycled ink before, and there is no difference to me in quality at all. The only thing you might find annoying, is that the printer itself wil tell you the ink is low, just because of the printer cartridge.. Awesome product, awesome results"
5,Great reference,"This book provided myself and my collegues with terrific answers to frequently asked questions. The easy to read format is great. Information on pumps (brands, prices, etc.) is also included. As the title suggests, there is a plentiful account of conditions and diseases. It is a fabulous reference and I highly recommend it!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I wasn't sure how well this silicone skin case would work, but I was pleasantly surprised - it is great! Very substantial - I am not worried that I will drop the media player or that it will get banged or as scratched up! Also, I was worried the buttons wouldn't work, but I actually find the buttons EASIER to use with this case on than without! I am very pleased. Well worth the reasonable price. If you have this media player, buy the cover!"
2,Dissapointed.,Belt Clip pointless. no screen protector. it does its job to protect the mp3 player but not the greatest on the market. for the price its ok. but i wouldnt buy it again.
5,Hair Metal At Its Finest,"If you had anything to do w/ the 80s, early 90s hair metal scene, this is a must own. A highly underrated band. Milli can hit notes no one even comes close to. Take the songs ""Steelheart"" or ""Sheila""...it doesn't get any better than this. Screaming like a maniac. If these songs don't get you going, give it up. It was a shame that a concert accident halted the momentum of this up and coming band. A great cd for any collection of the genre."
1,didn't receive from SKY BOX sellor,"My credit card was charged 11/09/07, however never received, as of 12/11/07 waiting for reply from sellor."
3,Crude but Works,"Pros:- Adjustment for latch position- Gentle lead in for the spring boltCons:- One supplied wood screw snapped off at the head- The adjustment plate sticks out- Not the same screw centers as the old plateYou'll need a hammer and wood chisel in addition to a Phillips screw driver to install this strike, the holes are a good bit wider. One of the supplied wood screws snapped off ~1/4"" from the head just as I was tightening the screw. The screws need to be very tight for the adjusting teeth to hold.Bottom line: My entry door is tight against the weather seal with the ability to make it firmer if need be."
5,Everyone knows this game is awesome.,We bought the PS2 version because our PC version had a lot of glitches and eventually stopped working all together. No problem whatsoever with this version.
5,Can't wait...,"I have always been a big PC gamer, and disliked console games. Too childish, I thought. Not interesting. Until the holy day Grand Theft Auto III was out. For this game, and this game only, I bought a Playstation 2. So far, the only games I got on my PS2 are GTA3 and GTA3 Vice City. And man those games rock ! I can't wait for the new one to be there, my PS2 has been so desesperately cold for too long !!! I'm addicted !"
1,horrible game,"very boring, very difficult to play, and very bad graphics and storytelling. I remember trying very hard to play it, but I would end up getting frustrated, rather than enjoying playing it. I ended up giving it to someone or throwing it away...don't remember, but I did get rid of it"
2,Its coming to Xbox foolish person,"With a better version than on PS2 probably March 2005... JUST LIKE GTA DOUBLE PACK, WHERE IT TOTALLY BLEW THE PS2 VERSION AWAY. And Xbox has the best slection of games by far and the best RPGS, not just the best FPS (though it does have those). Star Wars KOTOR, Fable, etc. THOSE BLOW AWAY FINAL FANTASY. Not that I hate FF. I totally respect the series, and its a great series btw, but it just doesent compare to xbox rpgs. I STILL HAVE A PS2 AND XBOX BUT XBOX IS BETTER BY FAR. But PS2 is a decent system because it has a great exclusive game like, uh, whats exclusively good on ps2 and only on ps2? cant think of anything now but, uh, whatever... I DIDNT GIVE IT 5 STARS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE ITS NOT OUT YET, BUT ILL PROBABLY REVIEW IT AGAIN WHEN IT COMES OUT, AND GIVE IT WHAT IT DESERVES WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE A 5/5 CUZ IT LOOKS SO COOl! btw by reading a preview on this site i just learned you can swim so cool."
4,Seems a little short,"I know there was quite a bit of hype going into this game about it's length (200+ hours,) but it is really short. I mean, it has a much wider variety of missions and all, but the game just comes up a little short. I beat it in 66 hours. While it was more entertaining than Vice City and 3, it really didn't appeal to me as much as those two. The story didn't sink in as much. Maybe it's because I like the 80's more than the 90's, or maybe SA just came up a little short."
1,I Can't Steer!,"I tried to play this game for 15 minutes.First off, the game was so dark that even after I turned up the brightness on the game and some on my TV, I still could barely see what the hell I was doing.The fact the analog wouldn't shut off and I had to use the joy stick to steer anything? I kept crashing over and over again because I couldn't keep control.The game sucks!"
3,"GTA, GTA, GTA...","It's a GTA game, of coarse it's fun. Bikes are a great add on, gang conflict is a fun concept. Good songs."
5,No better bang for the buck,"If you have the money get this monitor. All other monitors this size are at least hundreds more. This monitor is 24"" widescreen, contains over 2.3 million pixels is so bright you have to turn it down in order not to burn your retinas, and has 1000:1 contrast ratio with a response time of 16ms (meaning ghosting is barely noticeable). This monitor has great features like Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-picture, and takes 5 different inputs (vga, dvi, s-video, component, composite) has a great menu with lots of options and settings you can adjust, as well as 4 usb ports, and an 9-in 1 media card reader. The stand is height adjustable, and the monitor can be swiveled, rotated or positioned and way you like, including vertically. The only thing to watch out for is that on dvi settings are limited, and dead pixels do occur, but these are problems with every lcd monitor. All in all there is no better value for the money."
1,video game,"I am disappointed in this particular order, its my fault that I didn't do my homework first about the video game ratings for kids. I ordered it for a neighbor child and was surprised at the content, so I had to order him something else more appropriate for preteens. I do not recommend any game of this nature for young children. I am having a little trouble getting rid of it, because I am told I bought an old version of it. I know nothing about these games, the company that shipped it hasn't returned my call yet, and no one answers the phone there (Kamco). Buyer beware of hard to return items, Amazon has an excellent return policy. I just wished they were the ones to send it."
5,Kill that noise,all you people hating on this game just cause the main character is black is stupid. if you don't like the game that's cool but to dislike a game cause dude is black is just stupid. i didn't complain when every other videogame on the planet had white characters. they even gave a hedgehog his own game before giving a black dude one so just kill that noise.bottom line is the game is hot. (...)
2,What the F***?!?,"I absolutly loved this game when I first got it. I had it for over 7 months. On Wednesday 11/9, I decided to sell some of my game to get 50 Cent Bulletproof. I did not sell this game because I liked it. I went into EB Games and the manager said that Target, Walmart, Kb toys, and even more stores have band it from the stores. It got band because when you unlock the scene when the women get naked in the streets, it is illegal to have in a game. Rockstar has changed the game rating to ""A"" for adults only!!! It doesn't say on the package though. Sell this game immediately. If you go to EB, You will get a $7 store credit. I am not lying. Don't be sick in the head..."
5,Does anyone really care what little 10 or 11 year olds think?,"All kids writing reviews for this game should go back to playing pokemon or yugioh or whatever you little kids play. Write a review for some gay kid game. We adults can play these games cause were old enough. We have been around much longer then you, and we all have superior knowledege over you. We have jobs and work hard to make a living. If you want a game you beg your mommiesor daddies for it until you get it and write something that does not make any sense. When you expirience the real world, you will know soon enough what I mean. Until then, let pokemon raise you and not Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."
1,Crappy,"Ok, first of all, i just want to say that i am not rating this game a 1 because it's too violent or there's to much sex. I don't mind violence and the sex is optional. I actually have complaints about how this game PLAYS.This game is huge. it's bigger than Vice Ctity, or Haven City (Jak II). It starts off fun, killing people and doing the missions and bonus games. But, then you notice that you've already done these things before (especially if you've played the other GTA games). All the missions are are basically 'Go here', 'kill him', 'go there and get this', ETC. Its pathetic, to say the least.And the graphics are pretty bad, especially when you look at things like Jak 3 and Metal Gear Solid 3, or even Burnout 3 (yeah, I know thats alot of 3's, so how about Sly 2?).Over all, this is a below average game that is too over hyped. Unfourtunatly, people are beleiving the hype."
1,The godfather was killed by Ludacris,"The orginal gta was the best game i ever saw go to console. The third and vice city were excellent. You had a touch of godfather in the third and scarface in vice city. San Andreas totally rids the reputation of GTA. No longer do you work with class, but as a low moral, dirty hoodlum. I dispise this game and can't wait for the next GTA, which will hopefully not be so lame."
2,an extended vice city,"Ok...sure the game is bigger, but it is the same exact thing as vice city, with minor changes. I thought this game was insane, until I realized how long it would take me to beat missions that were exactly like the rpevious two games. I go to a friends house who is on the third island and...OOOOOHHHHH mission where you pick someone up on a mountain and drop them off at a hotel! WOW! Anyway Halo2 is a much better game and it made me realize how this game is poor."
3,GTA San Andreas,"I`ve really liked the new story about the caracter and stuff, but my complain is about the awful scenario quality. All right, the huge dimension of the city is really an encouraging fact to play, but the landscape is not well done. The cars are fine and, in fact, very nice, but the water is really terrible. For a plataform like PS2, the water could be drawn better. Mario Sunshine for Game Cube has a perfect water. It looks too much real. Sometimes I wish I could swim in that water. The new gta water is dirty. However, generally speaking I`ve like the game, excpeting the previously told problems. The planes are fantastic, the city is good and if anyone from the amazon would like to send me this gta as a gift I wouldn`t complain about it. [...]"
4,to much gangster,this game all about gangsters i mean its all yo whats my homie and that kind of crap. and all you do is kill people on missions. yes it is fun to play but it gets boring after a week. there are a lot feature such as u can swim. its a good games but i recomand to rent it like i did and see if u like FIRST then buy. they did banned it from stories like bestbuy. bcause of to much volince. i like vice city better thats why i own it.
1,GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 WAS COOL . . . . .,"Grand Theft Auto was pretty easy to beet . But Anyway , the other parts of the game were AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,60 Minutes...you don't get it,"I've been wanting to write a review for this game and 60 Minutes on Sunday inspired me to do so now. Video Games do not kill people, they do not program people to kill people. This is a fun game, good for many hours of play and when you finally finish it you will feel like you accomplished something (although that is debatable). Gameplay is solid, graphics are good, not great, and overall it is just fun. Short and sweet, but if your going to actually shoot someone, don't blame it on this game please."
5,stunning!,"This is a stunning cd! An excellent quartet of outstanding musicians. DeJonnette is especially compelling in his percussion work. And this is a wonderful showcase for bassist Favors and pianist/composer Davis. I'm especially pleased to hear the underrecorded Davis. Smith's work is crisp, especially in his tribute to Lester Bowie. If you're a fan of any of these musicians, or of the AACM, I strongly recommend purchasing this cd."
5,I Love this CD!,"I'm only 14 and a big Buddy Holly Fan! I'm glad that this CD has alot of songs that he did before he became really big most CDs are ""The BEST of"" , ""The GREATEST hits""... ect. But this has alot of his songs from 56 TO... 59.~NEVER Fade Away~ Brandi Bushong"
4,Perfect for my 2 year old twins.,"My 2 year old twins have fallen in love with Toy Story. I already had a Woody doll, but my I knew son would love having a Buzz doll. I searched for a plush Buzz and this is the one I found that I liked the best. Other soft plush Buzz dolls looked too distorted. I ordered it with ease, and it was shipped promptly. I like the quality, and just as suspected, my son carries it with him throughout the day. It is also the perfect size for him. Not too bulky. I recommend this product. Perfect for what I needed."
4,Science kits,"These kits are not perfect, but anything my boys can do by themselves and it gets them away from the video games is great!"
4,Comentario Sobre la Edicion En Dvd de Eva Luna,"Exelente Dvd!!! Contiene lo mas importante de la Historia, Muy Dinamico. Lo unico que no me gusto fue que en el Final falta la Escena del Final de Renata, cuando Leonardo le dispara y ella minutos despues muere, sin ser eso, lo demas esta muy bien. Me Gusto Muchisimo!!!"
5,Foster is Supreme!,"I'll forego the description, since that's been done. I love Lori Foster's comedic style. She's tops in this genre and always delivers a good read. I loved the secondary characters with this one and the (...) chemistry between free-spirited Luna and confirmed bachelor, hottie Joe. The two teenagers add more flavor to the story. One great read!"
3,Definitely a fluff chick lit book,"It's an average chick lit book to say the most. It's not bad, but it's also not one of the books I would want to read again. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library. That seems to be typical for me with any Lori Foster book. I enjoy it for it's fluffiness and the fact that it allows me a nice escape, but some of her stuff is just so cheesy. With that said, I plan on reading the next book in this series (and hopefully all of the books in the series). Maybe the next one will impress me more."
4,Great Book,I picked this book up at the library and was surprised that I liked it so much. Joe is a cousin the the Winston brothers that have their own stories which I have yet to read but definitely will after reading Say No To Joe. Joe wants Luna and Luna needs help from Joe but doesn't want her heart broken since Joe tends to be a love em and leave em guy. Joe agrees to help Luna when she moves to take care of orphaned cousins she didn't know she had. Somebody wants them out of town though and Joe is along to help find out who. Luna eventually gives Joe a chance and they fall in love. Secondary characters in this book are set up for their own stories which I can't wait to read.
2,Overwhelming Unabridgement...Yawn,"Overall, the plots and storylines were actually pretty good. The only problem was that we had to withstand so many pages of boring material to get to the interesting plot. This book could have been done with almost half the pages it has. By the time I was done with the book, I was too numb to actually appreciate the ending, as good as it was. I'm not a big fan of the abridged version of books, but this one could still have been shortened and called unabridged. This is my first experince with a Pottinger book, and will be the last."
1,Is The DVD Cover Familiar To You?,"This is a pure Rip-Off from the cover of Aerosmith's Live Bootleg album from 1978...Where's the shame? Too bad Twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover.In another words, this DVD is pretty suck and the originality here is nowhere to be found...Especially on the cover art that they stole from a much bigger band."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie is really a good one. Really gives true view of what the playboy clubs were like. The funniest part would have to be when they all dance to ""The Stripper"". A must see movie!"
5,An amazing tour of the most beautiful rose gardens.,If you enjoy flowers and horticulture history this video will be a delightful surprise.
2,Paint brush charm,I don't remember seeing any details about size and was disappointed to find that it was only about 1/2 long. Cute cut only as a charm on bracelet.
4,Swiss Army Knife of IT Best Practice Material,"Joel covers a multitude of topics and while I dont agree with him on everything, there is plenty of worthwhile material to make the book part of any IT career proficiency plan. I was especially grateful to find a lot of practical ideas toward best practices in IT environments. He devotes significant discussion to effective communication within and without the department.One of the more interesting things about Joels' book is that it is not just prescriptive; for the most part he tells you how he has come to his conclusions. This helps the reader decide to agree or disagree based on the readers own circumstancesJim Wolf, M.A. Organizational DynamicsIT Documentation and CommunicationUSIS Background Screening"
3,Mono Bizzaro,"Mondo Bizzaro being Ramones 12th and 1992 release is what I would consider a punk rock light release. There are elements of punk rock but on the whole it is more of a rock release. Compared to earlier releases such as Rocket to Russia this album is not as good. The best track is their cover of Doors ""Take it as it comes"". Allmusic gave it 3.5/5 and Rolling Stone gave it 3. The album is a weak 3.5 but since I can not give it this then it gets 3. 3/5."
4,Love these!,"Suuuuper comfortable!!! They are very soft and you know they're there but only barely! And minimal to no panty line! I go horseback riding and I always wear these because sitting in a saddle with thick undie seam is NOT comfrotable! Totally recommend them! My only complaint is that you're not supposed to use fabric softener cause they get little fuzzies stuck and it's annoying, but they're still comfortable at least!"
5,"Aaahhhhh,....Latoya.","I purchased this disc when it first came out and, to this day, I'm still playing it. I don't understand why it didn't do better. Probably because people don't know good music when they hear it. This disc is AWESOME and each and every track is tailor-made for her voice. There weren't any ""screeching"" songs (tracks that are overblown on the vocals) because they weren't needed. Her voice is sooo smooth and intoxicating, and if anyone is keeping count, my favorites are LEARN TO BREATHE and HOW I LOVE THE RAIN. Classics, I say! I wish someone...anyone...would pick this girl up and give her another chance, because with this disc, she truly deserves it!"
4,State of the Heart ...,"... idiot radio programmers, release this song. This girl is showing much more on record than I ever saw on TV (finally real emotion). Give her the break she deserves. Bravo!"
4,Great costume,I love the costume. It's cute and well made. It does run small so definitely order one size larger than your usual dress size.
1,not what I hoped for,"I purchased and received 3 leather and sterling silver cords to hang my families crosses on them. Everyone of them fell apart out of the package. Not very good quality, not worth the money, but shipping them back would have added to their cost, so we just tossed the in the trash. Good money down the drain."
2,Impossible to easily put on and take off,"This is a nice looking leather cord necklace. Unfortunately, if you are over the age of 3 with adult sized hands and fingers, it is practically impossible to get this cord on and off. The tiny, poorly designed spring-ring clasp is impossible to open and close easily. And trying to undo this clasp from behind your neck is extremely cumbersome. I am having to slip it on and off OVER my head. Clasp needs to be made for ADULTS! Same comments apply to the 7.5 inch leather cord bracelet. Your designs were obviously not tested with real adults. NOT GOOD."
3,It's okay but not anything really special.,"Sort of like the GTA series but a little different.I play this game every once in a great while.Liked I said nothing special.I've only played it for a few minutes at at a time,about maybe 3 hours worth.Graphics are good."
4,Decent faucet for the price,"I purchased this as an emergency replacement for an old kitchen faucet about a month ago. It works well and the chrome finish still looks new. For a basic, low-tech and simple faucet, this does the trick and at a very reasonable price."
5,perfect,"This little backpack is just what i wanted, small, cute and the right colors (OSU buckeyes!). I am very pleased."
4,Very Good,"Needed to have this book for my bible study class. Once I started reading it - quite informative. Thanks for having it, not I can be part of the discussion."
1,Beware: Product image may not match description,The image for this product may not match the actual product for a super short magnum casing.Product I ordered by mistake a while back was 223 WSSM (Winchester Super Short Magnum) with a case diameter of 0.544 inches and a case length of 1.67 inches.223 ammunition for AR-15s has a case diameter at the shoulder of 0.354 inches and a case length of 1.76 inches.
1,possibly the worst of the lot,"Not a great coffee-maker. My experiences with ""Mr Coffee"" products have all been pretty negative and this was the worst. It was a gift, so, what the heck, I gave it several tries. It sprayed water all over the counter while making one cup, the coffee was awful.Skip it!"
2,poor choice,"As stated above, the double pod holder is too big for standard pods. This results in lightly tinted water being brewed. The single pod holder does a better job and delivers a passable cup of coffee. The selling point for me is that you use your cup to fill the reservoir each time you brew so there is no water sitting there to go bad if you don't use the device a lot, which, because of its poor engineering, I won't."
3,Great...until the end,"I was thoroughly enjoying this book until about 3/4 of the way through. The action was interesting, the characters somewhat fleshed out...then the author hit a brick wall. ****SPOILERS****The heroine seduces the hero, both declare their love, then the morning after hits and VOILA, suddenly the heroine admits she doesn't want to marry the hero! If there had been legitimate concerns, okay, I'd have bought it, but the remainder of the book felt contrived, like the author was just trying to fill a specific word count. There were obstacles that the author could have--should have!--used like the father's objections or her would-be fiancee, but instead, it's simply lame. Then, when the author reaches her desired word count, the REAL issues are never resolved. The hero and heroine agree to marry and all the other issues are simply forgotten. HORRIBLE ending. It really ruined this book for me. If not for the ending, this book would have been 4 or 5 stars."
3,new camera user,"I like the gorillapod because of it's flexibility. Even after tightening the ball head attachment as much as I could, it still didn't do a very good job of holding my heavy (Cannon 50D) camera in place. After fiddling around and adjusting the Gorillapod a bit, I was able to make it work. Regarding delivery of the products: Amazon has always delivered as they promised and on time. I also returned the larger size Gorillapod (to Amazon.com) because when I recived it, I thought it was too big and bulky. Their return process was amazingly simple!"
2,dont base it on the video game!,if you are thinking this is giong to be as cool as the video game you might be suprised how much this movie messed up the great image I had for the game! the action is well lame! but you will learn more about the people then you do thru the video game!
1,Beware,"Do not believe this book. Hiring a realtor is the BEST way to sell your house. I tried to use this book and lost thousands of dollars and ended up hiring a realtor anyways. The keys to selling a house are advertising and having a way for buyers and their realtors to see your house at all times of the day. This book does NOT provide adequate information on this, and you do need a realtor for the advertising and access to your house for showing."
3,Disappointed in packaging.,The item arrived damaged. It was not packaged properly and the black plastic bottom was broken. I did not return it because I needed to use it immediately. I am very disappointed and wish I could return it.
3,Decent if you can't afford a review course,"If you have the funds I highly recommend the Becker Convisor program. After I purchased the set of Wiley books I ended up doing the Becker program instead and found that their programs and materials were vastly superior. There's little in the way of explanation in the Wiley series and what they do explain you will have to struggle through. However, it all comes down to what you can afford. Most firms will pay for all your review expenses (as did mine), but if you have to pay for it yourself and you are short on funds you might want to just struggle through Wiley and save a thousand bucks."
1,"College work, not for traders","This book is like a college work, it's not for traders. It has a lot of tests, and says a lot about why not to use oscilators. But in the end is the feeling that this book was made for a college lecture, not for discussion with traders. Don't waste your money, nothing can be learned from this book."
3,"Hard, Dark, but not Deep...","If you're a fan of Lawler, tribal and dark, this may not be the album for you. I've been a strong fan of Steve, but this latest CD leaves me flat. Both previous Lights Out albums were dirty and gritty, giving the listener a taste of his Harlem Nights. You could always feel the ""Lawler"" in them, that tribal sound that we all love.But dance music has been moving in this direction for about a year, both Sander and Steve have been advocates. Unlike tribal house, this is very cerebral, techy stuff, not a lot of deep basslines, with some seriously screechy moments. While I always love a new version of Saints & Sinners, and Obsessive Sound is a gem, just when I get into this mix, it leaves me cold.If you're looking for where tribal is going, check out Saeed & Palash, DJ Vibe, Chus & Ceballos or Victor. The Spain/Portugal influences have been good for the progressive tribal sound."
2,Bad follow up to Lights Out 1 and 2,"Lights Out 1 and 2 were dark tribal masterpieces. 3 is way too electronic, with only one standout song near the beginning of disc 1. When he played at Avalon in Hollywood during his Lights Out 3 tour, he was amazing. I don't understand why this CD didn't have great songs on it. Mix CD's, especially those not recorded live at a club, should be a compilation of the some of the dj's best songs.My 3rd disc seems to be defective, as only 3 tracks play. Anyone else have this problem?"
3,Not a Strong Finale For Lawler's GU Subseries,"This album is not horrible, but I did expect a lot more from it for the simple fact that it's Steve Lawler AND the label is Global Underground!Disc 1 has (in my opinion) the three best tracks of the entire album with Ben Wijay's ""Wait"", ""Drop That Bomb"", and F.E.D.O's ""Happy Days Don't Stop"" (Fedo Range Mix). Everything in between is pretty ordinary, but OK.Disc 2 lacks for different reasons. There are no real stellar tracks, but the first six are enjoyable and establish a nice groove. The set is then interrupted by one of the worst tracks I've ever heard in a Steve Lawler set to date with Drax N Gooding's ""ABC"". There is a slight recovery with the next four tracks, but then the set completely falls apart at Saints & Sinners' ""Pushin Too Hard"" (Ricky Ryan Edit) right through to the end.Both discs get 3.5/5 stars."
3,a little long in the leg,"I have worn many pairs of these Lee pants. They are very tough and stand up to frequent washing.They are very comfortable and versatile, but lately I have noticed they are a little long. That would be fine with a high heeled boot, but I don't want to wear high heels. I have washed the pants in hopes they may shrink up! I am 5'7"" and usually ""average"" length is ok. I will have to hem these latest ones. But despite that, good pants!"
1,Different cut than before,"I have purchased this product in the past and loved the fit. Unfortunately, this time the rise (below the waiste) was nearly two inches shorter than the pants I ordered earlier. I had to return them. I received immediate, trouble-free refund."
3,Delivers what it promises,"This book is ok. I am unconvinced that it will help me to win any Lottos, but it is reasonably presented, if ultimately unconvincing (to me). Worth having a look at."
3,Gerri's Review,It is easy to understand the analysis of numbers and position of numbers frequencies as reference for determining lotto numbers. I feel the combinations and wheeling systems are too complicated for beginning lotto players like myself.
3,lotto book,"I've not won the lotto, but fun to read. Would not waste any money though on any of these books. Some parts of the book makes no since. If your going to win the lotto its not from reading this book."
2,sparse scriptural reference,A few golden nuggets are tucked away amongst the chapters of this book. The reference to scripture to back up and support his points and ideas is extremely scarce however. Instead he seems to use a lot of personal experience to support his keys. Athletes may find his references more to their liking.
3,What can you say.,"Its a toilet seat on a plastic bucket, what can you say? How about this:It came quickly and was cheap."
4,It's Crap...,... In the bucket that is. I am a commercial driver and bought this product (and liners) for emergency use only. You could use a 5 gallon bucket and a garbage bag instead if you don't mind a ring on your a-- from the bucket and the possible smell or breakage of the garbage bag. The Loo is simple and functional. It is a handy item to have when you are not close to any available facilities.
5,WYSIWYG (a.k.a. wizzy wig),"What you see is what you get -- a bucket and a seat. My 4-year-old used it while camping, which is all I was hoping for. We didn't test it for solids. Don't expect a watertight seal. Consider using some kitty litter in it for deodorizer."
5,Sigma 80-400mm EX OS APO RF lens,"I use this lens with these cameras, all Canon EOS: 30D, 40D, 5d Mk II. It works extremely well with all of them. There is a slight vignetting with the 5d Mk II, most observable when a circular polarizer is used at max polarization. Otherwise images are of very high quality. You can see some images here:http://lajuntablog.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccainpalin-rally.htmlThese were with the 40D from about 125 feet.and here:http://lajuntablog.blogspot.com/2008/08/dnc-protest-march.htmlalso with the 40D at distances of 50 feet to a couple of city blocks."
2,Had Potentials,The book has some pieces that are good but overall it does not really deliver.The style is kind of raw which is good but in some parts it gets repetitive and the story somehow loses the glue that holds the pieces together at the end.It feels like someone took the daily blog and put it into a book.would not recommend it.
3,"Vicious, Bitter, Scathing, totally Black Humor","That's the good part. The laugh-out loud for the first half of the book part. Some of the lines in this book are priceless.You'll snort on the bus. Giggle in a cafe. People will ask what you're reading.But somehow, it's not very satisfying. It's missing plot, character development, a point, or anything else you can hang your hat on and remember more than an hour after you read it.Writing (especially first half of book): 5 stars, easy.Everything Else: 1 star, maybe."
5,Laugh out loud (and make people in the airport stare at you),"APATHY is far and away the funniest book I've ever read! The humor is perfectly relatable to real life (if you've ever quoted ""Office Space"" or perhaps sat in the bathroom at work for an escape). I highly recommend this book if you want laugh-out-loud comedy!"
1,"no, no, no, no","The premise is not so bad: anti-hero in a dead-end job/world.The main character goes through this slice of his life completely cynical and overly dramatic about everything around him. Every encounter is the same thing: cynicism and hyperbole.At first, it was kind of funny, but by the end I was really tired of reading this. He doesn't progress, he doesn't have a valid point about anything, doesn't really face any conflicts... mainly just sleeps on the toilet until he gets fired for something stupid. Would have been much more interesting if he actually was trying to kill himself as the cover suggests."
3,A Small Victory,"The black comedy is bitter and laugh-outloud funny, but the main character, Shane, drove me crazy. He's not apathetic so much as a lazy bum. His ambitious girlfriend, Gwen, tries to kick his slacker butt into gear without much success--she seemed to be the only character in ""Apathy"" worth rooting for. Paul Neilan is a sharp and humorous writer, but the main character here never worked for me. A small victory indeed."
3,Dark comedy with some surprising moments,"Darkly comedic book with many laugh out loud moments. I think my major problem with this book was the reader started getting apathetic towards the main character. I wasn't rooting for him, I wasn't rooting against him either. He was telling his story and I didn't care. However, there were def moments where I was cracking up out loud, which caught me by surprise. I guess you should read it if you come across it, but, I don't think it's worth a full price purchase."
5,The Original Edition is the best for study,"While the ""30th anniversary edition"" was printed to honor Dr. Skousen for his wonderful work, you need to be aware of two things: First, if the goal is to flood the nation with The Five Thousand Year Leap, the original edition makes it so much more possible because of the huge discounts available from the publisher for quantity purchases. Also, the page numbers in all of the study guides, curriculum, work books, DVDs, and other learning helps that have been developed for this marvelous book correspond with the original version and will not change. The page numbers in the anniversary edition are completely different and make it very difficult to use with the other resources from The National Center for Constitutional Studies. I am a History teacher, and my students love the original!"
2,Feels good but empty,I read this as a young man. I was a mormon growing up and since Skousen was Mormon too I just ate up his ideas. There is a lot of mormon doctrine woven in the text. But the problem with the book is that he often exaggerates and cherry picks the data to support his preconceived ideas. I think it is fine to read but make sure you check the source for accuracy.
3,Hard for me to get into.,"While the content of the book is not an issue, the writing style seems to have thrown me. My mind simply refused to wrap itself around this book. It is likely a very good read for many others out there, but for myself it was a wasted purchase. At least for now. I am going to give it another go sometime in the next couple months to see if it will read better then.One note for those that are not religious. You won't like the religious spin in this book. It is very blatant and in your face throughout many of the chapters. If you can get past that particular facet of the book, you may actually enjoy the content."
3,"Good book, but contains some creationist nonsense.","In general, the book is well written and easy to understand. However, I found the section that goes into ""intelligent design"" tedious and very distracting from the important themes the book discusses. I really would like to recommend this to friends who believe in the power of top-down government, but this section is so completely logically inconsistent that I fear it throws the rest of the book's reasoning into question."
4,A Must Read!,"Considering this book was written 3 decades it is more prevelant today! The author takes you on a journey you may not want to go on. The 5000 year leap has insights that propel you forward to action. Read and then buy a copy for a family member, co-worker and neighbor!"
5,Best Book I've read in years!,"This book is one of the best two books I've read concerning conservatism ever! In the words of our founders, this book dispels the myths the Progressives have been spreading for the past 100 years about the foundations of this country. After reading this book, hearing the thoughts and reason of the founders, I have no doubt about the intent of our Constitution."
5,Timely information.,"What a great read. The information is timely in these days where the government seems to forget what our founding fathers ment by ""limited government"". Everyone should get a copy and read this book and pass it on to friends and family."
4,Could use a better waist/lumbar support,"I have had this pack for about a year now. All in all I have been very pleased with it. No problems with the zippers, bungee cords haven't broken yet, etc. The only thing is I wish they made a frame pack version with lumbar support and with side pocket storage. This would alleviate the off balance feel that the bag has when used as a day pack, and allow me to store reels at my side when not in use. I would also like more padding on the shoulder straps instead of the mesh style they use now."
2,Informed by Orientalist construction of India,"We can only wish that Khilnani had not depended so much on schoolbook ideas of India that the Marxists and liberal scholarship has peddled for the last half century. Khilnani is unable to understand contemporary movements of change. Ultimately, his book fails to illumine the notion of India."
4,A Journey Through Time,"John's book is a look back through time that I wish we could all make. This is an amazing journey into one man's lives and if you've ever had any interest in your past lives and their relevance to the life you live today, you'll see how John relates to his. I enjoyed the way he wove his past experiences together to walk the reader through the stories and see the meaning and knowledge he gained from each one. Each life is used as a stepping stone into the next. It's profound if you can remember the past in this lifetime and understand its importance and lessons in the present."
5,Best There is,"The Navajo Language is a fairly difficult language to learn, and there are few books out there that can teach you the Language. In general, cultural practices of the Navajo are seldomly documented and packaged for sale--it's a cultural thing. But this book is the most extensive book out there. Unlike what a previous reviwer claimed, THERE ARE english translations for the Navajo words in the book, including a glossary in the back. YOU WILL NEED THE TAPES to accompany this book!! You just can't read the book and learn the language---the tapes are required. Navajo is a very ""throaty"" language and it takes a lot of prctice to learn it. Furthermore, I would suggest buying the Navajo-English Dictionary after you have mastered the book."
4,Great TV For the price,Purchased this LCD TV For around $400.00 and it is great for viewing tv and Gaming. Although its far from the best as its only EDTV It still is a great choice if you want a cheap LCD TV. I have had it over 1 year with no problems. If your looking for an HDTV Though you will need to look elsewhere and pay more.
2,Does not fit!,My daughter is 11 months old and is small for her age. She is currently still wearing 6-9 months clothing. I purchased the 6-12 months size hat and it is way too small! I couldn't even get it to reach her ears and it was so tight that she started to cry! The hat is very cute though and is soft and thick. I have no choice but to send it back though.
1,too small!,I bought this for my 3 month old baby and it was too small for his head. My baby's head isn't big (his head circumference is in the 24 percentile) but this hat would not fit. I've wasted money on this item. 0-6 months??? More like 0-1 month!
2,too small,"I bought this hat and my baby only really got to wear it once, about a month ago. I bought the 0-6 month size. He is now 3 months old with a head circumference of around 16"", and the hat is so tight that it left a mark on his forehead after only being on for about 5 minutes yesterday. Now I have to either try to modify the hat by removing the elastic, as a previous reviewer suggested, or get another hat. It is also too deep, and you can't roll up the bottom to shorten it. I could've dealt with that, since it is a nice warm hat, but now it doesn't matter because it's so tight."
5,Simply Adorable,Absolutely adorable hat. I bought it to match the Bundle Me Cuddle for the stroller.Would recommend it for winter warmth.
3,Not as big as it looks,"The picture is fairly deceiving. It looks like you can fit 2 french loaves in the basket. If they were short, then you might be able to. I have found that it works well for breadsticks and rolls, but not loaves of bread. The basket material isn't very high quality, but it does its job. The cloth, though, is quite large and easily wraps around whatever you put in."
3,Like loving a neurotic ...,"I really like this watch; because it's so easy to set the timer, it's really made a difference in my life. I can set a reminder for 6 minutes from now, when I'm grilling and need to flip something. I can set the timer for 20 minutes, when I need to go pick someone up. I can set an alarm to wake up from a catnap. It's really easy to set the timer and so I use it all the time; it frees up my rapidly depleting brain cells for other things.Except when it breaks. Like other reviews have mentioned, the buttons fall off (my first watch) and the bezel has fallen off and gotten lost (my second watch). I'm about to buy my 3rd; I feel kind of stupid; it'll be the third in 4 years. I wish the quality was higher, but honestly, I'm not sure (with my quickly fading memory :-) if I can function without it."
2,Takes a licking and gives a pain.,"The watch is handsome, the band is superb, the functions [disappoint]!1. The directions are on a 12x15 sheet of paper in 15 languages, if all in English it would cover a 1x1 card.2.There is only a date, no day.3. After setting the alarm, it rings every 12 hrs.4.The stems have to be pulled out/set with 3 settings for each.5. There appears to be a compass, but it's only directions printed on the bazel for no apparent use.Basically, I had a better watch with more, easier functions 30 yrs. ago for [money]. What happenned TIMEX?"
4,Unexpectingly GREAT,I don't normally read romance books involving ministers or preachers because there is always a conflict with there calling and falling in love. With this story Bruce knew that his love for Cyn and God were not in competition with each and he was able to express both and not be worried or scared. And the major one thing I LOVED about this book is that Bruce and Cyn expressed their feeling almost immediately when they felt them they talked to each. Even Bruce admitted that he loved the fact that Cyn spoke here mind and her feelings. This was an exceptional love story. It's a hit everytime with Foster!!!
4,You're In For A Treat!!!,"At first I was not sure I was going to like this book. Why you ask after all it's Lori? Truth was I was not sure I was going to be able see Cynthia and Bruce together but...I had nothing to fear. Ms. Foster managed to make be believe that these two very, very different people were able to fall in love.As stated by a previous reviewer Ms. Foster's trademark sesuality was toned down a bit. Cyn is an ex-prostitute and Bruce is a preacher. Cyn has come from a very abusive life and Bruce is just the man to help her make a new life for herself. Ms. Foster was true to her character's and this has been my favorite out of the series so far.We get to see Joe and Luna as well as Shay and Bryan again when we visit Visitation. Jamie Creed is also very much active in this story and as a result this was a great page turner that I took on the road with me to Poland. I highly recommend Ms. Foster. You will never be let down by this author and I look forward to the next in this series."
4,Warm coat but hate the Zipper,I ordered a new Charartt coat but this new one has a double zipper that is hard to zip up. I don't know why Charartt went to a two way zipper and never heard of any complaints about the old zipper. Once it is zipped the coat is great! I have a old Carhartt with a one way zipper but after 25 years it was wearing out. It had a one way zipper and it was warm and the zipper worked great.
5,worth every penny,"This coat is so well made. A great tough, weather proof material that last forever. It's cute full, with extra spacer in the shoulder so you can move well without being restricted. Two inner pockets with closing flaps. Fully lined. This is an outdoor coat that can take what Winter dishes out, dry clean and look brand new. I purchases the Navy and it's super stylish.You cannot beat the value of this coat."
1,Wrong O2 Sensor for Honda Accord LX,This Bosch 15710 is a sensor specifically for the EX and SE Honda Accord models. Beware. The Amazon site says that the Bosch 15710 will fit your Honda Accord LX. It does not! The connector on the Bosch 15710 has a male connector and the LX and DX Honda Accords require a female connector. The correct Bosch number for the Honda Accord LX and DX is 15712 which I verified at Orielly's Auto Parts store. $38 is an amazing price. Orielly's and Autozone are both $69. I had to return the 15710 and re-order the 15712 for my Honda Accord LX. Hopefully this will save you a return and re-order.
5,Half the price of my local national chain parts store,Nothing else to say really. Amazon had the best price for the exact same part. I was able to buy both for the same price as one locally.
5,Great o2 sensor for low price,"After having check engine code read as o2 sensor neding replacing, bought these. Have not had any issues with these and paid much less than repair shop wanted to charge for them"
4,One of 2 of his best records,"This is either the best or the second best George Howard record there is, depending on who you ask (""Love Will Follow"" being the other). In any event, it's a great smooth jazz record from one of the originators of the form, and wears it's age well. You have to get it for the first 3-4 tracks alone. They're pure smooth jazz, and thet just don't make them as engaging or soulful as Howard did anymore. A must for any smooth jazz head, family bar-b-q or candlelight dinner at home."
3,"Not really thought provoking, but good for some laughs.","This book of absurd situations pitted against each other for selection as your first choice is best reserved for parties involving rolling paper and lava lamps. (Or a case of Bud Light, if that's your preference.)But, hey ... Who am I to judge. I mean, wow, you know what I mean. What were we talking about?Although sure to generate some silly laughs, there is the possability that Would You Rather will generate playing this Q and A game with questions of your own invention that will be more relavent to your own life situation.Good for some very silly fun!"
5,Inside the Pike Place Market,"Braiden Rex-Johnson has written a foodies delight. Sumptuously decorated with the photographs of Paul Soders, Rex-Johnson's exploration of Pike Place Market is candy for all the senses. This is NOT a cookbook. There are just 20 recipes (all very good). Rather, this is a delightful narrative of the history of the market, the people and products that inhabit it, and the terrific food that emerges from it. Braiden-Rex is deeply in love with her market, and it shows in her wonderful book. When you finish the book, you'll be hungry, but very, very satisfied."
5,Fast Backward and Forward Scoop on Our American History,"Want a clear understanding of our American historyin a condensed version?THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE: A SHORT AMERICAN HISTORY [REVISED] Give this a read. Therewas at least one view I disagreed with, but thatdidn't jeopardize my reading the book."
3,Not stories that heal,"I thought this novel would explore the world of depression and how stories such as fairy tales can be used to help the healing process--sort of a Women Who Run with the Wolves meets the modern British novel--but that didn't seem the case to me. The fairy tales, which are the best parts of the novel, don't really bring about many changes in the main character, Benedick Hunter. Finding a copy of his mother's fairy tales, he finds himself curious to know why she commited suicide when he was six. So he starts to search for answers. He continues to read the fairy tales, but after sparking the initial curiosity, they simply become curiosities themselves. The end is resolved in an overly tidy, quick and improbable manner that disappointed me. Read the fairy tales and the rest is easily skipped."

2,"Micheal Green's United States Marshals Service ""YYYeeeaaaH!","Mr. Greens book fails to mention how the Marshals Service is the oldest Federal Law Enforcement Agency which is constantly prodded and kicked by politicians who appoint untrained idiots into federal appointments, who then answer to a management staff who spend millions of dollars to travel around the country doing things that could be done by email, phone, or fax. The Service has at its core great people who are capable of doing even greater things, yet because of the dysfunctional method the 94 districts interface with their headquarters under this administration, one only knows how things couldn't have gotten any worse?"
4,Good Addition to Working the Program,"This book is a good addition when working the steps in a 12 step program. Each step has prayers that are related to it that help you see the step more clearly, give support and help lead you to completion of the steps."
1,misleading book,"Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs. Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that are simply not documented. In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF, for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore not responsible for the terrible consequences. The millions of deaths that resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country. I don't know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible student of Chinese history."
1,No body plays drums anymore,"Soul takes on a new meaning here. As in ,, not much soul. What ever happened to human drummers.If you like soul as in Tower of Power or Cold Blood......forget this album."
3,steady soul CD,This is a good and steady soul album without any spectacular events though (one main hit: sister rosa). James Taylor sings well as always (he's the lead singer of Kool and the Gang) and it's sure a good gem for your soul cd collection
4,Easily Forgettable,"He is good looking, and his music is not bad.However it feels lacking of something to draw myattention longer, and the duration is sort of toolong that every track seems to blend into one pieceto me."
4,"Great CD!! but not awesome like ""The Dance""","There are really great original tracks on this cd. I have been a fan of Dave Koz since college days. But when I think of all of Dave's great albums so far, I believe ""The Dance"" is the most awesome ever. There were so many soulful tracks on that cd that leaves in a state of euphoria that I cannot describe in detail. There were some great tracks on this cd and my favs are I believe and A view from above. Other great artists in this category include Warren Hill, Paul Taylor, Kirk Whalum, and Kenny G."
3,"Good Saxophone, Bad Sounds!!!!!!!","Dave Koz is a very talented musician. Unfortunately, he didn't pull it off with this recording. Too many electronic drum programming. All I See Is You, has potential, but is ruined by all the electronic drums and no bass. You might go for this sort of thing, but not me. I enjoy real instruments."
5,A Smash,"Dave...Soul man in disguise? I definately say so. I love how he fuses all the old music with new styles. British music (Drum N' Bass, underground techno) is a new amazing discovery in my musical catalog, and find it a breath of fresh air when up against something I feel is a comfortably confident artist. I love every track, and its great using a various amount of music, to accentuate one great record. I love his contributions with Chris Botti, and the new sensation, Javier. Buy this ASAP!"
2,Very Below Contemporary Jazz Standards!!!!!!!!!,"As I opened up this cd, I though it might be a cool contemporary jazz package. With the first song, Honey Dipped, I was rather dissapointed, but it wasn't the worst song in the world. I just said, it had its good moments, let me go to the next track. Track after track, nothing got any better. In fact, they were very much worse then, Honey Dipped. Honey Dipped actually sounded good after the next tracks popped into my ears. The rest are just very bad ""new age"" music influenced with, jazz? The synthesizers and electric instruments, dont make it any better. Most of this cd is, an electronic drum beat over some saxophone playing. Bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Turkey softy,"This large bag is wasted for my pet,smelled it and split.It is not like the jerky chewy and hard like beef jerky, i dont know what this things are made of but should name it something else.I went around to the neighborhood and tossed it over to other dogs."
2,"Okay, not the best","I'm a V.C. Andrews fan so I have read most of her books. Of all the books I have read, I like this series the least. Melody comes off as this immature, whiny, childish character who falls apart at the first sign of conflict. Her cousin Cary acts like a whipped dog pining away in his obsession over his dead sister. The storyline is okay, but varies little from V.C. Andrews' other books. I would recommend reading Heaven and the rest of the Casteel series instead, at least the characters in that series are actually likeable."
5,My favorite book of all time,"This has been my favorite book for years now. I've read it at least 10 times and I'm in love with it. The story of Melody sticks with you forever. When I read it I felt like I stepped into her life. I dreamed about the story for months after I finished. Uncle Jacob reminds me so much of my father, quoting the bible all the time and being so protective. I couldn't stand Melody's mom. She was so selfish and I couldn't believe that someone could just go dump a girl off on someone's doorstep and expect them to take care of her. Especially right after the girl lost her father.If you like this book you should definatly read the rest of the series because it's just as amazing."
3,Predictable,"When I start reading VC Andrew's books, I find it difficult to put them down. Her stories make me want to finish the whole book. I must say that her stories are told very interestingly. But I feel that if you read too much of her books at one go, you will feel bored. Melody's story is quite predictable but there is one aspect that I don't quite agree with VC Andrews books. There is usually someone in the family who is bible-spouting. I must say this puts a very bad image on Christianity. Maybe instead of always incest, VC Andrews can add other plots like missing persons, or murders. Usually, VC Andrews books are under horror, so why not put these plots in? At least it will be quite refreshing than the usual mystery of the girl's birth history."
4,The last of Mr. Neiderman's good work,"While Melody wasn't as good as the Casteel, Cutler, and Dollanganger series, it was still a good read, and a decent series. Melody has a lot of enemies, and secrets to contend with, but she shows to be a fine young lady with a good backbone, and was overall a good heroine in face of what she had to deal with.This is the last series that Mr. Neiderman, the ghostwriter for VCA, put any real effort into. If you're interested in reading V.C. Andrews, only buy the Logan series or any of the series that came before it."
2,"Incest, again, and again, and again...dull.","having just finished Melody I feel that I ought to reflect on it. Melody is another carbon copy of the Dollanganger series, Melody's beloved father dies in the first chapter and then the mother becomes terribly selfish and leaves Melody with relatives, whilst staying with her new found family, melody discovers that the family is riddled with the ubiquitous incest and the story follows on with this particulaly poor storyline. Even though I say all this, I thoroughly intend to read Heart Song and any future publications due to my commitment to the memory of the late V.C Andrews, but I sincerely hope that the ghost writing improves......."
5,One of the best books I have every read!!!,Ms. Andrews had to be the most creative writer I have ever read. She had a way of putting you in the characters place. Melody was a very sweet girl with a very shady past. With her hard life we could only imagine what she went through. But you also felt if you where right ther going through it with her. I have enjoyed many VC Andrews books and I will continue to read them.
3,"You Only Live Once: The Non-Barry Bonds, Michael Kamen","John Barry was originally scheduled to do the music for ""Licence to Kill"" (1989), but illness prevented him from this task. Instead, the eleventh hour assignment fell to Michale Kamen, who had produced a number of action scores of his own. The title was performed by Gladys Knight, and reminds one a bit of ""Goldfinger"" which is not surprising given the credits: Narada Michael Walden, Jeffrey Cohen, Walter ""Baby Love"" Afanasieff, John Barry and Anthony Newley. Despite being a song by committee, it works fairly well. The score, by Kamen, is a worthy effort. It certainly works to accentuate particular scenes in the film, and does have its moments. A love theme, the music for part of the pre-title sequence, and the climax are all notable. Still, taken as a whole, it is clear that this soundtrack was not what was originally hoped for."
3,Licence to kill - not thrill,"Not one of the better Bond soundtracks, but brings back great memories of the movie when you listen to it."
3,ONE OF THE BEST JAMES BOND THEMES,"...but all other tracks are spoof. Though I don't like the title song, I think the end-titles ""If you aked me to"" are one of the best love songs ever. So get it as a single better."
5,James Bond is out on his own...and out for revenge!,"The music of Licence to Kill is done by Michael Kamen. Gladys Knight performs the powerful title song with a magnificent voice and quality. This title song is the longest in the series running at about 5 minutes. Another stunning song is the end title song If You Asked Me To by Patti Labelle. A strong song that gives the listener a real sense of sensational quality. Tim Feehan provides the pop-rock song Dirty Love which can be heard during the bar sequence of the movie. The final song on the soundtrack Licence Revoked is a slam-bang tune that includes Michael Kamen's own rendition of the James Bond theme. A very nice soundtrack, that only comes a little short on the amount of tracks. Very Nice!"
1,Magnavox tv/dvd -,"Have had the 13"" tv/dvd for 2 years. We use it only a few weekends a month, and have had no trouble with it during all this time. 2 weeks ago,however, the dvd player kept ejecting the dvd.Called magnavox customer service,serv reps very hard to understand and they couldn't understand me.20 minutes of repeating info and then the rep said that he had never heard of such a problem, this problem has never come up before in his experience. After reading several reviews on different websites about this model, apparently he was very mistaken. They would not accept tv back even with us paying for servicing.Website customer service ""is not working at this time"" for 2 weeks now. Will not buy Magnavox product again.Customer service was the worst of it."
2,"Nice Picture, Broken DVD Player","We had this relatively inexpensive TV for about 5 weeks when the DVD player ceased to function properly. It is still under warranty so we're going to send it in, but we are paying for shipping to Arkansas which is not going to be cheap. Hopefully this will be the end of our support issues.Aside from that the picture has been good. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Horrible Product, Horrible Service",Like the others who have purchased this awful piece of equipment I experienced the DVD player stopped working at about the 30 day mark. I returned the TV and Philips replaced it with a new one. It's been 5 months and the DVD player still works but now the TV operation is not functioning properly. When I contacted the Philips customer service line I was told that since it is beyond 3 months I'm out of luck. I guess I can use it as a fancy paper weight..................
1,DVD Player,"The DVD player on the model I bought (32 inch) was faulty from the start. Took in the disk my son picked out ""special"" when we bought the t.v. and will neither play it nor eject it. Customer service gave me the number of an authorized service center 30 minutes from me. It's hard to believe that yesterday I didn't have a television and today I've got one that needs servicing. If you are in the market for expensive hassles (with a bonus of disappointed youngsters), then by all means, rush out and GET THIS T.V.!"
5,"Get ""Hooked"" on the Simpsons","I feel I have known Bill from our conversations on the web and thru our transactions on E bay. Bill is the Jedi-master when it comes to the Simpsons and you can find out all you ever wanted to know about Simpson merchandise, past and present, just by reading this book...Make sure you visit his web site too, for more updates on the ever growing Simpsons collectables of the world. Thanks for the book, Bill and hope to see you at the convention in 2000."
5,Can't live without,"I don't know how I ever did without these. I lift weights and do a lot of pre-workout cardio. From the eliiptacle to the track they are great, and they are unmatched when I'm working with free weights and don't want to get tangled. My ONLY issue has been breaking my rediculous dependence on iTunes and getting music transferred to Media Player (and then the sportphones). After loading a few favorites onto disc it was easy enough, and I have been using these six days a week since I got them (about a month ago). Highly recommend!"
3,somewhere over china,somewhere over china is a lot better then rated by the last person who rated it. The title song is a classic. There is Jimmy and there is Jimmy. The modern Jimmy is nowhere near as good as the old classics. Somewhere over china is worth a listen
2,Do you really want to be Julia Childs?,"In a moment of passion -- having just purchaed a Weber Gold Grill -- I ordered this cookbook. However, I realized after looking at it for a week or so that I don't really want to spend two or three hours preparing ingredients just to cook some bloody good steak, or lamb, or (well cooked) chicken.You'd be better off with either of the Weber Grill cookbooks, which I also ordered and think are very fine."
2,Disappointed,"A very technical book with a complete lack of example programs. Has lots of in-depth and technical information, but fails to expand on this with some real life training programs. Handy to have to look up some scientific information, but not one I would recommend to anyone but those doing a sports science degree."
3,Adequate attempt at introducing modeling,"The stated goal of this book is to introduce the science of chemical modeling to newcomers. It assumes the reader has little knowledge of crystallography, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or computer programming; the four fields upon which chemical modeling is built upon. As such, the book does an adequate job. The math is adequate and well-documented. There is even coverage of the numerous techniques used in chemical modeling. And there are relevant examples of how modeling is applied.The book could be written better though. The text is written in first-person, and would flow better written in third-person. The figures and tables/charts are good. There are adequate references to other sources that expand upon what is covered in the text. All in all, this is a good text to use in undergraduate chemistry / materials science courses to introduce students to atomistic scale modeling."
5,best yoga pants,"Be Present yoga pants are by far the very best yoga pants. Comfortable and truly provide best ""agility"". Highly recommended!"
4,"You're normal, the artist's statement was written by someone on drugs","The next time you go to a gallery or museum to see a photography exhibit and can't make heads or tails of the artist's statement or the curator's description about the work (and you also speak the same language that it is written in) then read this book to feel better. Occam's Razor is a serious and well written critique of certain aspects of the world of Fine Art Photography, certain types of academic programs in photography and other related areas. An unusually entertaining and fairly quick read for a book on a subject like this."
5,FROM BACK COVER,"""Life and Death in dreadful conflict stove...""It happened long ago and far away - perhaps in another close by. Two war-maddened races fought to the death, and though they both are gone, their legacy abides: the terrible weapons they unleashed on each other and could not control - the berserkers. Robots programmed for one purpose only: to seek out and destroy all life. The death machines have harried their way across our galaxy. Now they have come for us.Here is the essence of the Berserker Saga in a single volume:THE BERSERKER WARS"
1,"If you're looking for ""hands-on"" knowledge, forget this one","This book was organized well, and it does a good job explaining many of the theoretical details of the Universal Serial Bus. It looks as if it were written to sell the reader on the virtues of the USB and the many reasons why he or she should buy more peripherals to connect to the computer through this interface. I was disappointed, however, because I was looking for some ""hands-on"" examples of how to implement some practical, functioning peripheral. The book includes a CD ROM in the back, but there wasn't any executable code there to allow a user to send data to a USB peripheral. There are a lot of directories full of Acrobat .pdf files and photos about non-USB subjects, and some empty directories, also. All in all, I'm sorry I bought it!"
2,you'll like it if you are in 7th grade,"i read this book in two hours, and i was NOT at all impressed. the quality of writing was very, very poor. i have seen high-school kids write better. what did i come with after reading this book? that i just WASTED my money. it seems that the only reason somebody would read it, would be because they enjoy the punk references, which can be slightly interesting. i wouldn't read this book again... if you are interested in a simple read, go for it... but to me, this was just plain boring. i would reccomend SALAD DAYS over this tenfold. also, MY WORLD by jeff ott is a bit more insightful than this."
5,SPEAK is the best Roches album,"Don't listen to the rumors that ""Speak"" is the worst Roches album, because in all honesty, it is the BEST Roches album. This album totally totally changed my life and it continues to inspire me every time I listen to it. The cheesy synth arrangements that adorn the tracks only add to the brilliance of this album in my opinion. I might also add that this album contains my very favorite song of all time not just by the Roches, but by ANY RECORDING ARTIST EVER, which is the song ""Merciful God."" That song is the work of true geniuses, as are many, many more of songs on this timeless masterpiece. Don't pass it up!!!"
3,cookware,"Nice pans, but after putting a frying pan in the dishwasher, the outer coating started peeling. It's stated they are dishwasher safe."
3,Its good,"It works great with my Jabra BT620s, however it falls out of the iPod to easily. Other than that, it works just fine."
3,jabra bluetooth music adapter for ipod,Product is a good product wth one major hitch. . .it comes off too easily from the ipod.
1,Could not connect to iPod,"I bought this Bluetooth Music adapter for iPod to connect to S9 headphones. I have several Bluetooth items that work well. I could not get this device to connect to my headphones. After multiple attempts, I will have to make a return and try another item. The headphones connect great to my Droid phone. I don't like the fact that Amazon will only give a partial return for this item. It was a Christmas present that didn't work."
1,worked great for about 2 months,"I am also a user of the Oticon EPOQ hearing aids. This product was GREAT for letting me listen to my ipod. But. After about a month of use, it did become very loose and would decouple from the ipod very easily. And now, after about 2 months of using it, it seems to have stopped working completely. It pairs and connects to my streamer, but no sound comes through. It's too bad, really, because it was shaping up to be a really nice solution. Looks like I'm back to a wired connection until I find something better."
5,Great Bag!,"I totally love this bag. It is sturdy, attractive and has good pockets and best of all I got it for the same price as lesser quality bags that were being sold in the pro shops where I bowl. Worth the wait to shop online."
1,Poncin' in the Hood,"Yet another panegyric to the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name. Ugh. Can't these rappers find something else to endlessly extol other than their fetishistic penchant for rootering their fellow man? There's a whole world of sensual delights out there, and some of them just might involve the opposite sex, you know, and orifices other than the excretory one (and one of them is actually designed for the purpose of carnal congress).Sorry if that's too boring for these blustering sodomites, but I'm tired of hearing about the glories of glory holing from these posturing pansies. Why don't they try going straight, for once?"
1,Cheap plastic junk,"You get what you pay for, which in this case is cheap, flimsy plastic that can't even hold the weight of a few pounds of bird seed.Three weeks after I purchased it, the plastic tube split down the side as I was refilling it.Don't waste your money like I did."
3,Not great for small seeds,"I don't know if the birds in my backyard are particularly messy eaters, but more of the millet seed from this feeder ends up on the ground than anywhere else! You can see the showers of seed falling down as the birds peck at the feeder. I originally bought this feeder because it was inexpensive, but what money I saved has since been spent on replacement bird seed. I'll still use the feeder, but I think I'll have to fill it with a chunkier feed such as sunflower seeds."
1,Broke the next day.,"Garden Song 480-12 Classic Bird FeederThe price on this product is what made me buy it. The problem is that it's very cheaply made and I found mine,the next day on the patio floor, broken and I was left with a big mess from the bird seeds. I guess it's not supposed to have so many seeds or so many openings for the birds to feed from to withstand the weight. Overall, I am very dissapointed and I do not recommend it. Look for something sturdier if you want it to last."
3,one good one busted,"Ordered two of these units and recieved both of them in one box, one in perfect condition, one that had all of the feeding ports seperated from the feeder, and all proken beyond use. Have to return that one for replacement and as one would expect, I am a bit resentful of the hassle."
3,Moo? Moo who? The cow?,"This book is about this boy named Moo who witnessed a car crash. This car crash also led to a murder. Moo is one of those boys who always get made fun of because he is fat, and never gats any attention at all. Everyone who knows about the crash and murder (including the bad guys) want Moo to talk to them and tell them every single detail that he saw. Moo won't do that; he likes all the attention that he can get, whether it is negative or positive. The guy who is getting charged with the murder hired some professionals to try to get Moo to change his statement about him. You will have to read the book to see if the bad guys can get Moo to change his mind about his statement.I didn't like this book because I thought that it didn't take off, and get interesting fast enough. I don't have a good enough attention span for these types of books.I would recommend this book to readers who like all types of books, and don't judge a book by its cover."
2,What???,This book was kinda boring. it about a 15 years old boy who gets bullied because of his weight. The narrator 'Moo' repeats himself alot and talks to himself alot to so it was confusing. I was expecting to read alot of interesting things in the end about the court case but it ends in the middle of Moo making desicions and in a terrible crisis.
3,CONFUSING BOOK,"This is a book about a kid named Moo who is bullied and picked on and one day he goes to his ""special spot"" and witnesses a road rage where someone is murdered. He ends up going to court but is blackmailed by the lawyers before he gets there. You eventually figure out which side he testifies for, and at the very end you find out what ""kiss the rain"" actually means. This is a descent book but it's hard to understand. Moo repeats himself over and over and he also does a lot of talking to himself which makes the book confusing. I wouldn't advise anyone lower than tenth grade to read this book."
1,CRAP,"This is what i sent the BoxWave company""i ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON THE 3RD OF FEBRUARY AND RECIEVED IT ON THE 6TH TODAY IS THE 12TH OF FEBRUARY AND WHEN I WENT TO CLOSE UP MY IPAD IN TO THE BOXWAVE CASE /KEYBOARD THE KEYBOARD FELL OUT OF THE ALUMINUM BOTTOM AND AS THE KEYBOARD HIT THE FLOOR THE CONNECT BUTTON AND THE POWER SWICH FELL OUT AND WERE LOST i BELEIVE THAT YOUR PRODUCT IS CRAP!!! AND I AM VERY SORRY THAT I BOUGHT IT. i WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REFUND OF MY 25.00 DOLLARS SO I CAN BUY SOMETHING THAT IS USEFULL. YES I AM PISSED"
3,"Spoiled, once you know it's fake","I had bootleg MP3's of these songs several years ago, and was thankful to finally find the CD. But, the illusion is somewhat spoiled once you know that the enigmatic Mr. Pontiac is a complete fiction, and his colorful life never happened. The hoax has been propped up with fake bio websites, and even fake Amazon reviews claiming that ""grandpappy had his 78's"" and people claiming to see him perform in the 1960's. Sorry, everyone, but this album was recorded by John Lurie in the late 1990's. The music is still good."
1,The worst and Hokie-est Dave Carradine military pick of alltime!,"Even Kill Zone, with Tony Dorsett(!) and Americanaare better! And that's saying something. If youwant David Carradine at his best, see Night Rythyms,Deadly Survellience or Kung Fu!"
4,Surprisingly useful at home.,We've had our children lose/dump out/ waste countless tiny bottles of this and using the dispenser and refills has put an end to that. They use it more often than they would wash their hands - is that really something to complain about?I'm tempted to try to put one in the mini-van too.
1,Flotek whole house filtration system is seriously flawed,"I have experienced the same problems as the first reviewer with the Flotek whole house water filter. You may be able to loosen the housing and change the filter yourself once or twice, but beyond that - forget it! No matter how carefully you tighten the unit when you a replace a filter, it inevitably binds up and your only alternative becomes calling a plumber who will, ultimately, have to replace, or bypass, the unit. Flotek's customer servioce is of no practical use to customers at all once the housing unit has bound up and you can't replace a filter - I suspect becasue they know the unit is flawed, that it will bind up making filter replacement impossible, and, there is little or nothing anyone can do exept replace the entire unit - housing and all!!! Yet, they continue selling it to unsuspecting homeownwers."
5,good book,the book is in quite good condition and i bought it at a really cheap price.it's useful and easy to understand.
3,Sound quality,"First off, I love Sonny - old Sonny, Bridge Sonny, 80's and 90's Sonny. I was very excited to get this recording, because I have treasured many of his live recordings through the years.However, when I put it on, I was surprised to hear that it sounds like an audience recording, rather than a soundboard. The musicians are somewhat distant, and the applause is prominent. Admittedly, it sounds like a very good audience recording, but there are plenty of those in circulation.I am enjoying it, but would have preferred a recording with better sound."
2,Overproduced,"I have been a big Nanci Griffith fan for years and believe she is at her best with simple arrangements featuring her beautiful voice,guitar and minimal accompaniment. The electronic background noise in most of this collection is overpowering, particularly the pounding drumbeats."
5,Pre req Neil Diamond 101,This a good compilation of ND's classics. He is a wonderful song writer with songs that brings me back to that special place in my mind/heart of the '70's'.
4,It makes me happy,"No greatest hits collection will ever make everyone happy. Yes, it's missing Kentucky Woman and Cherry, Cherry, although the latter probably isn't that big of an oversight. It was put together before Longfellow Serenade and Beautiful Noise, but the songs on here allow me to lose myself in Diamond's rich voice--before the real schlocky stuff like You Don't Bring me Flowers (I can do without that one for the rest of my life). And this reminds me of why I fell in love with Brooklyn Roads. Not a perfect collection by any means, but I still revel in it. I have two other of his Greatest HIts collections, but this is the one I keep going back to."
2,leaks like a sieve...,"I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but unless I tighten this mug with a plumber's PIPE WRENCH, it leaks all down the front of my shirt EVERY TIME!!I found the insulation adequate...but then again I drink my coffee FAST, so it doesn't have the chance to get cold.Also, the base is too narrow for anything but cup holder usage...try using it on your desk and you're in for a sure spill if you so much as TAP the mug while it's full..."
3,Decent product,"I needed a travel mug that didn't spill after buying a Bubba mug (do not buy). I feel the 16 oz drive-time travel mug is ok is you really want a mug that doesn't spill which is why I purchased mine. I did however feel it was a little pricey at almost 20 bucks! Granted, it is stainless steel both inside and out, but I feel it may have been a little more than I origionally expected to pay. I am a firm believer of getting what you pay for but feel this could have been a bit cheaper. The design is very sleek and allows both left and right handers to utilyze this mug with ease as you can drink from anywhere on the lid. Overall, if you want a good travel mug that will not spill and need no more than about 18 ounces of your favorite beverage at a time, the Trudeau mug is a good buy."
1,"Sorry I bought it, doesn't work","It doesn't leak when closed, but it's ""open"" setting only allows for a few drops to come out of the mug. This makes it a TERRIBLE mug for driving or traveling, because you have to more or less invert the thing for minutes at a time in hopes of getting a few drops of lukewarm coffee. (Oh yeah, it's not so good at keeping it hot.) This would be good for gerbils, maybe, but not for people who need their caffeine at a slightly higher rate in the morning. I'll probably throw this away. What a waste!"
3,Tips over easily,"As you can tell from the picture the Trudeau travel mug is more narrow on the lower portion of the container than the upper portion. You might think this would make it prone to tip over easily... and you'd be correct in your thinking. This particular design causes the mug to be very unstable in my truck's cup holder. On the way to work it almost always winds up on the floor. Also, if it is bumped while sitting on a table it seems to more easily tip over than cups with a wider base.The Trudeau Travel Mug's screw on lid does seal well and it keeps coffee hot for about an hour.I would not buy another one with this particular shape."
2,"If I had to pick one Indian cookbook, I'd pick another","I bought this book along with ""Indian Home Cooking: A Fresh Introduction to Indian Food, with More Than 150 Recipes"" by Suvir Saran and Stephanie Lyness and every time go with the latter when I want to make a dish. If I had to pick one book this one would not be it."
2,This book is missing a lot,"I really enjoy Indian food, and was looking for a cookbook that would allow me to fix my favorites at home. I am disappointed.Most of the dishes I order when eating out (Rogan Josh, Lamb Korma, Gulab Jaman, etc.) are not in this book.I will continue looking."
3,Could have used more Paul,"Given that the Apostle Paul wrote the earliest Christian documents we still possess, it has always surprised me that so many ""historical Jesus"" books focus on the Gospels. Paul would seem the proper place to start ""the quest,"" and so he is.Strange then that the author devotes the first half of his book about Paul to - you guessed it - the Gospels. Still, the author must be commended for the great sobriety with which he approaches the gospel texts. Sadly, the second half of the book, where he focuses on Paul, isn't nearly as good.I enjoyed the book and recommend it, but if you have time for only one tome on this subject then you really should read ""The Jesus Puzzle"" by Earl Doherty. In fact, the Doherty book is so important you should read it even if you don't have time."
2,A book you'll want to forget...,"I found the book's premise (and introductory chapters) to be somewhat intriguing. However, the plot became more implausible with each chapter until it lost its integrity altogether. What could have been an interesting novel turned out to be a far-fetched tale that left me shaking my head in confusion and disappointment."
2,"The Stepford Wives - Updated, But Not a New Premise","What a disappointment! I was intrigued, initially, until I got about 25 pages into this book and discovered it was ""The Stepford Wives"" with a twist. Since there was nothing much original, although well written enough, I rated this two stars. Had it been poorly written, it would have rated zero for lack of originality and, essentially, copying Ira Levin's premise with the twist that the men are the puppets and the women the masters. I did finish the book, but wouldn't waste the money purchasing it for anything more than 25 cents at a flea market."
4,Unfortunately not as good as the first one,"I really loved the characters and ideas presented in the first book. The second is still a good book with lots of interesting ideas, but mostly uninteresting characters."
2,Missing pieces,Not a bad puzzle. It took us a few hours. Only problem is we were missing 3 pieces which I find very irrating.
3,Good Puzzle,"This is a fun puzzle and is not too hard and not too easy. The picture on the box could be a little better, the full picture of the complete puzzle is on the side of the lid so it is a little small and the picture on the top of the lid cuts the edges off of the puzzle."
5,What you expected,This cd is what you'd expect from Hawthorne Heights but with some other melodies and harder guitar riffs in it. The lyrics aren't quite as clear and catchy as the last cd but altogether its a great cd
5,My second favorite,"Although I like her new ""Translated From Love"" the best, this and her other early ones are still on my favorites list, and this seems to always rest at the top of those. Along with the other favorite tracks mentioned, I'd also have to include ""River of Love,"" which she still includes in her concerts, to the delight of all of us lucky enough to be there."
4,The First Kelly Willis Album,"I first bought this album on Cassette in 1990 (?) and I remember wearing it out to the point where the first and last songs ""dragged"" when played. Then I upgraded to CD, and I still have that one today. For a First Album, Kelly Willis did quite well....Maybe not so on the charts, but she made her mark and the album seemed to show promise for things to come. At the time, she had a completely new sound, when compared to her peers of Kathy Mattea or Pam Tillis, but after 2 more progressively better albums, she left the scene...only to return nowadays with a tired/lifeless sound. If you can still get this CD, do so. There are 3 ""stand-out"" tracks: ""Red Sunset"", ""My Heart's in Trouble Tonight"", and ""I dont Want To Love You (But I do)"". There's also her cover of ""Drive South"", which, in my opinion was a fine effort but not quite up to Suzy Boguss' standards."
4,Great fit and easy to install,"SInce they are the same as what comes on the 817663 mask, they fit perfectly. Easy to install. I would give it a perfect score but I have no way to actually test the product in a laboratory as to if they filter as well as they say they do. I can say that I was spraying all day with a pesticide and never smelled any come through into the mask."
3,Not advanced enough...,"This is very good beginning book. However, if you're actually in the business world, trying to position your product, this book is not for you! It's too broad and should look for a positioning book that is aligned with your industry."
4,A great read for positioning any product,"I would highly recommend this book, and I have recommended it to several people I have come into contact with who are looking to explore marketing options. It is an easy read that contains valuable information for a day-to-day career. If you have not spent time reading this book, I would highly recommend it for the content and theory not only the entertainment received from it. I will keep this book and refer back to topics that would aid me in marketing the business in which I am associated with and marketing myself. It has also encouraged me to continue reading books associated with other related business books."
4,A Must Read book,"After finishing my marketing diploma I decided to dig deeper about all concepts I've learned. One of these concepts was ""Positioning"" and the best title you will ever find for this concept is this book. If you are working in marketing communications field this book is a MUST read for you. If you are an entrepreneur who is after a quick marketing advice this book isn't for you, As you will not find actionable advices which you can apply in your business.For me it was a great read and it has enriched my marketing knowledge except some contradictions authors did fall in which made me pretty distorted about when should I use this concept and when shouldn't I do."
5,Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind,"Just as with the authors' other books, this is an excellent source of marketing information for the novice as well as the experienced business person."
4,Excellent Read,"Enjoyed this book a lot, lots of terrific ideas on ways to position and to grow your business"
3,funny even to a non-CS,"This isn't one of Twain's best books, but it is a pretty hilarious send-up of Christian Science nonetheless. I think it is funnier if you know a little bit about the religion, but it probably doesn't seem as funny to people who actually practice the religion.A CS friend told me that CSs are fond of quoting passages from Twain that ""prove"" he became a fan of Eddy in later life. The quote they cite as proof is typical of the sarcasm in this book: ""Mother Eddy deserves a place in the Trinity as much as any member of it. She has organized and made available a healing principle that for two thousand years has never been employed except as the merest kind of guesswork. She is the benefactor of the age.""If the above quote strikes you as funny, buy this book. If you believe the quote is serious, I'd advise you to give it a miss."
2,Not one of Twain's best,"Twain enjoyed skewering odd-ball reigions, especially ones he thought had a chance of causing great mischief, witness his appendix toRoughing It (Mark Twain Library), in which he preserved for all time the Mormons' disgraceful slaughter of innocent settlers (the ""Mountain Meadow Massacre"") and this book. The first is great writing, but this suffers from Twain's use of endless repetition to make a point.A better book on Christian Science isThe Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science, a thorough debunking of Christian Science and Mary Baker Eddy. Highly recommended."
1,"Twain issued retraction, too","This is interesting. I've come across this book in the local library, and it seems that he later printed a serious, public retraction of what he wrote. He excused what he had written due to his having had an insufficient understanding of the subject and the basis of its terminology. Everything was grist for his mill, especially such a popular topic of those times, but obviously something happened in his life to occasion this retraction. I agree that most of the posts here show a strong personal bias for or against the subject. All very interesting.Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (Authorized Edition)"
4,Sponge Bob Sheets...a little large,"The sheets are slightly large for the full mattress (but they will stay the mattress), but have held well under fire from a 6 year old! He enjoys the sheets and they have held their color well! Overall a great buy."
1,"Micro, not mini!","I ordered these pans from anothe online vendor, but am returning them because they are TINY. I expected to be able to divide a regular quick bread recipe into the four pans, but these are far too small for that."
5,Finally!!,"For a few years now, Lori Foster has given us glimpses of the mysterious mountain man named Jamie Creed. Now the wait is finally over and it is more then worth the wait. Jamie has a secret about why he has lived for so long in the mountains, with only a few people he can call friends, but his past may be revealed when Faith comes to town.Faith knows everything that happened to Jamie and why he is living the hermit lifestyle, but she needs his help. It doesn't hurt that Jamie is hotter and sexier then any man should either.Jamie is well worth the wait and as and added bonus we get Alyx and Scott's story too. Run, do not walk to the store and get this really awesome book. :)"
3,"Good recipes, but close-minded attitude","I highly recommend this book for the recipes, but I was very turned off by the ""open grill only"" attitude of the authors. The authors believe in charcoal or other open flame methods only, and thumb their nose at Weber-style grills which employ the cover of the grill in cooking.This in itself was not terrible, but the authors made a feeble, almost cynical attempt at ""also providing"" covered cooking methods and times, and it appears as if they went off of a chart as opposed to actually doing it for themselves. The times are generally completely out of whack with what my grill actually required (I use a Weber Silver B, which is not the most powerful grill out there but is certainly more than adequate for any of the recipes I tried). Some of the instructions are incomplete or downright contradictory!So, recommended for charcoal users; everyone else, beware."
5,Magic Carpet Ride lasts forever,"CD is great, songs are just like I remember. Have this one in my vinyl LP-Album collection, but now that my turntable is obsolete and not in working order, hadn't had any opportunity to listen to any of my stock from the old days. Great to rekindle the music of this rocking band."
1,Problem with Windows XP,"I bought it as an upgrade over McAfee 2006. It took over my computer, and slowed down the computer substantially. It has too many features connected in a complicated way that will affect the performance of your computer. Don't buy this if you use windows xp."
1,Tv Broke in 2 months,"Bought the TV about 2 months ago, Picture is great everything worked, Sound quality is pretty crappy, the internal speakers are about as good as my laptops.But after about 70 days, the TV just shut off and wouldnt turn on again. Quite a waste of money, and even if you are covered in the warranty they take about 4 months to do anything about it."
2,Too formulaic for a usually good author.,"Realizing that Lewis's books can often be preachy, they are still mostly enjoyable with well-drawn characters and good plots. This one is sub-par for Lewis, however. The plot is contrived and the preaching comes very heavy-handed. I found the Christianity to be inserted in odd ways and conversions less than believable. I usually love Lewis's work and her Amish characters in particular, but this one was definitely not her best work. Perhaps it was the influence of her husband? I'm glad I've got the newest in the Abram's Daughters series to look forward to or I'm afraid my interest in Lewis would end with this one."
5,Barron's Is Right: Top Book of 2002,"I read Cunningham's book based on the review in Barron's rounding up the best investment books of 2002. They were right. The book is a eye-opening intro to the psychology of investing, important to investors and market observers/regulators. (Cunningham's other books have more of the basics for investors--also very good books.)"
3,Losing Faith,"Although Neiderman is one of my favorite authors in the genre, he is losing his talent. This idea of this book seems to be a recycled, but different writing of The Immortals, which is one of my favorite novels by this author (or any novel, for that matter). I'm sorry to say this, but maybe Neiderman needs to sit back awhile and reflect before writing another novel with a storyline that's been either recycled or done before."
5,Bring it Back!,"Well, I'm not going to boo-hoo about the lack of DVD quality or the mono sound or whatever. I'll talk about the movie itself. The only thing that compares to it is Star Wars itself, which admittedly opened the way for Galactica to be put on the air, updated from a 1960s Glen Larson script called Adam's Ark (Adam...Adama...get it?).Galactica in many ways surpasses Star Wars and certainly surpasses Return of the Jedi. It should be brought back as either a movie or a series, which I hear the Sci-Fi Channel is considering a possibility. Hopefully the powers that be will check the reviews here at Amazon. There are nearly 50 reviews here for this twenty-year-old ""failed"" series! This should have been dead and forgotten about by 1983. But it isn't. There is money to be made here, powers that be! Isn't that incentive enough for you? See it dangling right there in front of you? Go on, reach out for it. Take it. Mmmm...money, money, money."
1,"A great movie for the day, but the sound quality...","Previous reviewers have said most of what is great about this DVD and the series in general. The Battlestar Galactica film, and the pilot version, were great for their day, at turns dark, and bright. And honestly about half the television episodes were just as great as well, with intermittent episodes of fair to mediocre quality.SO IF I LIKE THIS SO MUCH... Why the one star only? The sound! In this day and age to buy a DVD, even from the late 70's / early 80s, that is in such a price range, and it only has 1.0 sound. That is simply not acceptable at all. Essentially one is getting a DVD with only VHS sound quality, and then the price you pay is supposedly justified only by the widescreen picture format."
5,christian view of battlestar,this movie is a prime example of the age old fight between the forces of good and evil.Much as we face in our lives every day just wish it would have made referance to God instead of the lords of cobal
3,Strictly for Fleming lovers!,"AsI write this, there are 17 reviews for the Byschoff /Fleming version and 8 for the Bohm/Hilde Gueden/James King version. This is because Fleming lovers will follow her to the end, remembering her stellar roles in other operas. I believe the magic of the this lyrical opera is lost with Fleming, although her voice is strong. The conducting is certainly poorer than Bohm's in bringing out the rich lyrical quality of the opera, particularly as the opera approaches its culmination and the laurel tree sings of the earth's sap flowing up the roots. In the 17 reviews there is little mention of the orchestration and in that lies the art of Strauss. Certainly one would have to hear the Fleming opera several times to get to its interpretation. Not so for the Bohm."
2,Imagine my Surprise,"I purchased this product to replace one that my contractor got from the local big box store, believing that it was a better designed product.It was installed last November and it was perfect until this spring when I noticed the screen lying on the ground underneath the vent. How disappointing and annoying, especially since the vent hood fan has been turned on less than ten times during that period!!The rating is for the inconvenience of having to pull out a ladder and reinstalling the screen that should have stayed on in the first place."
3,"2 ""hard to find"" pop gems--","We've all heard the terrific pop classics GAME OF LOVE and GROOVY KIND OF LOVE (which are included on this CD). However the real treasure on this CD are the two songs The Mindbenders performed in the film, ""To Sir With Love"" (OFF AND RUNNING; and IT'S GETTING HARDER ALL THE TIME).2 POP GEMS!"
5,Perfect gift,"This is a perfect gift - my kids received this last Christmas, they were 3 & 4 at the time. They still use it to this day. We gave these as gifts to my 2 yr-old nephew and 4 yr-old neighbor. I love to give gifts that are durable and the kids are still interested in a year later. These are so easy to clean up (the kids do it and they know they have to count to 32 before they have all the pieces)."
5,"smart,simple safe and enduring","I bought a set of these for my grandson age 7,two years ago because someone raved about what a hit these were with a wide range of kids. I was underwhelmed and a little concerned about the cost when I saw the box. They are sneaky addictive and we bought an additional set this year because he has played with them consistently. They have proved very durable in both construction and appeal.You have to love a simple idea that sparks imaginative play for over 2 years with no bells, flashing lights or computer chips. If you are looking for a toy made in the usa this is a hit."
5,Endless hours of fun!,"These tiles are so much fun! We got them last christmas, and my two 6 year olds still drag them out to play. At first they were really creative with building new things, now it seems like its mostly space ships and barns for their Lego and Playmobil characters to hide out in.The toys seem to be very durable. They get tossed around and banged up to one another and have not had a single problem with them cracking or anything. I wish the magnets were a tad bit stronger, but it works. I also wish there were more pieces, its difficult to build a whole ton of things with these. But overall, we love these tiles! The colors are pleasant, they look like pretty stained glass when held up in the light. Very good construction, and a very fun toy to own!"
