5,This is from my teen years the era I lived in,"I am very nostalgic, and preserving my memories, I watched this movie 6 times at the theater. So I received it in good condition and love it then and now"
3,"Good read, but there are some MAJOR probelms","I am almost embarassed to admit that I enjoyed reading this book. It's a good plot, keeps you interested, but it has some BIG problems. Tami sends a very dangerous message with the relationship that she presents between Marilee and JD. Throughout the entire beginning of the book, JD does things that could definitely be defined as sexual harassment, and Marilee just becomes increasingly attracted to him. The trashy romance feeling is prevalent, and that's ok, but it makes me nervous that Hoag implies that women want to be treated the way JD treats Marilee. And even if Mari shows indignation towards him at times, she does end up sleeping with him. This is not the kind of reward he should get for his chauvinistic and sometimes sadistic behavior. Tami, don't perpetuate those age old stereotypes about women-that when they say no, they really mean yes. I don't think I would read any of her other books after this one."
3,Not my favorite,Slow in the beginning but picked up towards the end. Good but not one of her best. Too much romance for my taste.
5,Murder Mystery and Hot Romance all in One,"If you are a past reader of romance stories you will love this one. This is a very intriguing murder mystery with a few hot love scenes thrown in for an added touch.Marilee is about to change her life forever she leaves all behind in California and moves to Montana to visit a girlfriend who will let her hang out to recoup. I love the comment ""it started out as a bad hair day and then went downhill"" most of us have had that feeling at one time or another.She arrives to find that her friend is dead, though the case is supposed to be open/shut accident Marilee isn't buying it.There is a lot of interesting information and side characters that are developed in this book. I particularly like the interaction between the locals and the ""celebrities"" and how they clash. I can see this completely in my mind!If you want a good book pick this one up in either audio or paperback!"
2,Too much romance and sex,"I loved Tami Hoag's Ashes to Ashes and a Thin Dark Line, but this book was nothing like those two. This one is all about sex and romance with a tiny bit of murder. I read this book just so I could finish it, now I can get onto reading better mystery/crime novels. If you like crime, suspense and mystery (Cornwell, Reichs, Hoag after 1997) then give this a big MISS!"
1,"Murder mystrey, I don't think so.",This was my first time of reading a Tami Hoag book and I was extremly disappointed. She spent more time talking about JD and Marliee's sexual attraction to one another than actually getting to the point (which was why was Lucy killed and who killed her?). Once in awhile I actually thought YES! this is getting better but then this feeling never seemed to last. The reason for Lucy's death I felt was so lame - I was expecting something sinster but as usal I was let down. In short I found the book extremly boring when compared to other crime/mystrey novels I have read. It was more of a romantic novel than murder mystrey. I will definetly not be reading anymore of her books.
2,This is a romance novel with a little suspense,"After reading several great Tami Hoag thrillers (Night Sins, Guilty as Sin, Ashes to Ashes, Thin Red Line) I was very disappointed with this book. This is no competitor to Stephen King novels. This is strictly romance. Tami Hoag is great at thrillers but should leave the romance to Nora Roberts."
1,not worth the money,This book would have been good had the author not inserted the raunchy sex. I would not recommend this book.
1,"Sad efffort, but at least it was an effort","I had just finished a book at work, and was bored, I saw this book laying on the counter, so picked it up and began to skim through it. The best part of this book is the scenery. Hoag does an excellent job of putting you in the character shoes, you get an excellent sense of location. And that is about as far as you get. The storyline builds at a steady pace, the characters seem viable, but they never quite finish the race. Sex scenes and obscure monologues plague the story frequently. I thought this was a suspense book, but the only suspense I found was waiting for the suspense part to pop up.I never plan on reading anything else by Hoag, first time, shame on you, second time....its not gonna happen. This isnt a suspense novel, and it isnt a crime procedural. It cannot be defined as an action novel. You could go on forever about what this story isnt, and you will never get any closer to what it actually IS. Some may enjoy it, I did not."
1,Is this a suspense novel??,"I've read other books by Tami Hoag and enjoyed most, but I found this one boring. I actually put this one aside for a few weeks and read other books before getting back to this one. The characters in the book didn't keep my attention and I truly didn't care less if they survied. I will keep reading Tami, but this was a disappointment."
4,"Strong Characters, Slow Plot","I feel this book is a little long and the plot a little slow. There were several scenes that I felt were unnecessary. However, the character development was superb. I loved the characters of JD and Marilee. I would have given the book five stars, but the book was more of a romance that had a little mystery thrown in. Many of Hoag's other books have a lot of mystery with a little romance for flavor. I didn't know ""who did it"" until around page 400. Although I feel Hoag's best work is ""Night Sins"" (with the best character of her work being Mitch and Megan), ""Dark Paradise"" runs a close second. Not a book to read in one night, but if you're patient, will stay with you."
1,JUNK!,"This has to be the biggest disappointment I've ever purchased. The keyboard controls are horrible, and look out, if you hit the ""Windows"" key on accident, the game pops out into windows and locks up, a hard reboot is required. Save yourself the time and money, not worth it at all. Wish I had never bought it."
5,Coca Cola Never Sounded so Nice.,"Sharlene Hector's beautiful spiritual ballad (As originally performed by Nina Simone) is sung for the whole world to hear in a Coca Cola Commerical. The second song on the album is also a delight, done is much of the same style. It's clear that this girl's got a career ahead of her.If you enjoy Sharlene, you might also enjoy Nina Simone, the deep alto voice who's given us hits such as 'Feeling Good' (in many of Six Feet Under's commericals)."
3,"Great photos, poor captioning.","You have to look at this book for what it is: a photo chronicle of the XB-70. The photos are excellent, and there are many I haven't seen previously. Unfortunately, you won't get much new information out of the captioning. Even worse, the captioning is very poorly written. This book needed a good editor!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have been looking for good servingware for a long time and was excited to find this bowl. I could not be happier with the purchase, and in fact bought many items in the line (all of which are fantastic). It's a substantial piece, heavy-duty, with great coloring. I can't wait to use it for company! Highly recommend!"
3,Not as expected,"The bowl is smaller than stated. While it is 120 oz. to the very tippy top of the bowl, the mixing area is smaller than the bowl I am replacing (which was less oz.) and will not work for what I purchased it. It also came with a glazing flaw on the rim, and should be sold as a second (and at second't pricing.) Oveall pretty, and ok for small cakes."
4,An inspiring story for all,"Do you think you could survive as a 13 year old trying to survive hiking the Appalachian Trails? Well, Dani can. 115-pound Dani is frustrated and angered by her parent's divorce and just wants away from it all.Kimberly Brubaker Bradley has created a moving story about a girl, Dani that runs away and hike the Appalachian Trails. A story of grief, survival, and hope that takes a refreshingly candid, nuanced look at complex emotions. While Dani is hiking the Appalachian Trails, she meets some friends along the way.This book is realistic fiction, prequel, and female readers would greatly enjoy this book. A pre group of people would enjoy this book around the ages of 9-13. Also people that are interested in hiking the Appalachian Trails, because it sure gives you a little taste of the woods and trails. Bradley has written other books such as Ruthie's Gift, One-of-a-Kind Mallie, and Weaver's Daughter.-Callie Fultz"

4,"Fast service, but more precise description needed","Fast service, but not quite what I expected from the description. Turned out to be a children's book."
2,Pass,"I have never played #2 or #3, but from what I've read and heard, they have all the parts of this game that I didn't like amplified. I originally rented this years ago in a quest for a new platform in between Spyros. It was kind of cute, but everything just seemed dull and repetitive. No puzzles, missions, or anything. Just firing at enemies. Eventually I got to an area where I couldn't find the way through, passed the controller on."
2,kind of cool,this game is fun for a wile but then it gets hard .And when you die like say when you die on one of the miisons you haft to start allv over on the first level even if your on the last level. so if your good at video gams buy this game but if your not dont buy it.
5,on my top 5 fave games fool!!!,"This is my 3rd fave game currently. Its just so much fun here is the good and bad.Pros:-Great animation and environments-Funny scripts and characters-Great weapons such as the R.Y.N.O.-Huge replayability. You can go back and find ""Gold Bolts"" and ""Skill Points"" you may not have found earlier and you can revisit bosses, races, and jet fights.-Really good gameplay!It has a really comfortable control system and seems oddly familiarCons:-Gathering money takes really long to get new weapons especially the R.Y.N.O. which comes at a whopping 150,000 bolts!-You cant revisit turrets-Some enemies wont appear again after you beat the game-Hard to figure out how to use cheats!As you can see these are really silly cons. Who needs cheats anyways. Using cheats to beat the game sucks. Dont let any of the cons keep you from buying this game. [...] Go buy the game you [...]!Scurry!!! Git!!! Hurry!!! Now!!! Fetch!!!"
4,One of the few playstation games that are better than Jak,"Rachet and Clank is totally awesome!!! It has lots of weapons and gadets and you could also get be Clank! You get to travel to different planets and fight different kinds of robots, aliens, and creatures!! There are also vending machines that you could weapons and ammo for them too. And if you lose all heath you won't have to start over. I can't wait to get the second one of it!"
5,Platformer - Yes. Linear - Yes. Fun - Yes.,"This is probably the best linear, platformer, ""buddy""(even though Ratchet & Clank hate each other in the middle of the game)game.---------------WARNING---------------THE GAME ENTITLED 'RATCHET &CLANK;' CAN CAUSE YOU TO LOSE SLEEP AND NOT DO THE DAILY CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. (Yes, it's THAT addictive. Is that bad? No. So buy it.)YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
4,This game is ok,"There are good things and bad things about this game. If you look at other reveiwer's reveiws, you'll see that a lot of them are five stars. I agree that this game is five stars when you start playing, but things get harder. When you first start playing this game, you'll probably think: This game is sweet!They graphics are ausome,(which I agree is very true)there is lots of action, and bad guys to kill with all kinds of weapons. Soon you'll be stuck in a spot either because one part is way to hard to beat, or you can't figure out what to do next."
4,GREAT GAME FOR KIDS,"This game is a classic. It's the first in a large series of Ratchet & Clank games. My son now owns just about all of the different Ratchet & Clank games and this is still one of his favorites. Every Ratchet & Clank games has different weapons and levels. This game will entertain your kids for many hours. They can freely roam many different worlds, defeat enemy's and finish objective in order to more on to different worlds. Rest assured there is no foul language of any sort in this game. This game is one player only and there is no online option."
5,Delightful!!,"Remember the old, good, Spyro?? Well if you enjoyed that, then prepare for something twice as tasty, served up with flawless gameplay. Ratchet and Clank is a stunner, and I can honestly say that I've seldom had a better PS2 experience. Well done, Insomniac Games!"
5,great game low cost,awesome game. i was reluctant to buy it but when i did i couldn't believe how great it was!!!!
5,fun game,this is a very fun game if you are into rpgs. most of the game is easy except for a few parts. i really liked it and finished it in a week.
4,Teacher and Engineer,"The explanation for each particular topic is very concise and clear. I would recommend to have a look if it is available in your library. However, I would give a 5 star rating if the book provides more examples and visual aids."
5,For the Price this is Excellent.,"The quality and look of this portfolio are superb, for the price you can't find better. Perfect for my 13 x 19. Thank you."
1,Yeah right,"I can not believe these reviews this game is like.. a total outcast. Yeah the 3-d animation is kinda cool but they over do it. Their heads are perfectly smooth somtimes circular. And who ever heard of a 4 foot tall kid jumping 11 ft in the air for a football and then practicaly float to the ground. All the characters are really slow no mater how fast the ratings say. and when they takle it looks like the tackler tripped instead of tackle. you maybe guessing why i even gave it a 1 star, its because it is so darn easy! No mater how many times you play it you can get tired really quick."
1,Over-hyped,"This is the ""Howard the duck"" of this years video games. I don't understand the good reviews it has gotten other than these are kids talking. Not for the mature gamer. Man it's bad....."
3,"A good,moody later episode.","This episode was one of the last in the original Outer Limits show. It's story was quite original. It was about a small group of scientists who recreate a miniature version of a distant planet. Every detail of the planet is the same as the original, from the plants to the animals. But with the planet they also create something else. They create the spirit of the planet which kills in darkness. Soon the scientists have to battle the spirit to survive. This episode wasn't as good as some but had a unique story and moody photography. All in all it was an average episode in this excellent series."
1,From a Sinatra & Cole Porter fan - Do NOT buy this CD..,"I have many Cole Porter and Sinatra CDs and this is probably the worst of both. Cole Porter would be embarassed by the versions of some of his most beautiful songs in this CD and Sinatra should be.Just to be fair, the recordings do have some historical value but it's really not a good representation of Sinatra's recordings of Cole Porter songs.You can find beautiful recordings of Sinatra singing Cole Porter's best like ""Night and Day"", ""You're the Top"" and many others in different compilations. It's just about the versions chosen for this one which are no good. The recordings are cheesy and represent Sinatra ""playing for the crowds"" of dazzled housewifes instead of using his voice and talent to really interpret the songs. The background singing is often depressing."
5,Have Olivia Over For Christmas,"This is a must have for Christmas. It has some traditional and some original songs. Great duets with Vince Gill, Kenny Loggins and Clint Black. Olivia sounds fantastic as always! This is the perfect cd to get into the Christmas spirit. I just decorated my house while this was playing. It will now be a tradition in our house. Sure to be enjoyed by all ages."
1,This computer is a throwaway,"The computer has so little memory and storage space that I had to junk it after owning it for a couple of years. It turned me off PCs forever, and I now own a MACbook."
2,Just a printed version of Cubase manual,"I was looking for a comprehensive Cubase reference, and this book looked like I could buy. The big disappointment came when I started reading first chapters. It looked very famililar. Of course, it was just a regular Cubase manual - only printed out for me comparing to electronic PDF version. I compared tables of contents - identical except for 40 page tutorial added to a printed version...If you own original Cubase CD, then you'll find better ways to spend your fifty bucks."
3,downgrade from Yo si me enamore,"This cd does not reach the beauty and success of Yo si me enamore. The lyrics throughout this cd are pretty trashy especially the bacardi party one. It's pretty insulting to listen to. Some fun beats in this cd, but huey could really do better."
5,Awesome Pride!!!!,"This is, beside's Pride 10 and 8 the best Pride event ever. 6 hours of pure action. Watch the most memorable fight of the year as Royce Gracie takes on the greatest fighter pound for pound in the world today Sakuraba. See Igor Vovchanchin, Mark Coleman and Mark Kerr all fight for the title of ""Pride GP 2000 winner"". To top it off the return of Ken Shamrock, watch him battle Alexander Otsuka, a man who defeated Marco Ruas and went the distance with Igor Vovchanchin and Renzo Gracie. The greatest 8 man tourney ever with 2 superfights, miss this at your peril."
4,Good buy... for new Incognito fans,"I'm a big incognito fan who has all of there albums. So to get me to purchase this CD was not a hard sell. However, this would be a great buy for the individual who wants to get a lot of the good songs from a talented musical group from England with out purchasing a bunch of CD's. You get great songs such as, ""still a friend of mind"", ""a shade of blue"", ""colibri"" and ""deep waters"". By the way there are a lot of great incognito songs not on this CD. Hopefully this CD would motivate a person new to incognito to go out and purchase other CDs."
4,Thumbs up!!!,"Sexy... Amusing...Touching...Predictable... A quick read. You will be tempted to read it in one day, but pace yourself. I wish I had!"
2,"Daisy May Be Back, But Ms. Gibson Is On Vacation!","I hate to jump on a bandwagon and like most that have reviewed this book I also pre-ordered it but to add insult to injury I then saved it for my Spain vacation--what better way to spend a vacation but to soak up some sun and read a great book?!?!?! Well, my bad, great sun, not so great book. In fact I donated my copy to the hotel library. As you have already probably read the characters are not at all likeable (not one single one!!!), the plot is sad, and in the end there was none of the trademark Gibson humor to see you through. Do yourself a favor and borrow this one from a friend or buy it second hand. This is not Ms. Gibson's best effort but I do truly look forward to her next book. Let's face it you can't always be on top and this one is really on the bottom."
2,Disappointed,"This is a beautiful birdbath, and a great addition to my yard. However, after less than 6 months, the birdbath's glue failed and I found the dish part on the ground. Fortunately, it wasn't broken. I returned the item and they kindly sent me another one, only to have the same glue failure to occur in less that 3 months with the new unit. Looks good but does not last!"
1,Small and Incomplete,"The bowl is beautiful but very very small. I would have been willing to keep it but then the stake was missing a part so I couldn't put it together. For the price, low risk and easy return."
4,Chihuly inspired birdbath,"I am pleased with the overall look of this birdbath. It is exactly as pictured. It is a bit on the small side for a birdbath, but my birds will just have to deal with it. The glass is absolutely beautiful and the blues stand out against the wooded background. I haven't seen any of the advertised illuminarie effect, so I am taking off a 1/2 a star for that. My biggest complaint is that the stake in which you attach the birdbath had a section to screw in, but the threads were clogged up and we couldn't get it to screw all the way in (another 1/2 star deduction). I nearly sent it back until we decided we could screw it in as far as possible and shove the stake into the ground to help provide stability."
4,Inspirational!,"As an educator, I enjoyed the stories in this book. There was a quote for each two page entry which prepared me for the story to come. I could relate to every story, whether it was something that I had experienced or heard about. Teachers often get caught up in the discussion in the lunchroom. This book will remind you to stay away and think positive. This book reminded me why I decided to become a teacher. Just like many other teachers, I am at school or doing schoolwork all hours of the day and night. The stories in this book touched my heart and reminded me that all that work is worth it!!"
5,great product.,"necessary for runners! great product for late night or even early morning runs.easy to wear, doesn't rub. highly recommended."
1,If you are a major pessimest...,"...you will love this book.If you have one iota of faith in anything, you will probably not even finish reading it.Which is what I did.I read about the first 10 pages at the bookstore, and that was all I needed, if you like reading the most negative book in the world...buy it."
5,a must read for any student of metaphysics,"For many years this book was my constant companion. I love the way Florence Scovel Shinn demonstrates the path of intuition and positive expectancy. This is an absolute classic in the new thought genre, a must read as far as I'm concerned. I was inspired to name my company Divine Design because of it. As relevant today as when it was written..."
5,Dan Colameco is a Star in the making!!!!!!,"I happened upon this cd one day and it caught my eye. WOW! You literally will be blown away by this music! Pay particular attention to Danny Colameco, an up and cummer in the Upper Darby musical theater seen! Little Danny C, who also goes by his stage name, Gap boy 13, steals the show! If Jesus and Barbara Streisand had a baby, it would sound like Danny Colameco! His ambiguously gay portrayal may seem distracting to some people, but he makes up for it in show stopping moves and charismatic bravado! Trust me, take my advice and buy this cd! It is a life altering piece of musical genious! Danny and who ever his life partner may be should be very proud of the work he has done here. I look forward to his next work, which I believe is a musical interpretation of tracking records. Well Done Gab Boy 13!"
1,HORRIBLE ink efficiency,"I have had this printer for a while and we have probably spent more on ink than on the printer, don't buy this printer unless you absolutely can't afford a laser, which will get you a whole lot more prints per cartridge."
3,"Good, when it works",Generally speaking I like this camera. The zoom quality is phenomenal. However I do agree with many that you have to hold very still in order to get great pictures. Once you get used to that you will do ok.Unfortunately once I got used to that the lens motor stopped working and is stuck in the out position.
1,Very Noisy Headset,"At first this headset seemed fine.. I would say for the first 5 calls. Then after that everyone I called complained that they couldn't hear me and there was a lot of noise on the call. This was a total waste of my money. I was using this headset with a Blackberry Curve and a headset adapter was needed with the headset. I don't think it was the adapter because another headset worked fine. As far as the fit of the ear piece, that was okay, it was hard to hold it in my ear at times. The little wire that comes down to your mouth is very flimsy also. The bottom line is, I definitely wouldn't waste your time or money on this headset."
5,Great product,"Works well, made well, especially cleans engine wheels that have a build-up. Box makes a functional storage case. Well constructed."
5,Early Sinatra,"Early Sinatra at his best. The phrasing and carryover into the lyrics is simply, SINATRA!"
1,A hellish reading experience.,"Some books you treasure forever. Others make you mourn them as they tree corpses they are. Alas, this is one of the latter. ""Lucifer State"" reads like a winning entry in the Bulwer-Lytton contest, with its overblown prose and hamfisted attempts at literary symbolism. It actually includes a glossary of allusions made in the text. As a work of art, it is unintentionally humorous and fatally flawed. As a textbook, it is a torture device. Spend your book budget on one of the many more compelling works in the field of rhetoric."
2,Its just a knife not really a bayonet,"Its an O.K. knife definitely looks impressive and is stainless steel, but it is not a bayonet, it does not fit on an M-16 or AR-15, they got the measurements wrong and the barrel will not fit through the ring."
3,Not as popular anymore,"This CD was ordered while back. Looking back she was popular and could sell lots of products for a hight prices. Not anymore. Now what we goona do with all these cd we have?Back then it was a big deal-Madonna.Little expencive for CD, but that it what made her reach."
2,Deceptive title,"This title is deceptive because the book contains no contribution whatsoever by the Dala Lama himself. The contributors are all scholars but the most authentic and closest to the Dala Lama is probably his French interpreter, Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard."
5,The best of the Jam Packs,"I've bought three of the packs before and I just bought this one. At first I wasn't sure what it could really do for my sound, but it is absolutely amazing. The African choir will shock you, it sounds so good. The new instrument sounds will give your music a broader, more worldly sound. It's worth the buy even if you just want to pay around with it. It's the best one that I've bought yet."
5,Love it!,The cards are so beautiful and the book answers pretty much any question i would have. I love this set so much.
2,disappointed,"The images online seem a lot more vibrant and with a lot more depth. When I got my set I was incredibly disappointed with the cards. The pictures are flat with little contrast. Other than the images not being true in color and tensity to what is shown on the website the deck itself is interesting with all the different ""clues""."
4,"Interesting, but possibly fragile","I've owned one of these for about 6 months now. I have dropped it a few times. The case has developed micro-cracks at the sharp corners. More problematic is that it has a memory fault I discovered while installing Fedora 8. I would recommend obtaining a Fedora 8 i386 boot disk and performing a memtest upon receipt of the device.It works somewhat with Linux/Fedora. The thumb-stick functions as a mouse, ethernet works, I have heard wireless works, and the touchscreen worked somewhat for me. It can be booted from many usb DVD drives (there is a BIOS option to select a USB CD/DVD drive as a boot device).It is an interesting product, in that I could have a good use for it. It could be improved by making the case more durable."
3,Recommended? Yes and no,"It works good for me at glance. However, there are many things that you need to consider before making your decision. The first thing is it does not come with a program that we could use along with the stylus instead of using keyboard like other devices such as tablet PC or Pocket PC, so it is very inconvenient when you take it to a conference room or something, you always have to put your attention on typing on the very small keyboard. The next thing is the battery just lasts arount two hours, not four hours as advertise. It should be shipped with a better battery for such a portable unit like this, especially it is designed to use as a mobile phone too. In addition, the solution of the screen is the most inconvenient. It was 1024 x 600 instead of 1024 x 768 and it causes many dialogs and screens have part of it disappear. There are many more things that you need to consider about."
3,"If you want to use it's GPRS, think twice... It may not work in your country operater!","I bought to use it in Turkiye. But I cannot access to internet. This product uses Sony Ericsson'un CG83 EDGE Modem (850Mhz, 1800Mhz, 1900Mhz). My GSM operator (Turkcell 900MHz) and others (Avea and Vodafone) doesn't work with it. I try to find a solution and reach a blog. I have to buy a GSM adaptor to access to internet! If you want to buy and use outside of USA, Think twice. Reach to your operator and ask that."
4,Super cool,"After a month every time I get this out on the train, I think - Cool this is a joy to hold. I exported this to the UK for GBP 720 rather than the GBP 2000 it costs here to buy the equalevent model. The HD is fine, you don't need solid state. The dual networking WLAN and mobile phone is great and works a treat.Two regrets, the Keyboard is rubbish, difficult to use quickly and, as a Mac user who uses OS X all day and I had forgotten how poor Windows was - it was a bit of a shock to have use an operating system that so unfriendly and unreliable.Would definitely buy again, if you need a UMPC this is the one."
5,LOVE THESE FOR PROTECTION AGAINST THORNS,"I love these gloves! I am new to gardening but I have about 12 rose bushes and these are the only thing I use to tend to them. I can prune my roses and just pick up the stems no problem and not worry about getting poked! I am buying another pair for my mom to use, she loves the feel of them they are real quality leather, and she will use them just to water her plants and do some light pruning. Great gloves good for all kind of gardening, really protects your arms. No more coworkers asking if I have a cat, from all the scratches on my forearms. LOL. :-)"
2,Tatoo Review,The tatoos are beautiful. Very detailed and very cute. I wanted them for a children's birthday party so I ordered a pack. It would have been nice to know the quantity ahead of time. Assumed it would be a pack. But it was only 4 tatoos in a little folder. Cute but scant.
2,family values?,"About half way through this movie it hit me how and why Hollywood and various journalists had heaped praise upon A Home of Our Own as fine family fare: it spews, through the endlessly repeated cursings od star Kathy Bates, contempt for and reviles the "" g...d.. Irish Catholic"" father.A Home of Our Own promotes the Feminist cliches with the self-sufficient, never-say-die single woman constantly reminding the audience that her dead husband was worthless. It promotes the cliches of both the national WASP establishment and the Jewish elites of Hollywood, journalism, and academia with Bates' foul-mouthed contempt for the Catholic Church and Irishness.What is wrong with that, beside the fact that no can can make and get aired a film that does the opposite, is that this mess is marketed as family entertainment. That is like claiming that The Last Temptation of Christ is a Christian movie."
1,Ear plugs and blindfolds . . .,". . . are in order if you intend to watch this movie with your kids. My last review on it didn't seem to be much appreciated, so I'll site some of the specific reasons why I hate it. Mrs. Lasy constantly refers to her late husband as a #*&%$ Irish Catholic @#*&% - right in front of her kids. How is that supposed to make them feel? It is so dishonoring (and prejudiced). One of her little boys, in particular, needs his mouth washed out with soap. ""Are you gonna sqeeze her b**bies?"" he askes his brother, as he is getting ready for a date. C'mon. How gross is that? I can't believe that the average rating for this movie is almost five stars."
2,"Good Looks, Horrible Sound","This trumpet looks awesome but the sound is just horrible. I have an old dented trumpet that sounds better than this. Good for kids just starting, but bad if you have been playing a while. Definitely sending this back."
4,"Much better than Herstein, not as advanced as D&F","I ""grew up"" on Gallian, which I think is a pretty good text. I think this text is more complete than Herstein, and if the students are not advanced enough for Dummit and Foote, this is the text to pick.For those advanced mathematicians out there, I highly recommend considering Dummit and Foote's text. It is very advanced, but also very readable."
4,More Than You'd Expect...,"Shuster was telling people at the convention we attended, ""You don't have to know anything about rugby to enjoy it,"" and he wasn't just trying to sell his book. Let's say you're flipping channels one night and you discover a Tales From The Crypt marathon with a rugby theme. Intriguing, huh? That's pretty much what Sevanacide is--a sometimes surprising, sometimes disturbing, slightly tongue-in-cheek collection of seven Crypt-ish tales more entertaining than mere warnings not to bother with things you don't understand. It's a quick read done in a light, easy style. Shuster sets up the scenario, then gets to the point right away. I could easily see each of these stories as short films, part of a miniseries, or collected into one big filmed production. Don't despair if your knowledge of rugby goes no further than how to spell it--Sevenacide is a nice little collection perfect for a spooky beach read, road trip, or as a gift for that rugby player or fan."
3,"Okay, but not worth the money","This is a very thin book. I would recommend finding simply written stories--5 or 6 sentences that are reproducible (or that you've written), typing them up, and cutting them up into strips for students to arrange. Even at $6, I don't think this book is worth it."
2,Not as pictured. No longer made with chamois.,"Picture of item is misleading. The swab is no longer made with chamois just made out of microfiber.Description talkes about ""swab expands to contact the entire bore"" this is no longer the case.(You have to look for a long time to find a picture of what is now being shipped.)At $25 this item is too expensive for what you get. There are all types of ""microfiber"" swabs at a much lower cost.I did not return this item as it was better than nothing. (I received a new saxophone on the same day and had to have something to clean it.)"
5,Essential Willie.,This is a very fast moving album. It's the next best thing to going to one of his concerts.Highly recommended.
2,Warning! Warning!,"I like Camper Van Beethoven. I like Fleetwood Mac's Tusk. This CD is an amusing idea. Unfortunately, hearing this once is enough, and then you'll be sorry you spent your money on it. Some of it is funny, but a lot of it is unlistenable. Try to find a way to hear this without buying it and spend your money on any other Camper CD."
3,Ultimately Disappointing,"I was initially excited about this release, but upon a couple of listens I quickly realized that if I wanted to hear ""Tusk"" it was best to just play the classic Fleetwood Mac album.If you are fan of CVB and NOT a fan of Fleetwood Mac, then you'll probably enjoy this a lot more than those of us who are fans of both groups."
2,Seems Written Just to Pay for their House,"Of all the travel memoirs I've read, I'm sorry to say that this one is the least engaging. I've been an admirer of David Leavitt's writing for a very long time, but reading this I couldn't help but feel (again and again) that it was just thrown together haphazardly as a means of paying for the couple's house. Well, why not? Except it just doesn't interest much. It's a shame. A great missed opportunity. For a better read read Annie Hawes' Extra Virgin and its sequel Ripe for the Picking, and At Home in France by Ann Barry."
5,Very good,"This book was definatly one of my fovorites. It tells about a boy who's dad just got remarried, and has a new stepsister. The stepsister is into spiderwick chronicles. It's a wonderful story, and I definatly recomend it for children 8-12. They find a nixie, and fight a giant! It was an amazing book, I have to tell you. I can't wait until the next book comes out. Holly Black and Toni Diterlizzi (?) are a great team when they pair up. I have to say this is one of my favorites. Well, I guess some people wouldn't like it, but i'm a faerie freak all the same.It turns out, Jared and Simon Grace are real.and thats realy cool. This story is based on a fans point of view. Definatly buy it the next time yoy see it."
5,ANOTHER AMAZING CHAPTER,"the L.A.Guns have once again released a first class effort! This disc should help clear up any doubts about if rock is dead or not. This CD is by far the best new album I have heard all year and truly deserves all the success it can possibly attain. Tell your friends, and anyone else you know, this disc must be owned."
4,"I got lost, in the world of Marbles","Recently, I really started thinking about Marbles, and wanted to learn more.Discoveries...America Special Edition, MarblesThis was a wonderful video. It talks about how marbles are made, by hand as well as machine made marbles. It also talks about the National Marble Tournament in Wildwood, N.J. Very informative, fun to watch. Would recommend to anyone who loves or wants to know more about marbles."
2,What is that song with the piano,Can someone please tell me the name of the piece of music that drifts in and out of the movie a few times. It is a piano playing a very soft tune. Thanks
3,NEED THE ARTIST & SONG TITLE,"What is the name of that song/music and who is the artist that is playing when Hal sees the little burn victim, Cadence, as she really is for the first time????? They use that music a couple times in the movie but I can't find it!!"
3,???????,WHAT THE HELL IS THE NAME OF THE SONG THAT PLAYS WHEN HAL GETS OUT OF THE CAR TO FOLLOW ROSEMARY INTO THE CLOTHING STORE. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
3,"Top tunes in the film, but where are they now?","The soundtrack still has some great tracks from the likes of Sheryl Crow and PJ Harvey, however the CD lacks some of my preferred tunes, King of Convenience's 'Toxic Girl' (when Hals sees Rose for the first time) and the excellent French disco tune 'Too Young' by Phoenix (when Hal is dancing with the three ugly girls).Great film! - good soundtrack but you may still find yourself searching for your favourites in the credits."
2,Myeagh,"Why is there no Ivy songs on this cd. Yet again I am burnt by a soundtrack that doesn't contain any of the score music.This film had one of the best scores I've ever heard and yet there is not a whif of it on the cd.Instead I get songs by 'Neil Young' and 'The Foundations' good artist's, but not what I wanted. The Cake song 'Comfort Eagle' was used twice in the film and doesn't even appear once on the cd. To add insult to my wallets injury, in Cakes place we get a track that wasn't even in the film. .... ...."
3,"RE: Right artist, wrong song. A music fan from USA","This review was very helpful to me. At the end of the movie, I watched the song titles scroll, not paying much attention. the very last song, ""While We're In Love"" by Ivy, caught my attention.I didn't get the artist's name or song title, so I came here & played samples from the soundtrack.still didn't hear it.In reading the review from "" A music fan from USA,"" I went to the Ivy album mentioned, and there it was! Hugs & thanks for making my search so easy! Another Music Fan From USA!"
2,missing songs!!!,I can't believe some of the most important songs in the movie are missing in the soundtrack. Whatever happened to that beautiful song when Hal looks at the girl with the burnt face for the second time? (...)
1,Threw It Away After the First Play,"I don't know what movie they got this music from, but it's nothing that I remember from Shallow Hal. Don't waste your money."
3,A Snug Fit,"First of all, the cap is very tight on there. Hard to pull off, which actually could be a good thing if you are worried about losing your cap. I do like it that the key ring loop is at the USB end instead of the cap end. I gave this item 3 stars because it seems like it works well, but what I don't like about it is that it is wide, so when I have it plugged in, I can't use the other USB port next to it. Not very practical!"
2,"It was great, while it lasted","I bought this in mid-Feb, received in late Feb, used maybe once a week until the last couple days. You know how sometimes a badly treated wire goes bad so it only works when you hold or kink it just so? Well, that's what happened to this, except I treated the wire like a king, very gentle, precisely because I was afraid of it going bad. And now it's bad and useless after under 3 months. Of course it's too late to return it. What is it with iPod accessories that they go bad so quickly? I really want to buy another one because in all other respects this battery pack was just great, but I don't want to because this really didn't last as long as it should have under the gentle treatment I gave it."
4,Works as promised,"Works perfectly, even with the iPod 5 gen. The package says it is incompatible but that's only if you use the included clip. I only gave it 4 stars because of the very cheap plastic that was used in the construction. If not careful, it will break when removing the battery cover. Use rechargeable AA batteries for the longest use. I am very pleased."
5,This Is The One,This is great! You'll get at least 25 hours of Music without using a second of the iPod battery. I've had it for over a month I use it every day I'm still on my first set of batteries.Then you still have approximately 12 more hours depending on your iPod.Just get it knowing this will not charge your iPod battery and will not work if your iPod battery is dead. Enjoy!
3,Not Compatible with iPod Touch,"This product comes up with the search terms ""iPod touch battery backup"" but is NOT compatible with that unit.Beware."
4,worked fine for a while,this was the greatest purchase ever until some random screen started to pop up. in the middle of my movie it would say that the device could not support the ipod. but for some reason once the screen went away i still had a lonnnng battery
4,It works -great way to get more playback time out of the Ipod,"I had the Maxell backup battery pack for two weeks. It works fine. I get 15 to 25 hours more of playback time (depending of the batteries you use) I use NiMh rechargeables, the same kind I need for my digital camera so it is very convenient.I got rid of the ipod clip provided with the product because it doesn't fit my 30gb video with a protector case on. I have a custom made leather case with a special pocket for the battery pack so it's very easy to transport.The Maxell pack adds weight and bulk to the ipod but I guess it is the price you pay for convenience. The battery status leds are not very accurate but give you a general idea of the charge left.I wish there's a black one, to match my ipod but since it goes in the leather case it doesn't matter much to me.It does what I wanted it to do but could be smaller."
1,Does not work with Touch 3g,"Shipping was very fast, put the 4 AA batteries in, My Ipod Touch 3G was at about 90% discharged, plugged it in, Ipod Touch gave me a message that it is not a support accessory. Called Amazon, they quickly sent me a return label. Still searching for a good solution that uses disposable batteries that work with the IPod Touch 3G.If anyone knows of a good solution please comment. Thanks"
4,"Use double A's (""AA"") with your iPod.","Been using this for about a year.Why you need this? Because eventually your iPod rechargeable battery will die and it cause a fortune to replace it.Also, if you play movies. I use my Ipod to watch movies in the car for the kids. I plug the Ipod to the TV via A/V cable.Lastly, if you play lossless formats. Lossless eats up about 40 megabytes per song compared to a regular 5-megabyte mp3s'. Your iPod drive need to spin more often and drain your juice like a translyvannian vampire.Pros:-Simple and easy to use. Just place 4 ""AA"" batteries, connect to Ipod and switch ON.-Reasonable price-Low battery indicatorCons:-Very short cable to Ipod. Really, everytime I use it; I wish it has a longer cable.-Why not available in black? How about owners of black Ipods?-This is a battery back-up and will not charge your Ipod-It uses ""AA's"". So, if you do not mind the bulk.5 start for usability, 4 stars for design"
2,not working,Did not work with my i pod would not sync with it. Very disappointed with this product . Would not recommend.
4,Gives you a whole different perspective,"At the beginning I had to read this book for school. I was ready to force myself upon it, setting up a schedule for how many pages I needed to read a night. After the first few pages however I was hooked. It starts out mysterious and you dont really understand it all until the end. Even after I was through reading it I went on the internet to research it! Dont judge this book from its cover, like I did. Read it, its very good!"
5,One of a kind...,"This book is written for anyone interested in Classic French Cuisine. It lists names of the Classic dishes listed by Escoffier, sectioned by where the dish would appear in a classic menu. Along with each dish comes a brief description of preparation and ingredients.However, the beginner cook will probably not be able to appriciate this book as it doesn't tell you anything in detail about how to prepare the dishes, measurements, cooking times or temperatures. I may act as inspiration for something new to learn though, as there are so many different dishes packed in this little book that it gives a good overview about French Cuisine.You will not regret buying this book if you are in the habit of buying cookbooks for entertaining reading or for reference."
1,What is this?,"I have not read the book yet, but I'd like to say that the kindle version of the book is messy. Where is the table of contents? There are a lot of problems with the kindle version. Please, fix it!!!!!!"
1,I gave up,"I started this book, put it down, then started it again. Finally, I put it down and won't be picking it up again. It failed to grab my attention from the get-go. It seems like it took forever for anything to happen. And, it was incredibly boring. I am disappointed with the plethora of paranormals around lately. I am afraid that authors have to write this genre of book and either aren't wild about doing it, or they jump in too quickly and don't fully develop their story.Sherrilyn Kenyon has such a fully developed Dark Hunter, etc. world that her books really pull you in. Karen Marie Moning and her fairy stories are built upon of layer after layer of well researched and written material. This book just didn't get my attention, so I decided to move on in hopes of coming across something worth reading."
2,My review of the Nokia 8801,"I don't like the phone and havent from the beginning. I have owned it for 6 months and still don't like it. The battery life is terrible, the keys are so small that it makes text messaging very difficult. The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap. The seal around the glass covering the screen began leaking 3 months ago and recently cracked. I would not reccomend this phone to anyone. And the reception is poor even in metro Atlanta."
4,good relieve,"They really helped my 9 y.o.(level 4) gymnast with her heels' pain but in one of Cheetah Heels the inside fabric started to unglue from the main body in two different places. It's been 4 weeks since I goot these. She is 78 lb and size 4 in shoes, I got M and it is very hard to put it on. I'll go with Large next time. Also one is bigger then the other. I expected it to last longer."
5,MY PAIN STOP,"I could not belibe what this do for my in only 3 days it almost disapeared my awfull pain, I can walk and it isn't a tourture. buy it dont dubt it"
1,Save your money***,"If I could rate this as a less than ""zero"" I would! I purchased this for support for Plantar Faciatis, the arch supoort is virtually non-existant and the only thing it has going for it is a heel cup that unless you have a narrow heel is useless. Anyone that purchases this would be better off buying a good support shoe/sneaker and add a quality insole if you need additional support. This is hot to wear and uncomfortable and has a tendency to roll around the edges when you insert your foot into your shoes. Who need a girdle for you foot and ankle really..."
4,Good product!,Beats the heck out of taping a heal pad to deal with heel bruise or plantar fasciitis. It does not hamper gymnastics performance moves and provides support as well as cushioning shock.
3,Not for me,"The product it fine, it just didnt help my problem. So as far as I am concerned, not so great."
1,Shop around,"I was tempted to buy from this company due to the lower cost than other companies were selling it for. After seeing that the item was IN STOCK, I purchased 2 heel cups. I was given a week for my shipment. The day my order was suppose to arrive, Allegro medical sent me an e-mail stating my order was on Backorder and the product should be shipped in 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks passed, I called the company and they informed me that it was STILL on backorder. I would of not known that unless I contacted them. Therefore I ended up canceling my order. The company's customer service guy was very nice and apologetic, but it doesn't help the fact that it is now over a month since I placed the order and I have no product, plus the company is still posting that the product is IN STOCK. Shop somewhere else, it is worth the extra money!"
2,Does not fit well,I ordered the one size fits all because the rest only go up to 140 lbs. This thing is huge and has way too much extra fabric. Unable to wrap it snugly around my foot. Disappointed.
3,A very different perspective!,I liked this book. It offered a very different perspective on so many issues. And the author doesn't beat around the bush when he's making a point. I think some parents and would-be parents could benefit from this book. Not a read for everybody.
1,not the book I thought it would be,"From the first few pages of this book I realized it was not for me. (I did stop reading after the first chapter.) The graphic descriptions of horrible and sad personal stories of children were just too hard to read. These are Christian writers, so I wrongly assumed they would not need to include such graphic details that I can find all over the secular media. I also feel some of the advice about when to have these conversations was premature. I understand we live in a broken world, and am not insulated from it, but I feel this book goes too far."
5,My favorite yoga DVD,"I have many yoga DVDs and this is by far my favorite. It's calming, but challenging for a beginner. I love the full length version but not the express version. The short workout talks through the workout so fast that it's stressful, instead of calming. I love the way d'Silva describes what you should be feeling -- it's unique and creates a positive visual."
4,TV and How it works in our world.,"This book by Dr. Baran explains how the business of TV works in our world. It goes into detail about Ratings, how pilots are created, and how show stays a hit for a long peroid of time. It also goes into how a station makes money through ads, afiliates, and sponsers too. It explains how the V-Chip works and it works. It's a good book if you want to know how the world of Television works."
2,Only made my pain worse.,"I lost my son two months ago. He was my life! Reading this book just added to my pain. I will never have the advantage of a reading from John Edwards. Judy and her friends have had so many. I have received some comunication from my son. These I felt while reading Crossing Over. I am happy for Judy that she has been so blessed I realy am. Reading this book was nice in the beginnig but then I started to wonder, what is wrong with me that I am not getting anything since I started this book. Judy is so blessed and that is great, but it makes me sad that I am not, and it hurts."
1,PLEASE don't waste your money!!,There is no exercise shown on this DVD that should be done on a small trampoline. You'd be better off using a yoga mat. Why would you lie down on a trampoline meant for jumping and try to exercise?
2,HKTS-15 woofer,"The nifty looking woofer, bought with the HKTS-15 speaker system plus AVR-15 series amp, started making gurbling sounds 1 year into use. Called Harman and was told where to take the unit for warranty repair. My warranty said two years on speakers, 1 year on amplifiers. After much delay, the authorized shop said the problem was the amp inside the woofer box and HK would not honor my written warranty. No distinction was noted anywhere on any Harman paperwork - none. Buyer beware!"
1,Way over-priced,The design of the shorts was great but . . . .the material is very flimsy. I have other high-tech fabric shorts so I have comparison items. The cost $80 if not on sale is rediculous. A more reasonable price would be $39. The seller was very nice in accepting returns by the way. I rate the seller 5 stars.
2,Uncertain,"I can't remember if I reviewed this product already....Ok. That was a joke, as this product is supposed to enhance your memory.This product hasn't shown any drastic increases in memory as of yet, and I have been taking the recommended dosage daily.It's been nearly 3 1/2 weeks with no results.Maybe in the next few weeks I'll see some noticeable difference.If so maybe this review will be edited.If not it will stand.I assume I've waited long enough for the supplements to enter my system, and begin to do their job, but I could be wrong.Be warned.Bucky Wilson(...)"
4,IT works,"The effects of this supplement were subtle w/me - but it's nice to be able to report back that it does actually improve my memory and learning.I'm only in 30's, but I'll take any advantage I can get in this world... it's competitive - and you need an edge.(I noticed that this product worked MORE when I STOPPED taking it- that's when it became more obvious)."
5,Simply beautiful...,"Majestic.Beautiful.Moving.Touching.And a lot of feelings that cannot be put into words.From the intro,to the last minutes of the album,a complete serie of emotions shake the listener.From the power of ""Mirror,mirror"",to the sorrow and despair of ""Noldor(Death winter reigns)"",or ""Thorn"".This is a must,for the Tolkien reader.And for those who are not into Tolkien,well,you can find a whole new world that you never thought of.While reading the lyrics,you can find out that Blind Guardian gives a new dimension to the Tolkien writings.The music,and Hansi's singing give a new meaning to the Tolkien world.It simply leaves the listener breathless.A masterpiece."
1,I thought Spin Tap was British.....,"I really like Tolkein's writings and all. The man is an absolute genius. I also like heavy metal like Maiden and Mayhem. However, this powermetal thing (or whatever you want to call it) just makes me cringe. Tolkein makes poor fodder for rock n' roll...including Led Zepplin and my all time favorite band Pink Floyd ( ala Syd Barret era).I was excited when I first bought this album. I even bought the German version before it was even released in the US. When I put it in my player, I was sorely disappointed. I almost laugh at the sheer sillyness of the whole afair.Anyway, that is my opinion."
2,Good songs but the sound is quite poor!,"I have listened to this record a couple of weeks... It's quite catchy but is not THAT GOOD! Hansi sings very good and the solos are quite good too. But sometimes it's REALLY TOO MUCH! I choir with 8 voices can be effectful but if you allways use it it will lose it's meaning, if you understand?... Buy this record if you like powermetal with good melodies and vocals you've never heard anything like."
4,Buy this version!,I just ordered this and wanted to let everyone know that this is the 23-track 2007 remastered edition. So buy it already! Who doesn't want to own a heavy metal concept album about Tolkien's The Silmarillion?
3,Memorable Lyrics,"This is a an approximately 2"" X 3 "" book with two or three line lyrics from Bob Marley Songs. If you need a reminder of his lyrics or need the lyrics highlighted so you can contemplate them without the rest of the song, then this is the book for you. I on the other hand remember most of these lyrics and expected more from this book."
2,Ehhh?,"This is a funny game, a little realistic (besides the abusive mother!)...but the people are views are very small at times and drives me crazy!"
3,Just ok,"I'd recommend some of their newer releases of The Sims for the PS2.. this is definitely a grind in comparison... a step up in graphics from The Sims 1 on the PC, but their following releases on the PS2 are funner with an edge of humor (The Sims 2, The Sims 2 Pets, The Urbz...). Seems unfinished in general. Lack of 'style' (very plain clothes and objects to choose from). The sims are very robotic in movement. After a while of playing their 'Get a Life' mode, I found myself just trying to get the houses over with. More of a pain than fun. Not enough depth."
3,not as good as the pc version,"the graphics were good and everything looked nice but it was harder to play. Instead of using a mouse to move the cursur like on the pc version, you had to move the joystick toggle which took a lot longer to do. The game was okay, but I like the computer version way better."
3,Does Not Work On All PS2 Systems...,"I got this game as a birthday present but it didn't work. So we returned and got another which also did not work. Come to find out as our PS2 was one of the first PS2 systems, it will not work with games that are encoded as The Sims was (i.e. CDs made with blue plastic don't work). However, I love The Sims on the PC so I'm sure had this game worked, I would have loved it. I just wanted to warn some people that this game may not work with their systems. Big disappointment for me! I'm hoping it will come out on GameCube as well."
3,It wasn't that great.,"The first SIMS game I played was SIMS 2 Pets and then I decided to buy this one. The way you control the people is completely different than in SIMS 2.If you first played SIMS 2 DO NOT regress to this one, it's not worth it and you won't like it.However if you have NEVER played the SIMS, then go ahead and start with this one just to get you familiar with it all, and then when you get the SIMS 2 you will be happier because its easier."
5,The Sims PS2,I like this game because it's Sims and Sims is my favorite game on PC PS2 Xbox or any game station there is in the world ok people.
4,The Sims go Console!,"After releasing The Sims (PC Original) EA games and Maxis were on a sure fire hit, with big ratings splashed across international game magazines...The game gave the player ability to play god and control a family of their own. After several releases of official expansion packs, the game developed an edge of adventure; you could now go shopping, go on a date (hot date), go on holiday (vacation) and even own a puppy (unleashed).Now that The Sims have moved to one of the top selling consoles can we expect more? YES! Maxis has always suprised us with new abilities in the game and I am guessing Sims on PS2 won't let us down. Just the new 3D camera angles alone sells the game to many fans. With The Sims Online(PC) recently released and the ability of connecting the PS2 to the worldwide web leaves many doors left open for PS2 and the Sims which could add a whole new dimension to the game in the future."
3,Not a very good attention getter,"I bought this game thinking it would be FUN!instead i got a game that well just got boring after a while. One nice thing about it is that it does have a get a life mode. Other than that if i were you i would get the computer version where you can actually kill your own sim, and you can get expansion packs."
1,Horried Sims Game Ever!!!!!!,Making out IS NOT WHAT I LIKE IN A SIMS GAME!!!!!!!!!! People should respect others that they should live alone. No ruler!!!! People should rate this better. It should be rated M= muture Very muture!!! Bewear People under 13!!!!!
4,Husband think it's fun,"If I were to let him, my husband would play all day! Although I hate that he is down there all the time, I am happy that he has something to keep him occupied."
5,"overall, great buy","ok first, let me say that though the movie may not be the best one I've ever put in my DVD player, it was certianly amusing and interesting, a bit low budget... but I've never faulted a movie for that. NOW as for the Album... I was pleased and impressed with every track but Del's solo track, and that track was decent... He killed it on the mic, but the music is a bit strange. I can't believe no one has mentioned Royce's track yet, I'm not too familiar with Royce da 5'9"" but that track gets me movin yo! and why y'all wanna dis Chali2na and Daakir just cause they did a joint about the wild west? cause thats what it seems like, as the lyrics are still up to par for J5... and I like that beat a lot. DILATED... they have recieved no mention yet, and Downtown is ILL! Heiro gets four tracks and they run it as usual! DTA!!! lemme say that again... DTA!!! all in all, I am VERY glad I purchased this album and I would recommend it to any head out there lookin to expand the collection."
5,A real challenge,"Getting my spouse a watch that is simple, easy to read and most importantly fits a small wrist has been a real challenge. She loves this, and I think it is an excellent option - the 'screw down' setting takes a little while to get used to, but when you realize it makes the watch a more solid and durable option, you'll come to like it too."
3,Lots of orange highlighting,There are MANY passages that are highlighted as if this was used by a student in a class. The description did not say this.
4,"The Healthy Hedonist is delicious for vegans or non-vegans, alike!","No longer will I need to put my poor Vegan friends through an evening of dull side dishes that I formerly used to merely accompany my beef or poultry entree! The recipes in this book are varied in their difficulty or ease, and offer so many delicious options for ingredients to make them pop in flavor and presentation! I have become such a fan, I find myself eating 'vegan meals' without even thinking about the chicken or fish or beef I use to have to have, to call it a 'meal.' There are so many reasons to give this book a try if you were once a die-hard 'meat and potatoes' person: you want more tantalizing, flavorful side dishes, you have dietary restrictions, you have vegan friends. Any of these reasons are good enough to start your journey, but you may find yourself appropriating more and more of these dishes as your entrees! (The only thing that kept me from rating it 5 Stars were the absence of pictures.)"
4,Recommended if you like..,It's a pretty good cd. Her voice sounds somewhat similar to bettie serveert. check out lamprey if you want a little more rocking-sound.
5,Hauntingly Lush and Intoxicating,Neko Case has a voice that is as warming as a shot of firewater on a cold winters night. And her songs have a bite to them that sneaks up on you.This album is a rather dark journey about lonliness and fear and yet comforting to listen to. Such an amazing album from an amazing songstress.I highly recommend this album.
4,A darker shade of brilliance.,"Another superb offering from a genuinely rare songwriter/vocal talent. Newcomers to Neko Case are advised to try the more up-beat' Furnance Room Lullaby' before this CD - unless you like your music dark, edgy and melancholy, in which case - dive on in here for songs to send shivers to your core. The vocals, musicianship and production maintain the standards of the rightfully-acclaimed F.R.L. Her fourth disc can't come soon enough - and oh, for a UK tour..."
2,"Good for DJ work perhaps, not for home/office use!","I bought these headphones because I'm an old-fashioned audio listener (headphones MUST BE really Headphones: cord tangling, extra weight on your head and heating ears included).I use to listen music while I'm on bed, either before falling asleep or very early on Saturday mornings. For this purpose, these headphones have been tough on falling from bed to bare floor (no rug under my bed); however when connected to a low impedance headphone input (I have a mini 3CD component aside my bed), they produce a very noticeable and annoying low-frequency noise. It is clearly heard in the usual 2-3 seconds gap between songs on CDs."
2,don't waste your money,this game is overrated and is not that good so don't waste your money instead buy metal gear solid subtsance
5,this game is sweet,"I got the demo of splinter cell in pc gamer (witch is a good pc magazine for games) and i can not stop playing it i have beaten it on normal and hard, I am so going to get this game the only problem is that it dosen't tell you all the moves that he can do like in the pc game how do you roll? It dosen't tell you! i love it that you can put guns to peoples heads although i want to be able to choke them to death! i mean come on! that kind of ... but oh well it's still a game that you should get but you need a good grafic card or else it will look bad. Anyway I spy on people outside and this is just like real life sept for when you die you can't come back to life just by loading the game back up ha ha ha download the demo if you don't beleve me. but i'm going to get the game."
5,Splinter Cell,"This game is awesome! I played the demo for Xbox and might be getting it for the PC. I didn't get to play long, but what I did play was GREAT! I went down some stairs... Jumped up and used the wall to stay up there... shot a guy and some lights... All in all, it's a GREAT GAME!"
1,Pathetic game,"All I can say, is that I'm glad I purchased this game at a bargain price. It's total crap. I dont know what game these people are playing, but its not Splinter Cell. Talk about false advertising.."
4,A Letter To God,"I read ""A Letter To God"" by Gregorio Lopez in my literature class. This is the second time i have read the story. I find it very amusing in the sense that it contains both drama and humor. It reminds me of some of the old folklore tales told within the hispanic community. I really liked this story."
1,"Good idea, bad product, bad customer service","It stopped working aroung 40 ~ 50 days. Terminal of this product is exposed, so static might have killed it. I don't mind as long as they can fix this item or exchange it for free but the company is not even responding to my e-mail. I sent 5 emails in 9 days and never got response from them.Novel product / good price but doesn't worth your money. Stay away."
4,1 Year later...,"I have this a little over a year and it's still going strong. I have rebuilt my HTPC twice since buying this sound card, so it's seen XP, Vista, and now Windows 7(all 32-bit). At first, I had some issues getting the DDL to work correctly in Vista and Win7. Then I found these drivers and everything worked great [...]The software interface is very different (kinda cheesy), but the functionality is there. All in all, I'm still happy with the card, especially for the price."
2,buy something else,"This book offers very little explanation of things that matter most. I got much better understanding of how astrology affects people's attitude from a local newspaper horoscope. Good thing was that this book was not expensive. If you are looking for something more thorough, find something else."
3,Expensive for only one towel,"It wasn't clear to me that this was only one towel, not a 4 pack. It's a nice enough towel, and the hood is cute, but too expensive for just one toddler towel."
5,Beautiful...just beautiful,"Fans of '( )' who want to share the haunting beauty that is Sigur Ros with friends should definitely expose them to this ep first. Why? Simply put the title track (which is also on their first album Agaetis Byrjun) is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. In fact it is the consensus of most Sigur Ros fans that this song is, to date, their crowning achievement. However, another reason to introduce people to this ep first is that it also includes two live tracks that really open up the ambience of the music in a way a studio produced piece just can't. I picked up this ep on a whim and once I heard the strains of that distorted, bowed, Les Paul, I knew this purchase had to have been divinely inspired. This is just gorgeous music!"
1,"""How to""....are you kidding me ?","It's obvious she's beautiful watercolorist, but, even to an intermediatepainter!!!???? Not a book I would have bought, if I'd seen it first hand."
3,WAY TOO HARD FOR A BEGINNER!!,MUCH TO MUCH HARD FOR A BEGINNER AND SHOULD UNDERSTAND A LOT TO BUY IT.
1,Not what I expected,"This doesn't have the typical wall calendar layout that I expected, so I'll be returning it shortly. Wish I had known ahead of time. This calendar has no pictures inside but instead lists the days of the month with lots of room for notes on each day. I'm sure this might meet the needs of some folks but just isn't what I was wanting."
3,different shower curtain,"this is a mostly adequate shower curtain. the ""hookless"" gimmick is ok as long as you handle the curtain VERY carefully otherwise it keeps coming off. I probably wouldn't bother with this type again."
3,True above,"Pay attention to what the music fan above has said, for it is absolutely true. This cd sounds too much like that annoying new age music that mentally-ill yoga lovers use to listen. Want to hear Mertens at his best? I suggest try with Maximizing the audience. It may be a hard work, for it is a minimalistic-in-extreme cd, but... is worthwhile, or perhaps Jardin Clos. That is my recommendation."
5,Healing After Loss,"this book got me out of bed many mornings after my husband died a few years ago. Since then I have given at least 10 copies to friends and family suffering from a loss. Without exception they have had the same experience. When you ask, after, a death, ""what can I do?"". Here is one answer."
5,This book is a Godsend since I lost my husband two years ago,"I was dealing with the devastation and loss of my husband after a fight with the evil cancer. I did not want to live. My whole life changed and I would have done anything to have him back. But, I kept living and I couldn't get him back no matter what. This book has had a profound affect in helping me deal with and get through this painful phase called grieving. The writings of 365 different people and days describes so effectively the feelings and reality of what grief is. I still read it daily. So many of the comparisons hit home. I have bought it for two friends who have recently lost loved ones. I highly recommend it to any grieving person who needs to understand the emotional and painful process they are going through. You aren't alone."
1,neither inspiring nor comforting for me,"A page a day consisting of a short quotation about grief (e.g. ""Even desolation is a world to be explored"" - one of the better ones actually) followed by a longer exposition on the quotation by Hickman and then a little summing up at the end (e.g. ""hurray for laughter - lead me to it""). A few of the quotations were thought provoking but on the whole it seemed to me to be 365 days of cliches."
4,well done bood of meditations,This book is designed to console people dealing with the death of someone dear to them. The short quotations and reflection provide a dose of consolation. Well done!
1,Another error she made,"I stumbled upon this book while browsing in a bookstore long ago. I imagined from the title that she was attempting to explain to the public Sir Andrew Wiles' great accomplishment in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, but when I started reading her book, I couldn't believe my eyes.In addition to the errors other reviewers have pointed out, she claims that non-Euclidean geometry is ""false."" I would send her my book on that subject but I doubt that she would read it.I say that because a mathematician I know sent her a polite letter pointing out her errors. She replied:""My mathematical friends and I had a good laugh over your missive. Keep those cards and letters coming.""Yes, she was smart enough to give the correct solution to the Monty Hall problem, but when she errs, she is either too arrogant or too ignorant or too corrupt to admit it."
1,Astonishingly inaccurate and arrogant,"I wish Amazon.com would give us the option of zero stars. This pamphlet demonstrates no understanding of the history or mathematics underpinning the proof of FLT. If vos Savant sought to give her readership the impression that she rubs shoulders with giants, she failed miserably. She is not a mathematician nor a literary genius nor anything else that she would have the unsuspecting, uncritical reader believe. I am relieved, however, that vos Savant was gracious enough to position her image in the lower right-hand corner of the pamphlet's cover. I just hope Fermat didn't mind.Kind reader, how could such drivel ever be published?"
1,Save your time and money,"The author claims this book was written in three weeks; it is difficult to believe they spent even that much time producing it.This book supposedly recounts the drama of Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. But this book only takes the reader up to the events of 1993, even though the story does not end there. An incredible story indeed, but not as told in this volume. A better account can be found in Singh's book, Fermat's Enigma."
5,Impressive for a Canon-compatible,"Having used both Canon and this Quantaray brand, I can say that Quantaray does do quite well in comparison. While I will admit the flash is rather 'bulky', it performed well in every test I could think of. I especially liked the ability to bounce-flash in many directons, no matter where I aimed the camera. Usually I bounce off a ceiling or wall, and the flash worked as it should.For the price, this flash is ideal for starters, but if you're a hobby-enthusiast or a semi-pro, I'd recommend you to the 580exII.Overall, every feature worked well, I had no problems, except it doesn't 'talk' to my Canon flashes and so I keep it as an emergency spare in the event my Canon fails and I need a flash urgently enough.My five star rating is justified, as it's a solid-built flash, nothing feels cheap, and everything works on it like it should."
5,Perfect description of Jersey City life in the past.,"I honestly don't know why so many reviews are negative about this book. It's an honest description of life, both good and bad, in was used to be one of America's ugliest and most corrupt cities. A true portrayal of growing up poor surrounded by an abandoned industrial wasteland at a time when petty theft was necessary for survival. The description of the main character's life is both hilarous and pathetic. If you remember the ""old"" Jersey City before all the luxury apartments and the creation of Liberty State Park from hundreds of acres of hideous railroad ruins, then this book is for you!"
2,Poor quality replacement,I looked this part up on sears parts direct first. The cost was $70 so I searched for an equivalent aftermarket part. When I found this one at $25 I was pretty happy. When I got the part I was disappointed to discover that the mounting holes didn't line up. Well get what you pay for I guess. I had to spend some time drilling through the stacked metal plates in order to get it to work. In the end it finally functioned OK but buyer beware on that point.
3,Disappointed,Doesn't look nearly as nice as it is represented in the photograph. Looks somewhat cheap.
1,As bad as a movie gets!!!,"Louis Malle did many great films! Zazie, Lacombe Lucien to name a few! What on Earth was he thinking when he made this piece of surrealist garbage?!? At that moment, he had reached his limit! I am only too happy that he gave it up and directed wonderful movies such as Au revoir les enfants and Atlantic City afterward! Watch before you buy!"
2,Mobile Bases,"I bought this base for use with my 15"" Delta Planer. This planer is heavy, but the stand is supposed be able to carry the load. It does not have near heavy enough steel on the plate where the swiveling wheel attaches. My stand's plate bent under the weight of the planer; resulting in a condition of a ""unmovable"" planer. I had to reinforce the plate with metal I had on hand. My repair works, but only good enough to get by. The product must have not been tested with a planer attached in real workshop conditions. I nearly always am satisfied with Delta products, this is the exception."
2,Its a joke,"What the hell, my two cats looked at it and then looked at me as if what have I given them!! They don't play with it at all. Moreover it was only 3$ in walmart."
1,Superb Rendition of a Dreadful Composition,"Neikrugs music should be left on his piano. This composition is weak in texture, tepid in its vision even though it's probably his best composition. He needs to stick to playing piano. This was a pain to listen to. I never made it to side 2. The first class musicianship of Pinchas Zukerman and Orchestra de Paris conductor and musician Christoph Eshenbach are totally wasted on this mess."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD! One you can just put in and push play from start to finish. Some Key songs are: Linda Lou, Mississippi Delta, This Time, and Southern Soul. I also recommend: I've never slept in the rain & Memory bound. Where has this band been?! This is just the right medicine for a sick music industry. I would love for the song ""Sparrow"" to be played at my Funeral or something. I mean it give me goosebumps every time I hear it. Lee's voice is a cross between Elvis and Hank Williams JR. ""Loved the Hell out of Me"" is a great song[*]. The Lyrics are Truly inspirational to each and every song. Great [CD!]"
1,Did not work with 3G 30 GB iPod,"Although there were no restrictions listed when I bought it (Amazon's description now specifies 3G and 4G models), this Maxell recorder failed to work with my 3G 30GB iPod. It did record sometimes, but the volume was so low down into the noise level as to be useless. No support or explanation from Maxell, so back it went. Too bad, because the price was right!"
3,decent recorder,"It's an overall good product for the price. I actually bought this for my boyfriend so he could record lectures at school. The microphone is not really good enough to do that. It would not be able to pick up sounds from very far away, but I think most recorders wouldn't. It's a cool product because after you record something, you can play it back without headphones. The device also provides a speaker! This would be a great product if you just wanted to use a recorder for personal memos."
3,handles are a bit light,"After owning a Buddy Lee Rope Master, I decided to upgrade to the aerospeed. You may not be able to tell, but the handles are actually hollow. The Rope master handles were ever so slightly weighted and gave some centrifugal assistance with the rotation of the rope. Because these handles are so light I am finding it necessary to rely on my arms more instead of my wrists. This relates to more effort. The bottom of the handles are open so I will probably try to fill the space so that I can get the proper weight. I do appreciate the shorter handles compared to the ropemaster."
5,Carefully consider the Length,"Nothing wrong with the wire. After conecting the wire to the T.V., however, I realized a longer one would have probably been better. Nice wire though."
3,Already Available As A Longer Set,"The contents of this is already available as part of Realizing The Power Of Now. It does say it on the cover of the CD, ""Excerpted from Realizing The Power of Now,"" but it should be stated online when sold on websites such as this one. I recommend bypassing this one and getting the longer version, which is excellent."
3,disappointing,I stretched to give three stars. The story was good.but no substance. Too much thought and not enough dialogue and same.thoughts over and over. I was bored and just.skipped parts. Too bad because I really liked the characters.
1,my review,The camera is too heavy and so is not so portable. More importantly however is the fact that the swivel screen feature that I was looking out for is not what I got. The range of motion is too limited for the purpose I had in mind.
4,Brazilian soul-funk rock from 1990,"This is the first solo album by Fernanda Abreu, who was previously in the Brazilian ""BRock"" band, Blitz, which broke up in the late 1980s. This album originally came out in 1990."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this a while ago. After 2 weeks of using it, the balls broke and I threw it in the trash. I would not recommend anyone to buy this, and if they really want body jewelry, they should spend a little more money for a better quality."
2,paper wasted sip book,"Author is really good but the way SIP described in the book is a kind of child-story , details on important parts of SIP and on unified services are skipped instead make-up parts are highlighted."
1,Box leaks,I got these as a gift for my husband. One of the boxes leaks from the seam. Very disappointed in this purchase.
3,too hard!,"k, i luv spongebob, i really do, so i thought that i'd luv this game, but reallly, it's not that great. it's too hard! it starts out alright, but after that, it's so hard! if you are really into gameboy games and you really like a challenge, you'll luv this game, but i like to take the easy way out, so it wasn't too great. but if you DO like a challenge, then what are you waiting for? buy it!"
3,too hard!,"k, i luv spongebob, i reallly do (just ask my classmates, lol) so i thought i'd luv this game, but really it's too hard! it starts out alright, but then it gets SO hard. but if you really like game boy games, and you really like a challenge, then you'll luv this game, but i like to take the easy way out so i didn't really like it. i'm only on like the 3rd level! but if you really like a challenge, then what are you waiting for? BUY IT!"
4,Soo cool,This game is OK. The first spongebob game for xbox was ok. It wasnt very exciting. And it was hard you whould get killed in the first level. Only experts can beat the first level and somene my age(12) and lower whould never be able to beat it. So the sponge bob game for gbc was horrible too you did nothing in that game seriously. So know i got the new spongebob game for gba. Still ok but hard to beat!~!~!~
3,Fun but Frustrating,"First off, as far as computer games go this one is pretty good. The graphics are excellent, the menu's are easy to use. But there are some serious kinks in this game. Left-hand batters no matter what their power, rarely hit homeruns. In dynasty mode, players retire for no reason, and many minor leaguers simply disappear. If you don't have one of the 3 or 4 supported gamepads/controllers yours won't work with this game, and using the keypad presents major difficulties, like not being able to lead off, slide, or swing and control runners at the same time. Despite these deficiencies the gameplay is excellent, the difficulty levels and dynasty mode provide great challenges, and their are fun bells and whistles which add to the fun. I would buy it, but don't expect perfection."
3,I may change this once I actually start playing...,"This game looks very sharp. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to play it yet because this game only supports FIVE controllers. Yes, that's right, 5. If you don't have one of the 5, you'll have to drop a few extra bones and pick one up if you plan on playing a live game.I myself don't have a problem with buying one, but I can imagine kids who want to play this that don't have a lot of money, they will be at a disadvantage.Hopefully this review will change."
2,Do NOT buy this game YET,"Im a veteran Computer Baseball game player.If you plan on playing MVP 2004 Online, DONT BUY IT, yet!BUGS BUGS BUGS!This game is know for having a critical bug that RESTARTS the game against an Online buddy if either STEAL OR TRY TO STEAL a base. As soon as you do the game restarts in Inning 1. UNNACCEPTABLE. Its even happened on occasions where no stealing was done.I also had to spend $30 on a new PAD which I SHOULDNT have because that is such a disrespectful thing for EA to do in not supporting most Gamepads out there and forciong us to spend to get to play.ALL in all this GAME GAS POTENTIAL but not until the many bugs are patched. Lets put it this way, if this was an Airplane it would crash on its first flight."
4,A delightful Confection of a Regency Romp,"Miss Lockharte's Letters is a delightful confection of humor, intrigue, and romance.When Miss Lockharte decides in a delirium to castigate those who snubbed her in her short unhappy life, she sets off a chain of improbable events including murder,espionage,and the discovery of true love.Leavening this serious mix with a dash of wit and absurdity, Barbara Metzger displays her skill at handling the intricate plots and deft characterizations. This is a perfect read for a hot summer day."
2,"Somewhat Helpful, but needs a new addition","Probably the most useful thing about this workbook is the CD. Listgening to it can help you pronounce better. Otherwise I found a lot of problems with this book. Firstly, they did not include all the hangul combinations. The only note the book contained is that some combinations were not there, because they were uncommon even though the textbook uses those. Secondly, it would've been helpful if they had printed the dialogues on the CD in the book. Unless you practice the writing on your own (which I did), the book is not very useful for teaching you how to write. Overall, the book was helpful, but this was because I was motivated more than anything that had to do with the book."
4,A good start,This book/CD combo is great for someone brand new to Korean and the Hangul alphabet. The presentation is fun and holds your interest. The romanization is helpful for people just getting their feet wet for the first time. Should be used in conjunction with other workbooks CDs etc.
2,"Great idea, glaring mistakes","The format of this book is fantastic- a fun and effective way to learn some basic Korean vocabulary!Unfortunately, there are some BASIC errors in the given pronunciations of Korean letters. If you just use this book, you will be mispronouncing some common, necessary letters.My recommendation: Get another book, CD, website, or friend to learn to pronounce Hangul. Then use this book to ease the drudgery of memorizing vocabulary, and have make a game of finding the mistakes in it!"
2,"Does what it says, but not very usefull.","This does exactly as the name suggests. It teaches you 100 words in korean. However, that is the only reason why I gave this book 2 stars. It is also glaring with problems.First, I will no longer buy any korean language book that gives romanized translations of words. Most of the time the roman version is wrong, and it attracts the eye. Instead of reading and practicing hangeul, I would find my eyes drawn to the incorrect roman versions.Second is a problem that I find with many language learning books (not just this book) is the choices of words. Most words like ""lion, mouse, monkey, bed, farm, etc."" are utterly useless for beginning to learn a language. These words will not be used enough to be useful when speaking to natives. They could easily and should have been switched with more common words. Sure, ""lion"" is an interesting for a child to learn. But I, and most people learning korean are not children and should not waste our time with these words."
4,Great Purchase,This is well worth the money. All of the examples demonstrate great licks you can add to your playing and you can even upload the cd into iTunes for easy access.
2,"""A So-So Novel""","This novel left me disappointed. Ms. Price-Thompson is an excellent storyteller, but I didn't like the dialect of ""Aunt Hattie"". Not all black people talk like that. ""Juanita"" and all the other characters were just plain boring."
1,Does not really help with pet odors.,"If it eliminates odors at all, the effect is minimal al least with pet odors. It is pretty but not functional."
2,a little too wordy,"This book does have a nice message/moral at the end. However, I thought it was a bit long especially for younger readers. I'm not sure anyone younger than 10 will understand the message. The pictures were a bit to abstract as well for younger children."
2,Let down,"I thought this movie sounded like just my kind of thing, but sadly I found myself very let down by it. The characters failed to really be all that interesting, the slap-stick comedy (people jumping out of windows) was just a bit too silly(and not funny) and I kept finding myself thinking that Penelope wasn't really all that ugly. It seemed a bit over-exaggerated that people were jumping out of a window at the mere sight of her - she wasn't that horrible to look at. The movie earned a few points for me with its ending--which didn't end how I had expected it to---but I must say that overall, this was forgettable and I wouldn't want to bother watching it again."
2,Stupid movie,"The directors must think we are all stupid. But in reality, they are. This movie makes sure to put inappropriate family dialogue (sexual) in the first 10 minutes, spoiling it for parents of children. We turned it off after we had had enough. I watched it later alone to see if we should let the kids watch it. It did get better with less sexual innuendos but the characters were Americans???? acting as Brits???? The whole thing was just stupid! So many of the characters acted like idiots.The only redeeming message was that like Dorothy, she had the power all along to change her face. She just needed to like herself the way she was.Don't waste your money on this."
4,Who said you had to be anyone else.,"Well Who did? This is a wonderful movie that I really enjoyed, and will enjoy for a long time to come."
4,Charming and Delightful,I love watching this movie! Ricci and McAvoy worked so well together and it was nice to see Witherspoon play a supporting role and a character different from her usual. This is a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy and one that teaches a great lesson: to love yourself as you are.
4,I actually first heard of the band........,"while playing need for speed for my ps2. so i went online and checked it out, and i'm glad i did. there are some great rock songs here with catchy choruses. My fav's are #2, #5, and #8. If your a fan of creed or nickle back or three doors down, check this one out."
4,Great Item For Organizing Gift Wrao Stuff,"Item shipped extremely fast ~ Great item for organizing gift wrap stuff (which was what I purchased it for) ~ would be even better if it could hold more than 1 roll of gift wrap on each side in their respective pouches. Other than that, a great product!"
2,Not As Advertised.,"Buyer beware. When I finally received this via the mail, it was jammed into a mail slot and appeared much smaller than it does in the picture. It is very cheaply made and the reinforcements you see on the middle pouches (the white strips on the openings) are not present. I will be inquiring about a full refund for this item."
5,BL1 much better than UT5,Extremely frustrated with the UT5 kit in which I bought twice with no luck. This one is much much much easier to build for running relay or producing TTL logic.
3,"solid basic thermostat by honeywell, but for a few bucks more available programable version","This is a great basic model thermostat by honeywell. It has a nice clear easy to read display and simple controlls and adjustments. great to replace those old dial or slide thermostats. Great for the workshop. But, in my home, i have the programable version of this thermostat, looks identical to this, and simple to use, and it only cost around $10 more on average than this model."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"Although I always make my own guacamole, I was in a hurry one time and saw this in the produce section so I thought I'd try it because I really like Chef Bayless and I thought it would save me some time. I read the ingredients and everything looked great. Although i don't normally add tomatillos, I thought why not because I generally like tomatillos in other things. I mixed this with the avocados as instructed, tasted, and it just wasn't very good. It lacked flavor; especially the flavors one normally tastes in traditional guacamole: garlic, tomatoes, onion, and lime, to name a few. It should be noted that some of these are listed in the ingredients list on this bottle.I ended up chopping up my own tomatoes, garlic, and onion, and basically everything else I normally do when making guacamole to ""fix"" the guac. It actually took longer than if I had just made the guac like I normally do."
3,The Truth,"The truth is that this book is, while not bad, surely not as good as Murdoch can be. Of course, she was a victim of Alzheimer's, and this was was her last book. But it is important to warn readers to do a deep reading of the literary criticism given to the book. Critics, obviously aware of Murdoch's illness, wanted to be kind - she is a powerhouse of a genius after all. But the book, while engaging, takes a long time to become truly absorbing, and even then, the story's inconsistencies remain and are impossible to ignore. Nonetheless, Jackson's Dilemma is a good read, and I do genuinely appreciate it."
2,Avoid a dilemma: read other Murdoch novels before Jackson's,"To be fair to Iris Murdoch, I suggest that a first-time Murdoch reader avoid choosing Jackson's Dilemma for a first exposure to Murdoch. Not knowing that this was her last novel I began my Murdoch adventure at a disadvantage. Although I found the novel interesting it was definitely unsatisfying because her concept of Jackson was not well enough developed. In light of recent research regarding the effect of Alzheimers Disease on her writing, I'll certainly read some of her earlier novels."
3,A Day's Pleasure: the opening sequence is a gem,"A Day's Pleasure:Although Chaplin hadn't yet perfected his cinematic timing and pacing, that doesn't detract much from the joys of this Chaplin short. A few sequences go on a bit long but the opening sequence in particular is a gem.Haven't seen the other shorts yet."
4,shower curtain,"Very good description of product, matching the item. Correct arrival time and well packagedThanks"
2,has all the potential to be a good show but..,lack of character development and the appearance of intrigue without any plot to support leaves this show coming up short. The high school level romance adds nothing to the show.
2,Slow and boring....,"No wonder it didn't get renewed for a second season. The two main characters are handsome and beautiful, but that's all this series offers. The stories are slow and boring, and there is endless talk."
2,Too much talk,I thought this was going to have more in depth autopsy action. It has a lot of footage of the pathologists. A better title would have been PATHOLOGISTS TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK AND SHARE THEIR FAMILY PHOTOS. Bfirst time I'm disappointed in an Amazon purchase.
4,Innovative vegetarian,"This is one of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks, mainly because it is creative. I get tired of the same-old standard cook-the-tofu recipes, but this one has some unique combinations and great tastes. Some of the recipes are too time-consuming for me which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
3,Good Stuff,The book is easy to read and follow. I am a non cooking bachlor interested in feeding myself a more healthy diet and this book has been a great help. I actually enjoyed prepairing and consuming this stuff.
4,Fascinating combination of autobiography and travelogue.,"Despite the tantalising title, I wouldn't have guessed how fascinating this book would be, even thought I've read some of Diski's excellent novels in the past. The author embarks upon a voyage to Antartica which turns out to be a journey into her own personal history. What could have been an painfully honest and difficult autobiography to read, the reading of this book is tempered by the delightful travel observations of someone who would have been happier staying in her own armchair at home. Although this sounds like a ""women's"" book, I am definately not of that gender, and truly enjoyed every chapter."
4,Great price for product. Shipping expensive,"This was a great price on the shampoo and conditioner. I have 4 dogs so I need a lot and I love this particular shampoo/conditioner. The product is great. However, once you pay for shipping, you may as well have bought it in the store. You pay as much in shipping as you do for one of the gallon bottles."
2,Pretty sweet,"The style is really nice. I didn't think i'd like all the frost that's on it, but it's nice to keep the fingerprints off. The Mikasa symbol is printed and not stamped or etched so it rubs off. I've lost one of the logos a spoon already, i've owned the set for about a month. I also bent on of the big spoons on some ice cream. I can't image an oneida being any better.Heavy set, good for the price, minor problems. Oh, some of the pieces are scratched from washing as well, they don't keep the luster."
5,Learn from the best,This is the best book I've read on golf instruction. If you're going to learn why not learn from the best.
4,Interesting and Informative.,"I liked some of the information on golf technique. It has worked for Annika for hitting shots straighter and further. However, Annika does admit that she could not hit the ball no where nearly as far as she does now compared when she first joined the tour. This is partially do to her weightlifting program.I found the following to be a great golf instruction book that cut my handicap in half. This book is "" The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better"" (isbn---1933023090).This last book showed me the essetials of the zero handicap or better golf swing. This book shows you how to become a zero handicap golfer. Also, it has proven tips that work for the short game which helped me to get up and down much more often. As for Annika's book it is a good book to learn the basics on golf."
5,This is good,"This dvd has all the pixies videos, a live concert (with great video and sound quality), a british documentary about the band and some home movies of them on tour around 1989. I am really happy I got this dvd. A must for any Pixies fan."
2,"Puzzle fell to pieces, so to speak","We love the Melissa and Doug toys and have bought many. We generally find them to be of good quality construction and durable, as well as engaging and educational.However, we purchased this and the Africa Plains 24 piece puzzle for our grandson for Christmas. When we removed the shrink wrap and started to separate the pieces, the bottom and top laminate layers on the edges of several pieces immediately peeled and/or snapped off. (One of our grandkids puts everything in her mouth and I could see these puzzle pieces causing a hazard if she picked one up.)We really like the Melissa and Doug toys and have had great experiences with most of them. I'm hoping that this problem is just a fluke with a bad batch of glue; but this happened with 2 different puzzles. I've emailed them to ask them to investigate."
1,Does not meet expectations,"I purchased this for my 3-year old. This puzzle does not meet my expectations. The pieces were not cut well so they were difficult to take apart and put together. Also, there were pieces of wood falling off the pieces when we took the puzzle apart."
1,"Wow, such a deal!!!","I bought my dvd-r120 at best buy after christmaws. It was an open box deal for 150$. I have had no problem whatsoever with it. I like the component video picture, and have had no problems with playing the discs made on it on my Pioneer dvd player on my main system. People complain that it is picky about what discs it plays, but I have been using dvd-r from Verbatim (which I don't believe is even on the list in the manual) with nothing but good results. Only thing I would add is easy ability to add chapter points manually, but this is no big deal. With the thumbnails it creates, you can find stuff very easily. Was thinking about getting a vcr/dvd recorder combo unit, but I believe these units have more ways to break, rather then one component per box. Would recommend to anyone."
1,Piece of garbage,"Machine didn't work out of the box and Samsung charged $40 to fix it b/c it was built before a certain date (?). Got it back and it still didn't work. No ""fixes"" have worked and Samsung's tech support has wasted countless hours of our time upgrading firmware, buying additional DVDs, shipping the unit back and forth twice. Do not waste your time with this POG."
2,Disappointing and Broken,"Everything started out fine, but within 3 weeks my machine was unusable. Recording was easy from my camcorder, though I never got it to work with my VCR; playback has been a nightmare - progressively over the last 2 weeks my machine has been getting worse and worse: freezing and skipping are the primairy problems with, now, such frequency, I can't watch anything. I've tried different DVD's and to no avail. I've tried cleaning, to no avail. I'm just returning my machine to Amazon, hopefully for a refund so I can choose another manufacturer. If you plan on using this only for recording from you camcorder- this is the machine for you. Otherwize pick another unit."
2,Check your version,Do not buy this if it is the AXAA version. It's defective. No DVDs made on this recorder will play on other players. The XAA version works fine though.
2,2006 calendar is off by a day!!!,"I recently bought one and found out immediately that I could not set the date completely. You can set the day, month, year and time, but not the day of the week. It seems there is an internal calendar on this unit and it is behind by a day for 2006. 2005 was fine and I set a future date in 2007 and that was fine. This makes useless the settings like ""MON-FRI"" and ""SAT-SUN"", while ""EVERY-$DAY"" can be adjusted by one day off but you still have to remember that.As someone else mentioned, the audio/video sync is sometimes off as well.A plus is that this unit is very easy to use and I like its menu system but the two problems after only a week means that I am returning the unit and going for the Toshiba R4."
2,mediocre performance,"1. Hook-up was easy.2. Recorded image quality is poor.3. Speed is OK.4. Had a green line at the bottom of screen - scan line?- that was recording on DVD independent of settings, type of input, source, etc.5. I have a Samsung VCR multisystem and DVD player and they're both OK. The DVD recorder is less than average.I had to return it and bought the Panasonic ES20"
1,cheap and poorly made,"I have had this recorder less than six monthsand used this dvd it less than 50 times, and now get an error message almost every time I try to record on it. I would not waste my money on this unit."
3,Change name to Potato Vegetable soup,"Was an okay soup, but now very chciken only had 1 1/2 "" sq piece of chicken. Had more potatoes than anything, then barley, corn, little tomato, little english pea, little green butter beans rest broth. coup 2/5's broth."
2,no good,i liked them using real porn stars but i didn't like the film at all... not even close to what i had expected of it... i don't recommend this
3,Split Decision,"My mother owned a cuisinart dome-style stainless electric kettle. Then one day a guest of hers put it on the stove, not noticing the plastic base--goodbye kettle. But we loved it, so we bought one, 'til one day a guest of ours put it on the stove.... So clearly they look too much like the real thing. For a replacement I decided on this Breville after reading the reviews. I love it, my wife hates it, so guess what... it's going back. Yes, this thing gets dangerously hot, blistering hot all over its surface. I scoffed at reviewers who said heat was a problem, until we used it! For some reason this gets much hotter than the cuisinart we had. This doesn't bother me, I think it works great, is well designed and good-looking, but it's going back for the Cuisinart, this time the coffee-pot shaped model that looks like this Breville."
4,My 2yr old grandson loves these.,"I thought these may be too small for my grandson, but his parents thought they would be ok. He loves them, knows all the names now, and loves to select all the same types, there are 5 of each, and he spends a lot of time with them. Some 2 yr olds may not be old enough for these, but his attraction to animals keeps him from putting them in his mouth."
5,Excellent recipes for ALL kinds of game.,"Where else can you find recipes for Canadian Lynx Stew and Sauteed Salmon Steaks in the same place. Or, how about Sea Cucumber Fritters or Spruce Grouse with Blueberries. This cookbook is a mixture of ""normal"" and exotic recipes for ALL fish, shellfish, game, game birds, and edible plants that are available in Alaska. All of the recipes are excellent and most are entertaining just to read."
5,"Solid Performance - Picture, Sound & HDCD A Plus","Interesting that the 'professional' review wasn't that favorable. I find the picture quality is excellent, and the sound excellent as well. One plus that hasn't been dwelled on is the ability to play HDCD. High Definition (music) CD's have been encoded in a 20 bit format vs. 16 bits for 'regular' CDs. A lot of the newest CD's are recorded in 20 bit format, but are also downward compatible with the old 16 bit standard. The difference in sound quality is very noticeable, even to a non-audiophile. Go to hdcd.com for details. All in all this is a solid, well made item. It even says Good bye! when you power it off. Go buy one ..."
4,Fascinating book,"I bought this book for the interesting title and to my great surprise it is a very interesting read. I have read many books on the ""mountain men"" and trail riders but the women in song, movie and story are left following behind. This book give an interesting description of what it was really like the good, the bad and the ugly. It has some very nice photos and pictures of the native women and well indexed and footnoted.This book is probably more of a ""girl"" read but anyone who loves western history will find it interesting and the names there..what the personal life of the westward man was."
5,FlowFit,"This DVD was very easy to watch and understand, the music added synergy. The instructions clear and demonstrations simple. The dialogue very easy to listen to and calming which complements the exercise. The teachers method of instruction is great. The routines were stepped well from easy to more challenging, a fantastic way to strengthen your mind and body."
4,could of been a top game,"pros -GREAT WEAPONRYGOT TO USE YOUR BRAIN INSTEAD OF ATTACKING STRAIGHT ONGREAT CAMARA EFFECTS WHEN CLIMBING LADDERS AND DOING SWITCHScons -NO IN-GAME SAVE DATA - THATS MEANS U DIE, U RESTART LEVEL :(DIE TOO MANY TIMES - LOADS OF CHEAP SHOTS U WOULD EXPECT FROM A WELL-EXPERIENCE GAMER WHO MASTERED FPS GAMESLOSE THE WEAPONS WHEN U GO ON NEXT LEVELoverall its a good game with a few cons which could of been sorted, the terrian is a tad bad, you could walk into the mountains for like 30mins, u turn round, and you gotta walk 30mins back to where u was. Sniping is good, also u can shoot someone and hide, and the AI dont even know where u are ;)U got to be careful when comeing down mountains, 1 slip and your back is broken and then its back to the start of the level ;)NO multiplayer :( big shame, not even a patch for multiplayer :(4 out of 5 - could of been better, only the 4 stars for great weapons and their graphics"
2,who want's stealth crap?,"now i am used to be playing unreal tournament and those type of games are my favorite. this is no walk into a room and start shooting. u have to use so much stealth it takes the fun out of the game right there. it is so hard i cant stand it. it gets you very frusturated at times and i have to stop my self form throwing the stupid game out of my window. i mean when you shoot the gun slides up which makes it impossible to kill a sniper. the graphics are great i mean, but the game isnt even fun. i really tried hard to like it but i dont think i will ever like it. i gave it 2 stars only because i really try hard to think about the positive sides fo games and thought about it awsome graphics. so unless your a person who like these kida games, go for games like unreal tournament, quake 3 or no one lives forever is a fun first person shooter which has a little stealth in it which is fine."
2,A little disappointed in Wammo,"Wammo has some great CDs, and there is no such thing as a bad Asylum Street Spanker cd (wammo's full time job). This disc just sounds like he is goofing around with a 4-track recorder. The title track is a mash-up of low rider and riders on the storm. It's mildly funny but gets boring after a couple minutes. The version of ""beer"" is nowhere near as good as the Spankers version. Wammo is awesome, but this isn't a good representation of his talents. Hardcore fans will appreciate parts of it, but newbies would hate this disc."
2,Better than nothing if your bottles are falling over,"This product helps, but it is not very stiff and the white color means you can't see through to the next shelf. The material curls strongly because it comes it a roll. The ""clips"" don't help much in holding it down. On the plus side, it is easy to install.I installed the roll that I bought and it helped stop bottles from tipping over. But I would not buy this again."
5,Muffin lover's gem,"I love this thing! Now I can have a warm muffin whenever I want. Mix up a batch, make the muffins you want, and store any left over batter in the fridge for the next time. Fast and easy to use. Indicator light changes to green when ready to use. It will be ready by the time you have the batter ready to go. Muffins bake in 5-10 minutes. To get the bake time you want, stand by at 5 minutes and peek every minute until muffins are golden brown. After that just set your timer. Easy clean up with wet cloth while still warm. If you forget to clean up while its still warm, it's still a breeze. I wipe out the cups with a paper towel then a wet cloth. This is great for 1 or 2 people who don't have a lot of time for breakfast. Also great for snacks. Did I mention I love this thing?"
5,Unbelievable!,"I purchased a Muffin Magic after reading all the glowing customer reviews of the product. Could this be for real? Yes! I use the prepackaged muffin mix from the store (at about 69 cents a package), and get 3 of the prettiest and tastiest muffins I've ever made, and all of this in under 15 minutes. If you're skeptical that the Muffin magic might be too-good-to-be-true, think again. Buy one for yourself, and buy one for a friend. It's one of the coolest gadgets in my kitchen, and you'll think so, too."
3,Not worth the cost and space it takes up,"I guess I'm just not as crazy about this muffin baker as these other folks. I got it at a great price, so figured, what the heck? But I don't find that it cooks the muffins as nicely as in the oven, the bottoms tend to be rather hard and I find the muffin comes out ""denser"" if you will than normally. But mostly, I think it's just a waste of another kitchen appliance that doesn't serve a heck of a lot of purpose. It's just not versatile enough for me and it's bigger than it looks in the picture! Quite large when you compare to the size of say, a 6-muffin tin. I suppose it will save on having to start your oven, and the muffins do cook faster and cleanup is quicker. I guess I just don't find the regular method all that much a hassle!"
4,Makes great muffins in only 10 minutes,"Regular types of batter, like a box of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix, work great. But, when I tried to make a heavier type of batter(carrot muffins), the muffins did not cook all the way through before becoming too well done on the outside. Even so, I would still recommend this product for its simplicity and convenience."
1,Book IV: Song Bird Patterns by William Veasey,It was suggested that I might want to consider ordering this book when I was considering ordering a specific song bird carving book. Always on the lookout for resource materials I decided to order it based mostly on the picture on the cover and the title. It would have been nice if I could have viewed a couple pages in the book. Had I done that I would certainly not have ordered it. This is a very basic book that is quite outdated in terms of being an accurate source to go to for good representations of the bird patterns and the appearance of the specie. I think the patterns would be difficult to use.
3,Fun but not for long,My conure looked at this thing for a day and then went to work on it. By the next day it was all gone....a pile of wood chips at the bottom of his cage. It is safe but I would like something which would challenge and keep him busy for a longer time.I am still looking for that.
4,"Well, My Pet Cockatiel Cheech Likes It","It took him a while to warm up to it, but my very spoiled cockatiel, Cheech, enjoys chewing on it from time to time."
1,Stay with reading the book,"First of all, the book is one of the best I have ever read. The game seems like it would be great for families with children, especially with the simplicity of the scenarios, tours of the locations, and the lack of violence. However, the scaled-down plot, lack of character development, and the simplicity of problem-solving scenarios accompanied by an annoying sidekick who gives the solutions anyway, combine to make it a somewhat frustrating experience for the few hours it takes to finish it. I won't describe myself as a ""gamer,"" but I would assume that someone who is would also be frustrated by the game's simplicity, especially given the depth and complexity of the amazing book. I recommend the book to anyone and, if someone is a gamer, recommend other games (many by Eidos) that have richer plots with more challenging scenarios."
3,Too Much Edited Out!,"Loved the Book,have & read many times- which is very good. The PC Game got into the general frame of the story, but,,, some key elements of the book were cut out for the sake of time saving? - a Good game is at least six dedicated hours - interesting & fun, but not enough of it for a clever game play. In the book, at least one person is dispatched every several pages, in the game it's the exact opposite- none at all... non-existant strategy scenario-lite entertainment."
1,The shortest game I ever played,"I bought and installed this game on Saturday. I started playing on Sunday and finished it after playing for about 1 1/2 hour!! (this is no joke). I want to point out that I'm only a casual PC gamer and that I am not very talented. This is no real game, it's nothing more than an interactive screensaver (with very nice graphics). I don't know the book yet. Perhaps it's the only thing in this box with lasting value. Everyone who likes good adventure games should buy ""The longest journey"" (which keeps what the title promises)."
4,"It did a great job, cleaning is a bit complicated","Just tried this tonight on an experimental recipe of chicken, cashews and broccoli. It worked very well, with even cooking and effective temperature control. Very easy to use. The clean up is a bit awkward as you have to unscrew the wok from the base, so you have to wait for it to cool and by that time food has dried to the surface. But the non-stick coating worked well and (although it is dishwasher safe) it was an easy clean-up in the sink."
5,Great Wok,I had this Wok before my last deployment in 2005. I just got back from Iraq for my second tour a few days ago. I went to the PX to get this Wok but they didn't have any for sale. So i'm ordering a new one off Amazon. I would have the old one but we left early for the Surge. This Wok is the only one I have every brought and it is amazing. I made so much food in here that wasn't even stir fry. I have even used the wok to help me make Spaghetti.
5,The Only Perfect Wok,"I've owned several woks over several years, and they were all disappointing. Real Asian woks sit inside the heat source built into the stove and create heat on all the surfaces of the wok. That is, of course, impossible if the wok sits on top of a burner. This is the real thing, creating a perfect heat source for any recipe and providing an amazing ""sear"" temperature. I wish I had found this years ago, and will never own anything else. The non-stick coating is very durable- just be careful to use wood implements, and clean with a damp washcloth - and I have never had to remove the bowl from the base to clean it.On another note, the Breville company is a joy to work with. I had a small issue that I called them about (the cord was fitting too firmly inside the base) and they insisted on sending a whole new wok at their expense, 4 months after purchase. They were very kind and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this product and company."
2,Inaccurate Advertising.,"I ordered this toaster, received it in the mail, and had only to look briefly at the manual to know that I needed to return it. The Amazon web site states that it toasts four slices ""independently,"" and that's exactly what I wanted. But that's not exactly a feature of this appliance. Slices 3 and 4 must be toasted with 1 and 2. There is one knob for browning control for all 4 slots, not one for each 2 slots (like my old Hamilton Beach toaster.) With this machine, I can't put a split bagel in two slots, then bread in the others. I can't put 4 slices of anything in, and get them done 2 different ways. That's not what I call ""independent."""
1,What facts?,"Being a 32 degree Past Master, I've studied everthing I can find on our Masonic history. I'm disappointed that the author claims Freemasonry was never political when she obviously never read any of the Revolutionary American Lodges minutes. Had she done so she would have realized that many parts of our first war were planned in Lodges. If the Boston Tea Party wasn't poltical what was it?Also, while there is still question of the ties between the Templars and Freemasonry, there are plenty of documents in stone at the Roslyn Chapel in Scotland that does tie the two. Case in point, the templar initiation carving. This chapel was erected in the first half of the fifteenth century."
2,Maybe not even worth a rental...,"I'm usually open to anime but this movie just plain, for lack of a better word, [stinks]. I will admit that before this movie I have never watched the Patlabor series or movies before. I thought there would be a lot of mecha action but there was just about 5-10 mins of it. It was so boring in the beginning but I gave it a chance because that's how Gasaraki started and I loved that series after watching it past the first few boring chapters. I can dare say that this movie isn't even for die hard Patlabor fans."
5,Best for the price,I like the design of Samsung DVD-HD850 Up converter DVD.It can forward a DVD up to 64X speed.Its High Definition quality is good.Haven't had a problem yet.Best price for what it can do.
3,Dungeon Master in Orbit,"When I was buying this game, I kept on thinking of how my copy of the Sims was gathering dust on my shelf. I'd played the demo of Startopia and thought that it was a very humerous, immersive experience. Although there's a heck of a lot going on during gameplay, I get the overall feeling of not really being involved in the whole party. Sure, all the structures and decor has been provided by me, but terrorists plant bombs, electrical blackouts occur and aliens die randomly regardless of how much security, energy or medical resources I buy. Even though you can 'possess' aliens a la Dungeon Master (although it's called shoulder cam), you can't then take control of him and go where you want. Instead, you just get to walk around in circles.Anyway, a great looking game, albeit a bit buggy, but when the push comes to the shove, I'd imagine that it has a fortnight's appeal (I bought it yesterday after two days worth of demo playing, and I was getting tired of it after a few hours.)"
2,Slightly Misleading on Quantity,"Well, I haven't even tasted them yet, so the jury's still out on quality.. . . but when I opened the box I realized I'd not done a good job of shopping, because I'd allowed myself to be misled on the SIZE of the bars!!In browsing sugar free chocolates on Amazon, I chose this product in substantial part on price - 24 bars for $40. Curiously enough THE WEIGHT PER BAR IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE AMAZON SITE!! So, caution: MOST other sugar free bars are in the 3 - 4 oz range, and cost about twice (or more) per bar as this product; HOWEVER, THESE BARS ARE ONLY 1.2 oz each, so the unit cost ($/oz) is not at all favorable."
3,A bit disapointing.,"I have to give at least 3 stars first of because this is a lesbian love story and there are not enough of those around. From the director of ""I Can't Even Think Straight."" comes a dramatic love story set in South Africa. ""I Can't Even Think Straight."" is an adorable movie I can watch over and over again. Naturally I thought this one would be heart warming/wrenching and fun. Unfortunately it was just ok. A bit boring and lacking the sweetness of its predessesor."
2,Fried Green Tomatoes Rehashed and Badly,"It is a rehash of Fried Green Tomatoes, just set in another country. At times, disjointed and accents difficult to understand."
3,"""I Can't Think Straight"" is better","Watching ""I Can't Think Straight"" (by the same director), I thought this movie would be as enjoyable. Considering the place and time the movie was set in, and the plot, I can understand why there wasn't more intimacy between the lovers but it would have been nice! Still lovely to see these two women together- chemistry is good. The movie helped me understand more about apartheid. If you haven't see I Can't Think Straight - buy that one!"
5,hip hop is not dead,"Whell, I'm italian and I realy love true hip hop (mostly from the golden era), this one, in my poor opinion, is the best hip-hop album coming out from 2006 (maybe from the new millenium)... if u are loockin for some hip hop whit intelligent contents this one is for u... the productions are pretty cool and the lyrics are great... real f*cking life is not only beaches and money (for us), f*ck mtv and the s*it they plaingtake it, u can't desagree"
5,Stunningly beautiful music and lyrics,"Never heard of this work until recently. Each of the voices is just about perfect for each different part. Extremely sober subject matter, but so imaginative in concept and presentation. If ""Death of a Salesman"" can run on Broadway time and time again (as it should), then so should Caroline, or Change!"
5,Amber's Third Album - more than just club dance,"Amber combines trance, dance, pop, soul, and styles that are her own - and this shows more than ever in this album. Dance fans won't be disappointed with ""Yes"" and the ""Need to be Naked"" as well as most other tracks.But Amber has always also sung with a soul-filled power - in fact some of my friends can always thought she was a black singer! Attitude filled and energy giving vocals like these really make this more than just a dance album.Finally, Amber is also a great songwriter, at least cowriting most all her material. Her song ""Love One Another"" as covered by Cher has been nominated for a Grammy! Her writing skills also make this album more than just a ""dance album.""If you are looking for strictly a club dance sound, you will probably be a little let down - she also has a mainstream popular feel. But if you are looking for a pop album, you will also be let down - this album is somewhere in between, and something only Amber's style."
5,He'd make a great surgeon general,"I read this a couple months ago when Howard Dean was still the man with the nomination to lose. I think it's too bad he did lose it, because, as this book attests, warts and all, he would have been a very exciting president.My hope now is that John Kerry, if elected, has the vision to appoint Howard Dean surgeon general. That would be a huge step in a helpful direction for our country."
5,Howard Dean can write?,"I dint kno dat. I worked in Governor Dean's office as the sole black man on the fourth floor that he referred to during his exchange with Rev. Sharpton. That man can barely read. I had to go to his house at 10:00pm every night and read his children their bedtime stories, because their daddy couldn't read! Imagine that! I'm black too! And I can read! Thanks, LBJ!Oh, by the way, I wrote this book. (Hence, I gave myself five stars! That's one more than my all-white teachers in elementary school were willing to give a man like me!)Anyway, once, during a meeting, I referred to ""QWERTY."" Howard Dean told me to stop speaking in Swahili, because Vermont is a 100% English state. Okay, back to my hamburger fries.We're going to DC!"
3,High expectations were shattered!!,"I think I may be missing something here...after reading all the good reviews, I tried this blender and was disappointed. It looks good, great actually. Blender container is a great size. BUT...I found speed level one to be too weak and speed level two to be too strong! I was merely pureeing cottage cheese and an egg together and it splattered all over the container and lid, rather than emusifying in the bottom of the container. (You lose a lot of your mixture when you're trying to scrape it out of the sides and lid of the container.) I tried two different methods and the results were the same. I think I will keep on walking and try some others."
5,Wonderful Blender,"We use this blender just about daily--I make protein shakes; my wife blends various spreads and dips. It works wonderfully both at grinding ice and for blending. The unique six blade system crushes ice in no time flat. The vortex system of the jar allows for excellent blending from top to bottom. A knowledgable chef had told me to look for a blender with a vortex jar, and this was one of the few that I found. This blender works much better than the KitchenAid that it replaces both for blending and ice grinding. I also prefer the three speeds to the two speeds offered by the Oster and Waring blenders. Seemingly well-built and durable. This Breville is highly recommend."
4,The Shadow Saga is made for Hollywood!,"Golden is a golden writer. This series is one of the most exciting, fresh ideas in vampire mythos I've read in a while.Part fantasy, part horror, all explosive and action-packed, Golden weaves a richly drawn tale full of awesome characters of good and evil.Hollywood really needs to take a good, hard look at this one.Actually, the 4th book following this, is the best.His newest Menagerie Book # 1 is magnificent. Check it out."
3,At least it is the full show...,"I don't know where to start. It's a great ""historical"" concert that spans TD's long history 1973-2005. But it does have some flaws; the package states it has 5.1 sound, but I only found a normal stereo track. The phaedra '05 performance is awfully glitchy and makes me think it was used just to test their wavs. The other performances are OK, with some new percussion arrangements (mainly thanks to Iris, I must admit), but they do sound a lot like their studio counterparts. Did they program all their digital equipment to sound like that? Or did they just pop in some ""remastered"" wav files into their laptops? I don't know, and I fear the answer to that might be a little too disappointing for a band like Tangerine Dream.Anyway, this dvd was entertaining to watch, albeit a little long with all that 90's - 00's generic sounding stuff from the second half..."
2,DISAPOINTED,I was interested in these bras-this bra line after seeing on tv. I recieved and even though they are for the most part comfortable and breath...they do not have enough modesty coverage in the lining of the cup at all. Larger chest sizes need to have extra lining because it also helps with support. So I am not happy as I hoped to be by this product. But I give two stars because they are made very very well...just not enough support for me.
4,A must read to detox your life.,"Most of us take our homes and our environment within our homes for granted, when in reality, the polutants found in most homes may be adversely affecting the health of many of us. This book offers a lot of great information on how to rid our homes of the offenders and replace them with products that are safer and as a bonus, much less expensive.It was almost too much information and didn't get into enough directions on individual uses while offering way too many choices. However, the basics were there and getting a start with many of the cleansers is easy.Ridding our homes of environmental toxins is extremely important and this book helped me out tremendously.Andrew Keith, author of, Aging Is NOT An Option!"
2,Nasty and squishy!,"This stuff is not good, it's taste is terrible and the potatoes are of a very strange consistancy."
2,Doesn't work,"After reading all the reviews, I ordered this for our dog with FCE, who is unable to get up on the couch with a pretty lame left rear leg. We tried several times, and she fell off once. we'll be sending it back."
5,Great!,These steps are lightweight but sturdy and easy to put together. I also bought the 3 step version so that my dog could get into my bed at night. My mini schnauzer had a mild problem with his back so I got these to help him recover and they worked just great! It was very easy to train him to use them. Well worth the price.
4,Delicious Treat,This tart shell is one of my favorites. The shell is very sturdy and doesn't break easily. It has sweet buttery texture and taste that has a melt in your mouth sensation.
2,not so spreadable knives,"I bought these because I wanted a nice spreading knife that spread better than a regular, cutlery set knife. These actually spread worse than my regular meal knives. They look nice, but don't really spread well."
3,Bland and uninteresting pasta sauce,"Classico pasta sauces are my favorite at the supermarket, but this particular variety is a miss. I like my sauces to be chunky and full of flavor. This one is neither. I can't taste the ""fire roasted"" flavor in the tomatoes or the garlic. It's pretty bland as far as pasta sauce goes, tasting barely better than tomato puree out of a can. There isn't much flavor to this sauce at all, except the tanginess of the tomatoes. I had to add some red pepper flakes and black pepper to try to perk up my rigatoni.On the plus side this sauce, like all of Classico's, is all-natural and free of artificial additives. It is low in calories: 50 calories per 1/2 cup serving (10 from fat) and 400mg of sodium (17% recommended daily intake). It comes in a nice and thick glass jar that I re-use for storing spices and other food.I won't be buying this flavor again. I recommend Classico Traditional Favorites - Pasta Sauce Italian Sausage with Peppers & Onion- 24 oz instead."
5,Comfort & Great Price,"I have foot problems and these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn! I would recommend a half size larger but other than that, they are perfect. I can walk on stones and you can't feel them through the sole. I scuff them daily working with small children and they clean up so well, they look brand new. I love them so much, I bought two new pair that are sitting in my closet waiting to be worn when this first pair wears out."
4,Nice taste,"Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from ""Sports"" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake."
3,Contains 20% soy,"This used to be my favorite whey protein because the product name described exactly what it was: pure whey protein concentrate with no fillers, flavors, preservatives, etc. After reading a few reviews online claiming that the product contained soy, I contacted Bob's Red Mill directly. They confirmed that not only does the product contain a sprinkling of soy lecithin to prevent caking, but it actually contains 20% soy and 80% whey. I'm disappointed in this change and will not buy the product again until all the soy is removed. There are a couple of companies now producing raw organic 100% whey powders available over the internet."
3,Grainy,It is fine in smoothies where you can hide the texture. Otherwise the flavor is non-intrusive so it works fine for my purposes.
2,"Interesting, but rather too original","Most scientests doubt that Protoavis could be a bird, and many of them suspect that the Protoavis skeleton may be a mixture of multiple species from different orders. Though this debate is still in progress, and though the view of this book about avian history is interesting, it was far from the mainstream of the academic world even when it was written, and is much farther now. The readers should be aware of it."
4,Beautiful and easy to play!,"Rainbow Fish Memory Game is one of our children's favorites, and my husband and I often join in, too. The cards are sturdy and beautifully illustrated - some even have metallic accents - and this lends greatly to the pleasure of the game.The key to winning is simply to remember the location of the cards you turn over so you can match them up. To make the game easier for young children you can arrange the cards face down in a square or grid pattern. This helps you remember their positions more easily. For older children, arrange the cards face down in a more ""haphazard"" fashion and the game gets a little trickier.My only complaint about this game, and it's a minor one, is that many of the cards are so similar it can be confusing for some children. A lot of the fish look really similar but aren't exact matches. But then again, there is more than just one memory fish set, so that balances the difficulty out a little and makes it easier to get a set."
1,a raw deal,It sputtered and smoked the first (and only) time I tried to use it. No thanks!If I could give it zero stars I would. Don't bother!
2,Attractive But Messy,"I'm really surprised for all the praise. There are too many parts to clean -- longest clean-up time in my 20+ years of juicing. Bits of fruit and veggies do escape, splattering every which way. After 2.5 years of use, the juice is coming out pulpier. Not good."
5,Terrific,"The Breville is an incredible juicer. It is effective with little waste and lots of juice. It is light weight, not very difficult to cleanse and you can put whole apples and other chunks of fruit in itl It is comparably cheap to other models that perform with excellence"
4,Good juicer but not perfect,"I am enjoying juicing a lot and feel like I got a good deal for my money. The juicer is powerful, easy to clean, and seems high quality overall. My only real complaint is that sometimes the veg/fruit matter sprays slightly outside the machine and gets on the counter. I now place a towel over the front to prevent a mess. Also, although the pulp matter seems pretty dry, there are sometimes larger chunks of thinner produce, like spinach and kale, that aren't getting fully juiced. From what I read about other comparable juicers, they all have issues, so I am happy with what I have although it isn't perfect."
4,"Good juicer, but a little louder","It is a good juicer with nice looks. The design of parts is smart and that makes it easier to clean. It is a bit noisy though, but I guess it's because of its powerful motor. And contrary to what the maker says about juicing whole apples etc, that's really not true. I have to slice anything bigger than a small fruit/vegetable. But I have no issues with that. It takes me about 15-20 min from washing/peeling fruit/vegetable to cleaning the juicer. Overall I'm happy with my buy, and I've been using it daily since the day it arrived!"
2,Does not juice greens,"I did not see a review that said this, but if you are looking to make ""green drinks"" with lots of leafy greens, this is not the juicer for you. It is extremely fast with apples, carrots, beets, and other dense items, but with that speed you sacrifice a LOT of yield. Instead of a light, dry discard bucket, it almost looks like baby food - sweet, wet remnants of fruits and veggies. This juicer was obviously not what I was looking for, so I switched gears and got an EXTRACTION juicer, and have had a much better juicing experience so far!"
1,Hi RPM Destroy The Nutritional Value of Fruits,This juicer has a powerful motor that generates hi RPMs which in turn heat and destroy the nutritional content of your juice.Look for lower RPM and higher horse power
4,Is it too powerful?,"I have not yet purchased the Breville JE900 but my concern is its powerful 600 watt motor, I understand that it can be a good thing for getting the most out of your juicing experience however I read this on about.com ""A motor rating of 450 watts or greater is recommended. The heat from a more powerful motor will destroy the produce with oxidation. A less powerful unit will strain the motor and your juicer will eventually break down."" If anyone knows more about this please respond."
2,Absolute Beginner?,"This book is not for an 'absolute beginner'. It assumes that you know how to hold the violin, bow and finger placement. Stuff that as a beginner would not know. I found better learning aids for free posted on the internet."
3,Not for those of us learning to play from scratch,I thought this was an instructional guide to play violin with a few songs to practice. It's actually a book of songs for beginners. Only the first couple of pages have any sort of instruction and it is extremely lacking. I didn't find this book helpful in learning the basics of violin playing at all. Recommend ONLY if you already have the basics and want to try and learn some easy songs.
4,This product is great,"To whom it may concern:My daughter loves to practice her violin. She will put in the DVD and try to follow along in this book. We are ver happy we purchased this item.Sincerley,Harold"
3,A beginner's take on a beginner's book,"Things I like: easy to read and understand, progresses in logical manner, new things introduced quickly but not overwhelming.Things I didn't like: Proper holding and playing positions only shown in one small, poorly illustrated picture; you have to buy the $19.99 dvd to have any audio to gauge your performance or for more visualization of proper techniques.My suggestion: I would look for another book if I had it to do over again. Preferably one with an included cd or dvd and some better illustrations. These are things this book really should have had for the price."
2,lacking in some basics,"This book is really no good without also buying the DVD and CD. The book does NOT give any information about placement of the bridge (searched the web an I think it should be by the notches in the F holes, low end by E string) or how to tune or use rosin. The DVD gives some information about tuning and a little about finger placement. I don't have the CD, but think it is probably necessary so you can learn where to place your fingers to get the sound right.Edit: Well, I bought the CD and it does not have any commentary, or announcement of the song or enough pause to follow along. So I would downgrade this series to a 1 star. There are better choices. I feel like I really wasted the money, especially on the CD."
4,Have to see it!,"I think this is a great movie. It will keep you in suspense all the time. The drama is good, with a lot of action.*Sponsored Post"
1,"Do people give it 5 stars just because it's ""Bruce Lee?""","I think people automatically assume something is good just because it has Bruce Lee's name on it.This book lists a bunch of exercises, but doesn't show pictures for very many of them. The descriptions of the exercises are marginal at best. Pictures are useful when learning a new exercise, which is why they should definately be included in an instructional book. For this reason, the book as a learning tool is basically useless.It's got some interesting info about how Bruce trained, but many of his methods are outdated.If you're a Bruce Lee fanatic, it's worth a look at the library, but you may want to reconsider purchasing it.If you're not a Bruce Lee fanatic, and you just want a descriptive exercise book, steer clear of this one."
1,Big Time Rip-Off !,"Other than a couple of interesting tips, this book is NOTHING but descriptions of BASIC exercises, pull-ups, jumpimg jacks, curls, etc. It has some fair pictures of Bruce, so I'll keep it instead of paying for shipping and having nothing at all. Major disappointment, it's sad that this kind of worthless rip-off is ever published at all."
3,"Back up, kids.","Okay if you want Jane's Addiction songs with ""unn ttsss"" added into the background, I'm sure there is a CD in some gas station out there desperately awaiting your $5 purchase.I think this is a fun twist for people who just want to dance and happen to also like Jane's Addiction. The only thing about this similar to Jane's Addiction is the lyrics, and I think it's fun."
1,Difficult to use,"The cookie press was given to me as a gift and I had never before used one. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and discovered that neither instructions for how to use the device nor recipes were included! I recently tried using the press using my favorite sugar cookie recipe. No matter how I adjusted the dough consistency or what shape I attempted to cut-out, the entire experience was a disaster and not one cookie turned out."
2,Publ Adv Copy (pb) Sent as Hardback,The copy I received is a paperback publisher's advance copy. The description specified that it was a hardcover copy. Very bad.
4,first space ship on venus,"this is cool science fiction movie back in 1960 or so and the special effects i thought were pretty good there kinda silly little and maybe boring butt, i like the characters of all and the thought of venus like they show and the idea that somelife was on venus butt died off"
3,Informative but uninteresting,This is sort of your standard textbook. It tells you what you need to know but doesn;t really engage your artistic or design sense very much. I obviously bought it for use in a class but discontinued using it halfway through the class because I didn't find it to be much help. I definitey referenced it throughout the semester and do not regret buying it but it isn't exactly a book to get excited about.
2,Fast but Lo,"I was very happy with how quickly I received the textbook. It was bought as ""New"". Received it within 3 days of ordering it. Unfortunately, it was of poor quality. You can see through the pages and the type bleeds through. Paper was poor quality. I would not purchase again from this supplier as I advised them... and got no follow-up."
1,"Read Clayton Swisher's ""The Truth About Camp David"" instead","Dennis Ross only justifies himself. Camp David was a total disaster for all concerned and permanent Mideast honcho Dennis Ross is the reason.For ""The Truth About Camp David,"" read Clayton Swisher's book by that name.I work at a foreign policy think-tank. My buddies at the State Department tell me that Swisher's book is their textbook on how not to run a future summit. Read that one -- not Ross's badly-written,endless, longwinded self-apologia. Who cares that Dennis plays basketball at the DCJCC? Can he be more self-referential?"
1,"They were kidding, right?","Let me get right to the point... it doesn't work. For those that claimed it did... maybe they just WANTED it to work so badly that they convinced themselves there was a difference? It didn't work in our smelly diaper room or in our kitchen, not even in the tiny cupboard where we keep the trash pail. We followed the directions precisely, even rereading the little booklet incase we missed something. The only reason we gave it one star is that we didn't have the option of giving it none."
2,"Good bag, terrible design","These bags are not like the tall kitchen bags. Instead of having 4 flaps to tie, these black bags have only 3 that are evenly spaced from each other. In other words, you have no good way of tying the bags shut!!! Who ever designed these bags with the 3 flaps should answer me this one question... WHY? Oh WHY?"
3,They're OK,I should have got the 33 gallon. The 30 gallon isn't quite big enough. They're decent bags though. Trash can's a bit bigger than 30 gallon.
5,kitchen knobs,"Exactly what we wanted at an excellent price. We had been looking for the ""right"" knobs for a long time and these fill the bill."
4,"Took some effort to assemble, pretty good end result....","The little ""tool"" did not help. It took a while to get the cart assembled. Now that it is assembled, its a great addition to the back yard."
1,Never got it...,1 month and 2 days later i still havent recieved this product. Ill find it elsewhere.
1,Give me a break. This is Spinal Tap,"I am astonished to see all the positive reviews of this mediocre album. I listened to it a couple times back in the '70s when it first came out, because I was a major DP fan, but when I heard this, I was bummed. I've listened to it a couple of times since, and it still is very apparent to me that this is just mediocre stuff that was put out in the effort to leverage the Deep Purple reputation. This is surely the band that Rob Reiner had in mind when he came up with Spinal Tap. Not MKII Deep Purple, but this truly forgettable counterfeit incarnation. I can't believe that this was even re-released on CD."
2,deep purple is terrible!,"i hate deep purple very much! this album has only two good songs: burn and might just take,. but the vocals are very bad! and the music is poor! boring!"
5,A remarkable cable,"This is much heavier than I expected, and provides an excellent signal. I was concerned about the long cable run, but there's no noticeable loss of quality in the signal."
1,Yuck!,"1) Comparar a Moenia con Depeche Mode es una blasfemia; 2) Moenia suena a una imitación barata de alguna imitacion barata de Depeche Mode (como Cause&Effect); y 3) es una verguenza que este grupo se autoproclame como inventor del ""electropop""."
3,Recommeded for clear expanations.,The explanations are easy enough to follow along. The SQL code works for the chapters I read. I'd recommend it especially at the Amazon used price.
3,Covers Exam but is hard to use for quick reference,This book covers 90% of what you will see on the exam. The exam is tough in that it asks you to solve problems that are not covered in the book. All the information is in the book just not pulled together in a quick and easy to review format. If you have to take the exam buy this book. Read it twice then try a practice exam(if you can find one). Then review those sections you did poorly on.
2,A good intro but not really up to the test,"I used this as my main resource for studying for 70-028 (along with practice tests by STSWare and the online books). This was my last test for my MCSE and I passed first time, but only just. The test requires much more detail than this study guide (or STSWare) supplies. You really need to get down to the mechanics of how the various features of SQL Server work. This book just didn't supply it.My advice is either to use this and spend a lot of time reading the online books or wait until there are better third party study guides that are based on the release version of SQL Server (not the beta as most of them are at present) and the actual tests."
3,Flash Fire,You can run but you can not hide. the book that i been reading is a teen fiction. The main characters are jeff adn Caroline. There are thes two kids name Josh and Rachel. They are we playin with the matches and gas and they make a fire that gets out of hand. They drop the gas jug and the fire spreads to the woods. fire fighters try to put it out but its too much. No one thought that th fire would reach Pinch Canyon Moutain. The rich folks lived on that mountain and they did not Know that there houses was fisten to be burnt down. So the fire jumps the ditch and Jeff and Caroline try to run but caroline falls and her Jeff try to help her up. The fire is hot they are poring down with sweet. They keep on running they might make it alive and the might not maket out alive.
5,Worth Watching,"Boy, has television advertising changed over the years.If you are used to the gloss, color CGI ads that dominate the tube today you'll be shocked at what ads were like when television was first starting out.What they lack in techiclal details these ads more than make up for in how creative they were. They clearly didn't know what would work and what wouldn't so they tried every different type of approach they could think of.The quality of the footage is surprisingly good considering how old the clips are."
5,Love this soup!,"In the cooler months I can't get enough of this soup. I like to have it for lunch everyday. Right now it is hot (80's), so I haven't been eating it. But I intend to begin again soon as Autumn is coming."
2,kindergarten lace,"I was not impressed with this book. The opening paragraph states that Mary had collected lace patterns all of her life. Surely she had collected somethings that were prettier than the plain, boring and very 'solid'(Meaning, very little actual lace in the patterns) doilies exemplified in this book. Of the entire book there were only two doilies with which I would consider bothering."
2,Microsoft Wireless Mouse,"I believe that the wireless mouse will work great once I can install it correctly. Presently, there is some conflict and when I hook up the wireless mouse, the PC locks up. I have a list of things to try and am working my way through the list."
4,Charging issue solved!,"Many people, including myself, have had the issue of putting the mouse on charge and after less than a minute of slow green blinking it starts blinking red rapidly. Through many fourms and troubleshooting sites I have found a solution. Apparently the spring for the battery is not pushing on the battery enough to make a good charging contact. At first I thought that it would not work at all if the battery was not connected good enough so that couldn't be the issue, but after pulling the spring out a little further and replacing the battery I have has zero instances where the battery would not charge. Hope that works for you too."
4,Almost Perfect -- A Great Bluetooth Mouse,"I'm never a fan of Microsoft, but they actually got this one darn near perfect. The best thing is that the mouse is bluetooth, so you don't need to use a usb receiver if your laptop comes with bluetooth. I also like how long the mouse stays charged. I use it rather heavily for a couple of weeks at a time without having to recharge. Even then, it comes with a nice charger and quickly replenishes the battery.The mouse is very comfortable and fits well in my hand. My only complaint: it only has one button on the left side. I prefer my old Logitech that had two buttons (one for going forward and the other back). There is a button on the other side, but it's just not very easy to hit.If I could give it 4.75 stars I would."
3,Something to celebrate!,"... it's a book about a championship season in Philadelphia, and that's certainly something to celebrate ... and there's also some very interesting commentary thrown in from Bill Cunningham ..."
3,Good Walk Through A Great Season,"Overall, this book held a wealth of information that just isn't available elsewhere without delving through old newspaper. I enjoyed the first eight chapters, as they contain a pretty straightforward recap of the formation of the team, the actual season, and how the team eventually was broken apart. This book only gets three stars from me because of the dismissive way the author speaks of all other basketball teams that have ever existed. The 1966-67 76ers were a great team, and since the author is writing the book, it is his say in the end whether he felt they were the greatest. But the method that he takes to get to that conclusion is specious at best.Also, the author contends that in 1983 the 76ers were the first team to beat Boston in a seventh game in the Boston Garden. Actually, the Knicks were the first team to do this, en route to their second title in 1973."
2,"Not same class as ""Somewhere In Time""","I stumbled upon this as I searched for a copy of ""Somewhere in Time"". The outstanding 5-star reviews led me to order it, even though it was comparatively expensive. What a sucker. Made for TV, this movie just doesn't ever allow the suspension of disbelief. The dialogue is weak, the acting forced and unconvincing and the technical aspects just silly (like the soap-opera recovery from prolonged traumatic coma). No music. No magic. Rent if you must (if you can find it) but save your money."
3,Gift Item,"This item was purchased as a gift. It is a rather far-fetched love story.I would not purchase this for myself, not my cup of tea."
5,Rock on!,"This is a wonderful book that every single PERSON should read. Many of the concepts presented here apply to all of us. The book has an upbeat, yet reflective take on what single life is all about (and how rich it is in many ways.) It is articulate and full of examples from the author's life that many readers should find relevant and humorous. I highly recommend it to any single reader."
1,I would not recommend this mat.,.I was having trouble with slipping during my power yoga practice and thought that this mat might help. It was worse than the mat I was already using. In addition it has a terrible chemical smell. The claim that they will give you a free yoga class requires that you enter all kinds of personal information before you can even see if you are eligible. I would not recommend this mat.
2,Too slippery,"I had to return this mat, (Amazon has a great return policy), for the fabulous Hugger Mugger Eco-Rich mat. Even after washing I was I doing the splits in my forward folds"
5,An Amazing Debut!,"I first heard Adrienne Young while watching a local TV show here in Louisville called Now,That's Country. She and her group did several live performances and that was more than enough to get me completely hooked. This CD contains one impossibly beautiful song after another; 'Home Remedy' would be at the top of the charts in a just world, 'Sadie's Song' is genuinely frightening, and 'Conestoga' is maybe the most perfect song of heartache I've ever heard. But I picked those three almost at random. EVERY song, from beginning to end, is impressive and truly heartfelt. And she's an indie, too! Be kind to your ears and soul and buy this CD."
1,Horrible Customer Support,"Misunderstood directions, made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time.Cracked all sides trying to take apart. Called 800 # and asked what they could do for me and they said Buy another one, they're not responsible. Also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent. Suncast will never get my business again and I hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company."
1,krapp's last tape - arts and entertainment,"The play is written as a performance by a single actor. In this case the actor is simply unsuitable for the role, appears not to understand the play very well, and was also most incompetently directed: he spends a good deal of his time staring at the camera evidently waiting to be told what to do. Too bad! A great one-hour play!"
3,up converter,"This dvd player isn't what I expected, but what do you want for $85 bucks. It matches my 5686 Sammy and plays dvd's. I really don't see a big difference in picture quality but maybe it's just me."
2,Shuts off for no reason,"I have had this player for 3 months. It worked fine during this period, and the picture quality was decent given the price. However, it recently start shutting off automatically. It will play a dvd but doesn't get past the ""FBI"" copy right screen. I do not recommend this player."
1,Charlie and Ronald Lauder,"This conversation with Charlie Rose and Ronald Lauder was very enlightening. I will use it in a class on ""Jews on Trial"" where I will discuss the Adele Boch-Bauer Affair. I am sure the group will find it very intersting. I learned some things I didn't know even though I had researched the matter."
5,Good to have on hand,"If you are learning to use a straight razor or are prone to nicking when shaving, this $5 purchase will make you very happy. Like a piece of dense dissolvable chalk, you just wet the tip and touch it to the nick. It'll sting for a second but the salts will quickly seal up and dry the cut. Leaves a white residue behind so don't smear it everywhere, just a few dabs on the cut does the trick."
5,prompt arrival,It arrived promptly despite the fact that I ordered it during the holiday season and it does exactly what a styptic pencil is supposed to do. Will buy this product from this seller again.
4,Nice workout!,"I found myself really liking both Valerie and her trainer! I needed to get back into fitness and really enjoyed this workout. I double checked the run times and there was a 20 min and a 40 min workout. Not sure what happened with the other reviewers but they should contact Gaiam for the latest copy. Not sure that the ""bait and switch"" review really holds...I think if you're new or just getting started with fitness this is the PERFECT DVD. If you're looking for an advanced and exceptionally challenging workout then this may not be the workout for you. I took the trainer's advice and after 4 weeks started following him and adding jumps and extra reps and it made a huge difference. I find Valerie inspiring and will continue to use this workout! I did expect more out of the music - where was her son? It would've been 5 stars for me!if you're looking to start your journey into fitness this is the DVD!"
5,This dvd is wonderful,"I've owned this dvd for quite some time now and I credit the Level 2 workout with getting me in great shape. I love it so much that I purchased it again for someone else. It's not one of those daunting exercise videos that you dread having to face. I use 5 lb. weights and it's quite a workout but it's fun, fast, and effective. The dvd says the Level 2 workout is 40 minutes but it's only 28 minutes on my dvd and that includes warm up and cool down. The abs challenge in the bonus section is only 3 minutes but it's seriously intense and I throw that in once in awhile. Despite what some reviewers say, this dvd - especially the Level 2 workout - is not for beginners. I can only assume that those reviewers would be better matched with the hardcore P90X workout. If you want a workout you can live with, buy this dvd."
1,Still Selling the Abridged Version,"Admittedly I bought a used DVD of this workout. I own the same DVD but misplaced it and haven't been able to locate it so I purchased a replacement, only to find that the advanced workout is highly abridged, with all the cardio bursts cut out, and the exercises in a different order, and even some of the weight workouts have been shortened, with fewer reps. It is only 30 minutes, while the advanced workout on my original lost DVD was 40 minutes. I know the workout well and this one is very different. I'm going to return it anyway, because it's not at all what I wanted."
2,Too Bad it Wasn't Done Better,"I admire Valerie and feel a little guilty entering this review, but this is one of the worst workout DVD's I've purchased. The music is more Muzak, the trainer (Chris) doesn't always keep count, and he give amost no direction for the floor exercises-when we're not able to see the TV as well and need the verbal help. It's too bad; the workout itself is okay and a good start for those just getting into exercising. The badness comes from the way the DVD was made, which is sad considering there are so many experienced workout productions out there. Val, next time, pick someone who's got a successful DVD or two out there."
5,"Forscner 40615 6"" Boning Knife","I am fan of Forscner knifes because they are to me, a perfect blend of great quality and useability, unlike a knife which may be more of a collector's item than a usable tool. The Forscner 6"" boning knife is the perfect choice when a good filet knife is too flexible or fragile and a hunting knife is to heavy, stiff and unable to hold the cutting edge of filet knife. I use the 40615 in the field for everything from diving to a belt carried tool when necessary. It's certainly not an unbreakable blade but it is robust enough to use when a hunting knife may be too much and you may still need the ability to slice quickly and effectively. If I had to name a con, it is the lack of a good sheath for the knife. Without a good utility sheath, use is limited. The only sheath I've been able to find which allows me to use this knife to it's full potential is available only from Australia."
4,It is very short,"Hinduism: A Very Short Introduction is indeed very short, perhaps too short to do more than scratch to surface of a topic as complex and varied as the religion of Hinduism. This book is a very good introduction for someone who knows little about the subject and would like to learn more, however for someone who does know a something about Hinduism and would like to learn more it is a little unsatisfying. One is left wanting more."
5,IT WAS SOOO GOOD!!!,This book is a great book and I encourage anyone to read it. I think it's one of Christopher Pike's best! He did a wonderful job on the first one because it was soo real. Pleeaaasseee read it!
4,Nice BOX,EASY TO ASSEMBLE. FEELS VERY STURDY AND LOOKS REALLY NICE IN BACK YARD.WILL BUY MORE SUNCAST PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE
5,New Generator Enclosure!!!,We purchased this enclosure to house our new generator. The enclosure could be difficult to assemble for a small or weak person. We found the enclosure to be perfect for our needs.
5,Great Storage Unit For Price,I purchased this unit to hold my patio cusions for the winter and it is perfect. It was easy to assemble it looks great and it is definitely waterproof.
4,Good storage solution in the yard or around the pool,"I saw this at Sears, homedepot (online) and at Walmart (online) the other day and was very impressed. I have a pool and this shed come in handy in the off season to store all the pool stuff. If you have little kids, I am sure they will appreciate this as well (as a hide-and-seek, or play house!). Note the GS2000 is 30cubic and the GS1000 is 20 cubic ft in size. gs2000 also has the gs2000ba and bw models - mainly color variation. I personally like the brown/chocolate accent that gs1000 has, but prefer the extra room that the gs2000 provides. Price appears to vary quite a bit. My recommendation is shop around and find the best deal.I'll get this shortly and update first-hand experience soon!UPDATE: got the 20 cu. model from sears for 119. It is very easy to put together and has plenty of room to hold stuff. If you want the 30 cu. one, sears has it for 171."
4,Not bad for instant (healthy) hot cereal,"I try and eat healthy when I'm at work and it's even a bigger plus if it's quick and good. This is pretty good stuff, taste ok, not bad and not really good, but it's healthy. I would recommend it if you're on the go and need something quick and healthy. By the way, I tried a lot of these instant oatmeal cereals and this one so far is my favorite."
1,Waste of Money,"Horrible smell. I did smell vanilla, but also chemicals and a strong play-doh smell. Definitely NOT a spa experience. I'm throwing the jar out; I can't return it because it is opened.I contacted the seller AmericaRx and they said it ships new from the manufacturer. Although my product was sealed, maybe it was old and went rancid or maybe they changed the formula."
1,Nothing But Junk!,"System developed a ""popping"" & ""crackling"" sound and would shut itself down.Tried changing cables,cleaning inside reciever, this did not help. Would work for maybe 10 mins and POP & Crack and shut itself down. Paid almost $1000.00 for something I can not use. Onkyo will not return emails. Extremely bad Customer Service!!"
4,A little more...,"This unit seems a little more complicated than others, but complication fuels the need to learn. If one has to return to the owners guide to increase knowledge, then the learned process sticks... usually."
5,HP39GS Graphing Calculator,It takes a little to get used to because it's quite different from the TI brands but definitely worth the money!!
3,yep. Solid,"got my new clalucator in the mail 2day. really great calucator here guys, has all the best buttons, 1,6,8, theyre all here"
2,Damp check,This product is nice and it works well but I found a similar product in a store near me and its more convenient to buy.
2,Awful Product,"I picked one of these up from the Apple store and used it that day. Not only does the product not broadcast well (I had to hold it two feet from my radio, it didn't even get a signal in the car on any frequency) but it dosent stay in the dock connector. The transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the iPod. The transmitter also appears to turn off after 5 seconds of not touching the buttons. The LCD screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on. Because it worked so poorly I couldn't tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken. An indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain.If you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this. If you want something that works consider the iTrip by Griffin."
4,Great nano-stories,"This is a great series of stories dealing with nano-tech. As it true with all anthologies, they vary - some are really good, some not so good. I had already read Blood Music by Greg Bear and the first story is what he based that book on. Still good though.Overall lots of good stories."
2,"Run, dont walk - from this movie!!!",I'm a big fan of the genre of plausible 'end of civilization' scenarios. Although I'm neither an academic nor a fan of WWF level 'entertainment' I can usually find something redeeming about most films or books that I choose to lose myself in. Not so with this movie. I've never used my fast forward button so much. After half a dozen scenes of people meeting each other at the train station with all the generic romantic steam and slow pans of the train I thought my head would explode. With the movie running 3 full hours I was amazed that all the characters managed to stay fully one dimensional. This could easily have been condensed to 1 hour with commercials and not lost much in content. The fall of mankind due to radiation sickness is a rediculous backdrop for an epic romance. The two genres are like eggs and maple syrup; I like em both but mixing them only ruins both.
3,Hit and miss,"I saw the original screening of this in Australia a fair while ago now and loved it so i decided to purchase it. I was disapointed as the ending had been changed from the tv mini series into an ""USA saves the day"" ending. Not the sad intimate ending i expected."
4,"Mediocre DVD transfer, but a solid performance piece","I know, I know... they haven't released it on DVD yet, but for those of you who are interested, drop me a line and we can work something out--a few music stores sell all-region copies for a decent price, and this was one of the titles they offered!I'm a huge Armand Assante fan, and Bryan Brown has his moments, but Rachal Ward is the real star here. I've never seen the original and thus have no basis to compare the two, but tv-movie or not, any critic who bashes this is likely just too puritanical to be open-minded.Russell Mulcahy does a fair job with the obviously low-budget he's been alloted. Don MacKellar's ""Last Night"" (shot in Toronto) does a similarly good job with virtually no money in the budget, and you would do well to check that one out, too."
2,Has common problem,"In general, the vessel is well built.It just needs a simpler mechanism for allowing fluid flow through the cap so all surfaces are cleanable in the event that it sat for a couple of days and got moldy as did mine. So I don't use the flow-through button cap anymore. But while attempting to thoroughly clean it, I soaked it in dishwater and now, that dishwater has infiltrated the hollows in the cap and does not drain. It does, however, lend a smell of dishwater to my coffee."
1,Major disappointment -- cold drinks that spill every time,"I purchased this item a week or two ago and have been using it daily since then. I make drip coffee into the container. The coffee stays hot for maybe 1/2 hour and then is too cold to be good. Even worse, I end up with coffee on my desk *every single time* I pour a cup from this thing. I tip it forward to pour, but whenever I tip it back to stop the pour, even if I do so *over the cup* into which I'm pouring, I end up with coffee flowing over the spout and down the front of the item onto my desk and papers. If I hadn't throws away the packaging and receipt, I'd send this back straightaway. ""Completely unsatisfied"" would be a good way to characterize my feelings about this item."
3,Keeps My Water Cold But.....,"OXO Good Grips LiquiSeal Travel MugI have purchased several of these as water carafes around my home so I could give up bottled water.I like that they are stainless steel and they do keep my water cold, are easy to use and have the button lock to keep liquid from spilling out all over you.However..... the tops with the button (I don't mean the drinking cup) can easily NOT screw oncorrectly if you aren't paying close attention. When that happens and you go to drink from the thermos you end up with liquid dribbling down on you from where the drinking part and waterreservoir come together.Please, OXO can you fix the threading where these parts attach?"
5,Pungent Good Fun!,"I am absolutely appalled that this book is out of print. All those readers who have yet to experience the keen-wit and affected arrogance of the fabulous Mr. Andersen... really, it's heart-breaking. The Real Thing is extraordinarily amusing. I think it's safe to say that only certain types of people will enjoy this fabulous collection of satirical essays. His chapters on Affectations and Self-help Quizzes were especially hilarious. Many of the pop-culture references were before my time but, I still found the entire book humourous. I envy the elevation in experience of those readers who actually remember the early 80's. I urge everyone to track down a copy of this book. Mr. Andersen is my hero."
3,watch outfor formatting likeyou seehere,"Arrrgh. Who doesn't love Dostoevsky? Who doesn't love Penguin paperback editions? I bought this Kindle version anticipating no problems with translation or formatting. Well, the translation is certainly acceptable; Dostoevsky's style comes through. What utterly undermines my enjoyment is that the formattingall runs togetherlike this,j ust enought o makeyou crazy. Get the idea? It certainly takes the pleasure out by interrupting the flow of information from the eye to the brain.C'MON PENGUIN! YOU ARE CHARGING 9.99 FOR A BOOK IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. TAKE THE TIME TO PROPERLY FORMAT!"
3,Not full screen but matted to 1.85:1,"Direct to video title gets bad matting job the cuts off the top and bottom of the picture. Why? Even with the matting there is still an annoying VHS overscan line across the bottom of the screen. I almost gave it a rating of one, but this is Truth Or Dare we're talking about. Even if they matted it to 2.35:1 and cut off more of the picture it'd still be possible to enjoy as we're obviously not watching this for the cinematography. It should also be mentioned that it's non-anamorphic and picture quality is pretty rough too. On the plus side there is director commentary, trailers and a bonus featurette on the making of the film. 5 star 1980s trash flick, but what were you thinking with the presentation, Sub Rosa?Review is for the 2010 edition."
5,My girlfriend is from Singapore,She is a singaporean. SHe thinks that this is a very authentic portrayal of life in Sin gap ore
5,SWeet storage box,"Look I don't know what all the fuss is about, this storage box took longer to get out the shipping box than to put together. Shipping took two days WOW fast.. IT has rained had twice and no leaks. Large enough that everything fits. My old lady must like it too.. She ain't bitched about it at all.. Great buy I'd do it again.. Thwanks for listening,, RKK"
1,poor design,The exterior deck box is poorly designed and the fittings that hold the sides to each other and the bottom are inadequate. I had to separately purchase strapss to keep the unit from pushing out and coming apart.
3,Good but......,Good:Big plastic boxBad:The hinge mechanism is cheap and can easily break* If you overextend it backwards* Jam the pin in too hard.If you over-stuff (in my case cushions from deck furniture)the box comes flying apart.With these caveats in mind - seems like a good plastic box. Can hold two people sitting on it without issue.
3,Disappointing for Rubbermaid,"I'm surprised to see so many good reviews for this. For Rubbermaid, I found the quality of this wanting. The price was good, and there aren't many alternatives for this size. But Rubbermaid's reputation is better than this.The first thing I noticed is that my front panel was warped. Who knew plastic could warp? So there's a gap where it meets the side.Also, the hinges are junk - this really surprised me. Then there's the straps that keep the lid from flopping all the way back. Held on by a tiny sheet metal screw. All it would take to ruin the hinges, is a couple of excited kids getting pool toys out.I decided to cut the 'hinge pins' off and ran a 1/2 inch bolt through them.So I give it 3 Stars. It's 'OK' for the money. It does hold a lot of stuff. But Rubbermaid didn't put their best engineers on this project."
2,Broken corner ?,"There is a corner broke on one of the big walls.How can we handle this?I Like the item, but if i buy everything i would like to have a integrated whole one!by Marc"
4,Just like every one says,"Goes together very easy. Good for getting backyard ""things"" out of the weather and making the yard/house look more organized. I have a few Suncast Storage Sheds also, and they all will solve your problem. This is easier to put together if u care about such things. I may buy another."
5,Best Deck Box Ever,"We have owned other deck boxes, most of which did not last. This box was the easiest of all to put together and took all of ten minutes. It is 60"" long. We are especially appreciative of the sturdy cover with sliding bolt that holds it to the box. Other boxes have an interlinking plastic tab that soon breaks. By the way, you do not need a piece of wood to insert the sliding bold. Merely use a thin screw driver and hit the end of this with a thin hammer. End story.The assembled box holds all my towels, toys and other pool items.We get a lot of 60mph windstorms with rain and hail. I keep the box out on my pool deck. It has a predrilled hole in the front of the box where you can insert a removable bolt to hold the cover down. I never got one drop of water in the box.This box is well worth the extra money and I couldn't wait to throw out the cheaper box we had which had a broken (disconnected) cover. You get what you pay for."
5,Worth every penny,"It was a real coincidence that I discovered Mishka. I absolutely loved his first CD and I think the second one is equally as wonderful as the first. Last night I played it for two of my friends and they are hooked. I can't wait to hear more from Mishka. ""One Tree"" is well worth purchasing."
3,Ceiva is fine. Other new products look also cool,"Ceiva is a great concept, and I believe was the first one of that kind in the market. Quality is still poor, and price expensive though.You can find some other products (some also sold on Amazon) dedicated to non-computer users or users experiencing troubles to download and display emails and/or pics, such as the MailStation (provided by Earthlink), the Pacific Digital Memory Frame (provided by Pacific Digital), the MailBug (provided from Lander) and FamilyMail (free beta version on their site)."
1,CEIVA SUCKS,"I was very excited to buy the CEIVA for my mother for Christmas 2002. Since then, we have had nothing but problems. I purchased it so that she could stay in touch across the miles when we had a new baby. Too bad the CIEVA didn't work for the first 10 weeks of my baby's life and it took the company that long to get us a replacement part. Unfortunately, I let my sisters talk me into buying a second machine THIS Christmas for my father. The first machine didn't work (on Christmas Day, how disappointing!) and had to be replaced. Now, it won't let me upload pictures. Their customer service is absolutely AWFUL and I never hear from them in less than 48 hours. Since I have had these two machines, I must have asked for refunds 3 or 4 times. Mostly, I am disgusted that such a GREAT - seeming product really STINKS. Don't buy it unless you are committed to daily frustration."
3,"Exaggerated artwork, good story.","The artwork is so annoying that I had trouble getting past that to a fairly interesting story. To bad the cover art is absolutely not like what is on the inside. The story includes Han and Chewy, along with their old buddy Lando. They met up with Boba Fett, Ig-88 and Dengar. This story takes place before new hope, so I give it a -1 on the timeline. Pencil get 2 stars, story 3 and inking get a 4 for a 3 star rating.. you'll want to read this one."
1,Item not as described. DO NOT PURCHASE,Technical Details claims the item to be 3H'(3 feet). If you go further down to the Product Description way down to the page you will see that the item is actually on 16 inches. This is very deceiving. They got me don't let them get you.
1,Only 16 inches!,The toy was less than half the given size--it ended up measuring around 16 inches. Very disappointing to be ripped off.
2,"Weak Paddle, only for beginners.","This blade should only be used by those very new to the game who have no intention of playing competitively. I am a strong amateur who read the reviews here and purchased the paddle. When I played against people who used stickier high-spin rubber, the rubber on this paddle was so weak that the rubber could not grip the ball. When this happens, it causes the rotation on the ball to reverse and the ball goes down into the net. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, however I let an 1800+ player use it and he could not get the ball over the net when I was using his own sticky paddle against him due to the spin reversal.One thing worth knowing on this paddle is that the black side is stickier than the red side. This means if you do use it, you'll definitely want to use black as your forehand.The weight of the paddle and the handle are both excellent."
4,Derek May works well,I enjoy using this racket. I'm basically a defensive player and this racket doesn't do anything crazy when I return slams. I'm still able get a reasonable amount of spin on the ball but I clean my racket before I start play. This is a great all around racket for the intermediate (1400) player on a budget.
3,Disapointed Leather?????,The size is good but when you touch it does not feel like leather. Even the effect in the picture is not the same. When you look at the picture it looks like two tone around the edges near the stitching like leather. But does not have the same effect in person and does not have that leather smell. Really feels like fake leather. And no labels to confirm if it is leather or not. Sure hope I am wrong. If I am not it is really not worth more then what I paid for it. If you really want leather I would think twice before purchasing it.
4,Leather storage ottoman,"I was pleased with the quality of the ottoman, the leather, and storage are great, the brown color is very dark brown, overall a great product for the money."
3,Green with envy,I love the light it looks great very bright. I rated it a 3 because I thought it was strips instead of individual wired LEDs
3,This is a penhold handle,The racket is nice however the description does not say it's a penhold grip racket so if you're a handshake grip this racket is not for you. I am returning it.
4,like it!,Another great toy for puppy! Great for playing and teething! The loop is works as a great handle when playing!
1,easily the lamest song in existence,"This song is in no way better than the horrible BritneySpears/NSync/BackstreetBoys denomination. It has a terrible beat, melody, and also a terrible music video if ever you've had the misfortune of seeing it. It horrifies me that this song even got airplay, not to mention its multiple weeks at the top spot! What is this world coming to? I could make a better song with a blade of grass and a mammoth's tusk. There is no way this completely awful song deserves to be on the radio! I loathe it with all my soul! I'm ashamed to be in the same country as this single! Never buy this, listen to it, or even look at it. The song is so terrible."
5,NZ doesn't have conspiracies - yeah right!,"This book written by one of New Zealand's best investigative journalists, is well worth the read.Much of the book centres on the shady dealings of big business who allegedly ripped off the NZ tax system by millions of dollars through an elaborate scheme that became known as ""the winebox"".Those who did not want to see this book come to print spent two years, and a million dollars trying to ban it.The section of the book dealing with the mysterious death of Paul White, has now been turned into a movie by leading movie director Geoff Murphy called ""Spooked"".Paul White was a NZ computer dealer who unwittingly purchased disks containing highly sensitive International Banking records as part of a second-hand computer deal.The events leading to the ""accidental"" death of Paul, give credance to the view that he was ""taken out"".This is one of those books where you can feel the adrenaline coursing through your veins!"
2,"Interesting, but shallow and poorly written","I do enjoy good erotica from time to time, and BDSM literature fasinates me. I also enjoy ""thought-provoking"" books on a regular basis. I was impressed by Adamson's attempt to probe more deeply into her characters, but I still felt that they were weak and cliche."
3,Need Better Packaging,"The plant was just as described, just a little smaller than expected. The shipping was extremely fast. The packaging was pathetic. The flower was in a small plastic flower pot(ok)but the pot was put in a small plastic dixie cup taped together with masking tape. When I received the package and opened it up, the pot was turned sideways inside the popcorn packing and was out of its pot upside down in the dixie cup. The plant itself had several brown pitcher leaves. I had noticed others had the same problem and thought it was isolated to them, but it wasn't. Packaging of the product needs to be totally rethought!!!!!"
1,Never Again,Why I bought this plant is not how it turned out. What a waste of my money. Never again. The description/information which made me buy it is nothing like what I got. Very disappointing.
2,not all that i expected...,"i loved the fact that this product contained all natural ingredients, but i didn't feel like my hair became any more soft, shiny, or moisturized. in fact, it made my hair feel a bit course after treatment and my hair dried.i was excited to try more of the products by this company, but i think i will have to decline because of my unhappiness with this product."
5,A great tool,"I think this book is just great. It really helps you think about the performance of your direct reports and to articulate it clearly. I appreciate the way the book is laid out too - very helpful ""goals"" section helps you give constructive feedback to your employees. This book literally sits open on my desk as I write each review."
2,Not much life,This replacement battery did not improve the talk time on the phone for which it was designed. It was a replacement battery and the old battery worked better than the replacement.
4,Rev. Billy CD,"Very good, but I would recommend the videos instead, particularly ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" Only buy the CD if you can get it really cheap, or if you already have the DVDs."
5,The Right Place at the Right Time,"This is a too little-known book. MacNeil, whom many of us got to know on 'The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour', had a brilliantly diverse journalistic career before winding down on PBS. The book is full of interesting stories, told in the historical context of their time and the directness of a reporter's style. MacNeil clearly also has a good sense of humor which adds a nice touch.Even if you're not particularly interested in foreign affairs, you'll find plenty interesting in MacNeil's experiences abroad. Spend a little on this book -- it's worth your time."
4,"A classic selection, up there with Buena Vista Club","The songs on this CD deserve to be in every juke box in the country -- NOW! Besides being an infectious and unforgettable array of South African classics, you'll hear songs that reflect American Jazz influence and inspiration for American Do-Wop music of the fifties (listen to the Manhattan Brothers ""ooh maw maw"" chorus). Check out Solomon Linda's Original Evening Birds doing a soulful version of the ""Weemaway song."" This is a timeless CD that deserves its place in every college dorm, every party, and every dancehall in the country."
4,Don't miss this,"Don't go away is a good song, one of the best from the not so popular Be Here Now LP. All the songs were good, just over produced however. The title track of this single is no different, would have sounded a lot better stripped down but here it is as it sounds on the album. The real reason to buy this song is for the 3rd track, 'sad song'. From The definitely maybe era it is one of my fave all time Oasis songs and available for the first time on this single. Unless you can get Definitely maybe on vinyl. Warchild version of fade away sounds good in its acoustic here too."
2,GOOD BUT...,NO LENGTH WAS SPECIFIED. BIKE IS A SMALL TRACK BIKE (49 CM). ADAPTER WAS TOO LONG. AFTER GRINDING OFF NEARLY AN INCH IT FIT NICELY AND WORKED WELL.SELLER WAS MORE INTERESTED IN FEEDBACK THAN SATISFACTION.
4,A surprisingly mature album,"Ray Davies, who wrote and samg all the songs on this album, was still in his mid-twenties when this album was released, but it has the sound and feel of the music of one at least fifteen years older. In fact, it puts one in mind of some of the wistfully nostalgic albums Davies' contemporaries would make fifteen or twenty years later. But this Miniver Cheevy-like music is not only nostalgic, it's also really good. It stacks up well alongside the several great albums the Kinks made between 1966 and 1971. It's a pity that when the Kinks are mentioned, people can't seem to get by ""You Really Got Me."" There is so much more to the Kinks' work, and this album illustrates that beautifully."
2,"No instructions on how to use, does not cut tarp","I was disappointed with the lack of instructions that came with this set. It seems like the manufacturer assumes that you have used a kit like this before and you know what you are doing. It does not say which part is used for cutting a hole and which one is used for snapping the grommet pieces together. I did my best guess, but the cutting operation simply doesn't work, either due to dull edges on the sharp piece or, again, due to lack of instructions. A few pictures on step 1-2-3 and how you place the grommet against the tool would have been quite helpful. The prices is good, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,all of everyything!!,"This camera undeniably puts samsung ahead over the top digital camera manufacturers [sony,panasonic,canon, etc..]. The i6 is a beautiful, compact, and fully-loaded piece of machinery. The pic. quality is amazing, the video compression [Mpeg-4] is top notch. I have bought a 1GB mem. card, fearing the rumor that the 2GB memory cards malfunctions and doesn't work. I really need someone to confirm this. Any help will be appreciated, thanks. Even though i am really picky, I would really recommend the i6 to new or even professional photographers. C'mon- you could be listening to your fav. song while taking pics. U can even surisingly watch movies."
4,satisfied so far,"I can confirm the positive experience with this camera.I am currently using a Transcend 150x SD-Card with 2 GB. It works flawlessly. Has anyone been able to use a 4 GB card in it? I know from the previous review that it does not work, but maybe other memory brands are supported with 4 GB?"
3,P.C. IS FINE. BUT!,"PRETTY EXPENSIVE P.C.NEW WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM HAS A LOT OF FLAWS! TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO BOOT-UP.NEED TO BUY A HIGH DEF. P.C. MONITOR W/HDMI INPUT TO VIEW IN TRUE HIGH DEF.PURCHASED HP 24"" HP HDMI HIGH DEF. MONITOR. PICTURE IS VERY BRIGHT & CLEAR (TRUE HIGH DEF.!) BUT BLACKS OUT ON OUTER RIGHT CORNER?OVERALL COST ARE HIGH.ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LIVING USING THEIR P.C. DAILY FOR LONG PEROIDS OF TIME."
2,A word of caution.,"This book is a suggested supplement by the homeschooling curriculum that I use; I make it a habit to preview books before passing them along to my kids to read and I'm glad I did with this one. Just as a word of caution, three quarters through the book the following line appears, ""I bit my lip. I needed some excuse to get up. 'Then may I go, er, well, to take a piss, sir?' I asked"". This book could be read aloud and the previous line be omitted, however I chose not to use the book at all, there are other choices."
4,model change,"I bought this as a replacement UV clarifier as the first one was left out in the frost and water got into the unit and shorted the ballast. This unit is functioning very well,and is well constructed. I was disappointed that even although the description and label for the 2 units are identical they are a totally different size and none of the parts of the first will be useable as backup for the new one. Also the connection with my filter circuit had to be cut off and rebuilt. The units were purchased via amazon 2 years apart."
4,Nails greatly improved,"I have never used false nails and have never had a professional manicure; but every nail was splitting and tearing, which also caused them to catch on everything and tear even deeper. My fingers had become tender because they were no longer protected by my nails which were tearing below the quick; and I could no longer grasp anything with my fingertips. In desperation, I went to the dermatologist. The dermatologist believes medication and/or anesthetic relating to surgery 6 mos. earlier was probably the cause. She suggested using Elon Nail Conditioner on my nails daily (which I could only find online)and taking Biotin. My nails started healing within 2 weeks; and after a month, they started growing out normally and are much stronger. My nails are now whole and my fingetips are protected. I am very grateful."
2,Ruined by Hollywood,"I read the book ""Captains Courageous"" by Rudyard Kipling (great book, excellent message, very difficult language) with my children. Knowing they missed much of the story, we watched this movie to fill in the blanks for them.What a waste! We were disappointed in many ways. They changed the story terribly! In the book Harvey is not an orphan, his best friend doesn't die, and the captain is an excellent role model, not some ultra-distant and sometimes emotionally outraged man. It was horrible! We all agreed that the storyline was far better as originally written. It wasn't a case of a few minor details being changed, the entire virtue of the story was diminished. Why? Why? Why?Looks like there is a 1937 version we'll have to try. Back then I'm sure it was okay to teach life lessons about working hard, growing up, and appreciating family without needing to write them out of the storyline or making it really cheesy in the process."
4,We both liked the movie,"We have two different versions of 'Captains Courageous' movie and each one is unique. My husband likes old western, comedy and old action flicks, whereas I prefer movies that are based on non-fiction, historical, comedy, musicals, classics and chic flicks. I have to admit we both loved this movie. The acting and the story line were very well done. We have enjoyed both version. Comparing this one to the other, this one stood up equally."
1,lack of subtitles,"There are no subtitles in sets 1,2 and 3. Who knows if later on they are included. The least they could do is to have them as every other English detective story provides them. My advice is you are having difficulty understanding some of the language or are hard of hearing skip these"
4,The legacy lives on!,"Well...as an avid Traveller player, I was very interested inseeing what SJG could do to Traveller. I approached buying the gamewith great apprehension. But, in the end I was throughly satisified.Sure, I beef with the GURPS mechanics, but there is more than enough background info which one can overcome that by possessing another rulebook. If you are a Traveller collector, which owns everything that GDW ever produced for the game...then this game is not for you (you will find too much repetition). But, if you are like most of us with a decent Traveller collection. You will find happy to see everything under one roof, so to speak. In the meantime, lets hope T5 is everything we want!"
5,Priyanka Priyanka Priyanka,"The (IMHO) most beautiful woman on the planet in almost every shot? Well lit, well dressed, and done up? Giving a performance that'll have you hope she'll do a Hollywood movie soon? That's 'Fashion'!This one's MANDATORY for Priyanka Chopra fans.You'll fall in love with the characters and the story. There aren't any cheesy song and dance numbers, which are typical for Bollywood movies. Despite its run time, Fashion has a great pace and there isn't a boring minute.The acting in general is more Bollywood than Hollywood, meaning some overacting and not always entirely believable to many US audiences. You'll see what I mean when you watch Fashion. Which you should. Because it's awesome."
4,Helpful in easing my concerns,This book was helpful in reminding me that eating is a natural thing that babies know how to self regulate and the best thing we can do is to be supportive as they exercise this skill. There is so much to read about infant and toddler nutrition that it can be overwhelming and this book helped ease a lot of my anxiety about the topic.
2,"Too long, too rigid, but not a bad principle","I originally bought this book right as my child was almost ready to start solid foods at about 5 months old. She is now 17 months old and I have just recently managed to finish this gigantic and dull tome. I am not a slow reader, this book is just painful to slog thru, it did not hold my attention at all because the author basically states 1 principle and then proceeds to endlessly repeat it for hundreds of pages. She is also quite convinced that her way is the only correct way to feed a child. I have found that the division of responsibility idea does work very well for me and my child, but I have found no need to be as rigid about meals and snacks as the author claims that you need to be in order for your child to progress along properly in her development. I am not convinced that grazing is a bad practice, and that that may not be the best strategy for some families."
5,Let's go to Nordland!,"I am a new fan of Bathory. This was the first Bathory album that I purchased. I listened to the sound clips and they sounded pretty cool so I decided to get the CD. When I listened to the Cd for the first time I was just BLOWN AWAY! I have never heard anything with so much power and beauty as this CD other than the greatest band ever(DEATH). This CD is full of memorable guitar riffs and vocals. The whole album is perfect, every song is great. I recommend this album to anyone who listens to real metal."
3,JP:E DVD game,"Its okay, I was able to enjoy it, but I personally would suggest that this is geared more towards a younger child, but I still have a lot of fun with it, a JP fanatic myself."
3,it's okay,"The cds are pleasant enough to listen to, but are either outdated or Spain-Spanish. For example, they used an infrequently used word for husband rather than esposo...which is a lot easier to remember! also, they should have offered the most frequently used words in certain categories, but they picked an odd assortment. for example, they had few vegetables, but one was 'cabbage'. The concept for this CD series, but the execution was off."
4,A good one!,"This was a very good book to give some easy tips to anyone that wants to become better organized. I'm a pretty organized person already, and I read the book because I can always do better. I got some really good ideas and inspiration with simple, easy to follow instructions. Each chapter is very short and easy to read. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Use for Doughs, Not Batters...","My experience with silicon bakeware has been very positive; I love my Llorente. However, the price is awful and their bread pans are not standard sized. I ordered these because they were larger than Llorente's and I'll be using them for doughs. I haven't tried them yet, but think they will be satisfactory. Nevertheless, I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer. These pans are not structurally reinforced, and I wouldn't recommend using them for any batter breads. I checked on similar pans at the national home stores and what is being carried is no more sturdy than these pans. Further, the pans are 2 1/2 to 3 times more expensive. If Roshco had a frame or sled device available, that might solve the problem. Bottom line - pay more and get really sturdy stuff from Llorente or work with these pans and save money."
3,"Works, but kind of dinky for the price","It does it's thing and it collapses down well, but it seems a bit dinky for the price. It can barely be made to fit on with the barn doors installed (as long as they aren't too far closed), but just barely. I wish it had a longer mounting arm on it as that would help in some situations.If you use barn doors or something and have them closed up enough, you probably want to just tape a gel onto them with gaffer's tape anyway. Otherwise you'll need this or something like it to hold gels."
4,""" Moonlight Becomes You""","Good songs and better bits are in this ""Road"" entry in the series.""Where we,re going, why we,re going we are not so sure.....I lay you 8 to 5 that we,ll meet Dorothy Lamour""Ad libs and hi jinx galore..with Bing selling Bob to pay for lunch. Anthony Quinn along for the ride of course..before he started acting. ( what a terrific job he did at that)"
4,My Favorite Blooper,"I'm not going to go into why the Hope & Crosby ROAD films were so much fun--enough folks have done that already.I will say that ROAD TO MOROCCO features one of my favorite bloopers:It's right at the beginning. Bing and Bob are stuck in the Sahara desert when a camel takes turns licking their faces. When they see the camel, they're thrilled at their good fortune, exchanging lines while the wary camel keeps leaning back--Then--PTOOEY! The camel spits right in Bob Hope's face. Unscripted. Right in the middle of his line. And Bing laughs out loud.And they left it in the film!Priceless!"
2,ambivalent? polarization of opinion?,"This is [not good]. All the women are white. The heroes are racists, sexists & ableists. The scenes where Bing is beating the [snot] out of Dotty were cut out. I loved this movie. Bob's ending was great. If these guys could have cussed, this would have been the most tasteless slop ever slopped together. This is horrible. Bob & Bing rip."
3,How can I fish in black and white?,"Good information;however, would have been nice to have the pictures in color to better id the fish."
4,BUYERS BEWARE,A WORD OF CAUTION!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE STUPID AMOUNTS OF MONEY THESE COWBOYS ARE ASKING FOR!!!!!!!!! GO TO DISCOGS.COM AND YOU can KOP IT FOR LESS THAN $3.
2,Good History,"As a reader who likes to get my history along with a good story, this is a difficult read. I might have enjoyed it had I not ever read Jeff Shaara's books."
1,"Horrible movie, horrible message","Where to begin! This movie was horrific. It started out well enough, hard working ""Barbie"" supporting her family.Then Charm School begins. I have nothing good to say. Bullies, both among peers and teachers. Mean girl behavior. Strict focus that appearance is all that matters. Princesses lessons that consist of tea pouring and curtsies, because obviously that's all princesses are good for. ""Barbie"" has the self confidence of a jelly fish. Worst yet? At the end of the movie she gives her bully a coveted position as a reward for ""helping"" her. Help, which comes by the way in the form of leaving a window open so ""Barbie"" can commit a home invasion in the name of the greater good. Her two best pals who stuck by her and encouraged her? Tossed by the wayside in favor of a bratty bully.Are. you. kidding. me.This movie is garbage. I'll be sticking with the Barbie worth watching, in the older movies!!!"
5,Perfect for Barbie movie fans,My daughter loves every Barbie movie that comes out and this one is no exception. She loves that it's about princesses as well.It's a cute story about finding out who you are and dealing with people who can be mean to you.I like that it showed how to handle bullying. Something more movies need to focus on.
5,Best Value,"I decided to learn to play violin at 58 years old, and I want to hear good tone evenif I'm playing Twinkle Twinkle Lttle Star. The Piastro Wondertone strings hold theirtone longer than other brands of comparable price that I have tried."
4,A solid installment in the series.,"Jonathon King's second installment in the Max Freeman series is very good. I almost did not purchase the book when the Amazon synopsis said it was a less than promising sequel. But I couldn't disagree more. The book does take Freeman from the river in the Everglades where he is trying to get past his justifiable shooting of a twelve year old boy during a convenience store robbery in his native Philly. The story brings back Billy Manchester, Freeman's friend and attorney who is trying to determine who is killing elderly black women in a rundown Miami neighborhood. Returning also is Richards - a detective who caught Freeman's eye in King's debut novel and is again involved in the investigation. King's prose is enough to keep me reading the series - and the fledgling romance that manages to interest without derailing the story."
4,Book 2 in the series is an improvement,"opinion only -no story spoilersThis second installment in the Max Freeman series, continues with the main characters and the alternate story setting, but the writing definitely improves and the story flows more smoothly than the introductory book.The book introduces a new character in the beginning in such a way that it draws you right in off the start, and our reluctant hero ends up not so reluctant in this story. A few more plot twists, and the main characters are filled out a more, but still an easy read comparable to Steve Hamilton's Alex McKnight series. Like any series novels, read them in order starting with ""The Blue Edge of Midnight""."
4,Comprehensive overview,"The book offers a comprehensive overview of issues related to infertility, including medical, psychological, and financial. One shortcoming is that the discussion of age and fertility is too brief. A major strength is the medical discussion, which very clearly explains not only the basics, but also the many tests which may be part of an infertility evaluation. The personal stories and comments are also insightful."
5,Not your average tale!,"Stunning first novel, a unique and dark tale. Probably the most stunning thing about this book is that it is said to be pseudo-autobiographical. I could not put this book down, I had to know what happened to Con and Lordie. From Europe, to Chicago, to Boston you will follow the lives of these children with the obsessive desire to discover what's around the next corner!"
4,"Good, but not great","This is a good controller. There are some cons that I recognize might be because of personal preference.These are:-All plastic design. There is no rubber.-A,B,X,Y buttons feel a lot more raised than the original X360 controller, and they're not as rounded off (X360's are dome like if I remember correctly).However, there are some cons I believe you should consider:-Thumbsticks have no rubber coating, so your fingers might slip all the time if you have dry hands like me.-Thumbsticks do not have the little bumps that the original X360 controller has.-Dpad sucks! At least with my controller, you have to be careful to push the directional buttons rather precisely if you want to have consistent movement in any direction. My controller's dpad often leans too far in a direction other than the one I'm trying to go to. Annoying at best.Overall, if you need precise dpad control, don't get this controller."
2,Faulty,"I bought this controller to use for co-op play. It worked fine for a few months, but now the responsiveness of the joy sticks is erratic at best. Usually it acts as if the joy sticks are being pulled in one direction or another. Other times it is just completely non-responsive to them all together. I would not recommend this product."
1,Really Disappointing,"This book is garbage. It gets 1 star for creative effort. The book is rife with 15 year olds drinking (in front of other parents with their permission as well as their own parents), smoking pot, having sex, bigoted remarks and swearing at their parents. I'm no Pat Boone, but I gave this to my 15 year old son who also plays hockey and had a concussion. I read it after he did and was disgusted in myself for giving it to him. Really surprised Random House published this. The plot was really lame too."
5,Deltora Quest is the Best!,"I am a seven year old boy and my mom read the Deltora Quest series to me and every night my 11-year old brother came in to listen too- he also loved them. I think they are great!! The best part about these books is that there are clues to figure out along the way. This is the best series I have ever read. ""Return to Del"" is my favorite of the series because it's the most exciting and a lot of mysteries are revealed in this last book."
5,Great Deck Plate,"I purchased this deck plate to mount behind the seat on my FSD12 SOT kayak. It was very easy to instal. I also purchased a rubber gasket from bass pro to ensure a tight fit and used marine grade nuts and bolts. I tend to go a little overboard with my projects so i also used a marine grade silicon to for an extra seal, though I dont think this was neccessary. This hatch has came in handy when on the water and paking gear."
5,Nice Watch,"Just received this watch. Great price ($380 through Amazon), and delivered quickly with no additional charge. The watch is quite visually striking. It is large and heavy (compared with my previous titanium Seiko kinetic), but I am getting used to it quickly. I can't speak for its reliability, as I have only had it a few days, but my previous Seiko kinetic is great and keeps excellent time. I don't know if I really need the leap year indicator. I would have preferred if it had the day of the week instead. I love the idea of the perpetual calendar."
2,Disappointing aesthetics compared to the Arctura #SNP009,"I own an Arctura SNP# 009 and have worn it everyday (jogging, work, outings) for over a year; the piece still works perfectly confirming the technology and quality. I enjoy that model so much that recently I decided to buy a similar model in the series- hence the Coutura SNP #007. I received it today and all I can say is, shame on me for not conducting due diligence. Just a cursory look at the web pictures, the piece looked very attractive. However, out of box, the overall visual impact was disappointing. I assumed both watches will look identical except for the dark inset in the SNP007- far from it. If the concept of classic, ""understated elegance"" appeals to you, the benchmark, nolo contendere, is the SNP #009. I only wish the SNP#009 goes on sale again at Amazon for 399$. As for the SNP#007, as much as I hate dislike the practice, I will be ""returning"" it."
4,faults,"My friend bought this nice but fault book since last RSNA and we discovered that some pages listed below were blank . The serial No.&Other No.are : RC925.7.M88 1995 616.7'07543-dc20 DNLM/DLC 94,44679The pages No. are :118&119- 122&123- 126&127- 130&131- 134&135- 138&139- 142&143- 146&147 can you help me to get at least copy of these blank pages thank you Iam looking for your reply"
3,This is Not Cormega's Album,"Bottom line, this album is not Cormega. It is no more than a mixtape to me. The songs are decent but I am just waiting for Urban Legend. Dona is outright pitfull. Truthfully, I can only bump about four songs off of this album. I'll just wait for his solo.Top 3 Songs: Redemption, Dangerous, and Let It GoBottom 3 Songs: Respect Me, The Bond, HoodySleeper: Bring It Back"
3,Queensbridge's Prodigy,"First off I support any queensbridge rapper to the fullest regardless of their album. People have to understand the queensbridge style of rap to feel them. There is nothing special about their lyrics, because they are always going to be hardcore in every aspect. Cormega album is tight. It's versitile! The only thing I can say I didn't like about the album is that girl Dona he has featured all over his album. Not saying she isn't tight, but it is suppose to be a solo album. Cormega's style is always going to be the same. The production is tight and he has some good quality artist featured on there. To be honest, it may not be his best album, but it is my favorite Cormega album and I do own all of them! Queensbridge fans support ya mans. If not then your not a TRUE fan of the bridge."
4,Great historical fiction,"This is just a great adventure, especially for girls who are not ""girly girls,"" as my daughter says. My daughter is 9 and loved this book. We both learned more about the time period and the Silver Rush, but the information was blended seamlessly with the story."
5,A great Japanese film,"With moving scenes of the daughter and father, and realistic if violent and bloody sword action, this tale of a samurai doing his best for his family is a treat. Very well made."
1,Not even close to Roxette,"I was expecting something kind of Gesslish or more like Roxette, but what i'd found was an old recording with poor arrengments, it sounds too old and too amateur (Worse than a garage band demo)."
1,Hartz tuff stuff not so tuff,"I purchased the Hartz dog toy for my 4 month old puppy because it said on the packaging that is was tuffer than your average dog toy ...sick of buying cheaper toys that my puppy destroys , I purchsed it. Gave it to Lola, she loves it... one problem... she destroys it in less than 12 hours...half of that time she was sleeping. can't these companys make toys that don't get destroyed all over the house? at this rate I'm going to have to take out a 2nd mortgage on my house to keep my puppy happy and my furniture chew freeHartz Tuff Stuff Retriever (Colors Vary)"
4,"Perfect for me, a beginner","The level of control makes this a great bat for the new or intermediate player still looking to find their form.I can get some speed and I can get some spin and more advanced player have used it and like it ... but it is best for control and placing the shot. Very reliable, well made, light, you can hear the sweet-spot.This is a no-brainer for the casual player or beginner."
4,A good solid read,"The book kept me interested, mostly because of the author's writing. The story is strong, the writing is mostly linear, (although the flashbacks seemed to appear too often), and the characters well defined. However, I found the character of Tommy and Kyle a bit too predictable. I became annoyed after a while at Nathan's and Tommy's lack of moral backbone. More crucial than the their incest and Tommy's disregard of his own partner's feelings, the characters seemed to continually ignore each other's sensitivites, until got ""pouty"" or started crying, which they seemed to do, far too often.The story had some nice strong scenes, with a nice sense of a seashore community. I would have liked the archeology story to go somewhere, but felt, after all, it wasn't necessary.Still, the work is superior to others of the genre and worth the read."
3,Mixed Review,"There are so many things that I enjoyed about this book. The writing is marvelous - both dry and witty, and very engaging - which is the reason this book received three stars rather than two. The writer has a talent for conveying depth of emotion that the principle character is feeling; mostly anger but also tremendous desire to love and to be loved. The difficulty I have with the book is that there is so very much anger that I became uncomfortable with it. Also, there is very little resolution following the climax of the story. It is a little too neatly wrapped-up at the end, and if anything else, this book demonstrates that there is nothing neatly wrapped in the life of these characters. The ending was not in sync with the rest of the book. Wonderful writing; poor to average story."
4,Great for the Beginner and Experienced Alike,"I've studied tae kwon do ever since I was 4 since I have Korean background. After that, I followed Bruce Lee's ""do what works for you"" method and learned wing chun and tai chi and my fighting style incorporates a little of everything. Bruce Lee's JKD was a bit like that and he did what was best for him. Now this book presents his fighting style in a clean, organized way. The photos are clean and the text teaches the beginner basic moves that you can do when an attacker approaches you. I suggest you get the other volumes and it'll make your martial arts smarter, faster, and more explosive."
3,"Great pictures of Bruce, written for kids.","I could only give this book 3 stars because Bruce contradicts his teachings now and then. Most of the techniques are simple and straight forward, however, sometimes he'll throw in a kick to the face when it would be dangerous to do so. It makes for a good picture and that's what I like most about the book. Most pages have 2 or 3 photos of Bruce. Even in photographs I love to watch him perform. He was a great martial artist and all his intensity and expertise show through in the photographs.The book is laid out in a clear, easy to follow format. Beginners will get the most out of it. For more experienced martial artists, enjoy the pictures.Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed"
2,OK,The brow band is cheaply made I will not use it I had to order another one somewhere else It was rough and put together so cheap I wouldn't makemy horse where it
4,Gridiron greatness,"Masterful. For any college football fan, this is an awesome collection of quotes by America's greatest (southern) football coaches. From Bear Bryant to Vince Dooley to more of the South's best, it's filled with uplifting/surprising quotes about this century's greatest game. Southernfootball.com rates this a must buy."
5,Great Book!,"This is a book for people who enjoy funny books about real life (oh yes and a bit of magic). Andrew is the undiscovered hottie kind of person, who is smart, sweet, athletic, and pretty unique. He has had a crush on MacKenzie (another supersweet kind of person) since forever. The eighth grade dance is coming up soon when Andrew finds a Genny the Genie. All Genny has to do is get MacKenzie to like Andrew, simple right? But what happens when Genny takes matters into her own hands and tries to hook up Andrew with his super-cute friend? Do things go haywire when Andrew's friends ignore him? What about when Andrew actually starts liking Genny?! This funny book reminded me of real life. A totally messed up love connection cuts through friendships and life, but then sews itself back together with something extra special. Read this book! It is #1!"
1,Returning Order is A Nightmare,"Superior American 5300030 24"" Clear Stair TreadPicture on Amazon website is not product shipped. The company claims no responsibility for this. Have tried unsuccessfully an entire week to return shipment. Company will not email me, as promised, shipping label needed to return it so that I will not have to pay. The three different male customer service reps, who all suspiciously sounded like the same person, were all very callous and seemingly disinterested in solving the problem as to why UPS had not generated the label they had requested at least three times.(so they say) FIRST time I have EVER had a problem with an Amazon vendor. I am now working with Amazon to get this package back to the company so that I can receive a credit on my account. Beware of ordering from this company if you are accustomed to excellent customer service!!! I only rated this one star because I had to in order to proceed with this."
4,a touching story,"It is clear that Esposito is a therapist because there is a lot of talk about therapy in this novel. And she throws a lot of issues--cancer, family relationships, career, friendships, romance, incest--into one little novel. But, somehow she makes it all work. Jessie and Rose have a compelling friendship/relationship, and the friends and family that are in their lives are also interesting. Most refreshingly, Jessie's father isn't depicted as the big, bad wolf. He's just human like the rest of us."
3,"Pretty good, but not up to her usual standerd","It was okay, but I don't think we really got enough with her (Daja's) students. I mean, I thought that the whole point of this series was to introduce new characters, new students. And I think that there was too much about the fires and not enough about Daja. And Frostpine, I thought that this would be a good chance to really develope him, a process which was started in Daja's Book and never really completed. I really did like the parts where she was with other mages. The interaction between Daja, Sandry, Briar and Tris and older people has always fascinated me. This book seemed to be as dark as Shatterglass, but this doesn't have Kethlun, so it's not as good.But I still love T.P.'s writing."
4,"agree with above, but i hated the tone","It is a great survey book of some amazing cities. I tend to agree with what has been written. But just a word of caution, Tung's writing style will start to grate as every chapter ends with somewhat of a flourish. I think it detracts from his obvious love of cities and preservation."
1,useless product,"this product did not perform at all. the first thing i tried to slice was a tomato,it was turned into mush.then i tried a potato, it jammed in the blades.finally a carrot,nothing. the blades were totally blunt. to add insult to injury i was obliged to pay return shipping. take my advice it is not worth it."
4,Roleplaying in the 'Verse,"I have recently acquired the Serenity RPG and am pleased with the writing style and contents of the book. The only thing not included is a blank character sheet. The rules are step-by-step and easy to follow, as role-playing games go. I would recommend this for any Whedon fan."
4,Good Source Material,"I read through this book at my local gaming store and didn't buy it. I didn't buy it because the rules are clunky and dumb. They put a lot more thought into the setting and flavor of Firefly/Serenity.Having been a fan of the doomed little series Firefly, and enjoying the heck out of the movie Serenity, I think I will go back and pick this book up for the setting. Its fun, its deep, and rules can be changed.I personally plan on using D20 modern and D20 future for the platform from which I plan on unleashing reavers, crooks and the alliance onto my friendly neighborhood game-geeks."
5,Large Green Squeaky Bone,I received this toy for my dog very quickly after ordering it. He loves it so much! There are 2 squeakers in it and he is absolutely nuts for squeakers! I would definitely order from this supplier again!
5,Perfect Halloween book for little kids,"A great Berenstain Bears easy read. My little three year old was reciting it in no time and she loves the fun illustrations. When we get to the part where it says, ""One with the shivers!"" we wiggle around and pretend to shiver. Both my kids (3 and 1) love this book. I like it because it's fun for Halloween, but not overly scary for these little toddlers."
2,"Could be worse, but...","I'd avoid this book.There are so many better books you can buy (with CDs), that there's no reason to buy this uninspired CD-less exercise book.It is a Hanon so you can use it to develop endurance and mechanical technique, but it's drudgery. I recommend one of Hal Leonard's Styles series -- Blues or Rock and Roll Piano--or even better, Learn Boogie Woogie Piano by Davey and Poloney.My copy collects dust."
1,THE WORST MUSIC SOFTWARE I'VE EVER OWNED,"I purchased this software from Comp USA, Ridgeland, MS. The store is nowclosed. When I loaded the program in it had no sound. I own more than adozen music software programs. Also when I went to register the software,they responded back, it could not be registered. I have the serial numberand the VIP code needed to register it with. It has sense enough to pullthe serial number out of my computer. All I needed was my name, address,email address, and VIP Code. If I could rate this product on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate it at -100. I have some great music software but this is not one of them.David DifferentBrandon, MS"
1,Is this vendor NUTS?,The retail price is totally wrong. I could get it for cheaper from another vendor.
1,Horrible cheap product,"This is probably one of the most overpriced cheapest of cheap products you can buy. For $34.99, this cheap piece of plastic comes with extremely flimsy cleaning attachments, 4 AA batteries (which were dead out of the box). No rechargeable batteries! Very flimsy. Do not buy!"
1,People with problems - Mostly sad soap with few highlights,"Not lighthearted, playful or funny or whacky as expected.Often on the twisted and abusive side with few revealing sexual scenes, but cute well figured girls - Plots bland and mostly disconnected with being a nurse."
5,Third World Cop,This is a very good movie. A must have for collection. It shows so much about Jamaican life in the inner city.Only wished it was encoded for DTS.
1,Terrible actor,"I love British mysteries and detective stories. This story was OK except for the lead actor he is the dullest,corniest British actor I have ever seen. He ruined the movie by his presence."
5,"A great product, that I am surprised is not available in stores","This is a great product. I live in a rural area, with a well water source for the house. However, the well water is subject to contaminants and bacteria sometimes, so we opted for bottled water. This system works great. I've been using it for about 9-10 years and it has worked flawlessly. However, in her hurry, my wife forced the wand on our system out of the bottle, cracking the tubing. It was not able to be repaired, so I ordered a new system. The quality and workmanship is excellent. This machine lasts a long time. I have bottled water pumped to my refrigerator, ice maker, and a 'drinking water' dispensing faucet on my kitchen sink. Works great. Great product of very high quality."
4,Great introduction to a complex subject,"The subtitle, ""Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Integration Dysfunction,"" is misleading: it assumes the average reader goes in understanding that Sensory Integration Dysfunction is the diagnosis, not a description. There are multiple, complicated, neurodevelopmentally-based dysfunctions related to how a child integrates all the sensory data received and processed. To grasp that range, I recommend another book after a reader finishes this one. ""The Churkendoose Anthology: True Stories of Triumph over Neurodevelopmental Dysfunction."""
2,a poor job on the characters makes this book a bad one,"This was the first book that I read by Faye Kellerman, and probably the last one too. When I read the synopsis on the backside of the book, it sounded really promising. However, the characters (terry and Chris)were so badly written. First of all, they weren't very believable, nor sypethetic. And I'm sooooo bored with these sweet,innocent, suffering and beautiful catholic girls. And what was that about Chris' penis. The auther must have a thing for big boners, why else was it so well described? I know this book was meant for women and I also know that sex sells, but come on! If I want sweet catholic girls and boring love stories, I prefer Virginia Andrews."
3,digital pen ???,can I get the refill alone without new pen ? I already got a digital pen.. why do they sell it again ?
3,Heavy Racket with some spin,I bought this racket for its spin but did not realize how heavy it was compared to all the other rackets had had used in the past. Had to return my initial purchase because the handle started to split open after a month of usage.
2,"Not as ""easy"" as it looks","The instructions that come with this are terrible. It took my husband and I 20 minutes to set it up. Putting it away was even more challenging. It has a really strong chemical smell that did not go away, even after several weeks. I would recommend keeping your puppy in a crate or buying a child's playpen as the previous reviewer recommends."
3,So-so,"I am actually quite disappointed with this comforter. It makes this weird ""all-the-down-is-wrapped-in-plastic"" noise. Every time we move, this plasticy-shrink wrap noise sounds off. It is quite annoying. It is also not cuddly like our queen size comforter. Picture is very deceiving. Too bad, 'twas a great price!"
5,Outstanding performance,"These plugs were smartly priced and a direct replacement for the original plugs in my 2002 325i. After 1,000 miles, they still deliver great performance and fuel economy."
4,Excellent guide to France,"I used this guide while traveling in Paris and plan to use it in an upcoming trip through the Riviera. Their tips were insightful yet witty. With this book I found a really nice hotel which was quite cheap - 130 francs ($22) a day for a single room. Follow their advice and splurge on food, the French take their food very seriously. However, don't follow the advice on exchanging money at the American Express office. Their rate is horrible. A better suggestion would be to exchange US cash at one of the exchange bureaus on the street and compare rates. Their 'security suggestions' regarding places to use caution at night were a bit excessive according to my French friends from Paris. Their maps of Paris could have been more substantial as they only covered a few of the arrondissements in great detail. Otherwise a great guide to France."
2,What is new? Where is the emphasis?,"Here we go again. Another edition of the same book, without any significant additions or more emphasis. Yariv mostly puts together parts of what he had published decades ago in this book. He pays little attention to pedagogy and does not care to put connections between concepts in different chapters.I could not find a spirit in the book that ties concepts together. Yariv jumps from one notation or symbol set to another without giving you any notice, which makes me think that he was more concerned with putting together his notes in a book format than trying actually teach you the subject. Publishing essentially the same book as another edition just adds insult to the injury.Do yourself a favor and check out some other book on the same subject, such as Verdeyen's Laser Electronics. Or if you have to buy it, save yourself a buck or two and buy an older edition used."
5,Excellent.,"Good rhythm in all the songs, very much ""Brazil"". Very soothing soundtrack to listen to, I would no doubt listen to this while relaxing in the sun on a beach or in my back yard. This is full of soft, sometimes jazzy, singing and acoustic guitar. Quite the Brazilian sound to it with a hint of techno in some songs. Every song was enjoyable."
4,Great Read!,This book is wonderful! Each character was well developed and easy to relate to. You will not be able to put this one down!
4,caveat emptor! no wma funtion,"Simple and inexpensive it does do the job rather well. I set it at 87.9 and it worked well in SE Florida metro areas from Ft. Lauderdale to the Keys; no interference. Also, I use it in-house with a power to lighter adapter and play music thru my stereo.It took me a bit to figure out why it would skip over songs, though; the reason: it does not play WMA encoded music...and that's why the 4 stars.The remote is a must for all these gadgets; trying to perform any function by pressing the buttons on the device, moves it and static starts. Just insert it in the lighter socket and use the remote to do anything else."
3,It's OK,This player is OK. I live in a rural area that is near a metropolitan area though. Because of this there is more bleed through than works well with this player. And unfortunately you're limited to the preset stations.
5,santa clause,"my kid loves it because she totally loves everything about santa clause,..it is a short enough book for the kids,..but long enough for them to read to at night"
3,from the back cover,"The rope or the Hellhole!O'Brien was a buffalo hunter down on his luck. The herds were thinning out, an hides were not easy to come by. But things got a lot worse when he rode into the town of Clancy, where he was greeted by a lynch mob, eager to string him up for a crime he hadn't committed.O'Brien managed to avoid the rope, only to wind up in Bradenton prison, a place know as the hellhole. The only thing that would keep him alive was his lust for revenge against the outlaw who'd framed him. when he was free, he'd track the murderer down and make him pay- in blood."
3,"Unexpected, but...","As I began to read this one, I felt like groaning aloud: ""Oh, not another one about a brave mom having to defend herself and her child against evil!"" In the end it is so only to a point, and the book ends up developing in a rather unexpected direction. Its ambiguous story (and dubious morality) would have been the stuff of a very good book, but the characters are flat and never seem to come across as quite alive, except the teenager Kara, who soon steals the protagonist role from her bewildered mother. The book is entertaining enough, however, which is no small feat."
2,It is what it is...,"It's an uncensored version of the show, but that doesn't say much for what it is. The show is pretty terrible in my own opinion, but it is exactly as promised. As per the WMVHD format, it played well on my computer (2.4GHz board, 64-bit AMD processor, 4 gigs RAM, 128-bit video card)."
3,Look for another map book.,"This book is just okay.The thing I dislike is that the maps are very hard to read and the way they are annotated is very confusing.Fortunately, while in Spain, my friend who was doing all the driving had another map book in the car from which I was able to navigate."
1,un tested,"Hi! Have not put it to the test, will be also taking a GPS. What more can one say about something one has not yet used. mavis"
4,good low cost camera,"I have owned this camera for about 3 months and I am very happy with it. It takes great shots and is easy to operate. The menu is easy to work through and covers everything. Using the max resolution, I have been able to print a 8x10 photo with good results. The only problem I have found is taking pictures in a low light situation. The camera has a difficult time focusing in the auto-focus mode. Overall for the price [$$$] at the local store I am very pleased."
4,"Great camera for price, but not the best","This is a decent starter camera for the price-- the software is useful, and the pictures are crisp. However, this camera is relatively large and eats batteries (4 at a time), even with minimal LCD use. The lens cap keeps falling off and is not as convenient as a slide cover (like the Olympus Camedia D520, which I now use). I would recommend another camera like the Olympus or the Canon Digital Elph for the more active point-and-shoot person."
4,Excellent Sounds and Insight,Mana has a keen insight to the plight of the native Hawaii'ans. He has put together insightful messages with a good beat. I especially like the beat and message of 'They Couldn't Take the Mana'.
5,Excelente CD!,"En este genero de pop Latino, el cantante Colombiano tine canciones muy bien logradas, mis favoritas son: ""Senales"" ""Todo lo que yo"" ""Vienes, me ves me vences"", Recomiendo mucho este CD que ademas de la espectacular letra, su musica nos deja muy satisfechos, de verdad lo recomiendo"
2,A Mediocre Medieval,"I've read some of this authors regencies, but this is my first medieval by her, and I was disappointed. Everything here is tired and predictable, an overbearing hero and a damaged, saintly heroine, yawn, yawn. The research seemed weak as well, more like an old Erol Flyn movie than genuine hisotrical fact. If you want to give this a try, buy used."
2,Crabby,"Well, it is just a typical Harliquin book. Not much to it. Margaret Moore is a good writer, jut she is too limited with the Harliquin books."
1,Works great .... SOMETIMES.,"This works so well when my husband opens it up shakes it and gives it back. Then 2 days later it skips steps again. I try to walk 10,000 - 12,000 steps a day. It is so frustrating to go on a long walk and find out zero steps were counted. This happens all of the time. I thought it was just a defective one so I went to Target and purchased another one. The new one worked well for 6 days and now I back to the same problem. I DO NOT suggest purchasing this peice of JUNK."
1,Terrible product,"This pedometer doesn't work. It records steps randomly, usually not recording steps at all. I would not recommend this product."
3,Good resource for seniors,"This book, written in a very simple, ""self-help"" style, seems to be geared to the senior citizen suffering from chronic illness and emphasizes developing and implementing management plans for exercise, diet, and medical care. While much of it is common sense, it does offer bulleted, structured outlines for communicating with medical professionals, managing medicines, planning for the future (and possibly greater physical degeneration), and most of all acknowledges the feelings and depression that often accompany chronic illness."
3,Not really what I expected,"After reading all of the reviews on this book I was expecting it to be a lot more intriguing than what it was. Everywhere I read, it was given glorious reviews. I guess I was expecting to find it as captivating as everyone else apparently did because I tend to agree with Amazon's customers 99% of the time. I guess this is the 1% where I don't.The book was OK, but it is not one for my keeper shelf. It was, at best, a one time read."
5,Artist Still Playing With His Food with Amuse-Bouche!,"Teasers as warmup course, or appetizer feast, here is consummate surreal gourmet providing the inspiration with about fifty recipes composing sections on: fish, meat, fowl, veggies, sweets.This continues his strong past of imaginative food with stylish twists of humor and fun with food. Try the likes of: Fish Cakes (salmon cupcakes with dill mashed potato icing); Cocktail Dates (bacon-wrapped parmesan-stuffed dates); Cowboy Cookies (chile-crusted tenderloin between carmelized yam slices); Inside Out BL's (bacon, arugula, and goat cheese sandwiched between fried tomato slices);Knuckle Sandwich (nutella, hazelnuts and sauteed pears on toasted pound cake).Add to all this suggested menus, brief primer and notes oon frying and advance-prep ingredient handling, and suggested menus.This is fun food, more lighthearted but serious food as well along the lines of Gale Gand's ""Just A Bite"" or her partner's Rick Tramonto's ""Amuse Bouche."""
3,Best use for these spark plugs,"I have found these plugs to work well in my Porsche 928 s4 with Petrol as the Fuel, but it seems to be a different story with my other car which is an Alfa Romeo GTV Alfetta 1982 model which I have run on LPG / Petrol for a number of years. I originally used Gold Lodge four electrode spark plugs which the car ran well on them, but when I ran the Bosch Platinum x 4 she simply didn't like them. Off of idle it developed a slight miss and it ran rough idling. I suspect the centre electrode is simply to tiny as that seems the only thing that makes sense after having the gas mixture checked and that was spot on. I Think it shows that the LPG has a need of a big Fat wide spark to ignite the Gas mix. This is only an anecdotal report and would need to be repeated on a number of LPG vehicles. I went and checked with a friend who has fitted LPG for years and he confirmed that with LPG he found that over time they found that conventional NGK plugs worked best. -- Cheers, John"
5,Sophisticated and rich with the aura of Paris,"Like Paris, the newest novel in the Aimee Leduc series is complicated, elegant, and lush with pleasures. I've ardently followed this series from the start. As always, Paris herself is a leading character (and the history of France is too); unlike other popular writers Black draws a Paris very much like the real one, of wealthy aristos and struggling immigrants, refinement and poverty, where past and present mingle with comfortable familiarity. We also are given more and richer insights into Aimee and, in particular, her partner Ren. I am loving the way Aimee, and Black, are developing. This is the best Leduc Detective yet."
3,ok movie,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! At least three people get beheaded and it is very graphic, only for older audiences. I don't know the details of ww or her powers but I know anime and I know rip offs. The main antagonist Ares looks identical to the antagonist from the first ninja scroll. I didn't like how her powers fluctuated through the movie at one moment she is strong and another she is weak. But the action and story kept me interested and it is a nice addition to my anime collection."
5,Loved it! But not for kids :(,"I just watched this movie today and I absolutely LOVED it! I am a big WW fan and thought this movie had a great story, beautiful animation and the right comedic timing! The fight scenes were amazing but VERY brutal! Chopping heads off and overall sword fighting would be WAY too much for little DC fans! My 6 year old son has seen other ""PG-13"" movies (Iron Man and Transformers) but this was a little too much.LOVED IT and hope it leads to it's own series!!! It's time for a little DC girl power. Batman and Superman have had their own shows, lets get WW on scene!"
3,Mostly Battle Worthy,"Visually, the animation looks great on the Blu-ray version, clear and crisp. I thought this was an excellent retelling of Diana's origin story; it starts out with a bang, and it really establishes Diana's character and her universe. The only criticism I have is that personally, it took a long time for me to warm up to the Steve Trevor character, so it made many of the early foundational scenes with him drag. I really felt his character sucked the life out of half the movie. Once the pursuit of Ares really got going though, it was exceptional. I especially like the personification of Hades as a sort of Roman Jabba the Hutt."

4,"Warrior, Hero, Goddess","There have been several ways Wonder Woman has been portrayed successfully in different media: as a Warrior where she is driven by honor, duty and a drive towards excellence, as a Hero where she is driven by societal values and the wish to help others and as a Goddess where she is motivated by more spiritual values that transcend the self or society. This portrayal of the character is between that of Wonder Woman as a untried Warrior and as a fledgeling Hero, which is natural since it is an origin story. It makes absolute sense that she is not portrayed as the full-blown and developed 'Wonder Woman' because at this stage she isn't yet, that is who she will eventually become. This is the story of her starting off as a Warrior and by the end of the movie beginning the path of a Hero."
3,"Good, But Not Great, At 3.5 Stars.","It is a good movie, but the story telling gets overrun by the excessive violence, which is unnecessary anyway. The extensive violent scenes, such as the opening scene, breaks the flow of the movie and makes it questionable for family viewing. Anyway, it is worth seen, at least once."
2,Not a good one,"I've admired Bruce Timm's work now for many years. His work with Batman, Superman and the Justice League was simply outstanding. Unfortunately for me his work that follows has been marginal. I think so far the Justice League (New Frontier) movie was the best but Superman Doomsday and now this effort have fallen short of my expectations. The Wonder Woman story for me was marginal although it was interesting to see the take on the backstory. The plot of the movie seemed to have been written by writers stuck in their adolescence. It all wraps up with a battle in DC which is just ludicrous.What made Batman TAS and the other shows so different was the depth of the personalities, attention to the story, unique character designs and backdrops. This effort falls very short in all those areas. The animation was stiff and most of the characters, particularly Trevor looked flat and unappealing. Hopefully the next effort will be better."
5,MXL V67G Review and Video Unboxing,Length:: 4:37 MinsThis video explains about each recording equipment product I got from amazon which save me money.If you looking to do some vocal recording with your instruments whether it be from guitar to drums or piano I totally recommend the MXL V67G its is perfectbut all the equipments came seperated on a affordable budget of $166.75. As soon as Istarted using the mic I felt like I was in a recording studio.
3,Mmm...,"I'd been waiting to watch this movie,and when I finally got it into my dvd player, I was kind of disappointed. Basically, porno with puppets. A lot of talk about cocks, drug consumption, puppet sex. Kick ass idea, but got overshadowed by puppet porno. I like what the director talks about in his inteview on the inside sleeve, and found it more interesting than the movie. If your not thinking for yourself already, I don't think this movie is going to open your eyes and free your mind."
3,The plot's been lifted...,"This plot is the same as Aldous Huxley's Ape and Essence, in which from a post nuclear dystopian world emerges new ideals, when a man discovers a movie script entitled ""Ape and Essence."" Live Freaky: Man finds Helter Skelter in a post nuclear dystopian world and new ideals emerge. Tim Armstrong's awesome though, so I don't hold him accountable for borrowing the plot. At any rate, I don't feel like writing a real review, so tell Amazon it wasn't helpful."
1,sansa,"this is a piece of junk. I used it for one day, and then stopped working. I didn't even get a chance to upload any songs. I only used it one day to listen to internet music."
3,Only 3 stars!,"Good:1. Nice sound quality2. Internet radio3. Rating options (on the mp3)5. Skip songs on Internet Radio (unlimited)6. Good video quality8. Nice click wheelBad:1. Short battery life2. Simple setting options3. No sleeping timeI bought it from the seller ____ (And the seller puts the product in the ""New"" section). If you want to know who they are just click ""All my review"", you will see who I purchased the product from. The box of the product is white (like the used one). There is ""No Wifi"" label on the box of the product. I had to contact Sandisk Customer service to solve the problem with the internet radio (because there is no internet radio until I downloaded a new firmware and did a bunch of things). Eventually, the most important thing is that the screen is scratched 2 long lines accross. Very frustrated!I hope this information is useful to you!"
1,waste of money,"This purchase was waste of money. File transfer to device directly (folder to folder) is almost impossible. Used Rhapsody or VMP to sync up MP3 files it only does for dozen MP3 and then crashed! It was much easier to drug and drop files to SD card outside of player, but when SD inserted to Sansa, the initiation process take a very long time and player cannot be used for 15-20 minutes. Battery life is very short. Wi-Fi is nice but it tied to Yahoo and that is dead already. I simply junked this device as it cannot be use for what I planned. Don't buy it!"
1,David Cassidy only bright spot,I only bought this movie because David Cassidy was in it (he gets the star). He was the only good thing in it. He was a parody of his 2 former TV personalities. He played such a jerk and I found myself laughing at his outrageous behavior. His believability as such an arrogant jerk tells you what a great actor he is!!!!!!
3,Received correct model number but not the color as advertised on Amazon page.,"Thought I ordered the clear plastic model as displayed on the Amazon page. Instead I received an all black model. Works OK, but I thought I was going to receive the color of the pedometer as shown on the Amazon page. This ""Review Your Purchases"" shows the type I wanted and thought I ordered, but did not; somewhat deceptive advertising."
3,Sportline Model 330 Step,I like the pedometer overall. What I don't like about it is sometimes when I walk it does not register. I have read and followed the instructions.I also thought that it would give a calorie count also.
2,Sportline Model 330 Pedometer Review,I purchased 22 of these pedometers for a walking club at my work recently. They have been used for 2 weeks now and already 5 of them have stopped working correctly or have broken. I used one of them with my better pedometer to see how close they were and they track fairly well. I would say they track about 10% more steps then my more accurate pedometer does.They just do not last well at all. They should last longer then 2 weeks.
5,eiht's best 1 in years,"my favorie eiht cd in a while I love how he raps on here talks about the streetlife about hoodrats, hustling, going to jail getting caught in gunfire the typical eiht cd love this tune compton ain't going nowhere igf you're sick opf the mainstream stuff go west weay undergrounsd."
3,Too vague,"Some very good information , but very vague on a lot of subjects. It would be nice to have more pictures and details of subject matter I have yet to find a really good electrical book other that the NEC CODE BOOK"
2,HEPA filters,"The filters are the incorrect size and don't fit my canister vacuum, how do I return these?"
4,"Works fine, only received 1...","I, like others apparently, ordered this believing it was a package of 2 filters based on the product description. Only one filter arrived but it did have a sticker with '2-Kenmore HEPA Filter #86889' on it. Contacted Amazon and they said because it was from a third party (With them fulfilling the order) they couldn't send me another but would give me a 50% refund. Some have said they have gotten both filters, others like myself only 1. Clearly Amazon has an issue with their supplier here and should clarify the number of filters included with this product.Other than that it fits and works fine in my Kenmore vacuum."
2,"Started clean, Ended Filthy, and Dirty","This movie started out with a good concept, but ended in very vulgar and dirty style. This movie did not represent the Indian people very well at all, it showed their lack of self control and moral values.I do not recommend this show at all! Dont waste your time and money on this."
5,Better than the movie,I enjoyed the series much more than the movie. I'm sorry to have seen it cancelled. What do networks know?!
5,outsourced - outstanding,"Witty , made me laugh until I cried . Never knew what to expect . Truly entertaining. Wish there was more episodes . I was sad watching it, knowing that I was coming to the last episode ."
5,A Tear For Judas,This book was in excellant condition and the arrival time was fast. I will order further products from Amazon.com. Thank you Amazon.com
3,Very difficult to teach from,"After surveying available undergraduate texts in astrophysics and consulting colleagues, I settled on this as the best available despite qualms about its size and cost. My students are finding its size and sheer length overwhelming; we are forced to leave out so much material that they are questioning whether it's worth it. The system of units used (cgs) is becoming (if it is not already) obsolete in most areas of astrophysics. In every chapter there are references to material yet to be covered, requiring one to flip back and forth, often over hundreds of pages. Finally, with a 1996 publication date, much of the material is becoming dated (I know, a new edition will be even more expensive).All that said, there are remarkably few errors in the text, figures, and problems for a work of this size. The instructor's solution manual is clear, comprehensive, and generally correct."
3,Not my favorite.,I didn't like this book very much. I do know many people who thought it was fantastic.
1,Rusts in under a month,"I have been storing the hammock stand in my garage when not in use, and its already showing signs of rust. Overall the metal appears to be cheap quality and the paint just flakes off. I contacted the manufacturer and their response was they are not responsible for paint."
5,TOP QUALITY,THIS HAMMOCK STAND IS OF TOP QUALITY. THE STAND IS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND IS VERY STURDY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO RECCOMMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE WHEELS THAT YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR STAND. THIS MAKES IT EASY TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
2,Not truly TEA glasses,"I received these as a gift. In America a TEA glass is usually 12-16 oz glass, as I see now the product description does not say what size they are. so I was surprised to get a small 4 oz glass. They are pretty just not the size I was expecting."
3,4 teaspoons?,"At the recommended four teaspoons per serving I think this would be pretty overwhelming. I use about two and get a chalky aftertaste, but not all that bad. I actually prefer International Delight Cinnamon Hazelnut, but that is a refrigerated item and obviously can't be shipped easily. You're buying a lot of creamer here and this deal may be better for an office than a single person home... but it will keep and will add variety to my coffee drinking."
1,"Shoddy, hollow, and crushed","This block was thin and hollow, not solid at all. The sides were so thin that they were already crushed when the block arrived in the mail. Do not put any weight on this block! It's very dangerous. Do not give it to a child to use."
4,Good guide for the licensed therapist,"Aimed at licensed therapists, this book makes you feel like you have your own business coach sitting alongside you. It is a well-written guide for the licensed therapist who is looking to improve his/her practice or change it altogether within a related field. - Cris Walker Roskelley, MFT, Author of ""On the Road to Becoming a Successful Marriage and Family Therapist: An Insider's Handbook From Graduate School Through Licensure... and Beyond!"""
5,nikon n 75,"absolutely, totally, satisfied. better quality than the very expensive digital cameras. I was going to buy an expensive digital camera, luckily I tried my old film camera and then bought the Nikon n 75"
2,Nikon N75 Battery Compartment Cover a poor design,"Battery cover is very poor design and can easily come apart. A metal plate is attached to the plastic door with small plastic studs. If the studs sheer the entire door needs to be changed. Parts are hard to find, and the repair instruction manual are hard to come by. Authorized Nikon repair shops charge more than the cost of a new camera."
2,"La reina del merengue,lol......","Personally I'm totally disapointed about this CD,I thaugh that I would be more more merengues in it.If you just like merengue don't buy Olga's CD cause there are JUST about 4 merengue songs and some peepz still call Olga Tanon ""la reina del merengue"",lol....I can't wait until Gisselle CD comes out."
3,Be careful of edition numbers!,Be careful the edition number of the Study Guide matches the textbook! The questions in the textbook change with the differing editions.
4,Great To Have,The solutions/study guide was a great help. I would definitely recommend picking up this supplement if you need to buy the accompanying text.
2,"Good, if you need a riot shield","The case is well built, but it's really too big. Plus, there is a very large translucent piece of plastic affixed to the top of it (*not* shown in the picture, coincidentally) which is entire unnecessary and just adds to the bulk of the thing.There is a strap, if you are trying to sport the kind of look that repels members of the opposite sex.Finally, if you have a screen protector for your PSP, the unit won't fit in the case with the protector on it."
5,good product,"very good quality product provides the shock resistance necessary for 1000 series PSP. I have taken this device on deployment with marines, survived the harsh environment without harm to the PSP."
4,It will be a great gift for my son.,I am giving my son a PSP which he has been wanting for a couple of Christmas'.This will help to protect it well.
4,Bulky but protective,"Really, I felt my Playstation Portable was perfetly safe in the confines of this device -- worth every penny."
3,Missed it by just THAT much!,"Item arrived fast, but it wasn't correct for my use. The Amazon description says it is a #4-40 tap and #43 bit, but I received a #6-32 tap and bit. Close, but not what I wanted to buy."
5,Must have for McLeod's Fans!,I have not taken either McLeod's daughters CD's out of my car CD player since I got them.They will really have you thinking about when each of the songs were played during the series.If you love the show McLeod's Daughters and the music on it buy this CD and Volume 1 while you are at it!
4,Garden Soaker Hoses,"I found that soaker hoses in 3/8"" X 25 foot lengths to be non-existant in southern California, where I have lived for over forty years. I was trying for months to find 3/8"" X 25 foot versions. Could not find that size. I had just thrown away two good 5/8"" x 50 foot soaker hoses because they damaged my rose plants and other plants when I moved the hoses around. 5/8"" X 50 feet is too stiff, too long and too hard to coil up when finished. So, I settled for the 5/8"" X 25 foot one from Amazon's affiliate. Other than being too stiff due to the 5/8"" diameter, they are working as designed. I do doubt that they will last as long as the warranty unless it store them away from sunlight and not use them. If I can find 3/8"" X 25-30 foot ones, I will buy them and toss these."
4,It's alright,I have skin allergies and i HATE the scented stuff. So this works well without being all oily. The pump works well too so there's really no complaints! It's a lot of lotion in this bottle!
5,very good for the price,I have very sensitive skin and can't use products with fragrance in them this lotion makes my skin feel silky and soft when i put it on my feet and heels you can notice the difference.I think it's a great buy for the price i will continue to purchase it as long as the price doesn't increase there isn't another product that work as good as the lubriderm-tried many others not satisfied.
1,Buyer Beware,"The ignition module arrived on time, however as the one ""real"" previous buyer noted, it did not have the plug ends and/or boots installed. I've replaced similar modules on other Kohler engines with Stens replacements and have never run into this before. When I contacted Stens customer service, I was told that the Stens replacement module for this engine does have the ends and boots factory installed. (Just as I suspected) For my order, this company used a photo - copyrighted by Stens - and shipped a piece of chinese garbage. If you buy one of these POS, don't forget to buy one of theseAccel 300+ Crimp Heavy-Duty Tool 170036M. In summary, my review is: ""This part no like original - no even assembled - it no work at all"""
3,Sufficient Body Exercise Machine,"The Ultimate Body Press Dip Stand was easy to assemble and was put together in less than 5 minutes. The construction is not perfect as it sits slightly unevenly on the floor. Adjusting the plastic octagon grips on the bottom has helped, but it is still not quite right. The foam grips feel thin and I suspect that I will be either replacing them or will be wearing gloves very soon. There are 2 angles on the Ultimate Body Press Dip Stand. A wide side and a narrow side. The width of the machine can also be adjusted for variant angles of the same exercise. The Ultimate Body Press Dip Stand is as advertised and can fit assembled under a Queen-sized bed. Overall, I'm happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone needing an exercise machine that doesn't take up much space assembled or disassembled."
5,no savings on amazon?,this product is actually cheaper on the ultimate body press website. i find that strange. i usually come to amazon to get a better deal.can anyone explain why i made out better on the offical website?
2,Not a value,"I could not get this to fold and decided to return. I really needed to be able to store it while not in use and felt that at the price it should have folded easily and smartly. I did not find that it assembled easily. It is hefty, but as another reviewer stated it doesn't sit evenly on the floor."
1,Build your own better and cheaper,"It amazes me that companies still try to build and sell equipment like this for such a ridiculous mark up. With a few basic tools and minimal skill you could build your own out of heavy duty plumbing pipe that would be much sturdier and cost less than half as much. This probably cost them a few bucks to manufacture and might be worth $20, but definitely not what they're asking for it."
4,eclectic mix of music,"I bought this cd after hearing a bit of it on NPR. I was blown away listening to Ah! Mes Amis, and wanted to hear more. I am dissapointed that there aren't more songs like that on this recording, but find it enjoyable to listen to anyway. My infant son enjoys listening to this as well."
3,I wanted to like this after reading the reviews. I didn't.,"This must be a lot more fun for the people who've seen them on TV or in person. It's clear they are fine singers and great entertainers. However, as a newcomer to their work -- just listening to the CD -- I really thought this fell way short of my expectations. Rather than a charming blend of musical styles, I found it a mish-mash. I kept wanting to hear the ""real"" thing in any of the genres they performed, and aching to pull out one of my other CD's as they glossed over various styles. I can deal with ""lite"" compilations sometimes, but this was too ""lite."""
5,Roof Rasing and Rafter Shaking 101,"Now THIS is what I'm talkin 'bout! Where have these guys been?!? Why haven't I heard of them? I came across this CD an immediately liked the concept. Three black tenors, black men in a musical worle where you don't see many of us. I bought it out of curiosity and out of a desire to support it, and I was 100% glad I did. It's worth buying for the ""70's medley"" that start's with ""Love Train"" and ends up with ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" (though they only sing the Pips' parts) alone, but the stirring ""Make Them Hear you,"" the rollicking rendition of ""Let the Good Times Roll"" and the wondrous version of Nessun Dorma just make it that much sweeter. If you want to hear the breadth and depth of black American music celebrated by three immensely talented performers, you owe it to yourself to get this CD. There's something here for EVERYONE."
5,Loved how these looked...,"I had no issues with these candles at all. They were easy to install/turn on etc... They looked really nice from outside the house, flickered like real candles. They are not super bright - but I like that - if you are looking for bright candles these are not them. I really liked them though. They turned on at 6 and off at midnight."
3,ok for the price,"I like the dress, although the material is alot thinner than I expected. I was hoping I could wear it out, but I wouldnt feel comfortable it being so thin. But ya for the money it was a good purchase. Just wish it was thicker."
4,Kettler Favorit,"This is my first rowing machine and I love this thing! I read all the previous ratings from people on this item but decided to buy it anyway despite some of the negative comments. Yes the box was torn up on delivery but no parts were missing. It was not difficult to put together. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, 3 to 5 times a week. The computer on it works fine even though quite a few people have commented that theirs didn't. Although all measurements are in metrics, but can be easily converted on line if you're really a numbers watcher:-) The previous comments about clicking noise it makes are true although in my case it's just the plastic boot that covers the connection on the rowing arms.I usually have my i pod on while rowing so it doesn't bother me. I think this was definitely money well spent!"
1,Lighthouse book,"A lot of the information is outdated or just plain incorrect. There were lighthouses that were in the area that weren't in the book. Because it was outdated, some of the lights that were listed weren't visible due to tree coverage, etc. We did like having GPS coordinates, but sometimes they sent us further away from the light than what we could find on our own. It's a somewhat helpful guide, but use it cautiously and do your own research also."
4,A children's book that will also touch adults,"Everyone knows the Teddy Bear is named after Theodore Roosevelt, but most people don't know exactly why. This fanciful story is half political and half a fairy tale. I don't mind reading it to children because it happens to be true. The illustrations are beautiful. The total effect is enchanting."
1,Not For Posture Support At All,"For a back support, it might be okay. But for posture support, this product's straps are too far in toward the neck to assist in any posture improvement. Product went back to Amazon.com the very next day. I added a picture of the front of the product to help the consumer see how the item is designed from both sides."
2,Not comfortable at all!,I gave it a shot and it was very uncomfortable to ware. so I could only have it on part of the day.
2,"this experienced writer writes like I would, poorly","By my count this is Anne Edwards 27th book, you wouldn't know it from her writing skills. I agree with the 1&2 star reviews, save your money unless you've got to have every Diana book because this one just repeats everything we've all already heard and doesn't do it well. Moira Johnston, who ghost wrote Trevor Rees-Jones book, would've done it better."
4,Not Happily Ever After,"This is one of the best of the Diana biographies I've read. It's easy reading, yet goes into more detail about her family history, her childhood and her dysfunctional family. One can understand her need for love and acceptance after knowing what she went through growing up and also understand why she feared she would lose custody of her children the way her mother had lost custody of her, her sisters and brother."
2,LPJ's Letdown - Música Pa'l Pueblo,"I realize I'm at a minority here but this second CD by Locos por Juana does not begin to do their talent justice. Their first CD was a work of art; I truly believe these guys to be musical geniuses; they were great in both instruments (strings, keyboards and percussion) and voices; even the funny, spoken comments left at the end of some of the tracks added flavor to the project.In Música Pa'l Pueblo they added trumpets and I don't know what else in almost every track, giving their sound a sort of boring, watered-down version of their original. If you like very slow Reggae and ""Norteño"" style music this is the CD for you (""Norteño"" seems to be the music of choice of Mexican youth now-a-days, just watch the Univision network one morning and see what I mean). This CD does not have a fraction of the energy or variety of rhythms of the first one. Even the cover design is crappy. Very dissappointing. Hey, but that's just me, what do I know."
5,More than I'll use!,I needed reminders for my fairly minimal use. Phew! 738 pages of info Plus the helpful 39 page index! I'm quickly finding my needed bits and pieces. There is more there than I'll ever need or use. I highly reccommend!
1,Blah!!,"This has to be one of the worst Fear Street books I have ever read. The main character is such a loser. There was little suspense, no horror, no death. Do not read this book."
3,Didn't have a great suspense!,"I would have to say that this wasn't the greatest book but it wasn't the worst! The book started off good but the ending was a total give me! I can see how some kids relate to the popular crowd, but to be in the crowd doesn't take you that extreme! But, all in all, it was a good book to buy!"
3,For the Aficionados,"This novel is a last in a series, and established fans who come to get their fix of Hoke Mosley will not be disappointed.I came to it first and I liked the believable characters and compelling descriptions. But ... not much actually happens.The undercover assignment is set up, but then as soon as Hoke arrives at the place he blows the guy away and beats his sidekick to death - and that's it! As for the cold case subplot, Hoke achieves a breakthrough by claiming it's solved and panicking the guy - couldn't he have done this any time in the previous three years? Finally, the released revenge-promising con is made to buy a place across the road from Hoke just to rid him of Ellita, as it seems.And what's this about an Orthodox Jew with his favourite brand of tuna?I think the book needed a careful editor."
4,I liked them,"dislikes: a little too much cocoa flavor that kind gives it a little hint o' bitter chalkiness and OCCASIONALLY a little soapy taste (i got over it)Likes: they're Kosher and Organic. I could not taste the dates, thank God. I enjoyed the brownie like texture and the predominate coconut/chocolate flavor(as the name suggests). it's a good size bar which makes the glutton in me happy. There's a bit of an oily residue on the bar that seems to bother some people but it truly blesses my heart.I would definitely buy the coconut/chocolate bars again and will probably try some other flavors too."
1,Never again,"I was impressed with the list of all organic raw ingredients of these bars, but the taste is bad. I won't buy it again."
2,Too oily,"I love coconut, but these bars are so oily they kinda feel gross when trying to eat them...they left oil on my lips. Taste..was a little bland but not bad once you get over the really greasy feel of them.Unfortunetly I wont buy them again..and will keep looking for a coconut one that is less oily, the larabar one was good..but I am having a hard time finding them again..the coconut cream pie ones."
3,Good Price but looks cheap,Bought this ring for my wedding becasue the ring was well priced. It looks cheap next to her other ring. Very little stones.
5,Ring,I'm not a big jewelry guy but this is a beautiful ring and my wife loves it. Well worth the price.
2,One of the Un-funniest books ever published,"Perhaps the concept is a bit thin to begin with--essentially, a book of unconnected jokes on pop culture from the fifties to the nineties. The humor here is barely college newspaper level, from cbeap wordplay (""Cabbage Patch Adults!"") to just plain obvious ... Sending up pop-culture is a national pastime. You have to do a little better than this to warrant putting out a book."
2,Talk about a one-joke idea . . .,"""Rough Draft"" is amusing for the first page or two, but it quickly becomes stale and repetitive. It's basically one joke repeated over and over and over. It reads as if the writers made a list of pop culture icons, shouted them out at each other, and then shouted out the first incongruous ideas that popped into their heads (""Mister Rogers!"" -- ""Tank top!"") Very few of the ideas are clever, witty, or chuckle-inducing."
4,Excellent Fantasy Trip,"""The blue, peaceful death...."" from these opening words, I find myself transported to another place, another time. Another WORLD!I do agree that there is some lacking characterization at the beginning. However, the plot itself is compelling enough to keep the reader interested. By the end of the story, the characters have been beautifully painted through their actions as much as their descriptions.Like the old saying goes ""Anything worth having is worth waiting for.""Or perhaps ""Good things come to those who wait.""Whichever you prefer, you'll likely enjoy the journey into this young author's imagination.Fantasy is not something I'm usually interested in. For a writer to keep me glued to my seat is quite an accomplishment. Oliverez has accomplished that. I can't wait to read more from this talented, imaginative young writer."
4,Decent racquet,"Chinese style is usually 1 side unless said otherwise. Basically, I like this racquet. It is a little too light for me but the description said so, so not a problem with the racquet itself. I feel this is for fast attack style play. The edge where you put your thumb & index fingers are not smooth, however."
1,Slowest low budget movie ever,"If you are looking for an exciting movie, I would not recommend this one. It's one of the most painfully slow movies I have ever seen."
4,Sound Healing Introduction,"This book gave me a great introduction into the world of sound healing and the various theories behind it. If you are musically minded then you would probably get more from the book than I did about the physics of harmonics but my lack of ability of understanding of how it worked didn't detract from the fascinating introduction to this topic.The book covers ancient uses of harmonics, the science of harmonics, the various spiritual uses of harmonics in chanting and such like and exercises to create your own vocal harmonics or using vowels as mantras. I've been using some of the sounds from this book in my healing practice and they have proved to be very powerful.An amazing book from somebody who knows their stuff and loves their work.Totally recommended."
2,Basically a rehash,"I found very little new here that has not been written a dozen times beforehand. Although the title could lead a person to believe that this book is about the British and their strategy in the Revolutionary War down South, this is a bunch of battle histories strung together without a lot of analysis of strategy. John Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE is a bit better than this one, and mcuh cheaper!"
2,Hmmmm.,"Well I have been a fan of this series for many years and have watched each episode over and over again.....except this one. After watching this episode for the first time I felt like the producers of the show were busy watching ""Shaft"" or something in that genre to come up with the downhill skiing scene, not to mention the horrible 70's film overtones throughout the episode already. C'mon, any fan of LW&C would feel sick to their stomache when viewing this episode knowing it was the last. But on a good note, buy it to complete your series hehe, it will look good on your shelf."
3,Not the right rubber as advertised,"The rubber is pan-asia not felxtra. If you are happy with pan asia rubber, its ok. Flextra gives much better spin."
3,Good for beginner,"This Racket is very light.It's easy to handle.But I wanted thicker wood pannel. This is so thin. That's why It is Light.This is reasonable price. Now, I'm used playing with."
1,not what I asked for,"I thought that I had found the perfect gift for my mother.The description provided was not what I got. When I received my package there were two problems. First, the storage box that I received, while still very beautiful, was not what was pictured nor as big as what was pictured. Secondly, I received no flatware. I immediately called and a new set was sent to me. . same problem...wrong box, no flatware. So I had to send them both back and can't even get the item because no one knows why the error kept occuring"
3,Against the go to sleep club,"I'm way too old for beginner books but I read ""I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!"" anyway. It's good for young readers, but against the go to sleep club. It focuses on ""Keep your eyes open so you can READ!"" soooo much that it fights going to sleep. And what sense does ""Reading with my eyes shut is bad for my hat and makes my eyebrows red hot!"" make? They should say it's bad for your eyes but no, they say it's bad for your eyebrows and hat. And it would be terrible for Russian Blue Witch because she LOVES books toooooo much to pay attention to the world around her and help people. It would be better teaching going to sleep because I never let my sisters sleep, chattering stories all night. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
4,Hypocricy rules,"If you like their music you should have this dvd.It has 2 parts: first is the 1998 concert with 11 songs,and the second part have 6 videos.It last 90 min.the only problem is that it's in stereo."
4,Fuzzy fleece,"Bought this for my grandson who would NOT wear a hat to school. He loves this as he doesn't think he looks like a geek. I love it because it is warm & practical, also well made & long lasting."
3,Not high quality,"Low quality materials. Seam that stitched the band together is clearly visible, not very fashionable. Warm but not comfortable to wear for extended period. Don't get this if you have a big head, a tight fit.Look somewhere else for a quality headband, this won't last long."
3,Over priced,"Works fine, but is the exact same thing as the Behringer Cable Tester CT100 that only costs thirty bucks. Other reviewer must work for Ebtech."
2,Not what it's made up to be!!,"This unit is not as powerful as the description says. Instead of 165 mph blowing it's more like 90 to 100 mph. Vacuuming is also weaker than expected. I have oak trees that have little round spires, this machine picks them up and they stay in the vacuum fan flying around(you can hear them). Then when you turn the engine off they all roll down the chute on the ground instead of going in the bag, this is at full throttle. The feature of switching from vacuum to blower is very convenient but when the machine does not perform well, it takes away from the unit overall. The unit is also a bit nosie and with a 31cc engine I expected it to perform much better."
1,my mistake...read t/c's before your purchase online,"Simply put I purchased this tool for my 80+ yr old father as a gift but when I realized that he would be unable to operate the product efficiently I thought I would retun it. To my surprise I use unable to return the tool because I didn't read the return policy regarding gas powered tools. Obviously my mistake, don't let it happen to you. My only wish is that I would have been prompted with information about the return clause before submitting the order. It would seem to me that it wouldn't be too much to ask."
4,Good Recording,"Since Nelson Freire was included on ""great pianists of the 20th century"" selection, he has been one of the biggest Stars on the ""classical music showbiz"". It's totally waste of time to discuss if here is talented or not. With no doubt he's a gifted pianist who can walk comfortably trhough the most difficult pieces for piano.I'm very fond of Chopin studies, and since I began to study piano I've been listening lots of recordings : Arrau, Berezovsky, Cortot, Guiomar Novaes, Ashkenazy, Pollini, Martha Argerich, Magaloff, Kovacevich, amongst others...Freire's one , with no doubt, is amongst the most valuable in terms of musical_understanding and tone...The only negative comment I would like to register is regarding Freire's TEMPO. Sometimes I think that he could play more carefully (doing things better on muscial phrases, for an example) instead playing so fast...Both Barcarolle and 2nd Sonata are very-nicely played.Regds.,Roberto."
3,"Book is good, no CD-ROM was included as advertised","I bought this book new directly from Amazon, and although the cover profoundly states that the book includes a CD-ROM with examples, there simply isn't one. Another student in my class who purchased the book new also had the same issue.The book itself is good so far, although it could actually use a new edition since it refers to multimedia PC specs that are 10+ years out of date as well as speaking of things like the Internet in very antiquated ways. Not a big deal obviously and certainly better than coming out with a new edition every year to rip off students."
2,Not Complete Series,"Have some of the series in Blu-ray, such as Brazil, but these are only about 43 mins. No where does it say they are edited. Save your money and buy the country separately. They have some extras, but still almost half the footage from the originals are missing."
2,Disappointed to find that these are only partial episodes.,I was disappointed to find that these are only partial episodes. I guess I'll keep my eyes open for a re-release with the full episodes.
5,"May be an older book, but still totally worth having in the collection!","I use this book as an inspiration for a couple of Astronomy Lab classroom assignments for a college level course. The book may not be the most current book out there, but it has some great introductory reference materials that incorporate well in an intro lab class. I love this book!"
1,Don't waste your money,"My 9 year old daughter finished this rip off in under 4 hours. I didn't believe her so I checked it out and I finished in less than 3 hours. The game does not allow you to explore anything - strictly tunnels to follow with no deviation to anything fun. It had potential, but the developers restricted game play to such a small area that it takes away all the fun. Just follow the path and win the game. Don't waste your money or time."
4,Learning about Belize with a laugh...,"I really enjoyed this book. Without even noticing, I learned about the country of Belize and the Mayan culture as the author creatively wove historical details into a humorous, touching account of his own journey. I found myself both sympathizing and laughing with him as he tries to learn, and keep up, with the ins and outs of an unfamiliar culture. I became quickly invested in the main character and eager for him to come out on top!"
5,excellent condition,This book is out of print so I was glad to find a copy in good condition!! It came in just a few days!
3,needs to work with kindle fire,"Needs to be digital!Amazing magazine, the only setback is that I cant read it on my kindle fire. There isn't even an option to request it for kindle."
3,"Good, but I'd like articles that are more fun and less academic","I've only received one issue of the magazine so far. With a name like ""Bark,"" I was expecting more stories like you might find in People Magazine, only for dogs. Canine interest stories, I guess you could say. Instead, I found the articles to be somewhat dry and academic."
2,FOR THE VERY RICH DOG OWNER,IF YOU HAVE MEGA BUCKS AND A DOG(S)? BUY THIS MAGAZINE.....IF YOU ARE MIDDLE CLASS AND LOVE YOUR PETS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN THEN PASS ON THIS ONE.
1,Magazine,I have orderd this but have not received any issues yet - how do you rate something they have not sent you? It must be 6+ weeks since ordered

5,"Olympus VN-1000 Digital Voice Recorder: excellent design, good controls, good sound; great value at under $50.","EXTRA UNADVERTISED INFO regarding the Olympus VN-1000: You can play/feed your digital voice files to your computer by separately purchasing an inexpensive generic 1/4"" male to 1/4"" male audio cable: Plug one end of the cable into the voice recorder's ear phone port and plug the other end to your PC's microphone port. Similarly, you can play your digital voice files through your stereo system if your equipment has an auxillary port."
5,"still have it, still use it.","I've had this for about 5 years!? It still works although I only use it on occasion. It records a bit of ambient noise, but if you only need to record a conversation or some notes, then it's perfect. Also, I would recommend not storing the batteries in it while not in use, as it drains the batteries. But even if you take the batteries out, and put them back in, whatever you saved is still there. Also, I love the lock button, so you can't accidentally play the tape or stop recording. This was before I owned an ipod, but I still use it."
4,Interesting,"I think you have to be into flying to realy enjoy this homemade movie, and since I am I found it interesting. The author lands at one airstrip after another and they get progressively shorter and more difficult. The views are pretty incredible of Idaho wilderness and mountains."
3,Decent jammers,"These jammers replaced a pair of my speedo jammers after I lost them in Greece.The material is the same as any other jammers out there, but the apperance is sharper. the fit is nice and snug on the waist and REALLY snug on the thighs. Although I do have to note that my thighs are pretty large because I do a lot of running and base oriented exercises."
3,Good looking bike but..,"I like the look and the quality of the bike, but the rims where not adjusted to have a smooth ride."
5,The Go-To Resource For Online Networking,"As a person that sidewinded professionally into the social networking and blogging space over the course of a couple years, I wish I had the Virtual Handshake when I started my journey because it would have cut down the learning curve by orders of magnitude. The book provides a terrific overview of online and virtual networking technologies through detailed accounts of personal and business cases from around the world. Having a personal online presence has never been more important, and this book can show business people why it matters, how it matters, and where one can go to get started (in more areas than most can imagine). I have the Virtual Handshake as part of the required reading list for new employees not only because it's the best concrete book on online networking in the market but also because I want people I work with to have a leg up in the world as individuals."
5,"Top notch, must read book!","This book is a must read for anyone that wants to increase their reach in the world, and be heard in the world. These two guys clearly outline the steps one should take to grow their trusted network and extended network, and they do it in a way that is easy to read and follow. Add to that, the information is dead on!Don Bell - (...)"
5,for 2006 maxima,"great product, a little expensive but it works great so far. I do have to hold the drivers side window button to keep the window from going back down, it might be a little to tight of a fit."
4,A handy tool you didn't know you needed,"I bought this because for the cost of renting a steamer for a couple days I could own one. We originally rented it to remove wallpaper, which is MUCH easier with a steamer. It did the job nicely, but was a bit on the small side.Being small has its advantages, though. It was easy to move around the house and easily stored.Having it around, you discover ways to use steam as a cleaning agent - fabric car seats, barbecue grills, tile floors, bathrooms, the dogs - OK, it isn't safe for them, but it is handy and well worth the investment."
4,"Good product, good price","Love the steamer, plenty of steam for extended period of time. Wish it had more/better attachments. Especially an upholstry/fabric brush attachment."
4,"Cleans wet stains, not hard stains","At this price this is what you get. The next is ladybug, which is more heavy duty, but $500 more expensive.USE: Cleans some spill stains in carpet, light stains, some sticky stuff between tile, no hard paint stuck between tile or on carpet, no sticky/burned stuff in kitchen. cleans but not some smudges on glass.Steam-cleaner smell (like plastic, not chemicals) stays maybe half day in house on first few uses. *maintains* a small house. 45 minutes steam allowance but breaks for reheating. Tiring to drag along entire carpet spaces, brush bounces against carpet.. Sound of steam coming out of the nozzle, ears 2 feet away from nozzle is loud but eh. Surfaces dry themselves in about 5 minutes.Recommend filling more water than needed to reduce need for water reheating."
5,Amazing Machine!,"I was anxious to try this steamer on my tile floors. Easy to set up, was up and running in minutes! Solid, well made floor steamer with many attachments. Trick to it, don't push so hard...let the steam do the work for you. The floor brush with it's pad glides easily, cleans very well. Nice touch, no special pads needed. With clip on mounting on the floor attachment, you can even use regular terry towels if you don't want to buy replacement pads. Definately worth the money! And, as always, easy purchase through Amazon.com!"
2,Doesn't Do Much!!,Only benefit I have found is using on grout. Otherwise it doesn't do a good job on much of anything. It is easier for me to do by hand as compared to setting up this product. Don't reccommend at all.
2,Disappointing,"leaks,not very hot,bulky impossible to store,no impressed at all, Keep looking everyone I'm an easily pleased person and again not impressed."
5,Wagner Steamer/Cleaner,"This product is a must in any home that wants and needs sanitation! We have dogs, chickens and a steady stream of visitors. The Wagner is easy to use and very effective. I do have to make mind of running out of distilled water in the machine and knowledge that it requires a cool down time etc. Be sure to read the manual and make mental notes on things that you don't normal have to make mind of. I purchased this machine after reading ALL the reviews - and I must say - if I don't read reviews, I end up with something inferior - but this is magnificent! Easy, fast and efficient. Cleaned floors, WINDOWS, doors, TILE, refrigerator (exterior), and the list goes on! Love it!"
3,Too Big,"I wanted to eliminate having to buy a floor upright mop steamer and a handheld one, so I purchased this. The product is way to big and takes up enough room as a vacuum. I also noticed that on the floor attachment their is no solid surface so the cleaning can be innafective. I sent it back and got my mony back. I will just be buying a floor steamer now."
5,So Pleased!,"This is my fourth steamer and I love love love this steamer. I am so pleased with the power, big tank, and flexible long hose. Down side is the length of the cord."
2,Power Steamer,In reviewing the comments on how much you can do with this product I must say I am a little disappointed. I thought I could use it to steam clean my outdoor BBQ grill. It did not do anything to the outside. I even sprayed it first with a cleaner. I also tried to clean the grills. I had to spray Oven Cleaner on the grill first & had to use one of the brushes to get it somewhat clean. I have no intention to remove wallpaper but did use it to clean the ceramic tile flooring in the kitchen. Decent job.Too much money for the job it did.
1,how bad is it? it's that bad!,"I can't believe I'm in the minority here. I can't believe I purchased this item based on all you positive reviewers vastly outnumbering the negative ones. IN ANY EVENT THIS THING SUCKS. The little red buttons that hold the thing together ALL break off after a few MOMENTS of use, sending little tiny parts flying across your floor. It's the cheapest mechanism I can imagine. You finally figure out some way to stick it back together and it just falls apart again immediately. Must be some kind of joke?Even for the few minutes I had steam, the only attachment that does anything is the tiny brush. Just imagine yourself scrubbing your floor with a toothbrush, then when it's done, start all over with real cleaning equipment. But the red button connector fiasco is reason enough to stay away.I have returned it, for twice the shipping estimated by amazon.com. Hopefully they will remit the full amount but who knows."
1,Extremely dissappointed,"Do NOT believe all the wonderful reviews about this machine. It is absolutely useless. I read all the great things people are saying about this piece of trash and was eagerly awaiting for it to arrive to get some serious cleaning done. Trust me, you're much better off just using one of the small hand held steamers than this thing. It does NOT clean a damned thing. In fact, I held the unit withing 6 inches of my hand and only felt a little warm. Before I actually used it, I was concerned about sopping up all the residual water like I did with my hand-held unit, but, OMG, what a joke. There's no residual water. Hardly anything at all comes out. The towel attached to it just barely gets moist, let alone wet. I WILL be returning this junk. VERY, VERY DISSAPPOINTED. Yellow really is the appropriate color for this LEMON. Either I got a lemon, or, there's some underhanded marketing guys planting a bunch fake reviews here, either way I got hosed."
4,An effective wet steamer,"I bought this steamer on the recommendation of my pest control officer as we are currently dealing with bedbugs. I have used it to steam my furniture and carpet to kill the bugs and as far as I can tell it's been very effective. I can't comment, therefore, on the uses it's intended for, like wall paper stripping. It's very easy to use and has lots of useful attachments. My only gripe would be that it does spit water, but under most circumstances I'm sure that wouldn't affect what you're doing. All in all very pleased."
2,not worth buying,I can make this very short the power steamer worked great untill all the plastic parts broke. When the handle broke it was the end of the line the unit was set out for the garbage.
1,"integrity, honesty","I received the game in a short amount of time, the game does not work in my new console..I wrote the company I purchased it from, they were very understanding, returned my payment and told me to keep the game and try in someone else's console..I will purchase from them again, as they did not even question my integrity, nor my honesty which makes them top in my world."
5,"Full Moon Classics, Vol. 1","Excellent selection of films, picture on all very qualitative. There are also additional materials, but it is a pity that absolutely have deprived of it film Shadowzone. I am happy with this edition."
1,Last Zenith Ever,Same problem. I have had my Zenith for about 18 months. 2 large yellow spots have appeared and are getting bigger. I contacted Zenith and they are unwilling to do anything about this even though it is an obvious design flaw. The TV is now worthless and I'll be putting it out on the street for the trash collectors to come pick up.I've had Sony products for years with never a problem. This is my last Zenith or LG product.
1,Never ever purchase this TV or deal with Zenith,"D52WLCD worked well for 12 months. Then 3 year bulb burned out. Then blue spots started growing across screen. Zenith will not repair or refund, after 12 months its your problem. It cost more to fix than to buy comparable new one. Parts take 3-4 months to obtain and are not Zenith any longer. See other reviews to recognize this is a common problem."
1,Did not last,"I have had the same problem as the other reviewers. After 1 1/2 years, developed blue spots in corners and now a big yellow blotch in the center. Repair center wants $1800 to fix."
3,Decent Game,"Ok Its another Dirt Racing game, Its not to bad.I would rather play Dirt Bag games they seem to be a little bit better to play."
5,Quirky Car Decoration,"Larger than most dashboard hula dolls, but it makes a statement in a great way! My friends love riding in my car, so they can watch my Hula Man shake back and forth. Buy it for yourself or as a funny gift!"
1,Don't Buy,This saw has a generic spark plug that is only good for one limited use. Plugs can only be found at company and are of high cost. Don't buy this one.
5,Great Printer for Photographers and Scrapbookers!,I bought this printer new and I love it! The print quality was amazing and the ability to print larger pieces was a great bonus! I used this for printing photographs and also larger scrapbook pages!You will love this printer!I will say the only down side is the price of ink...but that's the same with all printers!
2,A path of problems....,"This is my second B9180 and even though I bought the extended warranty it'll be my last. When I resolve one issue (printerhead cleaning, printerhead replacement, new ink, updated driver) another problem comes up (paper jam, paper not recognized, endless cycling). Because I am not retired, or wealthy, I do not have the time to babysit this machine. Nice prints though."
4,Excellent Printer,"The B9180 printer has proven excellent in printing repro digital prints of my oil paintings and pastels. I'm using Hahnemuhle art paper and the color is extraordinary. Using it with Photoshop, I hardly ever have to correct the colors, so I haven't wasted a lot of high end paper. Your investment will turn out to be more in the ink and paper you buy than the printer itself. I chose it over the Canon because Canon prints a wide border on the paper, and I wanted to have more flexibility with that. I can print without a border, and get buy with smaller sizes of that excellent but very expensive paper."
4,Good value for your money,"I have had the B9180 for several weeks now and it has worked flawlessly. It produces brilliant color prints and has worked on all the papers that I have tried on it. These include Moab, Red River, Hawk Mountain, Hahnemuhle and Ilford brand papers.There are a wide variety of paper profiles available for this printer, many on the Yahoo B9180 group and from the paper manufacturers. You can easily install custom profiles and paper sizes on the printer.HP supplies a Photoshop plugin which unfortunately only installs itself on CS2 (and I assume earlier versions). But there are instructions available (via Google) that show you how to copy the two files by hand into CS3 and once you do that the plugin works.All reports of tech support issues indicate that HP is very responsive to any problems that develop. All in all I'm very pleased with the printer so far."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!,"The worst printer I've every had, by far. Painfully slow. Jams constantly. Very noisy. Every time you bring your PC out of sleep mode, it pops up an annoying Status window indicating the printer is online, also pops this up randomly at times. I will go back to Epson next time."
1,"AWFUL, Expensive ink smears and it jams incessantly","I got this because it's supposed to make good prefessional prints, brochures, etc.NOPE.The ink is terrible with 8 seperate (and pricey) toner cartridges.It has not delivered quality at all. I would never give a client something this had printed because their fingers would be covered in ink. No joke.Right now, it's a really expensive drafting printer for what we give to the printer shop to make ACTUAL brochures.AND THE JAMMING!! EVERY FRIGGIN DAY!!!!!!!!!Advice: Don't put it in front of a wall because you will need to access the back to remove countless pages every day. I do.."
5,"FROM AFRICA, WITH LOVE","Kathy Hannah, an avid reader, November 19, 2004,An Educational Book!Expect to read FOLK TALES on why the tortoise's back is cracked, How IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD, The differences in HOBBIES between children in so called 'THIRD WORLD' countries and those in the WEST, EDUCATIONAL Hand-Me-Downs, CULTURE as it relates to Births, Deaths and Burials.....Then proceed to Herman's ARRIVAL in Philadelphia in Fall 1987...The CULTURE SHOCK...The FIRST WINTER of a kid from the Tropics...His SUMMER Odd JOBS, DATING in the USA {One girl he dated is said to have been: 'A christian by day, and a hypocrite by night'. How this author survived 13 CARS in 10 years, will amaze you. From Africa, With Love, is both educational and entertaining."
3,Tune-out Tunes,"The low price convinced me to buy this CD hoping it might be one of these rare found wonders. It wasn't. Like most soundtracks, the music doesn't seem to follow a particular theme, so it's not one of those CD's you crave listening to. The genre a music was a little to varied. A few songs were right up my alley, easy rock with a nice beat, but occasional parts hit me a little wrong. It's the kind of music that if it were playing when you had guests over, you would cringe and apologize for the music, quickly changing the CD and making excuses like, ""I found it in the parking lot, so it was free."" Though these points seem to be negative, I do listen to the CD once in a while, so perhaps it was a worthy investment. It's the CD I play when the apartment is too quiet and I need some background noise. The kind that can be easily tuned out as you go about your business. All-in-all, buy this one if you have money you don't mind spending and you like to have some noise in the background."
2,Could be better,"I had the same experience as the previous reviewers. The episodes skip, pixelate and the audio keeps dropping out. It has nothing to do with the DVD player (I have a modern, expensive, state-of-the-art one), this set was just poorly mastered. I was very disappointed considering I bought it for my father who loved this show when it first aired."
4,Riverboat,"I disagree with all these previous reviews. I have the Riverboat TV set and it is quite good quality. No skips, jumps or any of the other problems that the other reviews say they are having. However I'm using a good quality high end DVD player not a $100.00 low end players like most people purchase. People are having these problems while trying to play North American discs on modified Region 2 players and while trying to rip the original DVDs. I have now watched this set on 4 different Sony players, 2 Pioneer, 1 Yamaha and a Panasonic DVD unit and all the discs in the set play fine without any problems."
3,an unfiltered review,"It did its job but I've used better and cheaper polarizers in my life time, so good but not great.On ocassion I would have trouble mounting it on my cannon xsi dslr because the cannon's cheap kit plastic lens has to mate with hoya's metal screw threads. So this is more a dig at cannon."
4,nice,I like the fit of the bug flector the only thing I don't like is the plastic screws and fastners. A couple of the plastic screws were chewed when titening
5,Excellant buy of the year,I bought this item at 75 percent cheapier on your web site because it had a minor scratch on it. I couln't afford it any other way thanks for the opportunity .
4,If only it were louder...,"This is a great toy but the only problem with it is that it's far too quiet. It's supposed to say the name of the animal (and then make the noise of that animal) when you pull the animal out of the fabric-covered ""circus."" It's supposed to teach a child the name of the different animals. Unfortunately, because the volume is barely audible, I as an adult can barely hear it -- to say nothing of my 9 month old daughter hearing it. As a result, my daughter doesn't play with it as much I think she would if the volume level were louder. This company should learn how Neurosmith adds volume to its toys -- because they're far superior. (Be sure to check out the ""Together Tunes"" Toy Block by Neurosmith. Now that is a fantastic toy!) That said, I still think this is an adorable addition to my daughter's ever-growing collection."
1,total misinformation,"The author bases his ""facts"" on outdated myths and urban legends rather than on anything real about any of the groups covered. The chapter on TOPY is one large mistake from start to finish, obviously using information gathered completly from mid-1980's tabloids. This books reads much more like a Christian propaganda tract than as a real guide for understanding anything.Not only does this book insult the groups it is supposed to be about, but it also does an injustice to police officers who are truly interested in learning about these practices and to how best to deal with a situation where encountering them. Anyone looking to learn the truth about any of these groups or practices in an unbiased fashion would be well advised to look elsewhere."
4,She Tells It Like It Is,"Kim tells you what it really takes to make money in NWM. And she tells you what works! If you are a beginner, or if you have been around for a bit, you will enjoy reading this."
4,Well worth reading,"Joel Mowbray clearly has a point of view, but his reporting is solid. He exposed how our embassy in Riyadh had such a lax visa issuance policy that 15 of the 19 9-11 hijackers were able to gain entry into our country by clearly lying on their visa forms. That's a public service. At times, Mowbray is too monolithic in his conclusions about the foreign service, which has many well intentioned members, but this is an important book to understand how our diplomacy often veers from the best intentions of our political leadership. I say this as a former member of the State Department press corps."
2,author has an agenda,"some of the research is credible, but the conclusions in most cases don't follow the research. for example, the state department is consistenly blamed for actions undertaken by the defense department. why? also, many of america's arrangements with other governments are not examined in the context of the cost-benefit analysis as a whole; they are only presented in isolation which would make many arrangements puzzling and suspicious. given that, the question here is why did the author selectively choose which foreign countries to isolate?ultimately, the real question raised by this book is what were the author's motivations in praising the defense department and attacking the state department?if the reader is looking for a more insightful and balanced view of the relationship between the 2 organizations, i would recommend ""Kissinger"" by walter isaacson."
1,"loose language, weak Mathematics","There is no fixing for this book. pick any page, and Every other sentence is inaccurate or vaguep.216, ""...the thing we are measuring may have changed...""p.216, ""...each time we measure something, we are randomly selecting a different realization...""p.234, equation 68, he makes a change of integration variable, and gets it wrong."
5,Anson 2 review,"I have always enjoyed the history of baseball. Important to me is the texture of the game coupled with many descriptive life experiences of the players as crafted by the author writing with clarity and insight when explaining the begining defining our American culture. Cap Anson 2 provides a further development of Anson's eventful life at the same time the publication introduces the reader to Mike ""King"" Kelly. The breadth of Kelly's baseball and personal lifestyle gives the reader a rich and entertaining view of the Victorian culture's new American competitor. The author has written the book's content to appeal to the researcher, and equally important is the author's attention to the reader that can enjoy the richness of an interesting read. All who read Cap Anson 2 will enjoy the over 100 illustration throughout."
5,God's gift to candy,"These candy bars are wonderful. When I go to upstate New York I put up with 45 minute waits at the border (in each direction) just to buy this candy. It has a wonderful coffee flavor, and its very light. I wish they would market this candy bar again in the US"
1,"Zenith D60WLCD ""Buyer Beware""","I've had set for approximately 6 months, well not exactly. The local Zenith repair service picked up my set after 5 months of use. The lower screen developed blue, then green horizontal display problem. The local service has requested $2,500 in parts to repair, however the parts required to repair the set are not available, I'm told, until mid-February. No set for Xmas, New Years, despite efforts to press repairs at Zenith and repair service. Upon request, it takes 2 days for a supervisor from Zenith to return a phone call. I purchased an extended warranty but did not expect the problems or service levels I've experienced. Unfortunately, I can not rate any higher than 1 Star."
1,"unless you like blue and yellow discoloration, don't buy","This tv seemed like the best I could get for the cost at the time, and for the first year I believed that. Then, shortly after the 1 year warranty ran out my tv started developing yellow spots around the corners and eventually spread through the whole screen. Now that yellow has taken over blue spots have started developing in the same pattern that yellow did. The warranty is expired, and for the price quote I received to have my tv repaired, I'd be better off buying a tv of a different brand. This is obviously a manufacture defect as many others have the same problem, but why won't zenith correct their mistake? They put out a product that severly lacks in quality, and they don't stand behind their product and support their customers. Because of this they've lost me and many other loyal customers."
3,picture quality revisited and fixed,"In the U.S., use a three prong to two prong adapter on the power cord. It reduces/fixes ground loop noise in the video and the horizontal lines I saw earlier are now gone as far as I can tell.Many thanks to Craig!!!"
2,Very disappointed with this filter,This filter could produce very big yellow circles in direct or close to direct lights. It ruins many of my pictures already. Don't buy this. You should spend more on a filter.
2,"Ok, but not great","I'm not real impressed with this tuner. First, it's slow to pick up which string youre on. Second, it can't seem to make up it's mind which string it thinks it's tuning. Third, doesn't seem to want to pick up the low ""E"" string. Fourth, doesn't want to clamp on the head of my Ovation. It's better than no tuner at all, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's your only choice, or youre low on funds."
2,"Not too bad, but not good enough for me.","My old tuner was broken and I bought this tuner for my guitar. If you do not use the tuner very often, this tuner might be okay. However, if you use the tuner very often like every day, this tuner makes you frustrated because this tuner does not catch the pitch from your instrument exactly sometimes. If you try couple times, finally this catch exact pitch. I will not buy this tuner for next time."
5,Awesome Violin tuner!,"I was out looking for a tuner and the bad reviews of cheaper tuners lead me here. I was glad it did! This tuner is amazing, you can tune your violin even with lots of noise in the room! It's small, but that's okay, it makes it easy to carry around."
3,Not a Great Experience,"I bought this after reading reviews on the the various clip-on tuners. It arrived in a box that had the seal broken,so who knows, it may have been a return. It worked well in finding the proper notes, but on the trebles, it ""buzzed or vibrated"". I have no idea if this is normal, I saw nothing about it on any other reviews, but I found it unpleasant, so I returned it. If it had not buzzed, my review would have been 4+ stars. Please advise if this is a dysfunctional effect or normal, as I haven't ordered another yet."
2,skip this one,"First of all, the reviewer before me did not even refer to the correct book in her review. This book has nothing to do w/ there being 2 gods. She is refering to Dark Rider, another book by the author.That aside, this book is just alot of bickering and sex. Neither main character is especially sympathetic and Cassie's breasts had a bizarre tendency to swell every time she became aroused, which may have been useful in case of a shipwreck during the voyage from Hawaii to England, but is otherwise just annoying!"
5,Great Reference!,This book tells the history of jerusalem from ancient to modern times.It Is very Informative and has many photos and paintings that add to the text.This Is a good reference for any one who wishes to know about the world in which the bible characters lived In.
4,good reference,"I wanted a book to help me improve my SQA system. I bought this book with great expectations. It ended up being a great reference for the CSQE test, but added little practical value to my practical purpose. It is a general overview of several topics that include Quality, CMM, CSQE profile and so on. If you need a reference to study for the CSQE test, this is probably a good book for you."
5,Good times,"Hillstomp is a Portland, Oregon-based duo that plays minimalist, Fat Possum-style blues. Deft acoustic slide guitar and bucket-and-can percussion accompany ""sung through a telephone"" vocals. Most of the songs are funky and percussive, but ""Lucy's Lament"" brings in mandolin and group vocals for an old time music feel. What the Old Crow Medicine Show does for old time music, Hillstomp does for the blues - kick out the jams with refreshing energy."
2,Beware... this is not the first book with these characters!,"Though I finished this serial killer thriller, I simply never connected with any of the characters, and the plot felt rather predictable as well. After turning the last page, that lingering feeling of not quite being able to pin down just what I disliked so much about the book continued to bother me. After some minimal Internet research I realized that this was the third book in a series. I wish that publishers would market series books accordingly!! I would never have tried to start a series in the middle intentionally! That may explain some of why I never felt connected to the characters, but the disjointed and predictable plot just don't make me want to track down the first two novels in the series. I particularly disliked the narrator, and just have no desire to read another one of Philpin's books."
4,"dream fades slightly, but still worth a read","Dreams in the Key of Blue starts excellently, with realistic characters, snappy writing, and a definite edge to the storytelling. A retired forensic psychiatrist emerges from seclusion to teach a 'Gender and Violence' course at an exclusive women's college - whereupon, in short order, people start dying violently and horribly. The author is in fact himself a retired forensic psychiatrist, accounting for the credibility of his main character Lucas Frank, and the early part of the book is full of interesting crime history.The plot offers a few obvious cliches and the story eventually falls into them, ending up chasing it's own tail at the end, too much psychiatry and not enough forensics. Nevertheless, it's a worthy addition to the serial killer shelf. I'll definitely read more John Philpin books."
1,"Drawn to the cover, dissapointed in the content.","Author fails to follow up on the points he begins in the book. Then throws in a religious aspect indicating that we, just by our thinking and praying in a circle can change the things going on in this world. author does not really give us concrete tools to change anything. Much of it was hard to read and I felt a underlying tone of true paranoia and delusion coming thru in this writing. Don't reccommend this one to anyone."
1,Same reviews for all sellers,"It does not give me confidence buying from Amazon when the same reviews for a product are applied to all the sellers of the product. I cannot get specific information on the sellers' products to see if they are genuine original products, or ""equivalent"" products, whether of good or poor quality. Because there is no differentiation between the sellers and their products; and I am unable to make a fair comparison from the information provided or other peoples' experiences; I must purchase elsewhere."
4,Memphis Soul,"What can be said or written about Willie Mitchell that hasn't already been said or written? If you love Memphis Soul music, you came to the right place. His work with Al Green, Syl Johnson, Otis Clay, Ann Peebles, O.V. Wright, and the Hi Rhythm Section is some of the best soul music ever. This CD includes his solo material, Sounds a bit like another Memphis Soul band, the Mar-Keys (Booker T and the MG's with the Memphis Horns), which is about as good as it gets. I really loved Disc #2, which is cover versions of some soul classics. If you like this kind of music, then get anything recorded by Hi, Stax, Backbeat, or Goldwax records.....Another analogy I would make is that Willie Mitchell was the ""Quincy Jones"" of Memphis."
4,Standard Series now made in Philippines,"I bought this filter for $33 dollars thinking it was made in Japan. It is not, unless you get an older production. The picture on this Amazon listing is also not correct. It does comes in a blue box and is the standard series.Not sure of what to make of the filter being producded in the Phillipines, I contacted THK Photo, the company representing Hoya in the States. I asked them of this and whether this filter was inferior to the one made in Japan. Here is their reply: ""The green series has been discontinued, and the blue series (standard) is now being made in the Philippines. It is a higher quality filter than the green series, and still made with optical quality glass to the same specifications as the Hoya factory in Japan.""I gave this product four stars on account of the confusion. I have yet to use in my camera.....Gotta love outsourcing.R"
5,Great!!!,"Does what it says, have not had much time to play with it but so far does its job.Quality of build is good."
1,It is not accurate,"Intelli IMT-900 is not very responsive to input frequency change. I guess, just guess, this is because of too long the total sampling period.The low frequency is not measured accurately. Again, I guess this is due to the logarithmic scaling of FFT sampling freq."
4,Works OK,"as past experience shows, finding a good spot to feel the vibrations is tricky. But once (if) you find it ... good to go..."
5,The Lord's prayer answered.,"Finially we can picture the Lord's prayer answered,Matt 6:10. ""Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven."" Never was it an empty prayer and this book helps us see how it will be fulfilled. Moses in good league with Jesus, Deut 11:21 had the prayer on his lips. ""That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, As the days of heaven upon the earth."" Five stars for bringing this answer to all our prayers into sight. Praise the LORD!"
3,But are YOU sure?,"I was always taught and read that ""few are those that find"" not ALL.Because the path is narrow and few find it, plus you have to be born again.God is good, long suffering, and full of love for EVERYONE but we need to accept him, not ALL do.Please look into this, especially if you are going to base all of eternity on your belief that ALL are saved, without having to believe that God himself died on the cross for you, for your sins, so you could have eternal life. If ALL were accepted, this would not have been required.Please believe in the truth of the cross and not the lie of the devil."
1,Tis a pity...,"This work was transformed from a literary masterwork of philosophy and divination, over the past several centuries, into unspeakable piffle."
5,Does the job.,I bought this filter as extra protection for me lenses and that's exactly what it is doing. You can't go wrong with this one. ...and the price is great too. ;-)
4,Well written and concise,as a government employee i know where many of his points are coming from and knowing of the fbi agent in charge (now over a state agency) I know well that everyhting he has written makes more sense and is more likely than any of the garbage the government has produced.
3,The Restless Gun,The pictures are of mediocre quality due to the source and age. Very good to watch for someone who likes old TV and movie westerns.
1,terrible tool,"this tester is a complete waste of money...bought it thinking i was getting a bargain leak down tester... . this leakage tester is highly inaccurate and inconsistent and leaves much to be desired. the reading are completely unstandardized so you can base the result on other tests youve made. i have since machined my on using FAA's specs...for the casual user who doesnt need the numbers, just buy a valve holder to fill the cylinder with air...for the professional id recommend, maybe a Goodson, Thexton or Star leak down tester..."
2,Jet Jewelry,"I returned this book so I might not be a good person to review it.It was VERY expensive for a very short almost pamphlet on how Whitby England made it's Jet!I wished to learn about Victorian Jewelry, not about the factory....I don't recommend this."
4,HDTV Explained,"good information, be sure to see what edition you buy to ensure up to date information"
1,it is a pity that the sound format is MONO,"everybody can read that in the back side of the cover from this dvd is written ""sound format mono"" it is a pity that this dvd is in MONO"
3,Alright,The paddle is alright... Not worth the money.. It bites hard on players offensive spins if u don't give a good return spin. Struggles with control too..
2,Saw Palmetto-miracle cure?,"The Vitamin Shoppe got this product to my house quickly, but it did not work. I had studied that saw palmetto was good for hair loss,but all it gave me was a headache. I saw NO improvement in hair growth. I studied that it was good for prostate health and libido. Basically, it just made me have to urinate ALOT and reaked havoc on my kidneys. I will NEVER get this product again."
2,Lost order,It took almost a month the actually get what I ordered. I was charged for them the day after I bought them and heard nothing from the company for over two weeks... then it said it shipped... but a week later there was still no tracking number and no package. Very dissapointed in the customer service... at least I got what I ordered.
4,Walking Europe (Sierra Club Adventure Travel Guides),I have travelled part of the route described by this book. I found the information in the book very useful in planning our trip and in providing local information which made our travels on this route more enjoyable. The book itself is a good read for anyone who is interested in European travel even if not comtemplating undertaking this specific trip. We are now planning a second stage of this trip and are using this book as a significant reference.
5,Excellent for studying,I love this CD! I often put it in my personal CD player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as I study French. The music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing. Steven Halpern composes great music.
4,Nice case ... junky power supply.,"I have been using my Sonata II case for about 2 years now. I love the design, very sleek and nice on the outside. On the inside the brackets for drives are not tooless but I the security and ease of taking in and out are great. There is great air movement with just the 120 mm fan, not much more is needed, (I think the passive cooling duct work thing is junk and I don't use it, actually makes my temps a little higher.) Now the bad, the power supply is worthless, mine lasted about 1.5 years and then quit for no reason. Then I read that a lot of people were having problems with this particular power supply from Antec, so just be warned there is a good chance it will die. Last thing the lights at the front which are cool looking died, not a big deal for me though. So even with the bad power supply I recommend this case, because it looks nice, is built solid and very easy to use to make a great system. Just to be safe start shopping for that better power supply."
2,great til it explodes in your hand,"I had one of these for about a year and it worked great, then one day I used them on a stubborn caliper. Now look I'm no super human or anything but I went to squezzing this tool and the ratcheting mechanism completely failed in mid squeeze. It made a loud pop and my hand was numb for a week. so I'll say don't attempt to use this on anything that is going to resist your effort, but then if you did that, a pair of channel locks and an old brake pad would work fine. I recommendSir Tools (SIRST9020-KIT) AIR-GUN Pneumatic Brake Caliper Piston Compressor Master Kita pnuematic compressor if you must have one. perhaps,you want this one for actuated calipers anyway. if you don't want to get this extravagant maybe a pair of the scissor style spreaders."
5,X Box version,"This is a very good game, better than I expected.The Flash, Green Lantern, Woman Woman among others need their own video games. I like the cinematics very much."
2,Not enough instruction,"This video assumed that the viewer knew when to tighten the abs and when relax them. It just didn't offer enough instruction as she went through each exercise. Also, the delivery was distracting; it was obvious the instructor was reading a cue card. She reminded me of a third grader giving an oral presentation in front of the class. She was just going through the motions almost robotically."
2,For Beginning Beginners,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I think of myself as a beginner of Pilates and have purchased two books and three DVDS to get me started. I was hoping this DVD was just a little bit more for beginners than the other DVDs I've purchased, and I certainly liked the idea that this DVD offered choices in workout lengths, from just a few minutes to longer ones. For me, though, the exercises were not the least bit challenging, and when I decided to try to group several together, I found that I often had to repeat exercises I had just done. I think the introduction was informative, especially for people who have never heard of Pilates. The exercises, too, might be really good for people who are not only brand new to Pilates but brand new to starting a DVD exercise program. For those who are even just a little familiar with Pilates and the exercises involved, I would recommend starting with something a bit more challenging, such as those by Ana Caban and Brooke Siler."
5,Great Beginners Pilates,"THis is a perfect beginners dvd in the amount of material that is on it and how it gives you a couple of different levels of difficulty to work with so that when you learn the easier, modified versions you still have alot more to work out with. There is at least 2 -1/2 hours of different exercises by my count.Maggie is a very good teacher and I would highly recommend this"
2,Ambitious but dull,"Robinson's story is very ambitious and brims with a ton of detail. However, it's incredibly dull. These are a series of linked stories, each involving new characters (despite the thread of reincarnation ostensibly tying each story together). None of the individual stories is compelling--the characters are mostly bland, nothing in their lives is particularly at stake, and the alternative history aspect is an very minor component. I loved Robinson's Mars trilogy, but was incredibly disappointed in this book."
3,"Not a page turner, but mind-expanding nonetheless","""Sprawling"" is the best word for this book, applying as much to its prose as the immense subject matter (religion, politics, history).While I never felt compelled to read (both the ""plot"" and characters were thin), seeing these very foreign cultures more clearly was quite interesting, and there is a powerful lesson here that puts to rest the ""evil white man"" myth by showing just how brutal, ignorant, and human we all are, irrespective of our nationality and religion. The world is no better off for lack of evil white men and in many ways far worse.The wrap-up of just how Yin-Yang life is made this worth the read as well.That said, if you're looking for lots of explosions, witty banter, or emotional character-building and plot twists then this book is your kryptonite."
2,"great premise, poor follow-through","I thought this was a great premise for a book, but the execution was more than a little disappointing. There are just too many ways a civilization can change for anything to seem realistic. Just as the black plague was a historical turning point that ended European influence in this book, couldn't something else have changed the world the writer created into something completely unrecognizable? The world the writer created here seemed too much like the world we know today, with a different accent -- like throwing curry powder on a food to make it ""Indian"" or chili powder on something else to make it ""Mexican."" I did enjoy the earlier chapters, but they seemed more appealing on their own than having to follow the conceit of having them reborn over time. Getting familiar with the world was difficult enough -- to have to relearn who was who in the story was more work than I was prepared for."
5,A Book to Savor,"Robinson has given us a marvelous, engrosing, make-you-think book -- my favorite kind. Highly recomended."
3,A Difficult Read,"What if the Black Plague killed off Europe? That is the premise of this work by the author of Antarctica, Kim Stanley Robinson. The novel covers about six hundred years, and it certainly feels like it takes six hundred years to read. The main characters are reincarnated, so you get to follow history through the same characters over and over again. I found it hard to follow because of similar names, difficult dating system, and the general differentness of the world from our own. It's worth it to read at least once, but for me, once was more than enough."
1,Shame this boring book can't get 0 stars,"It's unusual for me not to finish a book, but I'm having a difficult time plodding through this one. It lacks almost everything. It doesn't have continuity of plot, except at a ruinous level of abstraction -- as if a story set in the Roman Empire had the plot ""Rome rose and then fell."" It doesn't have compelling characters; instead, there are a bunch of cardboard cutouts who go through their paces and, when there is any risk of one becoming interesting, KSR kills everyone off and we go on to the next incarnation. I'm a fast reader, but I've been at this book for almost two weeks, because I keep wandering off to read toothpaste tubes, cereal boxes, almost anything other than this. If I weren't downright stubborn I wouldn't be bothering to finish."
4,Very engaging and ambitious,I enjoyed this book a whole lot. The idea of how history would have turned out had Europe been wiped out is such a massive undertaking that I just had to read it to see what KSR came up with. The result is very ambitious and delightful in places. It reminded me so much of the Mowgli stories by Kipling at times. I think the fundamental drawback with this book is NOT the book itself but us the readers. I just didn't know enough history to be able to make a judgment on how clever the book was!
1,Same problem ...,"Same problem like the other reviewer mentioned ... You could install the bluetooth device using MS driver and use it for PDA sync etc. , BUT you can't setup a network .. Tried all options .. Might have uninstalled the driver N number of times .. same result ... Belkin support is not good .. THey provide solution in one line ""Uninstall the driver and reinstall it again ?"" .... They don't know that some people may not be knowing how to uninstall driver ..."
1,Cracking the Code,I will no longer do business with Amazon.com. I have not received package. It would have so much easier going to a book store. I'm DONE!!!
1,Pure Fiction,Very misleading ideas about taxes. No foundation for the theories presented. The ideas in the book are a rehash of old failed schemes to avoid paying taxes.
4,Great Book,I though that this was a very usefull book for climbing. I used it primarily for climbing Blue Mounds in Minnesota. It had the majority of the known routes but unfortunatley not all of them. As far as the rattings are concerned they all seemed accurate and route descriptions were also great. The photos and detailed descriptions made finding the routes very easy. I give this book an A
5,Caught Up In The Ladies Of Covington,"I was so ready for a book I could be swept away in and I found it in The Ladies of Covington Send Their Love! This was a comfortable, delightful read from the first page - reminded me of reading The Mitford Series. I feel I have known these women, I want to be with these women, and someday, I want to be one of these women. Such a fresh approach to the latter years of life! Young in spirit if not in body. A wonderful reminder of the role my women friends play in my life. Thank you Joan Medlicott for this refreshing book. I am waiting for you to write for us again!"
3,Editing or Typing sucks,"I am only one third of the way into this book and although I am enjoying the story I would not recommend the Kindle version since it is so poorly edited or entered, there are multiple misspelled or jumbled words which makes it hard to read. It's like a puzzle where letters are missing and you need to figure out the words without all the clues."
2,A disappointment,I should have read the reviews on this item; the 6-inch diameter listed is correct only if measured from exterior of handle to spout.
3,Brand new and already cracking,I bought this a few weeks ago and it is already cracking. I don't know if it is because of dry-rot or what but it still works.
1,"Another ""waste your money on"" toy from Mattel","I recently purchased the Hot Wheels Tech Trax Crash Chamber for my Grandsons birthday. It took hours to put it together, had to be ""just so"" or it wouldn't carry the car. NONE of the other Hot Wheels cars my Grandson has (about 50) would work on the track. The car that was sent fell apart and you have to order MORE to use the track at all. My Grandson got no use out of this set and was very frustrated. It was very disappointing. It's no wonder the price was so reduced. I won't be buying any more Hot Wheels cars or accessories from Mattel. Too bad, you used to be a good company."
4,My review of Traditional Knitted Lace Shawls,I found out about this book on one of the knit list that I belong to. It was highly recommended as a great source for shawl knitters or those that want to learn about lace shawl knitting.I have found it to be a great source for designing my own shawls as Martha Waterman has great imformation and lace knitting charts in the book. I highly recommend it to any one interested in lace shawl knitting or designing.
4,traditional knitted lace shawls,"The diappointed reader is Ohio may have missed a crucial point. Lace is very difficult to knit; one typo can throw off the entire pattern, ruining the design as well as discouraging completion of the project. I designed knitwear for how-to publications for over a decade, using charts and schematics for the benefit of the ""blind followers"" among readers, as well as non-knitting editors and typsetters. Charts are also international: the symbols are universal so you can interpet the knitting designs of any nation, and not be dependent on translations which could be faulty or unclear, at best. I hope the Ohio reader will reconsider her approach. Charted knitting has been used for years now, and it benefits both knitters and publishers to learn how to use them. This particular book is a real gem; the finished projects are heirloom quality."
2,"Some good information, but a lot of common knowlwdge.",This book repeated most info found in other books and was not very helpful. Many other books are much better.
4,good for beginners,I already knew some Access but knew virtually no SQL 7.0. This book was great for a beginner like me. I think I now know enough to be dangerous. The concepts were explained concisely and simply. I think I could tackle a hardcore SQL 7 book and understand it.
2,Unless you have teeny tiny ears..... don't buy this,"Sound is ok, but the ear pieces are poorly designed, too small, and squash your earlobes. Expect pain after about 10 minutes.They are 100% plastic. I broke mine trying to loosen them up. They look pretty ugly all taped up, but now they are loose enough to wear."
3,cracks and pops,"As many people have pointed out, be prepared for static and temporary loss of signal as you move around while wearing these. It might annoy you (like me) to the point of having to go through the hassle of returning them. I do find them light and comfy, and the sound is fine ifmost of the time. If you keep your head stationary you won't have any break in the sound. But if your head is perfectly stationary, do you really need cordless? My opinion: live with the cord if you can...until the technology gets a bit better... it will."
3,"Want more range! Get with it, Senny!","Superb sound on the RS 85. But can't mow 1/2 acre square and listen while mowing because range only good for about 1/3 of this acreage, more or less a square.How the hell do you expect me to become an audio cyborg?Clean out your ears, Senny; give us more range!!Thanks!"
1,"Great sound, cheap shoddy construction","The sound quality and performance of these headphones are great, but they last about 6 months since the headset is very cheaply constructed. I had one earpiece fall off after the plastic holding it together gave way after a couple months of occasional use. I taped that side up, but then the other earpiece fell off a month after that. ...Save your money and buy another brand."
1,worked great until . . .,"Good sound, lightweight -- but it stopped working altogether in just about a month. Now I have to deal with repair or return. Not such a good deal after all."
4,Excellent value,"Great radio. Small and fits nicely in your hand. Execellent range, but the only way you will get 5 miles if you are in a clear unobstructed area. The sound quality beats a pair of cobra900!"
5,I loved this book!,"I just started getting into Vampire fiction and this book was so amazingly good. I'm normally a fast reader, but I finished this in two days, I could have in one, but I had to do other stuff. I love the character of Meghann/Maggie. Before she was transformed she was a feisty, fun, independent young lady, and even afterwards too, although, she came under the spell of Lord Simon Baldevar. As in lots of vampire books, they go into the past to see when that vampire was transformed, and usually it stretches(like one book I read), but this one was perfect. I just loved it. I can't wait for the sequel. :)"
1,High Resistance = Low Performance,"The resistance in the keys is very high in this keyboard, especially in the keys that are normally struck by the pinky fingers. Very irritating for those of us who type with the occasional capital letter, and must constantly correct the capitalization because our beleaguered pinkies didn't press the stiff buttons down far enough. However, this probably won't be as big a problem to those who type all in lower-case.I finally gave up and bought a laptop style keyboard (even though the command key is in the wrong place), due to my intense frustration at having to retype constantly."
1,Horrible,"Much of the success of murder mysteries depends on mood. People who compare this series to Morse or Jane Tennyson are idiots. The actor in the lead role has absolutely no gravitas, the dialogue is childish, the music puts one in mind of the old ""Columbo"" TV series. Desperately bad all the way around."
1,What's that?,There are no subtitles or closed captions provided in thes product making it impossible to deal with the heavy dialect of most characters.
4,Good value,"These headphones do exactly what i want them to do! I hook them up to my computer and i can walk around the room with perfect sound quality. I can walk pretty far with really good sound, but once you get behind one thick wall, it goes really fuzzy. But if you just want to walk around an open house and listen to music, these are the headphones for you!"
1,I hate to tell you but these [###].,"Finding the exact right frequency for the headphones is a never ending task. I bought the cheapest and upgraded until I got to the most expensive wireless headphones from Sennheiser. The bass doesn't come through and they just aren't acceptable. I returned them all one by one and got the Sony ones. Great bass and good reception. Sony only has 2 chanels though so if a lot of people have them, it becomes tougher not to interfere."
4,excellent photography,"This dvd has the same themes as the other ""Visions"" discs. I didn't find the subject matter as interesting as some of the others, but that may just have been my taste in subject matter. None the less, I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in Scotland."
2,Cant help but it is soooo obvious,"I Read all the reviews and thouth this was going to be a treat. Man was I wrong. It was not one twist och plot development that didnt shine throut at least a chapter ahead. I love when writes expand their character and Coe does that mentally but when it comes to physical apperance it goes sour. All I know of Tavis is that he has blond strait hair and that Grinsa is tall and Broad chested for a Qirsi. And people are grinning ALOT in this book.Something else that boardered me was that ""SPOILER WARNING"" that the only thing that keept Tavis From confession during the torture was pride. I belived that pride was the first thing to go under these circumstances. My advice read anouther book because this I do not like."
5,A welcome contribution to deaf studies,"Meticulously compiled and expertly edited by Elizabeth A. Winston, Educational Interpreting: How It Can Succeed is a scholarly anthology of essays by learned authors concerning the strengths and weaknesses of the practice of educational interpreting for deaf students. The contributors are all experts in the field and include former educational interpreters, teachers of deaf students, interpreter trainers, and deaf recipients of interpreted education. Divided into three sections - once focusing on deaf students themselves and the language myths that surround them, one raising questions about the support and training that interpreters have in and from the school systems, and one considering suggestions for improving the problems facing interpreted education, and how to improve situations for educational interpreters. A welcome contribution to deaf studies and a critical assessment of the skill of educational interpretation itself."
4,GREAT!,"Excellent!This is 4 pieces of fiction by the top names in paranormal romance fiction! The J.D. Robb is a fun Eve Dallas short novella, Susan Krinard gets a new take on her werewolves, the Maggie Shayne offering is part 4 to her Witches trilogy Eternity, Infinity and Destiny, and the Laurel Hamillton is just plain Anita Blake brand of fun! This is not a themed collection so much as a treat for fans of all 4 authors- and a chance to get to know these series in short form. One of the best! I have read this several times and wish it was available in a hardcover ( not large print) to go on my keeper shelf - my paperback is worn out!Also recommended: Maggie Shayne Immortal Witch series: Eternity, Infinity, Destiny, Anne Rice The Mayfair Witches series, Karen Harbaugh The Vampire Viscount and watch her new vampire books! They are hot!"
3,Disappointed,"I bought this because I am a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton. However, I only read the editorial reviews, as opposed to the customer reviews (which I should have done). If I had, I would have realized that the portion written by Hamilton is identical to her bookNarcissus in Chains (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter: Book 10)which I have already read. I would have appreciated it if the editorial reviews said this.This is just a warning to anyone who is buying the book because they saw the name LKH. Save your money here and buy ""Narcissus In Chains"" instead, where you can read this excerpt and the rest of the story for the same price as this book."
4,Cleverly written humorous romance,"For laugh-out-loud entertainment, you can't get better than ""Capturing Annie"". Raised as a lad, Annie Bonny is a pirate's daughter with absolutely no idea what being a woman entails. The only life she has ever known is that of a pirate. But her captor, Sir James Noble Avery knows all too well that Annie is 100% female. And he is determined to bring out the woman in Annie, no matter how hard she fights. Annie will try his resolve, his patience, and finally his heart, but Sir James will tame his lady pirate or die trying.Ms. Wynn has engaging dialogue, multi-dimensional characters, and a storyline that keeps you turning the pages. A real find!"
4,Not for me,"Got this as a present for my brother. He really enjoys it, but no one else really enjoys getting shocked, so he usually ends up playing with it by himself or friends that don't know what it is."
2,A little credit please!,"I found this book to be so simplistic in the exercise department that it was almost insulting. They were not nearly challenging enough and so it made it easy to only do them for 8 minutes because if you had to do them any longer you might fall back asleep from the boredom. The eating plan is sensible and lacked the necessity for calorie counting which was nice. But yet again, he over simplified as if saying,""Well, since you need to lose so much weight that means that you obviously know nothing about nutrition so here's enough to get you by."" Overall, I think there has got be a dozen other books out there that are better for your body and based on what really works for gaining a healthier body than this thing. In other words, keep shopping."
3,"very basic, but good food plan","I need to lose 40 pounds so I ordered 3 Hour Diet and this book. The other book was good for me. This one is for someone who has never exercised and doesn't really want to exercise and just wants guidelines on how to eat. It does have high quality laminated, plasticky pages, (not newsprint) and that was nice. You can almost use it as a coffee table book. It also goes on endlessly about getting a support system of phone call friends, email friends, and just friends period to alert that you are undergoing this new plan and need help. I, for one can't do that, so I knew this was not the book for me. I was lucky to get my husband to not roll his eyes when he saw I was yet again trying something new."
4,Basic workouts for 10 min.,"It's a good large exercise book. The beginning has about 4 pages about nutrition. Then it goes into the exercises, which has written as well as picture instructions. There are about 3 level exercises. The first level starts with things you do on a chair or against a wall or standing. BUT they are all good, and not hard to do. I will use about 55% of the book because the next 2 levels require some basic equipments which I don't have. Like an exercise ball, jump rope, basic bar bell and dumbell. All of them with easy basic exercises. Then the end of the book has daily instructions as well as a picture summary of all the exercises."
5,Thought Provoking,This book is very small in size and very large in the thoughts it stimulates. I purchased 10 of these books for my friends going on a beach trip to celebrate our 50th birthdays. It was a hit - not only does it have beautiful pictures it has some well written text.
2,Cute Book,"This was a 'cute' book. More for a child than an adult. The book size is small measuring 5"" X 5"" . I was hoping for a larger book to display on a coffee table. The pictures, however, are wonderful as is the 'wisdom' in the book. The size was the only issue that I had with this purchase."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I saw this production of Giselle live at the Opera Garnier, and was by far not the only one who found it sub-par. Even members of POB management, talking amongst themselves, commented on how dull it was.Because of the hierarchical nature of the POB, it's generally the older ballerinas who get to dance lead roles, and Giselle calls for an Etoile who can lead the audience to believe that she is an innocent teenager. Alas, Mlle Pujol is incapable of making a viewer think she is a girl half her actual age. And as much as I admire Mlle Gillot (her dancing in Jewels, for example, is outstanding), she makes for an unconvincing Myrtha.Paul Connelly's normally competent orchestral direction lacks enthusiasm.I give the dvd one star for its technical polish, but as a work of art, it falls flat on its face. In this reviewer's opinion, the La Scala Ferri/Murru version remains the gold standard to this day."
2,Rock Stars pretending to be Punks,"Sounds like a bunch of tired has beens trying desperately to sound REAL. I was very disapointed when I heard this the firt time. Nothing original, just a bunch of rehashed old punk sounds with 90's main stream punk polish. ""Welcome to the End"" ... God I hope so!"
2,BEWARE...this is 1979 music...,"I purchased this based upon...it being a 2001 release. Yes, it is a 2001 release but the music is from 1979 and the vocals are in Swedish. Musically, there a few decent tracks but had I known this was from 1979 and in Swedish I would have definitely passed it up."
5,Left hanging! There must be more.,"I've thoroughly enjoyed reading all four books of the Jaran series over the last few weeks. I'll admit that when I started realing the first book, I was skeptical that it would start moving along at anything but slow pace, but when it did pick up, it took me with it. Wonderfully done! I hope to read more of the Jaran. The end of the last book left my heart feeling wrenched over Anatoly's marriage ending. I hope more is coming."
2,Disappointed,"Electronically, so far it works as advertised. Mechanically, it failed after slightly a week old. I am still wating for an answer from ID Vault, as to how they are going to resolve it. Would like an opportunity to again evaluate this product in 30-45 days."
4,ME SIENTO CULPABLE,"THE REASON I BOUGHT THIS SELECTIONS IS FOR THE LOVE SONGS. I MUST ADMIT THAT THE TRADITONAL SOUND AND THE SINGER'S VOICE MAKES YOU THINK YOU ARE IN THE PROVINCES OF MEXICO. I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS CD IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE ""BANDA"" MUSIC."
2,Its not all its sold to be,"I bought these things because I like wearing my brain bucket, and I leave for work pretty early in the morning. First of all, its like wearing those HD Vision ""As Seen on TV"" glasses that are not to be worn at night. Not only that, THEY FOG MISERABLY. I've tried wearing them loose, tight, and everywhere in between, I can't see anything through them. I want to return them, but its not a typical Amazon Return, Amazon refers you to the sellers return policy page, and it looks like its going to be huge hassle, I might just have to suck it up."
4,Does the trick!,"This pack does exactly what I got it for...it keeps my water from freezing, it's small and doesn't interfere with most chair lifts, carries a few snacks or layers if I need them. It even carries my skis/board. The only downside is that the zippers are a little cheap, but I haven't had any major trouble with them yet. They just may take a little extra effort to open/close."
3,Not as effective as hoped,"I bought one of these bags with the primary intention of using it for the hydration pack and insulated sleeve. Within 20 minutes of skiing last weekend in 20 degree or so weather, the water tube had frozen in the sleeve, no exposure to outside air...thus it was useless weight on my back. I'm sure for other activities the back is great..but if you are going to advertise it as a bag for skiing and boarding then it should perform better in cold weather."
3,OK,"This book was okay, I guess. I can understand where Parker was coming from but I think he kinda acted like a jerk. Also, why does Parker get books written with him as the main character. Mike and Tor never did! I love Parker, but I didn't like this book that much. Number 1, it was about eventing again and Number 2, it was mainly about how Parker was acting like a major snob like his parents when we know he's not!!!!!!!!!"
2,What happened?,"What has happened to these books? i mean first they were at jumping then back to racing. Can't they stick to one topic! This book ""Close Call"" was one of the most confusing ing the sieres! I mean first Parker and Cristina were together then they weren't. Same goes for Kevin and Meliane. what was also confusing was the end did Parker make the Olimpic team or not? All in all this book was ok but not one of the best."
3,A sports book for kids of both sexes,"Something seems to be bothering Jenny. Baseball has always been an escape for her and her eleven-year-old friends. All of a sudden, Jenny begins acting strangely, picking fights and arguing over close calls. Then there was the problem with the big kids, led by Jenny's stepbrother Billy, who chased them off the ball field by throwing rocks at them.Jenny's friends are determined to find out what is wrong so they can keep their after school games going. It just so happens that they learn about compassion and prejudice at the same time.Close Call is a sports book for kids of both sexes. The teams are pretty evenly co-ed and there is a balanced mixture of baseball action and interpersonal relationships.Much of the exposition unfolds in dialog and some of the chapters seem a bit too short and break off in the middle of a scene. It's a little choppy, but this might work to the advantage of reluctant readers who need to take a break."
5,Dylan and Katie are back! (briefly),"I don't know if you all noticed but Dylan and Katie were mentioned briefly in this book. Christina and Parker see Katie at the party, and Kevin tells Parker he saw Dylan in the flower shop earlier. I am glad the ""new authors"" have found a way to bring them back into the series. I also think it's good that Cindy is coming back, but we are still missing many other people/horses. I am trying to reread all the books to find all the missing characters and make a list to send to Joanna Campbell. I am hoping she will write a Super Special or something about what happened to them."
4,Getting better,"The books are getting better, adding more details about the horses and stuff like that. I really hope that some more drastic changes happen soon in the next few books. This book was definately better than the few before it. READ!"
3,Not Sure It Was Worth Bothering With,"It saves a little work, but not much. I would say, for the average Joe, this harness represents maybe 10 to 20 percent of the overall job, no more. Worth it? You decide."
1,Not Worth It,"There are only several taps made into the wires. If you don't mind making those taps, then don't order this. Also, it is really hard to stuff all of the wires back under the dash. Disconnect the existing plug (must undo 1 bolt) and then tap into the wires. It's a lot less bulky!"
3,Spoto's solid but flawed biography,"This is a far better book than Spoto's Art of Alfred Hitchcock, where he makes terrible mistakes. Spoto is an ambitious writer who obviously enjoys his subject's films. His vision of Alfred Hitchcock as a tormented and sexually frustrated artist is not entirely convincing. Spoto piles on the anecdotes but cannot create a staisfactory synthesis of tormented genius.Hitchcock eludes him as he has eluded most biographers. The central problem of Hitchcock was that he was an entertainer and no amount of intellectual analysis can deny this fact. His films were to be commercial successes and he aimed steadily at his market. Spoto focuses far too much on the sexual underpinnings of Hitchock's work and ignores the enormous fun of the films.This book is a fair introduction to Hitchcock. Writers like Robin Wood,have gone further and better. Yet in the end, the sheer volume of his research will make this obligatory reading on Hitchcock. It will never be defintive."
1,Todd A. Linn is right on!,I am sorry I ever read this book. It is totally depressing. If you believe Mr. Spoto Alfred Hitchcock never had a happy day in his life. Anyone who has viewed his movies know that this is nonsense.
2,A bit of a stretch,All of us have dark side and Hitch was no exception. But some of the conclusions of this author can be a bit of a stretch. At times he finds a turkey bone and reconstructs a dinosaur from it . You may find it hard to believe this dark sided person if you have seen the interview with his granddaughter who remembers the man who calls her up after her bunny dies to invite her over to spend time with her grandparents to get over the loss of the bunny.Or have heard Pat Hitchcock say the only trauma she had on the ride on the set of Strangers on a Train was she never got the money she was promised for getting on the ride. Take note the since Dad and Grandpa are now gone most would take the opportunity to set the record straight if he had been that dark and they haven't .What you get from the Hitchcock women is a loving memory that is hard to fake in this age of reality TV.
3,Not Sure It Was Worth Bothering With,"Bought this harness to reduce the work involved with installing an Alert Remote R350 Starter. The advertising says, essentially, it reduces the work required for installation by up to 80 percent, or something like that. Well, maybe for some. But, on my Ford F-250 pickem-up, I would say, maybe 10 percent. To be honest, I'm not sure it was worth the $16-$17 it cost me. But, this was my first install, and that may have had something to do with it. It may be a little different on other vehicles."
4,Love Conquers All,I liked Changeling Bride because of the paranormal genre but this was equally good because it was like a Cinderella fairy tale but with Valerian and Nathaniel both being of strong will Ms. Cach kept you in suspense till the end. Love how she intertwines a good storyline with the romantic involvement. Just ordered her next book and I am anxious to read more.
1,Bad,"These were so bad that they inspired me to write my first review on amazon! They look cute with their ""clawlike"" design, but they are completely non-functional. Because of the shape, you cannot get a grip on the cracker, and the cracker cannot get a grip on the claw. They slide around, fly out of your hands, and do everything but crack the claw. You might get by with a long, thin crab leg, but they do not work AT ALL for lobster claws, even the smaller joints. I wound up having to use a crab mallet to break open the lobster claw, which is no easy feat either. Do not buy these, get one with a better design."
1,ADVERTISED WRONG,"I love the doodleduster. We use the product in a commercial setting and it captures lots of dirt and dust. I bought it for home use. It is like a ""swiffer"" only much better. BUT BEWARE, if you buy this you only receive the cloths NOT THE HOLDER which you have to have to use it. It is a 3rd party purchase and that company refunded me the price and aplologized for how Amazon advertises. Remember, you ONLY GET THE CLOTHS in this purchase even though it says you get the holder in the order."
5,Best Mixed CD I've heard in a long time!!!,"I just bought The Best of NYC Afterhours - by BadBoyJoe & it is one of the best mixed CD's I've ever heard!!! This CD is great to listen to at the gym while your working out or while your driving. It isn't like those other boring CD's that are out there. The songs really keep you going. The track listing is great!! There are all of the hottest new club anthems, along with all of the old. I definitely recommend this CD to anyone that wants to listen to good music!!!"
1,Poor packaging ruined this item,The set was packaged in a cheap plastic book-like case by the manufacturer and not properly packed for shipping by Amazon.com. The plastic spokes that keep in the DVDs in place were broken for each and every disc. All of the discs were loose and some were damaged and do not work. I was very disappointed because the episodes are very good and I was looking forward to watching them.
2,"OK, but not much new","If you have done learning style inventories or Myers-Briggs style questionnaires, this will offer a little new material, but not enough to really make it worthwhile. There are some additional applications with regard to learning and studying, but they seem almost too obvious. They are on the order of: if you like things ordered and structured, then try to order and structure a more amorphous assignment, so it will be easier for you. Or: if this is something you feel would help you, then try it.It is a bit too wishy-washy for my taste."
3,"Not at all what I expected, even for the low price","You can see the hot glue bulges at the ends of the scabbard--very cheaply put together--where the decorative gold tips are attached. The stand is very unstable. As mentioned by previous reviewers there is a wax **and greasy** residue on the blade each time you pull it out. The decorative mouth cover came right off with the blade revealing hot glue was used to attach it to the Koiguchi mounth of the scabbard. From a distance it looks nice but up close not very impressive. I wouldn't pay the $32.95 (valued at $75 or more?). This was purchased based on price to donate for a charity auction, but wasn't even up to par for that. We'll see if they get $20 for it. If I hear better reviews from the bidders at the auction I will append this review... but I doubt it. (not sure if I used the sword anatomy names correctly, but you get the picture). :-("
4,Great stopping power,"I installed this on my '01 altima and followed proper bedding-in procedure. After driving it for over 5000 miles, I don't really feel any difference with respect to stopping power (cold and hot) ever since I installed it, so I guess it doesn't need to be bedded in (but I might be wrong!). Anyways, cold/wet stopping power is good but after accumulating a few degrees in temperature, I feel a point where the stopping power is less effective (or maybe a psychological effect only?). But wait till you reach the right temperature, stopping power is awesome! Pedal feel is also good."
3,Short But Sweet,"After a long wait jessicka and her ilk finally releashed a disk called Sweet heart dealer.The songs sound somewhat more matured then on Jack Off Jill's Clear hearts, Grey Flowers. However, the one that mixed the album did a poor job since s/he left jessicka's voice more on the background wich kinda anoys me. Maybe is suposed to to create a dreamy effect but all it does is weaken the songs.Also the album is FAR too short concidering its a debute album. As a brand new band and the long wait youd expect they had more songs.And although the album has pretty artwork (created by mark ryden) it has no lyrics or anything. Nope just a folded piece of paper with a band pic on the inside. Maybe they ran out of cash after the hired mark ryden for the art work...All in all its not a bad album and its worth checking but its nowhere near as good as the Scarling zealots that wrote reviews here claim it to be..."
1,Misses the boat,"Carter Heyward obviously never got through her transference, a term she dislikes. The book, although it professes to be for others, is really just a thinly-veiled self-serving,narcissistic diatribe against a therapist who, it seems clear from reading the book, established very proper boundaries which were in the patient's best interest. Evidently, Carter has never gotten over the anger she feels towards her therapist. To assume a therapist and patient can be friends outside the therapeutic boundaries denies the very nature of the therapist/patient dynamic. If Carter's therapist had become her friend, she could no longer serve as her therapist. Carter makes some very broad claims based on what seems to be very little training or knowledge of therapy. She overemphasizes the anti-patriarchal, mutuality tirades and her book becomes tiresome and redundant. Too bad her therapist doesn't have the opportunity to adequately defend herself."
2,Minority Dissenter,"I got this book used for well under the retail price. Now I feel guilty after reading all those glowing reviews. I don't deserve this book! What can I say? I don't like it. Mainly it's that I don't find the projects very inspiring. My use of embroidery tends toward embellishing clothing and linens. This book is for someone who wants to paint a picture with embroidery, or do a whole pillow or footstool. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I had in mind. I like a book more like Mary Thomas's, where you get inspired to use the designs for your own purposes."
1,Piece of crap.,"I bought this a while ago but as soon as I did it was crap, the stickers are oriented incorrectly. They feel off easily. When I received it it was unattached from the key chain. Is it cheep? Yes. Does that mean it's worth it? No."
5,The blades are superior,"What impressed me most about this blade, besides it being extremely easy to use, was the quality of the blades. They are super sharp and not like what you find at home depot. They seem to be teflon coated?Good construction, I am sure I will have it a lifetime (if I don't lose it!)."
1,how could they?,"How could they do this to Hector Berlioz? He was one of the greatest composers of his time. Les Troyens is arguable the greatest opera of it's time. Beatrice et Benedict is shear delight. Even Damnation of Faust is a masterpiece. Now they have crucified the earlier hobbled ""other"" opera Benvanuto Cellini. Yes this is a flawed work but still the work of a master. It is great music for a great orchestra as here superbly conducted by Valery Gergiev. It is worth doing but it must be done with gentle care. This production is a travesty. It is Euro-trash at it's worst (best?). There is fine music here but the singers were for the most part inadequate and totally unable to master French. Only the American singing R2D2 (Ascanio) came close to mastering the language. I wish I could get a disc of just the orchestra and her singing."
5,A wonderfully entertaining and heart-warming book.,Loving Penny was a joy to read. It brought back memories of those difficult times many of us faced while growing up. I think this is a must read for young teen and pre-teen girls. It will enlighten and hopefully cause all to focus on what's really important. Finding and loving oneself!
4,Good for me,"I'm not a pro baker but this one works fine for me, I find it easy to clean and the parts seem to be of decent quality. Good find for the price."
4,Wonderful Subtle Romance,"Crashcourse was a great cyberpunk novel, a bit disorienting with the menage a trois that persisted in the novel. Clipjoint (the second in the series) is, to me, a further exploration of the relationship between Swordfish (one of my all-time fave novel heros) and the protagonist, Cassandra, which started in Crashcourse. Although the writing didn't quite have the tight feel of Crashcourse, I enjoyed the story better because of the very understated subtle romance developing between these two characters. Highly recommend the read. The romance is reminiscent of Tannith Lee's Silver Metal Lover though of course being cyberpunk, is written in a very different tone."
4,This book was really good,"This was about Stephanie, Allie, and Darcy think that they are not spending enough time together so they make a deal called Friends First. It means they have to spend all of their free time together and no dating for a whole month. And Stephanie doesn't mean to but she breaks the promise, and she gets in a fight with her friends as usual. I don't understand why they are still her friend after all this time, but of course the ending is predictable."
3,"STOP!! You get only 3 episodes with 6 stories for ""Season 1""!","You can't tell from the title but you are not buying all of Season 1 of Chuggington -- you are only buying about 3 episodes with 6 stories. Customer Service tells me that is all they were allowed to license from Season 1. So, it's a little deceptive if you think you're getting the whole season. The low price is a tip off that it might not be all the season, of course, but I'm never sure about VOD pricing. So far, my 3 yr old hasn't tossed me overboard and taken over the ship for this but there is always tomorrow.Chuggington is a very cute and very adorable and educational cartoon. Highly recommend for kids and adults alike!"
1,What a P.O.S.!,"Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features. Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again. Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit! I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk! The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive. Save your money and save the headaches! Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster!"
3,NO USB cable,There is NO USB cable provided with this machine. And there is no notification of that fact before you buy. If one expects no cable it is not as frustrating as finding out that you cannot use the printer till you go to the store!!!
1,Inability to fax multiple pages,"If you like a machine pulling multiple pages through at one time and being forced to feed each page before it shuts off, then this is the machine for you."
1,Only half worked,Half of these work the other half didn't buy at you own risk I got cheap noname stuff that was great never buy this again.
5,WOW.,"I AM A NON-RELIGIOUS PERSON AND HAVE READ EACH OF THE BOOKS IN THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES.I RECOMMEND THIS SERIES OF BOOKS TO ANYONE RELIGIOUS OR NOT. THESE BOOKS ARE FACINATING AND KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE. IT ALSO TAUGHT ME ABOUT REVELATIONS IN THE BIBLE WITHOUT HAVING TO READ IT. I WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE BOOKS TO EVERYONE I KNOW AND WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK ""INDWELLING"". I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT THIS SPRING."
4,Books 1-6 are a great start to a series that eventually falls flat,"My rating may be misleading. I'm almost finished with the first book and I love it, even though I never would have guessed I'd be a fan of Christian literature and have limited familiarity with the New Testament and Revelations, but the ideas expressed in these books have really made me re-evaluate my life and I don't think any other book has had such a powerful impact on me. The Left Behind series takes the outline of Revelations and brings it to life to create a thrilling and interesting read. Although I have to admit, the writing can be a bit mediocre at times.Update May 3 2012: The first 7 or 8 books of the Left Behind series are great, however be warned that the series, in an attempt to squeeze a couple more books out of a planned 10-volume set, takes a turn for the worse after that and the plot starts to fall apart. Like many fans, I invested a lot of time in this series, only to be disappointed with the ultimate dénouement."
3,No pouch for accessories,The case comfortably holds a single paddle. There is a little extra padding for cases of this price range. Occasionally you can get a single case that holds two paddles; I would not put this case in that category. Unfortunately there is no front zipper pouch for accessories as described in the Amazon description. Most cases at this price range do include a separate space for balls. If you look at the picture provided by one reviewer you will see no pouch on the front. The picture shows the balls setting on the inside of the case.
4,"Nice looking, no complaints","I suppose like the other reviewer said, a hard case would be best to protect your paddle, but also more expensive. I like the look of this case, and its well made. I'm certainly no ""case-expert"", but I'm happy with this one."
5,Great Book-Fun Reading!!!!,"Taming The Beast Within is a book written by someone who grew up the same era as I did, questioned the world, and when the answers weren't acceptable, searched on. Weiss's outlook on life is witty, cynical, and very true.He makes you think about life and why as humans we do the things we do. His take on religion had me laughing because it is so truthful. (It would probably cause a riot in the Middle East).If you can see the humor in this book, I believe that you will enjoy reading it. I give two thumbs up to MH Weiss and Taming The Beast Within!!!"
3,OK,"I purchased two videos and this one gets the job done, but I find it a bit boring. With this DVD, you will get a good workout and you'll break a sweat. The fact that she is quite pregnant keeps you telling yourself that if she can do it you can, too. I wasn't bothered by the filming technique which some found to feel unprofessional, but I found myself wishing that there was another workout (other than the partner one) to choose from on the DVD."
5,A great read!,"The book starts with a sort of quirky quest -- to find out more about a ""great hedge""!! in India. The investigation leads into a deeper exploration of what the British presence in India was really all about. Anybody who is interested in India will want to read this book.For more reviews, look up the hardback edition of this book. At last count, there were 13 reviews there."
4,The best of the three,"Having now read all three in the trilogy, my personal opinion is this is the best of them. This book had a stronger romantic element, while still carrying the darker themes of the other two books. Simon Baldevar's character truly comes to life in this installment, and Meghann's pain and confusion translates to the reader. The story was sweet, sensual, and terrifying all at once."
2,hold your horses....,"Ok...lousy script, main chick nothing special,16 minutes of most important stuff are missing etc.Violence looks really stupid as main character has more money than god.Police, as usual, violate law."
1,dissatisfied,merchandise arrived in good condition. the title is somewhat misleading it is not marble it is sometype of wood with a look a like marble coating. the coffee table was damaged at one of the corners where the leg bolts on. 2 of the legs had 1 stripped bolt hole in each.
5,Review of Hamilton Khaki Auto 42mm watch,"Very happy with my purchase. The watch is exactly as I had envisioned and wanted. The product was shipped and delivered quickly. Packaging, instructions, warranty, etc. were all as expected."
4,MLB 07 The Show,"MLB '07 ""The Show"" comes across with a load of innovative and immersive features (RTTS, Franchise mode) but is plagued again and again by foolish little glitches and bugs that almost ruin the whole experience. If you are someone who can easily get past these bugs, MLB `07 will prove to be a great game, with the ""Road to the Show"" game mode being the feature that is particularly alluring. If you don't need the RTTS feature, or will find routinely inept AI and occasional game-breaking bugs too big an issue, I would advise to shop around or wait for a bargain. Overall, the game feels and plays rushed- but I'm still playing."
5,one of my favorite games,Still have my PS2 and I still play this game. Great graphics and I love keeping up with stats. One of my all time favs.
2,ALOT of paddle,"It had the same spin as my 25 yr old paddle but I couldn't keep the ball on the table. I kept hitting it long due to the hardness of the wood (carbon), and couldn't make the adjustment. I sent it back for a full refund."
2,"Good, but split","I had used this ball for one practice session, and after I was done, it had a large split across the seam. Would not buy again."
4,Great customer service,"Jason at datasales.com demonstrated the best customer service available. We ordered this laptop, and had it for about a week before we realized there is no sound. So I called him, and without blinking an eye, he offered to send another laptop -- that he wanted to make sure there wasn't a problem, and that the best solution would be to send us another machine. He did this within two days, and now is paying for the shipment of the first machine back to him. A good guy. Totally recommend. the laptop is nice. chunky keys. love it. Not a lot of memory (which doesn't matter because we store things on an external drive), but fast enough for us. And for less than $150!"
2,it doesn't work,the computer would not turn on even with a new battery and everything else. i was not happy with it!
4,"More, Please!","Yes, please! Hungarian Rhapsody - Queen Live in Budapest may be the same songs you're used to from Queen's Live at Wembley and Live Magic albums, but it's still fantastic!I'm a little disappointed in the actual Blu-Ray of the concert because it's actuallly missing songs that are on the CD's. Four songs to be exact - Another One Bites the Dust, Looks Like It's Gonna Be A Good Night - Improv, You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care), and Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart). While the last three are reasonable losses, how on Earth can you cut Another One Bites the Dust?!?Still, if you bought this mainly for the CD's like I did, then you're going to get your monies worth just from them, and the Blu-Ray is just an added bonus.I really wish that Queen would release more live albums from the past. There have got to be a ton of them shelved somewhere."
3,Cute for awhile,"Okay, I really wanted this toy for myself, not the kids. I thought it would somehow be like a pet without the responsibility, or maybe it was just so darned cute I couldn't help myself. It has been almost 9 months and here is what I know. 1) It is really cute 2) If you can program it, power to you, but I never could manage to make my own skit 3) It really does respond to touch 4) it is fascintated with my black and white cat for some reason 5) It gets around pretty well 5) the kids seem to really enjoy it 6) for a 4 hour charge you get about 1 hour of play 7) there really isn't much you can do with it. Of course I bought it back when it was alot more expensive, but even at a lower price, if I had to do it all over again, I think I would just skip it. It really is an amazing robotic toy, and perhaps if I could figure out how to make my own skit, I would have enjoyed it more."
1,MY BAD!!!,"This CD has nothing but night sounds on it...crickets chirping, etc....I listened to it for about 20 minutes, thinking that surely the music would start eventually, but......it never did, NO music, only crickets or some such. If crickets is what you want, go ahead, buy it; if you are after some (any) type of music...pass!!!!!"
5,Relaxing,"I had read great things about Maya Fiennes' yoga products, and they are true. She has a calm manner, and easy for a mid-level yogi like me."
5,Worth to buy!,"I wasn't sure if I want to buy this DVD or go to the Netflix and rent it first, but after reading the reviews I've decided to give it a try. Maya is amazing - she selected the best music and I actually learned a few new moves from her. I would highly recommend to anyone who is interested in spiritual yoga, the guys who are fans of Power yoga might not like it since it's not about burning calories..."
2,"no flowing practice, to me it makes very little sense","A yoga practicioner for many years, I had not yet tried kundalini yoga and admittedly did not know what to expect. I am sorry to say I was very dissappointed. There is no flow in this yoga, very few of the well known poses (no downward dog for example) and no logical sequence. The teacher is very very chatty, sometimes she reminds one to breathe but the movements are so quick that I didn't yet figure out how to use the uyai breath here, though maybe one doesn't?. The music is not my taste either. If you are used to having your own practice this may not be your best choice. I gave it one star not two, because I did feel a little energised afterwards. My body is as still as before I started though!! I did think that it may be nice for people who cannot use their lower limbs well as there is a lot of arm action which in itself is interesting."
3,Maybe Kundalini is not for me,"I've tried a couple of kundalini DVD's. Typically I enjoy the physical aspects of the workout: it is different from traditional yoga in a good, complementary way. But equally typically, I seem to dislike the music to which the workout takes place and the tone / attitude of the commentary. This is somewhat less true for this DVD than for the Ana Brett one, but still true!"
1,"Well, Let Me Tell You","This author must not have much value of herself by writing this book. She berates the family that she was born into, but excuses all the things she did in life. If she thought her home life was so bad, then why didn't she do something to better herself than sleep around, and then feel the need to tell the entire world about it. Maggie sounds like a very insecure person who wants people to feel sorry for her. Too bad she can't find the courage to make the world a better place to live in, instead of berating her family."
1,Well Let Me Tell You,"As a family member of Mable Miller's, I have to say I am outraged at the lies and exagerations in this book. I read the book impartially, but found it quite difficult to read because of (1) all the grammatical errors and (2) because all the male characters at one time or another are called ""John"". I have to wonder if subconsciously Mable feels like a prostitute...all their sexual partners are referred to as ""Johns"". All this book reflects is Mable's anger and hatred toward her family."
4,Decent Book,"Good book with lots of good black and white photos. Informative captions. Only drawback is there are no color photos except for the cover images. There are examples of some of the cars still in existence as I have seen them at vintage racing events. Though the book is a collection of photos from a collection, some color pictures of surviving cars would make the book more complete."
4,A winner and a bargain,"I would have expected to pay much more for a such a high quality and informative atlas. The maps are very detailed and easy to read. There is also a large section of accompanying text relating to landforms, weather, vegetation, the economy, history and demographics etc. including many graphs and ilustrative photos, as well as a comprehensive index of places."
2,Lots of tidbits,"I got this hoping it would have the big picture of the layout of the city and the must see information as well as the off the beaten track info. The video is lots of 3 minute snapshots of cool ""unusual"" things to do in Barcelona. As the other reviewer points out, the lack of ""play all"" is a drag. You have to navigate through the menus way too much.If you already know about Barcelona and want insights about where to go outside of the typical tourist areas then grab this video. If you want an overview of the city and its highlights look elsewhere."
4,Not for small wrists,"The monitor is fine for a basic user like me and definitely a good deal, but I'd like to know how they define small wrists :). The watch is too big. The actual monitor on the chest strap might seem a bit bulky, too, but it's not inconvenient unless you plan on exercising on your belly. In which case, of course, you don't need a heart rate monitor :)."
1,Broke first day I used it!,I was reading the user manual and when I went to set the time the reset button fell off. There's no way I can put it back in where it will stay so I will have to send it back for a replacement. I ordered it directly from Heart Rate Monitors USA so hopefully they will treat me right.
4,Much better than expected: excellent value for the money,"I got this heart monitor a week ago and I am really pleased with my purchase.It's simple, but it does all I need sufficienty accurately: monitor my heart rate as I exercise. You can use it for some slightly more advanced tasks, but you have to read the manual, which is a bit involved.I am petite, and this model fits me perfectly. But it can be adjusted to fit my husband too (he uses it regularly now!).The best (and unexpected) feature is that the chest strap is compatible with my Precor heliptical machine.More bonuses: a spare wrist band, and battery which can be replaced at home, without having to send the monitor back to the company.Bottom line: why spend more than twice for a Polar when you can get the same functionality out of this one?"
4,"Fantastic Interpretation Of Janacek's Quartets, But...","Fans of the Guarneri String Quartet will be pleased with this exquisite recording of Janacek's string quartets. These were recorded in the same Washington Heights, Manhattan studio used by the Emerson String Quartet for their critically acclaimed Beethoven string quartet cycle. A splendid choice since the acoustics are vividly warm. As for these performances, the Guarneri Quartet's performance is quite lyrical, emphasizing the melodic qualities of Janacek's music. I hadn't heard these string quartets before; undoubtedly they must rank as one of the finest works in the string quartet canon. Although these are exceptional performances recorded via Philips' latest digital state of the art technology, they come at a rather steep price. That's why I am giving this CD four stars instead of five, since it is a rather expensive acquisition for forty one minutes of recorded performances. Still, it is worth acquiring."
2,Dreadful...,"I was excited when I ordered this item, as Urahara is one of my favourite characters. I saw some bad reviews on this item, saw a few good ones, noticed it was pretty cheap, and I got it in hopes that it favoured the good side of things. Not this time. This hat is garbage. The head piece is too short, and the brim is too wide and floppy. Good material and colour, minus the off white colour instead of the white. When I put it on, instead of looking like a bucket hat, it looked more like a child's cowboy hat."
3,Colors,"When I opened the package I was disappointed, the colors are not accurate don't be fooled by the picture. The green is OK but what is supposed to be white is cream/off white. the fabric is fine its kind of canvas like and the stripes are sort of like the fabric ribbon type of stuff, not what i would have used but ok. Its a little too floppy but the colors were the biggest issue."
3,This night splint is OK,"It is comfortable on the skin, but it doesn't actually hold my heel down in the corner of the brace. The velcro is very strong, but it seems to lack something. It just doesnt' really hold my foot in the correct position. It may be that the brace is too large."
2,try a different brand,"i had the swede-o splint for two nights and my foot felt alot better from plantar fasciitis. the downsides are that u have to order a size smaller, which i didand it was still too big on my foot. the biggest gripe i have is that the velcro staps used to hold it to my foot started to remove the stiching on the straps themselves. After two nights i knew if i kept using it that the stiches would come apart and it would become useless, i returned it and got a full refund."
3,Comfortable,"I have plantar fasciitis and have only been wearing the splint for a week so I'm not sure if it's helping. It's pretty comfortable but my foot gets very warm in it, probably because of the felt material. May be unbearable in the summer."
4,The Magic Boot,"I tried a couple of other splints that some reviewers raved about, but they were not as good for me as this one. Every body is different, so you may have to try a few brands to find the one that works for your feet.This is the one for me. After about 4 weeks with the splint, doing the stretches, the icing, and the massage, my foot has no heel or arch pain. From the first night I had no problem sleeping with it on. In fact, it felt so soft and supportive that I looked forward to wearing it. I did order down one size based on other reviews, and that was good advice.I only gave this four stars because I found it annoying to have the straps constantly adhering to the boot surface every time they made contact. I solved that problem by getting some velcro at the store and cutting out three pieces to attach to the velcro on the straps when not in use.For me it was worth the search to find the magic splint. This is it."
3,Missing b-sides,"On the B-side of the 45 ""Rock The Boat"" a great song that is way before it's time""Were all Going Down Together"". i don't see this anywhere in these collections."
4,A good choice for fans,"""Rock the Boat"" went to number one, but people forget the sound-alike follow-up ""Rockin' Soul"" came close to making the top ten and that ""Freedom For the Stallion"" was a pretty soulful chart 45 as well. This collection of singles and LP tracks is the best representation of the group you'll find. Omitted is a 1977 chart single ""I Caught Your Act""."
2,You get what you pay for..,"I bought this headset for my sons for christmas who are 3yrs & 5yrs. These headsets were adjustable, but at the largest size were still totight on their little heads. These headsets must have been sized foran infants head instead of a kids head. Even my 3yr old couldn't wearthem. The two stars is only for the ability for the boys to talk to eachother, but they have to move the earphones up to their ears to hear sincethey can not wear them on their heads. You get what you pay for, so ifyou have kids with extremely little heads this is the headset for you.Otherwise get a better set and spend the extra $."
2,A good plot concept that never carries through,"This book was a serious disappointment. The delightful romance promised by the back cover cannot carry the rest of the dragging plot through. The biggest disappointment was the characters: the hero is thoroughly unlikeable and almost out of the regency mindset (what kind of ""gentleman"" would attempt to seduce a virginal lady?). The attempted interaction of the town people falls flat on its face, too. The few flashes of wittiness cannot make up for the wholly uninspiring content of the story.By the middle of the book, I just wanted it to be done. But I was on vacation with nothing else to read, so I finished it off. The ending makes up, perhaps, the rest of the book. But, in a regency, the ending is always good, so this is nothing unusual."
1,Syracuse Jersey,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Do not buy anything from Football Fanatics for that matter. I've ordered two different jerseys and both times they have sent me a jersey that is not the same one from the picture. Again, DO NOT BUY THIS if you don't want them to send you the wrong jersey!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not too great,"The movie is okay for kids, but the quality is horrible. If you dislike grainy poorly written movies then avoid this one."
3,Found it to lack real depth,"The songs are nice and the music pleasant to listen to, but the titles are fairly short and there is something missing. I just didn't find it to be very moving, perhaps it's just the recording."
4,Good despite the silly cover.,The traditional selections on this CD are quite good and give a decent range of styles and performers. I am pleased with the purchase and enjoy repeat listening.
5,This book was a lifesaver. Scored a 5,"I just wanted to let the Princeton Review people know that I'm very grateful for their AP books, particularly the AP Biology Princeton Review book. (I was recommended by a friend to purchase it.) In a class where biology seemed so foreign and impossible to comprehend, the ""Cracking the AP: Biology"" PR book was a lifesaver. The book was informative, easy-to-understand, and thorough, without being dull or lengthy. In fact it was your book that helped me to achieve a 5 on the AP exam, a feat that I never could have pulled off alone. Thanks Princeton Review! I always enjoyed and found confidence in your blunt, honest approach to the AP exams. I am fully convinced that your program's strategies work, and I plan to enroll in your SAT II Writing class in the fall. Thanks again and continue helping out stressed out students like me!"
4,Dreamweaver fast & easy,"This book is one of the easiest books to understand on a technical level. Anyone with a beginer to intermediate level technical background of webdevelopment would greatly apperciate this book. It shows you the steps with corresponding pictures of how to use Dreamweaver 3. Very, very good book that will teach you Dreamweaver in a day or two. I read this entire book in one day and started my business that same week. One week later I'm making $500 a day. Thanks"
2,Not much of a party,"Boy, wouldn't you love to groove to that great twang the 'Diary laid down in the 80's? Your tuntable was sold at that garage sale your ex ""arranged"" and now your vinyl copies of ""Mars Needs Guitars"" and ""Jamboree"" lay forever silent. While there is a rather pedestrian take of ""Watusi Redeo"", you'll not find any of the band's true rockers such as ""Pray for Rain"", ""Fear of God"" or ""Jamboree"". Not even a peep of sugar pop like ""Always Saturday"". Best to pass on this one. Your best bet is to wait for the band's catalogue to be sold and a true re-packaging done by one of the consolidators. --or- call your ex and find out who bought your turntable. ""Flip Flop"" was the only Guadalcanal Diary title to make it onto CD and even it is now out of print. Sometimes there's just no justice. This title certianly doesn't do justice to the 'Diary."
2,POR,"I have purchased and read this book. In my opinion the very title was relished!: Why must there always be a reason for something? and on/in what grounds does the principle of reason lie? Indeed for anything whatsoever? ""Why the why?"" Cool subject for me! My 4 year old copy is dog-eared and scribbled on. Those who have purchased this book surely will agree when I say that there are a great many gleanings to be had from this digestible and erudite work. A very satisifying book."
5,The Wonder of the Water,"""Waves"" caught my eye while I was searching for something unrelated, can't remember what, but when I saw it, I was drawn in, abandoned previous search, and had to have it. I grew up by the water, spent every waking moment in the waves on my little beach back home, and this book instantly made me feel the powerful pull of the ocean from the front cover to the back. Every page is breathtakingly beautiful, it makes me long to paint, to capture the strength and delicacy of water the way these photographs do. Alas, that is not to be, but at least I can look at these amazing pictures and dream. There is text about the dynamics and working of waves, very good, but the pictures blow me away."
4,Excellent,"Worth congratulating Philips that here (as in several more recent releases) ""Russian Text"" really means that, in cyrillic not transliteration. Timing 56'40."
1,It needs an editor!,"I like sci-fi, and I love time travel stories, but ...With all the flaws tmm2112 noted, I can't believe he still gave 4 stars! I won't reiterate - check tmm's review! I will add that the digressions tmm cited were provided at the expense of key scenes of the story! He expounded on the theory of time travel, then skipped the whole experience!Worst of all for me was the hideous overuse of the exclamation point! It was painful at first - now I'm afraid I am inured and that it will take several (edited) books before I will again notice the difference between a statement and an exclamatory!And was that an ending, or was the author interrupted before completing this tale?!"
3,OK Item,"The game itself is nice and easy to follow on the TV. But the boards that you write on are no good at all, the markers have bearly any ink in them and it's so hard to clean the boards once you write on them."
3,"Great Ship Time, In Perfect Condition","My wife wanted this for Christmas- it got here a few days after, however, we played it once since and it was just alright- interesting concept, but there is so much more they could do to update the game itself- Imagine playing against a whole bunch of people from the 70s - it will probably be more fun at our next 'party' when we can play with real people."
5,"Fun, quick and historical!","A very good read! It's not only fun and entertaining, but throw inn historical revelance to boot! A good book for everyone."
3,Blue Cheer Burnt Out,"I stumbled upon Blue Cheer looking up Jimi Hendrix. I downloaded a few songs and was so impressed by what i heard, i bought Vincebus and Outsideinside. It was hard to find much in stores though, but i found this album in a record store and bought it without knowing anything about it. I was dumbfounded when i put it on and didn't recognize the voice on all but the last two songs. I guess Dickie Peterson's voice couldn't take him singing the way he did for all those years. The idea of a mellow Blue Cheer album sounds like a great idea... but what i was listening to wasn't Blue Cheer. The shock and frustration calmed, however, when i flipped to side B and actually started to like what i heard. ""OH! Pleasant Hope"" and ""Ecological Blues"" and the two Dickie actually sings on are great (so is ""I'm the Light"" but i get tired of it sometimes). As for side A... maybe one of these days, but for now it's all about side B."
4,Something NEW on the ambient scene,"Fully satisfying ambient tunes, with a hard nosed back beat. Only thing to watch out for is the female vocal...if you do not dig a Bjorkish sounding lead then you might find it annoying. Could have done just as well without any vocal at all. All in all a surprisingly good buy. have seen it for upwards of $17.00 in stores.s_dennis@hotmail.com"
5,Learning Andy James songs while honing your technique,"Previously I bought a couple of Andy Jame's Extreme Guitar Metal edge series found that with practice I learn a lot about scales, rhythm and technique. So I took a chance and decided to check out Soloing Vol. 1 out. It didn't disappoint. Like the other DVDs Andy James demonstrates and then breaks down the rhythm/solo sections step-by-step. Also, the Metal Edge series usually has Andy's original material and his material is awesome. Andy James does an excellent job on explaining where, what and how to play the songs. Also, he will explain the best approach technique-wise. The songs are fun to learn and great to polish on the techniques in the realms of heavier type of metal within the intermediate and advance area.pjt"
4,"Well, great performance footage...","This DVD analyzes the techniques used in a melodic shred context; namely on two tracks off Andy's latest album ""In The Wake of Chaos"" called 'Devil's Day' and 'Shine on Through', and a previously unreleased single called 'Underworld'.Andy performs all three songs in their entirety, but the (extremely thorough) breakdown is only of the main solo of each song as well as the rhythm accompaniment of that section. However, the performance footage is of superb quality and up close, and if you already have the skill to play any of these tunes, you can easily figure out 90% of the tracks just by watching the performances.Needless to say, the tracks are really amazing and Andy is truly a melodic shredder that all John Petrucci fans will relate to."
4,good,"good but not amazing like I thought they would be. I expected the material to be softer, but they are very durable and get the job done."
1,Didn't touch her at all.,"This completely didn't work for my 4lb toy poodle. I even used two full syringes and NOTHING. She was still just as stressed during her walk in the city. She is a rescue with high anxiety levels even after 2 years of nothing but pure love. I'm trying to go the more natural way to help her anxiety, unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working."
1,101 Fudge Factors For Those Ignorant of Risk Neutral Pricing,"This book should be titled ""I do not know how to price all risks when valuing companies so here are 101 fudge factor guesses I use instead"". This is the wrong way to value companies and is inconsistent with financial asset pricing theory. Look elsewhere for better resources."
4,Good Album,"this is Luni COleones first album under the name Luni Coleone and its the best one under that name. most of the tracks have good beats and tight flows with a lot of good featured talent on a lot of the tracks. there were a few tracks i didnt like, but if you are a fan of luni coleone and sacramento rap this is a good pick."
5,Just Love 'em,"These chocolate sprinkles are lovely, rich, dark chocolate.Our main use for these is on the top of lattes - sprinkle a half teaspoon or more on top of the foam and wait a minute for them to melt a little or stir them in. Delicious. We used to use a high quality sweetened dark cocoa powder but everyone likes these better.Please note that this jar is HUGE. We divide it up into smaller plastic containers they stay as fresh as possible."
3,"Complete, but not very practical","It is nice to have all these Mozart piano pieces on one CD, however they are all just bare bone versions with four significant problems:1.Lack of any editorial information.2.Lack of fingering and most articulation marks.3.Cumbersome process of printing and putting all these pages together.4.In formatting options provided, notes come out a little to small and difficult to read for somebody over 40. You may actually need so called ""computer glasses"" for reading at the medium distance.If you are young, don't mind taping pages together, and have a good teacher to provide you with fingering and articulation, this may be something for you"
4,Great starter puzzle.,"I purchased this puzzle to go with the stuffed dinosaur i purchased for my nephew for his birthday. This is the perfect beginner puzzle. The pieces are simple enough for a young child starting puzzles and the bright colors are great to keep his/her interest. It made like all the previous Melissa and Doug puzzles i have purchased for my own children, very sturdy. It will last and i can't wait to give it to him."
4,fun toy,I loved this toy for my child because it was not a choking hazard and it was really bright and colorful. my child enjoys playing with it and learning colors and about dinosaurs.
4,No pieces to lose!,"We bought this for our three-year-old daughter when we took a multi-day road trip. She loves puzzles, but I knew that we wouldn't want to deal with dropping, finding, and/or losing little pieces in the car. Since these pieces stay on the track, this was perfect!Surprisingly, our one-year-old son loved it too! I thought it would be a little advanced for him, but they both play with it regularly."
5,FANTASTIC! Received order before shipping estimate!,Thank you for getting parts to me ASAP! I have a commercial building with 4 HVAC systems.(redundant heat and A/C) !I was able to operate on three systems but felt much better getting 4th back online. I will definitely order more back up parts from you for the shelf. Many thanks!
4,Great phone!,"This phone is almost the same size as my v525 (last phone) but yet you get a full keyboard! I love that. Also, most frequently used functions can be accessed without opening the phone up including looking in you phonebook, making a call, silencing the ringer, etc. I do not have the problem someone else mentioned that the calls disconnect every 10 minutes or so - even if t-mo customer service said that was a bug in the phone I have never had it happen. The keyboard is good for the text messaging I do. No more T9! Yes!The camera isn't the best but it is the same as the v600 phone and similar Moto models. Bluetooth works fabulously. Battery life - I don't talk on the phone a tremendous amount and I only have to charge it every other day. I love the alarm clock and that I can snooze it without opening the phone up. I think this is a great value and you'll be pleased with it!"
1,You can't hear the caller!,"It's a really good looking phone in a good size.Major con:- You won't be able to hear the caller unless you use the speaker or hands-free!- There is a major error in the user manual that took me hours to find ""Settings"" of the phone.- The only availible holster is in leather - not very attractive."
2,Rather boring,"James Silk Buckingham's Travels among the Arab Tribes Inhabiting the Countries East of Syria and Palestine: Including a Journey from Nazareth to the Mountains beyond the Dead is a tedious, travelogue written by a man who attempts to place far greater importance upon his journeys than they warrent. Often he makes claims of discovery to minor ruins that are without any historical merit or importance. Buckingham's wordy style soon becomes boring. Indeed, his book is both dull and insipid. As for his pandering to Lady Hester Stanhope the less said the better. Buckingham lacks the wit of Kinglake and there is little in this massive tome (700 plus pages), that was not already covered with far great aptitude by John Lewis Burckhardt."
5,Easy to Navigate This Rich Resource,"WOW! This compendium of more than 100 of John Carver's articles would be useful enough if it only collected these important articles on Policy Governance into one volume. This publication goes several steps further - by starting with a Frequently Asked Questions Guide, the reader is directed to his or her most urgent concerns. These FAQs appear throughout the book along with pull-out quotes that focus the reader's attention on key issues in the section. Both these features make the book easy to navigate and consequently, a richer resource.It's great to have these articles combined into one resource since many have been previously published in hard to access journals. This will be a great resource for those new to Policy Governance as well as to experienced practitioners."
3,Another Disney chapter,If you know the movie Mulan then you will love this add on pack. It was a little disappointing but at the same it worked. I just wished there was more Disney variety.
4,Paperback is nice,"I bought the paperback, surprised by the low price, and was pleased that it's large (8 1/2 x 11) and full of color pictures of both the food and the B&B rooms: it must be just like the hardback except for the cover. A great value, even if nutrition data (calories, fat, etc.) are not included and it's slightly dated (1991). Can't wait to try the recipes - they look great."
5,LOVE IT,"My Husband loves this, plays it all the time in the MAN Cave. Very good buy for him. Glad I bought it"
1,Junk!!!!,These discs won't record in my audio recorder or my computer burner and are worthless. I tried ordering what I thought was the original CD-R Music discs that were only for audio CD recorders and not for computers and they substituted these worthless things. I am in a bind to find anything for my audio CD recorder. If anyone knows one that will still work let me know. The place that substituted was not Amazon by the way.
5,The Fountainhead from a young girls point of view,"From being secretly admired yet shunned for his bizarre modernistic architectural style, from being loved and loathed alike by the only woman he will ever have, this story of Howard Roark is both compelling and heartbreaking. Set in the roaring 20's, though not any of the focus of the book, Howard Roark sets off to do what he loves, having no one stand in his way and having no one tell him how to do what he is meant to do. To have the only woman he is ever to love marry the man he hates the most, and to make it at what he does the best. Architecture."
3,Latin Lover,"Just received this CD, and quite frankly, am a little dissappointed...Having heard some of these artists for the first time, and being a huge collector of Latin CD's, this CD did not really deliver...very amateurish, and not the best sounding as well...There are 50 songs, so the value is really there, however, I have to skip many tracks until I get to the ones I really like....I would think twice before I purchased this CD."
3,Hole in it,"Within the first week of use one of the little squared leaked. Overall, we like the product, but disappointed in the quality."
2,I don't like,Great idea if it had lasted more then a week hot/cold mat leaked in the first week making product un useable.
3,The Height of Fashion,"Finally, a reissue of the long out-of-print CD on Arista. 80's freaks are going to swoon over this, basically being the album ""Fabrique"" of 1982 plus selected 12"" mixes and b-sides from the same period. If you have the original LP you'd want this. I wish they had remastered it though, which is why I only gave 3 stars.."
4,Fun Graphic Novel Suitable for Younger Readers,"Like the title says, this is a fun graphic novel. Written at a fairly easy level it would be appropriate for younger readers as there's not 'adult content'. I read it myself and enjoyed it; then passed it along to my 9 year-old son who's in the process of reading Volume II.The story is about the Golden Fleece of antiquity, of course. In Indie's world, it actually exists but has been lost over time because it was desecrated and lost it special appearance. No longer looking like the magical object that it is, everyone seeks it because it makes the possessor victorious in battle. Certainly something that might be useful during WWII.Indie gets involved in the usual way and runs counter to not only Nazis, but 'the cult of Hecate'. She's the goddess to whom the fleece originally belonged. His companion is not a love interest in this one, but is instead she is a very pregnant character named Omphale.Good 'library find'.Pam T~mom/#kidlit blogger"
3,Arthritis impaired? Don't bother with this product,"This product appeared to be well manufactured of quality materials. It was a little larger and heavier to maneuver than expected. I had been using uprights for years and was looking forward to the flexibility and lightness of push/pulling only a powerhead. However, the machine proved to be still too heavy for my weakness, and I was disappointed in it's suction power. Also, assembling and disassembling the chrome wands was difficult and painful for me. Someone with normal strength and bare floors might be a satisfied customer."
4,I like this vacuum a lot!,"Quieter than some (though not ""quiet""), and it does a good job on my bare floors. I don't have carpet, so I don't know about that. The cord is too short, as others have noted. I LOVE not having vacuum bags! Now, I live out in the country, and I just take this and my Roomba's dust bins outside to dump out the dust and dog hair--if I had to mess with dumping it into a trash bag, I might not be so entranced. I guess it depends on how much you hate having to remember to buy and change vacuum bags!"
1,Don't buy a Sanyo DirtHunter SCX2100P w/Power Nozzle,I was very impressed when I received my new Sanyo Dirthunter it seemed to fullfill all my expectations until I used it for the 10th time that was when the powerhead stopped working the ligth still tcomes on but the motor did not make a sound.The Vacuuum is still like brand new not a scratch on it I have a small 2 bedroom condo I live alone so vacuums do not have to work hard in my home. Part of my floor is tiled so I have maybe a total of 600 sqare feet that gets vacuumed and this unit could not do this 10 times.I would not not buy this or any other Sanyo Product again because now I have a vacuum that looks brandnew and is unusable there is not other type of cleaning head that comes with this unit the powerhead is all there is with it gone the cleaner is completely useless. I contacted the Manufacturer and I have yet to hear from them it has been over 2 weeks needless to say in the meantime I had to buy a new vacuum not a Sanyo I like to add
2,Just unreliable and poor Sanyo service,"I bought this vaccum cleaner about 18 months ago. I was satisfied with it until 3 weeks ago when the vaccum just stopped working without any warning. The machine must have completed a total of 6 hours operation since I used it mainly to clean our guest room which has a carpet. I checked the filters, they still looked like new. I called Sanyo who referred me to the closest repair shop in... Tennessee ( I live in New Orleans, LA). As I expressed my discontent, I was told by the Sanyo assistant that it was up to me to buy a Sanyo product. I guess that will be my last one!."
1,crap service,This is supposed to be a multi colored light with built in light diffusers. I recieved nothing but a white spot light that spins. Item sucks
4,Hey!!!! its good!!!,"Adam Sandler's new cd.....is goodits not great.....but its goodit certainly does not surpass the likes of ""they're all gonna laugh at you,"" or what the hell happened to me, but what would? those albums are classics, and honestly what can you expect?. However this album is better than ""whats you name,"" and ""stan and judy's kid."" Honestly, this is the next step in Adam Sandler classics!Its a good mix of skits and songs. I, honestly prefer skits over songs, but even the songs are great!!! so.......If you like the old adam sandler.....then you will like this one...its not perfect...but worth the purchase! It may not be his best....but its still good!!!!!"
1,Inexcusible,"This is garbage, any way you sniff it. I was a big fan of his earlier CDs but if you're looking for laughs here there are only about three of them. This CD reminds me of Adam Sandler's movie career in regards to how his movies are getting continually worse. This, however, ups the ante; there are no redeeming qualities about this CD at all. I can't be emphatic enough to potential buyers: don't. It's very, very bad. It's the culmination of his tired humour, which seems to get worse as the years go by, combined with clearly very little effort put in here. I'd be surprised if he spent more than a lazy week completing it from start to end."
5,Splendid sonics to accompany this great music,"While I confess to being poorly versed in the music of Shostakovich, I must say that, as an audiophile, this is one of the best sounding CDs I've ever heard. The dynamics are among the widest of any disk in my collection, and the tonal structure and balance is rivaled only by few others. There's no hint of denoising here either: if your system is capable of retrieving low level information, you'll find a trace of sub sonic rumble coming through your speakers. This, I think, is ample testimony for the great job that Bernie Grundman has given to all of his work for the Classic Records label."
4,Genuine and well written,"""Is Your Family Like Mine"" is a very good family book for 4-7 year olds. Even though the main character is a girl, my six year old son wants to read it every night before going to bed. He enjoys seeing other families like his own (two moms). I appreciate authors, like Lois Abramchik, who are able to present realistic family life without forcing ideas upon the reader and avoid giving so much detail that the story line does not flow.The story is simple and repetitive, time and time again stating that Love is what makes a family. Whether you have a mom and dad, two moms, just a dad and siblings... love is what makes all families the same. I highly recommend this book for children who are beginning school. School is when children really begin to notice family differences. This book may help reinforce in their minds how much they are loved and that they are no different from any other family."
1,A failed attempt to improve on an old standard,"I bought this cord because I was tired of the way the plastic lip always breaks on the Canon version and this one has a metal plate on the mount instead of plastic, so I thought that might solve the problem. The metal plate is a good idea, but the way the head is mounted on the plate with a screw, it got loose the first weekend I used it and there was no way to tighten it, so the flash and mount wobbled and spun around on the screw. Not helpful."
5,Great Music as usual,"This is great recording,I enjoy listening to itveru much. This is acompilation of all thefavorite waltzes bythe Strauss family, thatone might hear at aNew Year's eve concertof the Vienna Philharmonic...All waltzes and Polkas arefavorites of audiences everywherein the world..."
4,Cool Looking Shell,Product is solid and does a great job with protection. all plugs and buttons are accessible easily. Only thing is the casing is rather thick and no longer fits into any docks without removing the shell first.
1,Not for Me,"This book is far from academic. The fact that black women have struggled with the issue of african-textured hair vs. societal attitudes isn't new and this book doesn't shed any new light on the subject. I agree that Dr. Cornwell is a business woman but I don't see the lack of color photos, styling tips or a list of Sisterlock technicians as doing anything to improve her marketing."
3,Hear but don't look,"When it comes to music, it's hard to top Arena. Their musical talent and creative diversity make for music that just never wears ""old"" on the ears. The music here is no exception. Often live recordings lose something both in the music itself and with sound quality. That's not the case with this recording. So why only three stars? Well, the video portion of this release is a big disappointment. With the creative talent of Arena, you'd expect much more than third grade mentality antics and commentary. If you expect to see the band actually performing, this Video doesn't cover that either other than blurps of Rob Sowden performing his magic. I don't think I even saw the rest of the band performing at all and haven't yet built up the ambition to go back and see if perhaps I just blinked at the wrong time. For music, this release is darn near 5 star but the video is a stretch for 1 star, thus the overall 3 rating."
5,Great Novel for anyone who loves The American Revolution!!!,This is a great book. The author uses widely accurate information to give a detailed account of the battle and the events that led up to it. He also uses an action packed story line to help tell the story. This book would be a perfect read for anyone who enjoys American history.
4,Entertaining and Historically Accurate,"I am a fan of all historic novels, but most stray from the actual accounts. This book does not. It is neat to actually learn something while reading a novel for entertainment. It is not necessarily a page-burner, but it kept the action rolling pretty well."
5,good drive,this product has become an everyday part of my computer use. It works great and was easy to install. I had to download an add-in from windows but other than that it was plug and play.
4,A good help for additional understanding,"These cliffs notes helped me very much studying this book for my high school english class. The parts that i didn't undertand reading the novel, the cliffs notes cleared up for me. If you're reading this book for school or for enjoyment, I would get the CliffsNotes for it just to supplement the reading."
4,"Great for young folks, good for adults","The books are very well done, pictures and timelines inclusive but are targetting younger readers. As an adult I must admit MOST of the content were things I did not know but thats more of a review of our schools than this book.For your 10-12 year old age group they are the best. For adults they are interesting and beautifully pictured but brief. Im glad I bought them but I wish my expectations had been set as to how short they are."
5,The Famous Historical Battle,"If you're an all-out history buff like me, then you're gonna wanna read this book. It has a lot of details about American History in the mid to late 1700's and what life was like, especially during times of war and suffering. I would recommend this book to all the people I know, unless they're not into history like I am."
1,dull.,Totally forgettable remixes. David Morales really dropped the ball with this one. Even Aretha's vocal skills can't help. Truly disappointing.
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I purchased brand new one, it ate tapes. If I read the reviews from others, I would not buy it. Don't buy it. Waste time and money! I also wrote to the seller but no response from them... bad experience."
1,This should be a -5 star,"This is a piece of garbage. The button wouldn't stay down, it ate tapes, then the thing literally melted. I take care of my things and generally have very few problems with electronics. Not so with this cheap, rather expensive item. I will no longer buy any Maxell product, even their blank CD's and DVD's because of the poor quality I experienced with this rewinder. I threw it in the garbage but I really wanted to mail it to the CEO of Maxell with my opinion of it."
1,After 2 months I still cannot activate product,"I bought systemworks back in November and I still haven't been able to activate the product. Activating a product is something that you normally take for granted. Usually it's as simple as entering in a license key and you're product is instantly registered and working. Well for me, even after 80 hours on the phone with Norton support, uninstalling and reinstalling the product, cleaning out my registry, installing other product copies, and removing dsl and router firewalls I still can't activate my product! This is absolutely unbelievable! I'm a computer engineer and not a technophobe. How can a company sell a product that cannot be activated? Certainly this issue should have shown up during product QA! Judging by the amount of complaints of this product, I'm not in the minority here. In case this is a causing factor with the installation, I use SBC DSL, and a NetGear router and wouldn't recommend Systemworks 2005 for anyone with this setup."
3,Works OK For Me,"For the most part I like this program. It is the first time I purchased a systemworks package. I usually buy antivirus and utilities seperate. I used the rebate offered and had no problems. They actually paid very quickly. The only problem I had with the program involved the Norton GoBack Feature. For some reason, having the GoBack feature enabled severely slowed down my computer. But once I disabled GoBack and deleted it from my system everything else worked fine. The initial liveupdate was a bit slow but it downloaded a lot of updates. After that everything was fine. I am not really very computer literate so I hope this review helps someone else!"
1,This program ruin your computer. Avoid.,Do not install this on your computer unless you want everything to go wrong. Meaningless error messages. Unfixable bugs. Everything. I finally gave up after hours of struggling and being told that I would have to rewrite my registery. Norton Antivirus still does not work.
1,Bad bad bad,"Have had this product for two months. It has never worked correctly. I've uninstalled and installed twice, and this third time it won't even let me reinstall (error says I must reboot to complete the uninstall). And no customer support. I don't know what is better, but this is a waste of time and money."
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"If I could give this piece of crap no star I would. Installation wasn't a hassle. But it's such a system hog that the whole system slows down. System boot takes an eternity with this piece of crap - and my machine's a Pentium-IV running at 3 ghz and 1 GB of RAM!Worse, much worse, I've learned that, over time, this piece of dog poo ends up corrupting Windows. How exactly this happens, I have to confess, I haven't a clue. But one day, one day, you may just very well wake up to find Windows no longer works. (I'm no fan of Windows - I'm writing this on my ever reliable Mac - God knows XP has its problems as well. But mix these two together and you have a recipe for disaster.)I kid you not."
2,Horrible Installation,"I have used Norton programs for years and this is by far the worst one yet. The installation tried to unistall Norton Systemworks 2004. It failed, but managed to delete Password Manager after some confusing warnings. I had to download an uninstaller from Norton's website. Why couldn't they have included that in the 2005 installation?I was amazed at the number of strange error messages during install. The default install installs some of the programs, but not others. After activation, I had to run LiveUpdate 3 times and reboot after each one. I moved the Norton Systemworks folder to a sub-menu in the Windows Start menu and I got very strange errors. The KnowlegeBase at Symantec says I have to leave it in the default place to prevent errors.I expected more of Symantec."
1,I've given up on Symantec and Norton,"I've been a customer of theirs since the 1980s! It's been a long, slow slide south over these years, but now I'm finally throwing in the towel. They once set the standard. Now they are an embarrassment, and their products so bad it's an insult to their customers, old and new. Very sad."
4,easy to use and very useful,"Keeping in mind that this is a ""quick"" reference, this book is organised well and very easy to use. When learning XML I had it by my side many times and almost always found what I was looking for. My only comment for improvement would be a more comprehensive index and maybe some a more suitable cover design (I am constantly pointing people to the text on the cover in order to convice them this is a book about XML)."
4,Klassik Kinks,"The best Kinks LP save Village Green... and their first and best koncept album. Beware, some copies of this reissue have a version of Dave Davies' This Man He Weeps Tonight (stereo mix) which includes only one channel and sounds bloody odd as a result, I think they threatened to fix this for the second pressing. All the other bonus tracks are a real treat though - this is probably the best of the Castle reissues."
4,Funny and Thoughtful,"I enjoyed Jack on the Tracks. As always, Gantos creates a fun mix of humor and tragedy (read Jack's Black Book, the best in the series). To address one reviewer's comments: yes, Jack does accidentally kill his cats often. However, the book's approach isn't heartless. I recall Jack tried very hard not to cry in front of his family at the death of his pet. Writing about the death of household pets isn't neccesarily cruel. I don't think Gantos meant to include the subject matter as comedial; he probably found it realistic. How often does a pet-owner lose his pets to accidents? Probably not as often as Jack, but you see my point.That said, read the book."
2,Inconsistent flashes,"For the first couple weeks it worked ok, only sometimes flashed at consistent intervals at the really low setting. Now however, it's only consistent at the highest settings and hardly works at the lower ones. I guess it's what you get for the price."
4,elmo is a big hit,my 10 month old loves this book. i love it too!! it has so many flaps that she can open and we play peek-a-boo with the different characters. she even turns the pages herself. great book to have especially for an older toddler who will actually know and recognize the beloved characters of sesame street.
3,more flaps please,"Although there ARE a lot of flaps in the book, my daughter (19 months) loses interest in some of the pages because it is either not interactive enough (the shapes page) or it has TOO many flaps crowded together (the alphabet page). Overall it is a wonderful teaching tool for my child, but it doesn't keep my daughter's interest as well as some other flap books have."
2,not very sturdy,Received this in the mail and was very excited for my 17 month old because he loves elmo. When i first got it I had to open all the windows for the first time. Two of them ripped right away before even my son was able to touch it. He loves it but i wish that they had not been windows that you have to open and window tabs that are already opened for you. It was too much of a hassle to return it so I just kept it and may try to superglue the windows that ripped.
4,Great Book!,My 10 mo. old daughter loves this book and it's alot more durable than I thought it would be. She has ripped off some of the flaps but for the most part they are pretty strong. I definitely recommend this book to other parents especially for those whose children love Elmo!
5,Great book for any age,My little girl is not yet two and she loves this book. She loves Elmo and she will sit down with this book and open all the flaps longer than any other book. She obviously doesn't grasp the numbers/shapes yet but it still holds her attention. My son that is three also loves it and it is great for the learning aspects. Definately recommend this book!
5,The best service in the world.,I was not only pleased with the on line service butthe fact that the book turned up on time and notdamaged.
4,Truely Excellent!!!,"DJ Cam is by far the best French DJ on the scene. His use of Jazz and truely abstraKt beats and samples makes SUBSTANCES his most influencial effort. It lays the foundation for everything he has done since. It pays tribute to that which has influenced him most ...the NY underground... and brings to the table that which really makes him unique in the trip hop/hip hop arena. Check MAD BLUNTED JAZZ, THE BEAT ASSASSINATED and his Studio K7 mix...peace"
3,Good,Got it because I like horror movies. Plus Tracy Spiridakos is in it. She is so Beautiful that alone made me want to get it.
3,Not terrible but not great,"I am using this book for a class on ASP.net, so I didn't have much choice, but to buy the book. However, working through it I've learned alot. There are some problems I've run into though. For example when it says put some code into the Option tag, the author is assuming I know where to find the option tag. After quickly finding the option tag, I debugged fo 10 minutes before my teacher showed me that I had put the code in the wrong place.Also, There is no indication here that this is the first edition or second edition. This is good information to have, since my class requires the second edition."
2,A nation in denial,"The Germans said, ""We had no idea of what was going on (gassing, mass murder, violence against their neighbors, etc...)."" What a lot of nonsense!"
5,I'm totally hooked...,"This is by far the best CD I've bought this year. Yes it's abstract but there is an underlying sheer brilliance, maybe because I saw this piece performed live I was drawn in more easily but I purchased this cd the very next day and haven't stopped listening to it since. It's powerful, loud, grinding and orchestral at the same time. If you like the darker and more obscure sides of the Aphex Twin (e.g. selected ambient works vol II) or Throbbing Gristle's 'I.B.M.' off of their D.O.A. album then give this a listen."
1,NOT A SALAD PLATE!,"This was advertised as the salad plate for this china pattern, it was however the luncheon plate. A big difference for someone looking specifically for the salad plate. Very disappointing and a complete waste of my money."
4,A must see movie,I really enjoyed this movie. The characters was great and different. It had a nice twist to the storyline and a very good ending.
3,odwalla food bar snack,"These food bars are somewhat good. They are fruity and have substance so that you fulfill a void, but they are a little dry. I would enjoy them more if they were a little more moist."
3,Healthy.. not tasty,"This bar is certainly nutricious and packed with a lot of dried fruit, but the taste leaves something to be desired. It has a certain smell that doesn't make it that appealing as well.But it is a healthy snack every once in a while and it does come in handy when you're on the go and hungry."

3,"""Lucky..."" Is For Braid Fanatics Only","Lucky to Be Alive is merely a recording of Braid live. While it captures the energy and enthusiasm that these guys put on the road, it is hardly their ""swan song"". The packaging is a bit disappointing -- mostly pics of their van and not of them live. Don't buy this disc unless you've bought the others and can't get enough!"
1,Screw Metallica!,"After Metallica had 300 000 fans banned from Napsters, I can't stand listening to such a disloyal band!"
3,my misinterpretation,"i dont like this cd very much, but that was my own fault. in my eyes, Ministry is industrial. this CD is more techno or trance, or dance. im a metalhead so im not sure what you want to call it. i do like Shortest Straw and And Justice For All, thoughthe CD isnt bad if you like this kind of music, but it isnt the heavy kind of stuff that Ministry is. i wont give a cd that deserves a good rating a bad one because of a mess up on my side. i will keep this cd though :)"
1,WHY?,My reaction is simply why take one of the most gifted bands ever.... and turn there heard heart piercing riffs and low growling vocals soft... in my opinion it makes a mockery of metallica.... not a tribute....
5,"Very nice, but a little too snug for 15"" widescreen laptops...","My only complaint is that the 15"" is extemely snug on my 15"" HP laptop because I have a slightly wider screen. I literally have to shove it into the sleeve, so I don't use it very often. If you have a wide screen, consider getting the 17"" instead. Other than that, it is very well made and provides good padding."
2,Problems with this book,"The book is entitled Core Swing and I bought the book believing it to be so. However, it is not this. Rather it is a collection of chapters on very specific problems which are of limited relevance unless you wish to solve these very specific problems. I managed to extract a few things which I could generalise but really the book needs to be written in a much more general way and then modify the examples to be more general and put them in an appendix. I followed the procedures on customing DND to other components and could not make it work (I believe not bothering to do this will though). JTrees are used as an example for moving data between applications. Who would want to use this in such an obscure way?"
2,floodlight changer,"This changer holds the bulb very well, but does not have a very good way of releasing, especially when for a high ceiling."
1,I havent received,"i havent received these itens. I WILL BE WAITING. What that i have to do? there is something wrong, i cant wait more"
3,Veggies and potatoes are good..chicken.not so much!,"If your toddler is a good eater, these are a very good deal price wise. I paid $3.29 for one at my local store.That said, my granddaughter will not eat the chicken bits. I tasted them and ...not so hot! She eats the veggies and mashed potatoes and that is it. She is somewhat a picky eater but I am not sure it is her problem. I didn't like the chicken either."
1,Christian Horror Punk? Huh?,"This CD sucks so much I can't believe it. I bought this because I heard a bunch of people comparing them to the Misfits. Absolutely terrible. The music in general is bad enough already having NO originality, but the whole Christian thing just throws it over the edge. The lyrics try to mix zombies, death, graveyards, darkness, and...Jesus!"
1,"If you're avoiding the essentials, you'll try anything.","Drink only pure,unfluorided water, eat only whole fresh raw fruits and vegetables, exercise every day, get some morning or late afternoon sun everyday, and get enough sleep and rest. If this doesn't help, -then- start looking for the wierdo cures if you must, but nothing will undo the problems of the Modern Western Lifestyle except no longer living the MWL. I think Gabe must have been fasting a little too long when he wrote this book. Fantasy. To those who testify here on behalf of Tachyon products: I've happened upon a few 'Tachyonized' items, and gave them a try...nothing happened. Your results are the exception, not the rule."
1,Tachyon Energy: A New Paradigm in Holistic Healing,this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know from doing a little research on the web. It's just like the 'natural cures' book... you get it and inside it's just a big advertisement trying to get you to buy more... buy more. Try going to your local bookstore and ordering it from them. When they call you to pick it up just tell them you want to thumb through it first and make your decision from there. I mean unless you have piles of cash to burn. You don't need any flippin tachyon disks. Just start investing in some personal development. DO something and stop reading about it or buying things to do it for you. Invest in yourself. You'll never go wrong there.
1,High-Tech Pet Rock,"I think a tachyon exists, and I am excited about the idea, but there is no evidence of a patent on Tachyonization Process, and no evicende that the aura pictures are even real. If the technology worked, there would be a patent for it, the FDA would make them do trials, and it would take a year to get it onto shelves and into hospitals. Here's a pet rock that's an antenna for Tachyonized energy--someone's got to do the proof. I do not recommend Tachyonized products--especially the 15 drops of Tachyonized Water (from sugar)."
3,HEL-LO-O! Hadn't They Heard of Manic Depression in the 60s?,"This book succeeds brilliantly at depicting a child's-eye view of growing up in a dysfunctional family. Having yearned all through my own childhood for my manic-depressive mother to be like all the other mothers, I found it a painful reading experience.But I HAD to keep reading to find out if endearing Lucy survived--and she did (and so did I)! The book was very well written, but the sloppy editing jerked me right out of the story on several occasions.I, too, kept wanting to jump into the book and shake one of the adults until their head fell off! Why didn't someone drag that poor mother to a therapist?"
4,Written for the heart of the bereaved parent,"Deborah Davis did something for me that I needed...she validated my feelings about the entire ordeal my husband and I have gone through. We made the agonizing decision to induce labor to end the pregnancy after our baby was diagnosed with a terminal birth defect. I have been feeling guilt, anger, jealousy, despair, and fear about the future. Deborah Davis touches on all these issues in this book. Interjected throughout are personal testimonies from other parents who have gone through a loss, so it helps to know others have experienced the same feelings. The author also validates the fact that a loss is a loss, no matter if the baby died before birth or after. This is SO important for the reader to be told, I know it was for me.Nothing will bring back my baby, but this book has helped me throughout my grieving and healing process. I was hesitant about which book(s) to read, but now I know that I won't need to read anything else."
5,It helped me heal,"I loved this book! Even though I cried through much of it, it served a useful purpose. After never wanting to have children, I had a revelation that I needed to experience the joys of motherhood. I recently had a miscarriage with my first and much wanted pregnancy. I was a mess. This book helped me get over some of the loss I felt. I still feel sad often but realize that I'm not supposed to ""Just get over it, already!"" The book was honest, sad, hopeful, real, and made me totally feel like I was not alone in my grief. I am hopeful and anxious to finish this book by reading the chapters about trying again, coping with a subsequent pregnancy and birth, and the other chapters I know one day I will read when I feel ready to embark on the scary but exciting journey of pregnancy. I also feel compelled to share this with anyone who has gone through the death of a child. Thank you Deborah Davis, Ph.D. for the gift of this book!"
1,An Idiot's Surprise,"This is the kind of horror where the bad guy is lying on the ground and the scream queen on the run has an iron bar but misses his head when she tries to hit him even though the killer is half-dead. Then she just runs away. Everything is set down in a subway with about 4 characters. People stand with their backs turned near open windows while the killer is on the loose. Yeah, it is that bad. The story makes absolutely no sense."
1,Please don't do it.,"This is one of the most poorly scripted, acted and shot films I have seen in recent years.The start was fantastic, slick, stylish, full of promise.It was downhill from there.The story was weak, the 'Creep's' origins were vague and ill defined, the plot sketchy, the Creep himself not bad - but without motivation or anything I could pick up on.What a waste of what could have been a good story - turned it off mourning the time I had wasted, not a good movie, in fact probably infamous now for it's poor quality.Did he eat people? was he jealous of their perfection? Was he a science project gone wrong? The film left too many unanswered questions."
2,Forgot I Even Had This Film,"I got to be honest, this film is just another mediocre though competent torture/slasher film with a deformed antagonist, except he lives in London's sub-way, not in the woods by the lake, in your dreams, or busted out of the insane asylum. That is why I forgot I had it.The director (did a little research) got the idea for this film from ""An American Werewolf in London"" subway scene, which just by it's self is totally superior to this film.I'd be interested in his other films, but this one is a rental only.2 1/2 Stars = Fair"
4,excellent gore movie,sorry but creep is an excellent horror movie lots of gore blood and creeping section is very ok i've seen it twice already and the second vision is better i bought the england dvd before and i recommend this movie to all amateurs of gore bye marc
4,A different look at gun laws,Quite an interesting book.Lott will really upset the leftists with his views.But the point is.. It is the criminals who do the vast majority of killings with their guns.Taking the guns away from law abiding citizens only makes it easier for the bad guys.
1,not what I thought it was gonna be,They definately should have had pics of the inside of the bag...that way I would have known that it wasn't a case. If it would have been a case it would have been a beautiful one. So sorry to have to send it back...but totally not what I had expected.
3,Nice to read. (^_^),"A nice book which blends humor and mystery together. Quite enjoyable on the whole, as it always is seeing Blackie in action once again =P."
3,OK product,"OK product for the price. Based on the photo, I was expecting the fabric to be a little thicker but it does the job. Two key locks fit in easily (one McGard and one Gorilla spline lock). Definitely better than a ziplock bag."
5,Mc guard storage pouch,Storage pouch works great works like it should mounts on tire iron to keep it handy great idea wish I had one sooner
4,A Ridgerunner's Review,"I have read and reread this book many times, and have shared it with family members, friends and colleagues; I would say it's required reading for anyone interested in rural American folklore, and a good read for anyone interested in a good story. Of course, I admit to being biased, since I grew up in the heart of Tioga County, PA where the majority of stories come from! I enjoyed reading in print the stories that my father-in-law tells about growing up in Roseville. To this day, he swears the outhouse story is legit. You'll find many fascinating tales between the covers!"
2,JUST NOT QUITE RIGHT,"I WANTED TO HAVE GREAT THINGS TO SAY BUT UNFORTUNELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THIS BUS WAS VERY AGRAVATING TO MY DAUGHTER. IT'S HARD TO OPEN AND FALLS APART IF NOT DONE RIGHT. THE DOLLS DON'T FIT WELL IN IT,AND ARE HARD TO REMOVE ONCE IN. MAKING IT EASY TO FALL APART AGAIN. THE WIDSHIELD THAT OPENS UP WITH A CHANDLER FALLS OFF,ALONG WITH TOP THAT KEEPS COLAPSING DOWN AND THE BACK GATE THAT IS HARD TO CLOSE. I BOUGHT THIS ON SALE THROUGH AMAZON FOR FAR LESS THEN REGULAR PRICE. ($27.50) SO WE ARE KEEPING IT BECAUSE HOW DO YOU RETURN TO SANTA. BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND AT 27.50 LET ALONE ANY MORE."
5,Delightful night-time companions at a nice price,"Very clean, user-friendly, downright pleasant pillows, perfect for napping, sleeping, or even breakfast in bed. They'll never quite evince the magic, moldable fluffiness of a first-rate down pillow, but they're tops in a lofty loft-league of their allergen-free own."
2,Fence broke,I have hardly used this product and just noticed the fence was broken. The bolt holding the broken fence also broke off a piece of the table so I not only would need a new fence but the table piece as well. I just bought it last summer and hardly used the saw. Very disappointed but at least now I think I will look for something other than aluminum for those pieces...lesson learned.
2,Expecting some more,"I was expexciting more examples, and a fried description of each technique on a chapter. The book need to improve in order to make a match with the patient book.Adding some images to show or explains to the patients the objectives will make it better, and can be used as a extra material for the patient making the book more interactive."
4,the first mainstream chilean movie,"This movie spread interest for chilean movies in Chile, the movie bussines was at a low but this movie helped resurrect chilean cinema which from 4-5 movies a year in the mid 90's has leaped to over 20 in 2000.The movie is based on a real hostage situation."
3,interesting but predictable and far-fetched,"I had mixed feeling about this book when I finished it , so i decided to wait a few days and absorb what i read before writing a review. I then started comparing it to other mystery books and realized that this book is far from great.my first problem is how far-fetched the whole story is. Every mystery has a struggling dectective in it, but this guy's life is just unbeleivable. His whole divorce and separation from his daughter is completely over the top. He never abused them nor really treated them poorly, But yet they ""Refuse"" to ever talk to him again because he was a workaholic? The overall plot also took unbelievable twist and turns just for the sake of it. With all of this going on , the book was still predictable. 1/2 way into it, you can predict who will be killed by the serial killer and who will survive.Red Dragon is MUCH better."
3,The truth wiil set you free EHHHH and half the truth will make you money,It is nice to read this story but everything is hardly believable in my opinion however it shines some light on how the DeMeo's gang operated and his family is represented here some interesting facts about how the gang was like but I guess Dominick Montiglio wasn't really on the inside of DeMeo's crime life to tell so many facts and it is a nice readable book and they did a good job of making this book interesting
5,THIS IS ALL TRUE !!!,"I WANNA START OFF BY SAYING THIS ALL DID HAPPEN. BUT THE BAR WAS IN BROOKLYN, N.Y. NOT QUEENS. IF YOU MEET ANYONE OF THE GUYS IN THE BOOK YOU WOULD THINK WOW WHAT A NICE GUY, BUT DON'T LET THEM FOOL YOU THEY JUST WANNA GET TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN GET OUT OF YOU. THE BEST THING ANYONE CAN DO IS IF THEY FIND OUT SOMEONE IS A WISEGUY STAY A WAY. LIVE IN PEACE."
4,Informative and Intriguing,Goff's informal writing style makes this a readable book for the entomological novice or the crime solving professional. Every mystery novelist should read this book. The natural course of recycling is a wonderful process--I was reminded of the fleeting course of human life compared to the creatures who have lived on the planet for over 300 million years.
4,Autobiographical explanation of forensic entomology,"Goff is a forensic entomologist, basically someone who figures out how long someone has been dead by the insects on, in, or under the body. The book is a tale both historical and technical about the subject: historical in that it provides many examples of his work over the years, and technical in that he provides a good overview of just what he's looking for-which insects he expects to appear at what time.His style is clear and frequently understated, as when he relates that some of his colleagues were somewhat put out when it was found that one of his labs did not vent to the outside as it was supposed to.Anyhow, this is a fascinating if somewhat grisly read about an unusual but surprisingly significant subject. Just don't read it when you're eating!"
3,OK,"the product is OK, but there are better products on the market. My birds aren't too excited to eat it."
5,Great Multi-Purpose Bag,"This bag is just wonderful. I use them in my home to store cash, valuables, and important documents. Good size, fits in most compact safes and can be taped underneath furniture!I also use them to store audio equipment and cables. Really useful and they are cheap. Great value here folks."
1,Not suitable for money,"I bought this item to keep a case around the money that I put in my lockbox... It doesn't even fit in my lockbox! It's enormous. I wanted something that was just slightly bigger than the money I wanted it to contain but this is far too large. If size isn't an issue, these bags are made with quality and they could be exactly what you need for jewelry etc... but don't buy for money because even if you're not putting it in a lockbox like me, you're money will not stay organized in such a large bag."
5,Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!,"What a difference from the previous offerings. Harder, faster, heavier and frikin' killer!!!!!! Man what a change in direction here. Does changing the drummer make that much difference? I guess in this case it does as it allowed Priest to open up and expand on their riffage world. The cd is probably one of their best, in fact I'd say it's in the top 3. It's to bad metal was suffering from lack of attention in the early 90's as this cd would have been a huge success in the sales department had it been released a few years earlier. As it was, only the diehards were left to truly appreciate this metal masterpiece. Rob Halford saw the writing on the wall and split shortly after the tour finished up to try his own thing. Metal had died commercially, but musically, this is where it's at!!A true metal must have!!"
1,An embarrassment to Metal.,"What ... is this? It's like Spinal tap turned into a reality! I don't like any of Judas priest's music, but this is just plain [bad]. This album contains almost every Metal cliche you can possibly think of. Listen to this if you want to know WHY the market for traditional Metal dried up by the end of 1991. The only saving grace is Halford's voice.Oh, and I have something to say to all the metalheads out there: Wearing Judas priest tee shirts, obnoxiously shouting ""Up the irons!"" every five minutes, and mindlessly bashing Death metal and Black metal all the time does not make you ""real"" or ""true"". It just makes you a tool. Later."
3,not their best,"this is not priest's best, it's a pretty good album, to many bad songs to be their best like leather rebel, and metal meltdown, but the title track is probably their best song."
3,pain,"the painkiller is a ok album, my problem with it is it's to cheesy and goofy in spots, but overall it's still pretty good."
4,John Browning plays Mozart,"This is a lovely album, performances of three sonatas & and a fantasy with grace and sensitivity. The works on this album are (1) Sonata in F, K. 332, (2) Fantasia, K. 475, (3) Sonata in C minor, K. 475, and (4) Sonata in F, K. 533.Curiously, the CD lists this album as ""Volume II"", although I have not been able to locate ""Volume I"" or any other volume of this series."
4,2cds It's Gotta Be Good,"Out of 31 tracks, 6 good songs. The best one's are ""Tonight It's On"" & ""Country Spic"". It's an alright cd to check out."
1,"Don't touch this ""Machwerk""","Please do not buy this DVD. This DVD is very bad and in no case helpful if you want to make a trip to New York. The movie was made with a wiggly camera in winter to spring; the Central Park without any leaves on the trees looks very strange. The music is kludgy, on the cover you will find mistakes in writing, write errors you will find in some of the film titles, too. I was so disappointed that I removed the DVD after not more than 30 minutes from my DVD player."
3,I love this book light UNTIL,"the wire or the plug goes bad. I'm on my third itty bitty book light in a year. AT $30+, the plug or wire shouldn't go bad when all you do is plug it in. I'm an avid reader; I read in bed every night. I don't like batteries, and this book light is the only one that's bright enough for me. The problem is that the wire usually breaks inside the casing. At least, I think that's what happening. Eventually, for the light to work, I have to arrange the wire and plug ""just so"" in order for it to work. If I happen to move (and sometimes breathe), the light goes out. This is extremely frustrating. If anyone knows of another plug in book light that doesn't present this problem, I would love to know so that I can quit wasting my money or giving it to a company that doesn't care. Yes, I've changed the light bulb."
2,others,"instead of buying this one, opt for a Rayovac booklight...they've got one with a pillow bottom, and another that had a string for around your neck...much better than it's itty bitty alternative"
1,Alas,"I have had a series of itty bittys over about 20 years. At first they were great - the light shed was bright and well focused. But over the years the product has deteriorated - light bulbs bought in recent years blew out quickly; I went through several AC adapters; and I also had to replace the frame itself several times as parts of it failed. All replacements were relatively expensive as well as bothersome. So I have moved to a Mighty Bright, which is working well both at home and for travel. The AAA batteries that power it are not expensive or cumbersome and last a long time."
2,nice light while it lasts - bad wiring,"Love the light, while it's working. I've bought several of these over the years and each one has died in the same way: the wiring that attaches to the light itself fails, the light works for a short time if I hold the cord ""just so"", then it eventually doesn't work at all. The connection just isn't robust enough. I agree with other reviews - for this amount of money, they should improve the wiring and it would last a lot longer. I'm going to try the other lights recommended by the other reviewers."
2,not exactly what i paid for...,"for the money i paid for these tables, i would expect a higher quality. the wood top is quite nice and melds well with my decor, as well as the metal base, but the quality is not great. they aren't balanced very well and seem a little more ""rickety"" than i had initially hoped. not the best for the price.."
3,"Eh, just O.K.","This looks nicer than my old $15 table from Ikea, but I'm not thrilled with the quality. None of the metal pipes join properly, the table base leans to the left (oddly, the top is level), and the plastic feet glued onto the base actually make friction on carpeting so it only slides well on the hard floor. I'll probably try to pry those off myself. For the bargain price of $33, I'll keep it. However, the beginning price of $125.99 is utterly ridiculous! For that much money, all the seams should join properly. Coaster claims to make ""quality"" furniture, not GOOD quality furniture."
4,OLD CLASSIC TV SHOWS,I bought these videos for my sister for christmas. We always remembered watching the series on and off as kids and liked it. She was very excited to see I got her the first three seasons. She loves to watch DVD's.
3,Nice camera but software is not easy to use,Nice camera. Takes great pictures that we can develop at Coscos or other outlets. Its just a shame that the software is so difficult to use
2,Worked great for five hours,"I loved this camera when I first started with it-it was easy to set up and start taking pictures right away. My impression was that the body of the camera was rather flimsy, however, the picture qality was very good for my purposes. I took some pictures of my work, used the software to edit them, printed them out, and now these pictures are in my portfolio. Sometimes it seemed finiky- you had to push a button two or three times to enter what you wanted. But, in general, it worked great for a couple of hours. Then, the camera just quit! Can't charge the battery, can't use the lithium batteries, nothing! The lense will not retract into the body of the camera when it is off. The only life I get from it is a very brief (half a second) display that says ""Camera needs service"" before it goes dead again. I don't know, maybe I just got a lemon, but if I could afford a pricier camera with all of the DX3600 features, I would probably get it."
4,Very Useful,"I don't know about you, but I have neither the financial resources, time, or particular desire to try and keep up with the novels. FASA realizes this, so they give us Shattered Sphere.Basically, this book is a status update, similar to the long-out-of-print 30-year Update book, published just before the Clans appeared. It doesn't go into great detail on anything, but is very general about everything. It's told from the point of view of Victor Steiner-Davion's intelligence chief, so there is a bit of bias there (i.e. Draconis Combine's okay, but the Capellans and Katherine Steiner-Davion are EVIL).It's a very, very handy book. It should be a required purchase for anyone who owns Mechwarrior 3rd edition, and if you're at all interested in the politics behind the universe, for Battletech fans, too. If there'd been more (like, say, if it'd been twice the size), it'd've gotten five stars."
2,Yuck!,"I love Boba, but when I recieved this product- one of the bags the seal was broken and the pearls were desintegrated. When I opened the other bag these also fell apart. The color and texture were not what I had recieved before when I mail ordered from another company. (Can't find them now.)Since I paid alot to mail them, I just took it as a loss. Not worth the time and trouble to mail back. I would not recommend this stuff."
1,-500 stars,"This is a CD by a man that obviously thinks he is God's gift to modern music. The comparison to Rich Mullins is totally uncalled for. Just because they both play a hammer dulcimer does not warrant a comparison. Rich was a phenomonal musician and mind-blowing songwriter. Pheyland is a mediocore musician and a mind-numbing (i.e., BORING) songwriter. I would rather listen to a person using the restroom than listen to this ""album""...On the second thought, I believe they are the same thing."
5,very cherry,"Just what I wanted, not too sweet, not to tart, cherry, gummy...same as the ones in germany. the twelve packages in a box is easy to store."
3,More Energy!,I dodnt regret buying this CD. It would have been better with more popular songs. The other thing that annoys me is when these types of CD's often do slow breaks in between some of the songs. Keep the energy level high!
