3,Too many Politics,"The book is very good, especially when the action is happening. The author did a very good job building the ""picture"" for the reader. Even though setting the stage is important, the use of politics of was over done. The other item that I found distracting was the lingo that the Natives used at time (It was 100% American born) The natives would have had thier own style and would not have unterstood or used some of the text use in thier speech. You saying, well there was english teachers on the planet. Well if anyone has lived overseas they will know that people even when they do know english, the lingo is not there. Nit picking, but I found it as a distraction in the book on many occasions, especially when you wrap it in with politics.The first half of the book is just a bit slow and sometimes not believable, the second portion was VERY good."
1,NO Suds,"You get what you pay for. I bought this as it was a great price. However, I saw more suds from my dishwashing soap. This formulation wasn't even good enough to wash my lawn mower. Not impressed at all. For a comparable brand try the Wash and Wax from Turtle Wax."
4,Sure to be a Hit on Broadway,"1. to correct a previous commentor... the cast on this album is NOT the cast that is performing the US tour, and will NOT be the cast on broadway. this album is the 1999 UK cast. there was an entirely new cast brought in for the US tour.2. i saw the show in minneapolis and thought it was wonderful. i have not heard the 'original cast' (1996), so i cant compare the difference in the shows, but the version i saw showed plenty of promise to be a hit when it reaches broadway. the singers were awesome and the choreography was amazing.see this show!buy this album!-- or wait for the broadway cast album to come out"
5,BETTER VOICES- BETTER LYRICS-BETTER VERSION,"When I bought the Original London Cast recording of Marti Guerre, I was disappointed. Where were the power voices? There are no Lea Salonga or Colm Wilksinson style voices. Rebecca Lock-I'm sorry but there is a reason she was the understudy. No voices stuck out.. The new version however, let's the vocalist actually be heard and it looks like they actually did a bit of casting this time instead of letting everything that walked in the theatre be in their show. Thank heavens, too. Joanna Riding is awesome and the new Martin and Arnaud are phenomenal. The new lyrics better tell the story and the loopholes I found in the first one have been filled by the new version. In short, the new version is beautiful and has the better voices. If you are looking for more orchestral music and don't care about shrill voices with no distinction than the 1996 cast is for you. If you enjoy outstanding voices and a little less orchestral, than the new 1999 cast is for you."
5,Buenisimoooo,"Antes de comprar este cinturón tenia elSchiek 2006 Leather Lifting Belt - 6 Inchpara mi era el mejor cinturón,aunque es muy grueso y el cuero durísimo, pero baje de peso y me quedaba grande, decidí comprar este cinturón por que me parece que schiek es de las mejores marcas, este cinturón es liviano, fácil de llevar en mi maleta y me proteje la espalda baja. lo recomiendo para hacer ejercicio."
4,In the mood fo shorts?,"Shorts are usually different than full-length movies in several ways, and this is that way. You should find some films here that you can enjoy when you want to watch something different!"
5,Marvelous cookbook.,"I love the recipes in this cookbook. I've had it about two years now, and I've made nearly all of them. I love that my muffins come out like a fancy bakery creation, just heavenly. They're not simple recipes, but they turn out worth every bit of extra effort."
3,Nice pictures,"I returned this book because after going through it when I got it, I found only a few recipes I'd probably want to try. Pictures are beautiful. I felt it was expensive for 40 recipes when I'd probably only try a few. I prefer more every-day type of muffins."
4,Well worth the purchase!!!,"Even though there are no vocals on Barbra's part (and it is not authorized by her), it is still a very nice collection of theme songs by different symphonic orchestra's around the world. Well worth the minimal cost... a nice addition to anyone's collection."
3,What happened to some really good songs?,"I love the music of Rent, and if this disc had my two fav songs on it it would have gotten 5 stars. Hw could you not include ""Over the Moon"" and ""Your Eyes""? I loved those songs! For shame! I do happen to like how all the dialoge is cut out, however..."
3,Buy the Full Soundtrack!!,"While this soundtrack features many of the tracks that make Rent a hit, it fails to include many of the key tunes of the play. If you are debating whether to buy this album or the full soundtrack, definitely buy the two-disc set. Not only does it include a booklet of lyrics and pictures, but it includes all of the musical numbers in the piece. Basically, in the two disc set, the entire play is recorded with the exception of some dialogue between the songs. While this CD gives you a taste of Rent's magic, the play can be appreciated more with the two-disc set."
2,Not what I expected...,"With a Title like 365 Manners I expected it to be in a format that you would use each day with tips, tricks and games for each day. Instead, it reads like a calendar read except it only has games and activities for each sub title of manners, one section is on holidays...not manners or etiquette just a rundown of what each is and means...I was very disappointed with this book an do not recommend it!"
5,Great Book For A Pre-Teen!,"I bought this for my 12 year daughter and she has learned much from this book already. Each days entry is short, sweet and to the point. Great for kids!"
4,Great book!,"I'm using this book as part of homeschooling my preschoolers. It is great to get ideas from, and the children love learning and practicing new manners. This book not only serves for the good of my children, but also in reminding me of certain things as well. Family life has been much more pleasant since implementing the ideas in this book. My only complaint is that it should have been organized by topic and had tabs for quick reference. Otherwise, it's a good book if you take the time to look for what you want."
3,Great but Poor video in Low Light,"I had a Sony and was very satisfied, so got this one a week ago. This is a very handy little camera and takes great video.There is only one problem. The video in low indoor light is very poor."
2,Too Much Motor Noise,"I totally agree with the reviewer from Harrisburg,Pa(June 24). The SonyDCRHC40 that I purchased from Best Buy had too much motor noise for my liking. Of course, the motor noise occurs when a tape is in the camcorder and is recording or playing. It was my luck that the camcorders at Best Buy were locked where the tape goes in for security reasons and when I turned on each of the Sony camcorders without a tape in them, there was no noise. So I bought the SonyDCRHC40. When I began taping a dance recital the noise was terrible. I was charged a restocking fee to return that camcorder and then told that ALL camcorders make the motor noise. Well, I am now trying a tape in each camcorder I look at and there are camcorders that do not make the noise that came out of the Sony. So, buyers beware. Try the camcorder with a tape in it before you make the purchase."
3,Bulkier than I thought it would be.,"This will come in handy if I lose my original cord or if a visiting family member forgets their cord, but it is bulkier than I thought it would be."
1,Junk - lasted 2 days.,Great idea but I have had this for about 2 days and one of the retractable cords has already broken! I haven't even had a chance to leave the house yet!Would not work on my ASUS Eee PC 904HA netbook either. You need to make sure your power source is 19 V. Anything less or more with not work.And to be honest this thing is still a bit bulky...$42.00 is WAY to much for this gadget.
3,Almost like it...,"The game is interesting, but there are a couple of issues that make it painfull to play this game. I agree with many other reviews that the puzzles are either 'moronic' or 'rocket science' and that the voices and character movements simply suck. Otherwise, I wish the game had more detail and was longer."
3,Songbook,"This product was in good shape as indicated, but I was disappointed to find out that two songs had been cut out of the book. I was very glad they were not the specific songs that I was looking for, but it was not indicated anywhere that the book was incomplete. I certainly would have chose another seller's book had I know that. Please be honest in your description of the object you are selling. If the songs had been listed that were not in the book I could have decided if I wanted this specific book or not. Otherwise everything went well and I am most happy to have the ""rest of the book""."
4,Great movie...and an even greater selection of music,"The music made the movie! I could not wait to get on-line at Amazon.com and order 'For Love of the Game!' The great thing about the soundtrack is of course there is more of the songs that made the movie...in other words, no ""edited"" versions of the songs that are dropped in throughout the movie. If you go to the movie...stay until all the credits are done (3 best songs!). If you have already seen it and didn't stay through the credits, go again...or savor the cd. I dare you to see the movie and NOT buy the soundtrack. I don't think it can be done. Enjoy!"
3,Musicas faltantes,"A m'suica do Bob Seger - Against The Wind, n?o faz parte da trilha, mas toca no filme em um momento muito importante!!"
3,overpriced flimcy,"the collector was overpriced, plus shipping was $8 by itsself and pretty flimcy. I wish i could return it. a. m."
3,Incredible oversight,Everything is just fine with this cd except for a great oversight. It doesn't contain Eenie Meenie which is THE hit that Mr Osborne is fondly remembered for. Duh.
4,So this is where The Beach Boys went...,"When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena. I pulled off and bought the CD. I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed ""Right Kind of Girl"". There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. ""Your Big Night"" is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. ""Star Behind"" may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement. My fave track is ""All Dreamed Out"". It is a Satin Doombox."
5,Great Pans,My wife has two other Circulon pans of different sizes and she loves them.This pan is a great addition to our kitchen.
4,Product Description & Review,"Product Description:This is a Japan only-pressing edition. So I'm sure in america you won't get much chance to get this release. It costs around 28 dollars in Japan (exactly 3150 yen w/tax). It's a really great package, contains 1 CD & 1 DVD.CD:All 13 track from the reissued edition of Oral Fixation V2.Plus a Don't Bother Remix (jrsnchz remix) which is pretty good. Total 14 tracks.DVD:Contains 2 videos: Don't Bother & Hips Don't Lie. Of course the package is really exclusive, remembering Hips video isn't released officially.If you want to search it, the cover is exactly the same with Hips Don't Lie CD-Single (only the outcover, the booklet still same with audio CD edition). Don't be confused. If you a realrealreal big fan of Shakira, YES, I recomend this extremely-exclusive package for you."
3,its okay,"This book is all right. It is informative, funny and a little boring and stupid. I think it's worth reading. Probably not buying, but reading."
4,Digimon's Best book,"If you want a realy cool book to read, Pick this book its the best Ive ever read."
5,Lemh,Great book as usual from Nora Roberts. She does such a good job of building the charcatures that you feel like part of the family.
5,Luring a Lady,A really good Nora Roberts book. This story focuses on Mikhail Stanislaski and the woman he falls for: Sydney Hayward. Sydney is the new owner of the building Mikhail lives in. They set off sparks when he confronts her with problems in the building....the rest you should read for yourself. Not to be missed by Nora Roberts fans.
4,Sudden Death,"this movie is about a fireman (van damme) who has to save a hockey arena from being blown up by terrorists. He also has to save the vice president (hostage) and his daughter who was kidnapped by the team mascot.he has to defuse all the ten bombs placed around the arena and fights many of the main villains men who attack him. There is some good fights here, the acting isn' too good but is a good movie for van damme fans or action fans."
2,"Great, while it worked","This zapper delivers great power and that satisfying ""pop"", but that lasted only for 2 weeks. Its build is too fragile and the button sensitivity decreased gradually but quickly, and now they no longer respond."
3,The creepiest installment of the Shadow Series,"I'm writing this after having read all 3 of the 'Shadows' series books. This is the 2nd of 3 and tells the story of a friend of Bishop's. I definitely found it the creepiest of the series, and also the least romance-focused. I gave it a 3 because I thought it was a good story, but I fully admit that my biggest draw is the romantic element. I'd give both of the other 2 'Shadows' books 5s...suspenseful & romantic!"
5,Highly recommend,"Ms. Hooper's ""shadow"" books are some of the best psychic mysteries around. They are more credible than most. I enjoyed them all thoroughly and if you like one, you will like them all."
4,Is like a scary ride through every page!,This book will keep you wondering every second. You will Stay up to 5 am finish it! It is worth reading it twice
5,Floor Light,I am very pleased with the Pro Track floor light. It is small enough to fit almost anywhere in the living room. I plan to order another floor light in white.
1,Cheap goggles,"If you'r thinking to buy this goggles to play airsoft...... DON'T DO IT. The materials are cheap, don't even have the standars of quality like ANSI Z87.1-2003+ and US MIL-V-43511C. Be carefull and think about your safety."
3,Looks good - but has quality control problems,"This hood is a big improvement over the 20 year old model it replaced, but I had a few problems with it:- the two hood lights were wired incorrectly, so it was impossible to turn them on and off without unscrewing the bulbs. Luckily I enjoy tracing wiring around and was able to fix it, but somebody isn't doing the product testing at Broan.- one of the spot welds had popped open, so there is a slight grin on one side. You can't see it from across the kitchen, but it's kinda annoying for me since I know it's there- the plastic mounting fixture for the damper broke when I was trying to reseat the damper with a screwdriver, so now I can't install the damperDespite these problems, the hood still works and looks fine, but it's disapointing that the quality control on the product was so poor"
3,"Motor hums, light bulb diffuser rattles","It's an inexpensive range hood, and you get what you pay for. It's not awful, but not great either.For use with a ducted exhaust, scored panels must be removed but the ""perforations"" are very strong, I had to use a Dremel and a cutting wheel to cut them free. Tinsnips might also work, but don't plan on removing these with bare hands.No matter what speed is selected, even the slowest, the motor has a loud hum.On higher fan speeds, the plastic diffuser that covers up the light bulbs rattles like crazy. If you put your hand on the diffuser the rattle goes away, so you can either wedge something in there to hold it tight or just throw away the diffuser.Unless I'm missing something, the metal mesh protecting the fan from grease splatters etc seems to require a butter knife to remove.Other than these issues, it works well. Moves plenty of air, the sheet metal is sturdy, and the rest of the build quality seems adequate."
2,branded dvd,the problem with this cd is that you can not skip from episode to episode making it almost useless.
3,You forgot about commercials.,"Each episode is only 22 minutes long because there are no commercials. If you purchase a season of an hour long show, you will discover it lasts 50 minutes. It's not editing people."
3,Poorly constructed but with some good performances,The bones of a good idea and a few very good actors make this much more watchable than it should be for such a poorly constructed story.
5,Powerful,"This is a powerful movie. For those who don't like subtitles, don't worry...you won't even notice (it's only partially subtitled) Lots of emotion, history and a great story based on reality of the 40's"
3,"Good Film, but... (SPOILER)","I really enjoyed this film. Well, MOST of this film. I seem to feel this way about a lot of Hollywood films and thought I wouldn't have the same problem with Sarah's Key, but I did. Film had me, I was engaged, engrossed, and then it happened. The ridiculous end. I honestly felt they ran out of time and money. Yes, I know films aren't shot in sequence, but whenever the ending was shot, they botched it and botched it royally. The reveal was horribly acted, the camera was stuck on one shot for the longest time. It felt like the director took lunch while they were shooting it and editing it. I recommend the film for the first three quarters and then just shut it off. Not knowing the end or seeing the end will be better for you than watching all the way through."
5,An excellent book.,"I was one of the few people in my medical school class that liked this book. I used it as a supplement to my class notes and pharmcards to study for pharmacology. I used it in addition to FirstAid to study for the boards. I found it to be excellent. I like the outline format. I found that it hit upon the pertain side effects and interactions, and I liked the organization. Mechanism of action descriptions were adequate for nearly all questions I was asked. Most in my class used the Lippicontt Illustrated Reviews Pharmacology book. But, they weren't #1 in their class for both Pharm I and Pharm II in medical school. I was. It is a good book. It is a little old now, and is certainly over-due for a new edition. I hope they come out with one. This book presents the facts concisely without a lot of fluff. Give it a shot. And, its cheaper."
3,"Good, but too detailed","This is a good supplement to class notes and First Aid for pharm if you need to go above and beyond. However, it is very detailed compared with other titles in the BRS series. I found it too detailed for my pharmacology class and too time consuming for board prep."
3,Half way,Don't get me wrong BRS series has some very good books. But this pharmacology just did not cut it with me. It was just miles and miles of text and tables with very few graphics. I did not want to just randomly memorize the information I wanted to understand it. I honestly gave this book a try when I was studying for my step 1 but I ended up getting Kaplan pharmacology flash cards and reading Lippincott's pharmacology 4th edition and had much better time reviewing and great results on the test. This BRS book was just not up to par for me.
1,Will anyone want to?,"Awful. AVOID!. All bad copies. I thought a remix was something that had already been made by an artistist and then given a reworking. Not just by some unknown. These sound home made. I bought it thinking it was done by the original artists. I now have it hanging outside to keep squirrels of the bird table. It looks great twinkling in the sun. (When we have some). Again, save your money and AVOID!"
5,The best book for who wants to know the real physiology,"This book is the most comprehensive , easy to read and complete book I`ve read.I suggest this book for who wants to study physiology deeply."
3,Wanted to be very scared,"I'm no professional reviewer, so here's my basics about this movie:Caty Lotz: Where the hell are her other movies?! I'll be searching right after this review. I liked her acting, her eyes, hair, and most of all the cleft in her chin.The plot: Not bad. A slight surprise made it refreshing. Not sure what the pact was.Scary?: Had it's moments. Nothing new really. Much like most recent horror films. This movie will probably make you jump once or twice.Casper Van Dien: Love this guy. He and Viggo Mortensen are probably related somehow based on their chins alone.Overall: Still have not been really scared by a movie in a long time. This one didn't do it although I liked the movie. The Grudge came close 8 years ago."
4,I liked it,Not bad movie. But they just don't make scary movies like they use to. Simple and easy to buy and stream to my tv. Laptop or iPad through amazon instant video.Story line was interesting and kept my attention to see what happens be next
4,Decent story with a vague ending,"This was a good thriller, but the ending left me a bit wanting. It was so sudden and lacked cohesion that I was not really sure what the final message was."
4,WHO MADE THE PACT,"Like most reviewers, I question why this movie's title THE PACT doesn't fit the film?!THE PACT is a ghost story and a tantalizing mystery hybrid. Writer/director Nicholas McCarthy uses dim lighting, ominous shadows and eerie music to unravel a tale of deception, revenge and dark family secrets. Caitey Lotz is very good as the younger sister who reluctantly returns to her homeplace to attend her mother's funeral. Upon arrival, she discovers her older sister (Agnes Bruckner0 has inexplicably vanished, leaving her young daughter in the care of cousin Liz. When Liz likewise disappears and Annie is attacked by an unseen force, she turns to a dissolute detective (Casper van Dien in a restrained performance) and a young psychic woman for help in solving the mystery.THE PACT does move leisurely, but I got involved anyway. There are some plot inconsistencies and a puzzling final shot, but overall I find THE PACT to be a decent rental option."
5,the future of indie rock?,"ok, 'dare to be surprised' was an inconsistent disappointment... but this is a truly great album. every song is replete with original grooves, instrumentations, lyrics, and, oh yeah, the pop hook. lou's voice has never sounded more beautiful. this album is definitely a positive turn after the disappointment of 'the sebadoh.' and let me remark that the album has a sonic crispness... the sounds on this album are like hearing the drops of rain as it gently falls down on a forest. truely gorgeous. this is 'pet sounds' without the fuss, a retro-futuro mix of analog and digital technologies."
1,Icky taste in my moot...,"Aweful, just plain aweful; I took a chance and was expecting a bit of Pavement, with a touch of Stereo lab, and just-a-sprinkle of Nick Drake. Instead, I got two third-graders lost in a experiment with instruments that 'muffy & puffy' purchased for them and failing miserably in their quest for harmony. I searched, I thirsted for good lyrics; needless to say, I went elswhere to quench my parched 'throat' and heal my musical spirit..."
4,Everyone who sees this wants one,"My wife and I are always cooking, and this simplifies measuring and dispensing butter a lot. Everyone who sees it in use wants one.I've read some complaints that it won't cut though the butter, but we've never had that problem. We keep our butter in the fridge at 40 degrees F, and it is fairly firm, but this cuts through it .... like butter.I dinged the ButterMate one star (would've only dinged it a half-star if I could) because this purchase is to replace one belonging to my sister-in-law that broke around the hinge on the little door. When you want to open the door to dispense, you squeeze down on a lever and the door pops open with a fair amount of force and I think the hinge can't take the shock after a while. On the other hand, I always hold my finger on the door as it opens and therefore it doesn't slam open--and we've been using the same one for 5 years or so. Nearly every day. So with some TLC, this guy should last you for a while."
3,Broke AGAIN!,"I love the idea, but I have been through two already. The company needs to find a better (more durable) design. This item has the potential to be the best kitchen gadget ever, but as it is now, I won't be repurchasing."
2,Arrived broken and kinda melty,"When this arrived, I was really excited, but the feeling faded fast. I ordered the three sets that I needed to complete the series, and two of them were damaged.Season 2, volume 2 came in with broken hinges and missing parts. The plastic on season 1, part 2 seemed to have melted in the delivery process and is now rippled and kind of sticky feeling. As a collector, I don't like that at all.I haven't had a chance to play any of the discs yet, but two of them look heat damaged.I wouldn't recommend buying from this seller in the summer. Or at all, really. The condition of the sets just irks me in a way I can't put into words.If you're the kind of person who can ignore superficial damage, go for it. If you're a nit picky collector like me, just...don't."
1,True about all the bad comments!,"I received one of these and it's true about the leaking on the counter. I just thought I spilled some water the first few times but then i dried up the bottom after filling it and still had leakage. This is poorly made. Also, I accidentally broke the carafe (which is very thinly made and more delicate than other glass carafes I've had from past machines). So I called Delonghi to get a replacement....they quoted me $45 for a new carafe! Totally bad item all the way around."
1,Not worth the money or headache,"Loved it until it started leaking water all over the countertop after 1 month. Although it's under warranty, I need to pay to send it 1000 miles away to a service center and will be without it for unknown amount of time. Also, can't send just the tank portion (which visibly drips water when filled). I have to ship the whole unit...of course, the box has been recycled. Definitely not worth the money."
2,Not recommended,"I received this cofee/espresso maker as a gift for Christmas 2008. It is leaking from the bottom now and it seems that it's been leaking for a while. I see that a review from 2007 complains of this too. Anyway, I am in NJ and wheelchair bound. I called Delonghi and they want me to get it to Brooklyn or Long Island. I don't think so. This problem seems to have existed for years and they have not addressed it."
1,Too many problems - avoid this item.,"I have to agree with the other reviewers for this product. This is not a good expresso/coffeemaker. Don't even consider getting it. The coffeemaker side quit working just three weeks after I bought it. We've had other problems with this unit which the other reviewers have pointed out. The frother is useless. It doesn't froth well, and the way it's constructed, you can't get a tall or even medium size pitcher of milk to froth effectively. Our unit leaked water as well. After it quit, I returned it and got a refund. I would rate it zero stars if I could."
3,Satisfied,"No complaints. Had my first one for three yearsThen it started leaking water then shorted out the heating element,Hopefully this one will last just as long or longer."
2,De Longhi,I never have had any problem with online shopping... but must say that all the bad luck came with this product.Twice had to return as after the first cup of coffee it stopped working!
1,Coffee side stopped working after a few uses,"Received this as a Christmas gift. The expresso/cappucino side works ok. The coffee side did work for a few uses, but has now stopped working. DeLonghi agreed to repair the item, but I have to mail it to a repair center at my cost. If it wasn't a gift from my kids, I would trash it."
1,leaky little devil,"I bought this item second hand off someone in town. I have to say it has leaked from the start. But I just put a towl underneath it, no big deal for me. I was a broke college student- at the time I couldn't afford to try another one. The leaking never really bothered me as long as i kept a towl there. The coffee was always good and so was the espresso shots. I've ran a coffee shop for 5 years, I know coffee. I never used the steam wand so who knows how well that works... But after having it second hand for over a year it has sprung another leak. The first leak was from underneath it and the second leak is now between the espresso head and coffee pot. I still use it every day- but I am worried it is going to go kamakazi and take down the whole house."
1,Not worth it.,"We received this as a wedding gift. The first one didn't work at all. Nothing happened when it was plugged in. We figured it was just a dud and exchanged it for a different one. This one works, but it leaks water out of the bottom. Not a little bit either. After you use it, there is a puddle of water underneath."
2,Overpriced underperformer,"As an allergic asthmatic with dogs, a ""hospital grade"" HEPA vacuum with intense suction seems to make a great deal of sense--even if it does cost more than the competition.Turns out it doesn't pick up dog hair from carpet even with an infinite number of passes. Turns out the filter needs to be changed at high cost after a short period of time (you'll know when it's due because the recirculated air will smell like a warm diaper pail breathing from inside your machine).To boot, you get all this in a package that looks as though it's straight from the 1979 design bin."
1,Worst of the worst,"Do not buy this without checking it out in a store. Compare it to NEC, Sony, and Viewsonic. If it still looks good to you buy it. Then get your glasses checked."
4,give it a chance,"...weve all heard these songs on the radio, on MTV, or wherever...i admit, i didnt like 99% of these songs, but then again, its just not my music...i do however really like these covers...yellowcards cover is among the best, and the covers of survivor, im real, and all or nothing are really amazing....if you like pop/punk in the vein of blink 182 and sum 41, check this one out"
2,hmmmm......,"Some of the songs on this CD are OK, and some are actually pretty good....but most of the songs sound WAY to much like the original....which is bad. The better songs on this CD are Rufio's cover of ""Like A Prayer"" and The Starting Line's cover of j-lo's ""I'm Real"" and Yellowcards version of ""Everywhere"". Those songs are definately worth a listen but if i could, i wouldnt buy this CD again because it's just not worth it. there really isnt that much good stuff on here."
3,THe only reason to get this is for SAS.,"The only and single reason i would recommend this CD is for the Stretch Arm Strong cover....they never dissappoint, by far one of the greatest hardcore bands in the scene, if not ever."
1,Back to the drawing board,"This song was horrible! Horrible music that overshawdow what the song was about. Nick pretty much talks about how a girl's father hates him because he has money, a big house, fame and the normal stuff that most rappers (Cash Money) talk about (except getting tons of girls). Lets hope that rest of the album is better than this."
4,"Quirky, odd, strange little movie with aspirations..","Ignore the cover displayed as it makes the move appear to be be a babe exploitation flick from the 60's and has no connection with the film.Honestly would never have seen this but I enjoy off-beat films and Amazon was nice enough to place it on the prime movie list.An odd tail of the end of earth/time with a bit of style, humor and wit. I can understand why many will hate this little flick, my wife would have hit me until I flipped it off if she were present when I watched it. But if you enjoy the independent sifi/metaphysical film written with a bit of intelligence, humor and direction you may enjoy this as I did.Best,Joe"
2,Wacky,Definitely put this film at the bottom of your prime free viewing list. Perhaps if you are stoned this movie might make some sense...
1,Quality Assurance is a joke!,"I reently ordered this item. Actually 2 weeks ago, and I still haven't used it. Why? Because one of the pots came scratched and when I called Farberware about it, like it states in their Quality Assurance brochure to do, they told me it was Amazon's problem. According to their brochure if you open your order and find a defect they will replace it. They don't. And when you call them to ask for a replacement they are rude and insulting. So now I have a new cookware set that I can't use until I ship the whole thing back to Amazon and get my replacement. Multiple E-mails to them have also remained unanswered. I wouldn't waste my time with Farberware since you'll obviously never get the Quality Assurance that they give."
5,Must have,This is a must have for any STAR TREK fan. A very useful guide filled with vast amounts of info makes it an essential tool for navigating your way through the STNG series.
2,"Great photos, terrible text","This book is a great concept; unfortunately it was not executed well. The design is crowded and jumpy. The text desperately needs a copyeditor. DESPERATELY. The whole thing lacks professionalism. The author is a fan, yes, but he should've worked with someone on this who knows what they're doing. Lots of unnecessary repetition and unclarified information. And whatever happened to those puppets? He never tells. Very little text about how the specials were actually filmed in their ""Animagic"" technique. How were the puppets made? By whom? What size were they? How were they worked? Lots and lots of questions left in readers' minds. Poor job. But--we're stuck with it. The attempt is nice, but it needs lots of work."
2,adequate stand,"This stand is strong and lightweight. It gets two stars because it arrived in poor condition, several bolts were loose, some had to be retrieved from the box and reattached (we had to figure out where and how they went), it was obvious that these were not meant for the customer to attach. A rubber protector piece was lodged inside the center column of the stand when it should have been attached on the end, we had to force it out and reattach it. We have a Pyle-Pro PA yet the unit fits so snugly it takes a lot of effort to remove the PA from the stand."
3,Mixed results,I didn't find it to be very effective when it comes to support but it's very comfortable.
2,Eh...,"Looks as if it would stay in place a little more than it does. I'm not too big of a girl so I figured the XXL would be decently large on me, however that is not the case. It seems as if it is a medium, and constantly rolls up."
2,Shapewear,this tank shapewear is not comfortable. It seems like it pushes everything and makes it flat and not attractive at all......
2,Wrong product shipped to me.,"I'm sure that this product does what it says it does, but I can't tell you for sure, because it never reached me. I ordered the delicate gem and pearl cleaner for my engagement ring, which has pearls in the setting. What I received was the standard formula which clearly states that it is not safe to use on pearls. I've never had this problem with Amazon before, but needless to say I'm very disappointed."
2,No included Brush???,"While clearly brand new and sealed, the product DID NOT come with a jewelry brush as the description indicated. Neither was one mentioned on the outside of the product itself. Now I'm trying to find a seperate jewelry brush to use with the product as I don't have one kicking around already...what a pain."
2,Leaky bottle,"We have tried many different water bottles for our parrot who loves drinking this way. So far, the LIXIT is the best, although that is a relative term. The others had major malfunctions, while the LIXIT had only one problem for us. The ball bearing in the tube where the water comes out kept getting stuck. very frustrating for our bird, and ourselves. Now.. that being said, it didn't flood the bird cage with dripping or gushing water, like other brands, it is easy to attach and remove from the cage, and also easy to clean. If you can keep it from hanging up inside the feeding tube.. it might be worth having. Maybe ours was a one time defect.. don't know. But that is our experience."
2,Wondering when we would get to the explanation,"I was extremely excited to start this book. I am extremely glad that I am done with it. I still don't really know what the point of the story was or really what I read. I had to go over some chapters again just to figure out what character the author was referring to. I think that other reveiws were correct in saying that it is hard to know which character was which in the high school segments because there was no reference by name. I think that the concept of the book was interesting, however, follow through just wasn't there."
3,.....interesting concept,"The beginning of this book really captured my interest, but I lost some of my initial motivation to read it after moving a couple of times back and forth between the two teenage girls and the adult life of Diana McFee. The story became confusing and more than a little dull. Maybe Diana's adult life was supposed to be dull? The Kindle translation of the book was riddled with typographical errors. The word ""the"" was written so many times as ""die"" that I almost thought it was on purpose. Aren't these books proofread? How embarrassing!"
2,Good set up founders,"As practically every review points out, the first 6 pages are riveting and create an interesting premise. The last 19 pages are also interesting. The 200+ pages that come between are numbingly bland and soporiphic. After the opening, it quickly becomes obvious (as the title telegraphs) that the bulk of the book is the flash forward of a teen imagining her life. And that's the problem -- full of teen naivte, it's a future with all the depth and resonance of a Hallmark card. Lilacs and peonies bloom with cloying sweetness. Picket fences and husbands are both ""perfect"" -- and all but indistinguishable from each other. The garden isn't just a garden but ""her very own little garden."" The house is ""her very own dream house."" I heart life, jotted with endless repetition. By failing to create a rich or textured future for her character, the author made it impossible for me to care much about her or feel the enormity of her loss."
1,Church Classics not as expected,"I ordered Church Classics because it was listed with Steven Anderson on my search for piano music played by him. It is not what I expected. It is the music performed by Festival Choir and Hosanna Chorus. No where on the CD's do I find anything by Steven Anderson. What a disappointment. Since I have already opened it expecting piano music, I can't return it. After the fact I read the other review on this and I wish I had read it before I ordered. I am VERY disappointed."
4,This cd is awesome except for 1 or 2 songs.,"If you like east coast rap you'll like this cd. With her hit song gotta man, she makes top dog on my ranks."
3,very nice,I remember enjoying this album sometime around early 2000 and loving the song love is blind. But sadly people only give her credit for her gwen stefani association and she is so much more than that.
3,3.5 stars,"Eve's flow on here is very good and her rhymes are not to be reckoned with. Swizz Beat's production here is excellent, although a litte outdated. But let's keep in mind that this album is almost seven years old.Some of the songs lack good hooks, and one or two of them just don't have any. The guest appearances are not all that good and they take time away from Eve's hungry, fierce rhymes. Eve is best when she is speaking from the heart, like on ""Heaven Only Knows"" and ""Love Is Blind."" She is able to talk about her emotions and her struggle without hurting her image.There are some flaws on this album, but overall it is pretty good. You can definitely bump this one in your car. The fact that this is from 1999 and it is still listenable is admireable and cannot be said for a lot of hip hop releases. I would recommend buying this, but maybe buy it used."
4,she is terrific,Eve is one of the best.My favorite is gotta man . She is the queen. I love her lyrics
5,a great cd,"this is a great debut album. Chokie Nikes is the funniest interlude i think i've ever heard. the best songs are ""gotta man"" ""scenario 2000"" ""lets talk about"" and ""aint got no dough"""
4,HOT,EVE IS HOT RIGHT NOW. BUT I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE FROM HER. DON'T GET ME WRONG IT PHAT BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE BLAZIN. NO IM NOT HATIN THE FIRST LADY OF RUFF RYDERS BUT LISTENING TO HER ON THE RUFF RYDRES ALBUM I EXPECTED MORE. PEACE!!!
2,"EVE IS HOT,BUT...","EVE IS PRETTY GOOD WITH HER LYRICS.STYLE IS A B PLUS.BEAT WISE, SWIZZ BEATS NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THE LAB.TAKE NOTES, ON HOW OTHER PRODUCERS LIKE PRIMO,DR. DRE,ERICK SERMON LAST OVER A DECADE.EVE ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN TAKE ON ANY FEMALE AND A FEW MALE MCS OUT THERE.EVE IS HOT.I JUST DON'T LIKE THE ALBUM OVER ALL.BUT IF ARE THE TO BUY A WHOLE ALBUM FOR ONE OR TWO SONGS,THEN BE MY GUESS."
5,gotta-have CD,"This is my second time purchasing this CD. My last one got jammed in a CD player and we couldn't get it out. I immediately had to get another one!! There are only a few songs on this, but they are all amazing!! A must-have for any Jack Johnson fan!!!"
2,Jack's Worst,"Being a fan of Jack Johnson, I thought this one would be as good as the others. I wasn't impressed at all. It sounds like a few guys pickin' around in the basement. The recording quality has very little production value. At best, these are okay live versions of usually great songs. This is an unnecessary piece for your Jack Johnson collection."
5,Awesome music,"This CD is a great mix of music. Although a little short, the songs are great to jam to while riding in the car. I especially love the last track-the hidden one is so funny! Gotta check it out!"
3,Good not great,"If you are planning on buying this and printing it off with trails pre-loaded, think again. This is strictly a topo map. Roads are indicated but trails are not. I have found this software helpful in teaching boy scouts how to orient themselves on a map with a compass. Unless you are doing mostly cross country hiking or plotting your own trails, then you are better off just buying the individual map you need at REI or your local outfitter."
1,buyer beware,"Be informed that the claim to be compatible with Garmin is bogus. Although it can read the signal from Garmin, it will not upload the maps. Makes it pretty worthless as a GPS addon."
2,More bugs than Windows Vista,"The maps themselves are great, the software is garbage. Can't export large files, can't print to larger than on sheet of paper, without you having to piece it all back together like a jigsaw puzzle. Tech support is absolutely TERRIBLE. You have to email a question, then a day later you get an answer that is WRONG, if they bother to reply. They will NOT answer you by phone. Their suggestions for fixes on their website don't work. If you report a bug, they want you to tell them how to fix it. Amazon doesn't show the Alaska topo map, but that is the program I have, not California."
1,National Geographic TOPO Maps,"This product is very hard to use, especially if you are trying to download it to a Magellan Triton 500. Not user friendly or intuitive at all."
3,Amazon Price is Weird?,this product (CA version) is listed for $149 at Amazon and at $99 at the National Geographic website and at REI. What's up with that? 50% over the MSRP?
4,Old Idea... new to me!,"I found this book to be a delightfully inspirational blend of stories, facts and a common sense approach to the home garden environment, although, I would not use this book as a definitive ""how to guide"".I think this books main value is in its provocative manner. I read it, and two weeks later have started a plethora of mini permaculture experiments. I searched around my home to find my ""micro-environments"" and have started to identify my ""weeds"" to see what they can tell me about my soil conditions. I even found a ""weed"" growing plentifully in my backyard, was actually an herb!I recommend this book especially for those new or just beginning to explore the wide world of the home garden."
3,"A good book, but it may be time for a new edition.","I've been organic gardening for several years and I find this book contains very useful information for the gardener who wants to work with Mother Nature instead of against her. As described by the author (and others elsewhere), permaculture uses organic gardening principles to deal with big as well as little problems.Most of his ideas are worth trying. His concept ""live and let-live"" may work in some areas, but not in others. I can tolerate some wildness in my gardens but want to keep natural vegetation out of some parts of my yard. Overall, there are many wonderful ideas, but not all of them may work for you."
1,Cuisinart 4-Piece Stainless-Steel Kitchen Tool Set,"Very disappointed in this product. Such a shame for the Cuisinart name to have such defects in their product.My order arrived with deep manufacturing defects on the non-slotted spoon handle, quite an eyesore, as I am very picky how my kitchenware looks. Amazon immediately sent a replacement. The replacement set also had a defect in the non-slotted spoon. Again, I was very, very disappointed. I returned both sets for full credit.The weight of the set was nice. The set at first glance was very pleasing, but once I saw the spoon I was a very unhappy camper for the price I paid for this kitchen tool set. I will not buy another set."
1,Buttons stop working after a few months of normal use.,This phone is a nice phone to start with but only after a few months of use the buttons stoped working. I can't return it its to late so know I have a useless phone. Thanks Uniden!
3,Why is this not in 16 x 9???,"I have nothing negative to say about the content. The presentation could be better.1) It's in 4 x 3 aspect ratio. No excuse for that.2) Each quarter is a chapter. That's it. It would have been logical to place chapter markings at every commercial break, or even arbitrarily... every few minutes.With all the resources available to NFL films, these two minor gripes should not have even been a second thought.A nice addition, though perhaps unreasonable to expect, would have been to include some added footage of the players and coaches mic'ed up on the sidelines. Inside the NFL did this for their Super Bowl 44 special, and it adds a great touch to the game."
4,A great DVD of there best games!,"Lets start with Miami, where the saints after starting 5-0. The Saints started off down by 21 points. Drew and company led a comeback to beat them 46-34 and keep there undefeated season alive. Next was the Falcons, where the saints defense had a big day with three interceptions and led them to a 35-27 Victory. Then finally there huge game against the Patriots, where there defense and offense took down Brady and the Patriots 38-17. All of these games were great. But I would have taken out the Falcons game and put in the game against the Redskins, where they had a lot of big plays and came back to win in overtime. But I think they wanted to include a Falcons game since they are rivals. But all in all this was a great DVD showcasing some of the best games for the saints of the year and of all time."
1,Not Impressed,"Please don't waste your money! It arrived in a timely manner, but was in horrible condition. The middle was bent. The left hook was also bent and wouldn't fit properly over the door. And all the pegs had black markings on them. Frankly, it appears as if this item was used by someone else."
1,No jump harness,"The directions for fitting harness to my dog was not easy to use or follow. I had tried for over 4 weeks to assemble the harness, but had to return because I couldn't get it to work. I contacted shopeze to ask for better instructions, but they didn't have any."
3,not worth the money,"Curb your enthusiasm is a great show, but the second season is by far the worst batch of episodes. Unlike seasons 3 and 4, season 2 doesn't have an interesting story. I loved season 1, but I just wasn't feeling these episodes. However, the worst thing about it is the price. $35.00 for 10 episodes, no extra features - not even any commentary! At least the first season came with the hour long special plus some commentary. If you are a fan of Curb and you want to see these episodes - buy it off of Ebay, don't waste your money"
1,...,"expecting a typical tourist-type video, i am appalled at what iperceive as a video of covert anti-semitism. there arenumerous...comments from the narrator.as an example, i paraphrase,"" the people of tel-aviv are not shackled by the stuffiness of the old-testament.""... the term ""old-testament"" is one that ... find offensive. it can be called the jewish bible or the hebrew anaachronym, tanach, but not the old-testament.consequently, i strongly do not recommend this video to anyone who is jewish"
2,Not for large tires,I purchased this rack for my '08 Jeep Rubicon but learned too late that this rack is only for small spare tires. The size of my spare tire prevents the arms of the rack from opening fully so I can not properly lock them open.Make sure your tire is small enough to mount this rack to.
2,too restrictive,"the rack came very promptly, however, the packaging was badly beaten up, and the actual rack had scratches when i took it out of the box. it was easy to install on my '05 jeep liberty, and is sturdy. there is one big problem i have with it- it doesn't fit anything smaller than a 16"" mens bike. i have a small mens bike- 14"", and i had to purchase a bar adapter so it would fit, and even then it's still a very tight fit! it's a great rack, but too restrictive on the size bikes it holds!"
5,Works great with my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara,"I just returned from a weekend camping trip, my first using this product, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. It was simple to install. I was concerned that my spare tire (the standard tire from Jeep) might be too big, but it fits wonderfully. I was able to take my men's mountain bike and my girlfriend's women's mountain bike down the freeways and back-roads of Southern California without any issues from the rack. Getting the bikes mounted is pretty easy. It was a little different with my girlfriends bike since the bike has different bar angles, but I was able to make it work. I used my bike lock as an additional tie-down just in case, but it wasn't necessary. This morning I took the bikes off and the system easily collapses flat against the tire. You could even take the whole thing off between trips if you don't like the look of the rack. Its so easy to put back on! I shopped around and found Amazon was a bit cheaper than most."
2,"Sorry, but I didn't love it.","I think the biggest problem for me was Bitsy, I found her extremely irritating and dull. Most people in the book were so taken with her, but there was no justification for the constant adoration showered upon her. This book was also too darn long! I just wanted it to end already! Dorothy was funny, but the letters really got to be a bit much. I wouldn't say not to read it because it seems that all the other reviewers loved it. BUT, I wouldn't have too high of expectations and just check it out at the library--no need to buy this one."
1,ProSoft Data Rescure II (Mac),The product did not recover the data on my drive. It spent over 24 hours scanning the drive and then the data it recovered was unusable. I would not buy this product again.
1,Use Time machine.,Another computer ravaging piece of crapware from prosoft. Like Drive idiot 1 & 2 this product does not work and is totally unessessary. Time Machine with Leopard is awesome and it works. Don't trust prosoft they don't support their products and charge for updates on 2 months after purchase that do nothing for software that does less than nothing.
4,"Interesting twist on clash of cultures, past and present","Travis Fox and other modern day Apaches are transported for colonization to Topaz. They are unwillingly subjected to Redax, a procedure which occurs during stasis. They are mind-linked with their ancient ancestors during transport, and upon arrival are expected to use that knowledge to help survive the early colonization. Upon arrival they crash and encounter modern day Russians, who have also been exposed to their Mongol ancestors' ways. The Russian government is able to control the Mongols' behavior remotely from a ship located on the surface. The Apaches and Mongols must unite and work together to free the colony from the Russian government. There is a nice blend of themes here, with Fox using science and tradition to help him with the problem of modern day oppression. Another winner from Norton."
2,Why is everyone so obsessed?,"Why is this game such a big deal? It gets good ratings and acclaim from the critics. I read your reviews and others and decided to rent it. My first and only reaction was how pathetically easy it was. The moves were easy to pull off, and when i began, i mainly used them. Then as the game progressed and i found that the opponents were actually good at blocking them, i began to devolve my strategy into first combos then just mindnumbing pushing of three buttons in order. Punch-Punch-Punch. All you had to do was evade an opponent attack and then just do that combo. Evading is remarkably easy as all the characters have a remarkably long wind up, but if you fail, you are caught in a looong combo that you have absolutely no chance to get out of. The computer took half my ""life"" away with one combo followed by hits when i was down, because I COULD NOT GET UP. The controls are sluggish and the graphics bit the big one. Can someone please explain why it is so good?"
5,VF3 for Dreamcast,"Okay, i'm sick of seeing people rate this game 2 stars. This game is awesome, and I'm sticking to it. I've played Soul Caliber, and I have to admit that it's pretty good too, but VF3 graphics much better, despite being 3 years older, and most importantly the gameplay is best for a 3d fighter yet. Although Soul Caliber does have the added rpg feature I don't see how it adds anything significant to the game. Fighters are meant to be played with friends. There's no fun in beating up on the computer. Bottom line, if you're looking for a great game that'll keep you busy for months then you've found it. This one's a definite keeper. To all of you that are bashing this game for the sake of attacking Sega, all I can say is don't kill yourself over the fact that they're putting out quality titles. And you brats, if your mommy was kind enough to get you a Dreamcast stop complaning that u want a PSX2. I know she's sick of you, grow up."
3,Good game unfortunately.,Virtua Fighter set the standard for 3D fighters for quite a while. Unfortunately Soul Caliber leaves it in the dust. The Character rendering seems almost childlike in comparison.
2,get soul calibur,"i took it home and played and i was very disapointed the sega saturns version was better than this. the graphics stink and they all have the same moves and the best move of the gave is punch three times in a row. i went to a friends house the day after i got and i played soul calibur and it is about 1,000 times better...trust me get soul calibur if you want 3d fighting."
5,"Deep gameplay, not for the novice button masher","Try to get past the fact that the graphics aren't flashy. The backgrounds still beat Soul Calibur's. And remeber that these graphics are TWO YEARS OLD! As for extras, there is a versus mode in the U.S. version. The deep gameplay will keep you coming back. No one plays this game well by bashing random buttons. Any gamer that has played this game for months (like myself) will tell you that mastering a character is perhaps the most rewarding art form on the planet. It should be a sport in the olympics because the balanced gameplay is so original and fair. The people who invest time in learning how to play will be rewarded. The morons who try to beat their friends by not knowing the moves will be humiliated."
4,An excellent and very deep fighting game!,"Despite the fact Soul Calibur is a much more beautiful game (and the arriving Dead Or Alive 2 is just as beautiful), Virtua Fighter 3tb is still worth its weight in gold thanks to its fantastic gameplay and lush locales. There's plenty of learn here, including counters, throws, and power moves. For a three year old game, VF3tb still has talent to burn."
1,"Don't buy, Software is garbage","This reminds me of the days of Windows '95 when about 1 in 4 products took hours, sometimes days to work right. Mine came with QuickStart 8 and I never got it up and running, even after downloading patches, re-installing, ect..... Total garbage."
5,pretty darn cool,"I dont like platform games.I thought id absolutely hate this ... game...but its really cool.The frame rate is absolutel amazing with NO NOT A BIT of pop up.The graphics are incredible as well.Sonic and his fully 3d environments look great.This game is really cool and is probably like nothing youve played.Sonic does huuuuuuuge cool jumps and runs real fast, and the frame rate and grphics keep up with him.The sound is also really good, the effects and music fit this game perfectly."
3,"Educational value 5*? Yeah, right...","I don't get it. This is a nice enough game, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen before (and with slicker graphics) from the likes of Crash Bandicoot.The controls seem only loosely connected to the character, and the camera has the familiar angle and visibility problems that plague so many 3D games. The game world is huge, but it's also very sparse, and I suspect most people will bore of it quickly.If Sega want to get people to buy Dreamcast, they need to do a lot better than this."
2,I would've expected better from a new system with 128-bits.,"This game rocks but some of the character sequels are different when you beat a playable character. Yet the graphics are pretty good except sometimes they are unrealistic (like when Dr. Robotnik grabs a Choas Emerald). Also the hand detail on the characters is bad because the separation of the fingers on the hand is just a line for every finger, I would've expected better from a new system. There are also things you have to figure out by yourself, and some of the clues are very difficult to understand. So please next time they make a Sonic game with good graphics buy it, but don't buy this one."
2,Worst game out for Sega Dreamcast!,"This game is not good at all. It is not fun to play and it just gets you dizzy. I would not recommand it, unless you are 10 years old and under. Do not buy it!"
5,Awesome,"Sonic Adventure is certaintly one of the best games on DC. the graphics are incredible, six playable characters, the Chao mini game, lighting fast play control. It also has a nice storyline and is a must buy for the DC owner."
3,"Great fun, bad control and camera glitches.","I have the japanese version and have played the english rental version. It is a very short game and easy too. It's fun, but you will be frustrated with the glitchy camera angles and controls that plague the gameplay. Also, the game seems on rails most of the time, like everything is done for you. Other than that, a good game. Maybe worth the admission just for the graphics."
4,overall good game,"It's a good game, my favorite in the series. But my eyes got really tired of trying to follow a little ball around the screen and the camera angles are a little tricky. One thing that stands out is that there is excellent graphics. They are really great."
5,The Fastest Game on Earth!,This game is AWESOME. The levels are designed very well. The Game is very fast but there is no slowdown in the game. You can be 6 characters and if you beat the game you can play as Super Sonic! Here is my detailed evaluation.Graphics: 5 Stars- Excellent graphics. The characters look real!Music: 4 Stars- Sound is well done overall but a little too repetitive.Controls: 5 Stars- Easy to control and you can control the camera.Camera: 3 Stars- Bad in parts but since you can control the camera it makes it a little better.Gameplay: 5 Stars- A very fun but hard game. You might want to pick up a Player's Guide.
4,Nice AAA-battery player,"All in all this is a pretty decent mp3 player that uses a AAA battery. You can add up to a 2GB SD card, but that's it. It will not support any SD HC cards. So you're max'd out at 4GB. (or at least until RCA updates the firmware to support it)"
4,"nice, solid MP3 player","I like the fact that this ues AAA batteries. I can listen for hours without worrying about battery life. One AAA lasts for plenty of time. No playlist to modify, but maybe that helps the price. Folders sort of allow you to separate music."
5,Awesome!,This Starter Gift Box is Awesome! It has really cool pokemon like a first edition Machamp and you'll either get the theme deck Water Blast or Power Reserve. You'll also get a booster pack with 11 tradable cards in it. I bought this for my self and I can't stop playing with it. I bring it to shool and show my friend. It's so awesome! If you have kids at least 14 or under you should get this for them. It's a great way to start off.
4,Good Family Game,"I think parents will enjoy the cards and the responsibility it brings their child.I use them as a tool for good grades. For every 4 A's they get to pick 2 cards out of a fresh deck of cards. It has improved their grades in school.It also brings our family together, We have family night we play pokemon and also trade with each other."
2,A Smokers' Book,"Received book today. I believe the seller should have listed that it was a smokers book. It smells from cigarette every badly even after spraying with Fabreeze. I am airing it out. Hoping the smell disappears. I knew it was a used book. However, I expected it to be clean."
4,TOTAL BODY WORKOUT,"This is a very comprehensive 60 minute workout that covers everything: A warm up, a low-impact aerobic workout and then a total body shaping workout that includes floor work and stand up exercise with weights. And as usual, Joanie makes it fun, while educating you on technique and giving you a really great workout. The 2010 DVD version is the same exact workout as the original VHS version of Joanie Greggains' One on One Workout."
1,"Broke.; received new model; squeaked, replaced",My mom and step-dad bought this glider for me Dec. 2004. After a month or two is started to squeak. The back eventually broke. I emailed the manufacturer and sent pictures. They replaced the glider with the new model. After a month this new model started to squeak. It got worse as the days went on. I emailed the manufacturer again and sent in a video. They sent me a new base. There is some squeaking but not like it was. I think I can deal with it until it gets worse. The manufacturer was very helpful and I was glad they replaced the old model and the base of the new model.
2,Not broken but squeaks a lot,"When I bought this I thought I found a great deal. I remember being blown away by how expensive other gliders were. I tried the floor model at the local babies r us store and I thought the cushion was thin but the glider itself was good. I found it online at half the price in the store and figured I could add a cushion to make it more comfortable.The chair was great for about the first week. Then it started to squeak. No matter how I positioned myself, it creaked and squeaked. Then it started to jolt just a little as we rocked over the centerpoint. Amazingly, my daughter didn't seem to mind. We're going on two years and it's held out ok, but we never could make the squeaking go away. Now we just use it to read books in."
1,Dangerous Chair,I was not aware until I got ready to write this review that other people have had a similar experience to mine. Within months of owning this glider the back broke where it connects to the seat! My mother-in-law was rocking my daughter to sleep - no warning or anything - it just snapped. Very disappointing considering the cost of the chair. I am going to contact the manufacturer to see if I can get a refund and buy a different chair.
1,First and last Cuisinart pan,"Have always used All-Clad pots and pans and a couple of cheap Farberwares. I got this thinking I'd try a mid-priced pan, it looked great and the weight was nice. Will never buy Cuisinart cookware again, with exactly ONE overheating it turned an ugly copper color on the entire exterior and I can't find any way to bring the silver color back. Have never had a pot do this before. Don't waste your money."
5,1.5 oz sauce pan,"Product came on time, exactly as described. Have used it many times, no problems at all. Overall great transaction. Thanks."
5,It's a pot,"It's stainless steal, it holds about two quarts. I put some water in it, placed it on the stove and boiled eggs in it. It worked, you'll be amazed."
1,Product Gets Rust Stains,"We are disappointed in this product. We purchased a set of these. We have only had the pots for a few months and two of them, the 3 quart one, and the larger 8 quart one, both have gotten MULTIPLE SMALL CIRCULAR RUST STAINS all over the bottom (inside where the food is cooked). I have tried to scrub these rust stains off, and they don't respond to cleaning."
3,Works just fine but a little dangerous,"I'm not sure if it's a defect but as the boiling water touches the upper part of the saucepan when pouring out, it sizzles and creates slight splashes. This does not happen to our other cuisinart saucepans. This is the first time I've seen this so we always have to be extra careful when pouring out liquids from this saucepan. Handle does get hot as with other pans."
3,Okay,"I have the Cuisinart Chef's Classic stainless 1 1/2 qt sauce pan and like it so much that I ordered the 3 qt pan. I'm not as happy with the 3 qt pan. The handle on it is much thinner than the 1 1/2 qt and is not as comfortable in the hand. The lip is great for no-drip pouring on both pans and everything else that is promoted about the pan is fine. But for me, the quality and comfort of the handle is a big factor in overall satisfaction of use."
4,"Doh, just too easy to burn","I burned 10 saucepans before this one, in 3 years, as a cook-once-a-while sort of 'chef'. I thought it might take me at least a month to burn this one but I was wrong. It took me 2 weeks to receive the order from amazon but only one week to burn it.Hey, but other than that, a quality one!"
2,Good while it lasted...,"...but like so many others here, ours broke after 16 months of use. The other descriptions are accurate - the screws won't hold the back on any more and can't be fixed (wood splits and anchors will no longer hold the screws.) I was planning to use this chair for multiple children given the price, but now I'm stuck - pregnant again and looking for another glider. I give it the two stars because it was a good chair for the time that it lasted - we did get some use out of it, although not our money's worth."
4,Rainy day music,"This isn't the flashy upbeat Peanuts music that most people think of when they think of Vince Guaraldi. Rather, this is very mellow, and at times melancholy, music. It is perfect to pop in your car's CD player on a rainy day, or any other time when you want to escape the hassles of the world."
1,Just to make money,Smith has no direct evidence for his claim and has no formal theological training with which to evaluate Warren's theology. It seems his real issue is with Schuller but he rides the coattails of the Purpose Driven name to sell books. His essential claim is guilt by very loose association.
3,"Great Performance, but a lot of other factors.","First, as others have said, the performance is not lacking in any way. Great set list, band is on spot, band and crowd energy is through the roof. My issues are with the DVD itself.My case arrived with a broken hinge - not the end of the world, but frustrating. The video editing isn't the best either. There are very few good shots of the rest of the band, and when there are, they last for no more than a second or 2 (no exaggeration)!And now the real issue - the region code. The Amazon listing labels the region as ""All"", and the back of the case even says 100% playability. This is not true - this disc does not play in American DVD players. Fortunately, I was able to change some settings to get one of my computer's media players to play the disc. If it wasn't for that, I'd be making a return."
4,DVD as promised in description,"i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my box came with a big slash on the side of it, a pen knife slash. cut through the plastic and the paper insert. but dvd works fine"
5,pizza! pizza!,"how can you Not love TMNT??? Raph was always my favorite, his mean spirit but loyalty always got me swooning (yes I'm aware they are just turtles) but you gotta love the diversity in these guys from a southern cali surfer (Mikey) to the rough guy from the Bronx (Raph) it all comes back to friendship and loyalty to those you love and care about, I mean with a guy like Casey Jones you really can't go wrong!Cowabunga Dudes and Dudettes!"
4,TMNT Collection Review,"I think almost everyone loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The TMNT are cool and funny. Now people get to own the TMNT movies on Blu-ray in one set. These movies do look and sound better than the DVD versions. One thing is in the first movie I still saw some grainy textures in some scenes. Which is kind of disapointing because I expected more out of a HD transfer. I also noticed that some of the colors in scenes were changed a little too. In the first movie where the sewer scenes are shown the surrounding is supposed to be more orangish, on the BD one it looks kind of like a regular place. I don't know if they changed it because they didn't like it or maybe that's how the movie supposed to look like. Too bad there isn't any special features for the first 3 films. If there was this collection would be much better. People also get a comic book, sketch, and character cards too. If you loved all the TMNT movies then you have to buy this collection. Cowabunga dudes!"
4,"Great Movies, Good Extras, So-So Packaging","If you want to save yourself the hassle of buying all four Ninja Turtle movies and a Ninja Turtle hat separately, then this set is for you! I love the hat, and the other items are okay. The movies look really good, especially the CGI TMNT on blu-ray. There is a much cheaper set that includes just the original three movies, but this one has the CGI one too which is preferable to me. One thing I would warn is that while the pizza box concept is neat, it takes up way too much space on your shelf and is pretty fragile. I really like the hat though!!"
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I figured my skin would be less irritated if I stopped using so much benzoyl peroxide for a while and switch to something more ""natural"" for my blemishes. I picked this up on a whim, and had high hopes for it.I must say I was very disappointed. I used it for several weeks. It would burn and sting on my face. I thought it would just be a side-effect that would eventually subside, but I just couldn't take it anymore. It had no affect on my pimples at all. The smell of it isn't so pleasant either.I guess it's back to a benzoyl peroxide treatment for me."
4,Practicing reconciliation,"This is an eloquent and evocative book, written from the perspective of an African American who is the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs at Virginia Theological Seminary and who in the past worked with Desmond Tutu in South Africa. I was perhaps lest interested in the typology of reconciliation, and more interested in the author's personal history and his meaningful concept of ""inhabiting reconciliation."" Practicing reconciliation in a violent world invites hope when the news on TV is too often an invitation to despair."
4,A Baby of Her Own,As always Brenda Novak gave her fans a good read with characters whose past makes their actions believable. I'll likely read it again.
2,janice,"It was a little ridiculous. I'm sorry I wasted the time reading it. But, it was a beautiful day to read on the deck."
5,"WONDERFUL SINGER, SHE WILL NEVER BE FOREGOTTEN","when i was at my grandma's house she had an old 45 recorddominique song , i fell in love with song for years, but never who sang the song,years had past, but computers came out and the internet, my brother showed me you tube,now i knew how had made this song, so went to amazon .com they had the cd , so i had to have it .thank god for amazon .com your the best.also i would like to say this, thank god for JEANINE DECKERS her songs will live on, she is a wonderful singer ,god bless JEANINE DECKERS."
3,A fair phone for a while,"I have had this phone for a few years and had to send the handset in for repair to the headset jack. After another 3 years, it needs to be repaired again. The cost to repair and ship it twice is about what it would cost for a new phone. So, I guess I got my money's worth, if I don't get it repaired. Time to look for a better phone system...."
1,I Hate this phone,"Contrary to the other review, I HATE THIS PHONE. The clarity is terrible. Also, the two line feature on the handset is confusing. The line functions are difficult to use. Giving Uniden the benefit of the doubt, and considering the other review, perhaps I just got a bad phone. However, this is the second time that I have been disappointed with Uniden products. If you try this phone, save all the packing material so you can return it. I didn't and now I'm afraid that I'm stuck with this hunk-of-junk. The price was great for a phone with so many features. But then...you get what you pay for. Frankly, I'd get a Sony. That's what I intend to do if I can return this one. Beware."
1,Bad design.,The rivets are a big problem on this pot. I regularly use a steamer basket in these big pots and the rivets prevent me from easily lifting out the steamer basket. I really hate using this pot because of this and it makes it completely unusable for much of what I do in the kitchen. I have an older Cuisinart pot that does not have rivets and the handles have not fallen off in twenty years. I don't see why the rivets are an improvement.
2,"Stain on you, Cuisinart","Pots shouldn't stain after first use. Period. This one does. For this price and purported quality, that's unacceptable. Enough said."
4,Too much of a good thing,"Training Plans is a very thorough book and will be relied upon heavily in training for my first Ironman. But because I purchased the book for one specific event, 70% of the book is extranious information. That's my fault for being so one dimensional however. A bigger gripe is the actual plans. I've downloaded several training plans for marathons and am used to glancing at my calandar, seeing it's Tuesday, and thereby knowing that I need to run 5 miles at a stated pace. The training plans in this book require digging through the appendexis to decipher the abbreviations and to determine what the author had in mind for that day. A small price to pay no doubt but just looking at the plans in the present format gives me a headache."
5,Nice Addition for Home Exercising,This is a great way to exercise lateral and rearward leg motions. The illustrated pamphlet provides clear instructions. I use the entire pamphlet as an element of my routine.
2,Do not buy if using in your lap!,"This had great reviews but I'm so unhappy with this product. I purchased it for working on my laptop in my easy chair. Firstly the legs on the stand are metal and gouge into my legs when using it while sitting and the weight of the notebook rests on these. Why on earth wasn't the back left solid straight across? I have no use for the USB organizer. I'm sure it would work fairly well on a tabletop but not for what I wanted. The front raised areas intended to catch the notebook from sliding off aren't high enough to stop even a 15"" size as that has repeatedly happened. I have tried to add padding to make do but may just throw it in the garbage. Table maybe yes, but lap a definite NO!"
4,Much better than a similar product on here,"This is much better than the similar Safco product. That one only allowed steep angles, and it was not solidly constructed, so it would flex and a front corner would come up. Also this has a padded bottom, while the Safco just has metal bars which may scratch your table. There is no contest."
5,Perfect for MacBook Pro!,"This laptop stand is the perfect one for my laptop, a MacBook Pro! It is sturdy, and simply gets the job done!The very best choice for a college student!"
4,Rolodex Laptop Stand #82410,The Rolodex Laptop Stand #82410 turned out to just what I wanted. It is sturdy and is good looking. You can adjust it to several different angles which make it easer to type. Well worth the price.
3,Just a little short on the holders,"This is lightweight, adjustable, and attractive. But the prongs on the front that hold the laptop in place are NOT big enough (in height) for my laptop. My HP does not have a square but rather curved underside at the front, so it easily rides up over the prongs. I've had to insert a non-stick surface so that the laptop does not slide off and cannot use the more angled option (which is what I prefer) because the weight of my laptop still forces it to slide over the prongs that are supposed to hold it in place. *****BUT, If you have a newer thin laptop (mine is NOT), this holder would be ideal. Larger, 'thicker' laptops, a no go."
3,Defective,"I would have given this five stars if it hadn't been defective. The slots that the adjusting bar fit into were not properly aligned, so my computer lists to one side and doesn't sit flat against the mesh support. Also, when I type, my computer bounces up and down. In all other respects, though, it meets my needs perfectly by raising my MacBook Pro to eye level and allowing me to type comfortably on the keyboard. The other stands that I looked at would have required a separate wireless keyboard. I'm sending it back and getting a replacement, hoping that the new one will not be defective. One other warning: the hub does not come with the stand. It must be purchased separately."
5,"Finally, a solid stand!","After another overpriced plastic laptop computer stand busted on me, finding this solid metal one was happy news, especially at the low price. There is an error in the manufacturer's description, though; it must be from a different product for this doesn't have any drawers, etc., nor is there any listed on the box itself. And this would not be an easy stand to travel with but that wasn't what I was looking for. Oh, and when you turn over the use directions, the backside of the instructions tells you how to turn the instruction sheet into an origami bird. Honest! A great and solid stand."
2,Laptop does not fit on stand,"Even though it was advertised for Toshiba laptops, my Toshiba Satellite did not fit on the rack. Be sure tocheck the depth of your Laptop before purchasing.The stand was also delivered with missing parts. Not impressed from such a well known brand name."
2,"Solid, but no included USB hub as stated in the description","Solid stand, but was disappointed that the USB hub was not included. Will not purchase again because of this deception."
4,"Solid, attractive stand - minor adjustment makes perfect","My brother, wife, and I all spend our working days typing on laptops set upon desks, so I got all three of us this stand for Xmas 2012. From other reviews I thought it seemed the most well-made of the options out there, and that is indeed the case: it is solid, stable, and matches my chrome macbook nicely.The only drawback has been noted in other reviews as well - it doesn't at first seem to be able to elevate the laptop screen high enough to put you in the perfect ergonomic posture. Also, since the macbook screen doesn't open past 115 degrees or so, the screen ends up angled slightly downward - not the ideal viewing angle.Simple solution - raising the front of the stand about 2"" (I propped it up on a black laquered box I keep pens in, which already lives on my desk) perfects the screen height and viewing angle issues.Stand now makes me happy on a daily basis, and does the same for my bro and better half. Yippee."
2,Don't expect much,"The charger seems ok, but the carrying case doesn't fit and won't allow the phone to completely close. Shipping took forever. Wish I had read the reviews before ordering."
1,Made in China!,"Terrible combo value - the ""leather"" cell case is pretty much crafted with two left hands, so to speak - all crooked, such a tight fit that it almost broke the phone, and once it was on the phone wont shut properly (leaving the light on and the battery a-wasting)so its entirely useless.Hardly a value - when I have a(nother) minute I'll be writing Amazon officially to see what my options are."
2,2.5,"Not bad. A brief detective story set in the future about tracking down the leader of a man-hating group of women known as Mankill Inc.. The focus is on the investigator following leads so there's almost no sequences of Mankill Inc. in action. It has some slightly amusing moments, but it's nothing I'd recommend or read again."
1,I wish I had bought a Falcon Guide,"I do not like this book at all. Maybe it is because I am used to using Falcon Guides, but when I purchase a hiking or backpacking trail guide I expect good trail narratives, not a description of the author's hiking experience. I don't care what time they got into camp or what they had for dinner. In a backpacking book I expect some description of water availability from streams, lakes, etc. In this book the authors only describe whether or not public water is available at campsites. Since I have not found this book to be of much use in planning a backpacking trip to Wisconsin, I am now purchasing the Hiking Wisconsin Falcon Guide."
5,Women's healing,Learning how to heal Gods way. There really is no better way to heal the hurts of life. This book draws one closer to God and is a great Bible study as well.
3,INTERESTING SLASHER FLICK,RITES OF SPRING is one creepy little horror flick that is two movies in one. Part of the movie is a crime drama and the other a WICKER MAN type horror film with a great creature named Worm Face. At first watch I didn't really know what to think of the movie. It's very ambitious and keeps you guessing throughout. Which I found very satisfying for these type of films. I also enjoyed that the two stories were connected and that the Rachel character is responsible for this butterfly effect that she sets in motion. There are some holes in the script that left me puzzled. What happened to the little girl? What happened to the bodies? Does it really end like that? The movie looks very professional and is absolutely beautiful. RITES OF SPRING is a gem of a low budget horror movie but I just wish that the script would have taken a little more time to explain itself. Definitely worth a rental and far better then a lot of big budget horror movies out there.
1,"An awful, horrible mess of a first draft screenplay where a movie should be","Take 3 somewhat interesting plot ideas, 7 amateur actors, 15 horror cliches (the occult, creepy old man, torture, animal sacrifice, boobs, a good hearted bad guy, a double cross, a rusty weapon, chases on roads, through cornfields, and through the deep dark woods), and mash them all together without the aid of a script editor and you'll wind up with this mess.Oh, and somewhere, running through the night, is an 8 year old plot device that I guess we're just supposed to forget about. I'm sure she can fend for herself. (She'll have to becuase the storyline abandons her beyond all logic.)Don't waste your money on a rental. You've probably got a VHS copy of Ghost Dad lying around somewhere."
2,Not for Pomeranians!,I bought this doggie bed because it looked like it would be nice and comfy. Had to send it back because it is so overstuffed that my little Pomeranian just rolled right off of it!
4,Not as heavy as I had hoped,"I bought this based on the good reputation in general of Cuisinart and the good price.I was disappointed in the lack of heft in the pan. It is not up to the quality of therest of my cookware which is medium quality stuff. Given the price and the relative infrequencyof using that large of a pan, I suppose I will keep it. However, if given a do-over, I wouldn'tbuy it. Surely won't buy any more of this line.Fit and finish and all that are just fine, but I'm not impressed with the weight (which translates into even heating) of thepan. I'll do an update after a few weeks of using it."
2,Limited usefullness,"I purchased this about 2 years ago at an well known kitchen supply store in Napa, Ca. I trusted their recommendation and I really liked this piece (at less than half the price of the All Clad) until...I baked some Paella in the oven at 375. The handle came loose at the rivets and, with a lifetime warranty, I returned the piece to Cuisinart (owned by Conair)in New Jersey. You will pay to ship the piece to and from depending on where you live which can be $20-30 due to the weight and size.The note that came back with my new replacement said that ""We strongly recommend low to medium heat be used on all Cuisinart cookware.""I was very surprised that 375-400 was not low to medium. So...if you want a versatile piece look elsewhere...do not use this to bake"
4,Almost Perfect,"This pan is great for family size meals.The only thing it is missing is the non-stick coating. Since I use it to fry and brown, stuff sticks to the bottom. After a 15 minute soak, I can clean it back to its original status."
1,Sorry for the purchase,"First off, I really like the size and the weight is not as bad as I expected. After the first use I was very disapointed with the pan. I limited the temperature to med. at the high point and still found that the pan had food sticking to it and was a nightmare to clean. I may never use this thing again and will go back to the old stand by ""green"" ceramic coating."
4,Great pan,This pan is nice and wide and deep enough for things that are saucy. The only negative I would say is that I wish the lid was glass so I could see what's inside.
3,I'll Be Seeing You,It was very unfinished for me. The ending could've been more developed. However it had a good story line. It didn't wow me.
3,I'LL BE SEEING YOU,The storyline was okay. I liked Reba & Kyle but not Csrley so much. I can relate to how Carley feels about how people treat her because of her disability. I didn't like how Carley was dishonest to Kyle when he was being very honest to her.
4,A real Tearjerker,"The wonderful story of two who meet in a hospital. One's eyes are in bandages, so when asked to describe herself, the girl doesn't exactly tell the truth. A wonderful story of love, trust, and lies"
4,Carley and Kyle face many hardships on their freindship.,"Carley Mattea, a cancer survivor whose only hope of surviving was to have surgery which left her face discombobulated , was recently admitted to the hospital when she broke her leg. In the hospital she meets Kyle, who is blind from a chemistry project that blew up in his face. Kyle thinks Carley is a beautiful, young girl but what will happen if he gets his sight back? Together they face many perils concerning their friendship."
5,The 1st and favorite book I have read of Lurlene McDaniels!,"I loved this book! it was the fist of Lurlene's books and I couldn't put it down! Loved the ending, but can't tell it; got to read it for your self. It is one of the best love stories ever if not the very best. I have read so many books of Lurlene McDaniel since I read this book. All her books are so good though and my goal is to read all of her books because they are all so good! I gave this book a perfect 10 because it was a very touching story. END"
5,Powerhouse Indy Sleeper,"Picked this movie up at a rental place on a whim; the concept sounded intriguing-crazy, lone-wolf assassin finds his potential replacement in the form of a lower-tier mob enforcer, and puts him through hell to see if he is worthy. Knowing it was a low budget independent production and fearing the worst, I was extremely pleased at the overall look of the film: acting, production values, special effects, music were all topnotch. And the story was tight and tense from beginning to end. But the thing that really stood out for me was the hand-to-hand combat scenes: brutal, fast and vicious streetfighting like you'd see in real life, not like in the ""movies."" It made you hurt watching these guys beat the crap out of each other. I just placed an order w/ Amazon to purchase my own copy. Do yourselves a favor and check out this movie now! You will not be disappointed."
3,Nice set up for a movie ......,"This movie had potential, but didn't live up to it. The story dragged. The action was very good. If the movie had moved along at a better pace, it could have been a 5 star movie."
5,ESPECTACULAR,"Excelente juego de ollas, muy buenos acabados todas las ollas llevan la marca impresa, el precio es super bajo,la comida no se pega, faciles de lavar sobre todo duraderas, las recomiendo."
3,Not that great,we bought this a month ago and already i am seeing small black spots in it. May be the layer is going off??? i am washing manually and very rarely washing through dishwasher. think before buying this...
4,Cookware,The cookware is very good. I am pleased with the quality and weight of the product. The 10 piece set has a great selection of sizes and works very well.
1,Very dissappointed with this product...,"I recently purchased this produce and after one use it started to rust, I am very dissappointed as i thought that this type of thing wouldn't occur."
5,Love to Cook,"I love cooking with my new Cuisinart Cookware Set. I recently bought a new house and wanted better cookware than the cheap set I had. Now, I cook almost every night with at least one pot or pan from my Cuisinart set. I have always enjoyed cooking but I have never a nice cookware set and now that I do I enjoy cooking even more. The clean up is also very easy. I rinse the pots and pans and put them in the dishwasher. They come out shining every time!!"
1,A major letdown.,I own a very large frying pan from Cuisinart. I use it very often. I bought this set because it SAID it was the same series of pans.I cannot believe it. The smallest saute / frying pan scorched with its first use. The smallest saucepan stained with ITS first use.I returned these pans because they are vastly inferior to what I expected.I am so disappointed that I might not bother looking at more Cuisinart pans to fill my needs in the future.
2,Cuisinart Customer Service (????),"Do not expect to get any sympathy from Cuisinart Customer Service (????) if you have a defective pan, as we did. Their refusal to swap out a factory defective pan for a new one has caused us to NEVER purchase anything from Cuisinart again, and to let other, potential customers, know about their lack of support for us customers. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this product based on the Cuisinart name. Needless to say we are very disappointed. We looked at and handled the pota and pans in a store before purchasing. The appeared to be good quality mid-priced set. The first time we used the pots, boiling salted water for corn, the inside bottom of the pot became pitted, as if the finish was chipping off. The same thing happened the first time we boiled water for rice in a sauce pan. We intend to contact Cuisinart about this, but hold out little hope. The limited warranty seems to be truely limited, plus they want $7.00 for handling. May just pack it all up and return it to Amazon. Very disappointed with Cuisinart."
4,Great Set for the Money,"This set gets daily use in my home. I cook two meals a day most days, and sometimes three. I've had this set for two or three years now, and no complaints. Not too heavy, not too light, every pot has its own lid, and all of the pots work great in the oven. Clean up is not too bad, either. These work really well with a flat top range where a buckled or warped pan would be useless. They don't stay super shiny, but they are presentable even after years of daily wear. With free shipping, I thought this was a good deal. I am very satisfied with the set and would recommend it in particular for grads and newlyweds."
4,Great Deal,I am pleased with the quick delivery and so far after one month of use the set still looks like new. I found the same set at the local mall department store for about $30 more than amazon. It was great to know that my set was the same quality as those offered in a trendy department store.
5,Quality Cookware set!,"Quality Cookware set! Well designed, and light. Some stainless sets I looked at were too heavy to work with. Easy to clean up. I'm extremely happy with my Cuisinart cookware."
4,Long lasting quality cookware,"We recently overhauled all my old mismatched pots and pans, I was reluctant to do so, not because the pots and pans I had were so exceptional but because I'm sort of a 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' girl. However, the point was well made that with two budding chefs in the house I had better up the quality of my pots and pans. I wasn't willing to make an enormous investment, I wanted a quality product, fairly inexpensive in all the most common sizes I would need most. This Cuisnart Chef's Classic Stainless-Steel 10-piece cookware set, fit the bill. I really like the stock pot tremendously.These are extremely beautiful as well and I love that I can use them in the oven as well as on the stove top - this is extremely important for our kitchen needs. This is a basic set of common sizes, very durable, easy to clean, the lids fit wonderfully. And again it is extremely beautiful."
5,Great cookware,I really enjoy this cookware. It cooks as great as it looks. Also I love that I can wash in the dishwasher. Some other reviews noted that this causes water spots. This may be true but I've only noticed the spots inside the cookware so who cares. I absolutely love the set and I think it's a great value. Highly recommended.
3,Great Starter Stainless Set,I purchased this when I moved into my new house. They are a great starter set but they stained after the very first use. Even with some elbow grease and some steel wool I wasn't able to restore them to their initial luster. Planned on hanging them however the stains have prevented me from doing so.
4,Good not Great,"The pots/pans have been great, but I they stained after only a few uses. I know they can be cleaned to a shiny state again, but I prefer to just wash my pots/pans with soap and water and be done.But they distribute heat evenly and look nice."
4,Very Nice.,Good product. Very pretty and heats up fast on low heat setting. I hate that I can't put it in the dishwasher. It should really be washed by hand if you want it to continue to look nice. Everything else is great.
4,Cuisinart 77-10 Chef's Classic Stainless mostly pleased,"The cookware is beautiful and nicely weighted, not too heavy, not too light. The lids fit and seal well. I thoroughly read all care/cooking directions before using my cookware. The outsides of my pots are staying beautifully ""mirror"" shiny. The inside bottoms of my pots-after 1 use- seem to have little imperfections or flecks imbedded in the metal. I don't know how I can remove this, but it seems that they are truly inside the metal because when I run my finger over them, I feel nothing but smoothness. I have other stainless pots, Oneida and Revere Ware, but I've never seen this type of spotting in any of them after years of usage. ??? I really enjoy cooking with the Cuisinart, as it doesn't require as high a heat and it does seem to clean up and shine quite easily, apart from the aforementioned problem. Can't wait to get a pot hanger for them!"
4,A solid lasting set with fine performance,"This was my first purchase for pots and pans. After determining that it would be cost effective to buy a set and I'm also determined to start cooking more for myself, I choose this one after looking all over. I'm impressed after about 3 years of moderate to heavy use.Only one little problem with the rivets on the inner part of larger pan is becoming dislodged and food can be a little difficult to remove, but even this has not effected the performance of this pan.It is fair to give this cooking set a solid 4.5 stars for price, lasting durability and a good performance.One more note that it scores well with me on even heat distribution. If they are a little difficult to clean I use a little dishwasher detergent and hot water."
3,Could be better,"Most of this set is good quality. Overall, I love the size of the pans, especially the saute pan. The handles do not get hot when heated which is a plus. The only problem I have is that the first time that I used the two skillet pans they became discolored. Even with a good cleaning, the pans have a brownish tint that will not go away."
2,Pots,This was a very disappointing purchase. One of the pots was stained when I got it and what do you know the warranty does not cover stains!
3,decent cookware,"Ups:-They are decent pans, looks great when you first take them out.-They are sturdy and I use metal utensils to cook, I like that.-The attached aluminum plate in the bottom helps spread and retain heat, if your stove isn't that powerful.Downs:-I like to sear and stir fry a lot with hot pans, so they will discolor a little with heat. Overheated oil will cause black oil spots on the pan that are hard to remove.-You need the pan to be hot so that it doesn't stick, and you will need to use a little more oil than typical. If you don't do either of these, your non-greasy food WILL stick to the pan.-The aluminum plate takes some time to heat up.-The aluminum plate reduces the responsiveness of ""lowering the flames"" on your stove. Less control.What this set needs:Large PanNon-stick omlette panWok"
5,"Good quality, great buy!",For the price this set deserves the 5 stars I have given it. I've been using it for about a month now and really like it. What led me to search for stainless cookware was my research on the potential health risks of teflon or non-stick cookware. I find myself wanting to cook more since the cookware is so nice to use. The only short-coming I can see with this set is that it does not have a large skillet but this could be purchased in addition to the set and you would still have gotten a super deal! I happened to have a 14 inch stainless steel skillet already. If you are looking for an econmical way to switch to stainless steal I highly recommend this set!
3,Warranty - must pay shipping both ways,"I like the product. It is lightweight and cooks quickly,however, one pot came with a flaw in the bottom of the pot. I was disappointed that I had to pay to ship it back for the warranty and then $7 for the company to ship it back to me. The warranty should cover shipping at least one direction."
5,Grrreeeeaaaattttt!!!!,Very sturdy and heats up quickly. It is a bit pricey but is worth it. Don't see myself buying another pots/pan set for a few decades ;)
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I had read more about these pots before I got them. They burn everything and the skillets have been stained black since the first time I used them. They are impossible to clean even with Barkeeper's Friend. Also, if you try to add anything to boiling water, the pot bubbles up and overflows immediately. I am throwing the entire 10-piece set in the garbage!"
4,Cuisinart cookware,Cooks and looks and great. Too early to see how well it cleans up.Arrived timely after purchase- Highly recommend
5,Fantastic!,"I've only had them a couple of weeks, but I absolutely love this cookware. Easy cleanup, even if things do stick (which isn't often). I cook eggs in my skillets without any issues at all. If things do stick, I just soak them for a bit and it all cleans up easy as can be."
4,Happy with Purchase,"Cookware set is wonderful. I really love it. Heavy duty and cooks great. Only thing is sometimes not as easy to clean as I might like. Takes a little extra effort. However, I really enjoy cooking with them."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased these pots in September. I tried to be very careful, cooked on low heat, washed by hand. Nonetheless, the pots burn and stain very easily. After just a couple of uses they looked like old, worn pots, with burn and stains that I cannot get out. I am very, very disappointed with them. I have been pleased with other Cuisinart products, so I am especially disappointed about these."
1,I can't believe I fell for the price...cookware stinks!!!,"I really did some research on cookware before buying this set in April 2010. Like many folks, we were on a budget and I was trying to save some money. I had been cooking with a set of Calphalon that I liked a great deal, but the coating was wearing off. So, I went with this set because of the price and it didn't have a lot of sizes and rave reviews!. I couldn't be MORE disappointed. The stockpot pitted the 1st time I used it. The skillet has a permanent burn on the side. Obvioulsy it is not non-stick, but rather everything sticks. I hate them, and that is strong for me. I have worked in restaurants and love to cook. I am now replacing the ""new"" cuisanart with All-Clad."
2,Wish I had my Farberware back...,"I gave my 30 year old set of Farberware away to an elderly friend who needed cookware. I'm not sorry I did that, but I wish I had it back and had given this crappy set away. My other pans were made in the good old USA out of REAL stainless that didn't pit, discolor, or look crumby after 30 years of hard use. With this set, the first time I fried up some potato pancakes in the small fry pan, the bottom discolored. I shouldn't have to do anything differently than normal cooks would do to keep the cookware in good order. JMHO, this set is making me wish I could afford the made in USA stuff. Saving up - can't wait to throw this in the trash."
5,Pan's are good so far!,This pan set was bought as a gift for an avid cook. I haven't had any bad reviews from the recipient so i must assume they are ok.As far as looks go they looked good on the picture and therefore i bought them.
5,Best pots I've ever owned,"I got this set for Mother's Day, along with the 5.5 qt saute pan, and have been using it exclusively since. I love, love, love these pots and pans! They heat up evenly and quickly - sometimes too quickly, so be sure to monitor the heat setting you use. I've found that using a medium-low setting cooks just about everything beautifully. I've had no problems at all with sticking, just be sure to use some oil or butter. I wanted to get a set that is dishwasher safe, and these are, but they clean so easily that I've handwashed them every time. Hot, soapy water in the pan while we're eating is all I've ever done and they wash like a dream. Occasional heat marks, but a touch of Bon Ami or Barkeeper's Friend and they're gone. I plan on buying a few other pieces from this collection to completely meet my needs, and I'm buying the 17 pc set for my daughter."
3,Spots,"I really like this set-it cooks quickly and well and is very attractive BUT it does not come clean in the dishwasher so it must be washed by hand and you need barkeepers friend to clean it .I have tried many times in my dw and it just does not work that way, so if you don't mind cleaning by hand go right ahead- the lids fit well, you get a nice selection of sizes and it is very well made. Worth it in my book, esp for the price."
1,Not sure what people like in these,"First time we used the frying pan it immediately turned black on the edges and remained that way no matter what we tried. The food burns and sticks regardless of what you do and one of the pans cracked near the top (no idea how). These are not worth anyone's time or money ... absolutely ridiculous! Cuisinart must be paying people to put good reviews up on these because they are thin, cheap, and extremely difficult to cook with."
3,Max resolution 480p.,"There's nothing wrong with this DVD player for everyday use, but if you invested in a true HDTV, you'll want a DVD player that not only can upgrade from 480i to 480p, but one that can handle 720 & 1080 as well. Action films need 720p for best (theater-like) results, while more sedate but richly detailed films look their best in 1080i.If your TV is ready for these true HD modes, why buy a DVD player that isn't?"
1,An unpleasant little story,"What an unpleasant little story. Men are portrayed as perverts, thieves and pimps; women are righteous prudes. A woman is _shocked_ that a man wants to be sexually dominated during phone sex, the police antics are completely unbelievable, and the plot is silly. I just read the Kirkus review here that says ""corny beyond belief,"" but I'd say that's being too kind. Its just plain dumb and a waste of time."
3,It will keep you talking...,"On the surface, Lip Service, by M.J. Rose, is a story about a woman, Julia, who delivers phone sex as research for a book she is collaborating on. The real story is beneath the surface and concerns the relationships Julia has with her husband, her therapist, her friends, and herself. What do we hide with the words we use and what assumptions do we perpetuate? In Lip Service, M.J. Rose explores these questions while providing an entertaining, provocative story that will keep your interest long after you've closed the book."
4,Very erotic and seductive . . . written intelligently.,"This book was very well written without out it being vulgar. Ms. Rose is a very classy author. Lip Service is a seductive novel which I thoroughly enjoyed. Haven't enjoyed a seductive book like this one since Lady Chatterly's Lover. Well written, seductive, and exciting. Looking forward to Ms. Rose's next novel . . . CAN'T WAIT!"
4,"An intense, erotic phychological love story.","Lip Service is an intense, erotic phychological love story. M. J. Rose has crafted a pychological thriller that is both disturbing and convincing. The book is fast paced and will grab you from page one and pull you into the world of Julia Sterling. The book gets deep into the psychological relationship of Julia and her husband and, especially, of Julia herself. She not only receives a sexual awakening but, also, a psychological awakening. The book was a compelling and satisfying novel."
2,You get what you pay for... MOSTLY!,"This little meter is disappointing... I guess I was expecting something a little more ""finished"".Yeah, it works, assuming you have experience using multi-meters. The ""operating instructions"" are at best minimal; and that's being kind. If you don't have some knowledge of how to use these kinds of meters, you'd be better trying something else. Don't want to beat this to death. But, I was surprised as to how really poor the documentation was.The meter seemed to be accurate enough for the average homeowner tasks. Compared to a Fluke or a Sperry, it's pretty much third class. I wouldn't recommend it. Look around for something a bit more expensive and I'm betting quite a bit better.A one word summary... ""Cheesy"""
5,Fun Old School Prank,Good old school prank. Most people won't bother to read a label if the general appearance is that of a brand they're familiar with. When someone falls for your offer of gum they'll get a mild shock! Great addition to any prankster's arsenal!
4,Nice pot with convenient insulated handles,"We've only used this pot a few times, but the insulated handles make it easy to handle without using pot holders. Heat conduction is average. It does the job."
1,Do not buy this lamp,"I purchased this lamp in October 2002 to use while doing detailed artwork and calligraphy. The 18W tubes were inadequate, and I had to use an additional lamp.The lamp broke down yesterday. New tubes (also very expensive) did not help. I also noticed that the transformer was always extremely hot, practically burning to the touch.I don't recommend this lamp."
5,Great add on to a Chef's Classic set,I ordered this to go with my 10pc. Chef's Classic set. It's built just as well as the other items and fits on top of both sauce pans very well. Price is not too bad either.
5,universal steamer,This steamer works with many sized pots. It comes with it's own lid. It's perfect!
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I thought I was ordering ""The Big Picture"" 2 DVD set by George Green. The description was not accurate enough, and I ended up with this turkey put out by the US ARMY Propaganda Brigade."
2,Mixed Review,The black case is very slim and hugs the player nicely while protecting it. It is stylish as well. However the armband is too long(unless you have huge biceps) and makes it unwieldly to wrap around your upper arm. The belt clip is flimsy and WHITE - which does not match the rest of the packaged elements which are all black. I would have looked harder for an alternate case if I knew the armband was too big and the belt clip was white.
4,Not bad for price..............,"I do wish that the clip on this was the same color as the ""hot pink"" cover that I got. The cover fit over easily but it took a little time to figure out how to attach the beltclip. Other than the fact that the armband came several weeks later in a separate shipment (they were out of stock at the time) this was a decent buy."
5,Beautiful and functional,"This set is both beautiful and functional! Easy to clean following care instructions, even and rapid heat conduction and oven safe which makes it a very versatile set in the kitchen. Excellent value and quality pieces."
3,Good-but hard to keep clean.,"I am pleased with the performance and style of the Cuisinart Chef's Classic. Looks good and cooks generally ok. I just wanted to mention a few problems I've had. 1. Dishwasher safe-the say ok but they don't recommend it because food particles from other items in the dishwasher may scratch the surface. 2. After one use, the pan interior surfaces fail to maintain the original luster. The manufacturer provides very specific cleaning directions, but even following them I find the pans hard to maintain. 3. They recommend using only lower heat-follow it! Foods burn easily even on medium heat."
5,oustanding products,"I got two sets a year ago, one for me and one for my daughter. To those i slowly added a lot of other pieces. Not only the price is unbeatable, this cookware is outstanding.... I also own some All-Clad, and I must say that the Cuisinart compares beautifully. I highly recommend this set!!!"
3,strange stain after second use,"After I used the sauté pan twice, I noticed some blue circle stains in it. Did anyone else have seen these? Is it normal or should I stop using it?Thank you"
1,Not good,"Not good, pitted and not even cooking. Bought the tramantina all clad from walmart...great stuff. Will not purchase the chef's classic brand again."
5,Great small set for apt or young person,"Purchased for my new apartment in NYC. Worked out great, small size to fit in tight kitchens. Great quality, easy to handle and clean."
3,It's very small!,"I recently ordered this brush for applying eyeshadow, and I was very disappointed when I saw the size. It is VERY short, about 4.5 inches, and the brush tip is very tiny. I would use it as a tavel brush or a crease brush. The brush itself works very well for it's size though, and cleanes itself easily."
5,Fantastic Play Alone Game,"I homeschool my kids and I bought this to keep my youngest kidlet (3) busy and happy while I was doing school with his older brothers. It was an instant hit! The only problem is that the older boys (6 & 12) want to stop and play with it too. I realized yesterday that it's time to get more tiles and more challenges. When my 3 year old accomplished his first pattern (2 half circles to make one circle) he had a smile from ear to ear and said, ""I wanna do it again, Mommy!"" and he said that after every card that he completed until they got too hard and then he was content to watch his brothers do the harder ones. I am excited to get our new tiles and more patterns. I might order the magnetic set for my 3 year old to help him keep his tiles in place as he fumbles around as well as being able to take them on an airplane for educational fun in the sky!Magnetic MightyMind"
3,"Fun, Educational and Challenging","My 4 year old son got this for Christmas, he loves it! He zipped right through the first 10-12 cards. It does get more challenging after that, but I look forward to watching him try to figure it out!"
3,Intellectual Playgrounds,"This book seems to line up with this analysis , Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) ""Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in 'philosophical propositions', but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and give them sharp boundaries."" I believe the above fits nicely with Nancy Cartwrights efforts,The Dappled World. I find the words within The Dappled World very washed and ironed,very tidy."
3,Be carefull,"This was a nice upgrade for my Palm E2. I was able to connect to the internet almost anywhere where there was wifi. It is great for saving time and space when dealing with a laptop on a daily basis. The only complaints that I have is the battery life really sucks the life out of my unit. Its also a pretty fragile card. I have to replace it because its not holding up to daily use. I keep it in a Body Glove case, but because of constent use, it is beginning to fall apart. Great casual buy. Can't wait for after market for cheaper prices"
3,Probably a great piece of hardware,"I think we are having hardware problems with the card reader on the Palm Zire 72. It will not read a memory card not the WiFi card. When we resolve that problem, I will change my report."
4,"works, but isn't nice to batteries","I'm using a Tungsten T3. I'm able to get online at a few places already, use instant messaging programs, browse the web (still waiting for a good palm browser that can read CSS).my only qualm is that the wifi card drains my battery rather fast, so any browsing, IMing, or reading of email will be all I can do with my palm, as long as I'm online. I've noticed that if I remove the card, I'll regain some battery life for a while.Good thing the T3 has a built-in rechargeable battery, or I'd be loosing a lot o' money."
4,Not too shabby...,"This works fine and I was happy with the speed at which I was able to do a Google search with the bundled software WebPro. Downloading email using the IMAP server was a little slower than using the web, but it worked out quite well using the T3's VersaMail email software.There are two minor downsides though:1) The range is about half that of a laptops WiFi card. But it's still good enough that if you're inside a Cafe or on the sidewalk outside a WiFi hotspot, you'll have no problems.2) It uses a lot of juice... But that's to be expected for something like this. Realistically though, you probably won't spend as much time surfing the web with this device as you would with a laptop. You'd do the occasional quick surfing, as well as downloading email, so battery life is probably acceptable for a majority of users.If you do need WiFi on your PDA, then you'll be very happy with this."
4,A little weird,"I enjoyed the book, it was very suspenseful and i liked all the traveling Seacourt did. But some things i found a little weird. But i can't say or i will give the book away, but its worth the $2i bought it for, but i would wait for paperback if i comes out in paperback."
1,IF YOU HAVE NO STANDARDS...GO FOR IT!,"If you're the sort who views punctuation, grammar, and the King's English as overrated and passe, then you might get through this book with your hair still intact. If, however, you demand reading material that would rate a passing grade from any sixth-grade English teacher, you might want to avoid this one!"
2,Very disappointed,The main part of this book--The Grand Inquisitor--was omitted. The acting was great and the tension between the brothers and their father was clear but this book is famous for the section that was for some reason omitted.
1,Paula Pandamonia,"This is a very short book for the price and it doesn't give much information. There are other books out there that are much better and informative. Treatment with several antidepressant and other medications show promise and no information on this aspect is given in this book. A combination of professional therapy by a psychiatrist or psychologist who had medical training and can support all needs should be found by anyone suffering with any impulse control disorder. Jail, institutions, and death are the outcome for all addicts if they do not recover. This is no different and should be dealt with by a qualified medical practitioner(....)"
3,my first MP3,"The software sent to go with this didn't work on my computer.(Musicmatch jukebox I believe.) I ended up having to call for support to figure out how to get music on it. Once you know how, it is very easy to load music from Windows media player. (I am not totally technically illiterate either. I follow what the manual tells me to do and in this case it didn't work.) The armband is way to small for an adult. I wore it on my wrist until my daughter and I switched. (She got a Sandisk from grandma for about the same price I paid for this. I think I like hers better as it has a light, holds more and size/shape is nicer.) I suppose for my my first MP3 player it is fine."
5,"Binge Thinking is a must have for parents, professors, and students!","I graduated from college this past summer. After reading Binge Thinking, I found that the stories told in the book are true to the real college experience. I wish I had the opportunity to read Binge Thinking prior to or during my four years, and I know Binge Thinking would have been a helpful tool for my parents as well. This book provides a better way of looking at tough times in college and reassures students that their feelings are not out of the ordinary. Also, I wish I had DB to help me through college, he is so smart!"
4,A fix at last,"As a homeowner who does most maintenance work myself, I've been a fan of B & D tools for a long time: basic, solid, dependable. That changed with this drill.The original charger was worthless; I resent having to buy an aftermarket product just to make my original investment worthwhile. In a nutshell, that's what this charger does; it works, and I'll use it until the two batteries I bought no longer hold a charge.Score a point for B & D, which got my money again. Now subtract ten for losing a loyal customer. My new circular saw is another brand, as I expect most of power tools will be in the future."
3,14.4 V batteries for B&D are marginal,"The charger I purchased to replace the absolutely worthless charger that came with the B&D; 14.4Vfirestorm drill kit does charge the batteries. However, I find that these batteries are less than desirable. They do not hold a charge and will expire after short periods of use. Spend the extra dollars and purchase a Makita, Milwaukee, etc."
1,B&D Battery Charger PS1MVC,"I bought this charger because it was listed by Black & Decker at their website and on the box as the correct one for 12 volt battery pack PS130. After receiving the charger, it became readily apparent that the battery would NOT fit the charger. After a half hour on the phone with B&D customer service, I was instructed to take the battery & charger to a local Black & Decker service center. At the service center, they scratched their heads, confirmed the obvious and exchanged the charge for a generic which fit the battery pack. It's not a good situation when the manufacturer cannot determine which of their own products are compatible with each other!"
4,Great choice,I purchased one of these when the charger for my B/D drill quit working. Since then I have gotten 3 others for people I know. Fast charge and has leds that give battery status. I highly recommend-- it would only be better if it fit in my Storm King case or had a case of its own for protection as it is plastic..
4,Sturdy,Excellent unit. Much better than the original. Charges quickly and efficiently. Glad I found this unit online. So far so good
5,It also works!,This charger seems far superior to the smaller one that came with the drill many years ago. This one was a bit more expensive than the replacement which was the same as the original - but it charges faster. I think that will be important when I find a project that will use a lot of juice this winter. Meanwhile I was glad to see even this more expensive model was a lot less than the same thing at a local store.
4,Very good but a cautionary note,"Product was very good. It does recharge in an hour as advertised, which is great. The only problem I had was my battery had been completely discharged for a long time (I got it handed down by my father-in-law). So, when I inserted the battery into the charger the ""replace battery"" indicator light went on. My father-in-law had hardly used the drill. Knowing the battery had to be nearly new, I plugged it back into the charger several times. After the third or fouth time, the charger proceeded to charge the battery. So, if your battery is completely discharged give that a try before replacing it."
4,Fast Charger decent price,I just recently purchased the B&D 1 hour pod style charger. I have the 14.4 V batteries and they are charged in about an hour. This is especially nice when doing long projects that require extensive battery use. I had been using the cheap one that came with my set which would take hours to recharge my batteries. This one is finished in about an hour. Good buy for the money I would say. No Cons yet at this point.
4,Black & Decker charger,"Would be better if it went up to 18 volts. Make one with different holes to charge at least three of the main brands. Have not gotten to use it much yet, but looking forward to Black and Decker quality."
5,Black & Decker Battery Charger,I received this item very fast. It charges my (14.4)batteries with no problem. I ruined 2 different chargers that came with my drills by not removing the battery. This charger does not have that problem You can leave a battery in the charger and it will not ruin the charger or overcharge the battery. I highly recommend this product.
5,Great Buy,This product was a great value. It was easy and convenient to use. I would definitely recommend this product to other buyers. This black and decker battery charger has made my renovations a lot faster and it only takes an hour to charge my tools.
3,wireless MP3 player,a bit overprized and the wristband is too tight. Headphones broke after a few uses (the hook that holds it over the ear); but it's still usable. Buttons are hard to push in.
4,Good mp3 player but the pedometer is a joke,"This item arrived yesterday. It is good looking and easy to operate. The wireless earphone is fantastic. Good sound quality.But the pedometer is a joke: it is too sensitive even I set the sensitivity level as low. I tried 10 steps, and it shows more than 20 steps counted. Even any movement of my arm caused several steps counted."
3,Problem with wireless headphones' battery life,"I've had my RCA S2501 MP3 player for about a month. Initially, it was great: Both the player and the headphones could go several hours without charging. (I run a lot -- usually an hour and a half a day. At first, I could go two or three days without having to recharge either part of the unit.)But in the past few days, the headphones have stopped holding a charge. When I charge the headphones, the orange light stays on continually. (It's supposed to go off when the headphones are fully charged.) And when I use the headphones, they die in about an hour.I've contacted RCA's tech support. Will let you know what I find out.Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Did not work!,"I purchased this product because I had one similar to it that I like very much. This one had wireless earphones so I purchased it for my husband. When I received it, it would not work. I am currently working on returning this product."
3,Motorman Ford GT40,"The model is most reasonably and fairly detailed for the price I paid. It is not detailed as Autoart, but then, I'm not paying $500! For the price ($70), this is a decently made product. I would recommend this product."
5,Both Beautiful!,Both Jim Key and Dr. Key were beautiful! What a lovely story...even better because it's true. Mim Rivas' research is extensive and detailed. It's good that a documentary is in the works...so that others will know the story...and perhaps read the book.
1,Melitta Momentum High Speed Brewer,"I rec'd this on May 7th '08 and it stopped working on May 18th '08. I think the thermastat is stuck, because it won't quit heating. The water is at a constant boil. Wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Beatles Celebration,Garbage-- don't waste your money on this one lads. The only yucks out of this video were those provided by the narrator's phony British accent. Might I recommend Yellow Sub if your in the mood for a little of the Fab Four.
1,Horrible,"I can't believe this DVD was actually released. Throughout the whole thing, not one note of Beatles music is played. NOT EVEN ONE TINY NOTE! It's all silly classical music and no Beatles are heard. After I saw this movie, I thought, ""This is junk!"" I mean, even I could make a Beatles documentary better than that, and I'm only in junior high! I've seen Beatles documentaries before, like the First US Visit and all the movies, like ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" etc. But THIS is just horrible, absolutely horrible. Honestly, don't waste your time with it."
2,Not as good as expected,I expected this DVD to be packed with Beatles songs and a history of the Beatles. Instead it walks through each of thier lives while they were Beatles explaining what it was they did. A bad DVD. The only good stuff is a few comments and some footage in the movie and the Additional footage they had of the Beatles coming home to the UK from the US. DO NOT rent this DVD it is a waste of your rental spot no matter if you get 3 or 8 DVD's at a time. It also came from San Jose which means that people like me in Minneapolis and people East of Minneapolis will have to wait a while for this movie that is not worth it. Skip this rental.
1,absolutely daft,"Boring, tiring, not good video quality and if it wasn't for the few rare ""home-taken"" postBeatles pictures i would throw it away..If you're a fan and really into the mania or want to have every single thing about The Beatles, then it's fine, otherwise don't spent your money in this.!Oh and for a Beatle-related film, there's an awful little stuff abour Ringo!!!"
1,Out of date and not worth your time,"I have had experience writing resumes for corporate jobs and just hoped that this book would give me some ideas for a law resume. It didn't. Actually, the book contained many poor examples of resumes that were unclear and poorly laid out. They were resumes I would never consider sending to someone who actually had the power to hire me for fear that the resume would immediately end up in the trash. Don't use these examples and don't waste your money."
2,Cute outside but doesn't compare to other houses,"I really like the color scheme and exterior details, but for the price there should either be more furniture included, or there should be enough room inside for extra furniture. The Dream Houses from the late 70's and early 80's had loads more room inside, and much more in the way of accessories. Even the old three story townhouse was more interesting! Don't waste your money!"
1,Only for the radical right,"This is bound to be a book that right-wing Republican supporters will love and one that non-Bush supporters will find hard to take. Sound bites and emotional photographs fail to come to grips with the facts and fallacies of the radical right, whose visible leader is President Bush. Oh - (and my bias will show here) - Bush probably thought ""Brazilian"" was a number-substitute, similiar to gazillian."
1,portrait of a Tyran,I cannot help myself to understand how fool people who have supported this guy??god bless america?? is this the argument which has to do with this guy ?? I don't think so. he hurts the image of USA in the whole world.
3,a unique group of films,"Ok, so the Howling sequels are not so great, but they're not so bad either. I personally have enjoyed each one, with the exception of 'New Moon Rising', the worst piece of garbage ever to grace the video market. Nothing will ever top the classic orginal, which I watch on a regular basis, but there is something about part II, the so bad it's good factor I guess, which is why I own each of these films on DVD. Parts 5 & 6 are no different...they each have their little moments that make them worthwhile plus I like the twilightzone feel they each have...could be related but not really... I give this dvd 3 stars..would've been 4 if there would have been some extras. Oh, and why does the Howling IV dvd cover art come from 2 different werewolf films? The front cover is from 'Werewolf' and the back cover pics are from 'Howling III', yet the plot description is clearly for Howling IV."
1,huh?!,"I think I read the same book everyone is ranting about. See, I couldn't get five chapters in. I yawned and shut it close. A moronic main character who spouts off as if he just finished reading a thesaurus for losers, and I'm supposed to feel pity for him? The man cries openly like a little wussy. Give me a break, if I saw this guy on the street, I'd laugh my ass off. This is one of those pompous, wordy, too smart for it's own good piece of garbage that papers love to push so they seem smart. Simply, I found the story and ideas within a bore. If it applies and/or matters I don't get ""Dilbert"" either."
2,A Worthless Read,"Although I readily devoured O'Brien's previous novels, Tomcat in Love merely tarnishes his once-spotless reputation as a brilliant writer. This utterly worthless novel is but a poor carbon-copy of O'Brien's previous work whose main themes have already been explored countless times. While the exheedingly annoying main character (Chippering) completely lacked redeeming qualities, this by itself could have been excusable and perhaps intriguing. However, Chippering additionally lacks true depth and experiences zero pyschological growth over the story's course, making it readily apparent that he is merely a repitious, poorly-drawn parody of the neurotic Vietnam vet O'Brein continually characterizes and apparantly cannot escape from. For true O'Brien fans, this book may provide minimal pleasure, but will most likely be ultimately disheartening. For those unfamilar with his work, skip this shoddy book and instead read his true masterpieces."
3,loved by those who idolized Portnoy's complaint,"That's the only explanation I can think of for all the great reviews this book has gotten. There was some wonderful writing in this book, but it left me more uncomfortable than amused. It was like watching one of those Woody Allen movies where the narrator obsesses about younger women, and you keep thinking about the fact that Allen is living with his step-daughter or whatever. Makes it hard to enjoy the talent sometimes."
3,"Great writer, mediocre book","Tim O'Brien is by far my favorite writer. He is extremely talented and I have read and re-read all of his novels. This book was a major change from his other tales, and while I found the book interesting and amusing, it wasn't nearly as real as his other stories. It was a good book to read on the beach, but I'm not going to re-read this one."
4,"Hilarious, clever -- but what a creepy hero!","I am a little embarassed to admit how much i like this book. O'Brien is a smart cookie and I always enjoy books that surprise me with the unexpected but not just random weirdness. I laughed out loud at the pathetic Chippering and thought of the list of guys I'd like to buy a copy for - heh! If you want to know what goes through the mind of a book-smart, life-stupid, self-absorbed womanizer this would be a start. And if you relate to this character -- SEEK THERAPY NOW!"
4,"wild, wacky,sad and oh so moving","tim,s books rip in the heart and make wild personal vendas seem so rightous"
1,What happened Tim?,"The hype surrounding this book reminds me of the emporer's new clothes- it is Tim Obien, so it must be good, right? Wrong! I loved every thing else he has written, but this book was a huge dissapointment. Funny?,- I don't see it at all. Anyone in the market for an almost new hardback?"
1,A claustrophobic mess,"It's hard to make a likeable book told from the perspective of an unlikeable character. I guess Tim O'Brien found this out. His lothario of a linguistics professor, Chippering, is so insufferable, you just can't stand to spend any more time with him than you have to."
1,"Unfunny, obnoxious, and, sad to say, unreadable.","I won't pretend to have read the whole book. I kept thinking, this is Tim O'Brien, it's going to get better. This narrator can't possibly be this hateful or dumb. Tim O'Brien can't possibly be behind such overly simplistic twaddle as ""Too Much Melrose Place"" -- right? Wrong! It gets worse. It's a shockingly bad book from one of my favorite writers. Please let this be his one monumental failure."
4,I just saw him read in Seattle! He's a good story teller!,"I went to a O' Brien reading last week, and I really had no idea who he was. He read, I laughed, I bought the book, I read, I laughed more, I cherish the book. Tim O'Brien is a funny guy with serious things to say. I say ""Get this book and read it, you'll smile!"""
3,O'Brien shows depth beyond Vietnam -- although not enough,"Tim O'Brien, perhaps the most vivid storyteller in the Vietnam canon of books, attempts to move beyond that mold in Tomcat in Love by writing a pseudo-contemporary story. Unfortunately, he doesn't go far enough.If you are familiar with Tim's earlier work, this is somewhat more of the same, in an albeit more hilarious situation.Similiar to the book Confederacy of Dunces in that the reader develops a love/hate relationship with the arrogant protagonist, I have to say that it dismays a long time O'Brien fan that he keeps making Vietnam a key role in his stories. I want him to move beyond his ""known"" life, and to be more imaginative about the modern world. He's that good of a fiction writer, and it's kinda annoying that he won't take up a totally new topic.In all, if you've never picked up any work by O'Brien, this is a funny way to start. But for those of us who claim O'Brien as our favorite author, Tomcat In Love travels down a familiar path."
3,Interesting!,"I have just finished this book and kinda wondered what the point is. Sure it has some great characters , kooky situations and Mr O' Brien's mastery of the English language. But what does it make me feel? Nothing really. I loved Going After Cacciato and The Things They Carried but this book just sits kinda uneasy in my heart!"
4,"""Tomcat"" is a great read, but it's not his best.","Stylistically, ""Tomcat In Love"" has everything we've come to expect from Tim O'Brien -- visceral prose; quirky, vivid imagery; a cast of eccentric characters (reminiscent of ""Nuclear Age""). This is a great, fun read. That said, I don't think ""Tomcat"" is O'Brien's best. It doesn't quite reach the level of ""Cacciato"" or ""The Things They Carried."" I'm happy this book marks a departure for O'Brien, and I think any book by him is worth reading at least once. It won't be remembered as his best, however."
2,Not at all what I expected.,"After reading The Things They Carried and Cacciato, and several other books by O'Brien, this was a let-down. His previous books have won or been nominated by the National Book Award and even the Pulitzer Prize. The other books are 5+ star novels. I didn't like the perspective, the plot, and I didn't find it funny. It was just okay, fair, and average. Loved his other books, especially The Things They Carried."
4,"Buy this around list price, NOT hundreds of dollars","Don't pay hundreds for this deck. This deck is still in print! It's available under a different listing with out the dash ""-"" in the name. Just search Amazon for Liber T Tarot. Or search for the ISBN of either: 0738705659 or 978-0738705651. When you find the other listing, the price is around list price.[...]"
5,Tough Stuff,"This book is for REAL war students, not about Nazi's...just about the brutal part of a vicious war. The Eastern front was the worst of all the places a German soldier could fight. A good reference and an invaluable tool for the student of what it was like then."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"I am absolutely appalled by the experience of trying to purchase this item. Despite the negative comments by other customers, I bought this item anyway. After several e-mails to Power-by-Hand, I never received download instructions. As a matter of fact, I never even received a response! Horrible customer service! Shame on amazon.com for allowing this vendor to remain on board. In trying to cancel my purchase, it took weeks to get a refund. If you want this product, you are better off downloading the most recent version from slashdata.com and paying the extra $10 to purchase it. You can even use it for a 30-day trial period! Good luck."
4,WELL WRITTEN,"Lately i have been reading a lot of James patterson and this book was a great mix up from Pattersaon. I dont like too go into the actuall plot of the book in my reviews but i suggest this for all readers of serial killer books youll enjoy the work of ""The Family Man"""
1,Do NOT purchase from JVC!!,"This DVD player completely zotted out under the 90 day warrenty. JVC has absolutely the worst repair and customer service imaginable! We took it into a service center and were informed that the player can't be replaced, it has to be fixed. Okay, 6 weeks and inumerable phone calls later, we are told that the parts needed are indefinitely backordered and that they STILL will not replace the DVD player! We were also informed that the JVC company isn't concerned with an individual customer or whether we purchase from them again. We are going to the BBB to see if they will give us some assistance. Protect yourselves and purchase a system from a company that actually cares about their customers!"
3,Does What It's Supposed To,Like my title says it does what it's supposed to do and seems to give a quick and accurate hydrometer reading.
2,Cardio Dance Express Workout; Tone up & lose weight - great for active seniors too,"This is really not for seniors. It would be good for someone under 55. I did not like it, so I do not do the exercises."
5,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YELLOW PAGES,"I've heard this author speak, and everything he says about marketing and yellow pages and a lot more is in this book. Hard to imagine a better book on the subject, it's got to save or make any small business person a lot of money."
4,THE ONLY BOOK OF ITS KIND,A very fine resource for any small business person who advertises in phone books. It covers everything you'd ever want to know about yellow pages and quite a bit about small business marketing in general.This should save any yellow pages advertiser money. And it should make them money as well.
4,Why has Amazon removed the names and emails of reviewers,"This guy is right about the anonymity, though perhaps a touch overly suspicous. The problem is that Amazon has now removed the names and email addresses of the reviewers, identifying most of them only as ""a reader"" or ""an Amazon customer."" The only ones that are left seem to be those who have set up an Amazon profile or Amazon top reviewers or maybe those that are the most recent. I'm not quite sure of the criteria. In any case, it's not very helpful. When I bought my first copy of this book several years ago I actually emailed a couple of the reviewers. Now that's no longer possible."
5,A fantastic resource,"This text is by far the most readable book on statistics I've ever read. In addition, the software written by this author (GraphPad Prism) is also the most user-friendly and intuitive package available. In my opinion, the major benefit of this book is that it gets the reader to understand the conceptual basis of various experimental designs and statistical analyses, rather than blindly dumping data into a statistical package and hitting ""go""."
2,Disappointing and mediocre,"Not as bad as the author's Red Death, but nothing special. It's light reading, but there's a lot better stuff out there. For more comment see my review on Red Death. For better writing and reading try Barbara Hambly (especially Bride of the Rat God), Laurell Hamilton, Tim Powers, Philip Pullman, or numerous others. Sorry Elrod, you may be prolific, but based on these two novels, I can't recommend spending time or money on your books."
1,Wrong size,"I purchased this, but unfortunately cannot install it properly, due to the extensive alien anal probing I endured in the 1960's. The package should be clearly labeled with ""NOT FOR USE BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED PRIOR TO PURCHASE"". I could have sent it back for a full refund."
2,Not as good...,"I bought this to replace my old Sub-Etha Sense-O-Matic that was not working properly. However, I find that the UFO-02 Detector is not nearly as powerful or as accurate at detecting any local space traffic as my old Sub-Etha model was. At least my Elctronic-Thumb still works fine, so I can still hitch a ride when the UFO-02 Detector does register accurately. I will be replacing this as soon as I can find a new Sub-Etha model."
4,Why the nonsense and disinformation?,"This product works. I don't understand why there are so many nonsensical reviews. Are there really so many bored or mentally ill people with nothing better to do with their time?The UFO-O2 Detector detects electromagnetic disturbances, period, and it does that effectively. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because it could use a sensitivity control and an easier way to reset it."
4,FAULTY! Causes blindness!,"I've owned my UFO-02 for several weeks now. I upgraded after my '01 model went haywire when Mitt Romney announced he was running for president. Clearly a coincidence. Hang in there Mitt, it's about time we had a gay president. Anyway...Every time this thing goes off, the flashing causes me to go temporarily blind. The next thing I know I'm naked, wet and can barely walk without defecating on myself. I have complained numerous times to the manufacturer, but my Mandarin Chinese is terrible. Curiously, so is theirs. Coincidence? Probably not.I've also noticed that my cats are terrified of me now. I'm not sure if it's related, but I have noticed that they are much more violent with me every night when it's time for their shower. I rated the unit at 4 stars because while it is a lifesaver on long flights, I feel it could use some functional improvements. I'm looking forward to model 03 which I have heard will have a ""Push To Talk"" feature. Blessings upon the name of Klorg."
2,The CD does not play on my CD players,The title says it all. The CD just simply cannot be read by my four CD players. Too much trouble to send it back. It is unlikely that the next CD will work. If the recordings are important to you don't take a chance.
3,Neuro--what?,"Patricia Churchland takes on the incredible task of applying our current (and incomplete)knowledge of neuroscience to basic philosophy of mind problems. While the task is a worthy and interesting one, her prose clearly reads more like a biology textbook than a clear and compelling piece of philosophical work. Churchland clearly has enthusiasm and eagerness to convince us all of the connections between brain science and philosophy of mind. But, her efforts get bogged down in biological details and an overscientific writing style. This book is probably only enjoyable for the neuroscience enthusiast (not the materialist skeptic) who wants reassurement that the discipline has all the answers to the mysteries of the mind."
3,agree to disagree,"it is a great book in understanding how the brain works, develops, from a deeply philosophical aspect. though I do not agree with some of the authors overt, and implied conclusions (which I will leave to the reader to discover on their own), I really enjoyed reading it and recommend it."
3,So-So reading,"I bought several of these books and the accompanying video thinking we'd offer a course on A Life Worth Living...after all, we LOVE the ALPHA course and thought this would be a good follow-up for our ALPHA graduates. By the third class, we'd lose just about everyone! It's just not as relevant or interesting. I've heard of others who did well with it so perhaps it was us...still, I cannot in good faith, recommend it for a course...maybe just a nice book to read."
5,Vital to the Study of Joinville's Work,"Maureen Slattery's argument concerning the primary biography of Louis IX is an invaluable resource to anyone reading de Joinville. She takes the utmost care to account for the different modes of research (namely, what Joinville saw, heard, and read) which are of particular importance considering the date of the authorship, or more importantly the fact that it was written prior to the invention of the printing press. Slattery has gone to the greatest lengths to uncover all that one must know while reading this monumental work."
2,Disappointed,"This was the first flight simulator I've used, and after reading some rave reviews about it, I was really disappointed with the scenery. I was expecting much more color and detail, but found too much generic patterns that didn't turn me on. I have a 500 MHz PIII with 128 megs of RAM. The planes are fun, but the scenery was really boring with a lot of flickering and visual instability. I ran the program on my friend's 1 Gig Athlon with 258 megs of RAM and a Nvidia G2 graphics accelerator, but there was no real difference. I was also disappointed at the lack of shadow from the planes as they approach the ground, which means that there's no way of telling how close you are until you crash.I played this game for about 6 hours total, then got bored and uninstalled it. It's quite a lot of fun, the planes are nice, but the scenery is a drag."
5,The Cincinnati Subway,"I grew up in the Cincinnati area and had heard the rumors about the underground tunnels and the Subway system that never was, but no one seemed to know what happened. Well Allen answers all these questions and more. How and why it started, and why it was abandoned. The book almost reads like a novel, with good guys and bad guys, politics and the war. It is full of beautiful pictures with clear captions and would be wonderful addition to anyone's collection about the early history of Cincinnati."
5,R.L.Stine is the best!,He wrutes as any pro can but better! Fear Hall is the best I read well all the Fear books are the best!
5,Betrayal Of Trust,This book was a well-conceived and tightly woven thriller. I read a new book every week and this was one of the best stories I've ever read.
5,A must-have for any harem fan.,"After stumbling onto this on Netflix, I felt the need to get this on home video. For a harem the humor is there. If your not into this kind of humor, (where the main character gets into so many sexually awkward moments with others) then this anime is not for you.The HD is phenomenal! (for an SD remaster) If you have a good HDTV like mine (which has a color balancer) You will not be disapointed. At 1080p its pretty, (esp the girls, ha) bright, vibrant, and crisp.The story is not too bad either which is the center of thi guy's problem with these ladies. I'll leave it at that cause I try not to spoil anything. Again its a good anime if you're into this kind of humor. I reccomend it."
4,Great figure has a trait that manufactures can learn from.,"Till I got this figure I never believed that a figure could have a tail that was possible but this one does.The figure it self has the classic 5 joint style, But the tail is a soft bendable plastic that has yet to crack or break off, So you can have a lot of fun with it."
2,Omg...,"Wow. Just another great example of unbelievably. I can hardly believe that they wrote this. The story and writing is totally sophomoric. They have the drop on them and instead make an unrealistic capture. It is the worst, but then maybe I don't watch enough TV. I never do. I guess that is why the writer's focused on T'Pol and her skin tight suits. It must be what kept it on the air for 4 years. Almost all the crew had a fantasy reenactment with her. It must have been on the writer's fantasy too. I only wish they would have done better."
2,No title,This is an episode tacitly about homosexuality and Vulcan aids. The social commentary was so heavy it broke through the fourth wall.
3,* Better than the First Season for sure!,"As a DIEHARD Star Trek fan, I find that with most of the new series a couple of seasons have to go by before the writing and acting start to become palitable. Enterprise is no exception. I wanted to give the 2nd season 2(**) stars but hesitated because it hurts me too much -- I love everything about the concept of Star Trek even when it is not good. However, being brutally honest, while the 2nd season is better than the first, it still is not that great. The 3rd season is far better with the introduction of the Xindi race who try to build a machine to destroy earth based on another races prophecy (or manipulation).Get the 2nd season to have a complete set -- also because the show is cancelled, so there will be some nostalgia there ... but don't expect the depth of TNG or DS9. I'm sure that is why the show was cancelled. Shameful but true."
4,Slight improvement,"Season 2 of Enterprise led us to the show picking up pace a bit. Trying to avoid spoilers, I was VERY disappointed that we didn't get a payoff on the potential story arc that was established in Season 1. We do get to know characters better and we do see the Enterprise crew getting their space legs. The pacing of this season, similar to Season 1, is a bit off. It is definitely worth watching to prepare you for the phenomenal arcs that come in Season 3 and Season 4 of Enterprise. To please the avid Trekkies out there, we also get introduced to some really important Star Trek races (like the Romulans) and see many explorations of how familiar notions like the Prime Directive were formed. Make it through Season 2 and you'll love Seasons 3 and 4."
4,A very well-written novel by an almost undiscovered author,"If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't! The movie is very good, the book is much, much superior. The author, Andrew Neiderman, is also the ghost-writer of deceased V.C. Andrews, but his writing under his own name is much better than with hers in my opinion. Everytime I read a book by Andrew Neiderman I am always shocked by the way his characters are developed, and how he are always surprised by their atittudes.More to his credit, I'd say that Andrew has one of the most incredible minds. None of his books are similar to others, and his crazy mind is always working on an intelligent thing.THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is just a display. It's the kind of book you read in only one seat. Believe me, Andrew is good. And this book is just wonderful.Marco Aurelio"
2,Very Disappointing!,"I expected much more from this cat. Why? For two reasons. First, he's always been one of the standout emcees on Wu collabos, and after Gza he's my favorite in the Wu. Second, with Ayatollah handling half the production, I expected much more. The only stand out cuts on this lp are ""Vendetta, That Nigga, City High and Framed"" with G Rap and Streetlife. The rest of the album is garbage. The beats are awful (where the hell was the RZA, and Pete Rock? Why didn't deck produce any of the joints?), and songs like ""Get Right"" (the hook is terrible) and ""Bumpin and Grindin"" sound like joints you'd expect to here from lame cats like Jay Z and Nelly. The lyrics are not vintage Deck, and the beats are very sub par. If you can come by the four cuts I mentioned earlier without buying the album, they are worth having. As for the album, it belongs in the two dollar bin at your local Wal-mart or K-mart. Leave it alone!"
2,Pleasant but forgettable,"A few nice melodies, a couple of interesting lyrics, the voice that still sounds as pretty as ever - but nothing here is all that interesting, and on the whole, this falls way, way short of the standard she set with Wrecking Ball and Red Dirt Girl. All of these songs sound like leftovers from the previous two albums, stripped of the production that Daniel Lanois and Malcolm Burn gave to them, even though both are involved with this new record. It just never takes off. The first forgettable Emmylou Harris album in a long time."
1,One Song Does Not an Album Make,"Emmylou Harris is a wonderful singer, but after listening to this album, she should continue singing other people's songs, and stop writing her own (All of these songs were written or co-written by her except ""Plaisir d'Amour"" which she arranged). All of these cuts sound almost the same. There is one marvelous song, the next to the last one on the album: ""Lost Unto the World"" which has passion and character. As for the rest of the songs, the lyrics are poetic, but thin and the music is lyrical, but without a winning tune in the batch. I love most of her work, but this one is a LARGE disappointment."
4,Yet Another Solid Album from Emmylou,"While already a legend in country music circles, in 1995 Emmylou Harris teamed up with producer extraordinaire Daniel Lanois to create one of the most amazing albums ever recorded, ""Wrecking Ball."" Since 1995, every album by Emmylou has attempted to recreate the sound and mood of ""Wrecking Ball,"" and all have been beautiful albums.In my opinion, ""Stumble Into Grace"" is not nearly as good as ""Wrecking Ball,"" nor even as good as ""Red Dirt Girl"" or the live album ""Spyboy."" While it has moments that rival those projects (especially her tribute to Johnny and June Carter Cash, ""Strong Hand""), but the songwriting is not as consistent.If you don't already own ""Wrecking Ball,"" ""Spyboy,"" and ""Red Dirt Girl,"" then my suggestion would be to start with them - all of them are simply amazing from beginning to end. On the other hand, if already own those three, then you will probably like ""Stumble Into Grace"" at least well enough to make it worth the purchase."
5,Great Classic Movie!,I think that this movie os a great movie for anyone of any age! No wonder it won Academy Award for best picture! It is three hours long but all three hours are entertaining. I would reccomend this movie to anybody!
3,Star-Studded Epic that has not Aged That Well!,"One of the most expensive films in it's time and it certainly is a feast for the eyes. But unfortunately this film has lost much of it's charm over time, it now seems overdone and overlong. But it sill has some nice things to offer, mainly all those picturesque landscapes and all those cameos, over 40 major stars appear in small roles, the easiest to spot are Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Peter Loore and Buster Keaton. One of the major assets of the film is Cantinflas, Mexico's greatest comedian, in his only American film brings the perfect comic touch to the film. One of the major flaws is that the film doesn't make full use of his comedic abilities, one or two scenes of Cantinfla's usual slapstick would of made the film more tolerable. David Niven is in top forma as the elegant and punctual Philleas Fog. A very young and darkened Shirley MacLaine appears in a small role as a beautiful Indian princess. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
3,Worth Seeing Once,"After the first 45 minutes, I wondered if I'd lost my mind to continue watching a movie so stunningly boring and lacking in plot development. Everybody knows the premise of course. The fabulously wealthy Phineas Fogg wagers he can circumnavigate the globe in an unprecedented 80 days, whereupon he and his manservant Passepartout set off to do it. If you read Jules Verne's book, you would think making a movie of it would be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, this movie was made in just that style. Anyway, in memory of Jules Verne, and because I thought it must have won 5 Oscars for some reason, I just had to see what happened next, and it did begin to pick up after they arrived in India. Or perhaps my expectations by then were lower. The photography is superb. The cast has dozens of cameos, including Buster Keaton as a train conductor. But the flat-footed direction disappointed me. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't intend to watch it again."
2,Poor Quality for the price,"Although the film is still very enjoyable, I was very dismayed at the quite poor quality of the video image. It is very annoying to pay a premium price for a dvd and then discover that the imaging is very poorly done. I do not understand why they had to cut this dvd without good clarity. The dvd simply comes off as ""fuzzy""---this is very disappointing!"
2,mediocre,"I have always regarded Pachelbel's Canon in D as one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but this piano arrangement is simply plain and uninteresting. The chords and melodies are weak and empty compared to the celestrial richness of the original. The essense of the song is lost, and the main theme has been dramatically changed.With the exception of the first page, most of the arrangement does not even resemble the original. If you want an accurate and artistic recreation of the masterpiece, don't bother with this mediocre arrangement."
3,Study Guide for the Florida Law Enforcement Officer's Certif,"I found a lot of useful question information, but this book is now outdated. Copy I received was in good condition but was from 1996."
2,The Ads are wrong!,"Even though I really enjoy this TV show and recommend it highly, the ads for it are wrong. I ordered the 2-DVD 10 Episode/ 4 Hour version and got the single disc version(5 Episodes/2 Hours). Since the price is low, it wasn't too bad, but I wanted the 2 disc set as advertised. Otherwise, it's great."
2,I received a defective one,It was good while it lasted. I had this item for 30 days and it stopped working. I am going to return it for a new one.
4,It didn't suck,"I bought this DVD and Zombie Strippers at the same time, and let me say that Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was the DVD I expected to suck. It was, however, just the opposite. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was actually pretty darn good for a low budget horror movie, and even with its big star, Jenna Jameson couldn't save that other piece of crap.The plot is your standard zombie movie story with some refreshing twists. No military experiment or radiation here. Crack whores smoke glowing crack rock thus starting the zombie epidemic. Plenty of laughs and gore to keep things moving along. The special effects are pretty rediculously awful in a few scenes, though. Good dialouge and characters, especially the Samuel L. Jackson-ish pimp guy. Sure, this movie is bad, but its a lot of fun and definately way better than a lot of low budget horror films out there. I liked it a lot.I'd recommend this DVD over Zombie Strippers for sure."
4,Very Talented Musician with a wit&sense of what is happening,Randy Newman is a trip He has a Humor quality in His work but yet is Dead Serious about Surroundings&Conditions.forget some of His Soundtrack work in recent years&just concentrate on His Songwriting&how certain things He wrote Pre-dated things that later came to pass.I enjoy His Voice&Playing.He is a very straight-forwarded Dude as a Artist.
2,Good Product but expensive,"Good Item but too expensive. We all have the problem with our surge protectors female receptacles being too close together. This shorty extension cord should be cheap, but because it serves a much needed purpose, the Market (us buyers) take it in the back side and pay the price. These work, but every time I look at them I feel like I cannot sit down for the pain."
5,"260 Thread Count Down Alternative Comforter, Full/Queen","A gift for my daughter. She loved it, great quality, and it is wearing well."
4,Must be Professionally Cleaned - Not machine washable....,"That is the only real flaw that comes with this comforter. It does have a little weight to it, which is nice. It does feel more like a cotton filling than true down, but is still cozy none the less. I purchased the Microsuede duvet for $19.99 (which is VERY nice by the way at 50% off and is MACHINE WASHABLE!) to go over the comforter, so hopefully, it wont have to be washed for a while. But when it does, it will be machine washed and we will see what happens at that point I guess. You can not see in the stock photo, but the comforter is actually covered in silky stripes, which gives it a very fancy appearance when you actually see it in person. Nice value and reasonable quality for the price. I mean $50 for a King size comforter.... that's a pretty great deal in its~self."
5,Made someone very happy!,"A belated Chrsitmas gift for my daughter, that made her one very happy girl!Great quality and price! She currently living in the cold and rainy Northwest. The comforter has defintily made this an warmer, and more comfortable winter season for her!"
5,an important work..one must read,"I read this book in 2 days, and could not put it down. Now I am in the process of re-reading. I never knew much about leprosy but now feel as if I understand the disease and the horrible fate that these untreated people went through, yet, the beauty of their souls shine in Mr. Taymans book. A great book, one you cannot forget. gm"
5,Sensitive and Glorious!,"Having been to Molokai many times, and taken the tour into the settlement, I was naturally interested in this book. Though there have been several pamphlet-like histories of Kalaupapa, and also some picture books, no writer had attempted to tell the whole story of the place. I'm glad that Tayman did. His account is wonderful: touching, terrifying, and terribly haunting.I've been fortunate enough to meet a number of the residents of Kalaupapa, and I can honestly say that this book protrays them as they truly are: noble, slightly crusty, and often very funny. I've read that a few residents are a little upset about the book, which strikes me as odd, given the place of pride they occupy in it. (Easier to understand, but less forgivable, are the bitter snipes of rival historians and authors. I'm sure they wish they had written The Colony.) I recommend this book enthusiastically!"
2,Skip this one but don't give up on Sarton,"I am a great fan of Sarton's, but this book is certainly one of her lesser lights. A tempestuous, immature young man goes to Europe, has a fling, and becomes the sort of fellow who could and will marry the girl next door. Frances is unappealing in either incarnation although neighbor girl develops color in both her cheeks and her personality during her summer away from him. The most intriguing character is his dead mother; perhaps she died from the stultifying intellectual blather of her family and friends.Along with his transformation from cad to mensch, Frances goes from Francophile to All-American. Unclear why as he still views American landscapes as ugly and American faces ""like cows, bland and empty."" No secret what Sarton's political inclinations are, but she doesn't usually let them shine through in such an effete, unpleasant way."
1,Poorly done product. Needs real overhaul,I bought this product hoping to find a spanish-language video for my young child. We already speak spanish at home and wanted to reinforce it.This product is horrible. The graphics are poorly done and ancient so they don't grab a child's attention in this day and age and the dialogue and story are boring. It is also difficult to understand what they're saying as the audio isn't clear either. It's way too expensive for what you're getting and my son never got interested in the product. What a waste of my money.I got stuck with mine as I didn't return it within 30 days so I'm giving it to the Salvation Army as I find it worthless.
4,Sounds of the South,Very good summary of songs you might hear if you lived in Louisiana. The music can capture the emotions of people who like any genre of music.
2,Bobby was Long gone when they put this on disk.,"The movie was one of the most realistic in acting, community interaction and just plain New Orleans don't give a damn attitude. The music incorporated into the movie balanced everything and gave it the spark of real life drudgery. I have been searching for the soundtrack and finally found at Amazon and I thought here goes, good music has arrived. When I played the CD It was a totally different atmosphere, close to funeral sounding and lacking in any feeling of being there. Sorry not what I expected.Love Song for Bobby Long"
3,Murderous mitts mean mediocre movie.,"Mel Ferrer plays concert pianist Stephen Orlac, who descends into a maelstrom of madness when he loses his hands in a terrible accident and has them replaced by the homicidal digits of a mass-murderer. Yes, it's the classic 'right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing' scenario. Are the hands posessed? Or is Orlac just bonkers?Admittedly the film itself is rather disjointed and badly paced (Mel Ferrer in particular gives a weak portrayal of Orlac) but it gains three stars solely for the performance of Christopher Lee as the evil magician who tries to goad Orlac deeper into insanity. Lee hams it up in a completely over-the-top Evil Genius way whenever he's on screen, but the sheer strength and audience interest lent by his presence is a welcome relief from the insipid blandness of Orlac's angst.If you're after ironic laughs rather than scares, cheesy special effects, and a bang-up acting job from Lee, this is your film."
5,Fantastic,It is great! My friend for whom I bought it absolutely loves this show and it shipped very fast and in perfect condition.
5,Great Fun!,I love the Cosby Show and this is one of my favorite seasons! One of my favorite episodes is when Cliff dreams that he and the men are pregnant...it cracks me up! You will love this season with the addition of Olivia...she is a great actress at that age. Enjoy!
5,simple and expandable,"I am a repeat customer of this product. I have owned the other brands (Laserline and Fellowes). The advantage of the Allsop is that they are stackable, and modular. The other brands do not allow for easy storage of the double-CDs, and the new cardboard jackets, like those used for the Kingston Trio--The Capital Years, and The Fantastics (original broadway musical). The 25-unit size is a sensible span of inches to categorize my music (and comedy) CDs in their own sections. I have used the other brands' tower style, and short-box style. The one that allows best for growth is the Allsop 25-unit."
3,Interesting Read,Learned a bit about real history of how Saudi came to be a Kingdom. Didn't change my opinion of the royal family at all. Pictures were nice addition.
2,Disconcerting to have a mouse eating all your food,"I am shocked by all the positive reviews. I actually found it disconcerting that a mouse is raiding the pantry eating crackers, pickles, corn flakes, cheese, milk, cookies, peanut butter, jelly, bread, and many other items while the occupants of the house are sleeping. Had the mouse been helpful, such as making lunch for the children while they sleep it would have been cute. But, there is no humor, the mouse it in it for himself, and he leaves a mess. The only two real positives are that I thought the artwork was exceptional, and the sentences rhyme."
1,Not Beauty and the Beast,"I got this book, thinking it would be a retelling (or retooling) of the Beauty and the Beast tale. It's not. The first chapter opens with the main character in bed with his mistress. If the fact that he's scarred figures into the story at all, it's only ancillary. The book is, in every other way, simply a romance-book trope. The story and writing and incredibly anachronistic and derivative. There is nothing new or interesting about the characters. Really not worth the paper it's printed on."
2,Not a fashion critic - a book reader.,"The book was ok. It was cute, but to me, fashion is a screen print sweat shirt and Levis. I couldn't care less about all the latest or even what once was the latest fashion trends. The story was fine, the rest distracting."
3,"Decent, but not what I expected...","I was expecting a ""high loft"" blanket...i.e. one that is fluffy. However, this blanket is pretty flat.However, I have a full-size bed and the blanket is very large for my bed, which is nice.I have washed it once and it does not really show any abnormal wear (some loose threads and balls of lint were present).The satin lining is also pleasant and the blanket does look high-quality."
2,Uninteresting,"I couldn't get into this book at all. It had no plot and unlikeable characters. And it's not even that --- I can read books with no plot and unlikeable characters, (I'm a Bret Easton Ellis fan) but it takes an incredible amount of talent to make that compelling. I just couldn't get through this book; the characters seemed whiny and the dialogue was very unnatural. You *want* to feel bad for the characters, like how Dodge is estranged from his family and how Kay lost her baby, but I found myself not caring about them at all. I also found it completely unrealistic that 24-year old Billy would want to spend his weekends with his mother and her friends. I like some of the author's language, so the book gets two stars instead of one, but to put it bluntly, the book is contrived and dull."
2,HUH?,"I admit I read the WHOLE book. Why I still am not sure. The 1st chapter was very confusing. Later as I met all the characters I could not help thinking how these 40 somethings(!) who supposedly had creative type jobs etc could maintain such self-absorbed, boring and alcohol dependent life styles. Did anyone else think they all seemed emotionally stuck in their early 20s? I remembered being at times like this when we were in college and right afterwards (thinking about sex all the time etc) but somewhere along the line moved on.....the only character I really liked was Dodie. At least she was productive."
3,Not too impressed,"The wheel is a deep dish so if you have issues with arm/leg length, this will not help even though its smaller than stock wheel. If anything, it may even leave less room for the left leg when pressing the clutch as it will hit your knee cap. The finish almost looks like chrome, way too shiny and reflective. I returned this wheel and bought a cheaper one that looks just like this one, has a flat dish, true satin/brushed finish and the quality of the leather feels and looks better. The good thing about this wheel is that it has the bottom step in the back that goes into the cut of the steering column. The wheel I went with does not have this step but this can be easily fixed with washers."
4,Simply gorgeous,"One of the places that most inspired Matisse was Morocco, a country of huge contrasts, vivid colors and dramatic landscapes .I missed the landmark exhibition for which this book served as the catalog, but I purchased it after vacationing in Morocco. Matisse's view of the country emphasizes the colors of Moroccan cities and landscapes -- intense orange-reds and azure bluesz. It is also informed and inspired by Moroccan design, which combines Mediterranean and Islamic elements to beautiful effect."
3,TMNT Vol. 6,"To be honest, I had to give this DVD an average rating. More exploration of the episodes will be needed. Once that is done, I will re-rate it."
4,Shredderville,"Season six was another fairly good season. I remember the episode ""Shredderville"", good timing for the release because this is the It's a Wonderful Life call back. The show got weird starting with the seventh season."
5,The Sac and Fox Indians,This book appears to be the standard for history of the two tribes. Informative and interesting.
3,To heavy,"I purchased these for my wife and they were to heavy for her to hold very long, they have good optics but wife unhappy with them."
5,Very pleased with this ball,"Thick material, nice graphics with names of places, plastic loop on top that you could tie a string to.Very cute."
2,Great map but not durable,This toy barely made it two weeks with intensive playing. The material could be significantly more durable. Not recommended over a traditional globe.
3,One of my favorite spanish comedy movies,"I love this movie. I bought 2. One was for me and the other was a gift for a relative. As much as I love this movie, I have to complain.*** There is a part where I can tell the recording was stopped as if cutting out a commercial. It does not seem original. The first part of the actual movie is nice and crisp, then after that cut the recording is not so clear. It looks old with static lines appearing through the rest of the movie.I wish the seller would've stated the condition of the movie.Other than that the movie itself is fabulous. It is very nostalgic for me. Brings back good memories. Too bad it is not of best quality as expected."
2,This book contains little new information.,"I have always loved Gerald Durrell's works, and thus was looking forward to learning more about him as a person. I am now bogged down half way through this large biography, and must report that I have learned little or nothing new of any significance. Indeed, the first half of the book consists largely of material from Mr. Durrell's own works. After pointing out several times that Mr. Durrell's writings were often inaccurate, Mr. Botting's reliance on them for his own biography seems somewhat inconsistent, to say the least. One can obtain the same information more enjoyably and more informatively from reading Mr. Durrell's (and, indeed, Jacquie Durrell's) own works. The essence of Gerald Durrell may be found in his own writings; it will not be found in this biography."
5,banksy the man,this is a must have 4 any art fan if u r a hip hop fan streetart or just good poking fun at people and getting them to think then buy buy buy if you like war dont like to laugh and have no eye for art then stay away
4,inspiring and entertaining,this is a nice coffee table book for suburbans like me who want to appear edgy. banksy's work is brilliant.
5,Great addition to book collection,"Awesome book! I have been a fan of Banksy's artwork and was excited to have this book. The artwork is great, as usual, and the quotes, letters, and other things in addition to his artwork make it a really enjoyable book. The description said it was slightly used, but when I received it, it was practically in brand new condition. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Worth every penny,"It's a great book, one that definitely puts Banksy in its rightful place even in the minds of people that have no idea about urban art and art anarchism. Insight from Banksy himself, the hooded mistery, photographs of some of his most famous pieces, this book has it all. A must read for any and everyone."
4,Curious about this 'Banksy' character,"I purchased this book after Banksy's wall sold on Ebay for near $400,000! I was intirgued to see more and found the book to be quite interesting. For an art book virgin it is interesting and a great piece of pop culture. I would recommend it to anyone-but caution that it is probably not appropriate for young children due to some of the content."
1,Enormous disappointment,"I ordered this book as a gift for my daughter, who is an enthusiastic young flute student. (I even paid 10 bucks expedited shipping to get it here for Christmas, but that's my fault for waiting until the last minute). I wanted a book that would inspire her love of the instrument, and particularly appeal to her as a young woman aspiring artist. This book is simply an alphabetical listing of composers with some summary biographical info. It is 9"" x 6"" in size and is bound in ordinary laminated cardboard. $87? Are you kidding me? I inferred too much from the price. This is a library reference book for someone doing research, at best. Not something that many people would want to own. I'm returning mine (now I have to figure out some other gift.)"
2,Terrible instructions make this a poor choice for kids,"The instructions provided with this kit show pictures that don't match to what's provided. The circuit board won't connect to the chassis, and there are only general instructions for one robot -- not details for each of the three. After my 12YO spent a few frustrated hours trying to figure out what to do, we got my brother (a mechanical engineer) to come over and help us put this together.The robot works great once you throw the instructions away and get an engineer to help you assemble it. The buzzer is still maddening, though."
1,Logitech...Lottatrash,"After using this game controller only about 2 months it quit working properly. Left analog stick went weird. Everytime I tried to play a game using it the character or whatever kept moving forward. To stop this action I had to pull the left analog stick toward me. When I let go of it it continued again moving forward. I changed the batteries twice still the same. I checked every possible thing that may be causing the problem but no luck. I did not abuse the controller in any way. What a waste of money. I still have the original controllers that came with my PS2 and they still work great, and I bought it three years ago!!"
5,Great controller,Just as good as the wired controller that came with the PS2. I can't tell the difference. Only problem is that you can't use two at the same time.
3,it's good enough,"It's the best wireless controller for the PS2. However, comparing to the wired stock controller, it is still not good enough, especially in action intensive game, i.e. God of War 2. I keep experiencing a small lag with the double jump which is not happening with the stock wired controller. So now I mainly use this controller for slow pace games like RPG games. Bottom line is if you really need a wireless controller then go for it, just don't expect that it will be a good replacement for the stock controller."
1,Logitech PS2 controller can't take the punishment of the original dual shock ps2,"I bought this controller--I actually own two of them, one for my U.S. PS2 and the other for my Japanese PS2--and the one I used for my US PS2 stopped working properly after just a few months. It happened after playing Kingdom Heart II for a second time. The X button started to get stuck (sunk all the way in) when I needed it the most. This X button is now useless, for it does not longer spring back when you push it down. It stays down.I have been playing games PS1, PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube, and I have never seen a controller behaving so badly after just a few usages.I will not and cannot recommend this wireless at all. Now I need to replace it, but I can't find any other brand or company which will satisfy me.I am glad that Sony itself will deliver a new controller (not the bumerang controller) ,which is wireless for the PS3. I think that even the wireless Xbox 360 controller is better than this junk."
2,Great Controller but doesn't last,"This controller, in the beginning is great. Good range, works perfectly. I have had it 2 years, but do not use it often - I'm actually still on my first set of batteries. Now the X button sticks in and does not pop back out properly when released, and it makes it really hard to use. After researching, found that this is a common problem, and cannot be fixed. Bottom line - its a great controller but will not last long - it's a shame."
3,x button sticking,the controller is great except that the x button is sticking after a month of use. i play about 10 hours a week max.
4,Quality Product,"Despite it's appearance, the disc surface is actually flat. Thankfully there are no indentions as it appears in the photo.Flies straight, and far. Took a little time to get used to the slightly deeper than usual lip on this disc, but onceyou get the hang of it this is a great product. If anything it moves a little too quickly, actually burst a blood vesselin my hand with this on a particularly hard throw. Nearly unaffected by wind under 10mph. Nice Disc, would recommend!"
1,AGREE,"I absolutely agree with the previous reviewers,specially with Mr.Cahill.This DVD is pathetic and why would someone watch it or go see the production at the opera house is beyond my reckoning...I would love to see his list of ""banned"" stage directors,since I likewisehave one and we probably coinicide.If you want to appreciate GENOVEVA get the audio MASUR set on BERLIN CLASSICS,.That is ""THE GENOVEVA.""Fernando Funes"
2,Disappointed,"The Opera books I have don't mention this opera, so I was curious and expected something! I was disappointed, the music is nice and some parts are quite interesting, but not very much excitement. On top of that, the staging of a non-so-great libretto is obscure (even in a bright white cube) and over-sophisticated. No wonder that many revival attempts of this opera have failed. I still think that with the right staging it could have some merit, or at least become a pleasant opera to listen and watch, but it is certainly not the case of this DVD. The only reason to purchase this DVD is for the ""real"" curious opera fun who wants to see one that will probably not be recorded often."
1,Not for children,This book is a direct transalation with no attempt to make it accessible for young readers.
5,great!!!,"Just what I was looking for, and for a good price! Shipped fast and the pattern is very pretty and goes well with the rest of the set I have."
4,Good Read,"A woman's journal & letters home from her WWII days as a WAC (Women's Army Corp). The training was intense and extensive -- much more than I would have expected. Was also surprised at the variety of work done by women (including airplane mechanics). Lots of little tidbits that give insight into the experience of women in the army at that time. The author trained at Fort Oglethorpe (my hometown), which was one of the larger WAC training centers. Very interesting to read about the tension between the southern and northern girls at the camp. The book is an easy read -- not real deep or reflective, but lots of fun details and adds to the picture of what life was like training for a war."
5,Love this pan,I have already used this pan three times and love it.. I cleans right up. a little difficult to get the cake out of the corners but the quality is great!
3,Another solid indie slasher,"Much like Bloody murder, Shredder and Plasterhead we have another low budget slasher. This time it's a winter setting at a cabin where teens are being maimed by a hooded killer with an axe.I won't go too much into this, but don't expect a masterpiece. It's a cliche slasher film with a good amount of t and a. I thought it was solid comparatively speaking... it's really well shot with some pretty well done gore. I'd really suggest this for fans of the aforementioned films."
3,"A Bargain, but...","Homedics offers memory pillows at a really competitive price for sure. As you look through Amazon.com's listings for them here, you might find that this is the least expensive.However, they do not last as long as they should. Bringing up a great question: how long should a pillow last? My hope would be that a pillow would last at least a year. My Homedics pillow lasted just that - a year. I then had to replace it because it got Alzheimers: it went flat and forgot to re-inflate.It left me to wonder whether other memory pillows would last longer than this brand."
5,"Great, unique, funny, wise; how do I get a copy?","This is a truly unique book. The author has a great understanding of the way a kid thinks. The main character is a young boy who is crowned king. He has various adventures as he learns about the world of grownups: going to war, starting a parliament for kids, traveling, etc. My only regret is that I read a library copy and I want to own my own but it is out of print."
5,This Book is Very Funny,"King Matt the First is a very good book about how a king does his work. Once King Matt, who is 10 years old, snuck away to join the army even when he wasn't supposed to. I recommend this book to everybody because it is very exciting and each chapter ends as a cliffhanger."
2,Not very pleased,I own a CD projects cd case that I purchased years ago so I went with something I loved. The case itself is pretty nice but the inside where you put the cds is laughable. The only reason I'm keeping it is b/c I don't want to pay the 15% re-stocking fee they want. I would not recommend this product at all.
3,Tangible and Intangible,"As I was once a prospective PH.D. candidate, I can defnitely appreciate the quality and painstaking research that went into this finely written scholarly work. However, having been coached by a very fine Jungian psychologist, Dr. H. Skipton Leonard, PH.D., I find this book more a history of psychological thought than an in-depth study of Jung and ensuing practical applications."
4,A somewhat difficult but enlightening presentation.,"This book is a somewhat difficult but enlightening comparison of navaho and tibetan world views. Mr. Gold bounces back and forth between these two views and gives a taste but does not always deliver the whole dish. His desire to unite these two worldviews frequently does not do justice to his navaho material and ends up a times confusing. I did enjoy the book for its appendices, often finding them more informative than the text. I would like to see this author write a more through book on navaho worldview. He appears to know more and understand more than he shares in this book."
1,Not for my cat,My cat doesn't like this. its been sitting on the floor for 2 weeks and she hasn't used it. I'll leave it out but it doesn't look good.
5,review 1,My husband has been using Paul Sebastian for years. We are thankful to be able to buy it on Amazon
4,Important Information,"I can't help but rate the product 4 stars because it is an excellent value if you like Paul Sebastian...however either I was in a rush and didn't notice that this isn't a spray bottle or the product description didn't mention it. So, if you need a spray bottle don't get this one. Additionally, I also discovered that Amazon won't process a return for cologne because it is a flammable item."
3,Product Not As Advertised,"When I purchased the Ps Cologne it said it was an 8oz. SPRAY bottle, but when the product arrived, it was not in spray form. When i notified the shipper, I was told that the ad on Amazon.com was wrong that it wasn't a spray bottle and that they would contact amazon.com to correct the ad mistake. The ad still hasn't been changed. They did offer me a refund but I told them I would keep the cologne. The cologne is a great product at a great price and it arrived in a timely fashion. My only complaint was that I prefer the advertised spray bottle."
1,Probably not genuine PS,"I've bought the 4oz spray (at another Amazon address, not this page) in the past, and it was genuine PS. I came across this 8oz. version, and thought for the price I just had to order it ($24.45 for 8oz?). Should have realized it was too good to be true. First, while the page says it's a spray, it became a ""splash"" once it got into my cart, which I never noticed (who would?). So, I didn't get a spray. Secondly, it just didn't smell like PS. I've been using it for over 25 years, exclusively. So I think I know the product. This one was just not right. Box was not sealed, neither was bottle. Not that that means anything, since there are plenty of legitimate reasons why there might not be any shrink-wrap, or other such seals, and still be legal. But the smell is off. I don't know if it was watered down, adulterated, or spoiled (is that possible?). In any event, probably best to avoid this 8oz. version, at least in my opinion."
3,a nice addition,Fr. Groenings wrote the Passion of Jesus and It's Hidden Meaning with the intention of taking his material directly from the Bible with no mention of any private revelations and to emphasize that every single detail of the Passion happend for a reason and had a deeper meaning. For the most part the book succeeds. His discussion of Judas and Caiaphus is particularly good. If I was going to buy only one book on the Passion this would not be it because I can think of several that are better but it is a nice addition to your collection if you are especially devoted to meditating and studying Our Lord's Passion.
1,Key charts and graphics are illegible in the Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition of this book is crippled as the key charts and graphics, including the complex graphic supporting the Service Profit Chain, are essentially unreadable on either the Kindle device or the iPad. The graphics look like very (very!) low resolution scans, with low contrast, and about 3pt type. I assume the publisher is responsible for the quality of the translation to the ebook format. For this type of book, where visual models are a critical part of the content, the poor quality is simply inexcusable."
3,"An important and valuable book, but:","The multiple examples that use about 50% of the book's volumes are lengthy, tedious and at times redundant. This book would have been as valuable if it occupied half the number of pages. Also, whoever edited the book needs to know that 'insure' is the act of providing insurance, whereas 'ensure' is the act of verifying or 'making sure'."
3,3 Stars For Nostagia,"The plots and productions values are not very good, but Michael Rennie is always worth watching."
1,Annoying On-Screen Logos,"When I watch something on TV I expect to see logos all over the place. I do not expect it when I buy DVD's. These disks have the logo on ALL THE TIME, except for the closing credits. For me, Timeless Media Group now join Platinum as two companies from which I will never again purchase DVD's.It's one thing for a first-run movie, but for a 50+ year old TV series, Give me a break!"
4,A Nostalgic Series,I remember this series from my youth. The acting and production are dated but it's a show worth watching. The quality of the DVD transfer is what one would expect for a TV show filmed in the 1950s. The set was worth the $8 and now I have it in my DVD collection.
1,"Misleading description, this is the TV version, NOT the movie!","I am wondering why there is no mention in the product description that this is the TELEVISION version of The Third Man with Michael Rennie and NOT the movie with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten as the wonderful review above this describes.Unfortunately, Amazon hasn't put a system of checks and balances in place to keep this type of misleading practice from happening."
4,Pretty decent album from Bai Bang,"With Bai Bang's second album ""Cop To Con"", the guys from Sweden changed their sound to a more straight-ahead party rock vibe. While it's not essential by any stretch of the imagination, it is still worth picking up for some good cheese metal anthems.Bai Bang seem like the Swedish version of Poison or early Warrant. Mind you that these guys are not Jani Lane or Brett Michaels, they still have that pop metal sound down pretty pat. Calling this album metal may be blasphemous to some, but hey, it was the early 90's. Just about every song on this record is listenable, and no song really sticks out as filler to me. I really liked ""Cop To Con"", ""Run To The End"" and ""Adrenaline"", but like I said, every song is good.Even though I don't consider this essential, if you like 80's style pop metal you should give this album a shot."
2,Did not work,Don't bother with this product. This product did nothing to repel fleas from my dog. It was a waste of money. Maybe it works on humans but I had read that it worked on animals also and was desperate for a remedy.
5,Impressive!,"A friend kept raving about these and I had to check them out. I was skeptical of his claim that they sounded almost as good as his home stereo speakers but cost only $60. So I tried them out thinking I was going to run them back to the store the same day. But he was right. These have crisp highs, a decent midrange, and tight and booming bass for small desktop speakers. I had to lower the base in my computer properties because it was too much base at first. I have no idea how these speakers can do that without a subwoofer. I listened to them using several classical scores and found they sound better than the 2.1 Bose system on my other computer. And these were much cheaper. I have had them for a while now and am still impressed."
1,Not Good!!,This Log Splitter was weak at best. It struggled with the smallest logs and would not split the larger logs. I returned it. Which Amozon was good about!!
1,Cheap Bedding,"I picked this pattern because my son loves stars, moons, and rockets. However when the comforter arrived, it was very cheap feeling, and paper thin. I wound up returning it because it was so thin and scratchy feelng."
5,Only reason I passed physics,"Im absolutely horrible at physics. This book is the only reason why I actually made a C+ in my college course. It isnt the most indepth book for college physics, but it is excellent for understanding basic concepts for general physics. I used this book for understanding and used my textbook to work more difficult problems."
1,"Silly triller, poorly researched and written","Dr. Seacourt, who the author calls the ""thinking man's James Bond"" is sort of a buffoon. How many working physicians take months away from their practice to take a course in Russia. This clown doesn't seem to know as much about AIDS as one could find in a Time magazine, nevermind an actual medical journal. The plot is contrived. The author did not research his locales(for example, the St. Louis zoo in nowhere near the best zoo in the world; Imo's Pizza in St. Louis is pizza fast food, not ""a fine Italian restaurant"" and Boone's Lick, MO is NOT in the Ozarks). The author also needs to cut down on his use of similes. Once in a while is fine(for a good author), but four or five in a row, especially as contrived examples as are used in this story, leaves the reader laughing at the story, not with it."
2,"Decent book, but had its shortcomings.","After Davis's previous book, The Plutonium Murders, became one of my all time favorites, I expected a bit more. I found plot of The Doomsday Kiss to be excessively complicated, and the book was so layered with scientific jargon that a true understanding of the plot was difficult to obtain. However, I did find the close escapes of Dr. Seacourt and the international espionage to be fascinating. Were this turned into a movie, I would not hesitate to go see it.And the grammar, I might add, was far better than in The Plutonium Murders. I noticed few mistakes in this book. Those few are forgivable, for to err is human."
1,Hard to believe ANYONE Would give this book any star!,"A thinking, well read person would be insulted an author would try to sell anyone this book. The grammer is as bad as the first book written by this author. As for the reviews listing possible actors interested in participating in a movie, do the actor's know their names are being used? Mr. Davis, don't give up your day job, whatever that is, because as an author you need some creative writing classes!"
1,Save your Money,"Perhaps I am wrong, I have been wrong before and will be wrong again, but it is my opinion that it would be better to save your money and not spend it on this book. Unless the good Doctor starts writing better I think he will not go beyond one more book, grammar and english do matter."
5,NISHIKAWA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^.~,"Finally! T.M.Revolution's new CD! I had been waiting for it for awhile. Actually, I actually was just anxious right after I found out there was going to be a new one. I absolutly LOVE T.M.R and i have both DVDs (Sonic Warp; Summer Crush), Coordinate, and SEVENTH HEAVEN. He actually steps outside his norm and sang a couple songs in English on this CD, one of which happens to be my favourite song on the CD: Web of Night (track 5), but i think there's at least two more in English as well. Also, it came with a DVD consisting of a concert performance of Albiero from SEVENTH HEAVEN. Yes that's right. Just one song on the DVD, but i still think that it was worth it because i can't get enough of him. ^.~"
4,Summer Wine tastes Good,"I enjoyed this single. I thought it was very interesting that Ville Valo would do a Lee Hazelwood song. Lee Hazelwood, if you don't know him, was famous for the Nancy Sinatra hit ""Boots"". Ville with his low voice almost sounds like Johnny Cash with this style of music. If you are a big HIM fan this is a must for all collectors."
2,good???,"I like the speed and short time that it tokes for the book to arrive. The book is in good shape, just NOT the edition that is advertise under, it was the first edition, NOT the second, which I wanted."
4,Soothing AND interesting,"I received this as a gift when my second son was born. I never played music for my older child at bed time, but my little one needs some calm-down time before bed. This CD is great because it is unlike all those othe cheesy lullaby CDs that you don't want to hear. It helps my 18 month son relax and get into sleep mode. It's great for the car as well since music is very soothing, yet interesting for adults to listen to. I find myself humming the first song, Naima throughout the day."
2,very mellow,"we didn't love this album as much as latin playground and others. it is a lullaby cd, we know, but it was way too mellow for us."
3,More exciting than lullabies,"This CD is nice with a lot of good tracks. Some of the tunes definitely fit the bill as soothing lullabies, but others are much to exciting. For example, Santana shreds in a solo on the first track. Cool? Yes. Lulling my baby to sleep? Not exactly. Will still play it and it makes a good relaxing time soundtrack, so overall I am happy, but I count think I would've ordered it had I been able to hear it first."
4,Buy this book now!,This is a fast paced and exciting read. Lots of gore and tension - very hard to put down! My advice is go out and buy this book TODAY! Or better still just order it online from Amazon!
2,BORING!,"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....what more is there to say! Perhaps there are more interesting books on the subject. If so, please let me know."
4,a classic HR title,"This a reference book that HR professionals should add to their professional bookshelf. If you are a manager or graduate student, this book is invaluable."
5,7 thumbs up!,"Excellent service, fast shipping, product in better than advertised condition, I would use these guys again, given half a chance. DVD is outstanding, too. A good juxtaposition of ""jamband"", and more mainstream artist."
5,So FINE!,"Four BEAUTIFUL little short stories that teach about the powers of perception that we all have in us. We are wonderful perceiving and discriminating beings. Our powers have been stifled. Covered up. Undeveloped. And their lack of development gives power to the power elite, who revel in our helplessness and make us pay with our lives and our freedom. These little stories are for all ages. They tell us how to discover, utilize and handle our innate abilites. They help us to understand and still love those who fear it in us. We can revel in our wonderousness. Read them to your children. Read them over and over. Almost too beautiful to bear."
4,sanitizer,"It is portable which is nice, easy to use however I always wonder in general...is it really getting sanitized? The light comes on and the turns off when it is done ""sanitizing"". We bought one for the daycare center too. It uses batteries so no need to find power. Also taking it camping with us."
5,Good Product,"It's easy to install (comes with a cd) Very versatile and compatible with a variety of programs and has great range. I am 17, going to college and i wanted it so that i could change tracks or pause movies etc. instead of sitting right next to my pc.Works great with both desktop and laptop!"
4,Works exceptionally well with Myth TV,"If I'm not mistaken, the developers of Myth TV use this remote. It was recognized and configured with no problems. I did have to customize some buttons, but it was a simple modification to the .liirc file. The only complaint I have about this remote is that the clip on the battery cover ended up breaking. This is partially my fault as I fidget with clips, but it's a bit flimsy to begin with."
1,Does not work with 64bit system,"Does not work well with 64bit system, and the company does not give support. Keeps crashing the computer, Known problem with no fixes."
1,does not work with wintv,"I just realized I've wasted twenty bucks since this remote control does not work with WinTV, which is the solid reason I bought this remote. It is useless, and I can't even return it since I opened the case already."
3,64bit beta driver available (link in comments),"Word of warning: this will not work with 64bit Windows. This remote is useless to me now that I've upgraded, at least until they get around to releasing a proper driver. Which they should have done months ago, considering how long 64bit Windows Vista and Win7 have been around.UPDATE: after contacting Streamzap support, they provided me with a link to a beta x64 driver, with clear-but-complicated instructions on how to install it:[...]It seems to work, so I'm upgrading my review from two stars to three. I will give them a higher rating if/when they release a ready-for-primetime x64 driver with an actual installer, because when this remote works, it works quite well."
3,Needs 64 bit driver,"In order to use this I had to fire up my 32-bit virtual machine on my WIN7 64-bit OS. It seems to work fine, but, 64 bit would save what I have to go through in order to use it. Purchased it to use when presenting a large power point."
3,....and i thought i was disfunctional!,"a rather interesting bio. pretty much the whole book is half bio and half satire and commentary. it definitly give's you a tour into the demented mind of howard stern and as you progress through the book even as raunchy as it get's you finish by saying to yourself ""well that made sense""not for the uptight and not for the easily offended,,,read with an open mind!"
3,Farcical and ridiculous and certainly no tribute to hardship,"I had to toss the book halfway through and turn on the Jerry Springer show for some real dysfunctional excitement. Stern's (or his ghost writer's attempt) to portray some sort of adversity this man had to encounter in his life is ridiculous. It strokes a man who plays to the masses not in the form of his altitudenous insight, but rather to forms of dysfunction, perversion and an obtrusion into clear and sexually uncluttered thinking. I find this man to be interesting and somewhat likable, but his expertise appears to be coupled in radio and film, not the literary arena he thinks is so deserving of his presence. Howard, if you need to write, take a stab at something that changes thinking, not about how many times a day you have to change your soiled underwear."
5,The King of All Media shares all,"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It provides an insight to the man, the myth, the legend, Howard Stern. It is downright hilarious! A must for any fan of the show!!!"
4,"Great Book, Great Story. Yes he is crazy yet ""read it""","The old expression goes. If you dont like him you will listen, watch or read it anyway so you could know what he will say next. Howard is a crazy yet true to life guy who will thrill you with his life story. You pitty him, you love him, you laugh at and with him, you want to cry and you want to die. Why not read it or at least see the movie. You will appriciate him as an every day guy who just had the guts to do what we all wanted to do yet wouldnt. READ IT TODAY!"
5,Stern is the KING of all media,"If you have ever listened to Howard Stern, love him orhate him, this book is necessary reading. Stern writes about his various antics which caught some hefty fines by the FCC, his short run TV show and other life events. It really is a fun read"
3,REALLY A 2 MOVIE QUADROLOGY,"Love the extras on this set as well as the idea of finally having a decent copy of II, since the previous release throughly stunk, still, the world would be at least a little better place if III and IV had never been made. The comedy in III is just awful but at least the special effects were decent which can't be said for IV. Who ever allowed Golan and Globus to be associated with an icon such as Superman deserves to watch this last movie over and over, in eternity.I and II were so good that after their release I thought the series could last as long as James Bond. Thanks to III and IV, I was off by only about a dozen films !"
3,Weller quality has really gone downhill since the last time I've bought their tools,"The construction quality of this product is fair at best. The connector for the soldering iron on the front of the base unit isn't anchored in its place, and I can already tell this will be the first thing I ever have to fix on this unit. Operationally... it doesn't seem to get as hot as the display says it is, but I'll have to confirm this with later testing. I had also bought two other Weller soldering guns (140/100W and 260/200W) along with this order and they too are poorly built compared to my older Weller tools. It's a shame."
1,Poor Quality,"I am extremely disappointed in this mask. For that kind of money, I expected better quality. It is just a rubber mask like what you would find in a drugstore for under $20 and mine had a large, highly visible line across the middle of it from where the mold was poorly processed. It does not look like the picture. The vendor does not allow returns. I'll not waste my money with this vendor in the future."
4,Want to breathe fire?,Then purchase this mask! It's a costume that's cool for older teens and adults.
2,Worked great for 5 months,"The scale was fantastic for 5 months. Then (right after I finally threw away all the original packaging) it went out of calibration and will not calibrate. We tried many times, following the simple instructions carefully. No good. Looks like it's time for a new scale..."
2,twin window fan,"I have been looking for a fan for my basement window. Just could not find the right size. This was the perfect size. It was very difficult to lock the extension panel. They just wouldn't hold. Then finally it fell out of the window because it woudn't hold and the lock clip broke. Would not buy this again, due to the locking clip. needs to be redesigned."
2,not the best one,This one works fine. But poor quality. Side extended pieces are very thin and lock even broke from one side when I get it.....not recommend .....try different one....
3,Loud for the power,"The fan seems sturdy and pretty well made. The extendable side and side panel are a nice touch to help direct airflow. The fan itself works pretty well, it is just loud for the amount of power and airflow it produces."
2,little smaller than what was described,"Great fan works well but doesn't fit in my window. The description says fits 36"" windows is a lie. Its only 33"" total at max!!!"
2,Dead after 8 months.,"I used this in my kitchen to fan the air out while cooking. The fan is used an average of 3 times a week for about 2 hours each time. So, we didn't even use the unit non stop for a whole summer or anything. Yet, it stopped working in less than 8 months of easy usage. We never left it out in the rain, or using it while it's raining out (as that could possibly let water seeped into the motor).As far as its peformance, I had no complaints. It aired out my little kitchen as I expected from its size. It's light enough that it's easy to remove from the kitchen window after I'm done using it.So, for its size, I think it performed as expected. Too bad it didn't last long at all."
1,broke in three uses.,"It broke almost immediately. As witness to my frustration over the crappy quality of goods lately, my boyfriend kindly volunteered to fix it. It's been six weeks and he hasn't, but I'm also not going to waste my time shipping it back for a return. Harumph."
2,Cheap in both price and quality,"Pro- About the cheapest window fan you can get with known brand name.Con-1. To me the ""Two quiet speed settings"" is false advertisement. IMO, the fans are loud but doesn't move as much air2. No timer. So if you have this on at night, you'll have to get up and turn it off3. ""manually reversible""4. The fitting is too short for me even with the extender panel5. You can tell the material used were cheapBottom line-You get what you paid for. I personally would recommend anybody who's looking into window fans to put in some extra dollars for a better one."
3,Narrower than advertised,"The specs say this will fit a 36"" opening, but the reality is that over 33.25 inches you will need to buy the accessory extender.The power cord is longer than represented by some reviewers. Mine are 6 feet long but factor in that the cord connects to the bottom center of the fan enclosure.My windows are vinyl double-hung with insulated glass and so are thicker than Holmes allowed for and the bottom sash of the window does not capture the top of the fan as intended. You really will want to have screens on your windows to make up for the loose fit.My two are doing the job of lowering the humidity in a rarely-occupied lower level living area."
2,Half a fan,"Only one of the 2 fans actually worked when I got this product. Normally I would have returned it but for what I needed, the twin fan set up was overkill so I guess it worked out. However, I certainly would hesitate to buy this fan again."
2,moves air doen't fit,"<...>prosmoves air and cools roommissing parts free from manufacturernot very expensivefree shippingconssupposed to fit window up to 36"" but does NoT come with extention panelshave to call the company and they est 5-8 business daysLOUD even on low settingcan not run just one fan"
5,Great little fan,"I bought this fan at the end of May, and it has been running almost 24/7 since then. It is quiet and circulates the air very well in my small room. As of today, I have not shut it off for about 10 days straight, and it shows on sign of overuse. The only thing that would make it a perfect purchase would be if it had a reverse switch. Taking it out of the window and putting it in backwards is a bit of a pain. Asice from that minor quibble, however, I reccommend this fan to anyone who needs a small to medium space cooled."
3,Good item for the price,The fan is a very basic model.Pros- Easy to install and comes with a side panel to block the window opening- Cheap- Can be used for venting as well as getting air inCons- A little noisy for the air that it pushes through (relatively low CFM for the noise level)- Twin fans cannot be controlled independently- Venting or getting air in is controlled manually by reversing the fan.
3,Incorrect dimensions provided,"The product description says this fan accommodates a window up to 36"" wide. This is not true. The actual product accommodates windows up to 33.25"" wide. This is confirmed in the product manual. It can be made to accommodate larger windows but this requires purchase of additional extender panels from the manufacturer, for $5 + shipping for each 4.25"" extender panel"
2,Noisy,This is a very noisy fan to be so little. I have it upstairs and it sounds like the goodyear blimp over the house.
3,"""manual"" reverse direction misleading","I bought this thinking that you could switch the fans from intake to exhaust via a switch on the fan. Not the case, you have to take it out of the window and turn it around- that is what ""manual"" means in the description. Otherwise it works fine, agree with others, a little loud."
2,Birds don't like it.,"I have several bird feeders and have used several kinds of suet cakes, the woodpeckers in my yard would finish a suet cake in about five days, I have had two of these in my yard for over two weeks, the woodpeckers take one peck and leave. In fact I have seen the woodpeckers spend more time at my bird seed feeders. Even the squirrels wound eat them."
5,Great,The item that I received were exactly what I had issued in the military. I am glad that I am glad that I found these as I had lost the ones from my unit. The seller was very quick and exactly what I expected. Thank you.
2,"1st try, not too impressed","This is my first time setting up dust collection for my shop. I bought these thinking they would be a great time saving tool. I spend more time trying to get them to close all the way than if I carried around a hose from tool to tool. They are sticky when closing, they get chips in the grooves that you have to dig out. A pain. Am going to look at the metal ones and give them a try."
4,Wife liked it!,"Got these for my wife for Valentines day. While I'm not a big fan (at all) of dark chocolate, my wife loved it so 'nuff said!"
2,Fell Apart.,"The content was good, at least for the first 1/3, until the binding broke and the book started losing pages. For the price, one would hope the book would last through at least one reading and not fall apart like some cheap paperback."
1,"Confused, poorly organized rehash of Dolley Madison's life","This was one of the worst biographies I have ever read. I found no new information about Mrs. Madison, and the information that was rehashed was terribly organized for a disruptive reading experience. Over and over again the author jumps from topic to topic, interupting what seems like it could be an interesting arguement or point with some unrelated piece of information that destroys the rhythm of the thought. The information on the complex relationships within the Payne and Madison families is written out rather than expressed in a family tree and is nearly useless. Photographs are sprinkled throughout the book [...] but the captions are all at the end of the book. I found it very disruptive to have to turn to the back to find out what I was looking at and what the significance of the photo might be. Very, very disappointing."
1,BUYER BEWARE: A poor choice (especially for students researching Dolley Madison),"I authored a paper on Dolley Madison in April 2012 for an Early Republic American history class. I initially intended to use Cote's book as one of my sources for the paper. However, thankfully I was given a head's up and learned that there are other sources out there that are far more accurate than what Cote produced about Dolley. I prefer to read and use books that are written by historians, those who have Phd's in history. Cote has a B.A. in political science and journalism. He also uses A LOT of secondary sources in his bibliography. To me, this is a red flag, especially when there are an abundance of primary sources on Dolley. I think Catherine Allgor's book ""A Perfect Union"" is a great suggestion for those who are seriously interested in learning about Dolley."
5,Amazing book. Great confidence booster!,(1) Parent's are the best people to discuss intimate topics with children.(2) This book is the best 'how-to' as far as teaching how to hold these types of conversations.(3) Great price and shipping via Amazon.
1,Pre -the Hollywood version,not a fan at all of the Hollywood cariacatures of Pre. this one is the worse of the two in my view.
2,Moronic Wilkins and Sex...that's about it,"I am amazed that anyone could consider this a good film. You see, when I go to a movie I don't need to know the size of a man's private part coupled with my Christian faith. Secondly, Mac Wilkins is portrayed as a hulking moron. Is it not safe to assume that producers/writers of this film have yet to graduate from Junior High? This is obviously their level of development. Rent ""Prefontaine"" with Jared Leto. Respect the memory of the Coos Bay native with a film worthy of his memory. GO PRE! To the writers of ""Without Limits"" > GO AWAY!"
5,Comes in Real Handy,"Bought this for my trip to Israel and it is a very good convience. Not only does it hold my DVD player but it also holds up to 15 DVD'S and has a velcro pocket that was able to hold my earphones, keys, among other things. There's one more zipper that was able to hold my passport, ticket, phone and money.It has an adjustable shoulder strap but if you don't want to put it over your shoulder you can hold it in your hand with the firm handle. I bought this for $10 and it is worth every penny."
2,From a fellow student of prophecy,"On the plus side, this book is very well organized and is easy to read and understand. It goes through major sections of Daniel and then proceeds to Revelation.However, the author fails to explain key points in some of his more controversial interpretations. For example, one of his first statements is that the time, times, and half a time is equal to 3,278 years. As this is not an interpretation that I have seen before for this particular item, I would very much like to know how he come up with that number.This is a pattern that I find throughout the book: the author makes a number of interpretations without backing them up. While this is not a bad description of what one person believes the book of Revelation, if you are looking for an indepth study on prophecy, look elsewhere."
4,i like it,have a terrier that howls when baby is crying . this color solved it. we did the beep as a warning and then #1 spray and after 2 times he didn't do it. HOWEVER the battery runs out quickly. so get extra battery at store 6V I think.
2,Cross your fingers it doesn't break,"My AVR 2807 stopped working properly a few months after I bought it. The HDMI up conversion just stopped working. No big deal, I thought. It has been two months now and I'm still without my receiver.I took it to one of Denon's ""Super Service Centers."" It sat there for over a month. By that time I was finally able to convince a customer service rep at Denon to send me a replacement unit because they could not repair my original unit. Two weeks later, they are still giving me the run around. No one answers the phone or returns messages. Bottom line, if you need to buy a Denon get it from a place where you can return it if it breaks. Denon is useless. I've never had this much trouble getting something repaired by a manufacturer. I'm disappointed the AVR 2807 stopped working after 4 months and I'm very disappointed with how Denon conducts its warranty repairs."
1,Can't run it.,"This is not a bad unit, just difficult to operate. Audiophiles pass on, this is not for you. 20 years ago I would have loved this unit. Today I don't want to have to study owners manuals for two weeks, OK? This is a complicated piece of equipment, and if you don't want to go to school to learn how to use it, it will be the audio/video hell you've never imagined existed. I do not believe it's Denon, but any new sophisticated audio/vidio equipment. I don't blame Denon, I'm just disappointed someone can't build better simplicity for us baby boomers who have outgrown owners manuals. This system is integral to the operation of all of your audio/video equipment. I get the system working, and my wife, who can barely operate a car, has it all day, and I come home to no sound, no DVD, no you pick it. I don't blame Denon, I blame myself for buying it in the first place. This system is a great bargain for audiophiles, a disaster for pilgrams."
1,Defective too!,"Me too - defective bluray, I got it to play one time but have tried many times since and it won't work. Locks up my player and I have to disconnect the power from the player just to eject! Not sure if the non bluray would work any better."
3,AUDIO DEFECT,"I thought my system (left speaker was not working). I check my audio set-up, only to find that it was the DVD that was recorded faulty. However, nice show, video was good. With today advance tech. this should should have been a top rated production."
1,Lionel Richie Live in Paris,"I saw it on TV and loved it ,,,but then I came online to buy it and found out that DVD is defective! I will NOT bother to buy a defective product. Too bad... what a Record Company!!"
3,Good journeyman mystery,"This is my first Emerson mystery. Recently moved to WA State, so am very interested in local places depicted in the book. Strong plot with great tie-in to a (fictitious) old murder. This isn't Elizabeth George but is just as readable as Sue Grafton and the detection holds together. Light, enjoyable, enterprising PI story--"
2,Trite,"One thing that your average self-absorbed modern writer can't seem to grasp is that people can actually be motivated by spiritual and religious devotion. There is a vogue for pretending women saints of the past were secretly dismissive of orthodoxy, and were really closet feminists or Gnostics or sybarites or whatever happens to capture the author's imagination. Yawn. This is just another one of those. I truly wish I had a dollar for every time I heard someone assert that Mary Magdalen or Hildegarde or Teresa was secretly a rebel against the established religious beliefs of her day. The fact that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for these fantasies doesn't seem to stop people from having them.What would really be interesting to read is a book that takes those women for who they actually were: passionate, driven, and orthodox to the core. Hard to fathom, yes, but why not give the truth a whirl?"
1,Zzzzzzzzzz.......,Impossible saints? Impossible to read. The wonder is that people will actually part with good money for this dross. Be warned!
1,"Buyer beware: crackle, hiss, and distortion","Buyer beware! The Arista Albums cds have been transferred from vinyl record albums to compact disc. The great dynamic and frequency ranges afforded to the listener by the compact disc are not utilized to their potentials with this release; I am sorry to inform you. The reasons for the unavailability of the original masters is understandable. My guess is that Sony/BMG allowed the license to Acadia Music and a second rate job to transpire so that it could gain an easy profit: no need to undergo a proper job when a Mickey Mouse job will pay the bills.That being said, if you have never heard the music on the cds, I recommend hearing it in some form: through LPs or these CDs. Just remember a crude, yet true axiom: You can't polish a turd. Transferring sound from an LP to a CD does not make the music sound any better. Transferring sound from master or multitrack tapes does offer better dynamic range and frequency range than an LP, however."
3,"Lord Leighton, an approach","It is a good first approach to this great painter, good images, good size, recommendable as an approach"
3,"Good, but not too good","This product does what it sets out to do, record. How well it does that is a whole nother story. In a lecture hall you have to make sure to sit at or near the front of the hall, otherwise you can barely hear the speaker over the room noise and the noise of the recorder. The recorder itself makes a good amount of noise when recording and when playing back. And when the machine gets cold or has been used a bit, it likes to make a high pitched squel that is very disruptive in lectures. Not the best choice ever."
3,yikes!,I bought this planner so I could listen to books on tape when I am walking. There is no clip on it so unless you hold it in your hand it isn't usable for that purpose.
1,Poor purchase,"I bought this product with high hopes...It never worked. There was absolutely no volume. I returned it. I've never had to return anything before purchased on Amazon, so this was a huge disapointment."
2,Monaural only,"I expected that it would only record in monaural (after all, there's only one microphone and speaker), but I didn't expect that the headphone outlet would be monaural only. So, you can't listen to pre-recorded tapes in stereo, only monaural."
5,Great recorder!,Small but powerful. Love using it to record my Aquasize class when I am on vacation. No one wants to lead the class when I go on a trip so I just made a recording of it and they use that. The Cassette Voice recorder is portable and very clear when you record. Just love it
4,Great item for an older child.,I purchased this item for my 9 year old daughter who participates in children's theatre so that she can record important information during practices. It is very easy for her to use for both recording & playback.
1,Disappoint with the recprder,"While the recorder works, its speed does not adjust right and as a result the recording does NOT always come out right or even intelligible."
3,Suzuki Volume 1,"Well, I think the Suzuki method is over-rated. It's not all bad, but certainly gets too much hype. My daughter loves to play the Twinkle Variations, but finds it absolutely maddening that the songs are played at concert speed on the cd. For a small kid, it just builds frustration to try to keep up. It would be nice if there were Twinkle at Various Speeds on the cd - instead of just one speed: super fast."
5,Excellent,My 5 year old has been playing the Violin since she was 3. We love the method and this book.
4,Very cool beginner's book,"My violin teacher, who plays with the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra, recommended this book. When I first got it, I thought, man this is for little kids... well guess what, when it comes to the violin, I AM a little kid. I have learned a lot through her and this book. I highly recommend it!"
3,Buy Metzger and Aland before this one!!!,"If your into textual criticism, definitly get Metzger and Aland's books (both named TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT) before this one.Kind of a strange book, on one hand it give you very basic introductry info on textual criticism, then it dives into some very complex comparison/contrast of greek wording in variant readings of some of the more important witnesses (i.e. p66, p75, Aleph, B, etc.) -- You'll have to be pretty sharp in greek to make any sense of these....For your money, you're much much better off getting Metzger's and Aland's books. You will learn WAY MORE!!!I would only recommend this book to someone who has first read and enjoyed the books mentioned above. -- but even then, the buyer will be disappointed in the amount and depth of info when compared to Metzger/Aland.Recomendation: Save your money, there are so many other great books to buy ahead of this one.Eric"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Using the approach of an economics business model, John Kay defines the major characteristics firms have used to succeed where others fail. To get on the right side of that fence, he says, work your corporate strengths. Kay maintains that success hinges on distinctive abilities a firm can muster to add value for its particular customers. These unique traits include skills, reputation, and relationships. While the book (and the reader) may choke a bit on the academic charts and examples, real meat is hidden here. On the plus side, Kay writes in a fairly clear, spare style that makes complex ideas easy to follow. On the minus side, he repeats the same basic principles and ideas. While executives might glean some real support for developing their companies' strengths, we [...] recommend his book primarily to business school academics and to those top-level managers interested in studying and applying theoretical models."
5,Not Just For Bird Owners!,"I picked up this book because of its dazzling cover and started thumbing through it. I'm an animal lover, but I've not lived with a bird since I was in grade school. Nevertheless, I was enchanted. This little - small format, only 149 pages - book caught my attention and held it so tightly that I bought it!It's a quick read for ANY animal lover...even one who loves only the human animal. I bet you'll learn a lot about relating to all creatures great and small!"
1,Size/Product Misrepresentation!,"This product simply does not run true to size, and it's listed as a mini dress. It's a piece of lingerie, it's not a dress. I ordered it in a XL. I could fit the ""mini dress"" but it only came down to my waist. The matching under garments were not even adult human size, but only large enough to fit a stuffed animal. I was honestly shocked that the seller opted to sell this item...BUYER BEWARE!"
3,Not great,"I've used nice puzzle mats before and this just doesn't comapre. But, it is cheap. I'll spend more to get a better one. The mat itself isn't very heavy. It comes folded and wrinkled so it's not a flat surface. I'm hoping it'll iron out while rolled up but I have my doubts. Just not a great puzzle mat."
2,I disagree with the comments here...,"Ok, so I bought a Sony SLV-N900 VCR a couple of weeks ago...and it is already on the way back to the company.I am not sure if I got a bad one or not, but I thought the recording quality was TERRIBLE on this VCR. It played movies and old tapes just fine, but I tried recording on both SP and SLP modes on two different new tapes, and the quality was awful each times. The colors were off and very streaky (sp?). Also had a grainy look, more than any other VCR I have ever seen. Audio quality was fine though.I will never buy a Sony VCR again...they may have been good years ago, but not anymore. My advice is to try and pick up a gently used TOSHIBA vcr (not a DVD/VCR combo) on that ""other"" site. Good luck."
1,Deffective,"As all other Sony products I have recently purchased, this VCR was found to be deffective. Remote control would not function properly. Returned to Amazon.com for refund."
5,fast service,I knew what the product was and what it cost to purchase. I ordered online as I could not locate it locally for some reason. The product was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition
5,True Thriller,The ending to this book was a shock.I liked how R. L. Stine intertwined two stories into 1 book. I deffinatly reccomend this book.
4,a smart and funny satire,"This was a great book for someone who follows politics on televison, and would like a good laugh."
3,Everything's great...except...,"My daughter recieved one of these for her birthday in October, 2004 and she's been completely delighted with it. Except for one thing - the headphones have broken twice now. They are a novel shape, designed to loop up, over the ear and come around the back of the head. The loop parts which go over the ears are hard plastic and each side has sustained a break.A repair with superglue worked the first time but not so on the second.So, I'd recommend the unit with this caveat - be careful when stowing the headphones. Don't treat them as a 14 year old might. They are not particularly rugged...thekeez"
2,Not Enough Bang for My Buck,I bought this play box for my 4-year-old granddaughter and I was really disappointed. I like the storage box - would be nice if all toys had them! But the gloves are adult size (even bigger) and the box really didn't have that much to it for the price. I'm sure the scrub gown will be torn in no time. The stuffed animals included are cheap. My granddaughter did enjoy the stethoscope and wrapping up the family's arms and legs with the bandage. I found a better veterinarian play box with more stuff and $10 cheaper through Signals that I wish I'd seen before this one. This play box was OK ... but I certainly disagree with the 5 star reviews.
4,Lots of compliments,"I bought this watch about a year ago - it has worked very well for me, and I have received numerous compliments on it. Just a couple of days ago, one of the stones fell out, and now the watch isn't working properly as an effect. But in general, I would recommend this watch."
1,buyer beware,"This product did not mount on several of our older PC's and also gave us trouble initially on our macs. 40% of its capacity was filled with software we did not need or want and most of it is impossible to remove. We managed to remove some of the unwanted programs and have most of the capacity back, but it is still a hassle to have to eject both icons when ejecting the drives from a mac. (FYI - the web site FAQ's indicate it is not mac compatible!) We did not realize that it came with all the ""extras"" when we bought them - we just wanted an empty jump drive to transfer and temporarily store data. We are more careful now to check for unwanted software when ordering flash drives."
4,Nice and Small,This USB flash drive (The SanDisk 1 GB Cruzer Micro) is also overrated like all other flash drives. It's really 973MB - 36MB because of the software include.It has a the bright red orange LED light that stay on and blinks on and off when deleting or writing files.It also has a new program called U3 smart that pop-ups when plugging in the flash drive. With this program you can add and remove files or open up the other programs include. But I don't really like it. Still like adding and removing files the old way.The retractable USB is very cool.
1,Is anyone concerned about data transfer speed?,"I use a flash drive to move my Quickbooks program from home to work and back. It is a very large file - 79 Mb's with many tens of thousands of transactions.I can tell you that the data transfer rate of the cruzer 1.0, which is what I am currently using, is so slow that it makes the program impossible to use. I basically have to download the entire file to my hard drive to do any postings, and then re-save it to the flash drive.In researching to find a faster drive, I find that only Kingston and Memorex post their data transfer rates under technical data. The rest seem to think that ""Modern slim design"" is a technical feature.I am going to order the Kingston Data Traveler as its transfer rates are 6.0 mb read, and 3.0 mb write. I really don't know if this is fast or slow, but in the absence of all the other brands leaving out this information, I am going to assume it is fast, and hope for the best."
1,"Looks great, does not work","This cookstove looks beautiful. But the hose to connect it to a propane tank does not have a standard fitting. The fitting to the stove is also not a standard fitting. We have not been able to get fittings that work. Looks great, doesn't work."
1,Never received,"I ordered this on October 2, 2010 and to date have not received it. Poor service. Have reordered with someone else."
4,Funny politics in Australia,"Meet Murray Whelan, gofer and fixer for the newly appointed Minister of Water and Arts. He has no ideas about arts, but then politics is politics, and how difficult can it be? He finds out without delay, when young artist Marcus Taylor is found floating in the moat in front of the National Gallery. Time for damage control. But then things become increasingly weird. The overpriced picture of a shadowy, and also dead, artist named Victor Szabo. Hold it! Is the picture a fake? Who painted the duplicate? How about all those suave self-made millionaires and their sudden interest in art? Mayhem erupts as everybody tries to cover up their nefarious schemes. And Murray in the thick of it, of course.The book is presented as a mystery. But that part does not come off too well with all the fun intervening. Rather, it is a send-up comedy about Australian politics and the doers behind the scenes. If you really want to laugh for a few hours, then read this book."
1,I wish I hadn't spent money on this one.,"I read this a few years ago and it was terrible. The book in general is not very well written and I had to push myself to finish it. Every so often the book veers away from the plot so the preachy heroine can go on a goody goody witch rant. She's so annoying, I wanted to reach in the book and slap her. When I did finish it, instead of giving it away or keeping it-I threw it in the trash."
5,Absolutely wonderful!!,I bought this for my granddaughter and she was beyond thrilled. It was better than I expected for the price.
4,Who Haunts Your House?,"What first attracted me was the fact that this is a true story. I can't get enough non-fiction ghost stories! I would like to say that the only reason that I gave this a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because for me the print was rather small and I found myself reading the same sentence over. I really liked how the story starts at the houses beginning history. You get to know the previous people, their lives, and their emotions that first embedded the house. A very gripping story that gets the mind wondering about your own house or apartment. A very easy read that is both interesting and gets the reader thinking. I would like to see more authors take the time to present the ""history"" of their stories. I received a complimentary copy of (The House on South Street) as a member of theDorrance Publishing Book Review Team. Visit dorrancebookstore.comto learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
4,song translations?,"This is a great CD, but the downside is that I can't understand a lot of the songs. Does anyone know where I can find translations to these songs, particularly ""mwari sigaramahoro""?"
4,"A nifty departure from the ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" norm","Hill wittily parodies both Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* and the English village mystery in this engaging romp. A nice break from the usually grim tone of the series as a whole, the novel features all the usual suspects (theft? murder? fraud?), then turns them on their heads. But at least several characters find true love where they (and we!) least expect it. Hill does delight in the odd word--""hispid,"" for example, stumped an entire room of English professors (including this one when she first encountered it!). Bibliophiles will enjoy the references to obscure Victorian novels--not to mention Enscombe's irresistibly acidic antiquarian bookseller, Edwin Digweed, who comes complete with a bookshop to drool over."
5,Fantastic!,This is full of fantastic advice from a Native American Lakota through advice of his grandfather. Everyone should read or listen to this.
3,childish,"well looking at the cover, this game looked awsome. I expected violence, drinking, drugs, uncencored swearing, and bloody. nope nope nop3 nope nope nop3. I read alot of reviews mostly looking at the ones that liking it said to people who had bad reviews to screw themselves. I knew this was a remake, but it just seems like a kids game rated e without the stuff.Multiplayer was a little hard and stuff, not really fun cuz i dont have live.dont be like me, consider this BUT we all have oppinions. some games are fun with people but witho others, hated it. So im not sure what you should do. but you shouldn't get it if you got bad fur day and you should probably rent it.im the group that thought it was pretty goodgraphics are good though"
1,On the go monitor,"My next door neighbor received a different kind of Safety 1st monitor and now we are both receiving the others baby... meaning that during the night when I think that I am getting up with my baby it turns out that I am hearing the other baby and when she thinks that she is hearing her baby it is mine. We have tried switching channels and everything, but nothing works. I have tried to find a phone number for Safety 1st but am unable to do so. If I could find the number then I would let them know what I think about their monitors."
1,Talk on their own,"When you are Catholic, you praise Catholic is in the truth. When you are Anglican, you said Catholic is wrong, mine is the truth...........so the saying goes on and on. When Christians can get united to face the demon?If Jesus Christ return, all you people are cult."
5,Mom read the potion book again,Like the other Raggedy Ann books my 6 year old daughter loved it. She went nuts the moment she saw it at the store. We sat down and read it from cover to cover. Of course we had to buy it and read again before bed. If you grew up loving these special dolls then you and your little one will love this book also.
5,Perfect,Showed up on time; and looks great; I am very happy with the purchase overall. The Vendor did a good job
5,Two Thumbs Way Way Up,"My husband and I discovered Archer two years ago and ever since then we've been avid watchers. Enjoying the show so much, we decided to buy the series and it's been worth it to be able to watch any episode we want at any time we want. My brother-in-law comes over and borrows the seasons all the time too. This is a great, funny series if you like coarse jokes and plays on pop culture I definitely suggest you buy it!"
3,Getting slowly less funny,"I love this show , but these last few are much less funny than their predecessors. THE SHAKES to complete this review."
5,Excellent and Important video,"Amazon - if you continue to act in this partial manner by censoring excellent videos such as this, you will lose market share. We will vote with our dollars (if dollars are still currency in the near future). Jeff Bezos - you may think that worshipping your hedge fund buddies and their central banking family owners is the smart way to go. They don't pay your salary, WE do. If you need a reminder of this fact, then just continue as you are doing with this superb DVD. We have options."
1,Piece of Poop,"This was the 2nd model we owned. The first one was a Polaroid that had two screens but they had inconsistent pictures. If I knew how bad this one was and the others that followed, I would have kept the Polaroid. This one wouldn't play very many movies whether new, used, good shape/bad shape. I'm not sure how they could sell a unit doesn't play movies. Makes a good paperweight. Amazon took it back no questions asked."
1,Disappointing,"Soooo disappointed, guess I should have read the reviews before I purchased this item. This is the type of pretzel salt used on hard pretzels sold at grocery and convenience stores, NOT SOFT PRETZEL SALT. The picture is incredibly misleading :/ VERY UNHAPPY"
1,Not Pretzel Salt,"Not Pretzel Salt or even close. It is not white and course crystals; but clearish, thin and flat crytstals. Just threw out. Nothing like the great pretzel salt from Nuts.com."
1,RCA DT100M Doesn't Work,"Does not improve the signal. It might even make the signal worse. I didn't expect much for the price, but it is an RCA product. Of course the power supply is worth the cost if you need it."
4,"Pippin,My Favorite Hobbit","I got this item from Toys R Us.Pippin is my favorite hobbit.He comes with a removeable Gondorian helmet.It's awsome!There are two problems.Once you remove the belt,you can not put it back on.The second problem is that when you put the sword in the sheath,you have to use your mouth to get the sword out.This item is cool and cheap.Get it!!!"
4,Ok workout,"Good mix of cardio with focus on lower body. Amy has better workouts, but it's ok, not my favorite though. Overall it's very fast-paced going from one move to the next with just a few reps making the strength pieces not very effective. I consider it cardio throughout (except for abs+stretch)."
3,Not a great for cardio,"Maybe it's just me, but when I think ""Bootcamp"" I think rigorous workouts that keep your heart rate up. The first 2 sections were not bad for cardio - the moves were great, kept my heart rate up. But the last two sections was completely just about toning. If you're looking for a complete cardio workout, look elsewhere."
3,Tough love,"This is a tough workout for beginners, but nice for intermediate. I would not recommend this to people with knee or back problems, because it involves getting up and down from the floor really quickly and other moves that are hard on the knees. Its a pretty good workout for those of you who exercise regularly, but not for short term users."
4,An Indian Romance,"R.K.Narayan is one of the most popular indian writers writing in English, Admired greatly by Graham Greene & V.S.Naipaul . If you have to read just one book by narayan and nothing more,then this is the book . It is by far the best in bringing out the simple nuances of indian life...and the beauty even in the simplicity of indian life"
2,Like brown rice only chewier.,Not to my taste. Tried one pot and that's it. Shouldn't have tried three pounds. I am sure it is healthy though.
5,the best slider for the money,this glider with ottoman is very comfortable i bought this for my baby's room and is so cute not that big as i expected which is good if you are limited in space like im for the price you couldn't ask for more.
1,wrong size,suggested by Amazon after selecting the correct size - cheaper so purchased - had to return it since it didn't fit.
1,WARNING! Not an official Honeywell Enviracaire product!,"The description says it's a ""Honeywell Enviracaire 20500 True HEPA filter"" it is NOT, it is a generic filter.So glad Amazon has the ""A-to-z Guarantee Program""!"
5,Gollum Crawling,The Gollum is awsome. The hands are kind of brakeable. I almost broke his hand. It looks just like him. The rock part is cool to make hime climb on and you can also use it for other scenes. Any LOTR action figure collector should buy this.
3,Good in parts.,"The nozzle works very well...when it works. Mine started leaking after a couple of years in the Arizona sun, so I emailed BonAire asking for parts. They ignore all questions like this...no reply yet to seven emails.Like so many companies nowadays, BonAire regard product support as an un-natural act. Caveat Emptor.Paul Simison."
2,Looks like Stainless but its heart is Nylon/plastic,Vulnerable to breakage as core is made from formed nylon/plastic. Will see if it last more than two years as my last $ 20.00 plus Nelson 'Fire Fighters' nozzle made of simmilar design crapped out after about 1.5 yrs. Also has lower gpm than Nelson delivered.
4,Homeowner review,Excellent product and well designed against corrosion and galvanic action due to dissimilar materials. Trashed all my other aluminum nozzles which bonded themselves to my expensive hoses and rended them useless. Spray pattern is very uniform and has fine adjustment.Worth the extra cost because they will live indefinitely. I have three that are at least 6 years old and work like new. Stay away from nozzles made by Gilmore (Division of Bosch). They will ruin your hoses after a short while due to galvanic action. I have three ruined hoses due to this Gilmore inferior product.
2,Lifetime only 2+ years ... Not so good!,"I distinctly remember reading somewhere that these nozzles were ""lifetime"" products; however, in spite of it's durable appearance, and heafty rubber guards, with visible stainless steel components, the interior parts are plactic, and the key component broke after dropping the unit from no more than 3 feet. Yes, I did enjoy two summers of use, but the very part that failed is the one component that should be made of stainless steel to insure the ""lifetime"" possibility. At $25.00 each, that is what I expected. You can fool me once ..."
2,Won't teach you cajon at all!,"This video does not live up to all it claims. The emphasis is not on the cajon, the auido is terrible. More for guitar, and clapping than anything else. The rhythms are played too fast and from far away. The author never even bothers to tell you what kind of hand technique, rudiments, or anything else he is using. Towards the end of the video they start getting somewhat pressed for time and he barely plays two whole compases of each rhythm, then you have to see the same thing twice more. All in all, you won't be able to learn anything from it. The only plus side is that you get to hear a wide selection of different palos, this is only useful because I am also a guitar player"
4,"Nobody's Duaghter, review written by a reader who loved it.",This book has a good lesson to it and it may not end on a happy note but that is okay.i feel you have to read the second book to realise the impact of how good of a book this is. so read both book before makeing a jugment about this book.
4,Filter is excellent!,"Filter is excellent. The only drawback is having to cut it to fit the 17000 Honewell model filter. In the end, you end up with some wasteful pieces."
2,Not what I expected.,"Yes, you can cut it to make your own pre-filters, and this case you must. They give you a very long and very wide piece of pre-filter that you must effectively cut to fit your unit. Come on, I want to buy it, put it in, that's it."
2,Product Great; Amazon Price Not So Great,"First let me say that I'm an believer in Amazon. I love shopping online and skipping the crowds, not to mention saving on gas. Okay, now on to my review. This is a great product. Unfortunately, this is one time where Amazon does not have a decent price. Just visit your local Home Depot and get a box for $10 (~30% Savings)."
4,Carbon pre filter,Item works as described. No problems cutting to fit my air cleaner. Just use a decent pair of scissors. I will buy again.
1,"If buying from Complete Filtration Services Inc., it's not a genuine Honeywell filter.","If you're buying this from Complete Filtration Services Inc., they don't sell genuine Honeywell filters. Instead, like others, I got a wide, unperforated sheet that I had to cut myself, and when wrapped around the main HEPA filter, it barely fit back into my HEPA machine. The filter itself has a musty, chemically smell to me, which is making my asthma worse. Sorta defeats the purpose of having a HEPA filter in that case. Very disappointed."
3,Not exact size !,The item was OK but had to be cut to size as compared to original items which come in exact size.
3,filter was too large,"It was a great sell price. Yet,it wss a surpise when I received the filters because it was not the same filter size that came with the original machine order. I had to cut down the filter sheet to fit it into the machine. I believe it will work only time will tell.The original machine filter was really doing a great job in traping all the air particles in the air instead of my lungs. I trust this filter will do just as good job as the original filter."
4,"easy to fit, easy to remove, easy to buy!","....what's to review? yeah, it's a pre-filter. Nothing that's really performance related to talk about here, so I'll just say they are easy to fit, easy to put on, take off, and if you buy enough of them to get free shipping from amazon, they're a pretty good deal!"
2,Honeywell Universal replacement pre-filter,"This filter(from honeywell) still shed lots of carbon (black) particulate, especially when you have to cut to trim to size. These are very fine dust particles. Some of which i am sure clogged the HEPA.I dont believed previous report that said the Honeywell brand of pre-filter dont shed."
2,Not the same as authentic Honeywell filters,"Although this item is being sold as a Honeywell Universal Replacement Filter, it is not the same as the authentic one. These filters are thicker and the quality does not seem as good. Useable? Yes. These filters seem to make my air cleaner run harder because of the thickness. Was also harder to cut down to size because they don't have the ""lines"" that run the length of it as a guide like the authentic ones do."
3,Universal filter???,"I have to say that this filter may be considered a ""universal"" filter, but it's only this way because you cut it to size.....hardly consider this universal if I have to do the work to make it fit. It does do what it's supposed to do, but would be nice if I didn't have to do the cutting on the product."
1,Poor performance,I put this on my machine and restarted it and the warning light to replace the filter went back on after 2 days. So I am pretty dissappointed.
5,Good Filter. Bad price!,I used to get these filters for under $8 now they are almost $15. They are good but I would get them at drugstore[dot]com. They're only $8.99 and they have free shipping for any orders greater than $49.
3,Fragile is....just that!,I was very excited to hear about a new Dead or Alive CD coming out and when i got it...well i wasnt all that into it...BUT...this one is more of an aquired taste...the more i listened the more it grew on me!! I do love it now..but there were a few songs that immediately jumped out...such as Isnt it a Pity!! GREAT SONG!! Really!! It took me a few listens but this is a great CD to have and if you are a Dead or Alive fan then you will Love it...if you are new to the band then i would suggest trying Nukelopatra or Youthquake or Mad Bad and Dangerous to Know......Fragile is more for the Die Hard fans of this band...you know who you are!!!
3,For The Fans,"If your not a big fan of DOA,then i would say go for another cd.The only reason to buy this is for the new tracks.Which are amazing by the way.""I Promised Myself"",and ""I Paralize"" are by far the best.The remixes on this disc are throw aways.I only liked the remix of Something in My house,and the remake of You Spin me is just to terrible to even try to explain.The only thing interesting about it is they use samples from the Fan the Flame 2 album.This album goes stale fast.So all in all,the remakes suck and the new tracks rock.SO when you listen,remember this was a contract album,and they are in the studio now recording a follow up.One could ony hope the new album is as good as the new tracks presented here."
2,Not Sexy at All,"How many times can he touch her ""there"" and how many times can she say ""no stop"". Not a great book or style of writing. Don't do it !"
4,Great details but wished that there was more,The Renegade's Woman is a great short book to read. I just wished that it was longer so that the plot and characters could have had more story to grow.
1,Not Even Functional,"This product, while light and looked nice, was shabbily made, would not stay powered on, the graphics looked like they were stenciled. I cannot rate the actual reception as the phone would not stay on. Do not waste your time on this POS."
1,A painful purchase,I was hoping this boot would help with me heel pain but it did not. The ankle strap itches and it is uncomfortable. I don't need pain on top of pain.
3,Too Hot,"The product works very to stretch the tendon. The only problem is that it creates so much heat to your foot, and I think not in the correct place. If you don't mind heat all night, it is great."
2,Not comfortable,I tried to sleep with it but couldn't. It really bothers my toes when it pulls them back. I think a stable split with an open toe area would be better that these that pull the toe back.
1,waste,"A waste of money, I have heel spurs, have tried several products but this by far was the worst..wish I had my money back!!"
2,Not for every foot,"The Tandem Spots Planta FXT hurt to sleep in. I tried different tension, but nothing worked. Some of my toes hurt wearing this, and I only managed to sleep through one entire night with it on. This device may work well with someone with a less flexible set of toes."
2,"It looks cool, but...","The phone, itself is of a nicely designed shell. Past that there is nothing. It is clearly an older model, with a very poor quality camera. It could make calls out pretty well, however most of the menus were in chinese and the ring tones it came with were very obnoxious. I must admit that only reason I bought the phone in the first place was because of the nifty dragon-chrome design on the outside and the fact that the top part could turn around in order to take pictured of oneself. I ended up returning the phone just because it did not meet the quality demand that I had expected. This phone is not worth the $160 at all. However if teh price were halved, it could make a nice entry level phone for a younger person."
5,"Well, Hello, Dolly!","What a back saver the Heavy Duty Ladder Dolly has been for me! I have had minor back problems on and off for several years. Recently, during one of those times, my wife ordered this to help me carry my extension ladder. We have a story and a half house and while the ladders are heavy I could carry them with care. Now, without straining, using this heavy duty ladder dolly, I just roll the ladders out to where I need them.Our slender seven year old grandson lifted and rolled the ladders a few feet demonstrating how easily the ladders could be moved! I also have theGrippster Ladder Taxi #61that fits over the ladders and I use that to carry the front part of the ladder. It is a great back saver! I recommend you save yourself the price of a chiropractic visit and use the money for this. ~ The Boss"
2,Just OK,I was hoping for a better product and they talked about the coating on the bottom of the pans and how they distribute the heat better. Well only the large frying pan has the coating the rest do not. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't come in some sort of mesh carry case because they don't secure tightly and are not that well made. They were not expensive so I am not too upset. These would work better at a campsite with oil because they aren't non stick but not for backpacking. The little cup is really rather useless. If you do decide to purchase them you may want to put some other items inside so they don't rattle when you move. I would also add some sort of strap or bag to hold them together as is they come apart far to easily.I don't recommend the product go for the non stick ones a spend a bit more you'll be glad you did (IMHO). Cheers.Update I was holding this and it fell apart all the pieces on the floor I will be sending it back. Too bad.
5,Mess Kit,I was very nice and what I had been looking for. I would encourage anyone else that needs such a thing to purchase one. It is better than the aluminum set.
2,I've seen better,"I ran into the same problem as others. The top and bottom didn't seat correctly, they kept falling into each other. The handle/bracket that was supposed to seat them together was no-where near where it should have been to hold them together (there was a 3/8 inch gap). Haven't put it to use yet, so can't say if it will buckle when heat is applied for cooking. My recommendation, go to a reputable camping store, and do a visual for fit and function before purchasing. As for me, I'm returning the product and will check out other recommendations."
2,This is before he came to understand India,"This is one of his weaker books. In this, he recycles rather silly psychoanalytic ideas of Sudhir Kakar to describe India, and falls flat on his pace. Nevertheless, it is a useful book to see the evolution of Naipaul's understanding of India."
1,Don't Watch,I am one who watches movies from start to finish (even It's Pat) - I ended up reading a book while this was on in the background. Awful.
2,NOT A DOC,"Staged--and obviously so--from beginning to end, this is a movie that purports to be a documentary. I'm guessing that was the distributor's idea, but whatever the deal, anyone who buys into the notion that CATFISH is anything other than a complete fabrication clearly hasn't seen many documentaries. As pseudo-docs go, this one is no worse than THE LAST EXORCISM or PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It's entertaining and at times suspenseful, but branding it a documentary is misleading, and the story loses a lot of its impact when you realize (roughly ten seconds into the main character's attempt to act convincingly, in my case)you're watching a made up story rather than a documented account of a loser tricking a gullible narcissist into believing in her cyber-fantasy. Had I bought the thing rather than checked it out from Netflix I would've sued the filmmakers for false advertisement."
4,Entertaining.,"Interesting story. Not sure how real it is, but it's worth watching for sure. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Pretty Good Movie,I wanted it to go more in development of the relationship between Nev and Meg. There was little given to that and more given to the end of the story.
5,Good surprising movie,This movie definitely kept me on the edge of my seat! It has definitely made my teen think twice about actions he takes on the Internet!
2,Not a thriller,"**Spoilers Ahead**The cover and marketing were extremely overhyped. I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. It's not a thriller, it's not even that unusual of story, it's just a sucker falling for a housewife pretending to be a hot chick. If I had known it was a facebook documentary I would not have felt so duped. However, I think it they are meta trolling the audience by pretending it's a twisty thriller, just as the guy in this movie was fooled by the sad housewife."
2,I believe this docu-drama to be a hoax,"I believe this to be a scripted docu-drama-- where the audience is as taken in as the young cinematographer appears to be.For me, it's just too coincidental that a road-trip to find out the truth taken by cinematographers should wind up exactly like a well-plotted mystery film!"
2,"Interesting, but in the end it's just the same old story...","Well I didn't waste 90 minutes, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone else. It was an interesting story, but at the end I felt that I was given nothing over the expected result of anyone who has ever been on these sites."
5,Love it,I love this movie. It has a big twist towards the end and it was really suprising. I love the show as well
2,Wow- pretty much a waste,"While the movie isn't bad, and has an underlying lesson that today's social networking-obsessed populace would do well to take to heart, there really isn't anything in this film that makes it worth spending 90 minutes of your life on. I can save you the time and trouble just by reinforcing what you already know but probably have chosen to ignore in order to feel connected to the disembodied avatars on your friends list: you cannot truly know someone until you meet them face to face. Your welcome."
5,Beautiful sound and feel,"I have been playing on Wick 4BS for over 25 years and have gotten my old mouthpiece replayed many times. The gold mellows out the sound and is a beautiful mouthpiece for anyone who requires the low, mid and high registers of the instrument."
5,A Landmark Study,"This well-researched work is a revelation for anyone interested in the roots of American popular music, be it rock, jazz or pop. A good complement to this book is ""The Brazilian Sound,"" which covers Brazilian music and has additional information on the influence of Brazilian musicians on American music."
2,Too bad,"The whole reissue serie hasn't been remastered. Worse, sound is far more inferior to previous reissues. In particular the Sequel serie, which was sounding quite good. So... avoid! It's a shame there hasn't been a proper remastering of the whole Warwick Scepter records..."
3,Way better then the Apple version,I've used this product for a few years and works similar to WinFax and I use both. Recently discovered that using leopard requires a $20 patch. Better to buy the updated version at: [...]
1,Faxstf Pro = Big Waste of Time & $$$,"It got the one star ONLY because it actually sent a fax! Save your money! Poor instructions, Info lost after preview, no editing after preview, no menu bar status huge step backwards!If you have a choice of using this software and getting a boil lanced... Take the lancing!I only bought this because the version I used on 9.2.2 was very intuitive.This version on 10.4.9 ......NOT!!"
5,"Very thorough, great book",This book is the best I have seen on pruning all types of plants. Good use of pictures as well.
5,Excellent Book,We used this book in my 4-saturday pruning class. A book that you will have forever. One of the best on the market. I highly recommend this book to those who want to learn the proper technique on pruning and why you prune and how you prune correctly and when to prune.
5,Comprehensive yet to the point,"This book provides a comprehensive guide to pruning and training, yet delivers the information quickly. A combination of authoritative directions combined with intuitive pictures makes for less reading and more pruning. My wife and I just began gardening and have planted some fruit trees. We didn't know when/how to prune... until now. Highly recommended."
4,Very comprehensive,Great book for reference. One you can use time and again to review the best techniques for pruning and training all sorts of ornamental and food producing plants. I am happy to include this in my gardening library.
2,lay reader,"This book was much too technical, a good book for academics but much to technical for lay readers. I wanted a non serious history book or archeological book about the Celts."
1,Bad Example,"Aside from bad acting and writing, aside from the utter nonsense of the portrayal of high school, this movie was flawed from the very start. Just the idea of a (cool, popular) guy making an (uncool, unpopular, nerdy) girl into his (cool) dream date sickens me. All through the movie I silently beg Rachel Leigh Cook's character to show some spine, to act independently, to act like herself. Instead, she is voluntarily molded into a clone. Was this girl so horribly deformed in character before? No. She was simply herself--apparently something these people couldn't live with.This movie sets a terrible example for teenagers--that acting and thinking independently is something to avoid. I really hope this isn't taken literally."
4,Rachael Leigh Cook stars,"Rachael Leigh Cook is the best part of this entire movie. She looks stunning, even during her geek-stage... I guess the makeup artists just could not make her look like a geek? Well, Freddie Prinze Jr. does a decent job in the movie, he goes through the motions, but does not really make the movie seem real. Being a high-schooler myself, I can relate to this kind of movie-it really shows how importat popularity seems in high school... Laney (R.L. Cook) proves that all wrong... and captures the essence of all those ""geeks"" in high school... beautiful on the inside-and out. Good movie for high schoolers/teenagers."
2,Eye-Candy,"I had high hopes for this film, after all my friends telling me that this movie was so ""All That"" and that it was really good. It was pretty charming all right, and the two leads have some chemistry, but it wasn't very convincing. Come on, people, Laney without that midriff-baring red dress and makeup is STILL CUTE! If the character is cute right from the beginning ( where she so desperately tries NOT to look cute by wearing boring clothes), it's kinda hard to cheer for her or be in a mood like her at the end, isn't it?? And for the rest of the movie, it's not that funny, except for that part where Matthew Lilliard dances..he's so terrible its hilarious. I have to say that this movie is more looks than feelings, but what else do you except from a teen movie?? If you want a REAL teen movie that has REAL characters to it, check out ""The Breakfast Club"". Now that's a masterpiece.. ps>> DVD features weren't that great either."
1,Totally Unimaginative,"I don't understand all the hype about this film-its far from being anything special. The plot-if you could call it that-is very ordinary and echoes about a zillion sterotypes about teenagers. I don't mind the fact that the film is superficial: a film can get away with dealing with superficial characters or situations so long as it has some originality, like Clueless. It's just that the screenplay is second rate and the sort that you can imagine just about any wannabe writer putting forward. It lacks *imagination.* Oh and the acting's not too good either, and the jokes are quite feeble. The only things worth checking out about this movie is the final dance scene and the soundtrack. If you wanna see 'teen movies' with a bit of originality and imagination I rate Cruel Intentions, American Pie and Clueless."
2,Great Movie Bad DVD,"Okay, I just want to start off saying the movie is excellent that is not the reason I rated it with 2 stars, the reason is the DVD! No features, only a music video (great video). Some people on other websites have said this DVD has only 2.0 channel surround sound, even though the case says 5.1, I didn't really noticed because I saw this DVD two years ago. The movie is a really cute, funny and definitely a date movie for sure. The picture quality is good on the DVD. By the way there are two versions of the music video out there the ""She's All That"" version and the ""Dawson's Creek"" version, the video is of ""Kiss Me"" by 6pence none the Richer (great band), the difference is that the She's All That video has the cast from the movie in it, the ""'Creek"" version has footage from the TV show. Great movie though buy it instantly. One note about the sound Disney re-released the DVD with 5.1 YEA!Movie Grade: A+, Picture: A+, Sound: C+ (2.0 version), A+ (5.1), Extras: D"
2,This movie fades with time.,"She's All That was a film I saw almost a decade ago, and although I thought it was pretty good, but I hate it now. It's dated, the dialogue is horrible, and the acting is just painful especially Freddie Prinze Jr. Rachael Leigh Cook looked like a star in the making, but you hardly ever see her in movies anymore. This film has a tired formula, hunky guy bets her can make an ugly-duckling into a prom queen, so stupid and we've seen it done a million times before. Paul Walker is nice eye candy in this but please stay away from this disaster."
5,Hilarious!,"I thought this movie was great. It had a mixture of comedy and sweet-teen romance. It's GREAT! If you haven't seen it, what the heck are you waiting for?!"
4,I would give it a five but...,"i would give this movie five stars but i gave it four because of the scene in the cafeteria. it was so gross, i almost threw up on my best friend. other than that, this movie rocks!"
2,Wherefore all the hype....,"what an underwhelming movie! I thought that this movie would have some genuine cuteness about it but I didn't find very much. The characters are very uninteresting and paper-like. Surface cuteness is there I guess, problem is is that I don't find much life or interest in 'surface cuteness'. I think that it's not so much this movie has fatal flaws, it's just that the whole thing was so blah! I couldn't find myself sympathizing with ANY of the characters! The acting was OK but certainly not top-notch. Bottom line: very mediocre! (Makes we wonder about all these so-called professional movie critics - are they watching the same movie?)"
5,awesome! but why was no soundtrack released?,"The movie was awesome, and the music was great. Too bad no soundtrack was released."
2,There Are Better Movies Out There.,"This isn't that great of a film. It's in no way a classic. She's All That really tries to be a good movie, but never quite hits the mark. The first thirty minutes or so was pretty bland. The plot sounded okay (even though it matched the plot of Clueless quite a bit), but the movie didn't meet the expectation level I had of it. Parts of She's All That are okay, but on the whole, this movie can be skipped because it's not original and is very predictable. There's nothing fresh to this movie, it's all been done before."
3,Ego and the Dillman Series,I found the book informative after getting past all the who's who pictures in the first part. The first ten pages are of Dillman and the celebraties he has hob nobbed with over the years.I am more impressed with the actual content which is what this book should be about. Learning pressure/vital points and how to use them in self-defense.I would purchase his other books and will skip the ego pages.Charles
1,"Kids, don't do Mode One","Kids, don't do Mode One. It will turn you into a weirdo and all the girls at school will say you're a creepy loser and laugh at you.If you're an adult virgin, this won't help you get laid. You're better off trying to invite a girl you think likes you on a date and make her your girlfriend. You don't know anything about female psychology yet and your girlfriend will fill you in (and you'll get more sex).If you're a well adjusted adult, you know this is useless rambling filled with bad advice. You already know how to walk up to a girl you don't know and tell her she's beautiful. You know that most women don't want to be viewed as a sex object. You also know that doing this with people you know, you will lose your job and your friends.Don't become a weirdo."
4,Bear Scorpion Bow,"This youth bow is very nice. It would have been nice if there had been more instructions about how to adjust the pull strength. I took the bow to Bass Pro Shop and a very helpful employee adjusted it with an allen wrench at no charge, now my grandson has no problem useing the bow."
3,How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen paree?,"This is probably an adequate enough guide for a first time visitor, or for someone who has never made it out of Weehauken, New Jersey before, and is travelling on a student, or barely post-student budget.But beyond setting out the basic tours from Paris 101, the book is really, really skimpy on hotel and restaurant recommendations, and really, really heavy on flakking Rick Steves' products and tours.If you buy just one guide, there are many better choices."
3,Information incorrect,"I'm glad I compared maps. The hotel I'd booked was incorrectly placed by the Stevens' map, more than 2 miles off. This made me leery about other information as well."
5,Great Music,"If you have never heard Josh Holmes, you are missing out!!! Josh is a great songwriter, singer, guitar player, and performer! I have been blessed to know him and watch his music grow. This CD is awesome, as are all of his CDs. Once you have the CD, you are sure to listen to it over and over again..."
1,Very Dissappointed,"Some good information for the truly ingnorant. There is nothing is this book that could not have been completed in the equivalent of a short Sunday newspaper article. All though the author is not selling anything per se, except his book, the inside reads like an info-mercial (high on theory)."
1,any mistake with the price??,45 bucks for 47 minutes of footage featuring a flying machine?? and not even a picture of the item? ...I suppose the price includes the helicopter...
2,"You Can Live Without It, and Much Better.","The author is quite repetitive (how many times do we have to bear her good/bad witches definition throughout the book, and so very poorly explained?). Often Kathryn Meyer Griffith falls in contraddiction describing the characters (once she describe one as short, later as tall), or describing their qualities (now the character, as a witch, is hungry and tired, and later the author declares the main character is feeling for the first time such things like hunger or tiredness, which she'd never experinced before thanks to her former powers). And so on.The quality of the language is not very professional, and I felt like reading a love story booklet, rather than a horror/thriller book.2 stars instead of 1, just cause the author took the effort to spend some time writing the book, and frankly I'm surprised she wrote more."
4,Witches,"The author of the book does a good job with grabbing your attention initially upon reading the book. Chraracters are well developed and most references appropriately made. The only let down comes with the conclusion of the book. If you are an avid reader of horror novels, you come to expect a climatic show down of the ""Good-vs-Evil"" theme. ... Overall, a good book to read to help the time go pass. Oh yeah, pregnancy from a man that lived over three hundred years ago, to be born in our era is a stretch, even for horror readers! If that is the case, Amanda could have easily brought Joshua into our era."
3,Gene Gurney's Lightning,"Published a year after Edward Maloney's book, this books fortunately has a different formula, which made it an welcome supplement to that book. Though not so strong on the photographic material -Maloney's book has far better stuff- this book was one of the first which tried to give an impression of the use of the Lightning by its units and its pilots. This has been done better in later and bigger books, but at the time of publishing this book's publisher set a new standard in describing aviation history, with a bit more focus on the men and less on the machine (Though I missed Marge Vattendahl in this one).An early -and dated- classic, and hard to acquire."
4,A Touching Story!,My son read this book in school. He recommended that i read it. I did. It is a real touching story. I would recommend this book.
1,If the digital version were properly digitized for MP3...,"...this might be a good product.Unfortunately, regardless if you listen to it with headphones (two different pair, two different brands) or if you put them on computer speakers (just to see if my MP3 player is not working correctly), there is a lot of hissing/crackling (specifically on the right speaker to sound like you've damaged a speaker) so this MP3 file is worthless for me. It's not a constant noise but in the realm of brainwave entrainment, it's completely unacceptable.Since I can't listen to it without feeling as though I am listening to it on a bad AM radio station or as if my speakers were ""blown"", I can't give anyone any idea how well this works.Waste of my money."
3,Interesting,"I purchased this book for a feminist literature class and I found it enlightening. I do not recommend buying a book like this unless you have a serious interest in feminist literature, otherwise it might be a dry read."
5,Great Movie,I rented this movie first and enjoyed it so much that I bought it. The actors are terrific and I am proud of Natalie Portman's excellent portrayal. She has come a long way in her artistic talents from her role in the Star Wars movies.
5,"No beans in this movie, truly a wonder",An entertaining period piece with justiceLots of great actors/actressesSome T&A;What's not to like;)
2,Only for the compleatists,"Well, I can certainly see why this TV series didn't last more than 6 episodes....Honestly this just isn't very *good*. I had hopes I was going to get something along the lines of ""Twilight Zone"" or perhaps ""Tales from the Dark Side"", but instead the stories here are basically second- or third-rate at best.Production values are fine--as good as anything in ""Twilight Zone""--but the stories just aren't very INTERESTING. The best one was probably the fifth one, ""Watchbird""....a decent enough tale about robotic police drones gone awry. Looking at the details I see *why* it's easily the best one, as it's written by J. Michael Straczynski of ""Babylon 5"" fame.But really that's about it. A nice try but....just not all that compelling. Buy it if you're a purist and want to build a really *complete* collection; that's about all I've got to recommend it."
3,My rating is 2-1/2.,"I'm not crazy about these vignettes but i leaned towards 3 stars simply because of their originality. DISC 1: This sci-fi series is more intellectual that action-packed, and meant to give you afterthoughts. It wasnt terribly exciting but unique enough to watch start to finish. ""A Clean Escape"" has a good plot but its roundabout execution lacks the mystery it attempts. The scenario of nuclear winter is a believable topic but i felt little for the characters. ""The Awakening"" is my favorite. Can the motive for an alien invasion be a good one, is the question in this story. The ending is a profound one i dont believe I will forget. ""Jerry Was a Man"" is a bizarre tale regarding robots that left me empty. DISC 2: I found ""The Discarded"" an abstract reminder of the corruption and mistrust of government. ""Watchbird"" is an clever rendention of 1984, and ""Little Brother"" is an odd story i didnt care for."
3,some good copelling stories,Basically this series follows in the same vein as twilight zone and outer limits. The good is that some very good writers has contributed stories like the writer of Babylon 5.The down side is some of the episodes are kind of cheaply done. Warbirds comes to mind with some really bad green screening. But in spite of that I found the disc very entertaining.
4,Why only 6 episodes?,"After watching all six episodes in one week I can only ask why just 6? Following the philosophy of the series, it could have at least dozens of episodes. The only fallback I can think is the lack of special features, which I believe would be of tremendous value. After all, it was just 6 episodes, why not give us a little bit more?"
2,Unacceptably loud,"Pros: Dual DVI's, no external power needed, good price/performance ratio (great with a rebate), and decent game framerates.Cons: Loud! I can hear it two rooms away, it totally dwarfs my PS, 3 120mm fans, and 5 hard drives. I would guess it is ~twice as loud as the rest of my system combined.Thoughts: I read reviews that this card was quiet (a major selling point for me). It isn't quiet at all, it just goes whsssshhh. The fan doesn't sound bad (clicking or whining), it just sounds like it's stuck on turbo. After an exasperating duke out with XFX support, I was finally told contrary to previous messages that recommended nTune and Rivatuner that the 8600GT doesn't have a variable speed fan. It is the 2 wire model, not 3. Anyway, if you don't mind a jet engine under your desk, it works fine and games well. I am very disappointed with the noise though, my only option now is to replace it or buy a $30 heatsink that's actually reasonably quiet."
2,Overclock = limited lifetime,I'm a semi-gamer. I play probably five hours per week. I had this card for one year and three months and then it died.Just be aware that the over-clocking may limit the product's life.
4,Great Economy Card,"Bought this card to upgrade the video in my son's Acer computer.Installation was a snap, drivers loaded with no problem.My son is an avid gamer on a tight budget so no top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art video cards for him. (Who wants to spend $500 for a video card anyway?) Bought an Acer that was on sale and added this card. It really makes the system fly.Plays his games at high resolution and doesn't complain about the frame rates that he gets.Great card for the money."
3,Not a proper fit,"Last time I got one of the non-Honeywell filters, it was too big and stuck out the side a bit, but it functioned fine. This time the one from Filters-Now was a bit too short, and it did not fit tight with the side plate causing a loud whistling noise. I added a couple of washers under the tightening knob so that the side plate would fit tight to eliminate the noise. It works fine after this 'adjustment'."
2,Got this filter from SupplyBuy,"The filter arrived ""naked"" in the shipping box. No plastic covering. No other packaging. There are no markings on the filter itself. All this means I can not verify this filter is indeed made by Honeywell. Also, I can not be certain of the quality. I am sure everyone who is interested this product will be very concerned about the quality. I will probably look else where next time."
2,Not that funny,"Larry The Cable Guy is one of the funniest comics ever.He was HILARIOUS in Blue Collar Comedy Tour,Lord I Apologize,and when I saw him live with Jeff Foxworthy at the Meyerhof Symphony Hall in Baltimore.But this DVD just isn't that good.I don't own this DVD,but they played it on Comedy Central 2 days before it came out.I'm glad I didn't buy it.The jokes are VERY crude,he uses a LOT of ""GD"" words,and he says the same things OVER and OVER.Larry has gone WAY downhill.Buy Blue Collar or Lord I Apologize instead of this.I'm sigining off for now.Check out Ron White's new DVD,""They Call Me Tater Salad"",which comes out June 29 and will be shown on Comedy Central June 27 at 8:30."
1,Juvenile Toilet Humor,"Larry the Cable Guy dispenses purile, sophomoric drivel.If you're a seven-year-old, or very drunk, or a very drunk seven-year-old, you will likely find this video very funny. Otherwise you will be embarrassed for everyone who laughs at this horrible garbage.Don't bother."
1,Boring,Larry is funny on the Blue Collar Comedy Tour; there he gives you the impression that he plays the dumb redneck which is funny. But on this DVD he gives you the impression that he is the dumb redneck. Then he becomes boring. And I hate it that he denies others the right of freedom of speech.
1,git-r-dumb,"perhaps dvd footage of larry being sterilized would be more worthwhile. oh yeah, sorry about that whole civil war thing."
5,The STANDARD,This is the set you buy for life. Can't express it any other way. All Clad makes incredible products. I am so impressed. There are no better words than THE BEST!!!!
3,"Nice BBQ tool set, poor grip",This is a really nice looking set which comes in a nice case. Unfortunately the tongs don't grip food too well as they are a bit slippery. I haven't used the other tools yet. I'm not sure I would purchase this item again but hopefully the tongs will improve with use.
3,fun to dance along to,"Didnt like it much at first but as I became familiar with the moves,I really love this now and its one of my favourite dance dvds. A bit complicated at first but once you get the hang of it is more interesting than other dance dvds which become boring after a while. My only complaint is the music for the last track - a pity it wasnt more inspirational."
2,"All too short, very disappointing","When I saw the title of this book, I immediately ordered it, expecting at least something more substantial and factual with better descriptions of the locale and action. I was very disappointed at the brevity and lack of significant detail. The author should have let her characters speak and act for themselves, rather than the descriptions, based on the Zodiac, which I doubt the Iceni used. I wish this had been a better book as I really love Queen Boudica and what she tried to do for her people."
3,Pretty cool,"This toy is pretty cool, but it's not my favorite. The sword slashing action is good and smooth. Also,being able to remove the cape is pretty cool. His armor is VERY cool! Even my mom (she's a LotR fan too)likes his armor! His Anduril sword fits nicely into it's sheath. Also,his sword's sheath is sooo cool looking. My figure can stand up pretty well, if you put his feet in the right positions. Overall a pretty good figure. If you're a fan of Aragorn, then you should get this figure!"
2,This Thing Kinda freaks me out..........,"Boy, it sure looks creepy and not a whole lot like the one in the movie. I think it is too red around the eyes. I deffinately would not like to have that spooky thing in my room, watching me as I sleep!"
3,Gollum figure,The batteries were corroded in the figure and the phrase it is supposedly saying is not understandable. That aspect of the purchase was disappointing.
2,Inspiring but no help implementing,"I expected more for the price. There are some nice ideas and a few plans, but the plans don't contain measurements. This is not very professional and makes implementation very difficult. Nice for dreaming, but no real help planning."
5,Hugely informative,"This is indeed a must-have book. Sunset consistently produces excellent gardening books. I thought I didn't need this, since I have the Western Garden Book. I was wrong. Tons of information on landscaping, materials and technical detail. Lots of inspiring photography. Worth every penny."
2,i use them everyday- they work well when they work,we use the slapper hammer staple for our roofs we redo but they can work so well but we get new ones sometimes that dont work well this one did not thats why the bad ratting
5,Winch wiring kit review,"I bought this kit to add a Winch on my CanAm Commander 1000X. It gave me the ability to use the winch in the front and back easyly. It is of good quality and resonabley priced. To make this kit up from scratch would not be worth the time and money, good job Warn. It also has the larger 250 AMP Quick connect plugs. Glad it was available."
3,easy to apply,"this product is easy to apply, but you have to be absolutely sure of where you want it before applying. if you have to remove and reapply you can damage the bumper. you also have to have more of the 3m tape available because once removed it is difficult to get it to stick again."
1,piece of junk,"Purchased this sight even after reading a lot of negative reviews. I figured because there were also a lot of good reviews that for the price it would be worth the risk. I was wrong. The sight just plain doesn't work. I bought a new $7 battery, took it apart and checked all wiring connections. I don't know what is wrong with it but it just doesn't work. No red dot, no nothing. Not worth the trouble sending it back. Don't wast you money like I did."
1,Waste of money,This one is too cheap to be useable. The glass is so mirrored it's hard to see through from either side. Dot is dim. Unit is very light plastic.
4,Good for the price,"This was everything I expected for the price. It's far from a great scope but works well. It's a bit tedious to get it dialed in, but overall a decent sight. My son dropped his 1000x break barrel with this on it and it cracked in 3 places from a single drop, but again, for the price it worked fine. I have since upgraded his gun to a better scope from DX."
1,HORRIBLE!,I got it and i didnt even fit my gun. it was useless. i threw it in the trash because there is no point returning it.
1,not all that cool,it works. it says crosman on it. the screen is weak. it shows a red dot though. idk. i guess it looks ok on some guns and it comes with two different mounting brackets so that's convenient.
5,She loved it,This was a Christmas gift for a friend who had just redone her kitchen in roosters and she loved it. Thanks.
3,Vest review,"I like the cost of the vest. However, the feathers are constantly coming out. Otherwise it's great."
3,Down Vest Review,"The vest is nice. The only problem is that the feathers come out of it very easily. It seems like every time I wear it, I find loose feathers."
5,*thumbs up*,"I sooo love this album, i listen to it so many times a day. i really like it cuz it has a mix of all kinds of music:)"
3,Enjoyable but Hurried,"The concept is a lady hides away on a ship as a boy to avoid going to a convant while her uncle is away in Ireland. When she arrives, due to the conflict in the area by the ""rebels"", and she gets kidnapped while strolling outside.I liked the characters, but like others have said, it seemed a bit rushed for the two to fall in love after constantly butting heads. I liked the change of scene from England to Ireland and back, so that you aren't stuck reading the same thing over and over. The Queen was nicely depicted, although I can't really speak on it's accuracy. It moves quickly, and thats the main problem. She changes from fiesty to cool and collected in her new marriage basically overnight. All in all, an enjoyable read, especially for the price."
2,Pretty awful,"It has potential, but runs too fast. It's terribly unbelievable, I don't understand the reasoning or pace or how any of this could have possibly happened."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I picked this glider out because it came with the ottoman and wasn't going to set us back a fortune and I'm happy I did. It was very easy to put together, with the small exception of the arm padding that took some effort to get snapped on. The cusions aren't the best quality but I just tossed a blanket over the back of the chair and have been very happy so far. This glider was a great place to relax while I was waiting for baby, and now that he's here it has been a great place for us to eat, relax and bond. If you don't want to spend the big bucks on a glider I would recomend this one, it's a good value for the money you'll spend."
1,Do not buy this glider!!!!!!,I bought this glider before the birth of my child. It was great for 3 months then after that it started to fall apart. My daughter is only 22 months and 4 months ago the arm fell off; completly and now it squeeks everytime I rock her. She loves to be rocked and we love rocking her so now we need to buy another rocker and this time I will spend a little more because I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Old Friends are STILL Energetic After All These Years!,"Read the negatives of the other reviews BUT do yourself a favor: even if you're buying this used-it's well worth it! The subtle changes in the arrangements, great musicianship and transitions between the songs (I dare you to not get goosebumps between ""My Little Town"" and ""Bridge...""),effortless vocals that, while occassionally showing their age, flow like you've never heard 'em! And the new song ""Citizen of The Planet"" is a must have because it speaks to what is happening in our world today."
5,This Book Was So Great!!!!!!!!,"This book was so great!!!! When I first got this book I didn't know squat, but ever since I got this book middle school doesn't seem that much scary to me anymore. So if your starting middle school then you should buy this book,also if you in 7th, 8th, and even beyond use this book for help throughout your school years!"
1,Very poor constructed...It is a piece of JUNK!,"Simply put. The lid is very hard to get on but when the coffee is percing the top will pop up. This causes the basket to shift and now the coffee doesnt perc properly. Also, the stem is a litte crooked and doesnt sit center int he pot, so it makes it hard to get everything together. This is a pice of JUNK!!! dont waste your money. I have a Cabelas 6 cup, which is fantastic and I am going to order there 24 cup."
3,20 cup percolator,The size is wonderful as expected gets and stays very hot and may be alttle small. The spout is definetly a bit smaller than expected so it pours slowly. I prefer to use this pot over my electric one which grinds and makes coffee because of the size and taste of the coffee. It also is hotter.
1,WARNING!!,"THIS NOT A 20 CUP PERCOLATOR!! Using a measuring cup, only 12 cups of water can be poured in until it reaches the bottom of the filter!! The box and percolator both say 20 cup, do not believe it. Other than that, it works good."
2,OK Big Joe album,"If you're like me you might have bought this album thinking it was early big joe, and less expensive than the two document albums with his stuff on it. This is not early big joe, this is him sounding quite a bit older, like he does on some of the NO MORE WHISKEY album, particularly shake your boogie. He almost sounds like he's sick and has a throat ache and a big hocker in the back of his throat for most of the songs. Standouts, not much, Don't the Apples look mellow is good, but not essential Big Joe. No liner notes either. Could have been recorded in the late 60's, since he talks about the Fickle Pickle, a place he played, and Mike Bloomfield, who wrote a book on him, but sounds more too me like mid-1970s big joe."
5,GOOD STUFF for naturals like me...,"this is the only moisturizing product i'll use for my hair..i've been using it for years on my locs and they shine on!consistency is light, it'll melt with body temperture. the smell is the highlight---so freshly herbal, not fruity or sweet. i always get- what's that smell? what kind of perfume are you wearing?? it really lifts your mood when you put it on....it must be all that GOOD INTENTION in the jar :)"
3,Had higher expectations,"Based on reading the other reviews, I suppose I had higher hopes. Thinking that maybe it was some type of ""miracle"" product. Once I received it, it just seemed liked any other pomade (grease) I've used in the past. Except it has a distinctive smell, not good or bad just unique. I like more floral smells myself. It seems more organic than most. Maybe it's geared more for people with locs or natural hairstyles. I have a relaxer so greasiness is of concern. Overall, I wasn't impressed, didn't see any significant improvement in hair quality or length. Just seems like something to buy if you're into the whole holistic lifestyle."
5,touching and poinent,"Easily the best Diana tribute book on the market. It leaves the photographs to others, and instead focuses on collecting a broad selection of comments and thoughts from from magazines, newspapers, politicians, ordinary people etc."
3,3.5 stars for a novelization...,"Claremont did a fairly good job of capturing the action of the movie. I picked up this book after I had seen the movie, assuming it would help me take the movie with me more than just seeing it a couple times in the theater would. This was accomplished; however, I must admit that the only reason this book did not get 4 stars from me is because I was severely annoyed by how many times Claremont used the word ""bub""."
2,They Should Have Named Them The Expletive Men,"If you are a mild fan of the X-men, as I am, you may be thinking of picking up this novel to get a little more back story. While this book adds quite a bit to the movie in the way of added material, the language in this book is awful. Seriously, why couldn't I read more than 3 pages with getting hit with some kind of profanity? It's just stupid. And it isn't just minor swear words either. If what was in this book was in the movie, it almost certainly would have been rated R. If the language wasn't such a problem, I would most certainly recommend reading this. But it is, so I can't."
4,Excellent game,"Great improvement in game play. If you feel like senseless acts of violence, this is it!"
3,The oldest American book on the Arabian Horse,"History in Brief of Leapord and Linden, sub-titled: General Grant's Arabian Stallions, Presented to Him by the Sultan of Turkey in 1879, by Randolph Huntington. This was the first book published (1885) in America to deal (almost) exclusively with the Arabian horse. Its author is universally recognized as one of the breed's foremost early authorities. Although its 66 pages contain only four illustrations and its style is rather antiquated, it is a true collector's item."
5,Absolutely worth it,"This is the best sprayer I have every used in the lawn care industry.Powerful,battery is long lasting and charges quickly.Had one for about 5 years decided to buy another so I can have different herbicides ready to go.Bought a Hudson because it was almost 1/2 price it wasnt worth even that!!Bought another SurFlo!!Very comfortable to wear.The only con I can think of is the design on the base is pointy and if you slide it on a rough surface it will rub the tip off causing it to leak."
2,Only one buttom programs to the rolling logic,"I programmed it as described and I could only get the third button to register with the learn feature of my intellicode based garage door. Seems the rolling logic, i.e. it changes the frequency each time it is pushed only would 'take' on the third button. Fortunately, I only needed the one button, so it did the job and then I used the opener to program my car. So I don't even use it now. For the money from this vendor, I beleive it was the best deal."
3,Picture is not what you get!,"Despite what the multiple images show, the remote you will get is the horizontally oriented three button remote. You will not get the vertically oriented remote that is shown in all of these images! That said, the remote that was sent does work."
5,Fast Delivery,I received my order very promptly which was excellent as I desperately needed it since all my garage door remotes stopped working at the SAME time! No set up was involved and it was quite simple and easy to program.
1,Potentially dangerous product--use with caution!,"Bought this product to protect a very expensive rear hub, and installed both wheel skewers, though not the seat one. Please note: I followed the installation instructions to the letter, paying special attention to the amount of torque because of the specificity of the instructions.After a total of about 50 miles of city riding, I went up on my hoods to climb a hill and my rear wheel fell off! My left pedal jacked up my calf, and the chain and gears jacked up the paint on my chain stays, but luckily the hub seems undamaged.Anyway...buyer beware. There seems to be a very fine line between getting enough torque to keep the wheel on the bike and getting so much that it shears the skewer off."
3,good read,"This book offers good stories about the genesis of the Yellow Submarine film, and was at times very interesting, but got kinda repetitious after awhile. I was disappointed by the lack of artwork and pictures - there are only a handful, and many of those are mere sketches. If you don't know anything about the film, then you'll learn a lot of facts about the production of this classic...just don't expect to be bowled over with photo evidence."
4,More sweet than salty,Was hopeing it was more salty. The bag opens and rips easily. Once open it needs to be poured into a zip lock quart sized bag. Some saltiness but more sweet than I was expecting. I'm ordering a different brand next time w/hopes of a saltier flavor. It's good for what it is...Downgraded because of the poorly designed bag. It can't be resealed and usu makes a mess.
1,Mediocre at best,"I like guitar DVDS. I like avante guard music. I like experimental music. Any music done with a guitar.Miraslav is never anything but outstanding. No matter what, no matter where.The close ups of Trilok sticking a bell in water to get ""different"" sounds was, well, less than inspiring.Terje is just not up to the standards of anyone I know of. I don't have the slightest idea how he got so popular. Is it new age?? He's no Ottmar leibert. Is it jazz? He's no Mike Stern. No, not by a long long shot. In fact he is not half as good as anyone I can think of. Not half as good as Jan Akkerman. German experimentalist Fred ( uhm what's his last name). Not even close. In fact don't bother with this DVD if your looking for good guitar playing. Take your money and go get some hot dogs and eat them. You will enjoy that a whole lot more."
5,All-time favorite bedtime book for my kids,"This was probably the favorite bedtime book for all three of my kids around ages 4-6. And my 12 and 10 year old will still listen in when I read it to my seven year old.it has fun art, good rhyming structure, and lots of hilarious-to-the-audience made up words."
1,"China made, but better quality than I first thought.","I gave this product a poor rating at first because it just seemed so ""tinny"".I now use it everyday for my coffee and tea and it is more durable thanI thought. The outside stays shiney and it does what I wanted it to do.Make a good cup of coffee."
3,Not the right film; I returned it and got a refund,"Sorry to say, this was a grossly misleading offer. ""The Wannsee Conference"" is the name of a 1984 German-made film, recreating the actual conference from notes taken by a secretary at the meeting. This VHS tape, though identically titled, was (from what I could gather) a discussion about the conference rather than a re-enactment of the conference itself. I think it should have been more accurately titled so as to avoid confusion with the film of the same name."
1,Definitely Not As Advertised,"Another reviewer (Tracy) summed up the issues with this DVD quite well and thus I would have to agree with her remarks. Little of the film is about the Wannsee Conference, most of it is 101-level history, and - very annoyingly - the audio is all messed up: the narrator can hardly be heard over the ""background"" music. Just a sloppily done effort that is a waste of money."
3,Good Enough,The different picks keep the confusion down as to who's whose. And I don't need to go through a bunch of cheap plastic picks.
5,"The TRUTH, and no lie!","Solzhenitsyn wrote the TRUTH as he knew it, and reviews calling him a liar (and there's at least one that I saw) are just wishful thinking. This book is a chilling documentary of the TRUE nature of Marxism-Leninism."
2,Not so Great,When I plug this into my laptop - and plug two sets of headphones into it.... I only have sound in one ear... on both sets of headphones. When I plug each set of headphones directly into my laptop - I have sound in both ears. Something is not working right with this splitter. I recommend buying a different one.
1,Ineffective Volume Control,"I bought this headphone splitter because of its dual volume control, and clean design. Unfortunately the volume control barely attenuates the sound (somewhere around maybe 20%), and is almost useless. I cannot recommend this product."
2,Griffin SmartShare Headphone Splitter,I have Bose Headphones and it will not work with them. It just barely controls the volume. I wind up going to the Bose Store and bought a Monster Splitter that works great.
3,Good item in general,The item is good but the little gray sliding thing to regulate the volume is too fragile and might come off at times.
3,"Good, but....","This product is great in concept- it fills a necessary niche with individual volume controls (a must when two people share the same source), and performs well....except that the plastic housing for the jack is VERY weak and doesn't give like most normal headphone jacks. I was using it in an airline seat and snapped the housing beyond repair when I brushed up against it. Good product, but be careful with it..."
2,Poor build quality,"I use this splitter frequently as an inline volume control to decrease noise from my laptop's headphone jack, as well as on planes where volume control is sometimes limited. I'm happy with the sound, but not with the build quality. One of the two output jacks now only produces sound in one ear/channel, so I always have to use the other one. Also, the outer rubber coating is splitting open on the cable at the connection to both jacks, so I'm now looking to replace it -- with a different product."
5,The Prom Date was a good book!,The product description above is not true. Matty Winger does not die in this book and about Mary being the culprit is not true as well. This book had a good plot and you'll be really surprised who Duke really is at the end. It's just sad that another senior died in the book and it was one of my favorite. Hint: it's a boy.
1,Don't buy this software,"The software is okay when it works but it's buggy.There is absolutely no live technical support. I sent an email per the online support page, and was sent an email telling me to call a support number. Was on hold over an hour (twice) and fnally gave up. Buy ULead instead!!"
3,easy to use but with issues,"It's easy to use. You capture, you edit, you export the movie to the format you want but... in capturing, if you want to indicate you want to capture more than 2,5 hours... you can't (and for the half hour you have to download a patch or you'll only have 2 hours max). And for recording to DVD you better have another software because this one only allows 1,5 hour!"
2,Way to big...,My son is 4 and weighs 30 pounds.This product said a small for 3-4 year olds so I figured it would fit. This is truley made for a 7 year old. This falls off his body and he then throws a fit. We will be getting a different costume and maybe be able to use this product in a couple years.
2,Too big skeleton costume,"This was purchased for a 6 year old and bought according to the size scale. It was way too large. No chance of him being able to wear it. Costume was nice, but really sized for an 8 year old at least."
3,Skeleton Costume - Body is great; mask is terrible,"Pros:Good valueBody looks greathands look greatCons:Mask is terrible; had to go with a different, more realistic mask; worked well after thatNo shoe coveringsDoes not glow in the darkOverall teh body section is decent. The mask leaves a lot to be desired. Looks cheap and the eye slits are too small."
5,Easy to pour!,I had an old oil drain pan where I had to use a funnel to funnel oil into my oil container. The design of this oil drain pan is great because I could just pour the oil directly into the oil container without having to use funnels. There was no mess at all.
3,Eh.,"Based on all of the glowing reviews with 4-5 stars I purchased this. Two days later I happen to be in an auto parts store and they had a similar pan for $9. Now you would assume that a $9 pan would have some negatives when compared to this over $20 pan. You would be wrong. The $9 pan has a twist on cap for the spout so no worries about liquids sloshing out. Additionally it is a light grey color so you can easily see the color of the fluid you have removed. Everything else is identical. A few days later I found another pan similar to the $9 for $7... If I hadnt already used this pan I would have returned it to amazon. I buy basically everything I can online, but for this I would say unless you live somewhere that has no auto parts stores save yourself the money. this is way over priced. Otherwise it is perfectly good and functions as intended."
5,Wonderful!,"Anyone not familiar with basic recipes and concepts in cooking should check out this book. Chock full of useful recipes (although not very many vegetarian recipes), this book takes the reader on a cooking crash-course of sorts, including tips about which vegetables to pick at a grocery store (""Mom's tips""), what foods you must have in your kitchen, and how to tell when your food is done (and thus avoid over-cooking it). As one of four college students in an apartment, I can testify that this book has been useful to all of us at one time or another, be it specifying what order to put vegetables into a stir fry or what distinguishes over-ripe tomatos from good buys."
4,"Great cookbook, but no pictures","I found this cookbook very helpful as it got me to steam my first vegetables(asparagus al dente) and taught me the real way to make a grilled cheese sandwich(I usually just stick the bread in the toaster and pop it in the microwave, but the real way is MUCH tastier). The tips and warnings were very helpful as it helps you avoid the pitfalls of cooking. I especially liked their must have foods and spices list at the back of their book as well as showing the basics of cooking. This book would have gotten 5 stars if they had included pictures which would've been even more helpful."
4,bought this for a friend,"My friend has a son in college and she asked me to get this for her. I looked through it and thought it looked great. I really liked the ""Mom's tips"" at the end of the recipes. Looks like a great beginner's cookbook."
3,okay,"It covers the ipod well. Protecting it. It is a little hard to get on but it does fit. One of the things i don't like about it is that you can' use it with the belt clip, you have to take it off. So you can't use the cover for the things that you really need it for, like when you cut the grass or run. Another thing is that if you have the itrip you also have to take the cover off to be able to use it. And sometimes it takes a lot of time to take it off and then put it back on."
1,Is it ever going to get anywhere?,"I'm on page 160 and I have to say, NOTHING has happened.. This might as well be a romance novel with no action or anything.VERY VERY disappointed 0"
4,Twisted Brilliance,"Paying homage to the likes of The Wicker Man and a whole heap of paranoia from the Seventies, Unhappy Birthday builds a creeping sense of dread that eventually builds to a palm sweating finale and a pay off that had the audience crying out not once but twice at the preview screening I attended. Solid performances, striking cinematography and a truly unsettling score more than make up for the lack of budget. And although the story meanders in one or two places at the start of the film, it offers a solid balance of dark humour, decent scares and moments of the truly bizarre. All in all, Unhappy Birthday is a refreshing treat for thriller/horror fans of all denominations."
5,a twisted gem of a film!,I caught this as part of a festival at our local cinema and decided to give it a chance - I loved it! The story is unusual and gripping with a real sting in its tail. It has fairly graphic scenes of sex and horror interspersed with very dark humour and even pathos though the overwhelming mood is one of a creepy psychological thriller. A twisted yarn set in a hauntingly beautiful landscape - highly recommended.
3,Waste of Talent,"I must admit that my review on this Sylvia DVD is biased. I repeatedly watch and enjoy my eight classic ballet DVD's. The Sylvia, a new purchase, happened to be quite modern and contained many moves and poses that I would not consider beautiful. The music by Delibes was excellent. The dancers showed their high degree of skills but, as far as I am concerned, wasted their talent.I wish I had learned in the amazon.com's sales description whether the ballet is classic or modern. Maybe I should have known.I sold the DVD through amazon.com immediately after watching it once."
4,cute book,my daughter enjoyed reading and looking at the pictures. the font was big enough without having to zoom in. cute book about a kitten
4,Cute Story,"I like that this story is easy for little ones (mine is 2 1/2) to follow, although the end does happen abruptly."
1,Junk Junk Junk!!!!,This case offers NO protection whatsoever. The phone doesn't even fit and I scratched the aluminum trying to put the case on! Tossed right in the garbage!
5,NCLEX-PN,"The book is in sections and each section has test questions, plus the end has two tests. It has been helpful during my LPN classes this summer. It is easy to follow and has the answers underneath the questions with their rationales. It is a good price for what you end up with."
3,Good Labeller,This labeller is a decent machine for the money. The thing that makes it easy to use are the cartridges. Its also the the same thing that makes it expensive to use. It eats labels like they are going out of style! Buy alot of the labels as they are about $7.00 each. You can get a value pack for less if you buy them in bulk. The machine is easy to use though and is an excellent way to organize all the crap you have around the house that needs organizing. One think I don't like however is the labels are sort of difficult to peel once they are cut off from the machine.Hope this helped you make a decision!
4,"Not all-inclusive, but indispensible","Essential for any medical provider in a hospital setting. Very accessible, quick reference. Could add a few more pages - but appropriate price."
5,Underappreciated Writer,"Let me tell you something, Fender might be the closest thing to a literary sea writer since Patrick O'Brian died. He has an uncanny ear for period dialogue and a way of plopping you right down in the middle of a historical story in a way that makes you feel as if you were actually there and could touch it. Ignore some of the snooty reviews about his earlier books. The guy is a treasure!"
5,Go to Amazon.com UK for this.,One More Midnight [Audio CD] Hal KetchumGo to Amazon.com UK for this. Took a week 1/2 to get to my house from the UK....Item(s) Subtotal: 9.35Postage & Packing: 3.08-----Total: 12.43-----Total for this Delivery: 12.43 = about $17.00 USIt is a great cd may be some of Ketchum's best.Daryl
3,Size chart off,I ordered this by the size chart. It says that xl is equavalent to a 16/18. Which is what I wear in pants. Yet I can not fit this dress on. It is beautiful dress but it looks like I won't be able to wear it until I'm down to what looks like a 14 bottoms.
5,The things we change for televsion,"I'm a huge fan of many vampire legends and retellings. I'm also a hug fan of the Vampire the Masqueraqde universe and still run games in that world every summer. Kindred the Embraced may use much of the jargon and ideas from the game system but it is clear the television producers wanted something more, vampires that were a bit more human and in some ways more powerful. Honestly they could have stuck to the rules and done fine. If you aren't obsessed with the story system though and you can just deal with the new television rules, its good entertainment with a touch of the erotic tossed in for good measure. I really miss ghouls not being a bigger part of the world though. They are so underappreciated."
3,Not Vampire: The Masquerade,"Good series. For the most part I was sad to see it leave theair; However the adaptations from the game took much away from it.Also only using only 5 clans was silly, no Sabat boring... No malkavians... even more boring. But it definately had it's good points, such as better than melrose place... or several other shows. If you want a good vampire drama I suggest ""Forever Knight."" Also vampires are dead. The only thing they REALLY enjoy as per rules of VtM is drinking blood. Just think about it... the only liquid in a vampire is blood. Kinda gross if you're with a female vampire. A male vampire would have to expend a blood trait to... perform. Just the Perspective from an avid gamer... {and now my words become property of Amazon.com ::sigh:: }"
2,Not a smart charger!,"Purchased this for my garage, but was disappointed. The title says this is a smart charger, but it is actually just a big linear charger. Worse, this charger never shuts off, so you cannot leave it connected for long periods of time. So I took one star off for bad description, and one star for charger not being turning off. The build quality is rather cheap, so i took another star off for that. Overall, not for me. I will be sending this unit back."
1,Too sensitve to static,"Bought one of these for work and set it up to use for a trip. The kids were so excited they were watching a movie before I even had the van packed. Right before we left, one of the kids touched it and it stopped working. I returned it and got a replacement. The 2nd unit worked fine for awhile. I checked on it and it was frozez in the middle of a movie. I went to touch it to turn it off and felt a slight static shock. (I wasn't on carpet). And the 2nd unit never worked again. I returned it for a refund.It's too bad, because it was a great design with all you needed to hang it in a car (with headrests at least). Better to pay the money and get a quality product!"
5,This is the best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just can't beleive how great it is!!!!!!!!This tells you everything anywhere from the main body structure, to great shading!I'd give this a 11 star if there was such thing."
2,No instructions and no installation hardware included,"I'm sure that this product works as described, but there are no instructions and no installation hardware included. I am certainly not mechanically saavy, but I can see that the deflector has holes that align with the underside of the hood. The only issue is the package had no screws that you would use and I don't know what kind to buy. For the cost of this product, I would hope that they could afford to include the screws for installation. Very dissatisfied with my purchase because now I have to go track down screws at the hardware store. This product was packaged as if someone assembled this in their garage. Not impressed."
5,"A wonderful book, full of deeper meanings.","This book rates amongst the best I've ever read. From the beginning, you are enraptured, and his adventures, a parable for deeper philosophical meaning, delighted me and touched me. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Masterpiece in the Tradition of American Zen,"This book can be seen on many levels, it can be seen as silly humor (which it is), it can be seen as social satire (which it is), it can even be seen as a religious work (which it is) but most of all what I see it as is a work of American Zen, to truely apreciate this aspect of it one may have to read it many times, but each time you read it expect to burst out in laughter (this laughter is just part of the illumination.)Best Enjoyed with a Hot Dog on a Friday"
1,What is the sound of a Golden Worm eating the Golden Apple?,"A fool was sitting with a jar of hot peppers, eating them one by one. He was clearly in misery, his skin was flushed and his eyes were watering, yet he kept on eating peppers. Fascinated, the Angel of Accord came up to him and asked him why he kept on eating peppers. ""I'm looking for a sweet one,"" replied the fool. This goes to prove he was the greatest of the Discordian Saints."
5,Distilled Mindgroove,"The Principia Discordia (or affectionately ""the principia"") will set you mind a-groovin`. Incredibly funny, Incredibly playful. It's a cosmic experience definately. A large inspiration to my band Screwtape (members.tripod.com/~skrewtape). If everybody read this book and got just a little bit of it, the world would be a much more fun place.forty six & 2, just ahead of me."
3,I love it more than pants- AND I HAVEN'T EVEN READ IT,"after I learn to read I'm totally gonna rock this book out day and night, but until then I can look and smell and sometimes at night, when everyone is sleeping, lick.three stars, one for each eye needed to understand(ha) it."
1,Does not increase signal,"I bought 2 of these, I installed it where the antenna wire enters the house and connected my TV to this Amplifier. I had a better TV picture before it was connected to this so called amplifier, so I opened the other amp in case the first one was bad and installed the second one, but the second one did not increase the signal either, it also made the TV signal worse. The package says it is supposed to increase the signal by 4 db's, but it does not increase signal at all, only makes it worse."
4,Good but not Great,"I just want to agree with the poster who gave this DVD 3 stars, the actual main content of the DVD is great...Suprisingly a lot of behind the scenes footage like Ron Artest trying to learn the Triangle Offense...Lots of great footage of each game and happy that this was not just a 60 minute review where they gloss over important games...Highlights from the Finals are awesome especially the behind the scenes with Derek Fisher after game 3...After all that though it is kind of a let down when the bonus coverage is just segements from the Sounds of the Playoffs which they show all the time on NBA TV...I wish they had put in actual game footage like last years DVD...Which takes me to my next, point when are they going to release actual games in their entirety like other leagues? I know this is the first project since NBA entertainment outsourced to Bombo but I hope they start releasing more dvd's of full games especially of the NBA finals from the last 2 years..."
4,New stuff here,"Anyone interested in Lincoln will learn from the family accounts and traditions of the Enloe family of North Carolina. Plus the pictures - I had not seen a picture of Thomas Lincoln. The resemblance between Lincoln and what could be his half brother - Wesley Enloe, is startling. I had just finished reading David Donald's ""Lincoln's Herndon"" about the life of Lincoln's Springfield, IL law partner. So, much of the last half of the book seemed repetitious. I would buy the book again."
3,My dog won't wear them :-(,"Goggles are cute as could be on a small dog, but my little furbaby won't wear it. He keeps pushing it off. I tried to start slow and reward, but he never adjusted. Maybe your furbaby will wear it. I think it is important to protect their eyes to prevent cataracts."
5,Beautifully made,I saw this movie at the cinemas and had to buy it. Very well made best buy ever! Worth buying it
1,DVD does not run,"I am sorry to say, this second hand product is not what it should be...Two out of three DVD's do not run."
1,bad dealer,"I got this movie for my mother for her birthday (she loves West Indian movies) and I got it from ""movie music"". The first half of the first DVD was all that could play out of all three DVDS. I contacted the seller, but he never got back to me. DON'T BUY FROM MOVIE MUSIC!"
2,Quality control is an issue,"I purchased my PD77b from Samsclub, but since they have no reviews area, I wanted to provide some useful feedback somewhere. My player did not work properly out of the box, it decided to play DVD's only 1 out of 20 tries. The other 19 times, it gave a ""No Disc"" or 'Disc Not Avaliable"" message. When I called tech support, they had me move the lens mechanism back and forth for 30 seconds. That did not solve the issue, and told me, they have a known issue with their product. Haven't decided if i will try for another one and hope i get a good product or get a different DVD player entirely."
3,Had the same problem,Received the product and plugged it in to test it out. Had the same problem as the person said. No disc error. Called customer support and was told that the lens is defective and to ask for a replacement. I will come back after my replacement and decide if it is worth the money.
5,Can't complain,It's a foam block that does what its intended to. Found nothing to complain about yet.
1,Low quality,The first one I got in the mail was warped and would not close properly(one side/corner was always lifted so crickets could escape) so I returned it thinking it was a fluke and must have been damaged in shipping. It wasn't I got a new one and the same problem. So I returned that one and ordered the one with out the hinge and it works great and is of great quality.
4,Heavy duty quality pans!,"These pans did a great job...no sticking or uneven cakes. I am sure these pans will be in my kitchen for years to come. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because the largest pan had a dent in it when it arrived. I didn't send it back because I needed it for an upcoming baby shower cake I was baking. Also I used the 3 smaller sized pans to help me make a ""diaper cake""...it served as a holding pattern as I built the diaper cake. Worked out very well for both uses!"
5,Wouldn't Roadtrip Without It,Easy to use in the car. Good level of detail. Used its predecessor for years and it is nice to have a newer version.
2,National Geographic Adventure Edition US Road Atlas,I was pretty dissapointed with this purchase. The atlas does not have minor roads shown and the scale is much too large to offer much information. Instead of purchasing this atlas you should stop at your State visitors center and pick up a (usually free) state road map. Your time will be better spent at a visitor's center than with this altas. Sorry Natl. Geo. This one just doesn't help much.
5,Best Atlas for the money!,"Looking for a replacement to my American Map, I found this through reviews. Apparently American map was bought out by Rand McNally and the quality plummeted. Despite the easily recognized name, Rand McNally maps are not the quality they used to be. I was fortunate to live in an area with easy access to personally look at potential Rand McNally maps in bookstores, and was quickly turned off with the flimsily pages that stick to each other and tear, and I could tell the cover wouldn't make it through one vacation without significant wear. The NG map has high quality map cartography as well as rich printed thick paper, and a plastic cover sleeve over the gloss cover sheet that provides extra protection to both the cover and spine. Worth EVERY cent!"
4,short information at a glance,This book is 244 pages. It is compiled in alpha order of names of persons and subject to word meanings and discriptions. A very good book for quick reference at a glance. Some information I have found to be contradictions to other writings. But each topic is written by 47 different people. The editors have knowlegde of this and even state this in the preface of this book. I want also to make clear that I only recall a couple of them in this write. For opinions and views of different people is alwas good to see. But overall this is a great buy for the money. There is information in this book that I have not found in many others. Enjoy!
5,Superb,This is an absolute gem. You can feel the pain in the melody and brood over the lyrics. Another masterpiece by Damien Rice.
4,Xmas present,"I gave to my son-in-law for Xmas, don't think he has used them yet, but was pleased to get them."
4,Good but lightweight,"This flag is made cheap and would not put it outside my house (due to wind and snow) however for the price its perfect for inside, or boxing gym. Good link to connect to flag pole. its a good flag for the price."
5,"Great simple item, great price","They fit my Philips SBC HS500 headphones perfectly... They are comfortable, durable and a great value (and I get to keep my favorite headphones). Recommended."
5,new Mobility,This is the best magazine out there for someone like my daughter with Spina bifida! It has some great information in it on just about every subject you can think of! Thanks!
5,Good Adlerian layman terms book,I had to get this book for a theory paper in my advanced counseling skills course and I love how the book is written in language I can understand. The Ansbacher & Ansbacher book is so confusing and out-dated so it was nice to find something I could comprehend. This book helped me out so much on my paper! I recommend it to anybody in the counseling program that has decided on being Adlerian!
1,You get: Blue Screen of Death and Useless Tech Support,"Causes my Dell C600 laptop running XP to Blue Screen -- often. Sometimes it reboots and works; sometimes it hoses up something in the registry that prevents it from working without reinstalling Windows. Contacted Tech Support [sic] on 28 December 03 and they (silently) gave upon 1 March 04. They make no effort to debug, they just say try an older driver. And these useless suggestions take them days to make. You don't need this headache; buy from a different manufacturer."
4,Not what you're expecting . . . it's better!,"If you purchase the Star Trek Ships of the Line 2001 calendar thinking its a calendar, you will find the dates are difficult to read in small print, and it awkwardly hangs sideways, different from where last years calendar may have hung. However, if you are looking for way to have a different mini-Star Trek poster, with amazing space-scapes, and great graphic detail, then Star Trek Ships of the Line is perfect for you."
2,disaster,"The Xbox never impressed me, and this is one of many games that shows me why the system was so weak:The game is pretty awful, overall. The music is terrible. It's just a bunch of techno beats that we've all heard from better games. COUNTLESS other games, in fact. The game gets boring really fast. Skating around the same people all the time is pretty boring. Skip this game."
3,Held my attention for a few months.,"When I first bought my XBOX, JSRF and Sega GT came with it. That is the only reason I own this game. First the graphics: The graphics have a nice quality. Very unique and colorful. The gameplay: It's a fun little skating game with a cool story, nothing more. You don't even have to press any buttons to grind a rail. Just jump on it and your character will start grinding. Story: The story seemed very deep for a skating game, and I was pretty interested in it. There is a multiplayer mode for this game, and I enjoyed it with my younger brother for several months. But once we got other games, this one sat in the closet collecting dust. It was fun for a while, but I'd rather spend my time playing different games."
2,it is so boring,on this game all you hear is who ha when who ever that person jumps and if you ask me it is the worst game for xbox ever since xbox came out don't wast your money on this game like I did.
4,Brilliant Gem,"Brilliant gameplay, stylish graphics, funkadelic beats, supersaturated colors, massive free-roaming maps to explore, challenging but not impossible. I can't put this down!!! Notably eliminates some of the awkward handling of Dreamcast version. Some characters you will recognize (older, more funked out) from Dreamcast version, plus new characters; much much richer and more complex than Dreamcast. Beware of buggy retail copies which were recalled, in which game abruptly terminates after only a few stages."
1,stupid game,"personally, this game is one of the most horrible games i have ever played. It may be fun to skate around for a few minutes but gets very old VERY quick!!! not to mention the most annoying music i have ever heard! i must say, though, it will keep any child under the age of 10 busy for a long time. this game is totally lame! i can see why they would throw it in for free with the new xboxs. it doesnt even deserve a fraction of a star...im out...later fools..."
1,possibly the worst game ever,"This Jet Set radio &^&% is a complete waste of resources. I am shocked that they even made it. Luckily this game came with the Xbox, so i didnt waste any money on [it]. The plot was ok, but original. the graphic were horrible. some of the music was pretty good, but wat really annoyed me was whenever u jump, they would make this annoying sound and after a while you just cant stand it. but the controls were fairly easy compared w/ halo, ( the best game ever)"
2,JSRF,"I'm glad this game with my x box cuz it's just odd. there is really no plot. Towards the middle one of the people in the little gang is kidnapped, big deal. (note, I only played amd beat the game cuz I was sick and my cousins had all the rest of my games). Graphics suck, to animated and the camera angles get so screwed up. You Spend more time recentering the camera just so you can see where the hell your going. Terribly easy, quick, and the charachters get annoying. they start shouting just because they can do a 180 while grinding. So if you like Japanese style, animated game this could be for you, but I would suggest renting it first."
2,JSFR is JUNK,"this game is okay at first, but then it gets boring. i thought that it would be alright (i must have been kidding myself!). i am up for the new challenges (but not this...). i can't see how this game gets such a high rating...i think it is for kids honestly. i am a kid-at-heart, but i couldn't take this...skating game.i just hope ""they"" don't make anymore sequels, they should be doneI KNOW I AM!!!!!RATED TWO BECAUSE SHADED GRAPHICS ARE COOL!"
4,The Game Rocks,well this game is the best games ive got on xbox.i love the graphics the music and the characters. this game is a medim difficulty and is long as long as you remember where you are a 10 year old can play it.
4,What have I been missing?,"I normally stay away from skating/biking/etc. games-I simply dislike them. However, I was browsing trough a video game rental shop, saw JSRF and figured, what the heck, I'll give it a try. What I found was a superbly modelled piece of software. Addictive gameplay that'll have your mom screaming for hours,"" Turn that stupid thing off, I wanna watch TV!""The only problem was that some things were so easy, it actually made play more difficult(i.e. you go near a bar, your're gonna grind whether you like it or not).Overall, I strongly suggest this to all gamers with time on their hands to master the the unique, intricate enviroments."
5,Booik in excellent condition,"This is a good book for women over 50, nice to know that we older gals are still sexy.I am enjoying reading this book and would recommend it for a good read."
1,The DVD content was fine but I bought a new copy and it came to me anything but new.,"Normally I am happy with my Amazon purchases, however, not this one. I bought and paid for a new copy and got a used, dirty - not even wrapped mess. The only thing good about it is the DVD did play. I sent an e-mail and got no response. If you buy and ppay for new - you should get new."
5,Beautifully remastered sound,"The only thing I can add to the previous reviews is that Rhino did a TREMENDOUS job of remastering these tunes, which have never sounded better. Plus, the packaging is wonderful. Highly recommended!"
3,AP German photocopied book,"This book consists of copies with a ring binding. The copies are partly very bad, I don't understand why this would happen."
4,Worked well,Bought the opener to replace a broken one for my 84 year old father. He replaced it himself and says it works just fine.
3,Pretty much just a small frying pan,"I bought this for small outdoor trips, thinking that it would be nice and compact, as well as lightweight. It is both, however, the small boiling pot is too small to hold enough water worth heating. It also tips over if you don't have anything to set it down on while heating. I thought I could suspend it over the fire with a tripod but after filling, it tips sideways and dumps all it's contents. The frying pan is suitable but the handle is a bit flimsy, though functional. After the first use, the ""non stick"" coating rubbed off in some places, even though I didn't scrub it. A knife or fork will scratch it off too."
4,Good Listening Comprehension,"This is just one cassette with an accompanying booklet, but it serves its purpose as good listening comprehesion. The level is intermediate, but even beginners will benefit from just hearing the language spoken clearly in dialog format. Each dialog is repeated three time, once normal (for a studio recording), once very slow, and once at normal conversational speed. There's not much else to say because there's nothing particularly amazing about this program . .. but if you are learning German and want to gain listening comprehension, it's definitely worth the money."
2,Annoying DJ constantly claiming,"First of all, I saw this and thought that I had found an awesome collection of M.O.P. songs for a great price. It's fine if you don't mine J-LOVE (the producer of the mix tape) claiming himself over the top of the actual music about ten times a song. A good mixtape producer makes himself known but not ALL OVER EVERY SONG. J-LOVE has about ten recorded sound bites that he just keeps cueing over the top of Billy and Lil' Fame rappin'. Always ill-timed, always annoying. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's still M.O.P."
4,Not Just Replacing One Odor With Another,"Ozium was highly recommended by a friend years ago, and I've used no other such product since. Its best feature is that it removes odors rather than just replacing one odor with another. It may seem pricey, but is well worth it; Not only does it work well, but seemingly lasts forever. I found this item difficult to find in stores, but thanks to Amazon, it was easy to find and order."
5,OZONE,We have used Ozone Spray in our home for over 45 yrs it top all other sprays being it Last and does not leave any chemicle odor in your mouth or noseIt's widely used in many Hospitals and Hospice areas since the beginning of time for it's known to remove 100% bad elements that is airborne
3,"not perfect, but a good resource for beginners","As a student of Persian language and literature, I had some serious issues with this book. The written Persian component to the words/phrases is full of spelling mistakes. The (colloquial) pronunciation is not always consistent with itself, nor always correct, and a few of the words/phrases are a bit quaint. The book provides a great introduction to the grammar of Persian, but its explanation of Arabic plurals is misleading.That being said, this book offers lots of great vocabulary, as well as many useful phrases that are, for the most part, idiomatically correct and commonly used. This book would prove indispensible to any traveller, and it is a good overall guide to Persian language and culture. I would, however, caution serious students of Persian not to rely too much on this book."
2,Pretty Drab,"This set has a couple of good tracks. 'Here I am' and 'One eye shut' are really the only good ones. Oveall, this is not a get up and dance type of collection. It's good to play in the background at subdued house parties and that sort of setting. This is definitely not a high energy compilation, but if you like your mixes on the mellow side, pick this one up. Just don't expect any stand out tracks, because there aren't any. Overall, a very forgetable set."
4,Great reading,"I first came across this little book on my first tour to Iraq, found it in an abandoned corner on a bunker and it became my second favorite book, I felt so identified with most of the situations that it made the funny parts even more outrageous, being puertorican I know exactly how it feels trying to leave home to experience what's ahead of you. Thums up for Lee Maynard!!"
1,Monologues about trivialities,"These short stories could be of interest, but I cannot share the enthusiasm of other readers. To me they are lengthy monologues by a lonesome soul, whispering to itself about trivialities. I will avoid Andre Dubus. gerborg"
1,defective edition,"Do not order this book. There is a defect in the run of this edition. I ordered, discovered the defect, returned for a replacement, and the replacement had the same defect. It skips at least half of the ""b's"", jumping about 60 pages, then continues for about 30-40 pages, and repeats the same 30-40 pages again before continuing with the rest of the book."
5,Speechless,How can you not cry at the end of this book? It is truely amazing. After I finished it I went to the authors website and wrote her myself. I am glad that Cup made something of herself. Through her story you know that you yourself can do anything!
5,Page Turner,"I was able to get through the book in a record breaking 3 days. I enjoyed the book and felt as if I were watching a movie. Every young woman will be able to take somethimg from this book. From the abuse (mental and physcial), abortion and miscarriages and self-hate/worth. I loved it!"
5,Awesome Read!!!,"My friend recommended this book to me and I just finished reading it today. It was such a great book, I can't believe its a memoir! Its amazing. A MUST READ!"
5,"AMAZING, a must read","This book is truly remarkable. The writing is so realistic and the storyline is such that you can not put it down. This is my favorite memoir to date, and I've read dozens. Cupcake Brown is someone to be admired and applauded for her story of redemption and the message she sends that it is never too late to turn your life around."
3,starts of great but then eh,this book was great in the beginning then in the middle it just died off. It became uninterested. I just put it down.
3,A Piece of Cake,Held my attn. . . liked the book but found it VERY far fetched. But overall it was pretty good.
5,An Inspiration!,"I read this book at the right time...I was considering not finishing law school nor taking the bar, and with only a month before graduation...but after reading Ms. Brown's memoir...I couldn't give up. She went through a lot in her life, but had the stregnth to never give up, and she is extremely successful as a result! She inspired me to finish my ""fight"", and now I'm studying for 2 bar exams. After I finished reading tho book, ironically, she was in town doing book signings. She is a joy to meet in person, and I had her autograph the book for a friend who was also considering dropping out of law school. The moral of the story: after you finish reading the book, you have to pass it along to someone else- I guarantee there is someone who needs to read it to give them support! I am going to buy 2 more of the books to give away, it was that good..."
1,Poor writing,"This book was written at first grade level. I was not impressed with any part of this story and I find it hard to believe that anyone would find this story interesting. Any human who has destroyed their mind and body with the amount of drugs as told by this author, would surely not have enough brain cells left to write a book and certainly not enough sense to get a law degree. If this book is a true memoir, there is nothing to brag about. Many people lose their mother and many people grow up in destitution but they choose to be better. There is always a choice and plenty of government assistance for those who really want to be better than their circumstances. This life story made me sick and I am sorry I paid money for it. Don't waste your time or your money on this poor excuse for a memoir"
4,awesome story!,"I read this book in 5 hours-granted, I am a speed reader, but this book caught me by the first chapter and I couldn't stop reading it until it was done. At the end of the book, I put my head down and sobbed. I sobbed because I could identify with Cupcake even though I've never been abused or on drugs or anything like that. I sobbed out of joy that she was able to make it thru such a horrible past and overcame to make something of herself. I love this book-I do feel that it got a bit repetitive which is why I gave it 4 stars. I also wish she had expounded more on her law school experiences and what happened after law school. This book was so entertaining that I didn't even notice any literary style-that wasn't the point. The point of this book is to uplift and inspire and it did so with flying colors. It also makes for one unforgettable read-I still think of her story everytime I get scared to go back to school. I think, if Cupcake could do it-so can I!"
3,"Nice, but not quite perfect","It is a nice device and a decent price. However, I find it quite difficult to have it run static-free. I'm guessing that it transmits with very low power. The only time it runs relatively static-free is when I drive far from cities.The general idea is good, but I wish it was made a little better."
3,"OK, while it works","The product is definitely very neat, but it recently stopped working after a year of occasional use. One thing I would definitely recommend is adding a fast forward and rewind buttons in the next iteration of this product."
1,Very Dissapointing,"This unit lacks the capacity to use the 87.9 frequency that is seldom used by actual radio stations, and is therefore a good choice for a modulator if you want static free and distortion free reception - especially if you live an an area where the FM band is crowded. Unfortunately, we had to buy the unit to discover this essential defficiency. I feel ripped off and I would advise others to avoid both this unit and this manufacturer."
2,Very Poorly Made,"This product plays music through my car stereo very nicely. The problem is that you cannot read the display screen on it unless you pull over. The swivel head stayed in place for about a month and then it kept falling so you had to keep pulling it back up to change songs. I dissasembled it thinking that there was a screw to re-tighten... wrong. It is just a plastic barrel that snaps into place, when it lossens up there is no way to tighten it back up. The 2 gig SD flash card that Amazon recommended only seems to hold about 3/4s of a gig. I have not been able to figure thast problem out yet. All in all this product is not worth the money."
1,returned two of them...,"Length:: 0:13 MinsSound output was very low with some static; a printed page included in the packaging insisted I press and hold a button to fix that... it didn't. It never recognized either a USB or SD inserted into it. Returned it, got another one, same problems, returned it too. Not in the mood to try again."
3,Just ok,This product is just ok it is kind of difficult to handle since the whole unit is so slender and not so easy to balance with the camera on it unfortunately I did not like it that much.In fact rather than helping you have a smooth video shoot you end up looking for a third hand since you have one hand holding the camera the other trying to find buttons thereby shaking and unstable video. Not that good.
3,Rare and interesting movie,This movie was not as bad as most people made it out to be. This again falls into the area where it was a little known film with some really big acting but the plot line wasn't that bad and the acting wasn't either. Was it the best? Not by a long shot but I've seen considerably worst acting in major motion pictures. I would love to see Anchor Bay re-release this film on DVD.
3,Description of product not clear,I expected an iron that blew hot air. There was not an adequate description. It takes a long time for it to heat up.
5,Love it!,"I love this curling iron. I have an old, old, almost ""tooth-less"" curlng iron that I like to replace. I've looked everywhere, I couldn't find it in the stores. I have shoulder length short hair. I like to curl it inward. The store sold clip-on curling iron burned my neck couple of times. Other ones that I found are brush curling iron and not plastic-spikes curling iron.I'm so happy that I found it on Amazon. I loved it so much that I think I would get a second one just in case they no longer makes this kind. But I do agree with some of the reviewers. The high setting is too hot and the low setting is not hot enough. I wish they have a medium setting."
1,Disappointing,"This curling iron does not get hot enough to work properly. Perhaps I got a lemonbut I did not keep the packaging , not anticipating a problem and now I am stuckwith it."
4,Hard to Find,"I have a hard time finding heated curling brushes these days, and this one works well. I do wish it had automatic shut-off, but other than that it is fine."
5,MINI BRUSH AND CURLING IRON,"this is a very light weight curling iron and so it is great for use at home or while traveling,the brush part makes it easier to do my hair when it is slightly damp and needs a little body. it was well packaged and shipped promptly"
1,Horrible Brush/Iron,"I have looked everywhere for a 1"" curling brush. I was so happy when I found this one. That quickly changed when I used it for the 1st time. It doesn't get hot. It doesn't even get lukewarm. I can touch it with my finger and it doesn't burn. It's a piece of junk. I would send it back but I don't feel like messing with it. I guess the manufacturer figures everyone might feel that way!"
5,an absolute must for Romance/Fiction readers,"I read Wild Swan, originally when I was 17. I'm now 32 and have read all of Ms. DeBlasis' books - I'm on my third copy. Wild Swan is the first in a series of three. Another of her books, 'The Proud Breed' is a must if you want to get a feel for her storytelling without committing yourself to three books.""wild Swan"" is the opening of a trilogy which spans close to 100 years in a family involved with smuggling, horsebreeding and racing and ship building. No one is perfect, everyone has faults and fears. From the coast of Cornwall to Maryland horse country and from the infancy of the 19th century to its near conclusion in 1892, we see portions of 6 generations of Thaines/Carringtons/Falconers and the hope of the 7th in the near future.All of Ms. DeBlasis characters are real to the reader and generate emotional links as if we could reach out and touch them.A definite must for anyone"
4,Messy but good,"Right off the bat, I am going to say that this makes a HUGE mess when trying to remove as a face mask. I ruined a washcloth trying to get it off. However, that hasn't stopped me from using it since it does make my skin much softer afterwards. I add a few drops of Moroccan argan oil when mixing to boost the hydration without any additional fragrance. I am very happy that it does not over dry my sensitive skin or turn it bright red like most beauty/ cosmetics/ ect. do. My recommendation is to wash the mask off in the shower instead of at the sink so the mess isn't as big a deal and to add an oil. Great price for a product where a little goes a long way."
3,Flower arragement on a base with water,This video gives a lot of information on how to make a free style flower arrangement in different bases with water. There is only one arrangement done with roses that covers the use of an oasis the style & design is more structure in the traditional flower arrangement designs. To me it was a disappointment because I was expecting instruction in more of the traditional designs used in flower arrangements by florist in any flower shop.
3,flower arranging for beginners,It was a very basic video on Flower arranging good for the beginner but very limited.
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed - especially since it didnt fit my trampoline, the picture shows 6 poles holding the net up but in fact there are only 4 and the distance was not compatible with my 6 legged trampoline. The instructions to build were not great and need to be updated and the plastic balls on the top of the poles were flimsy. It cost a lot to ship and return for no end result. I have no idea re fun and durability as I couldnt use it."
5,safety net,Great net. Easy to install. Make sure you order the right size. I have seen other reviews that people bought the wrong size and blamed Amazon.
5,These resistance bands have...,"helped me in my weight loss journey. They appear to be of ahigher quality than others I've had in the past.I suffer from a neuromuscular disease that is movementand positionally related. These bands give me a gentleexercise and help me to burn enough calories to help inmy losing weight, that and also a healthier diet alongwith it.I give these bands 5 stars."
1,Very poor workmanship!,"I'm not the greatest wood worker but I do know a thing or two. The board I purchased looks like it was routed out with dull bits. The grooves on the top side look all chopped instead of smooth. The depth of the groove is also inconsistent. The top and bottom surface is uneven where the pieces of wood meet. Feels like an old wood floor. The bottom side (which is supposed to be usable) even has wood putty filling a 1/2 inch hole or gash. The manufacturer wants me to send pictures of their ""shoddy workmanship"" before I can send it back for refund or replacement. I have yet to put a knife on this board so I will take pictures and send them to Mountain Woods. I've seen better quality cutting boards at Walmart for one third of the price."
1,"IF YOU HAVE HH2002, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!!","I enjoyed last years game but there's so little difference with this years that it's not worth the money. I'll take it back today. The players are on the teams they were on last year. The big trades that happened aren't in this game. There's no franchise mode, only season mode and they even botched that. It has the 2001 season schedule, not this years. So if it has the players on the wrong teams and the wrong schedule, why bother? As much as I wish Kenny Lofton was still on the Tribe, it just isn't right.The graphics are a little better than they were but still not as good as All Star Baseball or even Triple Play. I don't even care about the graphics I just want this years' schedule because I like to play the game that is scheduled in real life to be played that day. Good bye, high heat."
4,So far so good,"Put this to use in a very very salt air environment. So far after 6 months, no rust.Color is good also, pretty much disappears from view."
4,Quad economy,"No doubt about it, these disk brakes are not elegant but they install very easily, stop my trikes, adjust easily and don't cost an arm and a leg. Good stuff. You can spend a whole lot more and not stop any quicker."
4,works as advertised,"When looking for new mountain bike tires I read all the reviews for the tread style and price I was interested in. This tire had the most consistent good reviews. My experience did not disappoint, the tire is excellent for riding over all off road terrain. If you ride mostly pavement and some offroad, get the Kenda Small Block Eight."
3,New style Army Flag,"This uses the ""new"" Army logo. Lightweight fabric makes this flag suitable for occasional display like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, etc. While the fabric is of heavier quality that other flags purchased, it is too light for everyday use. However, on those selected days, I proudly display it in recognition of my service to this country."
5,Great book for newborns,I bought this book for my newborn baby. He loves to look at the pictures. Usually once a day he has crib time where he lays and looks at this book intently. He's ten weeks now and still enjoys it.
3,A misleading title,"This book's title implies that it is primarily about the end Permian extinction, the largest known to science. In fact, direct discussion of that event occupies less than twenty per cent of the text. Much of the rest is a history of scientific ideas about the history of life and the great extinctions, with considerable attention to the individuals who advocated them. While the book is written in a readable style, the reader may be frustrated by the author's cautiousness in drawing conclusions about the Big One. The book ends with a discussion of what Benton calls the Sixth Extinction, caused by human activity, implying that it is comparable to the one at the end of the Permian. While this has become fashionable in popularized books about science, we haven't come near the Permian extinction level - yet."
3,GREAT STORY,THIS BOOK GIVES YOU INFORMATION THAT MAY LEAD TO THE DISCOVERY THAT AN OUTSDE CELESTIAL OBJECT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF ALL OF OUR MAJOR CATACLYSMS AND EXTINCTIONS....
2,Dang yo,You all are right. The ink is where they get you. It doesn't even last a semester. It's cheaper to print my papers at the library than at my house!
1,Pass on it,I have read Chinese fairy tale books that spark the imagination. Unfortunately this is not one of them. The language is dull and the illustrations are not up to par...I actually fell asleep while reading them several times. This book does a disservice to these tales and hopefully it will not deter others from trying stories from other countries. I bought this book used and it is still not worth the reduced price. The author probably had good intentions but this is one to pass.
2,Not impressed,"I had high expectations for this book. Normally a story line involving a father/daughter relationship would suck me right in, but Breaking Her Fall just didn't do it for me. Peppering the teenaged characters' dialogue with profanity didn't convince me that Goodwin has a firm grasp on their insights. There was a world of material that the author could have focused on without delving into the neighbors' sorrows and other tangents. I felt as though the daughter's depression and the theme of abandonment were not given the development that could have made this book wow instead of blah."
4,A sweet story of a lonely man&#65533;s love for his children,"After a rough summer night -- which I'm sure you've all read about now -- a father and daughter retreat into their separate worlds of hurt, ostracized and alone, and the bulk of the novel describes how they find their way back to each other. Goodwin's prose is spare, genuine and convincing, much like Richard Ford's, his characters fallible and convincing. No great truths are revealed, no envelopes stretched, but Goodwin's is an engaging and satisfying story."
4,If I could turn back time...,"When God is a Customer is a delightful journey to another time and culture and while reading, makes you wish you could be part of that period. Readers and lovers of western poetry will be enthralled by the use of language and device however; consciousness of these become lost in the humour, passion, colour, tenderness and eroticism of life expressed by the 'women' (the poems infact are written by males taking on the female voice). I loved this book and carry it with me. The editors have provided an invaluable treasure to cross-cultural literature and the everyday poetry reader and I thank them for their insight and trust that this work will be valued by westerners. More please."
3,Friendly service,"Though I had to request a refund, the company was very perfessional and offer a quick refund."
3,Transducer NOT canoe friendly,This transducer mount does not provide for side mounting on canoes. If you do not have a transom then you will need to do your own modification to make the mount work with a canoe.
3,Not very well designed,"Well, its serving its purpose barely - but with just a couple minor changes it would be great. First, you have to supply a power strip which you place in the back of the unit to feed all your chargers. Tricky part is you are unlikely to find a power strip small enough to fit in the back. I found a very short one and I still had to jam it in. I have just two cellphones plugged into and there is no room left in the back, the bulk of the chargers and the power strip is too much. The change bin in the back is tiny. You could make it just 2"" wider and you could actually place your keys and maybe a wallet in it."
4,Ok,"I love glitter glue and I have all kinds. These are ok. As glitter glue they work just fine. And the colors are nice and clear, but I am not sure I would say they really ""POP"" all that much. They definitely have more dimension that plain glitter glue, but you can really only tell that if they are next to plain glitter glue. If you did a whole project with just these thinking it is going to stand out a lot, you may be disappointed. If you really want 3D glitter glue stick with the Stickles. If you are just looking for bold colored glitter glue, this works great."
4,Great color!,The color in this box are great and it comes out easily from the tube. But I wish it drys up quickly so my kid don't have to wait or be extra careful when working on another color.
4,Wonderful Cellist and musician to watch!,"I discovered Zara Nelsova through this DVD of collected performances. This is fantastic footage of this phenomenal cellist who is an inspiration for all musicians by her strong stage presence and innovative musical interpretation. the Kabalevsky concerto is my favorite on this compilation. I must say however, it did leave me wanting to know more about this musician and I was disappointed that this DVD was only a collection of performances and that there was no documentary that told her life story. If they ever re-issue this that should most definitely be added. None the less, This is a most enjoyable DVD for Classical music lovers."
4,the music is very smooth.,Rohn shows us that he is one of the hottest studio artists around. The tracks are tight and very smooth. If you haven't heard of this cat you got to check the brother out. Rohn is definately one of the smoothest guitarists out there on the streets. Guitar fans will be taken back by his hot licks. You got to check this cat out at Rudys in New haven on Monday nights.
1,Same Crap...just more unbelievable than before.....,"Ok, I get it already. Matthew Reilly likes to write super fast, unrealistic, one man hero type books and we all read them. I thought his first few books were entertaining, and a few of the ideas were even thought provoking. This, however, is not true for this book. Besides jumping on the religious conspiracy band-waggon that we all love reading about (see: Dan Brown); Reilly also adds in the cliche' middle east anti- Arab, anti-Israeli, as well as the anti-American party mix we love to hate. I get it already: Arabs bad (except one), Israelis bad (except one), Americans bad (all of them), and Australians are super-human! I was hoping for a little more as his writing progressed and he matured, but I guess I was waiting in vein. All this being said, it is a fast read that mindlessly keeps you turning the pages. Who am I to critic him, I haven't written anything great either."
2,Buyer's Remorse,"I really could have found a better use for the eight bucks I spent on this book. I've read four of Reilly's books and have become a big fan. If I were new to his work and started with this one, I would never get around to the others. I'm about a hundred pages into it, and so far haven't seen much in the way of character development. It's hard to care about a character you don't know. Normally, I'd be rooting for someone by this point. Yes, there's a lot of action; in fact, too much action -- no time for the suspense to build up before the bullets or grenades or lava is flying again and the characters are somehow managing to avoid it all. And yes, there are way too many exclamation points. It's supposed to be exciting. I get it.My advice for Reilly fans is to skip this one and hope his next novel is better."
1,"Huge fan, but real dissapointed","Being a huge fan of Reilly's previous work, i was highly anticipating this one's release. Well, it came, then went right on ebay. It's that bad. It's like all the imagination reilly had in his other novel's has left him. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the ""Comic Book"" quote. Hopefully reilly's next book will be researched with something more plausible to give us."
2,Not in the Class of the Scarecrow Series,"I received an advanced copy of this melange of Riley's previous types of characters and plots. In this one a group of military types with the aid of a little girl go in search of valuable artifacts of the ancient seven wonders. Riley tries to use the formula of the small band of highly trained military types against much bigger military forces and a miraculous escape per every page. Where this worked in the Scarecrow books and in his early work Contest, this story falls flat with too much going on and really uninteresting characters. Riley tries to make the highly confused non-stop action understandable by throwing in many diagrams but it really doesn't work.The only reason I gave it any stars at all was because some of the history of the seven wonders was interesting."
1,Not one of his better offerings,"I've enjoyed several of Reilly's books (Ice Station, Scarecrow) and disliked others (Temple, Area 7). This outing falls into the latter category and shares many of their faults - poor characterization, action that is so outrageous it becomes dull and a ""reality"" that bears little relation to the one we inhabit. The writing is very weak and saps whatever joy the concepts manage to muster from the work."
3,Quite a Page Turner!,"When I picked up SAW and read the first chapter, I thought ""Oh dear God, he's gone and overused his italics key again. I thought the writing was phenomenally bad and I would simply return the book to the 2nd hand store I bought it from. However, I was determined to see what the rest of the book was like. I continued reading and REALLY enjoyed it. I loved the well researched history behind it and although the action sequences are sometimes beyond belief, it was quite the page turner. The sort of book that really ought to be a screenplay, I hope this is ultimately made into a movie because I for one would love to see the Ancient Wonders recreated on screen. The characters were endearing as well, especially Lily. And for once, the Americans are the bad guys! Nice to see Australia getting ahead as well!Well Done!"
2,Didn't like the format.,"Don't get me wrong, I love Reillys' other books. They are fast-paced and his earlier books had more character developement than the recent one. But this book just didn't click on all cylinders like the other books. For one the format was really weird. You would be really flowing and he would but a weird break in the writing. Either by doing someting like..... .....this where he would put in the (....) I can kind of see it like a suspenseful ending to a bad mystery movie. And the killer is.... .....John Doe. It just didn't work for me and kind of took me out of the book, which is good from other aspects but the format was just too weird for me to really enjoy it. But I would liket to say that all his other books are amazing, if you like lots of action, and would highly recommend them to anyone."
3,Watch it in Japanese!,"Ok, normally I am very happy with ADV dubbing but this series goes way off track when it comes to representing the Japanese original. For example, in the original Japanese this volume shows a sad story about a cab driver who loves his daugther and tragically dies on his way home on her birthday. In the english, father is a drunk who abuses his daughter. It's just not funny anymore. The first volume was funny I'd admit, but by the second volume it became rapidly inappropriate. If you love constant fart and sexually explicit jokes, as well as constant cursing, by all means watch it with the english dubbing. But if you want to know what this anime is actually about, watch it in Japanese with it's english subtitles."
2,Didn't work well for my hair,"The price was reasonable at my local drugstore, so I thought I'd try this out as a special treat for my hair, which is in good condition but has a few split ends.Results were disappointing; I used the Placenta treatment twice in the last couple of weeks and it rendered my fine and somewhat thick hair noticeably duller, thinner, flyaway, and more lifeless when compared to the results of my normal wash and condition routine.I continue to use good salon products sometimes, but I'm always on the hunt for options which are more affordable while delivering good performance.My latest find is the sulfate-free EverPure line by L'Oreal. Over the last year, I've been using their original body-building shampoos & conditioners, which help my red hair color last longer and really give my locks shine and body. (Guess it makes sense to try their deep conditioner, now!)"
2,Won't buy this brand again,"Fit and finish is really bad on these cut out areas are off by 1/2"" in some areas and the length was too short.I felt that they could have used more 3m tape,should have went with the more expensive Bushwacker brand."
2,How do horrible controls still get put in games????,"All right folks, be warned. While this game is on XBox, and we all like to think of the graphics first on the big green machine, you'll have a major obstacle in your way. the CONTROLS. it's sorta of bad Mojo, too. this game could have easily been put in the same category (or close) to Devil May Cry if the controls were better. you ONLY get to use the D-Pad, no analog love for us! think Resident Evil Controls, but worse, you gotta push on the old Nintendo-Pad to move. remember doing that back in the days, when we just didn't know any better?? maybe the army has just gotten me thinking like this, but how could something [like this] continue to happen to games? i hate to see things like this persist in any area, especially gaming..."
5,Great Content,"This book is full of all this extra material that has been really helpful to my kids. It includes a great section on time management, some actions to take for improving your grades, and an interesting intermission on how all students can create opportunities for themselves. In that sense, it's sort of a self-help/motivational guide in addition to being a how to win scholarships book--the kind of book that parents should give their kids for the simple reason of helping them get off the couch and engaged in their lives."
2,Only get this if you are in High School or less,"If you have finished high school, I wouldn't suggest you get this book. It is mainly aimed for students who are just about to start a life in high school and have their lives ahead. It talks about what students can do to improve their grades and participate in activities so that they would have something to write in their scholarship applications. Furthermore, it also promotes ideas in ways you can get recommendation letters. In high school, there are a lot of ways to do that, but when you have already graduated from HS, it is very limited. The book does have a few good pointers, which is why I made it a 2 star, but you have probably haver heard it before. It's just said in another way. I can only wish that there was a place I could have borrowed this book. It wasn't worth my money being spent on. Maybe if it had cost me 3-5 bucks, then we're talking."
2,What about the run-of-the-mill kid?,"Mr. Kaplan does a good job at describing the methods that worked for him, and certainly communicated the persistance that is necessary to garner awards of the level he received. However, the real secrets aren't really articulated, just hinted: first, have the grades, test scores and recommendations which qualify for Harvard admission. Second, be a ranked athlete. Third, lead, as editor, a high-school newspaper which has national-level recognition. Fourth, have remarkable writing skills.It's clear to me that superlative skills such as his are prerequisites for the types of awards he received. Most of us need a practical guide for the 'pretty good student, pretty good athlete, all-around-good-kid'. Is there any help for us?"
5,Beautiful puzzle,Compared to Melissa&Doug quality it's far superior. My 3 year son favored this toy for Christmas and still reaches for it regularly. I would say he could have played with it at age 2.5 but not much sooner.
5,Added to my collection of favorites,"This is a very insightful film! I would recommend this film to anyone who is struggling to gain acceptance from their family, espeically their parents regarding their orientation. They still may not understand it, but they will most likely gain a greater acceptance of it."
2,Turned it off....,"I wasn't in the mood for such a heavy movie...There is enough misery with the state of our country that is being ravaged by the fools trying to buy this Presidency..they don't care about minorities, poor, average hard working people..I just can't handle so much grief that our children must bear..Shame on all the politicians that have such hard hearts that all they think about is money.It's a long comment as to why I turned this movie off.."
4,Gut level honesty,"I live in Birmingham also, and I loved this book. It takes a lot of guts to air your secrets in this town. Most Southerners like to hide behind their pretentions. Kudos to the Covingtons for writing such an eloquent and genuine story. In some eyes, maybe the Covingtons will temporarily fall from grace, but they will probably go on to achieve something higher than a ""public reputation"". That something higher is simply the truth, plain and unadorned, and well worth the read!"
5,This book is amazing!,"This book is amazing and I am only halfway through. It has opened my eyes to my issues with self-esteem, relationships, and loving myself in general. I am so pleased that I bought it! I believe it is going to help me heal for sure!"
1,worthless pursuit,"The book appears to be a disorganized collection of author's reflections on origins of life, life itself, order, disorder, reductionism and constructivism. I took pains to read it more than once but I have not found a single thought that I would not have encountered before in writings of other authors and scholars. The author seems to repeat opinions that have been popular among scientists for at least 40 years but his own narrative is written in obscure yet imperious manner. I don't really understand why the editorial review and the author himself imply that the approach is original and innovative. Perhaps minds of geniuses function differently than minds of the rest of us but this book is really worthless for ordinary thinkers like myself."
5,"Really, really good.","The movie is a real 5 star item. Dreyfus plays the main character in true fashion and does the book (which is a 10 star item), a real honor with his performance of Antonio Jose Bolivar Proaño ( The old man). The real sad part is that the author is Chilean, El Idilio, town where the story takes palce is somewhere between Peru ,Bolivia and Brasil's Amazonean region and the movie, is released and available in region 2 format? Spain? Come on.., Dreyfus is american (REGION 1). The author is from South America and the story take place in South America (REGION 4) and it is not available in either region's format? Good marketing focus! I only hope they will sometime make it avilable to the public this side of the world. Everyone who cares about the environment, the future of our world, sustained by the world's green areas and tropical forests will benfit from the message put forward by the book and projected in the movie."
2,Worst seller at Amazon.com,"Product is ok, after I finally got it two months, and five phone calls after my order. Worst experience I've ever had with a seller. KillDirt from New Jersey is a horrible vendor. Beware. Finally after two months they did provide two filters to compensate for their incompetence."
4,Fits just like the one from Sears,Not really much to say except the filter fits and works just like the one that came with the vacuum cleaners... but costs a lot less.
5,Great toy for teaching,Another fabulous Rescue Heroes toy!I've found these great for educating my boys about safety issues and for just plain old FUN!
3,A Little Loud,"I was looking for a remote controlled fan, and saw this on Amazon. The fan is nice looking, and the remote works great, and it does send out a strong stream of air, however, even on the lowest setting, it is loud and disruptive. But if noise isn't a factor, I would highly recommend this product."
4,Cool is Cool,"Since my mother has a Honeywell fan, similar to this one, I felt I couldn't go wrong in the purchase of the same brand. All others have not lasted but a couple years. Her's has been going for about 5 years and is still running strong. I would highly recommend this brand to all my friends and any one else who asked for my advice on the purchase of a fan."
2,VERY LOUD,I live in manhattan overlooking a busy Avenue and so thought that the fan being loud might drown out the street noise and might be ok.Totally wrong- it is like having an engine running in your room.Don't buy this fan.
4,"Loud but what did you expect, it's a big fan","This fan is really nice if you are looking to move a lot of air in a fairly large room. It is loud as many people have pointed out but you have to expect that from a fan this size. The ""Breeze"" function is kind of annoying as the fan speeds up and down it doesn't give you a chance to get used to the constant fan noise. The remote is pretty light and feels a bit fragile but it is nice having that controls everything except the oscillation. The big selling point for me is the metal blade cage. It is sturdy and should be able to withstand a tip over. The plastic ones will break with a fall and are hard to clean."
3,an oaky fan ...,"The fan works fine and the remote is good too. But a few things to be noticed:1. the lowest level of blow is still quite strong and not as quiet as it should be;2. the timer is 2, 4 and 8 hours. I would like to have choices like 30 minutes and 1 hour."
2,This Fan Sucks - Not In A Good Way!,In two words - it sucks! The fan is made from cheap plastic and metal parts - including the mounts that hold the back portion of the grill in place. Bump into fan by accident and it falls apart. Grill tabs that hold the fan top grill to the back grill are hazardous and sharp. I bought two of the fans for the bedroom and living room - the first fan went into the trash heap within six months - the second lasted a year before the motor burned-out. The remote control unit on these fans are one step up from a cheap kid's toy! Spend your money wisely - a better choice would be a column fan from SPJ - but not from Honeywell!
5,Great help for my anatomy class at a great price!,"This is a great book with terrific photos of human anatomy. Although it wasn't officially part of my anatomy textbook reading list, it is always good to see other representations of anatomy so you can identify it more easily. And you certainly can't beat the price on the used editions!No need to get a more recent edition. Human Anatomy hasn't changed much (read: at all) in 50,000 years and the photos are great."
4,"Fragmented score, yet leaves you wanting more.","Brief review written on a whim:""Moving,"" ""gloomy,"" ""religious,"" ""beautiful,"" ""haunting,"" ""dark,"" ""hypnotic"" are some of the words that pop into my head to describe Danna's film score. The music does a good job supporting the film; for example, certain parts underscore the main character's bizarre, twisted mind (although this might be due to the power of suggestion after having seen the film).Nonetheless, once you listen to the tracks (and judging by their length) you might get the impression that these are fragments of musical ideas which could have been further developed. Of course, the limitations inherent in film scoring are well-known.After listening to the soundtrack you might wonder how it's possible that anyone can write music like this. How can anyone ""think"" of writing such hauntingly beautiful chords, etc? That's the genius of the composer."
3,Very Faithful to Stoker,"I admit, this is a very low budget offering. It was done as a web series, I believe. But despite the budgetary limitations, this is an almost word for word adaptation of the Dracula novel, which is a pretty impressive feat. This raises it above the budget and effects, because this was clearly a labor of love. Even the short story 'Dracula's Guest' was incorporated into the movie. So regardless of its flaws (the visual effects are not great; the acting varies) I would recommend this. Anyone can make a movie for millions of dollars - to do it for next to nothing is a lot harder, and director John Johnson deserves credit for making it work."
2,Great if wanting to follow a more modren setting of bram's book,Follows Bram's book but looks like set in about the early 90's. Acting was ok. A very B grade movie. As a vamp fan I would look elsewhere for good entertainment. As a Bram fan it's not too bad.
1,worst knock off ever,"This is a B-flick of a B-flick remake of the movie Bram Stoker's Dracula. The plot is the same, the story the same: set in more modern times and losing all the romance and intrigue of the original. I wish I had not wasted my money on it. It was a chore to sit through."
3,"great art but not much purpose, good for younger babies",this is basically a flip up book. it says for 18 months and up but NO WAYnot really educational in any way shape of form other than it is a book
4,Beauty in mountain biking!,"You like mountain biking, right? But today the sky is grey and the trails are kind of muddy... Take a look at a few minutes of this movie and you will immediatly feel the urge to get on your bike and ride like a mad man!!!beauty in every take!You should also get:Roam: The Collective 2[...]"
5,Cool Cd,I just go this CD. I really like it very much. Awsome. I hear they have a 14 year-old drummer.
3,"nice size, but rolls poorly",wheels are too small and close together and rolls well only on very smooth surfacespocket design and capacity for legal carry-on size is very good.
3,Hold Me Closer Tiny Traveller,"If you are going away and need a bag that can hold one pair of jeans, one pair of Reeboks, a pair of socks, a pair of underpants (briefs, don't try boxers) and a wash-kit that only holds your toothbrush. then i) this bag is for you ii) you must be from Lilliput. My daughter's sodding Barbie backback on wheels is bigger and more useful that this. It is tiny. Not only that, just try standing it up -it falls down more times than Beyonce. Yet the designer realizes this and gives you a shoulder strap, so you can cling it closer to you.If you are off to an Ewok reunion, this is for you. If you are taller than Tom Cruise, avoid."
2,Off night at the ballet,"The principals and other featured dancers are fine but much of the production seems lacking in the kind of energy you might expect of the Kirov. Much of the company dancing seems listless and somewhat indifferent although that may have been keeping in character. Prokofiev's score is merely serviceable, I don't think he was trying for anything more than that. Despite everything it has going for it one can see why the rest of the world hasn't embraced this piece."
5,Perfect Companion,This recorder has served me well as I been able to record interviews for my research project. The quality of the recordings is spectacular. I was amazed at the battery life. I had anticipated having to replace the battery more often than I had to.
5,Very Nice,Works very well for lectures. I bought an external mic at RS. Clip it on my briefcase. Excellent sound quality and usability.
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP","I fail to understand why we, the public, continue to be charged more for products while the products are more and more poorly made! Save your money on this one. It is not only made with cheap material, it is also sized wrong.Irritated Mema"
2,Does not last,"The design is outstanding, but the wood dries out easily outdoors. I faithfully treated my chairs 3 X a year with a wood preserving compound to keep their looks, but they became shabby and splintery anyway."
5,The Consultant's Quick Start,"I wish this book had been available when I started my consulting business many years ago. For those already doing consulting work, or for those thinking about it, this book is a ""must have"" reference text. It pretty much goes from A to Z but for those just starting out, take the chapters on the business plan, the marketing plan, and surviving the first year very seriously. The workbook format is easily readable and leads the readers through each chapter, requiring them to complete various exercises in a meaningful way. It is obvious that the author has had significant experience in this area and her ""lessons learned"" comes through loud and clear. Again, this is required reading for anyone just entering the consulting field. Some of the so-called seasoned consultants will also benefit from this text."
4,Not what I thought,"I bought this book thinking it was going to be a very sarcastic spoof on househusbands. Never did I expect it to have serious undertones.Nevertheless, the book was thoroughly enjoyable and I read it in one sitting (I was down with the flu). The story revolves around Linc, who has just moved his family cross-country so that his wife can take a new position. He decides to settle his family into their new life and becomes a househusband.Linc struggles with depression as he searches for a new balance in his life. He seems to seek some sort of control which he finds in domestic duties. Between running a perfect house, cooking gourmet meals and raising a perfect daughter, this guy is supermom!Thoughtful and funny, the story is a good lesson in life change for all of us. By the way, the recipes in every chapter are scrumptious!"
4,What an eye-opener!,"Having a 4-year-old child myself, it was fascinating to read about what I've been through the last few years, but from a male perspective. You can tell the author has lived this world of potty training, whipping together dinner fast and trying to keep up your self esteem in a world that measures people by job titles and career tracks. Add to that the gender issues and assumptions that we put on men and women, this novel has surprising depth while being very funny. I found myself examing my own knee-jerk reaction to househusbands, that they must be sponges who live off their high-earning wives. Yet I'd never think that of a housewife. Yikes, I'm a sexist and didn't know it!On a lighter note, I just loved how he ended a number of chapters with a recipe for the dinner or lunch Linc had prepared in that chapter's scene. I have made the tortellini and the spring rolls and they are both easy and delicious."
2,"Big, whiny baby","This was one of the worst novels I've ever read. The main character, Linc, was the biggest whiny baby I've ever encountered on the written page. I felt sorry for his wife, Jo, the working mother who the reader actually never really gets to know even on the most superficial of levels.Author Ad Hudler seemed to go out of his way to make Linc, the ""househusband"" come off as pretentious and arrogant as he possibly could've, but I know that was not his intention. I think the author has a lot to work out in his personal life and that came out in the writing of this book. Unfortunately the reader ends up being the unpaid therapist who has to listen to his moaning and groaning, page after page, without compensation."
2,Eh,"In general I'm not into these kind of movies and should have trusted my gut instinct, I'm sure this movie will probably play well to its core audience for the test of us though not much here"
2,Very Strange Movie,"The quick review of this movie could be summed up as an 80's porno film, the kind where they attempt a plot line, with all of the sex scenes cut out. Very poor acting and plot, combined with a lot of 12 year old boy fantasy of the horny milkmaid, stranger, and even horny nuns, willilng to have sex 30 seconds after meeting someone.Movie is an hour and a half of talking about sex, then wholly unbelieveable situations leading to sex, with the scenes cut as soon as the very attractve girls show thir breasts.The movie does have entertainment value in that there is an almost constant stream of boobie shots, and if you like the 'what the hell was the producer/director thinking when they made this' type of movie.I found the movie entertaining strictly on those two items, I like 'boobie movies' as well as movies that are so ridiculous that you cant help but laugh at the thought of someone actually thinking it was worth filming and releasing."
4,Great movie,"I watched this movie once and right again watched it over again the next day. It does have its moments good and bad, but this movie is overall great. The ending really makes the movie for me (and trying to avoid giving away any part of it) really actually left me happy and not sad or disappointed as many movies have been seeming to be saddening or having heavy endings of late. It also carries a few big stars and a few lesser known ones, with Hayden Christensen having quite a few other titles and Christopher Egan (who I really liked in Empire, the mini-series). I would recommend this movie to almost anyone I know, with a few exceptions because of content."
2,Buslink on Linux,"If you want to use this on Linux be careful. I could not get this to work on many different flavors of linux. I could get it working on Ubuntu 5.10. Also, the usb connector is flimsy. It comes with an extension cord, but that's a hassle."
2,Old news.,"This book deals with procrastination in a ""Don't worry, everything is going to be fine"" attitude. I believe that a much tougher more mature version needs to be stressed. I have found this method to be addressed more fully in Dr. William J. Knaus' recent book ""Do It Now: Break the Procrastination Habit""."
2,Too much about self talk.,This reminded me too much of the ever popular self talk movement of the late 80's. Too much about feelings and not practical.
1,Ideology,"This book promotes the internalization of a Protestant work ethic, which is perhaps what readers may indeed desire. Fiore has some interesting insights into the psychology of the chronic procrastinator, but I found the book's ideology too much to swallow:""We all have a number of things we would like to accomplish, things we tell ourselves we 'should' accomplish -- increasing our net profits, learning to play the piano, making a million dollars, taking a vacation, writing a book, finishing a degree, repairing the house, losing ten pounds, spending more time with friends, getting up earlier..."" --- how much more bourgeois can this book get?Procrastinators, you are more than producers!! No matter how ""fun"" efficiency can be, life is more than setting and meeting goals."
4,Clutter keeps it from being all it could be,"Get your highlighter out because Dr. Fiore really gives some great advice on what you can do to overcome your tendency to procrastinate.Unfortunately, in my opinion, he clutters the book with profiles, descriptions or stories of people who allegedly suffer from procrastination. The stories, frankly, sound made up or like they are composites of several people's experiences. I found this unnerving: going from really hardcore direct advice to a clearly fake story about a clearly non-existent person.Fiore could have made his book far stronger - even if far shorter - by dumping these bits and pieces of fiction.I found that the only way I could get through ""The Now Habit"" was to highlight the bits and pieces of solid counsel and ignore the silly ""case studies"". Do that and ""The Now Habit"" is a good place to turn when you're suffering from procrastination.Jerry"
3,Designed for folks without kids?,"My husband and I are reading this book and it does have some helpful insights and practices. However, I have yet to find any of the examples that mention childcaring as part of time that needs to be managed. I am guessing that maybe the author either did not have kids or has grown kids, and all of the people he seems to profile have these lovely weekends where they have all this leisure time of their own - i.e. garden, an hour of chores, go for a hike, play tennis...yeah, okay. sounds great, but as a full-time stay at home mom and my husband working full time and pursuing an MBA at night, childcaring seems to eat up any extra ""leisure"" time. we are still trying to put his stuff into practice anyway, but I did find it a little annoying that kids never make it into his examples."
4,A very good start,"I bought this book together with MySQL (Other New riders; ISBN: 0735709211) and got started right away. I think the book does exactly what the title says. PHP Essentials, thats it. No more, maybe less. Its very easy to read and the examples are very good. I wish other books would have this easy language. No technocrat gibberish. I only give it 4 stars because there are a few things missing like: examples of how to use QUERY_STRING. Also it feels like that the possibilities of PHP outside the essentials is totally left out. Final words: im very happy with this book, and I can truly recommend it to anyone who is interrested in PHP programming."
3,"Good for Beginners, but not a complete guide","This book has an easy reading structure, but its quite strange that they try to make it ""easy"" from the beginning, but afterwards they jump straight to building SQL tables, etc. When the main idea was to teach you the PHP primers. Woudnt recommend this book much if you really want to know what PHP is from the beginning, and knowing that afterwards it wont get deep enough in to the field."
4,dorie,"AS usual, Tom Selleck was exellent in this drama movie. It was very real to life as a married man with a busy life as a lawer. I will enjoy watching this movie again."
3,LJH Idaho,"Good representation of a ""young"" Selleck. Very true scenario of a young couple whose marriage falls apart due to the breadwinner spending more time with career and other outside influences than with wife and family. Good story, great acting. Would recommend."
3,OK,Directions are a bit confusing. Could be more easily written with more step by step instructions. will go on line to watch video instructions.
2,had little success.,I unfortunately had little success with this product. It may well have been because I was only able to find ultra pasturized milk - which leads to the question: where can one obtain only pasturized milk? - it would be helpful if this information were available with the product.
4,litttle ole cheese maker me,the startup box had everything you need to make cheese for the first time.and the delievery was prompt and everhting was there thanks
4,Wonderful!,"Do you know how EASY it is to make cheese?!This kit will introduce you to the world of delicious, and FUN cheese making.Directions are simple, and everything is needed to create cheese except the milk. I dropped one star because I do wish the kit included mild Lipase for flavor as most people can only source low heat pasteurized milk. The flavor of my home made cheese was light and more like Italian Mozzarella. Lipase isnt necessary when using raw milk.This kit is so simple my 5 year old helped me make our first batch of Mozzarella. Beware: children should not help with the stretching stage as it is hot.She had a lot of fun helping with everything else. It took under 30 minutes our first time.Finding good milk is crucial, ultra pasteurized cannot be used."
1,Save your money.,"Instead of buying a Cliffs Notes version, why not save your money and get an edition of Romeo and Juliet that has good explanatory notes? That way, you get the original language as well as a modern-day translation. In reading Cliffs Notes rather than the actual play, you miss out on Shakespeare's rich use of language (puns, poetry, metaphor, detailed images, neat phrases) in this classic tragedy. I know Elizabethan English takes some getting used to, but please, do yourself a favor and read the real thing."
3,OK but not perfected yet,"I am a photographer who has been using these ladders for years. They have always had weak spots which contributed to them collapsing after a few years. The reason I keep buying them is they have generously sized steps which make standing on them much more comfortable. I ordered a new one last week to replace a broken one. It appears that several of the weak spots have been re-engineered and I look forward to hopefully not having this one collapse on me. The biggest problem I have with the new one is that the re-engineered clips which must be squeezed in order to put down the handle are extremely hard to squeeze, and the pins which must go into a hole to keep the handle up do not line up very well. In other words,it was almost impossible to put the handle down once it was up. I called Amazon and they immediately sent me a new one. The new one is a little better, but not good. Hopefully the company will work on a better solution for the future."
1,Squeals,"ThermoQuiet? Not at all.Installed on a 1998 Chevy Malibu and they have a high squeal sound whenever I lightly touch the brakes. They were okay for the first month or so, just enough time to make them impossible to return."
5,A Mom's review: yes for young readers,"I have a child who is crazy about WWII -- especially the airplanes -- and he likes this book.While it does not really feature airplanes (except on the cover, and vicariously through the brother), the book shows the life of an American kid in WWII, the son of a WWI veteran and the brother of a pilot. Victory gardens, civil air patrols, blackouts, rationing, paper drives, the Mob... it's a good story with a great setting and some memorable characters and scenes.Almost spills the beans on Santa, but does not."
3,suspender loops,"i like this product but when the suspenders shipped it came with belt loops, i received these before the suspenders came so i opened them and didn't need them."
4,Best Gabriel,"This album placed on the world stage an has so many classic tracks that I cannot select one as a favourite. The quality and detail in his music never ceases to amaze , especially when revisiting after all this time. Recommended for any one wanting to try some Peter Gabriel for the first time."
3,Brief introduction to ghosts,"At a measly 48 pages, many of which are dominated by photos, this book is little more than a quick primer on ghosts. There is some unique info geared especially for the paranormal investigator and many of the stories are told from a uniquely British perspective. If the subject of ghosts and the paranormal has just recently piqued your interest, and you think you might be interested in investigating further, this book might be worth a shot for you. Otherwise, look for something juicier."
2,beware,"they must be screening these, let's see if I can write without using flag words. Every week for the last eight I get a note saying that there is a problem with my o.der, every week it's a del.y, every week it's pushed further. It was supposed to be a birthday gift. This has got to be the most an.oying, disho.est way to t.eat a cus.omer"
1,Don't do it,I've twice ordered these glasses over the last year only to be told they are out of stock.
4,"Great glasses, but be careful","These glasses look like ones that cost much more. They are thin, crystal-clear glass. Realizing that, I thought they should be hand washed. But I broke one of them while drying it--the side of the glass simply popped out while I was running a towel inside it. Then I turned to using the dishwasher--and I broke another, which I had put in the top rack (I think it was too close to other glasses). Now I wash them in the bottom rack of the dishwasher, away from all other items, which has worked fine so far."
3,Nothing new here,Nothing new here. I already knew most of the stuff in this book. Nice for someone who never owned a cat before.
4,no this isn't gonna happen,"No, 3 of the Animorphs supposively dead nope can't happen sorry. I sense the ellimist in upcoming books Cause Jake is the leader Ax has to avenge his brother by killing Visser 3 and Tobias well Rachel and him haven't told eachother about their feelings for eachother"
4,A Good Cliff Hanger,David was trouble from the very beginning. However he's not smart enough to kill the Animorphs. The only reason he got as far as he did was because his actions shocked them. I don't think Rachel is going to be shocked. Plus she still doesn't have to kill him. Just what is the blue box capable of? And how can the Chee help? I look forward to reading the conclusion of this trilogy and hope K A Applegate does more trilogies.
4,A GOOD EXAMPLE,"Sadly I read this book before the other two books of the trilogy, and I have to say it wasn't to bad,you wonder what the solution to the problem is(I don't want to mention the problem;it'll ruin the book.) The end was very satisfying,and its a new type of problem. The animorphs wrap themselves up in. It's different,in a good way,but it would be better if you read the books 20,and 21 first,so nothing will get ruined."
1,Annoying Non-Theory,"I picked this book up because it was short and I was drawn to the word ""radical,"" expecting originality in both the content and in the writing. I was disappointed on both counts. Not only is this not a ""radical"" theory, it isn't even new; it's quite banal: give the screenwriter credit. Who could argue with that? But to assert that the screenwriter is the real ""author"" of a film suggests an enormous naivete. So here again is a book written by someone who has never been involved in making a movie; doesn't know the multiple contributions that include the writer, the actors, the directors, the makeup man, the music director, etc. Good writing can justify an unsound book. Not so here. The writing actually intrudes. I don't know what the author's forte is, but it is certainly not film. Finally, this dull little book ends up annoying."
2,Don't expect a good looking,"The real thing does not look as nice as shown. The package is crappy. You can use it by your own but don't expect it as a small gift. This is what I paid for, about $7-8 or so."
4,Alexis,"This USA flag kit is just fine for the money. The hardware left something to be desired, however, I called the company's 800 number and hopefully they are sending me replacement hardware so I can hang the flag."
4,Great flag,I've had this flag for over a year. It hasn't lost it colors and it hasn't frayed at all. The only issue I have is with the steel bracket. It's not strong enough. I've had to re-shaped it to hold the flag upright.
4,Great replacement flag,"I bought several of these for dirt cheap. I understand the other complaints about the pole being cheap, but if you're replacing a 3' x 5' flag, this is ideal! It's a polyester/cotton blend, which is better suited to outdoors than full cotton, because full cotton stays wet for a long time, while polyester dries quicker. And there aren't many full cotton ones for cheaper anyway- why buy a flag that stays wet for MORE money?The nylon flags start at around the same price, and look like garbage. If you're going to hang this flag on a wall, or raise it on an existing pole, this flag is the BEST DEAL."
3,Low cost product,"Very light weight. Bracket bent with first hard wind, allowing flag to dip close to the ground. Reinforced it with large nails and now it keeps the flag high. Heads of screws either stripped or broke off. But, it is cheap, and worth about what I paid for it. The flag itself is better quality than the rest of the kit.Poles and eagle all fit together properly. Several rains and no rust on poles, yet."
1,Didn't get much out of it,"Bought this book for my fiance hoping it would help inspire us to add a few of those ""special touches"" to our upcoming wedding. This is more of a coffee table book of nice pictures rather than something that gave us great ideas we could use for our wedding."
5,The Only One of Its Kind - for Illustrators,This book contains more than 5000 black-and-white photos of men and men in a wide range of poses. Each pose is photographed from 24 angles and enables the illustrator to find the desired one.I cannot find a book that covers a more extensive range of poses than this. A truly useful reference for illustrators.
5,Barb Jungr: A Singer With Feelings and Soul,Chanson - The Space in Between will grab hold of your ears and soul from the first note to the final and make you a fan of Barb Jungr. Barb takes a song and pours her heart and soul into each and every word taking you on an emotional journey. She is also accompanied by some of the best musicians that I have ever heard that help in creating the various moods that cd covers. The songs range from Jacques Brel to Elvis Costello and for good measure there are original compositions as well. Chanson is an emotional journey that you do not want to miss. Barb Jungr is a singer the people should get to know and enjoy. Buy this cd with No Regrets for you will be happy that you did.
1,"""Don't be put off by the titles, all the songs are in English""?!?","I guess the quote sets the tone here -- anything that appropriates 'chanson' in its title ought really to merit the label (like champagne, if you like). Unfortunately, this vanilla AOR doesn't (and it's rather loose with the translations to boot, e.g., in 'ne me quitte pas').She's got fine pipes to be sure, but the interpretations are dreadful. The other comments here are obviously from fans, but do have a listen first if you're not sure -- then get yourself some Brel, Brassens and Gainsbourg and hear how it should really be done...P"
5,Interesting information,"If you think you know all about how the Christian religion got started, read this. Well written and eye opening."
3,A Book ABOUT the Maps,"A quick heads-up: The maps in this tome are too small to read.The book would serve you well if you want the backstory for certain maps of Texas, or if you want a visual so you'll recognize the map when you go to the Barker Center or other archive to actually see the map.If you want an 1868 map showing old roads or original waterways, the book will not help you much. Even with a spotlight and magnifier, the detail is just not there."
2,Not Gret,"The reviews were largely good, however, I had to return mine because it was flimsey and cheap!! I have to say it was over priced as well. If it were $10, then I'd say it was worth it, but not for more then that!"
2,A rather dull book on a not so exciting adventure.,"Messner never gave me a feeling of what it was like crossing Antartica. He went into too much detail on all the problems he had just getting there, but was not very discriptive of life on the ice. I was never drawn into the book and thus did not have much emphathy with the characters. Felt like Messner did more complaining about things than trying to describe the adventure he was on. He complained about his life before the trip, he complained about all the problems he ran into trying to get to Antartica, he complained about his partner during and after his trip, and he complained about there being people at the South Pole. To his credit it probably was hard to write this length of book when the story line was: I got up each morning for 92 days and walked."
5,Voodoo Doll,"I purchased this for a fun novelty grab bag gift. It was much smaller than I expected, but served the purpose."
2,Lacking in bird spirits,I come to my power animal through a syncretic shamanistic practice of sage-burning and arriving at a trance-like state playing my recorder (homemade from bamboo with stone implements). My power animal is a condor however THERE IS NO CONDOR WISDOM in this book. I would not rely on it as a 100% true guide to power animals HOWEVER IT IS AN OKAY INTRODUCTION. I like the animal drawings...mostly.
4,Tons of fun but could be sturdier,"My ragdoll kitten loves this toy, but he is destroying it very quickly. He likes the string part as much as the feathers so he'll try to chew it. The string is worn so thin that it's prob going to snap the next time we play with it. It'd be nice if they would sell replacement lines too. Or make them sturdier"
1,Junk,"Very disappointed in this product. The wand that holds the feathers is a two-piece thing which doesn't stay together well at all. If your cat is the least bit frisky with it (isn't that the point??), it comes apart.Not sure if it's worth the time to send the stupid thing back."
1,Not for active cats!,"I have a Maine Coon. He ripped it apart in one play session! So now instead of playing with him, I have to pick up feathers and other misc pieces off the floor that I don't want him swallowing. You might as well take your money and invest it in ""things I don't want kitty eating"" and throw it all on the floor."
5,This thing is awesome,"This thing is pretty sweet. When you swing it around the room it looks like a bird flying around, the feathers make it twirl in circles and it looks pretty cool, and I'm pretty sure my cat thinks its a bird. A lot of fun. If your kitty is anything like mine, it will love this toy and rip it to shreds very quickly ... so buy extra replacement birdies haha"
3,Problems with swivel,"My cat is absolutely wild about this toy, but I am on my 7th one since Christmas. It keeps breaking at the point where the swivel part is. Once the swivel is broken it doesn't work the same. I wish the company would look into us, but I am unable to find out who the manufacturer is."
1,Da Bird Cat Toy - Easy Store - 2 Part Pole,Not sure if its just my kitten but it took her all of 1 minutes to rip this apart and it drive her crazy when I tried to pick up the feathers to throw away. so on 1 star from Prissy Kitty
1,Two-part pole won't stay together,"...and when I held the end of the top part of the pole instead, I got the splinters others have mentioned. Sad, because my cats went bonkers over this toy."
5,Awesome toy!,Winks just loves this toy. We do have to hide it in the closet so he doesn't dig for it. :)
3,Not the sturdiest.,"My cats ADORED this toy... for the half hour that it lasted. Then it snapped in half and is now unusable. Ah well, it was fun while it lasted!"
2,CAT LOVED IT BUT IT BROKE AFTER 2 DAYS OF PLAY,"It was an immediate hit, and gave my 6 month old kitten lots of exercise. Problem was, after 2nd day of play the string frayed, and then the feather broke off. It was a pity because he really enjoyed playing with it."
2,Cat loves it but BEWARE FIBERGLASS SPLINTERS,"This is a powerful toy! I barely had it unfurled before my bored and jaded cat lunged, and I got clawed trying to get it back....she LOVES it, madly. I don't recommend giving it to a child to use because it takes some thought and skill (and space) to manage it without destroying everything in sight. The package recommends putting it away when not in use, and that is excellent advice. I have to sneak around to hide it where she does not see me do that or she would probably level the place til she got it back. She is not that ambitious, so you can see how appealing it is! I hope she will not be harmed by the clip or other parts when she catches it. However, BEWARE. It split like wood at the far end (as a result of our first skirmish?) and gave me a very tiny but vicious splinter and heaven knows how it might harm the cat. This was not a two part pole, either, for what that's worth. The packing box was big enough for a baseball bat."
4,Great product,"I purchased these 2 weeks ago and just had them put on today. They make the Wrangler look tough. I've stepped on it a few times today and they are sturdy. It was a hassle to loosen the four screws, myself, on the bottom of the jeep cause they have never been taken out. Took it to the mechanics and the last screw of the chasis they broke off. Definitely a hassle to put on if you don't have a ratchet drill."
5,Works great if installed properly,I installed the opener 2 months ago and it has been working great. There is flat cable connecting the keypad to the controller. Buy it only if you can install the unit in such a way that this the flat cable is not exposed. If the flat cable is exposed it will break and the unit would not work.
1,Genie Keypad,"Junk, imported junk! I relied on the Genie name for quality and didn't get it. It worked the day I installed it, but that was it. Money down the drain. Don't waste your time and money on the Genie Universal Keypad KEP-1."
1,Wrong Edition!,"Although this Workbook is listed as one of the ""Buy them both together!"" packages, do NOT buy it this way. Textbook is 4th Edition, and the Workbook is the 3rd Edition.The deal I'm talking about is on this page:Horizons (with Audio CD).Didn't notice, or couldn't notice, doesn't matter, and now I have to stomach another $80 workbook, this time the right edition.Be forewarned."
3,Very Fragile,"Love the shape and the taste of wine in the glass.Hate cleaning them; we play our own special version of ""Survivor"" every time we use them. They break with normal, light cleaning with a sponge. At first I was angry with my wife for breaking them, but then I started cleaning them and they broke with very little force.They're not a bad choice overall if you get a good deal on them. But they won't last long. I can't imagine them in the dishwasher unless you had something special to hold them. If you don't, I bet you'll be picking glass bits out afterwards!"
1,Too fragile - I'm scared to use them,"...The first thing I did was wash them. One of the glassesdisintegrated in my hands as I did so. A few weeks later,a second glass shattered when it was knocked over on thetable. (It wasn't dropped, just tipped over.)I don't think I'm any klutzier than the average person,but I don't expect the remaining 4 glasses to survivevery long. By contrast, other (cheap, department store)wine glasses I have bought have survived many years.Unless you (and all your friends) are *extremely* gentle,I would look for something less fragile."
4,kids crafts,"I am looking for easy outer space crafts to do with about 100 kids, ages 5-12. This book has a lot of great ideas that I will probably embellish upon for my kids, but the basic ideas are really good."
3,Doesn't remember,"After using this product for several weeks, I am finding that it does not keep it's shape and is beginning to flatten."
3,why do they make these of memory foam?,"I don't know why companies make these leg spacers of memory foam. In a few minutes, it's packed down to nothing and your knees are touching! I ended up returning this product, as it didn't help my back pain at all or provide adequate support."
2,Too soft,The pillow was soft and it compressed so much my knees were touching so I returned it for a full refund.
4,Good deal,This item was purchased for recovery from hip surgery. It is very functional and mostly comfortable. The main problem is the heat the microfoam material retains.
2,Too hard,"I ordered this pillow to use while pregnant and for its small size. But, it was hard and uncomfortable - I returned it the day after I received it. I went back to using a regular pillow."
4,"for the price, i really like it","I ordered this leg pillow not expecting much, but i really do like it. I have tried others that went flat or were shapped weird. This one gives support with out being to hard. I am 6 months pregnant and this has done wonders for my hips and knees. I would reccomend this to anyone. I love the removable/washable cover!"
2,HoMedics Ortho Therapy Memory Foam Leg Spacer Pillow withVelour cover.,"I am not at all fond of this product. I found it very hard to use and keep between my legs. I have knee problems and was hoping this would work for them. Sadly, a regular pillow works much better"
3,Thick and okay,"If you sleep on your side diligently and never roll over, this would probably work better for you than me. Since it's a memory foam, it can get a weird shape if you tuck it in odd configurations if you roll over, etc. Then it's hard to get it back to the ""side sleeping mode"", so I haven't been using it very much and it's not very useful in any other position. A log style pillow may be more versatile if you lay on your side and then your back, side, back, etc."
5,A Masterpiece,"I absolutely loved this novel, although I am not a student of Soviet history and have never been to Kazakhstan. It has a majestic sense of time and place and deals with timeless themes: love and family, tradition and change, and the intrusion of government and history into the life of ordinary folk. Mostly, it is about the heroism of ordinary people, and the great courage it sometimes takes to simply survive. A novel of great scope from a great humanist. One of my favorites."
3,"Content 5 Star Binding, paper 1.5 Star","The book is geographically organized with species by season charts, maps and general travel information and contact information (as of date of pub.)for each region. Overall the content is good coverage of the fishing and brief commentary on what to expect. But it can be spotty as only what the editors felt were the major waterways or lakes are covered and minor merely mentioned. Given they had a vast area to cover I give the content 5 stars.I have the old edition and the new edition which is essentially a magazine weight paper and inks bound between covers to be poor. I prefer the old style on sturdy paper. My copy also has some 'mis-struck' pages. (No I don't think that makes my copy collectable- I think it means the printing was cheap.) I give the binding 1.5 stars (1/2 pt. for the many color photos-magazine quality or not color beats BW or none).So I averaged the rating."
3,Black on FDR,"Yes, Black's biography may indeed be more comprehensive than most, however, due to the leaden, sometimes tortured prose, I would recommend this volume as more of a reference source than pleasure reading"
3,Invest in Murder,"The Decker family is deluged with the deaths of their children. Gillian Clifford, an aunt by marriage learns of the deaths when she reads the final one of Raymond Decker in the paper.Aunt Gillian can't leave well-enough alone when she comes from Chicago to attend Raymond's funeral. The family is obsessed with appearance and will do anything to hide their secrets, while protecting their own. They escape to a compound on Martha's Vineyard to regroup their forces and ensnare Gillian back into the fold from which she escaped ten years before.Returning could be the mistake of Gillian's life if she can't discover who murdered three children and Raymond before more bodies pile up including her own.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
4,Inside view behind the vampire...,"The stroy behind Lestat and why he is the way he is. his grim view of the world and the tender side of him rarely seen. In The Vampire Lestat we enter his world, his mind set, his past. What makes Lestat, ""Lestat""."
1,Waste of money,"This book was the biggest waste of money in the world, don't buy it unless you want to get a 16 overall. (I got a 39 with another book)"
2,Beware!,Nowhere does the ad mention this item is only designed to fit ELECTRIC Toro blowers and leaf vacuums.I'm going to keep it and try to find an adapter or figure out a way to make it work with my gas blower hose connection (use a clamp).The factory bags wear out fast and develop holes from debris entering at the nozzle area. Not designed well. Figured this would be a good alternative to buying another badly designed factory bag for my unit. Good luck...
4,Not Universal but It Works Great,"The Toro Leaf Collector works like a champ. I've been looking for one of these for years and just haven't been able to find one in any of my local stores. When I saw this one on Amazon I decided to take a chance. The adapter that comes with it did not fit on my blower so I had to modify the bag collector from by blower to make it work.It does what it is supposed to do very well, limited only by the power of your blower."
1,I agree with Mr. Comer,"I agree entirely with his three failure points. The blower itself seems well-designed and well-built, but this Universal Leaf Collector simply doesn't do the job."
2,New Idea??,"Have ordered the blower/mulcher and am wondering about a DIY collector. Would it work to blow leaves into pile, attach old vacuum cleaner hose/s to mulcher, and just vacuum chopped leaves into wheel barrow or other container for emptying where needed (after attaching end of hose so it's aimed correctly)? Seems like this could eliminate clogging and pressure build-up problems."
3,where's my stuff ?,"U P S told me my stuff had been sent back and i could not pick up at dist. center, the next day they (UPS)tried to deliver again and DID send it back to sender."
2,Toro Leaf Blower Extension Hose - Use with Toro Leaf Collector,It sucked - no pun intended. I connected to the Toro 'leaf barrel' (also purchased at Amazon) but the hose weight kept causing the expandable Toro recepticle to fall over. Wasted time & money.
2,Leaf Collector,"I was hesitant to buy this product because of the very mixed reviews but thought I could rig the thing up to work OK. I was able to do it by using a rachet strap around the cloth adaptor that fits over the trash can so it wouldn't blow off. That part worked fine once I made various adjustments on it. The thing definitely does not work straight out of the box.My big complaint about it is that it is just too slow. If you have a large amount of leaves, it takes forever to pick them up. Also, large leaves don't pick up well and any leaves that are even a little bit damp don't pick up well. The damp leaves don't grind up well and don't compact down as well as dry leaves that break into very small piece.Overall I would not recommend it."
1,Not well engineered-some intrinsic problems,"My experience with this product is as follows:1. The snap on hose connector kept coming off.2.The bag tie that secured the bag to the pail didn't seem to be strong enough. The bag eventually slipped off the pail when under pressure even after adjusting it many times.3. Using this product the blower/vac is connected to a large pail via a relatively short hose, therefore the there is some jostling of the pail. I don't think the product manufacturer took this into account. In my estimation product is a bit flimsy. It must be modified by the user to work properly on a consistent basis."
1,good idea but horrible implementation,The eight foot hose and barrel cover seemed like a great idea but it just doesn't work. The barrel cover is made of tightly woven material and does not breath. When in use the air is forced to blow out of the edges and with it goes half the leaf mulch that was sucked up. The cover should be made of a breathable canvas like the leaf bag that comes with the blower. I had to attach the canvas bag from my old blower to the end of the 8 ft hose to get any use out of it. Toro should tell their chinese producers to use a more breathable material for the barrel cover and send me one so I won't feel so ripped off. I'd return the whole thing but I do like the convenience of the hose. Bad purchase.
3,"Tricky to use, but nobody else has one","This is the only leaf collection device that works with a leaf blower. Why WeedWhacker, Black & Decker, and others don't sell something like this is a mystery. I'm sure they could do a better job.To make sure the bag doesn't blow off the barrel, I had to rig a belt for both the hose and the bag: the bungees just don't cut it. Further, the bag needs to stay clean. Sucking up damp leaves will plug the bag in minutes.One thing I've learned is to use the bag collector (both the carry-bag or the barrel cover) for final clean-up only. The bulk of the leaves I blow into big piles for pick-up."
1,Horrible,"I bought this with the collapsible 43 gallon bucket. This item did not stay attached to anything. After 5 minutes of trying to use it, I decided to return it. If it won't even attach to the Toro bucket, then what will it attach to?"
3,"Great idea, well made, but slow","I purchased this product hoping it would ease the process of cleaning the yard each fall. I own the Toro elecrtric blower to which this attaches. I usually blow the fallen leaves into a big pile around a large tree and then transfer them into large waste receptacles for transport to the green waste recycling center. The leaf collector attachment does indeed chop the leaves well and thereby reduces the volume of debris, but the vacuum process is so very slow. The bag attaches well to your own receptacle. I instead use a large salad tongs like tool to do this and the process is so much more efficient, but I have to deal with greater volumes of debris for transport. I have only used this product once as my other method is so much more efficient. I would say that this product is effective for occasional use or regular use with smaller amounts of leaf debris; for a major cleanup, patience is definitely a virtue."
1,2 books in one,"I bought this book for my daughter, it was on her wish list. Only the description doesn't say that there are two books inside the one, only that it is a movie tie in. The 2 books inside ""How To Deal"" she has already read, I can return it and pay postage both ways again which in total will cost more than the book.I think a better description of what is inside of this book should should be available.ThanksJenny"
5,Great lathe,"Recieved mine today........what a great lathe..no problems with assembly., went together exactly as explained, pictures for every step....no burrs or sharp edges. Really heavy duty all the way. I recommend it.It turns very smooth with no vibration what so ever. (...)"
4,Nice lathe for the price,I've had this lathe about 9 months and have turned both bowls and spindles with it. It has a minor vibration at mid-speed which doesn't seem to affect the turning. I'm sure it is coming from the reeves pulleys and I am trying to get that remedied with Delta. Amazon ran it on sale for $399 and it came with Delta's good 6 piece lathe chisel set as a bonus. Was delivered in good shape and in a timely matter. Seems to have plenty of power and it is fairly well put together. I had a cheap off-brand lathe before and am glad I made this upgrade for the small investment. I've seen alot of bad reviews on this lathe but think that for the average woodturner who does it simply for a hobby this is a fairly decent lathe for the price.
2,Won;t Last,"This was the second flag I have purchased from this company. The first one lasted about 10 months and the last one only about 4 months before it was shredded. I do not live in a windy area, just an occasional thunder storm in the summer. They really looked good when I first placed them on the pole, but that didn't last long. As others have said, you get what you pay for. Will not order another one like this."
5,US flag. 3x5 ft.,"These flags are of excellent quality.We fly our flag all year outside. Theflags last 2-3 years, and are most reasonablypriced."
2,Flag is OK.,"Price is great for this kind of construction. I live in a fairly windy area especially during the afternoons and the ends are frayed already after 2 years of ownership. I fly it from late spring, Memorial Day, to end of October and not all year."
1,Save Your Money!,"Due to the windy conditions where I live, I can expect to replace my flag about twice a year. But this flag did not even last a month before it started shredding. The flag is poor quality and is made with very thin fabric. This has got to be the worst flag I have ever had."
2,Not very good quality flag,Poor quality compared to a similar material flag I bought before. Flag already started coming apart after only a couple of weeks on the flag pole.
4,Great,"Great looking, and has lasted so far. There was a slight misunderstanding about the way it goes on the flagpole, but it looks excellent. my boyfriend loved it."
5,Cut to the heart,I first discovered Derek Webb through his 2006 album Mockingbird when a friend sent me a link from Derek's website stating that the album was available for free download. I was impacted by the lyrics on this album and thought I would venture further into his catalogue upon the recommendation of a friend. I was not prepared to be cut to the heart as deeply as I am by this album. Derek's commentary on the church and his personal faith are poetic and impactful. His lyrics have made their way into both my worship and prayers. Buy this album if you are looking for some honest and raw thoughts on a church whose tendency is to turn away from her first love and the Lord's gracious response.
2,Honestly? I was dissappointed.,"When I heard that Derek was coming out with a solo project I was looking for it because the songs he wrote and sung lead on in the Caedmon's Call albums were my favorite. However, the only song on this album that is really worth a must listen is ""Wedding Dress"". If you have a friend that has this album then borrow and listen to this song. It is painfully honest and it's simplicity musically adds to its poignancy. The other songs had some good lyrics but did not reach me lyrically or musically. I recommend that you wait for his next cd."
