1,Too Boring!!,"I loved all of the books in the Nina Reilly series but this book was a huge disappointment. The premise is wierd to start with, and the characters so utterly boring that I found this book a chore to read. I wished that I had never bought this one!"
2,Stick to what you do best!,"These two writers should not delve into other areas; apparently they have Nina Reilly down pat and her stories are always good. This book does not seem to have been written by the sisters at all. I was very disappointed in the characters, especially the two sisters Kat and Jacki. Are these autobiographical? Sorry, but I would not recommend."
3,A bit overrated..probably,"I bought this album back when it came out, was rather unimpressed, then sold it. Eight years later, I bought it again. I was waxing nostalgic, I still liked that madding ""There She Goes"" song, and spurred on by a near unanimaously approbational historical appraisal, I had to see what was up with this album after all those years. Well, not much, really. There are a lot of neat songs here, and they all sound fresh, but none are really that great (save for that inevitable pop classic that pops-up in the middle--sticking out like a sore thumb now that it is essentialy a classic). If you like nineties Brit-pop like Blur or Oasis, you'll probably find this interesting as an influential album; and it does have that mid-sixties feel and attitude for those that like the classics, but really, it's a bit overrated. It's a nice, but unassuming album. The cover art is really cool, and helps make this album a somewhat worthwhile purchase."
2,Not the best!,"I'm not one to leave reviews, but i felt i should here. i did not hate this product but it didnt work for me. it smells good and thats it. i see no change in my tan after almost a week. its almost like this stuff blocks the tanning bed. lol i would not recommend it."
3,Mixed bag of early material,"This collection is one of several bootlegs of early J-5 (pre-Motown) material. There are better collections out there and this set is for historians only. The first few tracks are doctored versions of the tunes from thier Steeltown records days. However, the second half is fascinating (albeit low in actual entertainment value) in that it contains undoctored original tapes of the J-5 rehearsing along with some studio clowing during the Steeltown sessions of 1967-68. A couple of songs have Papa Joe Jackson on guitar jamming with his sons (no threat to Jimi Hendrix here).Overall, this reminds you of some kids having fun with a tape recorder singing the popular songs of the day. It's unlikely that this was originally considered for release, but it's interesting for historical documantation."
5,A classic,"This album is destined to become a classic. It's great to see an artist break out of the ""canned music factory"" and release music that is theirs and theirs alone. I had never heard Shelby Lynne and bought this album simply because of two great reviews. It is phenomenal and should do well on the pop, country, and R&B charts. - Going to Memphis to record the strings was a stroke of inspiration. That sound makes the album. Every cut is different AND good. While listening to it, one can hear 60s soul influences all the way to Skynyrd-type stomp. The varied choice of instruments is brilliant. It's great that another Bobbie Gentry-type singer/songwriter is doing so well. (By the way, where is BG?) This album should definitely win a Grammy."
1,Awful waste of my money,I'd give it 0 stars if that were possible. This CD is terrible - boring - just bought it - getting rid of it. I have her older CD's and they're great. This is awful. To the used CD store I go to get rid of it - hopefully I'll forget how bad I think it is and just remember her older good music.
5,Great Album,"This is the third Shelby Lynne cd that I have bought. She has been categorized as a country singer, but this is a mis-classification. She is more of a retro pop almost jazz performer, but she defies easy labelling. To me this is her best cd to date. The songs are varied and each has its own unique appeal. A more than worthy addition to any music library!"
2,Not worth a purchase. Rent it from Netflix.,"Some great players. Excellent sax work by Kirk Whalum, earlier in his illustrious career.Poor quality video and audio but the performance is from 1985 so it's understandable.A short set of 5 tunes.I should have checked Netflix first as it's worth a viewing, but not a purchase."
4,Paul the Apostle,"Great acting, pleasing visually, with well developed characters. There are some major problems: first, there is nudity (a man's rear and a womans breasts) which is totally unnecessary, and ruins the movie for all those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. Secondly, the portrayal of Pentecost is awful (reading the first couple chapters of Acts shows a powerful sermon with many people coming to repentance, where in this movie the message has no power, and only one person comes forward to ask how they can be saved). There are, ofcourse, many other problems, but that is to be expected, unfortunately.It is still enjoyable to see the tension between the Christians and the Pharisees/Saducees, the interplay between the apostles, and Paul teaching and preaching to the Gentiles. The Anthony Hopkins version entiltled ""Peter and Paul"" is far superior, however."
4,Highly impressive,"What a delight to be able to actually ""read"" a book on VBA.The writer is lucent and accessible and does not try to con you into the belief that VBA is a 15 hr.learning curve. Explanations are clear and the text will serve as an excellent reference source for years to come.Watch out Mr Spreadsheet/Mr Excel here is a writer who not only knows her subject inside out but is able to impart this knowledge in a painless fashion that others simply cannot!"
5,A Very Clear and Concise Book,"This is one of the easiest to follow technical books I have ever read. It is very well thought out and structured. I will look for more books by this author. The explanations are clear and concise without being wordy and redundant. The instructions are thorough. Again, without being redundant. I give it five stars, without hesitation."
2,A big disappointment,"I was sorely disappointed with this book. The premise is really interesting and in fact, the case studies are worth reading. However, Stiffler has basically quoted the works of others without giving any real insights to these studies. This book is not really meant for the average lay person, it uses very specific language of psychology which I imagine most people have not trained in. Being an academic myself, I do not have issue with this, but as an adoptee trying to find a concise analysis of coincidences in reunion, this book was sincerely disappointing. I do hope that Stiffler will reassemble the book for future readers."
3,"A lot of math, hard to get a conceptual understanding","I'm a graduate student beginning in Attitude Determination and Control, of a small Cubesat, using magnetic torque coils.I had ordered a set of books to educate myself on the topic. This book is not helping me identify the problem and the thought process towards the solution as I hoped.I imagine I will find it useful later when I am looking for the math to quantify the problem, but for now I dont think I can ""learn"" from only it."
5,Great Edition,"One of the most important books in all of math.And when there is a diagram, and you need to turn the page,the diagram is copied on the next page too,so you don't need to keep flipping back and forth.what more must be said?"
3,"Nice, but....","This high chair is fine all around. It's a little tight moving the parts at first, but once you do it a few times, they move fine. The only issue I have with this chair is that my son gets his arms caught between the tray and the chair back. If he puts his arm to the side, it slides between the tray and the side of the chair back and he can't get it out again and his arm becomes red. While I keep moving it out, he still does it constantly. I don't know if this is an issue with other chairs or if he were large enough to have the tray pushed further away from him (he is very tall and thin) it wouldn't be an issue, but it is for us now. Just a warning for those who plan to look at it in the store, try your baby in it."
1,Alarm doesn't work,"Slick watch alarm doesn't work. Seller very helpful, offers to resend item. But no thanks"
5,Love the Stir Fry,I've been a fan of this traditional stir fry for over 20 years. Its hard to find but was thrilled to see it listed here in Amazon.
1,classic tv westerns without singing cowboys pls,sorry I just like to find some classic tv western bundles without singing cowboys.especially when their epesodes are half of the bundle.100 Greatest Western Classics - Western Classics + Western Legends
2,Broken less than a year after purchase - trying to find warranty info,"I received this coffeemaker for Christmas 2005. It worked great through July 2006 and then it started making a buzzing sound when the dial was turned from off to on. Turning it off and on again would fix the problem. However, a month later I realized that the coffeemaker was no longer turning off. I'd make coffee in the morning and then hours later would add water to make tea and the water would steam. The dial was in the off position. Unplugging it was the only way to get the coils to cool.One good feature of this coffeemaker is that it keeps the coffee hot for several hours. I wouldnt buy another one of these but I'll be sure to get one with the thermal carafe."
1,get ready for the worst 51.4 minutes of your life. seriously.,"I don't know what the other reviewers are thinking. This is the worst abomination of hip hop since reggaeton. This is generic spoon-fed crap brought to you courtesy of your local radio. It is not good, it is not original, and if you think it is you are in need of serious rehabilitaion or you are completely ignorant of actual quality music. I pray that if you have had the misfortune of listening to this album that you downloaded it, so these talentless, usurping, music [...] didn't make any money."
4,The new revolution is here!,"I just came to know about Flipsyde after seeing the 'Spun' video and it seemed quite a good deal.After reading a couple of good reviews on Amazon.com,I bought the album.They're truly having a distinctive style of music-totally unlike all those similar and rather boring raps... As other reviewers point out, this is the only field where some other good bands like Linkin Park and Aerosmith have experimented and have found victory like what Flipsyde is enjoying now.Flipsyde is a completely new revolution! Lets give way to this new wave..."
2,Excellent International Drug Guide Reference,"To those wishing to update an old version of their PDR, Mosby's 2004 Drug Guide may be what you are looking for. All of the brand name drugs are listed in alphabetical order in the front section of the book. To the man who stated that Abilify and Strattera are not listed, I must say to him, ""Look again.""I agree with the last reviewer that this book takes some getting used to since there are two sections in the front listing brand name drugs. Only the first section, up to page 88 need to be referenced. The following pages list only the brand name drugs in other countries.Most of us are conditioned to believe that foreigners can speak only their own language. Not true, since many medical professionals were students in the Western world.All in all, Mosby's Drug Guide is an international reference guide for all persons in the medical field."
3,A Fair Book,"This book was fair. I expected a lot more on Steve Wynn: The Casino King. In addition, I felt the author tried very hard to portray him in a negative light. Therefore, it had a biased approach.Overall, I think that this book should be skimmed through quickly."
4,A different point of view,"At one point the author mentions that the only things that modern people have had to give up in oreder to have better health, education, etc. are ""quiet and natural beauty"" It occurs to me that these two things may be essential to human happiness - maybe more important than good dental care or the Internet. I would like to see a book written on that topic."
1,Find something you know a little something about.,Easterbrook knows as much about having a better life as he does about football. Not much. However the book is the perfect gift for insomniacs.
1,THE PROGRESS PARADOX,Complete waste of money the most pathetic book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Please save your money and do not purchase this book
5,Good news is good stuff.,"Check out a podcasts on the book on EconTalk.No matter how optimistic you think you are, you will more than likely find yourself feeling a little defensive and suspicious at some of the statistics that he sites. And these are all GOOD NEWS statistics!Of course, if you keep reading, you'll find yourself relieved to find some bad news in there as well.But the whole book does give some great perspective."
1,Sharing self-delusion,"This book illustrates the sad fact of publishing today, namely that once an author gets established, he can get anything published. This book is very light on original thinking and useful analysis, and for most people is way off the mark because the author is not in touch with reality. The author clearly buys into the contemporary culture of compulsive consumption and supports suburban sprawl with its land use gluttony."
3,Interesting with a notedly Masonic tinge,"This is a thought provoking yet reptitive work. It is already well known that Pythagoras spent time in Egypt so it is logical to assume that he learned some of his mathematics there. I denoted a particularly Masonic ""tinge"" early in the book and this was confirmed when the author compared Socrates to a Master Mason. I thought this a bit of a stretch, but some Masons want to be able to trace the history of their society back to ancient times. Afrocentric and Eurocentric are only terms, not always diametrically opposed. But what about ""humano-centric""?"
5,The pivotal work uncovering the birth of civilization.,"Though I knew that virtually everything taught me in school while growing up was wrong, Stolen Legacy gave me a resource from which to find truth. When Mr. James demonstrated that it was impossible for one man, Socrates, to have written as many books as have been ascribed to him and that in order for a civilization to have time to dabble in philosophy it must have internal and external stability and peace, I knew that the legacy credited to the Greeks was in fact the legacy of the Black Woman and Man of the Nile. Even the Greeks themselves admit their knowledge came from the Blacks in Egypt. This is one of the most important books every published since Mr. Lincoln's military draft document that allowed the North to arm Black soldiers, namely the Emancipation Proclamation."
1,Good idea gone wrong,"I found the 2.1 version (the latest version) slow and inflexibile. It actually produced the wrong answers for my health insurance policies and the results could not be adjusted manually. Also found the ""Help"" section far from helpful although on-line assistance was responsive (although unable to make it right). I think Intuit just got this program into the market too quickly without proper testing."
4,nice introduction,"Gets you started with a lots of short examples. After reading this you'll probably want Advanced RenderMan, but this is a far easier introduction to the RenderMan world."
2,"Poorly produced, rushed to market","This book should have never been published in suchhaste. The author lightly grazes on important topics,offering just tidbits but nothing significant. Very few peopleuse the C API, I don't see any point in wasting space on this.The images are terrible, lack detail, hard-to-follow and most are in black and white. The 'Suggested Activities', 'Summary'and 'Related Commands' sections at the end of each chapter are a joke and are merely page fillers. Surprising that Springer-Verlag would let such a low quality publication slip through."
1,Auguste Rodin: The Hands of Genius - Art and Splendor Series,This item is NOT a biograhy but a catalog of his works. I was very dissappointed because I was hoping it would offer insight into the MAN and his work. I guess I will have to seek that information from another source.
2,So out of date I could cry,"There is nothing on this computer that isn't 2 years old.800 MHZ G4. Not exactly a state of the art cpu.256 MB of 133 MHZ SDRAM, man when is Apple going to finally move over to at least 266MHZ DDR SDRAM? Most PCs are using memory 2-5 times faster than this!Geforce 4 MX as someone already mentioned this is just an ancient Geforce2 with a shiny new name.In fact I just checked and the cheapest (new) PCs on Amazon, the ones that cost less than five hundred, have newer, faster components than this! I've been waiting to upgrade my Mac for two years now so I could switch to OS X. I am begining to think my next computer isn't going to be an Apple."
2,The Holy Bible: illuminated family edition,"The illustrations are beautiful, and I like the St. James version, but the paper is thin and book is not as sturdy as I would have liked. Would be good for everyday use and then replaced when worn out. Not one I would keep as a family ""treasure""."
3,Good technique but NO ENGLISH!,Unfortunately they failed to mention there's no english dialogue or subtitles. While the techniques are interesting english would have been a big help in understanding certain moves.
5,The product info above is incorrect,"This was not directed by Don Warrener; Don Warrener teaches martial arts in Ontario, Canada.If this DVD is from before WWII (as it says in the title), Don Warrener hadn't been born. If (as it says in the description), it is from the 1970s, it is almost certainly the film ""Kosen Judo"", widely available on video sites and produced (I believe) by the Kodokan."
5,Good sleeper documentary,"Having just finished watching this, I was surprised how emotionally vested I became in it. Because of the lack of music, drama, and cinematography, it gave the film a honest feel. I was surprised how one incident of abuse could haunt both of the sisters. I was also surprised that the pervert had never faced any jail time! Worth watching, it challenges what one thinks about how to deal with the whole situation and hopefully, how far we have come?"
5,Aftermarket Honda radiator cooling fan motor.,"This item works just the same as the original Honda part, but at a fraction of the price. Fits and functions the same as the original."
4,saving electricity,"the dial to set the temperature is not accurate. its off close to 6 degrees even after adjusting it like the directions say. once we figured out how much we needed to over compensate for, works like a charm!! perfect chest freezer now fridge. keeps temperature right for fridge usage."
4,Homeopathic Pizza,"An unwed mother risks her baby's life by placing him in the bathtub and to see if he can swim. She then stands by while he drinks all of the water in the tub and eats the soap, stopping him only when he attempts to eat the bathtub itself (an effort which, fortunately for all concerned, fails).She then defies all conventional medical advice and treats him with ... pizza. Admittedly, this is more attractive than either penicillin or castor oil, but still borders on parental negligence.Fortunately, this all goes above the head of the average toddler, who will enjoy the rhyming and the goofy pictures. And the pizza!Recommended."
4,"Solid, positive Hip-Hop/R & B Fusion from A Tribe Called Quest's DJ","Ali Shaheed Muhammad has been in the public eye for over twenty years as the DJ for A Tribe Called Quest, and he has evolved from 'the guy who stands behind the MC's with headphones on' to a full fledged musician/producer. After co-founding and recording an album for the R & B group Lucy Pearl with Raphael Saadiq (formerly of Tony! Toni! Toné!) and Dawn Robinson (formerly of En Vogue), Shaheed returned to his 'roots' so to speak, with Shaheedullah & Stereotypes. Like many DJ/Producers who go solo, Ali rhymes on many of the albums tracks, and the majority (if not all) of the tracks have a positive vibe to them. This is a hip hop album that you can share with your kids and still nod your head to it; a rarity in this day and age. Four stars."
1,Incompatibility,"I was directed to this site when I entered query for my HP Pavilion N 5350 Notebook. I replaced one 128MB chip with two 256MB chips. My computer just beeped intermittently when I turned it on. I'm back to the drawing board. I must pay return shipping because the ""reason for return was not the fault of the vendor."" The memory should be guaranteed!"
1,Seems pointless to even sell this,"Every review I read said this didn't work in Dell laptops, well you can add Toshiba laptops to the list as well. Even though the specs are identical, PC100, 144 pin, SODIMM, unbuffered, non ECC, etc. I snapped it in and booted and Windows wouldnt boot. Pulled it out and the laptop ran fine. Was trying to save the customer some money but don't bother, just get the OEM for your machine."
1,Crap. Crud. Trash,"Look elsewhere. Specs looked correct for my laptop. bought 2. Laptop would not turn on with one of them and the other brought me to a ""please remove incompatible memory"" screen. I should have listened to the other reviews. Amazon. Why are you still letting this seller sell this? Is it the restocking fee you get?"
2,It did not work,"Although it says this DIMM is ""for notebooks"", it didn't work on mine. I have a Dell Latitude CPx J and even when the sistem recognized the new memory, Windows didn't start. So I had to take it off and still working with the old DIMM."
3,useful sound sfx,"this cd has a lot of useful stuff on it , like the happy b-day song for partys, dj tools, and you can learn stuff about setting -up and test your sound system"
1,*** Don't be FOOLED ***,"First of all, I received this item OPENED.They actually used scotch tape to reseal the plasticbubble over the cardboard....jeez!NO TIP for the iron is included, even it is shown inthe picture.Spend you money somewhere else."
3,"Good music, but vocals need boosting!","I've listened to this CD a lot lately, Failure has some good songs on here. ""Submission"" is catchy and dissonant at the same time, ""Macaque"" has some really interesting lyrics and a solid sound, ""Screen Man"" is a good slow song, with excellent guitar and bass work, ""Muffled Snaps"" has an awesome middle section of an interesting and full guitar sound. Almost all the songs on this album are good, BUT I found myself going to look up the lyrics for every single song, because the vocals were so quiet in the mix. On ""Muffled Snaps"" I was barely aware that he was singing at all until the distortion kicked in. Overall good album, but If you want to get into Failure, go listen to Fantastic Planet or Magnified."
2,"Is it the windows version, or what?","Bought the IPOD for xmas. Opened it up after letting it sit for a couple of weeks to try to convince myself it was worth the price. Not crazy about the way the downloads take place, but after you work out the nuances, downloads work pretty well. I've read the reviews about how reliable the player is, that it doesn't freeze up like windows computers do. Guess mine is the exception that makes the rule. I have the IPOD for Windows and it freezes up all the time. When I use it for long walks at a brisk pace, I'm constantly having to reset. On today's 1 1/2 walk, it froze up on me 4 times. I love being able to carry all that music, but if this is a persistent problem, I'm going back to the mini-disk."
5,Doesn't get much better than these!,"Gone through thousands of these with not one read or write failure! They're a bit more expensive, but worth every penny!"
1,verbatim 16X DVD,I was not satisfied at all. I was looking for Light scribe DVD's & this was listed under that category. When the order came in I contacted Media Supply in order to return the product. Still to this date nobody has responded to my email.
5,non-stop action.,This is the best book by Wilbur Smith. The suspense is incredible. I could not put it away. RECOMMENDED!
5,Yea Wilbur Smith!!,"I agree with all the other positive responses. He is a great writer, along with Clive Cussler, who WAS my favorite!!. Can't wait to read another!"
2,very disappointing for Wilbur Smith,"I am a big Wilbur Smith fan having read many of his novels. But this one is not up to his normal standard. It was full of adventure but very very gorey and bloody. Much too much graphic violence for me. It is a story set around finding sunken treasure. Being a scuba diver, I thought it would be a fun read. But the scuba detail is very inaccurate. References to the bends and dangerous animal encounters that really don't happen that way. Plus the kindle conversion was full of bad text with many I's as 1 and some other words wrong made it distracting to read on Kindle. Skip this one."
2,It Locks Up and Shots down the PSP,"I have been waiting so long for a patch for this game, i guess i will have to take it back to amazon and get something else, I liked the game it was an old test of d&d but it locks up when i fight the 4 flying angels. EVERY time. I am stuck there and it shuts the machine right off. anyone else do this? There are no scratches. i wonder if the game disk is just bad or is it the game in genral? I never find anyone else online either"
4,Peace on the home front!,"I love these wireless headphones! They work great and you can move from room to room and still hear the program. Due to the fact that the shows I like and the volume I listen to them is a huge bone of contention in our house, Their are less disagreements! It has soothed the tiger and empowered the watcher! Great purchase, easy to hook up and nice clear sound! Buy it you won't be sorry!"
4,Good Product,"This unit are very comfortable to use for many hours and provide a excellent sound quality, most of time. The wireless range is good for small houses or apartments. The charge base is amazing and works perfectly.The only problem I found that with it, is that frequently i hear interference noise, but it's probably caused by some other devices working at the same frequency."
1,Defective Out of the Box,"I own many Sony products, (HDTV, Audio Receiver, CD Carosels, Digital Cameras)I was very disappointed with this product. The first unit was defective out of the box. The replacement unit was also defective. I returned both units for credit and would never buy another Sony headset again."
5,Sony Headphones,"This product worked much better than the RCA one. It charges very easily through electromagnetic induction, and it turns on once it is placed over your head. The stand is very sleek and nice with less cords than other models. There is some static but overall for the price it is an excellent buy"
2,Good sound but breaks easily,"I've bought several of these wireless headphones because I enjoy walking around and/or lying in bed while listening to TV. Compared to other headphones, the sound quality is fine. But the reason I keep buying them is because they break too easily. I call it my quarterly tax for listening in comfort."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought these headphones about two weeks ago. They go back tomorrow.Pros: They are very comfortable and the sound is wonderful. Stereo really stands out.Cons:1. The battery charge function never did work. I left the unit on the charger for 3 days, well past the 16 hours recommended, and the battery pack never did take a charge.2. I used my own batteries for a while. It worked fine - for a little while. Once the cover of the left earpiece was removed to put in my own batteries, it wouldn't stay on. It would pop off at the most inopportune times. The last time sealed the deal. The piece fell behind my wall unit and I had to unload the entire unit to get it.3. Finally, the auto on/off feature failed. It would cut in/out every 2 seconds or so. This drove me nuts. Now the earphones are totally useless.One last thought. This is a very large system. You better have a lot of room."
5,Sony Wireless Headphones,The installation is simple even with newer flatscreen TV's and the sound reproduction is superb. Volume control from the headset allows for others watching a program to adjust the TV volume to their preferences.
1,Just Crap,"I bought these to use when playing my electric guitars. Headphone cords tend to get in the way. This is the worst product I have ever bought from Sony. I have always liked Sony products. With this I am very disappointed. Very low volume, spits and hisses like crazy on all three channels. I tried them with different amplifiers, guitars, stereo and computer. All the same lousy sound, lots of interference and you can't turn them up very loud. Keep looking do not buy this product."
3,Sony MDR-RF92RK 900 MHz Analog RF wireless headphones.,"I have had these about 2 years and they still work great,but they are big headphones.Saying that they are comfortable and light and work great.I can listen to music loud and walk around.Good range on them. Also listening to movies.B uy them!!!"
1,Don't bother,"No idea how this product gets good reviews. All the secondary attributes are great: convenient charging cradle, reversible cable, reasonably light, decent sound quality (when you can hear it).But I bought these to use at work, and the interference made them absolutely unusable. From a mild ever-present hissing sound, to regular, loud, annoying feedback, the interference was, in no uncertain terms, brutal. We have one rarely-used wireless access point at work, and when I tested them at home they weren't much better. For the first time ever, I returned a product because it plain didn't work."
2,disappointed in quality,"We are very disappointed with the sound quality of these Sony headphones. There is a constant static ""buzz"" when using these headphones. I now wish I had spent the extra money and purchased the TV Ears brand, as my friend did and is quite happy with them."
1,BEWARE!! DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES,"I bought these headphones less than a year...and they have malfunctioned. First, only one cuff will produce sound, then after another month past the other cuff went dead. The problem with the product is that it doesn't respond to channel signals and tuning signals. Both cuffs won't emit a sound. It's a weak product. Sony's warranty only covers after 90 days. So, if your problem was bought 120 days or more, you will have to get it Serviced by Sony or a replacement BUT the cost to replace is very similar to the original price of the item. I bought these for $99 and now, telling me that the Sony replacement will cost $43.00 (almost half the the original cost). Plus, they have to troubleshoot the product before they initiate a service agreement. This is alot of CROCK!! This is burdensome for the consumer. If you are thinking about SONY---think about so other brand, but not this one. I do not recommend!!"
2,giblet,I purchased this and paid over 80 dollars and was very hopeful with a Sony product. When it arrived even though the headset is a bit heavier than I wanted they are very comfortable. I found that there is a constant popping and crackling sound whenever the headset is used. The popping and crackling sound happened no matter if you are close to or far from the aerial. I also found that if you are more than 20 feet from the aerial the hissing sound is so horrid I would never use it for music. I tried the aerial in many locations near I even extended the aerial cord far from any electronics but this did not help the problem. I am very disappointed in this Sony product and would never recommend any one buy it if they are looking for high quality sound.
1,No good,"I purchased this headset thinking I would get crystal clear sound since it's a Sony brand. However, after using this product for almost 6 months I am highly dissatisfied. I purchased a pair of wireless headsets from Radio Shack back in 2004 and they lasted 6 years with perfect crystal clear sound. This headset does not compare to the Radio Shack quality. Three channels of pure distortion. Do not buy"
2,WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN,"Has a cracking sound whenever you move your head,doesn't hold charge very long,I do not recomemd you buy these headphones."
2,Not Great...,Lots of noise and the popping is really distracting. I tried some of the fixes in other posts to no avail. Very heavy item and somewhat uncomfortable.
1,unacceptable level of noise,The popping and clicking noise is unbearable. I'm very disappointed at this Sony product.So why do some people give five-star rating? They don't have this problem??? Or just can't trust some of the online reviews.
3,Disappointed,"I thought this would be my answer to understanding the words spoken while watching TV. It is to a point, however, I am unable to put the volume up enough. I so have hearing aids but that doesn't solve the problem."
1,when did ears become round,"Why are ear pieces round? I don't know about other people, but my ears are not round. I find round earphones to be pretty uncomfortable. I spend a lot of time on our tractor, bush hogging or mowing hay, or whatever and I always end up wearing my old but reliable and COMFORTABLE (because they have nice roomy, oval well padded ear pieces) noise reducing Koss Headphones. I guess they don't make them like they used to, or maybe people have evolved TINY ROUND ears! Really?? Anyway I just wanted to see how many people have evolved tiny round ears. I must have noise reducing headphones so if any one has any suggestions on brands besides $300.00 and up Bose, please let me know. Also I absolutely hate that thin not leather stuff they cover earphones with. When you wear it it makes you sweat and then you end the working day covered with bugs, weeds, and funky black ears. So if anyone has any ideas, let me know."
1,Hotel,We cannot get into watching this movie. it is to convoluted to keep up with. Should have a negative rating system for this one.
2,failed to be a horror novel,"I expected it to be oooh so evil and scary, but I read it late at night and I didn't feel any chill at all. It wasn't what I expected it to be. I expected it to be so evil that I couldn't go to sleep at night and would have images in my head, but no... I found it quite funny."
4,"An Easy, Fast, and Fun Read!","I read this book in about a day and a half. It's a lot shorter than most King books. However it's very good, and is ALOT better than Insomnia. It's freacky and thought provokng. This was is not that scary so you can read it at night."
3,Ehh....,"I LOVE Stephen King and Dean Koontz novels, but I have to admit that Carrie was pretty dissapointing. It was his first novel, and you can tell by its sloppiness. It hardly seems like the same author. I had to force myself to press on at times and the whole pig farm scene was disgusting. Those kids were truly dispicable, so much so that I was turned off. It's just a VERY mediocre book compared to the likes of Misery, Rose Madder, Pet Sematary, and The Shining. Outdated and overrated, and just not very good."
5,Astounishing debut,"In my opinion this book is still one of Stephen King's best. Simple idea, unexpected plot, excellent automosphere, direct horror. This book reads like a true story indeed, so many documents and scenes are so vivid and you wonder whether it is merely fabulous or not. Via this book Stephen King tell us he is a born story-teller. BTW, After reading over 10 of King's books, I must say that I still love his early direct, earnest style rather then the recent psychological, sinuous, over-embellished one."
4,"I found this book, remarkably enjoyable.","I found this book remarkably enjoyable. I found it acually fun to read, and for a 14 year old, that was important. I think that this book wasn't the best book I ever read, but I found that I was looking forward to reading a couple more pages in this book whenever I could. I think that I liked reading this book for a couple reasons, but the only one that I can think of right off the top of my head, would be because of how it was written, with a certin flare, it was written with energy, and that energy rubbed off while reading this book. I recomendit to friends, and I recomend it to you."
4,Carrie,"Absolutely loved the description in the book. The story was slow in some parts and the style was much different than King's later books, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the read."
4,"Not his best, but quite scary if you ask me!","CARRIE is the third novel I've read by Stephen King. The other two are BAG OF BONES and THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I liked CARRIE the least of all those books, but it was definitely a fast and sacry read. Margaret White, Carrie's mother, was very cruel and entertaining and the newspaper articles and interviews are intriguing and fun to read. CARRIE was also a good book because it wasn't long at all and the dialogue and writing was easy to comprehend. The greatest characters are Sue Snell and Tommy, the best people King ever thought up in his creative head. CARRIE was fine by my entertainment standards!!!"
4,Gory Story,"This is a pretty good, short, and gory book. I finished it very fast and loved it. It is about a High School girl with telekinesis. She is unliked and at her school, until she is asked to go to the Prom with a very popular guy. She thinks it is a trick, but he gets her to do it. They are voted King and Queen of the Prom and everything is going great until they play a bad trick on her. She unleashes her power and soon the whole city is in ruins.I recommend it, it is a quick book. I was a little dissapointed, but I guess I was expecting too much."
3,Carrie made you think if King is really so damn good.,"This is the type of book that you really think about. I mean sure it was King's first novel, but still, before I knew it the book was already over. But I think, beyond all, Carrie was a great novel, not as good as The Tommyknockers or Insomnia, but still a great novel. Let me give you a brief summary. I mean a real brief summary, the story was very short. A girl named Carrie has telekenetic powers, and she's out there to destroy anyone who ever said a word about her. Hell, she's out there to destroy her whole highschool. I think DePalma did a great job directing the movie in comparison with Kubrick directing The Shining."
3,"King's first novel, but it still reels you in.","It's been years since I read Carrie, and I recently decided to read it again. Yes, it's King's first novel, and yes, you can tell it is. Putting that aside, he still had the power to suck the reader into his world like he aways does. I wouldn't recommend Carrie for someone about to read King for the first time, but it's a great book for long time fans wanting a reminder as to why King is the master of macabre."
4,teenage angst,"Really enjoyed reading this book, could not believe how accurately Stephen King depicted the mind set of a sheltered teenage girl. I was expecting a good read, but this far exceeded my expectations. Cannot wait for the film adaptation with Chloe Moretz."
4,Carrie,"The book i read was Carrie by Stephen King. The book was a little difficult to read... It was pretty much about a girl named Carrie was a misfit and school and she always got picked on. Her home life didn't help either, her mom was a jesus freak. Her mother didnt teach her alot so when she got he period in gym class she had no clue what was going on cause no one had told her. So you could probably understand how confused this poor girl was.Some of the popular people thought it would be funny to make a big seen at the prom! So the most popular guy asked her out to the prom . the girl was so excited and on top of everything she won prom queen. But when she went to get the crown the spilled pigs blood all over her. Thats how it all started she started going all crazy . All in all i was a really good book it is very true to life, othere then the end, i recomend this book for anyone who would like scary books."
4,One of the best coming of age revenge books,"As a man who lived in a house full of women, and author ofTrue Monsters (The Shepherds Wolf), I know second hand about the social pressures that happen to a high-school girl. Considering this excellent contemporary novel is written by a man who had never gone through high-school as a woman, I found it made teen females a little more understandable.Is it the definitive experience? Of course not. It's a S.E. Hinton novel mixed with Robert Bloch.It is a gripping, and nuanced piece of work written by a man at the start of his career, and his life.Would Stephen King written this kind of novel today, post accident, information-age saturated culture? Maybe. But it would be a very different novel, and as such should become part of English reading curriculum, if only for an example of the lifestyle's of teens living in a different era."
3,Carrie Review,"Stephen Kings ""Carrie"" is about a middle class teenager who is sheltered by her extremely religous mother and lives her entire life as a social outcast. King opens the book with a scene where Carrie is humiliated in front of all of the girls in her gym class. Events like this continually happen to Carrie, she is always the target of jokes, and is humiliated repeatedly. Eventually, Carrie explodes and takes revenge against her mother, her peers, and the entire town of Chamberlain. King accurately shows the horror and sadness of the life of a social outcast, and how these things lead to the tragedy of Chamberlain, Maine."
2,The Reader's Digest Guide to Polyamory,"Nothing in this book is wrong or out of place, but it's instantly obvious that it's written by a poet and not a prose artist. I personally feel this book has a far greater economy of words than the topic deserves. It's an addition to the books on polyamory which is a rapid, easy read-but left me wanting more. More explanation, more details, more mechanics."
4,Good Polyamory Basics,"This is one of the newer texts on polyamory. The author does a good job giving a pragmatic, down-to-earth perspective on the subject and it's an easy read, though she abhors the term for some reason and refuses to use it. This strikes me as especially odd since the term now appears in several dictionaries and is familiar even to mainstream America more than any similar term. Still, as a polyamory skills educator I am happy to endorse this book and welcome it as a good addition to the still meager offerings to be had on polyamory. - Anita Wagner"
4,Informative and thougt provoking...,"This was a very quick read. Personally, I enjoyed reading this book. If you are new to the ""Poly"" world or want to inquire about non-traditional ways of maintaining relationships, this book is perfect. My only hang-up with the book was the emphasis on how you can't obtain everything you need from one relationship. I feel you can't depend on other people to satisfy you or stroke your ego. The things you're lacking needs to be filled within you, not by someone else. You can't rely on people to validate you or your feelings; it is your own responsibility to find validation and happiness within yourself. Overall, I would recommend this book to a friend."
4,Fun with Agility,I really like this book - it is very informal and has great ideas. I just wish it had more information on how to make your own equipment. Don't want to compete with my dog - we just want to have some fun and this book has been a great help.
3,Good,I bought two of these and one went bad after about two months.But with the great customer service here at amazon it was replaced without question.Amazon has the best customer service!!!!
3,It's Never Too Late Literacy Institiute - Jada and Jean,This is an excellent book to teach students about various artist that have had an impact in the world of art. The art work is absolutely gorgeous if art is your choice. Many young students willlike the variety in the choice of black and white photos as well asart choices the author has choosen to use. There are excellent illustrations of times past and present and different cultures and customs. We would highly recommend this book to teachers who also teach art.
5,Never forget,When I was about six years old an art organization came to my school to teach kids about fine art. It was something different every day. The day we learned about Claude Monet I fell in love with art. They used Linnea as a teaching tool. I asked my mom to go to every museum we could after that. I still have a small version of one of his paintings from the first museum I ever went too. Now I go to art school and I'm surrounded my wonderful painters and drawing artists everyday. I can thank Linnea for introducing me to fine art and sparking my love for Monet.
4,1971 was a good year :o),"OK, I'll try to sum up this CD in a nutshell:Rod Stewart meets Peter Green sung by the Black Crowes with Robert Plant pulling the strings and Jimmy Page nodding along :-PSeriously, these guys obviously liked and were heavily inspired by Early Fleetwood Mac, John Mayall, Genesis, Hendrix, and most oviously Zed Zeppellin. This is not to say they necessarily copy these bands but the influence is definitely there. Enjoyable stuff if that white boy blues-rock sound is your thing. I'm also a sucker for this kind of things and, as this one has two bonus tracks (sound quality is diminished but they are surely listenable), I was hooked :o)"
3,An Uninspiring Discussion of the Compatibility of Science and Faith,"I like the concepts and arguments shared by Polkinghorne, an eminently qualified author on the relationship of faith and science; however, I found the book uninspiring. It is something of a table-talk style of discussion that I think fails to delve deeply into the topics. Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest and physicist, writes how he believes in the big bang, evolution and in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.He makes some good and interesting points about how it is the most natural thing for a scientist to be a believer in God, and he shares arguments for the acceptance of miracles and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I think at best this book is an introduction into the topics."
5,I feel like I grew up with these characters!,"Ernest Hill has done it again! He REALLY has his finger on the pulse of the 70's and 80's south. Just as with ""A Life For A Life"" I found myself searching my memory for people who matched these characters. Cry Me A River is another example of art invading reality. Tyrone tried hard to clear his son. In effect, he sacrificed himself for what he believed was true about his son. How many fathers would do no less? As a father, I felt Tyrone's frustration and anger on the road to clearing his son. This book had me wanting to pick up the phone to actually call the characters. They felt so real and familiar. Excellent, excellent writing. I look forward to his next work!"
2,A Movie that NEVER Gets Going . .,"Frankly, this movie is about as interesting as picking a stranger and following him or her around for a few days, just observing what they do. To make it a bit more interesting, say you followed this person on their vacation. That's it. The only reason I bought this movie is because the DVD cover says it is about a young woman who coaches a young boy on how to behave with girls. [I am fairly sure that I have the world's largest privately owned DVD collection of movies dealing with children and teens - over 4000 so far.] However, that segment is so short in comparison to the rest of the movie, it can't really be said that is what the story is mostly about.The one good aspect of the movie is that much of the acting is so natural that one could think it really was a secretly filmed conversation between two people. For this quality, it could be studied by acting students."
2,hard to stay awake,"it was hard to watch because nothing happened , i had to take a break from it and finish watching it later on, very boring i am from argentina,and like to hear the language and the look at the countryside,that was the only reason i saw it till the end,there was no plot, like home movies"
1,Ana y los otros,"I was excited to receive this movie yesterday so i quickly popped it in the dvd player and watched it to it's conclusion.I thought it might pick up sometime in the middle of the flick.But to my dismay it just dragged on for the entire length of the movie.This would'nt be good as a rental.This useless piece of celuloid was about as much fun as a prostate exam.P.S. If i should ever run out of toilet tissue at home,i can always use this DVD to remedy the problem.If you need more info just e-mail me at nuyorican812@yahoo.com"
1,DVD Tech probs,"As much as I love HIMYM, I have to give this 1 star because of of the problems it gives me when I try to run it. Looks like others are having the same problems with the blu ray version, I'm reporting about the DVD version.When I popped disc 1 in my PS3, it started making a loud humming noise like as if the disc reader went into overdrive, I didn't even attempt to play it. I took it out and tried it again, once again loud humming noise. Not cool.I put it in my PC and tried to run it with Media Player Classic, and it loads the 20th century part but scrambled, then shuts down with a error msg Copy Protect-Fail.Got it to run fine using the latest Windows Media Player thankfully."
5,HIMYM Season 6,"This product was delivered on time and in great condition. This is one of my favorite shows, I now have all 6 seasons on DVD. The price was very reasonable as well compared to Target, Best Buy, etc."
5,This show keeps getting better and better.,This show keeps getting better and better. Need I say more. I felt the fifth season was a little flat but this season will have you rolling around on the floor laughing.
4,"Love this show, but...","... there's no Blu-ray version available. After releasing season 4 in that format, Fox decided to stick it to those who actually like to use our HDTVs for HD content. No Blu-rays for the last two seasons. That's kind of cold, if you ask me. But it's still currently my second favorite show on TV and the flatter standard def DVDs are better than nothing."
4,"Disturbing, thought provoking. Not my favorite, but solid.","Here's the question that is so disturbing in The Servants of Twilight. Can you serve evil without knowing it? Can you be good and strong and pure and yet find your goodness helping evil?Koontz seems to say yes in this novel. To me, that left a bad taste that lasted for days. Yet great literature should be thought provoking, and he succeeds in doing just that. Who says deep philosophical questions cannot be raised by so-called commercial fiction?"
1,Keep your Kindle e-books totally separate from your paper books.,I was trying to download a Kindle version of this book. I was on my Kindle home page on your site. I inadvertantly ordered two paper backs of this book because being on the Kindle search page I thought I was ordering Kindles. Shortly after ordering them I tried to stop the shipment. But I was denied the ability to stop them. I didn't like that...if you are going to have a Kindle search page stick to Kindle!
3,very lightweight,says it is for cutting wire of a certain guage but I would keep it to very soft metal if you cut metal at all. I cut 20ga sterling wire and leaves a bit of a ridge cause the cutting edges of the cutter do not align properly.
1,Blade broke.,"Blade snaped the first day of use. I was using this product to cut 20 gauge craft wire. The tip of the cutting blade snapped right off. The product description says that it ""Cuts ACSR, screws, nails and most hardened wire. Shears wire up to 14AWG"". This is NOT the outcome I thought I would have with this tool."
3,Deliciously dark!,"This is goth indust/dark trance at its darkest. Very aggressive and relentlessly hateful. Monstrous pounding beats, laser synths and mechanically distorted hoarse vocals leaving a bitter solemn aftertaste. It is a tad cliche but these days you have an option of completely dead-end or at least semi-cliched yet promising. It stands out in its own right within a constricting genre - sustaining a strong level of hostility and stubborn pessimism towards humanity, evoking a droning ominous atmosphere yet it's also very trance-like and distantly blissful. Every track is a strong damnation anthem which doesn't romanticise over morbid fascination- it's explicitly resentful and ideal for when you want to shut yourself out from civilisation, lost in unconscious thoughts.Although, one thing I will say is that pretty much all the tracks sound the same - so it does become boring."
4,Almost really great,"Mr. Boyle is a talented writer with a flair for detail. And in Jack McMorrow, he has created a character I care about and relate to. I appreciate the way the tension builds on a slow upward grade to a clash at the end in both this novel and in his first McMorrow effort, 'Deadline.' All the while, Boyle paints a vivid picture of New England that makes me long to live there. Having concocted such a likable protagonist as McMorrow, however, Boyle tends to let him sit in rather the same fashion the owner of an expensive car keeps it off the road for fear of damaging it. Tightening up his plots and giving his characters a little more to do, would to my mind, make Mr. Boyle's fiction worthy of more 5 star, instead of 4 star reviews."
1,Don't Buy This Version,This Korean edition is terrible. The original German soundtrack doesn't even match the actors' lip movements. Entire scenes are missing such as most of the duel sequence. The English subtitles have errors in them. Save your money.
2,No disrespect to Joe Strummer but...,"This is the only album I own of Joe Strummer minus The Clash. I can't say it's very good. I hate having to compare it with it with his work with The Clash but it's inevitable. His lyrics aren't as great, edgy or provocative. There isn't any fantastic music either. I am not really sure what to say since I haven't listened to the album in so long because it was so bad, I truly tried my hardest to like it. But I feel it is my duty to advise others to not make the same mistake. Believe me: I absolutely love everything about The Clash, the lyrics, Joe's voice, the music, the attitude and how cool they were, this is not Joe at his best, it's cool though cause now he's gone: go buy some Bob Marley albums instead, Joe would not have minded."
3,Don't buy for Kindle,"Love Ambrose Bierce and love this book, but for the 9.99 Kindle price I would expect much better formatting ..or any formatting at all."
2,Not up to Monster reputation and cost,Did not work well on my Samsung led screen. Could not completely remove smudges. I feel that I wasted money by buying the expensive stuff.
5,Great Product,"I have a MacBook Pro and I had (accidentally) sprayed some serious hairspray all over the screen. Nothing else was taking it off, but this spray cleaned it like a champ. It looks like new. Fantastic."
2,Meh......,"I, unlike other reviewers, am NOT a Pynchon fan. I had to read this book for class, and it was terrible. It made no sense at all, and the author's attempts to be clever just backfired."
2,Too all over the map.,I have never read a book that had single sentences running for two thirds of a page until I read this book. This book had no flow do to writers style of writing. I will read a later book by Pynchon before I decide if his style and stories work for me.
2,Is It Over Yet?,"I have this problem that once I commit to reading a book I can't put it down because I think that if I keep reading, maybe, eventually something worth reading will come up in the later pages.This is why I dislike The Crying of Lot 49. The author goes on and on like a crazy hobo in an unending stream of conscious.This book could easily be a short story. It's not subtle at all where the author spends pages and pages over using metaphors and similes, going on tangents and generally trying desperately to fill out what never should have been an entire book in the first place.It took me weeks to finish this short read that should have taken only a few hours because I kept putting it down and eying it like a disenchanted child staring down a plate of vegetables."
3,In Circles,"Like many readers, I must confess that I have difficulty reading ""stream of consciousness"" style writing. For some, this is what makes writers like Pynchon and Joyce hard to read. The run-on sentences make the middle school grammar teacher in me scream out for order. Despite this, I decided to give Pynchon's writing a chance. While I did enjoy the overall story, the presentation was not to my preference.In a series of conspiracies, Oedipa Mass finds herself executor of the estate of her late boyfriend. Not only does she reveal the sources of his wealth, but she also discovers an underground network of conspiracies. Scattered amid historical references, one door of conspiracy leads to another. Dry humor and wit preceed the doors, yet I thought the attempts at humor did not always deliver a payoff.I can appreciate the talent in Pynchon's writing, but I must admit that it is not my cup of tea. It is apparent that his books have a rather devout following, yet his books are not for everyone."
5,This will mess with your head,"""The Crying of Lot 49"" is a metaphysical mystery as well as a hilarious satire. ""The Courier's Tragedy"" is probably the funniest episode I have ever read. However, there is much more to this book than meets the eye. In fact, I'd recommend, after you read it, to go back and re-read it with the help of J. Kerry Grant's Companion. There are many allusions in this work that you probably weren't aware of (I sure wasn't) that make the mystery of the book all the more intriguing. Though it is Pynchon's shortest novel, ""The Crying of Lot 49"" packs enough paranoia into its pages to fill a thousand page epic. This is probably his most accessible book, but do not be fooled: it is no easy read. However, the rewards of it are well-worth the necessary efforts put forth."
2,Not my cup of tea,It was such a chaotic book that it only produces nonsense. It didn't stimulate me intellectually at all. The only scene I thought enjoyable was the encounter between Oedipa and Metzger in the hotel. I laughed out loud.
5,Every word of 'Hiding Place' was written with God's Love,"I thank the Lord in my prayers for bringing Corrie & her family into my life & that of my children, even though it is only through her books. When I first read the book, I went & bought all the other ones by her. At least all the ones I could find. I have grown spiritually and her book has been an inspiration as well as help in some of my personal struggles. No one should miss out. I recommend her books constantly to everyone I know & I use her stories to encourage others as well as witness."
5,One of the best books I've ever read - over and over again,"A book so touching that it leaves a clear and concise message that we are all innocent of the life and circumstances that we are born into. From that moment on we are taught to hate or (hopefully) to love all those that exist in the same world as we, regardless of their or our own circumstances or convictions. Corrie Ten Boom is a true hero...a saint...an angel from God."
1,The Hiding Place,I think this book was a very boring book. About 1/2 way through it started to get better. it gives a good discription of the Holocaust from a different view of things. I feel this book did start to get better but cold not make up for its awful begining. I wouldn't buy this book if I were you.
4,the hiding place,This is a great book. Hard to believe that all this went on during the holocaust. Wonder how they could get through all of this? GOD..got them through..
5,Excellent book,"The Hiding Place, an excellent written true story. It is a great story of concentration camps with Nazi guards during World WarII. The extreme horror of people involved. Corrie Ten Boom, lives a simple life, and with her family habor Jewish refuges in their home. Her belief in God brings hope to others."
2,Not so good,"This book is not very good, but you might like it if you are a very religous person. It has a lot to do with God and beaing thankful for every thing. It's a very slow start and much of it is'nt well written. There's too much foreshadowing. Over all it's ok,but not great."
5,The Hiding Place: Purchased at Amazon.com,"This was such a very moving book. It took me a while to get into it, but it turned out to be a great book. Corrie ten Boom was such a wonderful example of what just one person can do in the face of insurmountable odds. She also did everything with such love, just as the others in her family did. She eventually worked in Germany in various ways after the war and was able to forgive the Germans, everyones bitter enemy. That isn't easy, to forgive somebody. Forgiveness isn't something you can just summon up at will, it takes time. So glad I got to read this book."
4,Wonderful book - not a great copy,"I have only just started the book and have already found one editing error. (There was a comma before a period where there shouldn't have been.) Also, I ordered the book because I read a copy of it at the library and was disappointed to find that it didn't include the introduction like the copy I had already read."
3,The Hiding Place,"This book was a pretty good book. There was good suspence, and good aventure. However, the book got off to a slow start, and had some boring chapters. If you want a book about the Holocaust, but don't want want it to be so graphic, I would suggest this book. The best part in book was when they were planning the secret room, and doing drills for it, and during their stay at some of the prisons. This book has some excitement and lots of entertainment. All and all this was a pretty good book."
3,color not as pictured,"I've bought these sets in two colors, ivory and platinum. Both of sets' colors are darker than the pictures. Platinum is ok, but color of the ""ivory"" is actually light beige and they don't go so well with my white table linnens. Would match cream or beige colored linnens better. And some rings have tiny chips around the edges. I'd expect better quality from Lenox."
1,I Did not like This Movie,"Sometimes i think that people are given money just so that they can be weird-movie makers, especially. I was highly disappointed. This freakish movie had a flimsy plot, not to mention an unbelieveably stupid ending. It starts with serial killing and ends on an off-balanced tangent. Although i understand the strands that they tried to pull together to get their ending-IT WAS STUPID. Try and imagine a mixture of ""forensic detectives"" and ""Friday the Thirteenth-part any"", without the good slasher characteristics. An ""artwork"" this is. I was highly disappointed. The star is for the unbelieveability of this story."
4,"Pure, B-movie cheeseball goodness","Dario Argento's 'Phenomena' is a a gem of a B-movie with enough engaging and entertaining characteristics to make this film well worth your time if you're into such genre novelties. When you have a film that features a monkey sidekick, a crippled scientific genius, an all-girls boarding school in Europe, Jennifer Connelly in her teenage glory, insect swarms, rotting corpses and a few other surprises the question is - what doesn't this film have? One of Argento's more entertaining films and a decent dvd to boot - lots of extras and an above average transfer."
3,All I can remember were her outfits,"I remember seeing the American version of this movie and thinking that whoever designed her cloths was wonderful. Everything else just seemed like a dream with a few 'slasher' film images. I will have to revisit, it has been over 25 years and I have since read enough about the film to see it with different eyes."
4,A solid performance,"I was hoping for a more intimate sound since it was just the two of them with their guitars. But with the venue being what it was, it sounds like their other live albums just without the rest of the band. But they do a good job with the songs. I believe this is the only official release of the extended version of ""Riverside"", so that should be justification enough for America fans to pick up the CD. It also has several other songs not found on any other live CD such as ""Windwave"", ""Baby It's Up To You"", and the classic ""Three Roses"". It is a good album and a must for America fans, but it was just not what I was hoping for."
5,"Boucheron, After Shave Balm","Ever suffer from razor burn? Well, this is one of the best products for that cool, soothing feeling. Furthermore, it is the only balm with a musky, masculine scent that lasts all day. The scent is subtle, persistent, and pleasing to others. Because it is in a balm, it is not overpowering, nor does it linger too long after you've past. I highly recommend it for those days when you really should have changed that razor blade, or your skin is sensitive for other reasons. My grandkids love the scent!"
4,Great hardware but a few bugs in the firmware,"I've had this for a month or so and love thewell-built design, the ease of use, fast firewire connection, etc.in most respects this is the best MP3 player out there.However, the firmware/software for the Windows compatible version is still buggy compared to the Mac version. Once it froze up (nothing on the display when you press the keys) and I had to run Ipod updater to replace the OS, once it froze up and plugging it back into the computer made it work again. An annoyance if you're on the road and lose use of it until you can get back home. An online review at an ipod website also noted these problems. Let's hope the second version of the software fixes these bugs.Update: I read that Ephpod, a free utility available from the website of that name, is a good replacement for the supplied musicmatch software and resolves some of these problems (see review for 20GB model). I've installed it and so far so good."
2,Surprisingly unsatisfying.,"I was really looking forward to this book because it was suggested in Patricia Craige's book, ""Born to Win, Breed to Succeed,"" which is a stellar read if you're looking to breed a line of dogs. This book covered some in the early stages about specifically building a line of dog and what it takes, but detours sharply into generally coverying the physical side of breeding dogs. I don't want to know how to care for a pregnant dam, I wanted to learn about genetics, strategy, etc, but that was barely brushed over."
5,"A ""MUST"" for the show/breeding enthusiast","While some of the puppy-raising recommendations are out-of-date, this book is truly basic to the library of those who truly want to develop a well-informed and all-round reference and education about the world of breeding, raising and showing purebred dogs. I have an original copy, but by all means buy this one new. A GREAT read!"
1,clarify compatibility or remove,The product is supposed to be compatible with Mac OS 10.3.9 or higher. It is only compatible up to 10.6.8 will not work with 10.7 or higher.
2,diablo 2 revision vista,"well the package arrived and was in good shape, was shipped quickly.as for the game there are alot of spots thatdo not show color or show wrongcolors, like in the den.. the floor is green,red blue,white not grey like \it should be. Dont think they did a very good job of redoing this game, becausethese spots are thoughout the game. Game is still fun. but hard tosee at timebecause of the color splotches.william"
4,Good Stuff,"I played Diablo, Diablo II, and the expansion pack. These games are good at what they do, which is provide your character with plenty of things to kill and plenty of stuff to take.There isn't a whole lot of story, and very few subplots. What plot there is totally linear. Neverwinter Nights, or Knights of the Old Republic were more enjoyable for me. But this is still a fine game and I had a lot of fun playing it."
4,Good Game,"This game is very well put together; it is challenging, but not impossible. The graphics are okay for a PC game, but could be improved. This battle chest has everything you need to be successful in the game."
3,book missed the mark,"I purchased the book as a Christmas Gift for an 11 yr old very bright nephew who is fascinated with insects. After reading other reviews it seemed as though the book was written a little more with younger reader in mind. Either I misinterpreted the reviews or overestimated the nephew's interest.He opened it, thumbed through it, was unimpressed, read a little here and there and was further unimpressed, walked away and actually left the book at my house. Had I not inscribed the inside front cover, I would have returned it. One of these days maybe I will read it and post a review from a different prospective. Also, one of these days, I will learn that children, bright or not, prefer toys for Christmas - not books. *sigh*A. Michaels"
5,This album jams!,"I purchased this album on vinyl on whim, and boy was I rocked. I immediately went out and purchased the CD as well. Originally meant to be a solo album for Steve Winwood, he couldn't resist bringing in his pals from the then defunct Traffic. What a treat that he did. From the opening of Glad with its upbeat jazz riffs and groovy piano work, to the desperate vocals in Every Mother's Son, this was three great musicians at their best. Unlike the two previous Traffic albums they were willing to take extended solos, and experiment with more jazz flavor than before (half of the songs clock in at more than 6 minutes). Check out Winwood's piano solo in Empty Pages for proof that the equation works. The album simply rocks for all the right reasons, good songwriting, and even better musicianship. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent blend of rock and jazz,"After thirty years, worth another listen. Just fine music, full of intricacies, energy and fusion. Appeals to a broad range of tastes and evokes memories of a simpler time and college life."
5,Traffic Hits Their Stride,"It's all a matter of taste- I'm not particularly fond of Traffic's first two albums- actually there was a third called Last Exit which was excellent and it was the beginning of the really classic jazzy Traffic sound which could not be attained until Dave Mason left- if you like Dave Mason try Live at the Canteen, it's a wonderful reunion with Dave and the whole band. Anyway, they really hit their stride on this album, it's great folky, jazzy rock. Winwood is as great on guitar as on keyboards. The next album, Low Spark is probably their best (in my opinion) and then they slowly went downhill. If you like this album Blind Faith should also be your cup o'tea."
5,One of the finest albums of all time,"""John Barleycorn"" has in common with much of the Beatles' work that -- even if you've listened to it a thousand times -- when you come back it sounds as fresh and new as the very first listening.The entire album is great--and covers an amazing amount of ""musical territory."" It would be on my short list of nominees for ""greatest album of all time.""Let me also add that I was fortunate enough to see the briefly-reunited Traffic at Columbia, MD's Merriweather Post Pavilion (the year may have been 1994), not too long after the release of their much-underrated ""Far From Home"" - a fine album in its own right. It was a concert for the ages. Among his many other talents, Winwood is a superb guitarist."
5,Majestic and moving this is Traffic's finest hour,"Whittled down to a trio Traffic solidered on with their finest album. Although not as catchy or commerical as their first two studio albums, JBMD captures the trio at their best. The music smoothly moves from folk to jazzy instrumentals without breaking a sweat. Winwood's vocals are among his best here. His impassioned vocals on Every Mother's Son bring the album to life.Originally intended as a Steve Winwood solo album Capaldi and Wood offered their services during the recording of the album. The songs and playing meshed so well that Winwood, Capaldi and Wood decided to revive the Traffic name.The bonus tracks are a fine addition to this already great album. The sound quality is great. The booklet informative but doesn't suffer from overkill."
4,what were they thinking?,"This is a truly a masterpiece, and the re-mastered tracks sound great. But one star off for the bonus tracks, especially for the one stuck in the middle. I'm not a big fan of bonus tracks in general; they rarely add to the experience, but at least stick em at the end where they can be properly ignored. The liner notes for the re-issue give a clue to their cluelessness: ""Along with Fairport Conventions Liege and Leif, John Barleycorn Must Die stands as a pivotal statement in late 60's/early 70's British folk rock music"". Huh? Did the person who wrote that even listen to anything besides the title track???"
4,Great resource for the novice,"I purchased this book to expand my families appreciation for classical music. We are beginners, at best, and it's hard to know where to start to broaden your understanding. This book was VERY insightful. It is one thing to listen to the music and attempt to appreciate it, but to understand the perspective of the composer and the purpose of major pieces puts everything in a new light. I am really pleased with this purchase."
2,Spiritual?,"As one reads this book he must be alert to know the truth. Mr. Kavanaugh writes from a very broad and quasi-Christian viewpoint. His conclusion is that the majority, if not all the composers he writes about are Christian. He assumes all music written by these composers to be without flaw. As near as I can tell he believes that music is amoral. That is, he believes that music can not be right or wrong. This idea is at odds with the supposed Christianity of these composers. Oh, I'm sure many of them were believers. I can tell you though that not all are. And so you see my dilema. I love classical music and reading about the composers. However, I don't enjoy having to sift through a bunch of rubbish posing as spirituality."
4,A Good Example,"I read this book in one afternoon - I just could not stop reading. This book is about a teenage sweet girl that faces an unplanned pregnancy, and her plan to make the best of it.It is a very touching book that I strongly recommend to teenager girls, or any other woman who ever thought of abortion as an option."
5,Best of Steel,"I have read A LOT of Danielle Steel books, and this one is by far the best one. My mom won't read Steel, but I have tried and tried to convince her to read this one because it is different. It's sad and touching, it will make you cry. It is the best."
4,"Love drama, heart breaking and inspiring.","The novel had intrigued me, due to the realism of the main character and the surrounding enviornment. A young innocent teenage girl from a truly old fashion home is placed in a position of having to change all her dreams of a simple life with goals. Quickly and without any forethought she involves herself and the family in a act of shame . Because of the shame create by the main charactor , her parents sent her away, however she decides to takes up roots and she meets a friend. In her new location, she finds a family who has suffered a tragedy and after sharing time with this family shes determined to provide the family with the gift that would truly be considered special"
1,Grinnell IS in Iowa!,"This is the first Danielle Steel book I have read, and it will be the last. Aside from the sappy, predictable story and elementary use of the language, the book contains (for me, at least) an egregious editorial mistake - Tommy thinking about Maribeth, page 158 of the paperback: ""But there was something he didn't like to think about, her going back to Iowa and her parents."" This would be the same Maribeth who took a bus from Onawa, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska, then got off in Grinnell on the way to Chicago. The only Grinnell, with a college, on the way to Chicago from Omaha, happens to be the one in IOWA!!I suppose, to some people, this is a small point. However, in my opinion, if you're going to write fiction, make it up. Don't screw it up.And by the way, Grinnell is a very cool town."
3,Linnear and Doss,I'm a fan of the Ninja books so I might be a little biased but it seems to me that michael Doss is just a samurai version of Nick Linnear.
5,great book,This is a great introduction to one of the most outstanding photographers of all time. The author obviously understands Smith's genious!!
5,Great info!!!,"This book was written by the co-author on the joint custody bill in IL. There is a ton of great information and I highly recommend this to any father involved in an ugly litigious divorce. I wasn't seeing my daughter but after applying some tactics in here I have her every other weekend and monday and wednesday nights. Above all turn to God, he will help you more then anything. Best wishes."
5,More No.1 Detective Stories,"More stories of light mystery, wisdom, and the amazing land of Botswana. Could it really exist? I love these stories, and based on this second novel in the series, ordered the last two. You will want to read ""The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency"" first."
5,I love this series!,"Precious Ramotswe is quickly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters. For the uninitiated, Mma Ramotswe is the first female private detective in Botswana. But, to say she's only a private detective is like saying that Father Tim (from the At Home in Mitford series) is just a village preacher.I don't mind that most of the mysteries Mma Ramotswe solves are pretty transparent and not very dangerous. What I love about these stories is the way the author weaves a spell about simple people, living gracious lives, while being kind (for the most part) to one another.At the end of a Mma Ramotswe book, I'm left with a feeling of peace.This is sweet, gentle fiction...set in Africa, but it's universally appealing.I wonder who's going to star in the movie? Whoopi Goldberg comes to mind...or Alfrie Woodard....or Angela Bassett...strong, independent women all....like Precious Ramotswe herself.Enjoy!"
5,Amazing!,"Ahh, I found this band a while back through iTunes and its recommended bands, and that was where I heard their first single ""Sweet Talk."" It was catchy so I got the rest of the album, and it's seriously one of my most favorite CDs ever. All the songs are really melodic. My favorites are ""Paper Bag,"" ""Grace,"" ""Sweet Talk,"" and ""Midwestern Dirt."" One of the things that I really loved the most was the fact that the songs were so sing-able. Many of the choruses don't repeat themselves too, and I found myself constantly trying to sing them out with as much emotion as the lead singer does. One of the best bands ever! Can't wait 'till they finish the new CD! :D"
1,Cheap,"This costume is of very poor quality. It's so flimsy I don't think it would survive a wash. It's made in China and comes with several flammable warnings. I don't know about you, but the last think I want my kid in on Halloween is something flammable. The bunny feet didn't fit at all (too small) and the ears don't stand up straight. We took a few photos in in and threw it out. Not worth the money."
2,bearly acceptable,"Meant to be cute, and Black Bear cubs are certainly cute, this film is a reflection of the attitudes of tourists who visited Yellowstone in that 1950s era that had no real understanding of wildlife. Unfortunately the film did nothing to educate, even falsely protraying park rangers as accomplices. It mentions in passing that Park rules are that there is to be no feeding of bears, but then shows that everyone does it. It shows that getting attacked by a bear is just a matter of being knocked over. I shows that a problem bear is one who is fed, then wants more - from a human that was the problem. Good interpretive skills used inappropriately."
5,Excellent Phonics tool,This is an excellent phonics tool. My children are learning and they just think it is fun. Great for anyone trying to teach their children to put sounds together.
4,Talking Words Helps Them Read,Leap Frog - Talking Words FactoryThis is a great video. My son learned 3 letters words because of this video before he was 4 yrs old! It was a giant leap for him due to this video getting him past just letter sounds but understanding how together they form a word. There is a game also you can play with your remote that comes on the DVD. That helped him practice his skill without knowing he was learning!! He loved this video. For me it felt a tad chaotic and noisey but my son LOVED it so that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
4,great stuff,"other the annoying voices, i actually enjoy seeing my boys watching this video, it is a keeper!"
5,Great Learning Tool!!,"Daughter has learned a lot from this video. She is two and a half and knows her letters and the sounds they make; this video has helped teach her how to put letters together to make words. she can now read three letter words like fun, cat, hat..i would highly recommend this video to parents! It can be hard to keep your childs attention when teaching them something.. this video will keep them engaged and learning!!"
3,Educational and entertaining,My son is 22 months and loves this video. He asks for it all the time. He can recognize some of the words if I write on a magna doodle!!
3,The Letter Factory held my kids' attention better,"My kindergartener, who already knew how to put sounds together, enjoyed this movie; but my three year old, who doesn't know these concepts, wasn't really interested."
5,learning to read,My [...]son loves this DVD. He doesn't quite get the process of sounding words out yet but he loves to watch and sing along. I can just see the wheels turning.
5,Noonan Building & Wrecking,"I really enjoy this CD. If you are a person who enjoys female vocalists, this album is a must. I would recommend anyone who is a person who loves good blues with a bit of a folk twist to make this purchase. Because of limited availability, Amazon is the best place to buy.Thank youJosh Lawson"
4,neo-mysticism,"Finally, someone puts mysticism BACK into Christianity. This book is ideal for anyone truely seeking to develop spiritually."
2,?,"The story did not match the story in the movie. They said a devil worship cult, when it was not. It was about a scientist who could bring back the dead with a capsule put into their dead brain making them move and murder under his control. This movie is a scam, to make people look at it. Generally, it was a ok movie, but not the one it says it is. Null."
1,DON'T BUY,"Terrible print, awful transfer and the dubbing was (and always is) bad. I could not finish this film, because it was painful to watch for the prior reasons and it just wasn't all that good. Maybe with a decent print and sub-titles it would have been a different experience, but I can not recommend it. Positive reviews must have been written by Troma employees."
3,ok,I liked how the stages were very dark and alone but the acting and computer graphics were terrible.
4,"All the scenes, Please!",Release a special edition ALIEN 3 with the deleted scenes included. I bet it would be a lot less confusing! I also hope they release a special edition of ALIEN as well. That would make me very happy to see all the scenes originally in the film.
3,Should've been the end.,Many people don't like this film because of its change of pace from the harried second installment. This one really should've been the end of the series. I can't believe 20th Century Fox allowed this to keep going. Alien 4 was ridiculous and I can't believe they're contemplating a #5!
3,How did the egg get into the hypersleep chamber room?,"To the writers of this movie -- how did an egg get laid in the hypersleep chamber room? The queen alien in ""Aliens"" got into the cargo bay of the mothership by hanging onto the shuttle departing the planet. She was then promptly ejected into outer space after an intense battle with Ripley operating the robot (I don't remember exactly what the piece of equipment was called but it moves like a robot). The queen was NEVER in the hypersleep chamber room and I don't believe there was any other way the egg could have gotten in there. There were better ways to kill Ripley. Other than this terrible excuse for an AIDS metaphor it was a pretty good movie."
4,ALIEN 3 BEYOND THUNDERDOME! 3 1/2 STARS VERY GOOD ENTRY!,"They just couldn't let there be a somewhat happy ending to Aliens! The third installment in the Alien series isn't as bad as some have said. This film starts out where 'Aliens' left off. The ship and crew are discovered and of course there is an unwelcomed visitor on board! Going back to a similar style of the first film where the action is sparse, but tension is high. I don't like to give too much away in my reviews, but if you have the patience to watch this film through, it's worth your time.Everyone has their opinions of sequels and the series could have stopped with the first film. It's pretty good as third installments go and could have been a fitting end to the series, but it's hard to keep a good monster down! The premise is interesting and the FX are good, but it does take some time to get going!.....when it does it's very good and the film has a very memorable ending!"
4,Review the movie?,Alien 3 is the last movie to stay true to the original. The rest are a bit too cartoonish for my tastes.
1,Should have stopped with Aliens,"One of the worst ways to ruin a sequal, in my opinion, is to kill off the survivors of the previous in the very begging. (What's the point in having them survive, then?) Not only does it hurt the sequal, but deminishes the previous as well.Then there is the whoel problem of how the eggs got there in the first place.If you want a good sequal to ""Aliens"", find the Dark Horse comics versions. They are ""Aliens: Book 1"", ""Aliens: Book2"", and ""Aliens: Earthwar""."
1,Horrible! The Worst (-5 stars out of 10),"Not only the worst in the series, but has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It ruins it for wanting to see Ressurection. Now I've seen alot of bad movies, but this was horrible. I was expecting it to be good since Alien and Aliens were equally great, but I've never seen one like this. From the beginning, everything Ripley did in Aliens, saving Hicks and the girl was a waste. But it just gets worse. ***DO NOT LET KIDS VIEW THIS!*** It literally says the F word 40xs! It's in every single sentence.... Definatly rated R for a reason. Don't even waste $3 on it. Just skip this one."
2,Worst of the Four,"This movie has a lot of flaws in it, first of all killing off everyone that survived the previous movie shows a lack of imagination not to mention that it spoils the ending of ALIENS. I thought that the way the designed the alien itself was inventive, I like the way it took on the characteristics of the dog and how it could run on walls. The whole story about the bald-headed prisoners who were suposed to be some kind of munks was wierd and confusing. The movie drags until you get to the last half-hour and even then its mostly everyone just running around."
1,A very sad and shameful sequel,Don't even try to make sense of the story. This movie was rushed and it bombed!
4,Complete Collection,Pretty much what I expected. I just needed to get it to complete my collection. Thanks to Amozon for always doing a good job on getting the product to where it needs to go.
4,Little bit different then previous ones...,"I liked it.The atmosphere is a little bit different, more focus on people and their relations in face of the danger.Ripley is a more developed character than in the previous movies, and other characters besides her are more developed too.We also learn more about the alien species. Especially if you had already watched the whole seriesand you've came back to watch it again more carefully.First movie is the great classic, second... needed to be made, third trails after first one in my opinion."
3,A disapointing third film!!!!!!,"This film is getting a decent rating for three reasons:The christain prisoners,the CGI for the dog-alien(despite how stupid the idea was),and of course,Sigourney Weaver third outing as Ripley.Besides those things mentioned,there isn't alot to like in this film.The story is too dark and depressing,the prison planet was a dumb idea,and don't even get me started on the stupid dog alien.Overall,the worst film in the ENTIRE series,but it's got some good moments.If you like Alien and Aliens,you may like Alien3.(based on the theatrical version only)"
1,Issues playing....,"I bought a copy used and will not play, I have tried it on two players one a PS3 and another one regular Blu-ray player and it did not play at all. I know it is not an issue with the seller, I have nothing against them in fact the were great in handling the issue it is a problem with the mass produced copies in my opinion."
1,What for?,"Why was alien 3 made?Who had the guts to say to 20th century fox,Hey lets make alien 3?A movie by all means never ever should have been made?Who?Why?I mean alien 3 is long, boring, and without imagination. Really puts down Alien and Aliens,two movies I love.But when you stand it up to Alien resurection,it is good.Allthough alien 3 is 2 hours and 15 minutes of my life i will NEVER get back its worth a watch for fans of the alien movies."
2,You might as well watch Rollie Pollie Ollie!,"ALIEN 3 brings back Ellen Ripley (Weaver) who is stranded on a prison planet, with no weapons, and yet another alien.MY REVIEW:""Overall: Skip this movie and head straight for the original two! ALIEN 3 is the worst! Don't Bother!""- MJV & the Movies."
4,blower motor,"so far so good, part installed fairly easily, seems to be working okay, but won't know until I've used it more this winter.I hope that it lasts as long as the original OEM blower, but only time will tell."
5,WANT,Somebody please tell me where the hell I can find this album? It is the only Doom joint I don't have and I need it!
4,Hi I make a living off of selling cds!,Sorry but does anyone else think that this review forum designed for Amazon buyers and sellers might not be the best place to try and trade burns?!? There are places for this and anyone who doesn't realize that one way to find an album would be to get a download perhaps could figure that out on their own.Thanx
2,Alex Alex Alex,He lost me with this Alex Cross book. I'm really getting tired of Alex's guilt trip and him doing nothing to fix it. His family is in danger and he goes out to save the world. Someone should sit him down and tell him to prioritize. Didn't like this one.
3,Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf,"Well after reading the previous books in this series and really not liking Four Blind Mice, I have to said this book probably ranked just above that one. Even though the book was a quick read, I don't really understand what's going on. The book takes you from NY, to DC, to FL, to TX, to CO then back to DC. I felt that Alex would eventually connect with ""The Wolf"" only he never did. I didn't like how the book ended with Christine and Little Alex or with the Wolf. Other than the ending, I have to say the book was a quick read, I still love all the same characters. I hope that John Sampson joins the FBI with Alex, that would make for some interesting writing. All in all the book wasn't totally bad, but really not one of my favorites that in a year I'll remember reading."
3,"O.K, But Not Spectacular","Mr. Patterson's in a tough place. He's developed a pretty good lead character in Alex Cross and used him effectively in a number of books. Unfortunately, it seems like Mr. Patterson's bag of tricks to make Alex Cross interesting are getting thin. He may have joined the FBI, but the change of scenery doesn't change the dynamic very much.As a result, the main thing that differentiates one Patterson book from the next Patterson book is the quality of the villian that Alex Cross is determined to outwit. Some of the villians, like the couple in ""Jack and Jill"" are good. Others, like the vampire killers in ""Violets are Blue"" are just silly.In this case, I would give the ""Wolf"" a ""B."" Although the idea of a Russian mob mastermind is a new twist, Patterson has already used a kidnapping/murder theme before. This book is O.K., but doesn't add anything particularly new or memorable to Mr. Patterson's collection."
2,What a rambling mess.,"I think Patterson's point to this novel is that some stories don't have a resolution and you don't always win. Personally, I prefer the conflicts I read about to come to a conclusion. Any conclusion would be good."
3,"not the best one, but still a great read","this book was a fun read, but the ending did leave something to be desired."
2,book is 3/4 done,"James Patterson did not play fairly. This book is not even close to being complete.The story also has significant flaws. The Wolf demonstrates he has the ability to get to any perceived threat. However, he allows Alex Cross free reign.The story was also very choppy.Patterson continues to stick to the same boiler plate when writing these novels.Alex Cross neglects his family; someone in the FBI is a turncoat; his family is in mortal danger; higher authorities undermine Cross's attempt to resolve issues.With that being said, I now have to wait for the next installment of this novel. I would not read this book until the next one is completed. Waiting 6 months to 1 year for the remainder of the story is a real turn-off."
3,Back to the basics,"I believe this book to be Mr. Patterson's return. It's sad to say but many of us fans have been dissappointed in his recent books. But this book took me back to the first book I read of Patterson which was Kiss the Girls. There's an element in The Big Bad Wolf, sad but I can't name it. Maybe it's the atrocity of the 'bad guy'. Or maybe it's that 'human' quality that Alex Cross is given back by the writer. I believe it was taken from him in Four Blind Mice, a story which wasn't a story, but a paycheck. Of course, the Alex Cross series has been Patterson's finest. If he includes this same element, if he builds this nostalgic quality of HIS writing, then his other series (Women's murder club) and the other non-series stories he has in his future, will not dissappoint."
3,Confusing,"Ok, so was it just me or did the end leave you thinking, weird? There were too many false revelations- that will make sense if you read the book. I don't want to give anything away but it just got annoying by the end when the ""Wolf""'s identity didn't even make sense. Patterson, in the future, know when to stop!"
3,Patterson's basic problem,"Patterson's basic problem is when he cowrites a book. When he works alone,his story line is tight and effective.When he collaborates it seems to be loose and not as compelling.Joshua41"
3,Not as good as I remembered,Haven't read Patterson book for a long time(3 or 4 years ago). Was disappointed with lack of detail and anemic storyline. Glad this was a library book and not something I had bought.
4,Mammasbiggirl,"I had always enjoyed reading James Patterson novels, hearing someone else reading it to me was a special adventure."
2,The Big Bad Wolf,"Well this doesn't read like a James Patterson book, I wonder if he now has some one writing for him and putting the James Patterson name on it. If it's not some one else then James my boy better start taking some more time in the writing process. Don't waste your money on this book, sit back and wait on the next book by James Patterson and hope he takes some more time to develope the story line. Larry Hobson- Author ""The Day Of The Rose"""
2,Half a book,Very disappointing compared to Patterson's earlier efforts. One fourth of the book is rehash of earlier stories. Another one fourth is an enjoyable mystery. The remaining one half is missing - still unwritten. Thank goodness I got this one from the public library and didn't purchase. Otherwise I would have felt cheated.
3,a good read,"Another Patterson, Alex Cross book and this was a good read. Enjoyed the characters as always and the fast paced writing.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,The Big Bad Wolf,"I am almost finished with BBW and have been complaining throughout about the lameness of this book. I have had people tell me for years to read James Patterson, they LOVE James Patterson. Picked this one up in a garage sale for about 50cents. (Glad I didn't spend any more on it.)I'm thinking I could write at least as well as this. After reading some of the other reviews, I'm glad it's not just me. The reviewers are saying what I'm thinking but am unable to put into words. I will continue since I at least have to find out how it ends."
2,"Patterson ""mailed it in.""",I was very disappointed with this Alex Cross Novel. It reads like Patterson quit on the last half of the book. The action just doesn't match up with the plot. Everything happens too fast and too easy. It is as if he is rushing to get through.I suspect this happens when a famous Author gets enough clout that his Editor cannot get him to do the needed rewriting. Too bad.
1,Cheap bad book,"Cheap novel. All happening, especially Wolf, looks unbeliavable. I know russian and was very surprised about what ""samochit"" means - I am sure this is author fantasy.Personal problems of Alex Cross like problems with custody of his son were completely out of story and I doubt anybody could be interested in them.I read several books recently - this is definitely the worst."
2,Way too shallow!,"After the total fiasco of The Lake House, I was looking forward to getting back to Alex Cross. However, this book was a disappointment. I read it in about 3 hours, and I'll never again buy one of Patterson's hardbacks. I'll wait for the paperback (second-hand at that) and save my money!This book was not as bad as The Lake House, but it wasn't all that good. Short, choppy sentences; lots of italics; no depth to the characters. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs; you can just read the first and last sentence in a chapter and pretty much know what's going on.I like books that ""take me away"" -- this book was one that I just wanted to get away from!"
2,Nothing original.,"This is a pretty good book - conceptually -, but it sure reminds me of 'War On Wall Street' by Peter Senese."
2,Such a disappointment,"I am a big fan of Jame Patterson's Alex Cross series and was hooked from reading ""Kiss the Girls"". However I am getting tired of them ... almost as tired as his plotlines. This novel had no real ending (I am presuming that this is to encourage us the read the next novel) and I certainly did not get as involved with this story as with previous ones.Alex Cross' situation has developed slightly, what with his relationships and joining the FBI and that was welcome, but I miss the strong bond with Sampson which seems to have gone in this novel. It simply feels empty and like Patterson has lost his bite. I will definitely think twice before buying the next one."
1,Way Below Norm,"This book reads like Patterson gave little effort to write a novel at the same level of most of his others. If it is possible to ""phone in"" a writing, he did it. If is as if he faced a deadline for fulfilling a book committment and just slapped this together. Vert disappointing."
5,Very Pleased,"Product in condition as stated, great shipping times, secure packaging. Would purchase from seller again."
2,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoy the Alex Cross books as a rule. This is the second time that Patterson has elected to stretch a story into 2 books. It is very disappointing to have a book be so intense and just come to a dead halt at the end. I think that it would be good customer relations if he would at least identify that his book is the first of two. Overall, Patterson has been one of my favorite writers, but with books like this I am starting to think otherwise."
1,Did not like,"Many games in this book were commonly known games like Marco Polo. Most were for teams, not many for two players. Also, after about #70, it begins listing games for outside the pool."
3,Great Chapters - Book So-So,"Let me start by saying that, for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The individual chapters were entertaining, educational, and in general very well written. Where my problem with the book lies is in how they tried to string it together as a book. There is a running plot line that involves the main character and the law that basically just falls apart two thirds of the way through the book. Furthermore, how everything was tied up (or, rather, wasn't) in the end was very poorly done IMO. This is really the main reason I subtracted two stars. It's impossible to discuss particulars w/o including spoilers, so I won't, but I honestly felt ripped off after turning the last page. Suffice it to say that the book would have been much better if it had ended 10 pages earlier.That aside, this book is easily as good as ""Box"" and is a very worthwhile read -- just don't get involved in the story line, and don't expect any sort of payoff at the end."
2,Not as expected,The product didn't work as expected. Didn't stick to the material on the couch and chairs. Very difficult to work with.
1,sticky paws,these are 9 x 12 inches-not feet like it says. they are so sticky that I couldn't get them out of the package and placed without getting them stuck to themselves and wrinkled and a mess of a sticky wadded ball. a waste of money.
1,Ok,"This movie is a bit boring, typical late teen movie, no money have to save the building before the bank claims it back. The brunette is the only girl worth watching.Not recommened."
4,As good as the first,"If you liked the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency you will enjoy the Kalahari Typing School for Men. Smith maintains his characters, and yet especially in this one expands on the character development of the assistant detective, Mma Makutsi. As in all books in this series, I feel like I am in Botswana when I read these books."
4,"A delightful, gentle book.","This is a book I did not want to see end, and certainly look forward to the next in the series. Smith develops the characters in this series so the reader feels a personal relationship with them. The stories are delightful, and the descriptions of life in this part of the world is wonderful. A great book, hard to put down!"
2,Kalahari Typing School for Men,"I read this for a book club selection. Unfortunately probably the best I could say is that it is generally a feel good book, and since we had traveled there, it was remotely interesting because of its placement in Botswana. It is a quick read, but I would not recommend it to most people."
1,Substance?,"I have to admit that I read only up through page 83, which is a little less than half way. Then, I just could not pick it up again. There is no intrigue, morality, imagery and hardly a plot. Someone, let me know if there is any substance in the second half. Please."
5,The Kalanari Typing School for Men: No.1 Ladies Detective Agency,"As with all the books in this series, I have fallen in love with the main characters, even the prickly Grace Makutsi. I rooted for her to succeed as the founder of the typing school. I have listened to this book at least twice, find it just as amusing and enjoy the whole story over and over again. Alexander McCall Smith has such a wonderful sense of humor that he imparts to his stories. I consider them priceless."
4,Thesis of Aikido and Ki,"Written in 1966, this is Tohei Sensei's third book after ""Aikido: The Arts of Self Defense"" (1960) and ""What is Aikido?"" (1962). At that time, Koichi Tohei was the Chief Instructor of the Aikikai. Later on because of politics or personal growth, depending on the source, Tohei formed his own organization, and for a while stopped using the term Aikido in favor of the term ""Ki"" (same as Chinese ""Chi"").Although there are some exercises described, this is more of a philosophical book which delves deeply into the spirit and theory behind the art and practice of Aikido. This is the first developed thesis on Tohei's Ki concepts, which are generally free from the superstitions and magical thinking that permeates some other schools of thought. ""KI"" according to Tohei has more to to with the unity of the mind with the body.Later revised editions of this volume were published as ""Ki in Daily Life"". I like the harmony of a unified Aikido presented in this earlier version."
3,It reads more like a physics thesis than a golf book.,"Only get this book if you love physics and want to analyze in detail mathematical models of golf swings and ball flight. This book is written by a physicist, and it shows. The author does an admirable job of analyzing the golf swing, but spends so much time describing how he built his models that the ""so what"" gets lost in the details. If you're looking to improve your golf game, other books will get you there with much less pain. For example Dave Pelz is also a physicist, and his book, ""Putt Like the Pros"" has very readable analyses and offers valuable and practical advice."
3,Doesn't Answer The Big Question,"As a golf instructor with an educational background in Physics, I enjoyed going through the technical aspects of this book. I enjoyed Dr. Jorgenson's take on the game of golf and some of his personal experiences. He has analysed the various levers and moves and reduced everything to mathematical formulas so that presumably quantities could be inserted in the equations to see what effect differences for weight, speed, force, etc. would have on the outcome. As for the outcome everyone is looking for, he never answers the question that I'm sure everybody has, namely, ""what do I need to change to get more distance""."
4,Morality for Beautiful Girls,The service was prompt and efficient. The seller aided me when I had a question. I am very likely to purchase again with this seller.
3,"The first two in the series were better, but...","this one was OK (but at times a little tedious), and perhaps even deserves 3 and-a-half stars.I don't think I will continue on with this series. ""Morality"" took me a long time to finish, even though it's an easy read, because of that tedium I alluded to earlier. But never say never. Who knows, maybe in a few months I will find myself missing those fictional residents of Botswana, and return to the series to read the fourth installment, which I believe is called ""The Kalahari Typing School for Men.""These are books written in a gentle tone, and in these very trying times that is most welcome."
4,Fun read,"I enjoy this series of books - the writing is picturesque. I find myself comfortably transported into a world that I know nothing about. No serious issues in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series - just fun, light reading."
2,Disappointing,The first two books in the series were very enjoyable however this book is difficult to get through. The book does not flow like the others. The story of the orphan girl's life is told differently in two of the books. The characters have become dry and the book is a chore to read. I will try the next in the series hoping this was just a one off thing.
2,Too forced,"There is too much of this book which reads like a junior-high essay which had to be 500 words or more. Too many references to the ""Little white van"" and ""Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni"" which only add text, not meaning. (I'm sure that this gets written with ""JLB"" and then a search and replace with ""Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni, etc) The story is formulaic, and the characters are not developed in any way.If you liked the previous books, you'll like this one. If you were hoping it got better, it didn't."
3,Not nearly as good as Entering Marion,"This album is even more hit-and-miss than Entering Marion. Only a few songs (most notably ""The Juice a la Seuss"") really hit the funny bone; the rest seem overlabored (""Type A"", Spores) or just too long for the slight subject matter (Figaro Todd, Helium).And for some reason, the lyrics to ""Robert Moses"" don't stick in my head at all. I had to listen to the song 5 times just to figure out what he was trying to poke fun of...At any rate, it's very literally a ""sophomore"" album-- hopefully the next few albums will graduate John Forster into the realm of the great comedy songwriters. For now, this is mediocre, with a few highlights."
5,Great item,"This bag fits perfectly to the MKII shortboard, the FBV shortboard for the older spider series fits a little snug. The inside padding is amazing; you're board is safe and sound with pockets for everything you need to accompany the bag."
1,Don't buy it!...It is NOT what is pictured!,"This is the SECOND one of these I have had to return. The first one was purchased THROUGH Amazon from zZounds. When it came it was a bag for a SHORTBOARD only. I returned it for refund only ( the only option with zZounds-NO EXCHANGES for product purchased from them through Amazon.) I just received the SECOND bag today, ordered DIRECTLY through Amazon and I got the same WRONG ITEM!!!! The Item listing on Amazon clearly shows a bag with a large half moon shaped pocket that will fit a Pod bean. The reviewers above also crow about EXTRA pockets for power supply and cables. This bag came with ONE side pocket barely large enough for a couple of guitar cables (and certainly NOT large enough to carry a Pod OR power supply). If you want a bag that will carry your FBV board, Pod, and power supply together, this item is NOT recommended...no matter what the reviews OR the (misrepresented) picture show!"
4,Beautiful Work,I have a different use for this book than perhaps the typical buyer. I bought it because I love adapting these iron designs into borders or patterns for my pen and ink drawings and paintings. Each page was such a delight when I discovered this book I bought it immediately. You need not use it as a home furnishings book. It works just as well as an inspiring art book.
4,Very interesting reference,"I enjoyed this very much. I wish there could have been more photographs, but that would have been a different book. This is almost exclusively line drawings.Very helpful and informative. Warning: trying to duplicate these in decorative metal today is *expensive*. Architectural salvage might be more affordable than starting from scratch."
5,Rich C,"My local front end shop had told me i needed adjustable upper ball joints to correct my tire wear problem, After pricing these with four differnt auto parts stores, I found them to be the least expensive through Amazon, So i purchased them and saved about $ 40.00 dollars total.Not a bad savings for a little price shopping !!!"
5,"""Happy New Year""","When I went for my morning walk on this the first day of 2004, I randomly picked this CD to keep me company. I had not listened to it in quite some time and so, in some ways, I was hearing it for the first time. I have no idea why I had let it sit so long without going back to it. But I did return and I feel much the better for it. The title song, ""Further and Further Away,"" and ""Time Taketh Away"" were so appropriate for the day. I have just ordered two newer releases of hers today and I look forward to a continued reacquaintance with her music during 2004. Great beginning to the year!!!"
5,More great tunes from Cheryl,"As always, Cheryl Wheeler, delivers a variety of songs which will make you laugh and cry. She is a very gifted songwriter and singer. These tunes will stick in your head for days."
5,Pro Asp.net 2.0 Website Programming,This book has provided me with endless useful tips on how to write and organize professional Asp.net 2.0 code in Visual Basic 2005. Lots of little nuggets not found in other asp.net 2.0 books. To me this has been indispensable. FYI This won't be the only book you need if you are new to asp.net but it makes an excellent addition and will fill a gap in your libarary if you already have a beginner or intermediate book on the subject. Most Professional and specialized books on asp.net 2.0 are written in C# that's great if your are a C# or Java developer but for professionals like me who write VB.Net don't have time to learn or reinterpret another language before project deadlines. Not all professional applications are written in C# you know! Kudas on a job well done
2,Good sound but poor construction!,"I was pleased with the sound quality and FM reception of my iPal, but the antenna broke off the first week I had it and now, 2 months later, it has begun shutting itself off (losing power) a few minutes after being turned on. As well designed as it might be, it's still made in China!"
5,Tivoli ipal,This is a great am/fm ipod player. The sound is great for something that is not stereo. I would highly recommand this to anyone that wants portable music
2,Horrible Battery Life,"I have now had two of these in three years. After a year or so, you ahve to replace the expensive battery pack. I am very disappointed."
4,love the sound and look,"It gives great sound and good reception. I wish it came with an iPod dock though. Glas they didn't put on the runbber coating of the past, because that wore off."
2,A better version of this title is available,"This is a copy of the 1950 out-of-print translation of a book now available in a new, complete and more accurate, authorized version, from Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, also listed at Amazon.com. Visit Otto Rank website for an excerpt from the preface."
3,Some Disadvantages of the Apple ipod...,"I will make this short..yes, it is user friendly and simplified compared to other mp3 players. BUT it is almost TOO simplified. here are some of the things it lacks.- No Line In jack for recording- No USB capability (except for the new version, but that requires you to buy and adaptor- Cannot drag and drop files like you can on the Archos Jukebox 20Gb (requires Matchbox to modify files on player)- a bit pricey compared to other mp3 players- It's Apple, enough said..- only can create playlists through Matchbox- since it is firewire and most people dont have firewire cards you much purchase one, but not only that if you ever want to use it as a portable swap drive to share files, the other computer would need the card too."
1,roll the dice,"This is probably a great product if it happens to work with your system. Do not buy this product if you have the following setup: Windows 2000 and Maxtor firewire card. If you have some other setup then I can't guarantee it won't work for you. Customer support consists solely of a discussion forum where ""users"" can write *to each other*! I highly recommend you visit this page of frustration on the apple website before buying this product."
3,Can't queue music with iPod,"I bought an iPod yesterday and will be returning it today. I could have lived with all of user interface problems with Music Match jukebox but one thing was a showstopper for me. You can't queue up music in the iPod itself. It expects you to make playlists using the MMJB software and then transfer them to the unit. I don't know about all the other iPod users, but I prefer to look at what music I have on my MP3 player, and then queue it up whatever way I want for what I feel like listening to at the moment. My old and clunky Nomad Jukebox (first version) lets me do this and I couldn't imagine having a MP3 player without it.Apple keeps releasing software updates with video games, contact databases, and calendars rather than working on improving the MP3 player capabilities. I think this is something to think about since this unit is a MP3 player and not a Palm Pilot."
5,Insomnia Cure +,"We've had our iPod for a number of months now, and it is hands down the handiest musical device we own. You can connect it to your amplifier, plug it into your car's tape player, or if you only have a radio tuner, you can even pick up an add-on FM transmitter. Plus, its great for blocking out the snores of others while on business trips.Music playback is superb. 20 minutes of cached music (anti-skip) makes the battery life phenominal. Hard drive reads are quick. 10+ hours on a charge means it'll last all night. Firewire connectivity gives fast music download. I loaded 10 gig of data in about 20 minutes (Mac Version)."
5,Best MP3 Player Available,"I own the Mac version, so my rating is based on that experience. But I found one of the PC reviews interesting. It said:>Downloading songs can be lengthy and battery intensive so the battery may only last for an hour or two while downloading via a non-powered FireWire card and so you will have to recharge before downloading to the iPod again.<You can download 4000 songs in about 20 minutes or so. What is this ""hours"" problem? Sounds like a really bad firewire card problem."
3,Good spares for the price.,"Probably won't last a long time but they are good as spares to have around. Not the best optically but again, for the price...."
2,Not all it was cracked up to be,"These LOOK great on my husband, BUT they are made from cheap plastic. Really, they feel like children's cheapo sunglasses. The hinges don't open all the way, and in one month, the coating was flaking off. I went for it, reading the previous raving reviews. I really wanted them to work, because from a distance they look great. BUT, they are cheapo and my husband says they are like looking through a fishbowl. ""Lenses"" are cloudy and plastic. One star for quality. 4 stars for style. 2 stars total."
4,As advertised,These glasses are fine for the price. Very inexpensive but they do the job. Good service and fast shipping.
4,Great device but software should be improved,"If you are a former Mac user, like me, and like Apple products because of their design and ease of use, you will love the Ipod for PC's. With no moving parts and loads of space, you will find it easy to fill this puppy up with all your favorite tunes. Musicmatch is acceptable with occasional issues. My biggest complaint is not having full time access to time and date on the screen. This would be simple enough to accomplish since a lot of users would benefit from a quick glance at a clock to see the time. Instead, you have to scrool through a few layers to see the time and date. I wouldn't consider this a huge issue but I expect more from the designers at Apple. Overall, I would say that if you want one, buy it!"
3,IPOD - HOPEFULLY NEW IPOD WILL BE MORE RELIABLE,HAD IPOD FOR 10 DAYS-JUST RETURNED-WILL WAIT FOR FRIDAY'S RELEASE OF NEW IPOD. IPOD WAS UNRELIABLE- FROZE BOTH TIMES I USED IT DURING MY RUNS AFTER 20 MIN. BATTERY NEEDED RECHARGE AFTER 1 HOUR. WAS TOLD THIS WAS NOT THE NORM. WILL GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY WITH APPLE'S NEW IPOD VERSION. IT WAS REALLY SUPER FOR THE 40 MIN OR SO I USED IT.
1,What a nightmare ! Don't do it !,"After much research - I took the plunge - and plucked down [money] for this thing. What a mistake ! Musicmatch software syncing to IPOD was awful - with dropouts - and transfers in which you had no idea whether the songs were transferring or not. There is no visble indicator of song transfer ! Then I tried Ephpod after reading some reviews - it just caused XP to freeze. Believe me, I put computers together as a hobby - and this thing was a big mistake. Don't spend your money ! Poor software & too expensive - even with the 10GB ! I'm returning mine - last Apple I ever own !"
4,space,"while there are millions of ambient artists out there, they dont have the sound that set fire to flames have. to go along with the other reviewer, there is an influence of the godspeed members but it is not at all like the albums made on constellation records. there is much more space, and mood set by eery strings and noise. it is kind of like infinity symbol of godspeeds, the more desolate, expansive sound and less grand compositions. its deff. something to check out if your into that kind of music but do not go in expecting another 'post rock' or whatever you want to call that genre. its in a field of its own pulling strings with noise artists with sampling and tape minipulation. enjoy."
2,Who is this book for?,"Good for someone with a LOT of Game Programming EXPERIENCE ( Not me ). Most of the chapters in this book are articles (good articles ) taken from magazines. I just find it funny that so many reviews of this book are so good. I think the author had too many journal articles floating around his desk, so he stapled them together (at random) and made this book."
2,A good start that was published too early.,"I love Arthur C. Clarke's books. Always have. But. A big but... 3001 starts out fantastic and I blazed through the first couple of chapters letting Mr. Clarke tell me, what appeared to be, another good story. But it would appear that Mr. Clarke didn't want to tell a story. That he only told this story because he was asked to continue his most famous story line. The worst part is that he felt that he needed to flash back to remind the reader of what happened to Mr. Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I ever feel that I need reminding of that great tome, I will dust off its well worn cover and retrace those steps. 3001 just seems unfinished. A true Clarke fan may find it interesting, but few will find it the type of book that one can return to like our other old friends on our bookshelves."
3,A big disappointment,"The book was interesting as it started out then started to drag. When Frank Poole was going to meet up with Dave Bowman, I thought that this would be the highlight of the book. Instead Mr. Clarke only summarized what happened between the two characters. I also thought the disapperence of the monolith was confusing. I'm not sure what really happened. I also thought that disabling the monolith with an old computer virus was really streaching it. Also I thought HAL was destroyed in 2010. Mr. Clarke didn't explain how he was resurected and merged with Dave to become Halman.A very disappointing book."
5,The Best Book I've read Since the Count Of Monte Cristo,"This story is one of the finest I read, I finsihed it the day I took it from the Library. I hope to read the other books soon, I found it Highly entertaining, although I don't know how it compares to the other books... YET."
1,What a waste of time!,I keep hoping that this book would go somewhere or at leaste give you something to think about. A best a poorly written unimaginative and already done many times story.
2,Click BACK and do not return here...,"I gave 5 stars for 2001, 4 stars for 2010, 3 for 2061, and... I was tempted to give 1 star or none at all, but I felt sorry for Arthur C. Clarke, because he is my favorite writer... So what is this book? Half lecture, half pulp science fiction... Surely, he could have done much better than this!!! SHAME... TT"
2,Not worth the wait...,"I grew up on Clarke. His novels and short stories fuelled my avid interest in science, evolution, and academic pursuits. It used to be that I could not wait to read the latest Clarke edition. But the last good books Mr. Clarke has written were 2010 and Fountains of Paradise.All subsequent books by Mr. Clarke, including 3001 have lacked the ingenuity and sense of wonder present in his earlier work (i.e. Childhoods End, Rendezvous with Rama, Expedition to Earth).I thought that 2061: Odyssey Three was low point of Clarke's writing, but 3001 is nothing more than a ""cut and paste"" job from all the intruiging ideas explored by Mr. Clarke in previous books. The notes at the end of 3001 are more interesting that the actual story, and most of those notes appeared in the much earlier (and brilliant) Fountains of Paradise.My advice to those that loved 2001 and haited 2061, give this book a miss"
3,Nice Nostalgic Fluff,"The book isn't deep, hard to read, of straining. It's justyour average piece of science fiction fluff with the added benefit ofrecalling the seductive nostalgia of 2001, 2010, and 2061. Wait for the paperback then find a cosy spot to let yourself relax while reading a little mind-candy."
3,"Answers all the past mystries, but with an ID4 ending?","A great surprise in the resurrection of Frank Poole. A great deal of answers to many of the puzzles in the past three books. Arthur C. Clarke is a genius in writing future sci-fi books, but I was very disappointed in the final solution the human race had for dealing with the monolith. Without giving it away, let's just say that Clarke did a little Independence Day copying. If the monolith can do all that it can do, it shouldn't have been this easy for the human race! Still a good story and well read by John Glover!"
4,"Okay, I guess...","Even though I'd seen the reviews here, I decided to buy the paperback edition from an airport and I read a large part of the book on a long transatlantic flight. I didn't really expect much, so I wasn't as dissapointed by the book as I *might* otherwise be. I like ACCs speculations and descriptions of the future and that was enough (BTW, I can't sleep in airoplanes, so I had to do something...). So, in this context, it was good. Furthermore, I don't see much difference between 3001 and 2010 and 2061 (apart from the fact that ACC is maybe running out of really original things) and I gave those two a relatively high rating (ok, maybe too much), so... After all, ACCs original ideas to stories/books written is not that high. He tends to have some ideas that he ""recycles"" from time to time, but that's OK by me (as far as I don't read his books too close together :)... To sum up, a relatively pleasant and easy to read book."
1,"A grave, and unecessary finale.","I read the entire 2001 trilogy, and liked 2010 the most. 2061 lost me a little, but it was still marvellous. (They should do a movie of this one.) But 3001 was a totally unnecessary ending. Much of it is implausible, even for the next, next millennium. The resolution for the Monolith plot thread seems far too convenient, and the black enigmas were best left a mystery. The future of mankind was good enough in 2001-2061, but it is depressing here. And a ring around the planet? Even for 3001, this is a bit too much. I still respect Clarke though, but he failed to finish the story in a good way. The ending, to me, is best left to 2061."
3,What Frank Poole did upon his Summer thaw,"Clarke's prose moves with calculated efficiency, in strikingresemblance to the monolith's makers. Unfortunately, we are given thetiniest taste of what the makers have in store for the Sol system, and the story abruptly ends.It is nice to see one view of how humankind goes about the 'mundane' business of tugging comets about, in a dance of celestial showing-off, but not enough detail was given to the answers to the questions as advertised on the back cover.As a staunch supporter of Clarke, as any user of technology should be, I found no qualms with a ""Godless"" universe. But in the same way Stanley Kubrick forces our eyes to be distant, I found the characters of 3001 to be adrift in a cold, calculating universe. . . with HALman as the new God.Still, a must-read for Clarke fans worldwide"
2,Ok it wasn't the Greatest,this book was what i call junk i can't belive he wrote a book on this some part were ok but what the heck were you thinking.you ruined your self on the third so never make another and people don't read this if you don't like stuff that is so mixed up you can hardly read it but hey in the end it was preaty good.
1,3001 : The Final Odyssey,"This book was very disappointing given Clarke's other works. There was little explanation as for how Poole survived, and the book spent most of the time catching him up on the last 1000 years. I was expecting a big finale, and what I got was a few pages involving using a computer virus to trick the monolith system into giving humanity another 1000 years. When I got to the last page I thought, ""that's it?"""
2,Weak,"A weak ending to a great series. The sense of wonder was gone. Very little suspense and story. This is more Clarke's view of the future than it is a story about the future. Potentially interesting as an examination of Clarke's views on politics, but that's about it."
2,Unworthy of the first three Odyssey books.,"Clarke should have left well enough alone. 2001, 2010, and 2061 were all fascinating stories. 3001 appears to be little more than a Clarke manifesto, full of his not-too-subtle preaching on various subjects (it's one thing for him to be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever he is; quite another to go on and on about ""corpse food""). If you've completed the trilogy, leave it at that and pass this one up."
2,"Competent, but for Clarke less than expected.","Much of Clarke's work has made that indefinable leap into spellbinding mystical flight woven with the science of the world.This book is well crafted, but lacks mystery and never took flight from that spark of genius in the depths which Clarke has displayed in other books. Good as sci-fi goes, but way below the original 2001, ""Childhood's End"" or ""The Deep Range"", or ""The City and the Stars"".Some interesting ideas there. ZPF physics (which predicate the possibility of faster than light travel BTW), but the book felt kind of flat to me. It seems that Clarke's ideas have been shaped by his experience with the somewhat religiously based civil war there where he has lived."
2,3 stars for science fiction; only 1 for a logical plot.,"It is a millenium after the original 2001 saga that featured poorly communicative monolithic slabs of extraterrestrial technology causing havoc to an ill-fated spaceship on a voyage to Jupiter. Well, those monoliths are making trouble again. This time they are out to destroy the solar system, or at least the humans who inhabit it. But the technologically inferior humans try to outsmart their digital adversary with ancient computer viruses produced by terrorists with an adolescent mindset. Ignore the problem of operating system compatibility; the real leap of faith involves how the program is uploaded to the monoliths' server's cpu."
3,Quite a disappointing ending to a fantastic epic,"Although I was well aware that this book was the one to anwer all my questions, I was still disappointed to find that it did so easily. I'm afraid the adventure ended far too quickly for me - and I was especially saddened to discover that the Monoliths and their controllers had their weaknesses too. It was nice to think that us Earthlings will not always win in the end! All together I felt that Arthur C Clarke could have concluded this epic series in a far less hurried way."
5,Great conclusion...,"The book in general is terrific, because it's funny, original and very interesting. The autor show us a ""near"" future that will depend's on our capacity to manage the advance technology in convination with our inner values, like faith and love, in a new worlds with new paradigms. The final it's great too, with a profund message.This is a very final odyssey that you can't put it off."
4,Surprised to hear it was written,"Yeah, I knew there was a 2001, 2010, and the other one, but never knew there was the book 3001. I got it for my dad, I'll probably read it"
4,"Not on par with 2001, but then again, nothing is.","Don't go into this novel expecting another 2001, cause that's just about impossible. Instead, read this as an independant novel based on that universe, and you'll love it. Some of the outcomes contradict the teasers at the ends of the other odysseys, but so what? Just a side thought of my own, though: considering humanity as a whole has changed more in the last hundred years than we had in the previous two thousand years before that, I can tell you that in reality, by the real year 3001, I doubt humanity will be recognizable."
2,Terrible Toy!,My 4 year old daughter received this toy as a gift. This is one of the most poorly made toys I have ever seen. You can not move the stable without the entire thing falling apart and even if you try to play with it in one spot the sides fall off. The only decent part to the toy is the pony. I am close to throwing the entire stable in the trash! This toy is a total waste of money.
1,FALLING APART!!!,"This toys looks cute until you get it out of the box and try to put together. I paid $5.29 with free shipping - at least I got Honey Pie pony with it. This is the only item that is worth buying! The rest of the stable - cheaply made, thin plastic pieces that don't stay together. Please, read the comments - so many people can not be all wrong! Cheply made! Shame!"
2,Fun toy but not durable,"This toy was a great gift for my daughter on her 5th birthday. However, the stable was difficult to keep together and it kept falling apart when she tried to set it up and play with it. I think she likes the toy since it came with a pony, however, I would not recommend paying regular price for this item as it is not worth it."
2,Don't waste your money,The stable falls apart and pieces are tiny. Big waste of money - Very frustrating. I'm considering supergluing it together - this shouldn't have been a problem!
1,"Unoriginal, crappy, totally unfun.","The music in this game is totally unoriginal, obvious frat boy crap. We tried using this game to direct our power hour, but everyone just kept laughing at how lame the songs were. We ended up just passing around an ipod and having a much better time for it."
1,Worst Graphics Ever,It's YOU'RE drunk not YOUR. YOU'RE. Clearly this product was just a way to scam money out of people. If YOU can't take the time to grammar check before YOU release YOUR product than YOU do not care about the consumer's enjoyment. YOU'RE. YOU'RE. YOU'RE.
1,"AWFUL! DON""T BUY!!!!!!",Terrible graphics and audio. Don't waste a dime on this poorly produced drivel. If I could rate with no stars I would!!!
1,Just awful,I bought this because I thought it would be fun. How wrong I was this is the worst thing I have ever seen. Save your money and just go to the web to find a good power hour.
1,I'd rather rate this zero stars,"I've been doing ""power hours"" both audio and video since like 8 years ago when I started college. It's really fun and a great way to kickoff a night. Whoever made this has found a way to suck ALL THE FUN out of it. There's really no point since it's just like a ticking clock on the screen. If I wanted to watch a ticking clock for an hour I'd go to the dentist. I want my money back plus damages for the bad name this is giving power hours in general haha."
1,You Call this a Power Hour?,"Not to be rude, but this was really atrocious. It's basically a ticking clock. Just Google ""Power Hour"" and there are dozens of sites where you can get better PHs for free. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,It's Awesome!,This is such an incredible game. The power hour is totally packed with fun and amusing twists and turns. It gives you thrills and chills every moment and will just deliver the excitement you need. Highly recommended to anyone who has been doing this in real life
4,Great for the non-active listener,"I have owned an ipod since March of 2002. It is a great mp3 player, easy to use, sounds great, firewire interface, and made by Apple. Couldn't get any better, right? After running four marathons with the ipod I am finidng that is becoming confused with the amont of power it has left. Last week I only got about two hours of play before it quit. The ipod can also get confused about where it is on a particualr playlist, very aggravating. These problems only occur during the boucing and movement that comes from working out. It is a great mp3 player, but a little too sensitive for the active listener."
2,Out of date,"The guide has alot of info for players if they were stilling playing the beta for the game. Discipline runes, house prices, and abilities are just a few of the items that should have been updated before this book was printed. Class info is very helpful though and the world map and the monster guide helps as well. All in all this book really was worth it IMHO."
5,Write down your own MISERABLE and UPSETTING research!,"I found this book as the Log Book inside a Geocache this summer. I laughed and was immediately captivated as soon as I read the back cover:""Rather than reading such depressing stories, you may prefer this Blank Book, in which you can write down your own miserable and upsetting research.You may use this volume to record many dreadful things:- the names of suspicious teachers you have encountered- details of curious conversations you have overheard- dreadful information you have found in other booksThe Blank Book also offers the following helpful features:- grimly decorated pages- numerous unpleasant quotations from A Series of Unfortunate Events- sinister stickers to help mark your most strange and shocking entries""I knew I had to own a copy of this just for the humor factor! I show it to people and they give me a What The.....? Reaction!"
1,Do not buy this book.,"Do not buy this book unless you like wasting money, and if that's the case you should be sending your money to me.This is a worthless book. You get some cheap, small stickers and a blank journal. It's not worth[ ... ].If you really want a cool blank book go buy a notebook for [ ... ] and make your own. You can waste your money and your time--MULTITASK!"
1,Now you're the sucker,"The book contains a lot of filler dialog to stretch out the ""cons"" as much as possible. Six to eight pages for something that only needs a page of description. You are the sucker to pay $13 for what could have been about 15 pages of material."
4,THE Guide to the Adirondacks!,A well written and easy to follow guide to the best climbs in the ADK's. Don gives the important information while allowing the climber to experiance the adventure of Adirondack climbing.
4,God's gift,"Typical of Dee Henderson. Well written, enjoyable and easy to read. Held attention til finished. Highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Henderson's style of writting."
1,God's Gift,A very good book by Ms. Henderson. A very enjoyable read. Ms. Henderson continues to produce wonderful tales. She is a very good author. Enjoy
4,Haunting,"I finished this novella in one night, I was so taken by the imagery and the genuine tone of voice. As a high-schooler of the late seventies, this story rang resoundingly true to that time and place. ....A day after reading The Crowded Room, I'm still feeling haunted by those hallways. All these years later it was surprising to find that the fears and anxieties remain amazingly close to the surface.A riveting read and a travel back in time. Just be prepared for a painful ride."
3,SmokeAway Program Worked for me,"I ordered this product after many failed attempts to quit smoking. The motivational tape in this package is the best I've ever heard. I listened to it twice and used the supplements enclosed, and I have been a non-smoker for 7 weeks now. Unfortunately the CD was broken on the second side, but the speaker mentions you don't really need it, and I have to agree. Every thing I needed was on the first side. Otherwise, I would have returned it. If you are truly committed to quitting, I definitely recommend this product as it makes it much easier to do so. I still listen to the CD occasionally as a refresher, and I am quite comfortable without the cigarettes."
4,Awesome !!1,This is great !! I got this cuz all the other things I had tried failed me I still craved a cig. But since I started taking this not a single craving its great !!! I have been a smoker for 20 yrs now n I cant tell you how nice it is to move on with out having to worry when my next break is or can we stop the car so I can smoke !!! My CD came broke but I sent them an email n they shipped it out a few days later but really didnt need it I was already to quit just needed a little push !! I recommend this to anyone who wants to quit the natural way .....
2,Poor and underpar..,I allways hate doing this but I have to. I could only read this for an hour. The research and organization just stink.
5,Treasure!,"How many books do you buy and read and buy and read, just to find that one book which will make a profound change? Well this is that book, believe me. (Even if you are not that interested in Masonry, because this book is about much, much more than Masonry).So, why is it good?It is well written. It is easy to read. It is interesting. (So interesting, it reads like a novel). It is relevant. It is thought provoking. It will cause you to look at things differently. It will make you a better person. What more do you want in a book? My copy is doing the rounds. But as soon as I get it back, I am going to read it again. Again."
3,Only average or so,"Nothing unique in the way of information. Poorly edited. I hate reading a book with spelling and grammatical errors. Cheap paper. A bit pricey for what it was, IMHO."
5,An Instant Classic,"Both explosive and brooding at the same time, this is hands down the most important U.S. punk album of the new millenium.The band has garnered high praise from all corners of the punk scene for their driving punk songs tempered with irresistable melody and hooks. This is definitely not a pop album by any means but instead brings to mind the early 80's heyday of Southern California with hints of Pariah and other Posh Boy bands, maybe even a little M.I.A. for the melodic hooks. But at the same time it has a darker edge the brings to mind the Wipers and early TSOL.This is an album that everyone should have. An instant classic."
4,Continuous Improvement Principles,This is an easy read book with some excellent ideas. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to improve something. The ideas can be used also in service and general life -- although primarily aimed at manufacturing.
2,Eh?...Whaddya say Gran'ma?,"I love this movie so this is a rating of the product--not the movie. I am hearing impaired and only buy movies with captions or subtitles. The product description made no mention either way but I thought I'd take a chance. I was sorely dissappointed. I don't know why 'Amazon On Demand' doesn't realize that many consumers who might enjoy these older classics may,--eh?...whaddya say Gramma?--be in need of visual assistance through captions or sustitles. I love this movie but gave the dvd away as a gift."
4,"Ambition, disaster, courage!!","This is a nicely written screenplay. My main complaint is Farrell's voice. But then, many probably like it. For me it makes the opera scenes quite forgettable. But the portrayal of a woman's ambition, success, maritial comflict, disaster, then a comeback make a good story. Another slight complaint. Parker overdid the lipsync. Extremely handsome is a decades pre Bond Roger Moore."
1,Rip Off,128 pages of blank lines !! Why don't they tell us up front that this is a NOTEBOOK? Thr usage of the word JOURNAL is not significant enough. I wish I had my $ 9.95 back.
4,Nice live release...,"Lester Bowie died not too long ago -- something to feel sad about. This CD is a fine live recording of the Brass Fantasy doing their playful, exuberant thing. The cover and title refer to the LA Riots, happening around the time of the recording, but the somber theme doesn't stop the band from doing what they do. Really, there's nothing EXCEPTIONAL about this CD, though. I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU remains their most fully realized and satisfying disc, and there's nothing really to recommend about this recording above all others, unless, like, someone is obsessed with the LA riots. Steve Turre fans note that he doesn't appear on this CD."
4,It certainly kept me wondering till the end...,"Will they, or won't they?I was pleasantly surprised that Herring managed to keep me going till the end after first contact had been managed and broken off. This one had an interesting--if not a little unsettling--psychological twist about it, and it's been a sweet, neat, and cute story to read.But, I guess I was hoping for a bit more...antagonism, perhaps? There were certain issues in the book that I find could have easily been extended into more serious problems (and provide a whole lot more fun), and yet Herring chose to gloss over them in pursuit of other seemingly menial issues. The characters were all right for a story as short as this one, but would have lacked in complexity had it been extended.Still...this book was meant to be a romantic interlude, and it is certainly that. I'd recommend it; just don't expect too much out of it..."
4,Un Clásico de la Psicología.,"Este Libro al principio un poco pesado y teórico, después demuestra el resultado de muchos estudios realizados en personas y niños, explica el por qué de algunos comportamientos. Una lectura que vale la pena leer con detenimiento y analizar. Lo tenía en físico, lo había leído hace mucho tiempo esta vez lo compre para tenerlo en electrónico y volverlo a leer ya que vale la pena."
4,For what its worth...a beautiful effort...,"The Cardigans have grown into a band un-recognizable from their first incarnation, and though I miss the the sugary goodness of their retro past, if they are going to put out music, it may as well be the stylings of ""Long gone..."". The stand-out tracks for me are ""Communication"", ""You're the storm"", ""For what its worth"", and the addictive ""Live and learn"". The poppy up-beat music of my favorite LIFE wouldnt fit anywhere on this album, the melancholy and sadness is just too lonely to have room for anything else...but the Cardigans are still a favorite of mine simply for the skillful music they put out, and this album is no exception."
1,"Just like with Gran Turismo, the Cardigans let me down again","I wanted to love this CD so bad ... but alas, I am not moved. Everything I love about the Cardigans sort of slipped away with Gran Turismo, and now the magic is truly gone. I even bought the ""A Camp"" CD and it kinda grew on me, but I'd rather have the money back from re-selling this CD than the music on it.The bouncy, happy-yet sometimes beautifully wistful music found on their first three CDs was like aural Prozac to me ... if I ever felt sad or depressed or whatever, Nina Persson and company could medicate me with a few good doses of joy. In addition, ""Other Side of the Moon"" is so awesome that no real Cardigans collection can be considered complete without it ... but that's where I drew the line. ""Gran Turismo"" was marginally terrible, and now this ""Long Gone"" nonsense.Sure the band has a right to change ... but I don't have to accept it and change with it. And what's with her black hair? She was so much cuter as a blonde."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was never a fan of The Cardigans until they got a bit noisier on Gran Turismo. I thought ""Lovefool"" obnoxious and considered The Cardigans too ""bubblegum"" for their own good (although, I've always had respect for the guitarist). On Long Gone Before Daylight, The Cardigans seem to be taking another direction entirely. Branching out into a mellower, more sophisticated (mature? palatable?) realm of the pop world, they've put together an album surprisingly consistent and pleasant. There is nothing groundbreaking or extremely original but instead it is a collection of solid songwriting and catchy hooks amounting to what I consider their best work. If The Cardigans continue their rapid growth, they could very well become a yard stick by which modern pop-rock bands are measured."
2,You can't repeat the past,"I was a huge fan of the first five albums of the Cardigans. A couple years after Gran Turismo came out, I gave up hope of another album ever coming out. So, I was delighted with news of Long Gone Before Daylight. Unfortunately, I just cannot connect to the new sound on this album. The vitality of the other albums is missing. The lyrics are great on these songs, but the music just cannot pull me in... My favorite song on the album is A Good Horse, though it breaks my heart that I can't say anything good about the other songs. Ah well. Such is Life."
4,Wonderful,"To begin with, I have Life, FBOTM, and Gran Turismo. I was listening to some of them recently, and I wondered why I hadn't heard anything new from them in a while. So, I looked on the web and, sure enough, there was this new album. I first went to a couple of stores to see if they had it in stock, but their import prices were a bit steep. Anyway, the album is great. It's a lot darker than any of the others, but that hasn't stopped Radiohead from selling any albums. It's worth buying if only to get Feathers and Down. Two songs, For What it's Worth and A Good Horse, are also exceptionally good. If you liked A Camp you will really get into this album. If your like me, Nina Persson's voice is probably what you want to hear, and that has never sounded better."
5,The Golden Age of Great Music,"Marilyn Manson, the king of controversey is back, and better than ever. At one time, this band that was once known as Marilyn Manson and The Spooky Kids couldn't come up with a decent song if their lives depended on it. Now, they have come up with a chart topping ablum. The music is catchy in a dark sort of way. This isn't a CD with a single and filler songs, every song is wonderful and unique. Manson fans new and old are sure to love this album."
4,"Good audio, poor visual","The newest chapter in Marilyn Manson's musical career is not a let down. The album impressed with several great songs and memoriable lyrics. This album will definately upset some delicate groups.However, Marilyn Manson's attempt at movie making was a real disapointment. Not only was the imagery reminescent of a teenagers over-funded attempt at making something disturbing, the soundtrack could put someone to sleep. The repeating sentences and droning of his voice over and over again forced me to start praying the movie would end.He's got a real talent for songmaking, but Marilyn Manson ought to leave the videocamera in the hands of professionals."
2,"Same deal, different time period.","This album isn't nearly...for a lack of a better way to put it, quality, as his other efforts. Every album usually had something that drew you in to engage your senses. Now hearing the whole album, I felt he took all the annoying cliches from his predecessors, tossed it into a bag, shook it, spilled it out, and called it the golden age of grotesque. Nobody cares about his senseless rambiling about the media anymore, i was let down when I heard the new single. A couple tracks had some interesting segments, but for every good chorus a song had there was a lacking verse, etc.....pretty boring stuff if you ask me. Overall it almost seems like Mansion didn't put his all into this and instead the cookie cutter album seemed like it was attempting to reach out to an audience that has moved on."
2,Dita von Teese has spoilt this Goth,"I don't believe this. First the new style, then firing Twiggy. This guy is never short of shocks. Any decent Manson fan knows that it was the girlish Twiggy who gave the band their more traditional punk rock sound. Now that he's gone, only John 5 and Ginger Fish provide memories of what was once the REAL golden age of Manson's grotesqueness. But looking at the positive side of the album, New S**t and Slutgarden are the only songs worth listening to more than once. And what the hell is the deal with Kaboom Kaboom???!!! I can't believe that this is what they're coming to now. He should just stick to playing with dildoes and raping sheep instead of screwing over best friends. To conclude, don't buy this album, just download New S**t and Slutgarden. You should own Mechanical Animals and Holywood if you like this kind of music. This is a sad era for Mansonites."
4,My impression,"Exploring different artistic influences, this album feels more playful and rythmic then the earlier ones. Although angry, criticizing opinions float underneath the surface. Manson is a free spirit. I recommend ""Para-noir"", that has to be the best love duet ever made!"
3,Stick to Music,"The ""short film"" that accompanies this DVD, Doppleherz, is a prime example of why he should stick to music and leave the filmmaking to filmmakers. Brian, you're no ROb Zombie.I'll ditto the reviews of the music, but the ""film"" is nothing more than a vast waste of time. The further it progresses the less I care about the ""poem"" he is chanting throughout."
4,Better,"This is actually the first Manson album I like completely. Sure, I like a few of the songs of MA but I like this one ALOT!"
2,Manson Tries Again,"Not since Anti-Christ Superstar has Marilyn Manson released a record with anything close to resembling merit. While Mechanical Animals had its positive moments, it marked the steady path of decline that Manson and his team of goons have careened down without looking back.Now in The Golden Age of the Grotesque Manson returns to bite us...with another pathetic and abortive stab at validity. It seems that the further this man goes to try and be off the mark, the more horrible his creative attempts become. One interesting and comical moment on the record is when Manson attempts to rap, obviously buying into the rap-rock bull that has pervaded decent music since the post-Korn revolution.My advice, pass this one by. Better luck next time Manson."
5,Most will dissagree..,"I have a feeling that most people will disagree with me, but i think this is his best album, i have listened to his others, but the reason i say this is because this has the most mosh-to fist pumping songs of all his albums. And personally im not all that big on his other stuff, this is the only album i listen to, and then a few hits here and there off the other albums (i.e. Holy Wood, The fight song,coma white etc. etc.) If your new to manson, and are into metal, or hardcore stuff, and need that heavy riff to be there, pick up this one, if your not new to manson, this album is good, but most manson fans would find other albums to be better (mechanical animals, antichrist superstar, so on so forth). But for the most part this is a solid album, but may sound familiar to other songs , and may not have the shock value other albums had. o and by the way, im not 13 i just didnt feel like making an account."
3,MANSON NEEDS JESUS,"haha, just kidding. Any way, this is a nice album, not excellent, not quite 4 star. However 3/5 says that this is about average, which is my honest opinion. Hope ya liked the joke!"
2,Where have I Heard this Before,"Now I've been listening to Marilyn Manson since i first heard the song 'Get YouR Gunn' wayyyyyyyy back in late '94, and I gotta tell ya...HIS SHTICK IS GETTING OLD FAST!!! I'm sure that if it wasn't for 'Mechanical Animals' that we would have all been sick of this by now. Their's alot to be said about trying out new things, and I know it didn't exactly far well overall, but as the old saying goes, 'if at first you don't succeed, try again.' Please Marilyn, try something different, for god's sake, even Metallica experiments."
3,"Move along, nothing to see here","What I find a real shame is that Manson won't evolve. He won't change. Manson's better efforts were based on melody. With the albums ACSS and MA, he was trying to impress and get an audience. It's that drive to do well that forced him and other band members to write such classics as Lunchbox, Antichrist Superstar (the song) Rock is Dead and The Dope Show. Now, he knows that people will hang on his every word, and he's lazy. By god, he's so lazy. This CD is the musical equivalent of beige. It's just... bleh. Nothing makes it stand out. Manson thinks he can be clever with 'high brow' concepts like art, but he's too damn arrogant to try anything resembling variety. He's supposed to be a mainstream 'artist', for crying out loud. And now, he has run out of things to sing about, run out of ways to impress, run out of bassists to alienate. Come back, Jeordie. We miss you."
5,give me a break!!!,"Now some dedicated MM fans say wow this is less metal & little goth this sucks!! its more rock & a new style now i don't have time to review every song but this is another masterpiece like every Manson album Mr. Warner A.K.A. marilyn manson thank you for making masterpiece after masterpiece."" I don't say to be like me, i say to be like you and to make a difference."" - Marilyn manson"
3,Golden Age left me shaking my head...,"i consider myself an MM fan... my favorite albums by them are MA and HW...the album isn't definately bad, but it is indeed dissapointing. the lyrics are fairly awful, alot of bad choruses, empty verses, and way too much of the rap-ish firing off of monotone words we saw in 'Mobscene'. alot of the music isn't melodic or interesting, a big loss compared to his other work.the album isn't all bad; most of the songs, in fact, have good aspects to them. but it just doesn't rank well with the rest of his catalog, or with what we know he was capable of.if you didn't like HW and were hoping for a good album here, go dust off HW and learn to appreciate it. if he'd chosen the right singles from it, and not made such terrible videos for them, it would have been a success and this album would be vastly different. but this is all just my worthless opinion."
1,"big prob, mob...","Save your money, or do yourself a favour... buy some good old Alice Cooper stuff instead of this... for diversity and CLASS, check ""Billion Dollar Babies""... or if you like it HEAVY go for ""Brutal Planet""."
5,"As below, so above and beyond.","Marilyn Manson, to some, is the very embodiment of Satan. With the echo of Anti-Christ Superstar, one could never expect such an uproar as with The Golden Age of Grotesque. This is one of the many sides of Marilyn Manson that should not be taken lightly. If you have any kind of respect for talent, art, and/or creativity, you should buy this album. You may be amazed."
3,A disappointment,"I have been a manson fan for years and this record is a major letdown. Unlike his other masterpieces, this seems to be nothing new and a major step back in his career. With the genius of Holy Wood after the mediocore Mechanical Animals I was hoping for more great things to come. For big manson fans only, for new ones I would recommend Antichrist Superstar to enter the journey into the sick, tormented mind that is Marilyn Manson."
1,ZZZZZZZZ.........save your money,"Worse than Holy Wood, this is the lamest Manson effort yet. The generic sound of each track with it's Verse-Chorus(bring in the distorted guitars and crash cymbal)-Verse formula is exceptionally annoying. And the lyrics are, for the most part rediculous. Most choruses seem forced: 'hold the 's' because I am an ain't' ??'we're five middle fingers on a ...hand' ??LameThe title track is fantastic and there are a couple of good songs but for the most part Marilyn Manson seems to need acceptance, singles, and a wardrobe more than he wants to explore being an musician and daring to do something a little musically different. Mind you, this is better than most [stuff] out there but I expected much more than juvenile Linkin-Park-esque jank..."
1,Horrible Stuff From Long-Time Manson Fan,"I can't even begin to say what a complete letdown this CD was for me. As a long-time Manson fan I really expected more, or at the very least to find ANYTHING that I like about this album. It's terrible and virtually all the songs sound the same...which in this case is not a good thing. I'm also convinced that Jeordie made a good move and got out while he could. What's up J5. Just a mess, and not listenable. Antichrist Superstar was brilliant. Mechanical animals was beautiful. Holywood was his darkest by far (my opinion) and argueably some of the bands best work. This, however, is [not good]. I haven't even looked at the DVD yet, and don't intend to. I wouldn't reccomend this album to anyone."
4,Book review,This is a good overview of financial and managerial accounting. It provides the necessary details to understand the accouting system and financial management practices.It could be improved by better defining T-accounts equal ledgers in most accounting practices.
3,"Decent, but not great","If you're in this for the storyline, don't buy this. Personally, I found it pretty awkward. Some parts of the plot are left undeveloped, making them unbelieveable. It also seemed a bit rushed at places. The only part of it that I liked was the ending. I didn't really like the art style either. The blurriness of it just didn't appeal to me. Overall, the manga left me feeling dissatisfied.I'd recommend you buy ""Only the Ring Finger Knows"" by Kannagi and Odagiri instead."
3,Decent,"This manga is neither here nor there. The plot is a bit of a yawn, but it isn't terrible, and the smex is decent. It's a bit better than mediocre. The artwork is alright, and I didn't dislike the title, but I do reccommend borrowing this title and sampling it before you buy."
5,fiesta peacock 16pc place setting,the fiesta dinnerware was everything I hoped for. It was shipped in a timely fashon and came undamaged.
4,Good book,There are so many things in this book it's great. He has so many good ideas and amazing recipes. I'm so happy I bought this book.
4,Read this to get a more balanced view of John Adams,"This book came out in 1930 but I found it interesting to read. David McCullough in his bio of John Adams is one has to admit pretty hagiographical, as is Page Smith. I agree with both of those biographers, but I found it of interest to read this book which is less admiring of John Adams, though it says a lot of good things about John Adams, and his descendants."
1,No more Wiggles for my kid,"I have made a conscious effort to wean my 2 year old daughter from the Wiggles. Sure, their music may be up-beat and catchy, but while their tunes do not grate on my nerves, the lack of diversity in this video (as well as the other one I purchased) does.There is not one child of color in the entire production -- everyone is lily-white. Just because they are Australian does not exonerate them from cultural sensitivity. If you want to stoll down memory lane to the Romper Room T.V. show of 1964where no little black, latino or Asian kids were allowed,the Wiggles are for you."
5,Strong songs that have aged well,"This video is pretty retro now, but still worth getting. It has many of the Wiggles' best-known songs and holds our 18-month-old's attention. I was tempted to deduct a star for the production values, but the kids won't notice those. I'm distracted by the lip-sync being off (the audio is around an 8th-note early compared to the video), the heavy reverb on the songs and even some of the spoken parts, and the basic wooden sets and clumsy dancing compared to their later shows, but the most important audience doesn't care."
2,the Wiggles-Wiggle Time,"I was disappointed with this tape because it did not contain the ""Do the Monkey"" song which is previewed in the beginning of Barney's ""The night before Christmas"". It does say that this song is on the video and when I purchased it, it was not and my kids were disappointed. Its an ok tape and my kids 2,4 and 10 think it is pretty good but I would purchase something else if I had to do it again. If you can get a ""free"" copy take it but I wouldnt spend the money on it."
5,love the wiggles,"In answer to the reviewer complaining about cultural diversity (Jeff looks Asian to me)...I have noticed that they have shown a down syndrome girl, a little girl obviously going through chemotherapy as well as featured songs from Japan, Ireland and Africa to name a few (Wiggly , wiggly world). I was surprised at the complaint because I was always impressed that they did make a strong effort at diversity. Thumbs up."
2,Definitely Not What We Expected!,"My wife and I bought the Barney Video that previewed this Wiggles tape. My 14 month old loved the monkey dance. We did also! We sang the song and danced with her. So we ordered this video. It's definitely not what we thought we were getting. The monkey dance was very cute with all of the kids dancing along with the Wiggles. That's probably what our 14 month old liked the best. But, the video doesn't have hardly any kids dancing and singing along. I'm sorry to say, but most of the skits are very corny, especially with four grown men trying to act very silly. The Wiggles need the cute little kids like they have in the Monkey Dance in every one of their songs. I will say the Wiggles sing well, but that is what they need to stick to and let the kids do the rest. Overall, it's not what we bargained for. As a result we're returning the video."
1,The Wiggles - Wiggle Time,"It's a hoax! Where is the ""Do the Monkey"" song I saw in the Barney video? I and my daughter were very disappointed! Gimm my money back!"
1,"Wiggles, - Wiggle Time","We received the video tape one week after I placed the order, and it's definitely not what we expected from Barney video preview. I have to say it's quite corny compared with the monkey dance which my family love very much."
5,they wiggle when its wiggle time!,"we bought the wiggle time video after seeing how they reacted to a short song video clip on disney playhouse out of curiousity. living with my 3 year old niece and 18 month old nephew has seen me trying a circus of tactics to keep them entertained and interested. i know..i know.. 4 grown men dancing and singing?! but the thing is, they get the work done - the kids love them! the wiggle time video in particular scores in that it manages to work on the attention span of the youngsters. all the songs are short enough to keep them interested, and have catchy melodies and lyrics. a downside i warn adult buyers is that you will find yourself singing the wiggle time lyrics involuntarily! its inevitable. i admittedly have to not only sing a long, but have to dance too. its all but worth it when you see the little ones' faces - they light up like fireworks! so buyers/parents/doting aunties...get ready to wiggle! this is a definite must have."
5,You will NOT regret buying this!,"The Wiggles are absolutely the best thing to happen to children's entertainment...ever. My two year old is the kind that doesn't sit still for anything on TV, even Barney. The Wiggles has him hypnotized for the entire length of the video. I have to admit, I think they're pretty cool, too. OK, I love them. I sing the songs and do the dances (wow, will you get some exercise.)The only thing I would warn you on: Your child will become a Wiggles junkie. If you want to limit TV time, hide the video! And be prepared to hear, ""Mamma! Wiggles! Mamma! Wiggles!""Final word...BLOWS BARNEY AWAY!"
5,Bluesilian,"Tania Maria upgrades herself with each new album, fresh sound intelligently made for mature jazz listeners. She once more has achieved excellence."
1,Disappointing,"This is a rip-off. The quality of the movie footage is terrible. Most of the stills they show aren't even from the movies they are talking about. Most of the red carpet footage seems to be from the 1999 awards. They even get facts wrong, such as stating that Meryl Streep won an Oscar for ""Silkwood."" This is just a cheap, shoddy product. Read Damien Bona's Oscar books instead. They offer great insight."
2,dissapointing purchase,"I too was very dissapointed, i went into blockbuster video to see if i could find extra dvds for the dvd video game scene it, and ended up buying an academy award collection, to relive some of the reactions to stars winning their oscars and some acceptance speeces, and all i got was a recap of who won each year, i already have the oscar books, it almost seemed like they were not allowed to show the acceptance speeces, they talked about michael moore's controversial acceptance speech, but never showed a clip, the only clip they showed was very little about the man who ran across the oscar stage naked one year, adn showed very little of that was well, not that i really wanted to see it, very dissapointing, i wanted to see speeches, and stars sitting in their seats, and i got very little. They really need to come out with something better for academy award fans, they have a video cassette with stuff from the ceremony up till 1991, but nothing after that."
1,terrible bag,"I purchased this bag and returned it. It is very disappointing in appearance, materials and workmanship."
4,"Forget this, if you want the best and most comprehensive TRY","THE KING OF ALL MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS!!!!!!!!!Problems in Mathematical Analysis (Hardcover)by g. yankovsky (Translator), B. Demidovich (AuthorPublisher: mir publisher; 4th Printing edition (1976)ASIN: B000GTC2GA"
2,Disappointing,"I've been an avid follower of the Doc Ford series, have enjoyed all the previous installments, and have enjoyed the way he has developed his characters and his ""voice"". This one just put me off. There has always been a dark side to these books -- understandable when your hero is an ex government assassin. This one seems not only darker, but seems unrelieved by the conviviality and ""humanity"" that marks the rest of the series. The action, which has in the past been mostly believable and realistic, in this book seems to lean more toward teen-age fantasy. Disappointing and puzzling."
5,Good professional look and value,"Leather is classy, multi pockets very usefull. Well designed.Leather a little stiff at first but loosens up with a little use. The price makes this a winner over any case at Office Depot, Best Buy, or other venues."
4,laptop case,Very nice bag. Quick shipping . It has plenty of compartments to store your stuff in and is very well made. I think I will like this product.
5,Best of the Best,"The best video from the best kids act. Grownups will be surprised that they sing the songs in the car, at work, while shopping - without the kids around!"
4,Very Catchy!,This video gets a 7/10. The songs are catchy and the dancing is good. This is an older video with basic sets instead of the computer genereated stuff. Its a good video for the collection.
4,This is a kooky video but your kids will probably love it.,"My three-year-old daughter loves this video and asks to watch it over and over. Although most adults think the Monkey Dance is the best song, it isn't even her favorite. She likes the puppets, although I can see why another reviewer's son thought they were scary. I thought this was going to be a dud after the first viewing, but was surprised by how much my daughter has grown to love it. I am back to buy the Wiggle Time video for her tonight."
3,Scary Puppets,"We just opened our DVD last night, having forgotten about the comments regarding the puppets. But I knew exactly what was going on when our 23month old son who LOVES the Wiggles came rushing to me. Those dolls are freaky and they're in a couple of scenes, so I couldn't leave the room for too long before I heard the whimpering from my son again. Now I'm on a quest to figure out how to edit out the scary puppets from the DVD, because he really does enjoy the Wiggles emensely. But I have to say, this has put a damper on our ""Yummy Yummy"" experience."
1,lNot what I thought it would be,"I was looking for a video distribution system whereby I could take two or more inputs, like satellite system inputs and program out put to what ever channels I wanted to my network in my home and shop. This product does not do this.GTNesvold"
3,"Not exactly what I was hoping for, but still entertaining","Although this book was a fun and entertaining read, the stories were just too brief and not very spooky. The book does deal with some interesting stories, such as the Phantom Drummer of Shiloh and the Phantom Horseman of Little Round Top. There are also a number of stories dealing with premonitions, most notibly that which Lincoln had shortly before his assassination. Would have enjoyed a much deeper analysis of these stories, including more reference to contemporary accounts. Still, it's not a bad book and if you are interested in getting a copy, there are many out there on eBay and the like."
5,Great album,"Well, I am a HUGE fan of Stephane Pompougnac and this album is, in my opinion, fantastic, just like the costes series. He doesn't disappoint. I especially love tracks 5-8, but really all the tracks are good, and different in their own way. Way cool!"
3,"Size isn't everything, but it sure helps.","I don't see how you could describe one of these asdfasdfg things as a ""Weawy Widdle willy"". I purchased a set to ""clean my pipe"" as it were, and was pleased to discover that they were a uniform six inches long, in accordance with the national average.I wouldn't necessarily call them ""Cute and cuddly"" either, but to each her own.I can only rate it three stars however, because although adequate, it wasn't an eye opener for me."
2,"Too Widdle, too late.",Not as good as the fjdksfj Pipecleaners. Too small and the package arrived late.
1,Worst book I've ever read.,"Wow. It was bad. I have no idea how other people rated this book so well. Did you read the same book I did?! The stories were so random, with no points. I get what Maile was trying to do, but it really missed its mark. It was like taking random chapters from random books, putting them all together, and calling them short stories. This book was terrible. I struggled to get myself to read it. I would never recommend it. Save your time and money."
2,Beautifully written for the lover of short stories.,"If you enjoy short stories, Maile Meloy is the way to go. She describes people in depth, with just a phrase or two. It's really quite genius.""She is beautiful, and sparkles like jewels when she is wearing none: skin like gold, white teeth and clear blue eyes."" - Aqua Boulevard""Sometimes my son has a face like a storm, and then it clears, and again he is the most attractive child I have ever seen."" - Aqua BoulevardBeautifully written for the lover of short stories."
3,Not for me,"Feel bad about giving this book only three stars. Williams is an intelligent writer and his novel has its moments. But this magical realism lark is really not my cup of tea at all, and after about two hundred pages I'd had more than my fill."
2,To sentimental,"No doubt about it Niall Williams proved himself a wonderful writer with Four Letters of Love. However, as well written as, As It Is In Heaven is, the story is way to sentimental. Too many words saying the same thing over and over again. --Kathleen Butzen"
5,A different look at love,"I found myself puting this book down to savor its beauty...though perhaps the writing is a bit ""hit you over the head"" I enjoyed its clarity AND obscurity. That we never understand what love is, and that everyone can be afraid to beileve they are capable of love. I especially liked that Stefano never forced Gabriella--he wanted to make himself happy, and by doing so perhaps allowed her to be happy to. Happiness is a gift we give ourselves. Allowing ourselves to be happy is a key factor in this book, and one that inspires the thoughtful reader to turn inside and find out how to make their own happines.. I truly enjoyed this book."
5,Splendid.,"Next best thing if unable to go watch it on stage. The movie is great, the acting is phenomenal but nothing replaces the pure joy and perfection of these songs being sung by proffesional vocalist. Alfie was the perfect Jean VaL Jean after Colm."
1,WORST EVER,"This show has NOTHING to do with the 10th Anniversary one. The 10th is absolutely awesome, with much better singers. Especially Marius. Whose idea was it to cast Jonas as that important character? He is a joke. He has the voice (if you can call that a voice) to sing light pop songs, NOT for an opera ike this one. If you want a truly beautiful rendition, get the 10th Anniversary. It was a gorgeous show."
1,Not what I thought it was,"Although the performance is good, I expected the 25th anniversary that aired in PBS to be on this disc. I was sorely disapointed."
5,THE CONCERT AND THE ORIGINAL CAST ARE GREAT,"The concert brings together the great performers of the key roles in different productions; having seen the original on Broadway the year it came on stage, seeing and hearing some ot the outstanding actors/singers of two eras is a touchin experience. Great performance for a Great Musical based on a Great book."
5,Fantastic,This production was amazing. The energy created by the performance was amazing. Great staging. If you have or have not seen Les Miserables you will love it all
5,The best musical ever!,"Complete, very satisfying, almost indescribable experience; the only mistake I made was to choose the blu-ray version. Of course, I ended up limited to my living room where I had the blu-ray player. Later I got MP3 files and I also converted the entire video to my ipad."
3,Get the 10th Anniversary Concert Performance Instead!!,"Unfortunately, having grown up watching and listening to the 10th Anniversary Les Miserables in Concert, I found the 25th Annivesary performance underwhelming. I think my main complaint was the casting of Nick Jonas as Marius. Although a decent singer, the 17 year old pop star did not have the skill or emotional depth that was required to portray a leading man's struggles with love and revolution. The highlights were definitely Lea Salonga's intriguing return as Fantine instead of Eponine and Alfie Boe's vocal talents. Encore performances by the original cast at the end of the show were also a treat. However, if you want to see this musical's performances at its best, I highly recommend the 10th Anniversary in Concert instead!"
3,Nick Jonas... Are you Kidding Me?!,What in the world were they thinking when they cast Nick Jonas as Marius??? Terrible idea. He doesn't have the proper broadway vocals to pull of the part. He ruined the part completely! Sad because the rest was wonderful. Just can't beat the original cast though...
3,Not wrapped as a present,"I ordered this DVD as a birthday present for my friend, and paid additional fee for wrap. But it's NOT in gift wrap and didn't have any message card as well. I don't know if it's due to the Saturday delivery that leave it not time for wrap. Any way, I will never try gift wrapping again."
4,Almost awesome,"The new production cuts down on some of the songs, reducing the number of songs. The negative I can see is the fact is the Val jean is touch too operatic and distorts from some of the feeling that goes into the role, and Nick Jonas obviously didn't have the training to hold so many sustained notes so ended up obviously needing air and having to take breaths between notes where there shouldn't have been. However, Samantha Barks, who starred on the BBC show I'd Do Anything where she was a third place contestant for the role of Nancy in Macintosh's revival of Oliver!, performed the role of Eponine beautifully. Also, we have once again Lea Salonga performing, this time in the role of Fantine. The kids who were Gavroche and Cosette performed quite well. Overall a fairly good production. Perhaps not as good as the 10th anniversary but still worth collecting for the quality of the overall performance."
5,Awesome,I bought this for my daughter because it had Nick Jonas in it. She takes the laptop with her everywhere so she can watch it.
5,Great for those who can't see the show.,Closest thing I've got to seeing a live production. The cast is great. Samantha Barks is particularly enjoyable as Eponine.
5,Like being there,This is a wonderful way to relive the on stage experience of Les Mis. There are outstanding performances by several of the past and present cast members.
2,Region Code Error,"This is probably me being ignorant of these types of things, but I would have liked a more visible warning about the region code upon purchase, as it makes it impossible to play the DVD in Norway. The concert is probably fabulous though."
2,Very disappointed!!!!,"I thought the performances were going to be more realistic. What does Jonas has to do singing with all those actors-singers????. It is hard to believe!!!. When I go to a live play or musical the least thing I expect is to see credible performances and let me ask: who is going to believe that Salonga is the mother of a blonde child?, besides she still has her strong accent even when singing that I thought I was hearing to Pacquiao. Samantha Barks should be Fantine, period. Other point I want to said, most of the performances were just to step on the front and sing like when you go to a high school festival and listen to the students. The majority of the protagonists didn't act at all.Honestly, I don't recommend it."
2,good musical,its nice and good musicalthere is no word the cast and chorus are greatthe lighting and stage effect are nice to see on the big flat screen
1,did't work,Didn't realize it was formatted for German dvd players only so unable to play on my dvd. Would have been nice to know this before I purchased.
3,A mixture of great and not great,"I question the directing and some of the casting for this 25th outing -- you have the incredible Alfie Boe and then you have just about everyone else.Jean Valjean: Alfie Boe -SUPERB!!Javert: Norm Lewis - JUST OK; TOO STIFF, EVEN FOR JAVERT -- I ASSUME THIS IS A FAILURE IN GOOD DIRECTINGMarius: Nick Jonas - OMG, THIS IS HORRIBLE!!!Fantine: Lea Salonga - A HUGE LETDOWN; NO EMOTIVE POWERS BUT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. -- I HOPE THIS IS A FAILURE IN GOOD DIRECTINGThénardier: Matt Lucas - WHY IS THIS CHARACTER PLAYED AS A FEY POOFSTER? -- I ASSUME THIS IS A FAILURE IN GOOD DIRECTINGMme Thénardier: Jenny Galloway - A TREAT!Cosette: Camilla Kerslake - RAVISHING BEAUTY IN ALL WAYS.Go to YouTube and watch Alfie Boe doing ""Bring Him Home"" and save yourself a lot of trouble (though I should add that the ""reunion"" songs at the post-production are great, where some of the original / early performance cast come back)."
5,terrific signing,"this version is a concert version, not the full production of the musical, so don't expect any acting. singers perform at microphones at the front of the stage. The singing is terrific and this format allows you to appreciate the music more."
5,Ship as delivered,Good quality in sound and production. The recording and cast are excellent and I will buy again from same series.
4,Lovely musical,I've seen this great musical twice before in London theaters. I loved the new re orchestrated music for the Royal Albert Hall event. Great music + spectacular show...
4,Les Miserables...WOW,"I loved this concert! I thought it was fabulous! The voices, and even though it isn't the show that you would see if you saw it on Broadway...the songs are the same! Sung beautifully and with as much passion as if you were in that era! I recommend this to anyone who loves the songs from Les Miserables! Great job! Oh, by the way...if anyone is wondering if Nick Jonas can really sing....Can he ever!!! He did a wonderful job! Awesome!!"
2,possession,i recently readthe book and whilst i did enjoy the style of the authros writing i found the book very hard to get excited about.it was a slow and unrealistic begining (the main character i also found very unrealistic). and it seemed to me to finish with untied strings... there were many questions raised and seemingly none answered.i didnt like the book at all but it is up to everyone to have their own opinion of what they think.
4,Pleasant and Relaxing Read,"While Mother Nature isn't too kind to either main character, the gentle flow of the plot, the character's dialogue and interaction had me not only wondering about the fate of the damaged marina/resort, but also the women, their friends and the lake community.The gentle spiritualism and quiet determination of both characters really played off each other well. I was rooting for Emma to make the deadline and for Nan to complete the restoration of her boat and her heart.I happily found myself relaxed and engaged with this story. If I see another book by Ms White, I'll be sure to take a look."
3,MORE Than A Multiple,"Although I had been informed of its great quality, I have been unable to define any difference between it and other similar products."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"This release isn't horrible. It's better than FRAGMENTS OF FREEDOM, but not as good as either BIG CALM or WHO CAN YOU TRUST. Yes, the singer's voice is different. Not bad. She has large shoes to fill. Perhaps if she were singing more inspired material people would like her more."
2,Not what I wanted,"I want to like this album, I know bands have to grow and evolve, but I cannot get past the new vocal. I feel bad, but I just can't. I also think the writing is pretty poor. I hope there are people out there that can vibe on this, but I'm not one of them."
5,Wonders never cease...,"Daisy Martey is simply wonderful, one of the most remarkable voices I have ever heard. I just don't understand why this album doesn't sell...one of the best- if not the best- albums by Morcheeba."
3,"Catchy yes, but I still miss Skye","There's good tunes on this album, but I don't like the new singer's voice as much as I liked Skye's."
1,Not worth it,"These recipes aren't useful, and some are downright silly and pretentious. This is the kind of cookbook you get as a gift and then never use. The author doesn't come across as very likeable."
3,Natural rhythms do not have enough natural melody,Laid back instrumentals do establish a mood but only a few tracks (like Hummingbird) have enough melody to distinguish one track from the next.
4,Pretty catchy,My daughter enjoyed this dvd while she was learning the alphabet (2-4 years-old) and the sounds the alphabet makes. The dvd helpfully reinforced what she was learning in preschool in a fun way.
4,entertaining,my daughter is 2 and watches this every morning. She has been a slow talker so I thought this would help her out with sounds and the alphebet at the same time. We have only had it for a week but she will repeat the sounds. So it's an improvement. I'll write another review if she starts reciting the alphebet soon.
5,Enchanting DVD!,"I purchased this DVD for my 3 year old after reading a review of it in a parenting magazine. It was on a list of ""must have"" videos. I then checked it out on Amazon and was amazed to see that nearly everyone (65+ people) had given it 5 stars. And I can see why! After only owning it for 10 days, My son can recognize nearly every letter of the alphabet, and knows the sounds that half the letters make. He just adores this video and asks for it repeatedly - which is great, because it's educational! The song is very catchy if corny, but we sing it in the car all the time. The repetition is fantastic for learning. Good Job Leapfrog!"
4,Leapfrog,I like this product because the kids love to watch it. For my self personally this was a recommended video to help children learn their sounds and alphabet. It is very helpful
5,enjoyable product!,"I bought 2 of these for 2 of my grandchildren and their moms say that they just love them! They are both 2 1/2 and are bright, lively children, and they have enjoyed watching ""Letter Factory."""
5,Fun video for the whole family.,"This video has been the most watched in our house. It never gets annoying and it holds the interest of all three of our children (ages 2, 4, and 6). The other videos of the series have been wonderful as well, and even after the skill is learned our children still enjoy the movies."
3,Contains errors! Needs improvement.,"I suspect that a lot of the parents who gave this video a good review did not watch ALL of it with their child. The video is visually entertaining and fun, but the spoken part needs to be redone. It simply is incorrect about how to pronounce some of the letters. L shouldn`t be pronounced ``Uhl`` but they say it that way over and over, and the R shouldn`t be said ``er`` and so on. Also, in every case, only the short vowel sounds are taught, A as in apple, not A as in ate. When I taught phonics, we told kids that every vowel says its name, plus another sound. It isn`t hard to teach that, and it is really important. Worst of all, few examples are given of how the letters actually sound in words. For example, they show us a letter M saying ``m m`` but they don`t bother to say a single M word. My 3 year old loves watching the video and playing the little game that comes with it, but I wish it were better."
1,"Noisy, Busy, Waste of money","I don't like my children watching TV so I wanted something simple that would pop up the alphabets and an item that begins with that letter. This one is very noisy, too many tihngs hapenning and does not keep our twin daughers (8 months) engaged. It's like watching cartoon network. Not good for your little one's eyes."
5,my toddler loves these,My toddler would sit in front of the TV to watch this over and over again. I love that she is learning from this. I am getting all of the leap frog DVD.
5,Daughter loves it!!,"I have wanted to get this movie after watching it with my nephew about ten years ago. Now my daughter is four years old and I thought it would be a great movie for her. She loves this movie. She loves to sing the songs, which is great because it is helping her learn all the letter sounds. She also loves the another LeapFrog movie, the ""Talking Words Factory"". I am so glad that I hunted this movie down and bought it. :)"
5,Letter Factory for my granddaughters,The description of this product was accurate.I previewed it with one granddaughter and am anxious to preview it with our older granddaughter (age 2)I think it will be a good help in identifying letter sounds
5,Better than Sesame Street,"This DVD as well as the companion DVD ""Word Factory"" teaches with simple catchy tunes, mnemonics, visual cues, and audio cues. Both DVD's address most learning styles. We have had several parents, who were impressed with our children's knowledge of the alphabet and corresponding phoneics, ask us for the information on these DVD's. Also, pick up the letter magnets for the 'fridge from Leap Frog. This is another way to reinforce the cues from the DVD's.In plain language--these three items will keep your child's attention, help them learn their letters and letter sounds, and won't drive you too crazy!"
5,Great educational movie!!,Highly recommended! My 2 year old loves this movie!! It teaches them how to pronounce letters in a very fun way!! :) It was recommeded to us by a children's speech therapist. We also got the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set which is also a great learining toy!
3,Fun but incomplete.,"I have a two and a three year old who love this video and ask for it all of the time. I love how it teaches letter recognition and associates the sounds with the pictures. However, I have a big problem with the fact that it only teaches one sound for each letter. Of course there are many letters that have more than one sound. I am afraid this will cause problems later when my kids are learning to read."
5,Amazing! I highly recommend this dvd!,My 4 1/2 year old and my 2 year old had watched this dvd 4 times and in that short amount of time the 4 1/2 year old had learned all of his letter and phonics and the 2 year old knew about half. I had tried a lot of different things with my older son and nothing seemed to catch on until this dvd. We've moved on to the Word Factory dvd and he's really having fun learning. Very cool!
5,Rapid Progress,My 3 yr old was having difficulties remembering and focussing on alphabets by using books or multimedia aids. However he liked this DVD from the 1st day and within 2 weeks he has the whole alphabet as well as the associated phonetics by heart. A truly excellent product for kids to learn the phonetics - even though the 'A says.....' jingle can get to be a little tiresome after a while! :)
5,Awesome!,"I bought this DVD for my two year old. I am a former teacher, now stay at home mom to two children. This DVD is so great. My two year knows ALL his letter sounds! It keeps his attention and he asks for this DVD all the time. This one is better than ""Go To School""."
4,Attention,"The video was the right length to keep my sons attention. Because toddlers get bored quickly. He really enjoyed playing the games after he had watched it, which is a plus, because that is what will get him to watch it again."
3,Not Appropriate for Under 18 Months,"I was disappointed with the LeapFrog Letter Factory. I bought this for my 6 months old son, because I read another review similar to my specifics. Although it initially got the attention of my son, it took only a few plays for him to get totally bored. Plus, the manner of teaching the letters are confusing and 'crowdy' to a baby younger than 18 months; and thus NOT recommended for a baby this age. I also did not like the incorrect pluralization of the word ""Fish""...as ""Fishes"". Yes, this may sound like a picky point, but I have known children to develop this incorrect pluralization of the word and its hard to get them to understand the difference."
3,"Nice product, poor description","It does not fit my 14.1"" widescreem laptop PC - it is both too wide and too long - even though it is listed as fitting 14-15.5"" PC laptops. Mine is a Thinkpad Z61t widescreen 14.1"". Be careful in determining your size as the Amazon descriptions are misleading. The RadTech website has more information - now I know."
1,Poorly Colorized footage,I had high hopes for this set but can't recommend it for 2 reasons. First the colorized footage is poorly done. If it had been done better it would have been OK but the color values are often incorrect and very basic with poor shading and depth of detail. The second reason is that the DVD's are very short in length. All this material could have probably been put in a 2 Disc set in one keep case. Multiple DVD's is a common practice to make the consumer believe they are getting their moneys worth.
2,"Any one have a map, magic marker, and a pointer.","There are some really good shots of actual combat, but the 2 D.V.D. set completely lacks any sense of the overall picture of the war. The actual conflict between MacArthur and the Navy, why Midway was so important,in fact the overall strategy of the Navy is never really explained. I would have thought the History Channel could have done better. The best part is the story of Bull Halsey."
3,good overall,"This is a good set overall, but the quality is uneven. Some of the footage is good original color film. However, some is either poor quality color because of the age of the original film or it may be colorized; I'm not sure. There is also a fair amount of repetition, slightly disguised by using zoom-in/out and mirror images. Whether colorized or not, I think the color adds to the realism and am glad I came across this. I still rate ""World War II the Lost Color Archive"" the best of this type followed closely by ""World War II in Color, the British Story"" and ""World War II in Color"""
4,A good WWII 5 DVD box set!,"This box set has 5 DVDs:Disc 1: The Atlantic Campaign (Pt.1) - Dunkirk, Battle of Norway, Bombing of England, Battle of Malta.Disc 2: The Atlantic Campaign (Pt.2) - North Africa, Monte Cassino, D-Day, Retaking of France (6 weeks after D-Day).Disc 3: The Pacific Campaign (Pt.1) - Fall of Singapore, Pearl Harbor, Battle of Midway, Solomon Islands.Disc 4: The Pacific Campaign (Pt.2) - Gilbert Islands, Burma:The Forgotten Front, Battle in Palau, Liberation of the Philippines.Disc 5: The Atlantic Campaign - Operation Dragoon, Battle of the Bulge. The Pacific Campaign - The Last Stronghold, Mount Hot Rocks.I don't know how they did it but all the footage are in COLOR!! Approximately 7 hours 30 minutes.If ""World At War"" is not going to be released I would have rated this set five stars."
2,A propaganda book,"I had hoped to find real insights from this book, but as soon as Herman started dropping McTerms such as ""conspiracy theorist"" and ""anti-Semitism"" it was impossible for me to take any of his points seriously."
2,"Beautiful flowers and projects, terrible directions.","I love this book to look at. The flowers are beautiful, and the projects are as well. However, the instructions and illustrations are poor. Some of them are photographs using dark fabric, so you cannot see what the directions are describing. I found it impossible to figure out several of the folded projects. I have done origami and all sorts of other craft, quilting, and sewing projects, so am not a novice to following directions. This book has been a disappointment because I can't figure out how to make all the things I see in it."
2,What can I say,The belt lasted after 2 weeks after one of the punched holes broken due to my large belt buckle. It is not leather. The merchant sent me a replacement belt for free but useless due to unevenly punched holes. Try it. You may have better luck with it. I think my belt buckle was too tough for it.
3,almost happy,The product was fine. My only beef was I ordered multiple items and they were not shipped together and paid shipping and handling on each.It wound up costing as much for shipping as it did for the product.I will not purchase again without a lock on S & H caharges.
1,Cheaply made,The belt is cheaply made with a very thin leather vineer over a fiber composit core. It will not hold up. The buckle slot was not cut as shown in photo.
1,Cheap belt.,"Cheap belt and it is not genuine leather. When I called for a replacement after the buckle hole ripped, they refused to consider one. Don't waste your money."
2,not bad,this belt seems to be cheep and the clasp seems to undo easier than I think it should. at time my buckle falls off. had to get a better one
3,"Decently written, but fairly regressive","I decided to read this book because it turned up on several lists devoted to the best crime novels of all time. Having read it, I can't say that I see why. The writing is good, but the mystery itself is not all that interesting, nor is there any real puzzle for the reader to solve, as the new evidence just happens to turn up when it is required to support the already long foregone conclusion reached by the main character.I did learn a few things in the course of reading this novel, though. First, in England in 1949, kidnapping and abusing a 15-year-old girl was considered a misdemeanor, not a felony. And second, chances are that the shameless little hussy had it coming to her because she was lying anyway.I found the latter aspect rather disturbing, actually, especially for a novel written by a woman."
1,Hamburger's writing lacks!,"After reading several reviews of ""Faith for Beginners"", my book club chose this as it's next book to read. The reviews used words like ""funny"", ""insightful"", ""profoundly moving"", & we were all looking forward to reading it. ""Faith for Beginners"" is NOT at all funny! It is quite the opposite in fact. It is a completely depressing novel with nothing interesting, powerful, memorable, meaningful or redeeming about it. The characters have no depth, with the exception of George, & therefore do not draw you in. The result...this reader didn't give a hoot what happened to any of the characters. It drags on & on, & you think that it's got to get better but it never does.All in all, Hamburger's writing was not creative, interesting, profound or...ANYTHING. The only thing I felt at the end of the book was angry that I wasted my time reading it. This book does not work, & Aaron Hamburger hasn't got it."
3,OK but not great,I would give this a better review if I didn't think they were ripping off Neurosis sound pretty shamelessly! It's a good record but in my opinion it doesn't even compare to the music Neurosis create. But if you like heavy hardcore by all means go out and buy this CD...
2,Poorly Done,"For those familiar with Jung's work, the scholarship and interpretation in this book will be disappointing at best. Jung's contribution to psychology is certainly portrayed in a misleading manner here and one can only wonder what prompted the author's uninformed ax-grinding. Jung's work is a much better source for the interested reader as is most any other critical study of his methods and ideas. A very weak and poorly done book on a fascinating topic."
1,Playing Devil's Advocate,"Methinks Noll missed the spiritual point entirely. For one thing, Jung never exalted himself; he exalted his Inner Woman. Nor did he ever consider himself a god (""the wise old man is an ape""); in fact, he wrote: ""The inititated man regarded himself, not as a god, but as a goddess."" Any person who has ""experienced"" the triad -- Freud, Jung, Hillman -- knows this simple truth."
1,Slanderous guilt by association tactics on every page,"This is the greatest act of scholarly libel of our age. Mark Noll's thesis seems to be that Jung himself, and his theories, are somehow racist and quasi-Nazi because Jung was an ethnic German of the upper classes who had some contact with the intellectual movements of his day. This is, of course, bunk. In no way does this prove anything about direct intellectual influences between proto-Nazism and similar currents of thought and Jung or his psychology. As such, this book is a vile slander trading on anti-German stereotypes, the same kind of garbage that was used to dismiss Nietzsche until Walter Kaufmann save dhim from oblivion some decades ago. Anyone with a sense of intellectual honesty should avoid this book like the plague."
4,Mostly pleased,"Beautiful clock, excellent fit and finish, the bells areway too soft. I was disappointed that I can't hear thebells better, had one before and it did not have thisproblem."
3,Lousy size !,"I bought this book because I couldn't find my original after moving. It's a great cookbook except for the size, it is a pocket book. WAY too small for a kitchen cook book. My fault for not looking at the discription closer, guess I will check out the used ones, maybe I can find a decent original. It rates 5 stars but I gave it 3 because of the size."
1,Raging Baloney,"Martin Scorsese isn't a bad fellow, and he has a lot of talent, no doubt, but his influence on young American moviemakers has been entirely negative. The galloping illiteracy of this film, the first of Scorsese's f-word festivals, has infected dozens of other directors and screenwriters, and has even spread to television, where we see a sewage backup like ""The Sopranos"" being acclaimed by many who should know better. The screenplay of ""Raging Bull"" is shot through with inaccuracies, and nobody who remembers Jake LaMotta performing on ""Car 54 Where Are You"" is going to accept him as a tragic figure. The real tragedy is the debasement of the English language and its inexhaustible variety by a film like this."
3,Raging Bull,"Boring. Why this movie was nominated for numerous academy awards is baffling. It is a disjointed story of a boxer who leads a deviant lifestyle outside the ring. Not worth the money, pass on it."
5,One of the best American films of all time,"I will not be redundant of the deserved high praise others have given this movie, and particularly DeNiro and Scorcese, except to say that I agree completely. Few reviewers have mentioned the stunning performance of Joe Pesci (in his first major film role) in which he perfectly creates a character who is hilariously funny, ultra-violent and a compassionate and caring brother. For the viewer, a great companion film is the Scorcese-DeNiro-Pesci work, Goodfellas."
5,The Best Film of the Decade,"""Raging Bull,"" nearly 20 years after its initial release, is just as potent now as it was then. After Scorsese's ill-fated ""New York, New York,"" the director desperately needed something new, raw, and vigorous. And this is it. Scorsese's direction and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing are brilliant throughout, but the film wouldn't command half as much respect without the presence of De Niro. For me, he exemplifies all that is great about acting. This is one of the finest performances ever, and Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are equally great. There's not much else I can say here. I can either talk about this film and spoil any surprises for you, or you can go out and rent it today. Strike that: just go out and buy the damn thing. It is an overpowering motion picture experience, and is one you will never forget."
3,Harry Potter l'Ecole des Sorciers,I was disappointed to find that this translation was heavily abridged. Many of the funniest descriptions were omitted.
1,Terrible Translation,"This is a terrible translation of a really good book. The translator appears to become bored with the story at various places and starts leaving out entire paragraphs and combining parts of others, interrupting the flow of the story. I can not imagine how such a bad translation made its way into print."
2,Way too thin!,"I bought this comforter in the King size. I originally wanted it because it was on sale for $20. When it arrived I couldn't believe how thin it was (maybe quarter of an inch thick)! This will be ok if you're looking for a thin comforter for ""off peak"" seasons but will definitely not do for winter (unless you live in Arizona or something). Was definitely disappointed."
2,Too basic - no help for me,"I am athletic but have never boxed. I bought this book looking for heavy bag routines,punching styles, workout suggestions etc. I did not find it here.I feel this book is very outdated. The graphics are very poor, the workout ideas are minimal. It seems to be aimed at women who are JUST getting into sports. Too much basic information (filler) from stretching to how to do situps."
2,Love for Sale,"I was anxious to hear some of the favorite old compositions from an earlier era, and was pleased to see a variety included in the selection. I was however disappointed with the albumn. Content was **** but voice quality was **. Susie has a smokey, soulful voice, but a little flat and monotone in some songs.(One Note Samba excluded) Perhaps additional vocals added to blend might help the composition quality. An OK CD but not one that will be played repeatedly."
3,It's good information but lacks depth.,"This book helpped me identify personality types of a few of my supervisors but as far as telling me how to deal with them, The answers the book gives was not what I wanted to heer. Example An authorative boss can be a real pain,very demeaning, bad for crew moral ,limit potential of employees. All it recommends is to submit and kiss his butt. I am a union steward and deal with suppervisors a bit so it could be useful as a refference but hard to read all the way through!!"
2,Spend your money on another book,"I bought 3 study aids to prepare for the NCLEX-RN and this by far was the worst. At first glance this book is great because it has so much material, but after getting further into the book I noticed multiple typos. The spelling typos were one thing, but sometimes the number of the answer did not correspond to the right answer. These typos just took some of the credibility away from the book and made me uneasy. I would recommend the book from Kaplan or the Flashcards from Mosby."
2,ok for practice,This is a nice book to help review the content on the NCLEX-RN but there really was not much of those application type of questions I needed for the exam. It helped me review the material but honestly other review books with questions were more helpful IMO
4,A Major Perk,"Yes, I confess it's a little difficult to open. Not that difficult- it just requires two hands which is kind of a bummer when you're holding a baby. HOWEVER, this item has a major perk. The loops stretch out pretty wide- wide enough to lock a closet with french style doors. Show me another cabinet lock big enough to handle that. Plus, unless your child is truly determined, you can loosen it just enough that you can slip a loop over one of the knobs one handed. So, it works for me in places where no other cabinet locks will get it done."
4,best cabinet lock,"we've gone through multiple cabinet locks, and I have found that they are either very difficult to install, or easily broken into by toddlers.This lock, though difficult to use at first, actually keeps my kids out. I don't use the acutal locking mechanism. I tighten the lock enough so that the kids can't get in, but loose enough so that I can slide the loop over the cabinet pull and get into the cabinet.By far, I think this is the most effective system, and nice because i don't have to drill holes into my cabinets."
4,A funny dark comedy,This is funny. Martin Lawrence is hilarious. I loved when his car windows were broken in front of the police station. How funny.
4,"A cross between ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Boomerang""","Mixing the formula from Eddie Murphy's ""Boomerang"" (a player gets played) and Michael Douglas' ""Fatal Attraction"" (guy is stalked by heartsick ex-lover) plays well here, but I thought the subject matter was a bit too heavy to be considered a comedy, even a dark one, especially during the climax of the movie. I liked this film, though, because I love Martin Lawrence. Della Reese is great as Martin's mom."
5,Vega Obscura's Mighty Berserk Fuere(Fury),"When I got the Berserk Fury I was so excited.The toughest part had to be the tail and head,because of the Charged Particle Cannon.It was hard because when the armor went up they were attached to little part,and keeping them straight to fit was HECK.Although tough,it was fun.Also the legs kept messing up.With the Dark Spiner they cause mass destruction as the Eisen Dragons.Oh yeah,the Dark Spiner has two double barrel machine guns,his spines,that when he uses can make a zoids Command System freeze or make the enemy zoid go against his own side.And last but not least two sniper type guns.He is now sold in an american model kit and he can attach with the Killerdome,but I haven't found the Killerdome."
5,The Berserk Fury: The Kids Dream,"The Berserk Fury is a VERY hard Zoid to put together. Only try to if you have put together numerous Zoids of ALL classes. For those of you who have watched Zoids New Century Zero, this Zoid is THE GREATEST ZOID AVAILABLE. The Berserk Fury is capable of using Charged Particle Cannons. These weapons are EXTREMELY rare and have to capibility of destroying an entire planet. But since your wanting a review on the model...Its capible of destroying Zoids with one blow. It's a must have for collectors and warriors. Its sleek design, powerful weapons, and durable armor makes it very popular. I have yet to get a hold of this Zoid, mainly because my local ToysRUs carries few because of the fact that once they get a shipment in, kids come banging on their windows before they open and threaten to tickle the employees by their toes if they can't have one. Keep it safe and clean and expect it to be worth more than your old baseball card collection multiplied by 3."
5,"Much more than a ""DJ"" game.","having not played the first two in the series, i can honestly say this is the best beatbox game i have ever played. However, i have seen many reviews that say this game is merely a ""DJ"" tool, and while i see their point, it is so much more... I've made completely original beats for songs, or background music for parties... Overall, if your not into music however, this game is not for you. But my love of music and all things creative, this is one of my top 10 XBOX games."
5,I love american dad,This was bought to add to my collection. I have to have them all. My sunday shows. I watch them all the time if nothing is on tv. great cartoon. funny as hell
4,"Great Saw, but needs improvements","I used this saw to cut angle iron (about "" x "") to build a support frame. Like others have said, the blade does have deflection, so be aware of that. The saw did do the job, other than on my first cut, I was only cutting about "" off the end of the angle iron and due that the blade started deflecting, the blade itself cut into it's own guide. No big deal here. My only complaint is that it only offers 1 way angle cuts - meaning that you can only go 0 - 45 on one side, which is useless when you are cutting 90 angle iron. I ended up using my band saw for those cut. If they improve on offering 45 cuts in both directions I would have given this review 5 starts."
1,Short threading,Tis would be a nice drain if the threading was long enough. Do not buy if you are using above the counter vessel sink. The threading for the drain will only be long enough when going through the sink only (like a recessed vessel sink.)
1,"the other guy wasn't lying, either","a) too short for vessel sink (though I matched the sink from same manufacturer, same retailer;)b) 2/3 cost of same quality unit at your local box storec) 3x price from contractor supply, not nearly same quality -- contractor supply's is water-tight around the drain, a big selling point.Just prior to throwing out my kitchen and eating in 7-11s for the rest of my life, I was advised not to buy a sink online, due to zero standards, proprietary threading, etc. I'm not hurting the manufacturer or retailer by saying: the sink wasn't the problem; finding anything that works with it online or at box stores was a waste of ~$18 billion and 387 trips for more useless parts. Get the best deal on a sink at Amazon, then walk it into contractor supply, save $18 billion and lots of gas.Walk into a box store, get swarmed by helpful employees. Say the word ""sink,"" ""pipe,"" ""water,"" or ""drain"" and watch everyone take off their aprons and quit right on the spot."
4,Very good adventure movie.,"I thought this was a good adventure movie. Stuart Granger does very well and his role reminds me of King Solomon's Mine, where he also performed admirably. Many people seem put off that Grace Kelly didn't shine in it, but it's clearly Granger's movie. Paul Douglas does a good job of playing himself. The scenery was great and the story was realistic. I liked it."
3,Teenage romance hits reality.,"Rumer Godden deals very sensitively with the issues of growing up in a culture that is foreign, in this case , India.The heroine falls in love with the gardner's boy who is not what he seems. This infatuation is mainly fuelled by her isolation and alienation for her father., and the consequences are very serious. Quite a serious tone compared to many of Rumer Goddens other books,but certainly wothwhile."
3,Streets full of water,"Berendt has made an extremely readable book out of some Venetian shenanigans and doesn't hesitate to name names. I had hoped for more 'atmosphere' to balance the scandals but that is available in other books. There's a convincing sense of immediacy and vividness of the personalities, family feuds, social climbing, and rivalries which only an insider could judge as to accuracy (and they're not about to go on record) so we have yet another picture of Venice to add to our gallery--a good read but no substitute for a visit! Sean d'About Amen"
2,Nice prose -- but there's no story,"My title says it all. Great writing. Clever dialogue. Nice descriptions of Venice. But there's no story in this book. Nothing to pull you forward other than a lukewarm ""leitmotif"" about the theater fire. Starkly different from ""Midnight"" because that book had a strong story that kept you turning pages -- with pleasure. When a movie bombs you tell friends, ""Wait to see the DVD."" As for The City of Falling Angels, wait to check it out of the library."
5,DEE -LICIOUS !,"Brendt's ""City of Falling Angels"" is a MUST, MUST read - providing you appreciate Venezia - its wonderfully readable historic past along with its tourist-y, sinkin' in the lagoon present."
1,One Trick Pony,"Seems that is what John Berendt has proven to be. (Although Margaret MitchellGone with the Winddidn't do too badly writing only one book; nor Harper Lee!To Kill a Mockingbird)I really enjoyed Berendt's first,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Eviland hoped The City of Falling Angels would be as good. Unfortunately, his portrayal of the people of Venice isn't nearly as interesting as his of Savannah, and the book never takes off.Revisit Midnight - a much better use of your time!"
3,FALLEN AUTHOR,"The format for MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL was so inventive that I looked forward to more of the same with this book, set in the environment that is uniquely Venice. Although many of the story lines were intriguing in and of themselves, it just did not come together for me, and on the whole I was disappointed. He is a good writer, so it was not a waste of time, but it isn't a book I feel I can recommend to others."
2,NOT - Midnight in the Graden of Good and Evil,"The premise of the book is good. But - Berendt fails to pull off the the connecting of rich characters around a central theme he did so successfully with Midnight. The book lacks continuity and lacks a beginning a middle and an end. One gets the impression that he took the template of Midnight and trys to fit Angels within the same format. He does not pull it off. The book is not quite a travel log, it's not quite a mystery and it fails to demonstrate investigative prowess. I was suspect of his ability to get the provincial Venitians to bare their souls to him. The book ends with a thud. If you start it and think it is worth sticking with against the hope that he pulls it all together with a climactic ending, you'll be disapponted ."
2,Another City - no angels,"It just didn't do it for me. Like so many other people, I loved Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. It was such a rich, unexpected book and came alive in the reading. But, I fear John Berendt had only one in him - one great story. He found a crime and a city and another series of characters, but he just didn't find the magic.Good writing? Yes. Interesting characters? Somewhat. Compelling plot? No.Maybe it's just that he tried too hard to make Venice new to his readers. Maybe he tried too hard to replicate the formula and twists of Midnight, even though reality didn't afford him similarities to work with. Maybe he just tried too hard."
1,There's no There There,"Okay, I tried for a month to get into this book, but finally just gave up and returned to the library. There's just no story there. It's as if the author was trying desperately to replicate his enormous success of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."" Although Venice is a fascinating place, descriptions of the scenery and ambiance can only go so far. The book starts off with a big fire in a legendary theater in Venice. But--it doesn't go much further. The people were boring and I found all those paragraphs of dialogue monotonous. It's rather weird how the author can turn up in a place--and a big dramatic event is happening. And everyone he meets is associated with the event. This is a book that I was really looking forward to reading but it's one that i simply couldn't generate any interest in. Sorry, John."
2,Not the Venice I remember!,"The author tells the story of Venice in two ways--by relating the story of the burning and rebuilding of the Fenice, Venice's world-renown opera house, and by describing some colorful Venetians and American expatriates he met while living in Venice. I was taken aback by some of the people he described, many of whom I felt were self-serving, obnoxious, and pretentious. The worst of the lot were Larry Lovett and Dr. Bob Guthrie who may have been friends at one time but who used the charitable organization Save Venice in a quest for power and to spew venom at each other. I would much rather have learned about the simple folk who populate this most amazing city. Take me back to Savannah (and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil)!"
3,Just okay,"Vivid descriptions of Venice, but the story falls short of expectations set from Bernendt's Midnight in the Garden of Evil."
4,Not a page turner but good enough,"Not as compelling as ""The Midnight Garden of Good and Evil"", but interesting enough. Using the fire at the Fenice Opera House as the thread, Berendt introduces us to an interesting variety of people, at the same time giving us a real feel of Venice itself. It helps a lot if you're interested in Ezra Pound."
1,A real dissapointment,BORING - My wife and I both put it down after reading perhaps 100 pages. Very dissapointing - not recommended!
4,Inside from the Outside,"This is a deliciously gossipy book about a small town which just happens to be one of the world's treasures. For whatever reason, people *talk to this author and provide insights into the heart of a city that few tourists ever really see for what it is. I read this book just after spending two weeks in Venice and found that it corroborated in great detail so many of my own impressions. Venetians talk about it, sometimes with mixed feelings, but they do talk about it."
2,Totally Unimpressed,"Having enjoyed Berendt's first book, my husband and I looked forward to reading his latest, much to our mutual disappointment. If I wanted to read local gossip, I'd pick up one of the rags at the supermarket. I've been to Venice, and wanted to read a book about this fascinating city which includes the political and cultural landscape. Unfortunately, this is not the one. It's a hodgepodge of unrelated anecdotes, none of which interested me in the least about people I don't care about or want to know about. Sure, there were some tidbits that shed a little light on Viennese society; but overall, this was a huge disappointment. The only mystery is...how did it get the good reviews it has had???"
3,Vignettes,"Guess I'm one of a only a few readers who didn't notice much difference between Midnight/Good/Evil and Falling Angels. Both are light, gossipy little romps through famous, exotic cities, built around a pretext of getting to the bottom of a notorious crime. Both books lack focus, and don't really solve their crimes. But their value lies in the profiles and vignettes that swirl around in somewhat formless fashion. Berendt is a decent researcher who tries to stick to the facts, which are often colorful enough to need no embellishment. He is also a capable writer. Sometimes fact is stranger than fiction. Reading City of Falling Angels is like visiting little corners of Venice piecemeal, an activity that can never be boring."
2,Is there a point to all this?,"This book is boring and almost a chore to read. While Midnight wasn't great literature, it was, at least, very entertaining. This book, however, seems to be missing a point, a plot, and any ability to sustain interest. What a bore!!!"
2,Typical Washington,The book starts out OK--and some of the concepts are impressive considering it was written in a pre 9/11 world. Then it seems like the author runs out of things to say and the tone of the book shifts. The second half reads more like a memoir and its purpose is to name drop. Yawn!
1,"if interested in current brain technology, don't bother","The book was quite dated the first time that I saw it 10 years ago, and there hasn't been one single modification to it in that time. Talk about retro...you should see the black and white pictures.At any rate, If you are looking for information on current mind/brain technology, I wouldn't bother with this book. It is definitely out of date."
4,Shot In The Hide,"...Beatty and Hackman are great, as usual. Parsons's Oscar is baffling to me; she howls and cackles throughout but doesn't do much else.What makes BONNIE AND CLYDE is Faye Dunaway. Her performance is beyond anything any woman attempted between WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLF and SOPHIE'S CHOICE. The fact that she didn't win the Oscar is stupifying.And she looks like a million bucks."
1,Thumbs down for Warner Brothers!,"Great movie! Lousy DVD sound quality. It has a nasty hum at times and is too quiet. I had to increase the volume of my dolby digital surround system to its maximum level, which under normal circumstances would get myself evicted from the premises. Another Warner Brothers DVD that has this problem is THE SHINING. I will be very cautious before purchasing any Warner Brothers DVDs from now on."
5,Bonnie and Clyde,"Had never seen this movie and I will be 70 tomorrow. Don't know how I missed it. Excellent casting, acting, script, and directing. Can't ask for much more than that."
2,Ummm...A Big Thumbs Down in Our Home,"I do not want to offend anyone who enjoys this...but my sons and I were really disappointed with this CD. It is not really rap - it's like Rap-Meets-Elevator Music.I enthusiastically told my sons that teachers have given this CD praise, and my 9 year old (after groaning though a few songs) said, ""Maybe those teachers have imaginary students!""Anyway, others may like it, and I would encourage you to try to hear clips BEFORE you buy. There are better multiplication CDs out there...ONE BIG PLUS! I appreciate the efforts of putting math and music together. Any way learning can be fun for someone is important."
4,The kids love it!,The kids really enjoy the music and want to listen to it all the time. They are picking up the facts without even realizing it! Loooove it!!!!
4,Tea Water,"We first saw and purchased this item in Canada and really liked it. It stopped working so ordered another one. We may order another as a back up, because it works just great for us."
4,Magnetic Hooks,This is an excellent product for your cooking utensils. It fits neatly on your refrigerator.Best of all it requires no nails or screws.
3,Magnets aren't strong enough,I ignored the reviewers that said this slid down the side of their textured fridges and bought it anyway. Unfortunately it does slowly slide down the side of our slightly textured fridge. The magnets just aren't strong enough. I ended up putting a second (stronger) refrigerator magnet right under each of the magnets on this rack. The extra magnets keep the rack from sliding down.
2,"Entry Level, Several Mistakes","If you are an experienced C# developer looking to move to Mono for Linux support, this is NOT the book for you. It is a very basic level introduction to development using Mono and C#. It also contains several editing and content mistakes including misplaced screen shots, and simple factual errors such as describing INSERT and UPDATE as DDL and SELECT as DML (they are all DML). Frankly I expected more from APress."
3,IFM Radio,"This product is absolutely what I have been looking for. I was particularly interested in the radio feature and the fact that it has other functionalities for my Ipod was a definite seller for me. I have recorded from the radio and love it.However, I do have one complaint as with the regular Ipod remote, the cord seperates from the plug that goes into the headphone jack exposing the wires which from experience with the regular remote will start to cause a short. I haven't written griffin about this yet but intend to and hope something can be done to prevent a short from happening.All in all, a great addition to the Ipod since most MP3 players are coming equipped with the control, recording and radio features.I would have given a 5 star but this seems to be a problem that griffin hasn't fixed. I hope they do so real soon."
5,Best little boombox,"I just bought this boombox (not on amazon)and it works great!! It has a very stylish design and is the perfect weight to carry around. It's easy-to-use buttons are great. The CD player works wonderful and the radio alsoworks very well. The sound is amazing. It works just as good, if not better, than my shelf system. It is also MP3 copatible. I have not figured out all of it's capabilities yet but so far it is just what I wanted. My only complaints are that there is no remote, cassette player (wich isn't that big a deal) and no subwoofer, but you get what you pay for. Highly recomended."
3,"so ,so Sony","Not a bad unit , sound is so, so( only megabass control)good mp3 set up shows folders, files and name of songs ( what you labeled them when you burned the cd, cd-r or cd-rw)no cassette player, very light weight and stylish,if you have the bucks to burn the Sony has its place."
1,Seller is a Thief,"Sony Boombox failed after 20 minutes. Seller tried to scam me out of a refund, saying I took the product apart. Thanks to Amazon for a guaranteed refund."
2,Beware MP3 CD-RW faults,"I was surprised to find that this Sony box was not able to play a particular ordinary CD-RW with about 65 MP3s written on it. (It was able to play a different one with about 150 MP3s.) A much cheaper unit was able to play both CDs, but skipped, which was what brought me to look at this one.Loading the CD-RW with 65 MP3s caused the unit to spin up, show that it was reading an MP3 disc, count to 65, and then suddenly shut itself off when it should have started playing. Two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior. I was unable to figure out what the difference was between the two CD-RWs that caused this to happen.Bottom line: buyer beware! This unit looks cool and the navigation works well, but it could easily end up disappointing you when you bring it home to play your MP3s. My search for a MP3 CD boombox as reliable as my Rio Volt portable player moves on..."
5,Every parent should read this book!,"It details in a clear, parent-friendly way the various developmental phases growing children go through and explains why it is so important that they be allowed to go through those phases. I wish this book had been available when my children were young! It makes an excellent gift to give to new parents."
1,The Best of Baltimore Beauties: 95 Patterns,Elly Sienkiewicz books in the past have been absolutely fantastic. I am disappointed in that this book is a repeat except for a few patterns (7). There really is nothing new here. If I had never purchased any of her other books I would rate it a 5
5,"Deceptively simple, yet powerful","The exercises contained in this book, are deceptively simple, but don't let that fool you. The motion is not unlike Taiji Quan or Bagua, only stationary. The exercise can be done even by seniors, as it does not require any straining.The techniques combined with the breathing, really do create a profound sense of calm, and a warm flowing sensation in the hands and feet. The second section of the book contains some great stending meditations.I highly recomment this book for anyone looking for a way to improve their health. I can not say this enough, the techniques are soothing, and flow almost naturally, at some points almost like Taiji Quan."
4,Kind of realistic,"I didn't expect much from this movie after I read all the bad reviews, but I have to say I really liked this movie. Certainly it is not a typical Hollywood Blockbuster - but to me it seemed quite authentical. The actresses are gorgeous and the performance is ok for an indie movie. 4 stars because I think the subplot is a bit ham and sometimes too long without any particular meaning."
3,Fun and Bright ... With Crime Mixed In,"I agree with the other reviewers who say this is a good Miss Marple mystery despite some of the later Christie books being of suspect quality. The characters, at least, are compelling and the mystery is an entertaining puzzle."
1,WORST mistake you'll ever make if you buy this DVD!!!,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would be top-notch and handled with a lot of class since it was touted as a 30th Anniversary Limited Edition. Boy was I wrong. The first thing I noticed when I slipped the disc in was a new musical score that replaces the orginal. This score is so overbearing that it completely detracts from the images on the screen. It is an ABOMINATION! I removed the disc after five minutes and immediately placed it up for auction. Thank God I found a willing buyer. By far the best version on DVD is the Elite Entertainment DVD. It should be considered the definitive version of the film on DVD. There's a reason why the Elite version is frequently on backorder and the Anchor Bay 30th Anniversary edition is always in stock...the Anchor Bay version is pathetic! If I could have given it ZERO stars, I would have! Run...run as far away from this Anchor Bay DVD as fast as you can. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Information Please,Could someone post a review on this version of the movie? Like does it have any special features worth buying? I have the millenium edition of NOTLD and dont want to waste 18 bucks on another version. Thanks!
2,To All The People Who Gave This Version Negative Reviews...,"You guys were right! A friend of mine bought this new version and it is laughable. All they did was screw up a movie that was already as near a perfect classic as you can get. To anyone thinking of buying this DVD - SAVE YOUR MONEY! Buy the limited release Halloween instead. With an improved picture and remastered THX sound, it's how a rerelease sound be done."
1,NON REGION 1 DISC,"I've been looking for a BD release of this to complete the series and jumped at the chance even at the price.Put it in the player only to be met with a message of 'Disc cannot be played because the player setup specifies a different region code'.Nowhere in the listing did it say what region this was for.Same way I got screwed on the 3d releases of RE:Afterlife and Saw 3d - Amazon never mentioned in the listing that it wasn't 3d on a blu-ray until after they shipped the listing suddenly now links to 'how Blu-Ray 3D works'I'd expect this if I'd ordered from the UK site which I have done for items I can't find in the states, but why would you sell an item that isn't usable to 99% of the public?"
2,Unnecessary,"All I got to say is that this edition was completely butchered. It was good for them to have the old edition on the same disc, but the new edition was very unnecessary. Why add ""new"" material to that that was already classic? That's like putting in a new chariot race in Ben-Hur. The images look great, there is no fuzziness on this disc at all (the main reason why I give this two stars). If you want to see a new edition of this movie, this is for you; but if you want to see the original in its entirety, avoid it."
3,Scared the heck out of me,"Having seen this movie for the first time in 1998, I was surprised at how graphic certain scenes were. Overall, for a low budget film, it is truly a classic. Surprise ending."
2,No 3-D glasses included,Forget about this product. Does not include the glasses needed to view. No mention in the box or product descript on where to purchase the correct glasses. no mention on the product description on Amazon that the glasses were not included.
5,Zombie Film Classic,Awesome movie! Arguably one of the best zombie films out there. This will make a great addition to your collection
1,A truly repugnant embarrassment for Russo and Anchor Bay.,"I am a filmmaker and fan of NOTLD. I have never been so offended by a ""special edition"" of a film in all my life. The new scenes are poorly acted and edited, the new score is a laughable MIDI nightmare of its own, and the sound mix has been worsened by bad sync and poorer sound effects quality than the original back in 1968. To those who willingly particpated in this travesty- shame on all of you."
1,Say it ain't so George! Zombies must be behind this,"You'd be much better off buying Madacy Entertainment's poor-quality,budget-minded version. At least that version maintains the integrity ofGeorge Romero's vision. Anchor Bay's so-called ""expanded and enhanced"" version consists of 15 minutes of the most horrible acting in the history of American cinema. The new ""score"" doesn't score at all. Worse yet (and that's saying a lot), the DD 5.1 soundtrack relies too much on the center-channel giving the new dialogue (HA!) an unrealistic ""tinniness"". The transfer quality shows signs of neglect near the bottom of the screen in certain sequences. Buyer beware: spend your ducats wisely. Purchase the THX Digitally Mastered Elite Entertainment version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" rather than this. Long live DVD!"
3,only ok,"This 30th anaversary edition is the great film we all know and love ruined by some sub par acting. In addition to the poorly done new sceens a new sound track has been added. The sound track is good and goes well with the film but the new sceens ruin this classic. The picture and songund quality have been improved which,some would argue is a bad thing,in my opinion realy help. i give it 3 stars because it is a good film but the new sceens are a discrace."
3,A Little Better in Color,"The classic zombie movie of which George Romero started a chain reaction of living dead titles. This is the same 1960s story, but in better color than previous attempts from various distributors. I recommend it mostly just for avid collectors, but many people love the story. It's okay."
1,It's enough to make a grown horror movie fan cry,"I thought adding color to this classic of the horror genre was the worst that could ever happen to it, I was wrong. The new footage stands out from the rest of the film (in a bad way), almost all the original zombie footage is gone and the new zombies should shut-up because they're far too noisey,the new folley effects are as subtle as a train wreck, and the new soundtrack is nothing to write home about either. As they say in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" enter (or should I say view) this new cut of the film at your own risk!"
3,watch out not the original,"I had not planned to buy this. I got the millenium edition and i thought it was great. i knew this was a different version. But when i found it used for about 3 bucks I decided I would check it out. It is very different, it features a new begining and a epilogue, also several new scenes in the middle with different zombies, other changes are the radio says different things and sounds are changed here and there, also to make room for the new scenes old scenes were cut, such as, some of the story telling lots of talking scenes in the middle also the nude zombie is gone. its not as good, but it is interesting to see the new scenes and the special features are ok one more commentary for the film with several people who worked on the original, and were not present in the millenium edition commentaries. overall i wouldn't pay full price but if you find it cheap like me pick it up."
2,Too much and too little,"...Too much money for too little product. This overpriced DVD comes in short (about 30 minutes) and cheap. (You're not going to believe the shoddy production values). While it is useful to see good to great swimmers executing Mr. Laughlin's techniques, there is no info on correcting common problems for the rest of us. C'mon Terry, you've been teaching for over 20 years. What about a ""5 most common mistakes"" section that could help the rest of us along? Also, while it shows the recommended drills, there is surprisingly little on linking the drills to actual swimming. Most of the demonstrations don't show the swimmers even breathing but rather holding their breath as they execute the drills. (Yeah, I know, Sweet Spot - but that hardly shows how to link strokes, particularly for alternate side breathing). Also, unless my DVD player has developed hiccups, the disc itself has got problems - There were a number of stutters and ""freezes""."
4,Playful and attention getter - but dangerous,"My little 6 month old loved this. He was very attracted to it and learned quickly how to work it. Then one day he was playing with it and started screaming - his finger got stuck between Cookie monster and the cookie. After pulling his finger out we noticed a gap between them just about the size of a 6-9 month old finger, and not only that, but if your little one has his finger stuck and the same hand is pressing on the button it takes some strength to yank cookie's head up to release the finger. Beware!!!"
3,Needs more magic,"What's a Barbie to do? On one side there are the stuff-struttin' Bratz, on the other there's Cinderella, poppin' out product like she's a slave for, gee, some giant entertainment empire. Lost in the middle is Barbie, who has lately been trying to jump-start her career with these computer-animated ""Fairytopia"" films.This one's not bad. More than just sugar-sweet marketing muck, it has bright, colorful visuals and a real story filled with good messages. As for the animation, it's much better than most direct-to-video releases. On the downside, the story is dense and the pace is mighty slow: I fell asleep watching it! But if your little girl already likes this series she'll probably go for it."
4,Not quite over the rainbow...,"This movie was very entertaining, but I don't like it as much as I liked the other two fairytopia movies. The way they tried to throw in hip, modern phrases grated on me. (""fairy school"" ""dorms""for example.)It just lacked the simplicity, charm, and another-world fantasy that the other two did. Fairytopia and Mermaidia portrayed living in a whole 'nother world that consisted of fantasy and fairies much better than this one. It's still good, but there's not as much adventure. It's more of a mystery movie...you know, ""what's going on, how's it happening, who's behind it?"" (even though we all know the ""who"") Elina doesn't look nearly as pretty in this one...her face is so pasty, and she almost looks like a different person.Still, it had some good parts in it. Elina and Linden's romance was sweet, if short-lived. Including different kinds of fairies...""oriads"" ""Sparkle fairies"" was an interesting plus, too.Not my favorite, but still good."
1,"paid but ,never recieved","I did not want to rate this transaction but you insist, let me tell you that I paid for this DVD 2 months ago but I never recieved it despite my insistance to communicate with Bollinger books, the seller."
1,Amazon sent a filter that does not fit my 2010 Honda CRV,"Amazon sent a filter that does not fit my 2010 Honda CRV.The K&N; filter that they sent me was much too large to fit in my Honda.I don't understand this because when I ordered this filter Amazon asked me my make. model, year, etc?I was very excited when this came in the post. I thought I could be responsible and have a re-useable filter when I ordered this K&N; filter and this was about 4 times more than the Honda OME filter I had to buy at the local Honda dealer because they sent me one that does not fit.Very disappointed.I hope Amazon will take this and the oil filter I got from them on return because they sent me both items that in no way is for my car."
3,"Strong Evidence, Too-Thick Writing","I like that Weinstein sought truth over politics, but found his thick writing style very laborious. I also think Hiss was guilty, but the lust of right-wingers to use him to attack the late FDR aided Hiss' defense, and inspired such niceties as McCarthyism and State Dept. purges. Like Oliver North and O.J. Simpson, Hiss cried ""political persecution"" to dupe much of the public, but Weinstein makes a strong case against him."
3,Almost a Blue Plate Special,"I've read both of his previous efforts, loved ""An Ocean Apart"" frowned over ""Starting Over"". This book I enjoyed for the development of its principal character. The motivations and decisions that Dan Porter made were clear to me. I could only give it three stars as I felt some of the characters were superficially developed. His wife Jackie for example, I had no sense how she felt about her children, what motivated her to not consider custody of them, what was so attractive about Stephen. And Kate, the pivotal action she took was out of the blue, Maxwell Borthwick was a flat caricature. All of this aside, Pilcher has a lovely way with words, an adept, preceptive and warm manner in his presentation of children and adolescents, and wins me over every time portraying friendships of kindred spirits. I have to admit to taking him as he came, I haven't read any of Rosamund Pilcher's books, if having that name before him enhanced his being published, I am glad for it."
3,Jimi Hendrix Dick Cavett Show,"The Jimi Hendrix Dick Cavett Show is of course very short. But still the DVD gives you the full performence of Jimi Hendrix at the Dick Caveet show which is also very short I think Hendrix only plays like 2 songs Izabella, and Hear My Train A Comin. Experience Hendrix provides as much as they can Experience Hendrix does just want to cash in for the money. I dont wacth this DVD that much because its very short and to me Hendrix isnt really trying to play on this cause he was very tired from other shows and concerts. I rated this a 3 if your a Hendrix fan then you prob. would like to see this short film. If your not then dont even think about buying this!!!!!"
2,Hendriks?,I thought this DVD was a little drawn out with interviews from people that new Jimi other then himself and very little performance.
2,"Too chatty; no data, no drawings, poor bibliography.","If you have heard Weisman speak on NPR there is no reason to read this book. If you want to espouse the eco-cause you need to back up ideas for change with data, drawings, annotated biblography.For a journalist, Weisman is too uncritical in his analysis of the problems found at Gaviotas. There may be wonderful things happening in the llanos (especially the reforestation), but little of it seems capable of transfer to other settings. His anti-capitalist bias keeps him from doing cost/benefit thnking, much less analysis. Also, this has far too much ""dialog"" reporting, so that it is neither fiction nor journalism."
1,How to draft basic patterns,"I feel that not enough information is given on pants. When explaining the draft for pants or slack it refers continuously to the skirt. Also, it is to confusing in trying to explain how to draft a pattern."
3,strange collection,"Yet another collection of Willie's early material, which is excellent. On the plus side this one gives you a lot of songs, including some that aren't on other similar collections. But it loses points for two reasons. First, there is no recording info for the songs (not even the year). Second, it's 3 discs but the songs would have easily fit on 2, so they're just wasting discs for no reason."
2,Kasparov is just a lot of talk !,"Plain & simple, Kasparov has super computers doing all the work on finding Fischer mistakes in this book. Computers are the steroids of chess. Todays players cannot be judged equally because of this. Fischer, and prior chess masters, had only their minds and that is why they will continue to be known as the greatest natural players of all time."
3,Enjoyable but Kasparov has an ATTITUDE!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It it different than the other two books I own on Bobby Fischer. The games are good, the analysis is good (not for a beginer though) but the problem seems to be that Kasparov tries to make himself look good (like he is god's gift to the world) by trying to make Bobby Fischer look not so good. Kasparov writes with an attitude!"
3,A Chore,"OK, so this is considered a classic of the genre because of Dunne's ability to build upon a real life mystery. I can see how this might have been different when it was written given the dialogue, explicit content, and pacing. I appreciated some of these elements enough to keep going.Even as I kept going, however, I did not see how these features alone make a great book. Dunne's dialogue and repeated short sentences are just as annoying here as they are in ""The Studio."" If you like: He walked outside. It was raining. ""Hey there"" type language, this book is for you. If it makes you cringe (or dizzy, try reading this on public transportation) after a while, then I suggest you avoid it.The explicit content isn't bad, but the racial jokes get old after a while and are overused. Meanwhile, the pacing is such that by the time the police solve the mystery (by doing, really, regular work), you may not care anymore.It is worth reading, but it may not be enjoyable."
2,Raunch.,After talking to friends (one said she stopped after 40 pages) who were reviled by the language and images in the book I decided not to read it. There are too many great books to read without wasting time on this one.
2,Not like advertized,"I have these Memorex CD-RW and Sony CD-RW. The Sony works everytime and the Memorex work once in a while. The reason I believe is the recording speed. Sony has 4X recording while these have 12X recording. The 12X recording is unplayable on my car stereo 8.5 out of 10. Unfortunately, I can't adjust the recording speed with my Roxio 9 program. The CD can't be played or played with a lot of statistic noises. I think if I record with a lower speed, it would probably works well. Therefore, the product was advertised incorrectly when it say it is capable of being recorded up to 12X."
1,Five to the drain,"Tried one by one, none of them worked. after the burning is done, I can listen to the first 2 tracks fine and then nothing. tried each single CD with the same outcome."
1,Don't buy,"It can be burnt as music CD, but can't be read on both computer and CD player. I bought same product form target, and the serial number seems to be very different, however it works and this won't."
5,One of the alltime greats,"I stumbled across this book after listening to quotes from the book in a funkadelic song called: good thoughts bad thoughts. I am a true believer in self help books and this is one of the first and best. some other good ones are the power of believing, master key system and invisible valium."
5,A must have first book on how to change your life.,"One of the very fist books on meta-physics, is a simple version on how you can become the captain of your life, by becoming the master of your thoughts. It's a book to be read several times and to pratice it's simple teachings on a daily basis."
4,Packed with information,"The book was deliverd fast and for the price, new you can't go wrong. Plus, it's packed with useful information for todays man."
4,As a Man Thinketh,"Excellent information. This was shared for the first time with the world many years ago, yet it's principles and messages still hold true today! A must read for someone wanting to increase their state in life!"
4,A good idea explained in charmingly bad English,"This book was a very unusual read. The idea sounded very convincing, and the state of mind I was in after completing the book was clearly quite close to what the author intended. His reasoning was clear and made a lot of sense, despite the unscientific and metaphysical claims of the subject.I'm a bit perplexed as to why the bad English didn't bother me or get in the way. The author has an extremely limited vocabulary, and the book is full of mistakes (I don't know whether those are specific to this edition, or were retained from the original). Perhaps the amusing language actually makes the reading experience less serious and helps make the subject matter more accessible. It's hard to tell."
4,Tried and true theme,"well written, easy to read book that clearly explains the relation between thoughts and actions. Practical reading that explores ""I think...therefore, I am"" on a personal level."
5,AGREED!,"I can't add much to what everybody else has said here except that I couldn't agree more. It's a jewel of a little book.One of the best things about it is that it is so short. You could sit down and read it in an hour or two.It's so concise, you can read it again and again, and you'll want to. But don't let its size fool you. This little book packs ALOT of power."
5,wonderful book,"I love this book. It really helped me to understand the power of thought and what can be done when you set your mind to things. It's quick to read and has been life-changing for not only me, but a number of other people. If you're looking for more information on how to bring more money and prosperity into your life, this is an excellent resource."
2,Surprisingly I didn't like it!,"I bought this because it's considered one of the all time classics. I have to say with some surpise that it failed to inspire me and did nothing for me! I found the old English and style of writing rather bland, yet ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" is also written in old English and I'm really enjoying it! I also found ""Think and grow rich"" to be superb. I do not recommend this book, read the other two instead!"
5,A wake-up call to just about everyone,"""As A Man Thinketh"" should be on everyone's Short List of Must Reads.Inspiring, it clues the clueless into their personal responsibility in their life. I am not a pollyanna writer; I have also come from Rock Bottom, USA, nearly destitute. This book helped put me on the path to true success, prosperity, and sagacity."
5,Nice cap. Look cool while staying cool in the summer.,Very minimalistic. True black. Inexpensive. Breathes well. Good for summer. Wouldn't recommend for cold temps. Get yourself something else for cool weather. This is perfect for hot weather. Brim holds shape well. Has white mesh inside the front quarter of the hat so that it stays tall and doesn't collapse - unlike other inexpensive hats I've bought. Velcro on adjustable straps hold firm. Color hasn't faded over time.
3,Interesting Mix of traditional and stretching out,"""Ochre"" and ""Flashback"" are unusual and intriguing pieces; traditional hard bop on the rest of these tracks. Studio pro Dick Kniss on bass; Dick Berk on drums. Not an essential album but inventive enough to hold your interest."
5,Essential!!,"We just got back from a mini-vacation to Portland and it was one of the most enjoyable trips we've had. A lot of that is thanks to Mr. Barry's handy guide. We've been to Portland previously, but had not seen or experienced it the way we did this time. We would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is going to the area for the first time or even, like us, has been to the area before. We both probably still looked like tourists, but I bet that we experienced many things not normally experienced by other tourists, unless they had purchased this guide."
3,One Summer Night,"I have to admit One Summer Night was a page turner, no doubt it kept me interested. The one thing I didn't like is the characters. Jo and Kelly were shallow and I didn't have any feelings for them. I thought that they lacked real love, all they had in common was they enjoyed making love. Making love is good when its between two people who really love each other, and Kelly and Jo didn't. They didn't have time to grow into their relationship, it was based on how many times they made love, and they made love a lot. Never saw so many love scenes in my life, after a while it was typical of them. I didn't find this a true love story at all."
1,HORRIBLE Customer Service From Selling company,"Item was sent and it took more than 2 weeks to receive, they claim it was custom made. The seat covers weren't even close to what I had. Even the head rest was the wrong shape. I wanted to return the item and then I got attitude from the seller. This was a gift for Christmas, they drug their feet getting back to me (AUTO BARN) on wanting it returned. For 150 bucks and wrong fit I think I should be able to return it. FINALLY they said I could, then make me do all this other ectra stuff, pay for shipping to return and then drag their feet on getting me my money back. FINALLY I get an email stating I can have my refund but they shorted me $10 dollars. That might not seem like alot but I paid for shipping BOTH ways and then they short me!"

1,DOES NOT WORK,So far it does not seem to be working. I sent an e-mail to the company but did not get a response. I will call them in the morning.
4,A good read of a complex man,"We read the book in my book club. It was an interesting and easy read. The consensus was this was a good story but not exactly a nice guy, as portrayed.As novelized, Frederick Douglass was a complex man who had deep love issues. He needed two women to make him whole but yet never seemed able to show that love to either of them or his kids.Highly recommended for people interested in another look at a good man with clay feet.Averlyn Archergenesisartline.com"
1,Erroneous from first page,"As president of the New Bedford Historical Society and steward of the first free home of Frederick and Anna Douglass, I am appalled at the errors in the facts contained in this book..starting with the date they met to the name of the city that embraced them.Anna married Frederick and travelled to New Bedford in 1838 and was NOT pregnant. They were guests of black abolitionist Nathan and Polly Johnson in New Bedford, not Bedford, and remained in NB until 1842 or 1843,as documented by City records.When married in NY by Pennigton, Garrison was not present. They had not even met...These are just a few of the errors in the beginning of this book. I realize this is not a text book but to dishonor the memories of Anna and Frederick Douglass to sell books is unacceptable"
5,BEAUTIFULLY IMAGINED NOVEL,"With Douglass's Women, Jewell Parker Rhodes has once again given voice to the voiceless. In this novel, she vividly imagines the points of view of both of the women who loved Frederick Douglass, the great abolitionist.With writing that is both beautiful and spare, she gives us glimpses into the lives of Anna and Ottille. I left this book with a profound empathy for both women-- one black, one white. This novel goes beyond simplistic explainations and anlayses of inter-racial love and infidelity. Parker Rhodes is unafraid to wade into murky emotional and moral waters. This is a novel avoids judgement in favor of illumination and understanding."
3,Some explanations unclear,"I bought this book for a class and I wish I had not. I found myself using Pozar's Microwave book and papers/class notes since they were more clear. With that said, it does provide information beyond the Pozar book (since that is an introductory text) and isn't the worst book I've used. I guess if I didn't have the resources given to me in class I might have used it more."
4,great for damp rooms,works awesome for my small bathroom that isnt vented well. really helpful in controlling moisture and mold. been using for two years.
5,Well worth the cost.,Yes you need these for your dehumidifier...but they work great. We only use 1 a year during the times we have our Komfort Trailer in storage. So well worth the money to help keep the damp moisture and smells out of our unit.
5,Great!,"the author gave insight into the politics of the mental health field, from the philosopy of running private and public institutions to the competition between psychoanalysts, and competition beween the differant professions. From Reichman's story is written in the context of world history and the history and development of mental health treatment in the U.S.. All this plus the Freida Fromm-Reichman's philosopy and approach to analysis. The author provides a rich portrait embracing both the strengths and weaknesses of Fromm-Reichmann"
5,gret series,funniest show ever had me laughing all over again.and i have had just as much fun watching again as i did as a child.
2,Recommend another book for novice,"Dear fellow readers:I borrowed this book from a friend, who used it in a university course. It was said that the examples used in this book were not sufficient enough to get the grasp of the concepts. I am sorry to say that this is not the only problem with this book. Although this is very complete book from concept to application point of view, the problem lies with the road the authors have taken to explain those theories. The topics are simply skimmed over and not much elaboration given to both development of the equations and application of those equations. As mentioned above the examples did not clarify my confusion any further. This left me confused and not as clear a picture as I hoped to gather. Perhaps this book is best suited as a reference for a person who is well versed in this topic and not a novice."
1,horribel text,"This text is AWFUL!!! Unfortunately it is also the standard for many schools. If you have problems with this topic, I recommend getting the Schaum's outline series for Physics, Differential Equations, and Advanced Math. There you will find the necessary review material over conservation of energy, fourier, laplace, and solving DEs."
2,"Pretty lame, low-budget bore","How much did this thing cost to make? Not much, I would imagine. The cast mainly trudges through the snow in the woods, getting lost on the way to California. Hungry, they resort to cannibalism to survive. But the women, and even the men, look way too clean and healthy, their hair perfect and their faces ruddy. They were starving? Doesn't look it. Also, they appear to only make one meal out of each dead body they carve up. But, in reality, they could have survived for days, if not weeks, per body. The score is silly and too melodramatic. The acting is leaden. In all, a waste of time."
1,Not good,"These are over priced, they don't work good. They tend to cut the hair rather than grasp and pull it out."
5,It works great!,"For ingrown hair removal, this is a must-have tool. Also would make a good addition to any first aid kit. Ideal for things like tick removal too."
5,The second set of tweezers you should have available!,"I happened to run across these tweezers when looking for something else online. I quickly realized these would meet a purpose at home - besides ingrown hairs, they're excellent for pulling splinters and, a problem for me, nails that splinter on my hands and feet. Besides a regular pair of blunt edge tweezers, every home should have a pair of these around for those problems that the blunt edge tweezers just can't handle. The tips are just as sharp as they look so you do want to keep the little rubber tube over them when not in use to avoid accidental sticks. Well made, these are worth the price!"
2,ok,"It is what it is, but its not worth the price. Tip is already losing its point. I wouldnt recommend it again"
3,Pretty good...,"Tweezerman makes nice products. Although, this one is not one of my favorites from them. Kind of dangerous...!"
3,Nice idea,"I was let down by this product. The idea was nice but the execution did not come through for me. The makers claim that the ends are sharp but they are squared off. The ends appose reasonably well but are bowed slightly so in order to grasp a hair you need to squeeze fairly hard, that is when the ends slip past one another. I am used to using a stainless steel surgical grade forcep and these are nowhere near that level. Dissappointed that I spent this money."
5,Splinter be gone!,These are wonderful. Nice sharp matching points. Handle has wide area that makes it very easy to hold steady. Pulls the splinter right out. Will order another set to have one in the garage and one in the house.
5,Never Buying Anything Else,"These are the best tweezers you can buy on the consumer market. No questions asked. They are ridiculously precise and sharp to a point where you can easily hurt yourself. Every other pair of tweezers will go right in the trash after you use these. The Tweezerman company seems to believe in their product as they offer lifetime sharpening and repair. Be careful not to drop these though...The steel tip is very brittle and will crack easily. The warranty does not cover dropping, but they do come with a rubber cover for the tip. If you keep them clean and off the floor they should last a very long time."
1,"No, No, No","I have the regular tweezerman tweezers and I thought these would be even better. Not even close. They are sharp, and they will dig into your skin, but unless you get a hair exactly in their very,very tiny grip, you will just have a hole in your face and the hair will still be there. Save your money."
4,Good quality,I like the product. The materials used seem to be of good quality. It is what I had expected.
2,Too much tweezer for me,"I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me. However, I was only able to use this product for a short time. My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed, there was a tell-tale scab left behind. I'm not sure which was worse, the hair bump, or the scab. Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy the ends a bit every time I used it. I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an ""emergency"" in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional. However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;))."
1,Ineffective,The points allow you to work on exposing in-grown hair. But the tips barely touch so it's very difficult to grasp the hair to pluck it. There are other Tweezerman products that are more effective but I didn't see them for sale on Amazon. Found one that works at Walgreens (purple coated).
5,Great,"Work brilliantly, you do have to be careful with them as they are very sharp though. Definitely worth the money."
4,A classic reading experience,"All my life I have heared and seen movies about Dracula, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekell and Mr. Hyde. Normally I do not read horror/ science fiction but I was curious about these three and decided to find out how these literary characters attained such long lasting lives. The time spent reading the three books was worth it. It was an entertaining cultural experience.I'll leave it to the experts to try to tell you why they are classics. I don't know, but if you are always short on time, like I am, my order of preference is as listed in the first sentance above."
4,I love Frankenstein,"This was well formatted for Kindle. Dark, Gothic and broody at times. Shelley can still speak volumes to readers in this novel. Well written and and hopelessly addicted to this classic. READ IT."
4,Well worth the read.,"This was a very thought provoking book--precisely the kind of book that I enjoy. It was a very short, quick read. Frankenstein's story and his struggles were tedious and sometimes boring, at least until his wedding night. Frankenstein's monster's story and struggles were fascinating, heart-warming, tragic, and horrific. Well worth the read to get into the mind of the monster of Frankenstein."
3,"Read it for the concepts, not the writing","What does God owe us, his Creation? What are the responsibilities of parents towards their children? How should society treat its homeless, creations of its own policies? What happens when scientists (or even entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, politicians) pursue a single-minded goal of glory and wonder without stopping to think on the consequences?All of these interesting and relevant issues are raised in this plodding, poorly written work. The standards of interesting writing may have changed in the last hundreds of years, but some writers and poets are skilled enough with language that their work still endures. Don't be misled by the hype; Mary Shelley should not be remembered for her literary skill. I hope that no schoolchildren actually have to read this. There are enough great works that are enjoyable to read. Frankenstein should be classified as a work of philosophy, not one of literature."
1,"Harsh criticism for ""Frankenstein""","Great god! This novel is written so poorly, ssslllooowww, plodding, dry, dragging, flowery chapters. For those of you who are searching for a novel rich in literary content, bristling with metaphor and imagery, and full of gripping suspense, you've come to the WRONG place. This novel possesses none of these. Take it from me, a seasoned man of literature. If you're searching for strong philosphical ideas, on the other hand, you may have yourself a match! You'll have to possess superhuman patience and the inner desire to remain awake, however......."
1,YUCK! DONT READ IT ITS HORRIBLE,this book was soo boring i stopped reading it because the book took forever to get somewhere. WASTE OF TIME!
4,School Reading,"I was thoroughly surprised at the outcome of this book. When I was younger, people told me about how boring the book was and I definitely trusted their judgement of the novel. I couldn't get into it at the beginning so I read the synopsis. I'd only ever seen ""Young Frankenstein"" with my mother so I was thrown off by the story line which proved to be interesting at some (not all) points. I was impressed even though diction was extremely ""posh"" and flowery."
4,Not so dull,"Mary struggles to write with flair or salesmanship, and it's more documentary than fiction fantasy. However, she really philosophically ponders the monster-ness in us all."
1,Pointless and awful,"Why adapt a work of art that is genius into a boring superficial version? It's not as if the original Frankenstein is so hard to understand, as are some ""classics"" such as Paradise Lost. It's an easy read and full of poetic imagery. I do not recommend this version. I see no point to it. Even a child could read the original."
2,soso,"I thought it was boring, I made myself finish it because it is a book my teens are soon to read and I wanted to be able to give help where needed. It did pickup some after about half way, but still very dry I thought."
1,I thought Frankenstein was cool until I read the real story,"This book had a really good idea for a story. Too bad she couldn't describe feelings to save her life. Its amazing that in less than a year, a monster, made from dead criminals can learn to speak better than i have been able to in my entire life. By the way? Where did he get the pieces of dead people? Yeah, he just walked in the local morgue and picked up the pieces he needed. Sure. Well if you have any thing that you need to get done DO IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK. I didn't think anyone could make a 160 page book seem so long! And talk about repetative. Well I think I made my point."
1,This picture is EXTRMELY missleading,"No offense but the book I recieved looks nothing like this. It looks way older! I do understand that it is the same just different cover, but i wanted the one that looked like the picture!"
5,It's Not Your Father's Frankenstein,THis isn't the old Frankenstein story you think it is. THis is simply an amazing story written by a very young woman. I was blown away as to the emotional strings this book pulls. An absolute must-read!
5,A book one can learn much from,"I am an 18 year old college student, and I was required to read Frankenstein and analyze it. Being an avid reader, I never had much interest in Frankenstein and sighed at the thought of having to read it.At first, the book seemed like a difficult read, and I wanted to put it down immediatley. But, being required to read it, I went along with it.Into the first couple chapters, I became more and more interested. When the Creature was finally ressurected was when I had my epiphany.This book is packed full of messages regarding Knowledge, Passion, Regret, Sorrow, Selfishness, and Prejudice.Those who dislike this book must not have the mental capability to ""read between the lines"" and find the hidden messages that Shelley places.Overall, one can learn much about the value of life, and what it means to truly be happy."
4,"Damon Medic's Review of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein""","Damon Medic says If you believe ""Frankenstein"" is a ""Monster"" story, you need to read this novel. In fact, the real ""monster"" in this novel is Dr. Frankenstein, not his creation. This novel will make you feel emotions you never thought you would feel, based on your preconceived notions. You will probably cry while reading. Don't trust me; find out for yourself. Read Frankenstein, and you'll see what I mean!-Damon Medic"
3,Frankenstein,"I liked this book, there was an interesting storyline, lots of action etc. But nothing extremely WOW about it. But, don't get me wrong, it was a very good book."
2,Slow going...,"The book was fair, but the story seemed far-fetched from what would really happen.... You`re telling me that after all the time Frankenstein took to build his monster he was so freaked out he wouldn`t talk to it??? Lame!"
5,Frankenstein,"Thanks a lot for the book: Frankenstein. Even tough I haven't read it...yet, I am very thankful for your quick shipment."
3,Frankenstein,"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is obviously a classic. This book was one that I never thought I would find myself reading but the more I got into it, the more I enjoyed. The classic story of the man who creates his own monster out of anger and aggression, is portrayed somewhat differently than what most think. Unlike the movies, the monster is an intelligent man who knows what he wants, and the man who created him is just as smart. The book follows the main character through his life, past, and present and somewhat into the future. With exciting twists and turns and climatic events, Frankenstein will keep any reader interessted. This book will make you think, use your imagination and have sympathy for the main character. I would reccomend this book to everyone, especially those who are big fans of all the Frankenstein movies."
3,Okay,I had always wanted to read the Mary Shelley Frankenstein ever since the movie came out in 1994. The book was long & at times very boring.
2,"Not brand new, when they said it was new.",The book (that was purchased) wasn't in the condition stated by the seller. I could have bought a better book with the price I paid for this book.
5,Excellent,Although thus novel seems like a horror story at first glance it really brings out a great theme. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes to learn about the flaws of man and how others react to them.
3,A bit bland,This is an academic publication suitable for someone learning the history of religion. It is a bit of a dry read. This book uses footnote referencing which is a major plus because you can either read the references as you go along or get them in alphabetic order at the back.
5,I truly enjoyed reading this book.,"Based on my own intellectual interest, I was drawn to this particular book and was quite intrigued with the information that was presented forward to the reader. It was quite informative, with examples from different cultures and societies that practiced or practice shamanism."
3,Matches factory design for 08-12 Yukons/Tahoes/Silverados etc...,I bought this to install a Kenwood Navigation unit in my Yukon and everything went pretty smooth. The installation instructions are not very clear so I had to use a little trial and error to make it fit right. When installed the kit matches the lines of the factory dash very well and looks stock.
5,"Candid, brave, caring, & most importantly - relevant.","Brilliant. Well-written. Superbly addresses the point (why foreign aid isn't working in Africa). Calderisi obviously cares very much - enough to say what needs to be said.I read this book a year ago and still remember it vividly, which attests to how succinctly Calderisi conveys important information."
2,Review of Trouble with Africa,The evidence given is more anecdotal and 'desk reviewish' than based on solid research. The author indulges a bit too much in touching on his personal life business which a reader is unlikely to have bought the book to want to read about. Nevertheless there are many conclusions that are worthy and valid.
3,So you want to name a new species?,"A classic reference work of value to systematists wishing to coin names for new species, or for scientists more generally inquisative about the origin of terms for technical words used in their subject."
1,"Great movie, terrible quality DVD","I love this movie, but this is the worst quality DVD I have EVER seen. I am SO disappointed. Why is such a terrible version out there to purchase as a ""new"" DVD? It's so clearly a copy of a copy of a copy of the film."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have loved this movie for years but was disappointed in the horrible quality of this DVD. Unfortunately there is not a decent DVD of this movie on the market. The film quality is so bad that the movie is really painful to watch! I hope someone is able to correct this situation and produce a quality DVD of this movie. Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor and the rest of the cast give a loving and funny portrayal of bringing a baby into the world. I will miss not having it in my film library and will rely on catching it on TCM when I can."
3,Elizabeth Taylor,"I did love the original ""Father of the Bride"" which stars Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer Tracy, but this sequel was not as good. Elizabeth is so young in this movie, she is sooooo pretty, I wish it had been in color."
1,"MGM has not released this DVD, or any!","MGM in 1979 failed to renew the copyright on this movie, and all DVD releases of Father's Little Dividend are bad copies (including, but not limited to, Madacy, Delta, and Alpha).DO NOT BUY, THE QUALITY IS WORSE THAN VHS, THE VIDEO AND AUDIO ARE SERIOUSLY FLAWED.Please write to Warner Home Video (formerly known as MGM/UA) and ask them to release Father's Little Dividend to DVD."
1,That's 0 star by the way!,"I cannot find the words to say how i feel about this C.D... It's that bad. Lolly cannot sing at all just whine. You may think that big boys don't cry but i guarantee you they will when they hear this ugly C.D. The music is childish, stupid and the lyrics are horrendous. One of the songs goes like ""Oh mickey your so fine, you blow my mind..."" and some other rubbish. I recommend that you don't buy this C.D EVER! (You'll thank me later!) Save your money for buying an album by a talented singer like Joe or Avant. Much love to you if you can bear the first 3 seconds of Lolly's pathetic ""MY FIRST ALBUM""! I'm not that patient!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"In the pages of their new book, Ellen Schwartz and Suzanne Stoddard relate this quote from Paul Hawken's, The Ecology of Commerce: ""There is no polite way to say that business is destroying the world."" While Hawken was talking specifically about the physical Earth, Schwartz and Stoddard are not so limited in their condemnation. Business is destroying the world and everything in it: democracy, living wages, healthcare, the nutritional value of food and even our sanity. We'll put it simply: If you agree with that mindset, you'll love this book. If you have any doubts that corporations constitute an evil empire, you won't. Nevertheless, we [...] recommend that dedicated professionals read this double-barreled critique of the corporate world, just to know how the other side sees you."
2,Check the number of pages before you buy !!!,"This wonderful book contains in its original form more than a thousand clearly written pages, and over five hundred illustrations. The poor excuse of a book, facsimile copy I got for ~12$ contains less than three hundred pages, and in its black and white printed form (opposed the full color online view) is barely readable. Check the number of pages in the book version offered before you buy !Amazon should do a better job at separating this inadequate version from the original.Having paid only <12$, it would be more expensive to return the book than keep it, so I just ordered a different version. I hope this time it would be the appropriate one."
2,Very odd and often disturbing,"I was very excited when I received this one in the mail. Having been a long-time and old school Bjork and Sugarcubes fan, I couldn't wait to see Bjork's movie debut. Her performance was not in question, but the script and direction were my main problems with it. First of all, I would've preferred Icelandic with English subtitles. It was all in English. The mood was dark and odd, which really was enhanced by the film being in black and white. Far too much information was left up to the viewer to decide on. Most of the action was talked about in past tense in bad voiceovers while showing barren landscapes. The plot suffered due to the director trying to be too artsty. So constantly, I had to keep adding in scenes in my head that were never there. Ugh! The movie had a cold realism and a grim fairy tale type ending. It was not horrible, but my copy of this immeadiately was listed on ebay after I watched it."
3,Arcade Basketball,"I only played a couple of games with my friend. I'm an NBA Live fan myself, but I gave 2K a shot anyway. I've gotta say this game was really fun. The graphics weren't as good as Live, but the players movements were more realistic. However, the score at the end of the game was extremely high. The players moved really fast, giving the game more of an arcade feeling. For simulation style basketball, which is what I prefer, I go with NBA Live. But for flat out, run-and-gun basketball, 2K has what you need."
5,Good Small Group Study,"As a small group leader for mostly new believers, we found this book very beneficial in establishing some good Biblical foundations. Being a basic book, it works out to be very accessible to most of the group. Contents include where the Bible comes from, why it has been organized the way it is, and other basic tenants of scripture."
5,A Very Good Book,I managed to pass the CCNA exam on my second try with this book. The explanations and examples are clear and straight to the point. The chapters are also arranged in a very systematic way which makes study enjoyable. Trust Todd if you want to pass your CCNA.
4,Complete reference for the exam and to review,"I think is a complete reference to pass the Cisco's Exam and reviewing your concepts.You have virtual labs to configure different scenarios, and try many things. Nothing happen if you add a wrong line. And you can change easily everything.You will have the entire book in electronic format and many other sources to learn in your computer.But the exam version is not the last one. You can check in Cisco's site. However, the book is almoust complete."
2,I Love Kelly,"I know it doesn't seem like it since I gave her two stars, but I do. I think she should stick to ballads and R&B. The ""rock"" songs are O.K., but not very well written. She has a more soulful voice and it is not displayed much here. I think she is very talented but she needs better songwriters. She has a bluesy voice which is showcased on ""The Trouble With Love Is"" which I like a lot. Also, only the photo on the inside looks like her! My Mother says they airbrushed too much. We know she probably didn't have much say this time around, but I think she will only get better and better."
2,That could've been me!!,"Yeah, she's beautiful and has a good voice but you know what? So do I. I auditioned for American Idol that year and I'm pretty sure all three of the judges were on crack cocaine b/c they said I had absolutely no chance of becoming anything. Even Paula who tries to sugarcoat everything said I had pretty nice hair but that was all I had going for me. I'm sticking to my guns and saying I should have been the one who had that glorious moment! My heart burns with rage when I hear Kelly's voice on the radio! Someone gave this CD to me as a gift b/c they thought even though I was rejected from the auditions, I would love to have the winner's album. What an idiot. I tied it up in the branches of my tree in hopes that a crow will come and peck at it. Ha! Take that! Mark my words. I'm the next american idol!"
4,So Thankful!,"Clarkson was an excellent choice for the American Idol, although maybe not the best. Despite this, ""Thankful"" is a wonder Pop/slight RnB album that will leave the listener very satisfied. BUT, beware the screaming and obvious immature feel the album gives off; it is sometimes overpowering. I do think, however, that she has enormous potential as a growing singer/songwriter."
2,Zzzzzzzz,I loved Kelly in AI but this CD really doesn't showcase her great voice. There are maybe three songs on here that are decent. The rest are soooooo boring that I have to fast forward them. I would recommend borrowing this from a friend for a week before you decide to buy it.
3,Disappointed,"I haven't bought the CD yet, I've only listened to the sound clips. I have to say that from those few bars of music I'm a little disapppointed in the songs RCA picked for Kelly to sing. Not only that, what did they do to her look? She was the all-American girl next door and now (based on her performance 2 weesk ago on American Idol) they've turned her into a trendy ... like Britney and Christina. Couldn't the record label let Kelly look like herself and pick songs that didn't sound like everyone else's. Afterall, that's why she won everyone's hearts on American Idol. Maybe the next CD will be better. There's no doubt THIS GIRL CAN SING!!!! Rock on, Kelly!"
4,Kelly Clarson is the bomb.com,"Okay, I think we can all admit that we were not sure what to expect by an album that is drenched in Music industry heavies, and of course we can expect one of the most over-produced albums of the year. Despite all that Kelly Clarkson can sing. While in some ways I think this album is just a hint at what the future holds, there are some great songs in here. The best is ""Just Missed the Train,"" which has a different style then expected from this album. But come on, what could be more fun than a whole CD of Kelly Clarkson singing? Just get it, even if you have to hide it from your friends who think your musical tastes should be above this. It's just fun, and we all need that."
5,AWESOME,"This is the best CD to come out of a new artist in years. Kelly is the new Celine. If you are considering buying this album, I promise you it will be worth your money."
4,A great CD - I love driving to it!,What a voice - I am really enjoying this CD and downloaded some songs to my IPod to walk to - highly recommend it. I expected ballads - boy what a great surprise! Kathy
2,A Few Good Songs,"I felt that this album was just thrown together in a rush. I definitely expected more from Clarkson on this first album. There are a few good songs, but the CD is just not that exciting. I enjoyed Justin Guarini's CD much more."
2,"Thankful I didn't buy it,, just borrowed it.","Here is another shining example of how one can have a powerful voice with range, and make boring music. Think Christina Aguilera, who co-wrote the song ""Miss Independent"" and uses the same intonations to pull it off. Ms. Clarkson is another copycat oversinger with more screaming than soul.It is so obvious that the production was as contrived as a Britney Spears cd, but, Britney comes across with a sense of humor about the whole thing. Kelly Clarkson is just another one of the singers, the young fans can say ""oh she is the only one can sing"" meanwhile they learn only that singing is about vocal acrobatics and not emotions.Ms. Clarkson needs to get together with some competent songwriters which does not include master of hooks Dianne Warren or ""miss girlpower"" Christina Aguilera. A fresh approach to singing and songwriting and you might have half a chance.Maybe when a Joplinesque or Stevie Nicks influenced singer hits the scene then we can talk."
1,Be Thankful You Never Bought This...,"Simply put. IF you value your eardrums, you will stay away from this CD. It is literally and figuratively painful. Kelly screams her way through the songs, apparently trying to disguise that she can't hit the notes. Has there ever been a worse song written and performed than Miss Independent??"
1,OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a lousy collection of music. I was given this as a gift (obviously some kind of cruel joke!!) and gave it a fair chance but, YUCK!!!, this is truly terrible.What's with these American Idol people anyway?? Can they not come up with anything good??I think this girl should get into modelling, or something else, where we can just look at her and not listen!!!!!!I know most here are going to push that ""NO"" button below this review, but I don't care, sorry, but this is bad!!!"
1,Horrible,Sorry but winning a talent show on TV doesn't make you a star. This album is horrible. Kelly does not have a good voice. It's so weak. Her voice sounds so forced and strained. She already blew her voice out once. The songs on this album are so boring and bland. She should go back to whatever job she had before she went on American Idol. The only success she'll have will be from Idol hype. Once that dies down so will her career as a singer.
1,This CD stinks,"First of all let me start with saying that I never thought Kelly Clarkson was really a good singer or very talented.I was THANKFUL that I did not actually pay for this CD.It's garbage.Some of these songs are far worse than I could have even imagined.Beautiful Disaster isn't beautiful, it's just a disaster.This CD is filled with bad pop and a dash of attempted R&B; that Clarkson can't quite pull off.Clarkson cannot seem to fit into her singing role.She dresses hideous and looks horrible at every public appearance.Her chubby babyface doesn't allow her to look sexy.Note to Kelly Clarkson: No more skirts sweetie.You don't have the legs for it."
1,Maybe the worst CD of all time,"It is very sad indeed that this is what the world of music has come to. Take an overweight, pig faced waitress, stick her in clothes so tight that the Bun and Thigh master informercial becomes more profound, then have her screech her way through and album that is so overproduced that you wonder why she isn't being booked of a tour of Six Flags all over the country. She misses notes everywhere, the lyrics of the songs are downright pitiful, and the song structures themselves will not be making Led Zeppelin or Pink Floyd toss and turn at night. This music is all hype with no talent, and I feel very bad for the teenagers of today that couldn't grow up in the seventies like I did, when the top 40 music was Boston, Zeppelin, Floyd, Aerosmith and the likes. Stay far away from this piece of junk. I am already using mine as a coaster."
3,A FEW GOOD SONGS BUT I WON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson's first album only has a few songs which i like,but i didn't like this album i didn't think it showed her that much!!!!!! I think that her second cd really shows who she really is and this one is too poppy for me!!!!!! If you like pop music a lot then get this cd,but i wouldn't own it myself!!!!"
5,Kelly's CD was suprisingly refreshing!,"Though it seems like some of her songs were a bit rushed in the writing, I was pleasantly suprised at how well the cd turned out. She had several different styles of songs: country, r&b, even a little Celine-type ballad. The only song that I felt was lacking a little was the duet with Tamyra. I expected to be much more impressed. If her next cd is twice as good as her debut cd, it'll go gold in no time at all."
4,Wow! First review!,"Can't believe I'm first, and I also can't believe Amazon hasn't put up the track listing yet. Slow slow slow! Quick review here, I don't have much time here. My favorite songs on here are without a doubt ""Miss Independent"", a wonderful first single choice (originally written for Christina Aguilera's ""Stripped"" CD but never completed by her, a fact we have been beat over the head with mercilessly) and ""Low"", which has a funky Avril Lavigne-Michelle Branch vibe to it. This album sparkles with variety and Clarkson's range and clear voice shine, but sadly, there is too much cheesiness on the album to give it five stars. The biggest offender is her smash single ""A Moment Like This,"" which rivals Mariah Carey's ""Through the Rain"" in it's schmaltz. That is not enough to keep the album from being good, though. This one's a winner!"
5,I'm THANKFUL for THANKFUL!,"Kelly Clarkson's Debut Album THANKKFUL is a refreshing combination of Pop,R&B,Soulful Ballads and Rock.Kelly can sing Like no other and she puts her signature sound on each and every track!..Displaying the versatility and creativity (she wrote on the album) that made us fall in love with this talented Texan this is a must addition to anyones collection who is a true lover of music..Honestly this is the only CD I can put on and listen to from start to finish! Yes it is that good!"
5,Kelly Rocks!!!!!!!!,"Kelly Clarkson Rocks!!!!!!!!! she has the greatest voice ever!! This CD is beautiful, just beautiful, she really knows how to sing. I love this CD and I can Not wait for her next CD ""Breakaway"". Kelly is a good role model for kids to look up too. She is not Trashy like Avril Lavinge and Britteny Spears and ect.(I'm not saying they are bad people). The only bad thing I would say about this CD is that is she uses one swear word in the 7 song. all her songs are good!! Kelly Clarkson has a amazing and beautiful voice and is very pretty. If you get this CD you will love it, I hope my review helped you!!! enjoy!!!"
5,good,"this cd is really good it had alot of different varieties of music. my favorites from the cd are beautiful disaster, you thought wrong, thankful, and low. it has a lil bit of something for every1."
5,Better Than Ever,"I have always have been a huge fan of Kelly. This cd rox! You should definitly buy it! You wont be sorry. This is what i think of the songsThe Trouble With Love Is- 7/10 This song is pretty good. But its kinda hard to get used too.Miss Independent- 9/10 This song rox! The only thing is that you kinda get sick of it!Low- 6/10 Ok, I dont think it is a very good songSome Kind Of Miracle- 8/10 A nice slow songWhat's Up Lonely- 10/10 Great song! One of my favorites!Just Missed The Train- 9/10 Nice song! The should make a video for it!Beautiful Disaster- 9/10 Good! I dident like it at first but now i do.You Thought Wrong- 10/10 BEST SONG ON THE CD! It rox! Kelly sings with Tamyra GrayThankful- 10/10 Great song! It had a great beat!Anytime- 10/10 Great! You can really hear her great voice!"
3,great voice an o-k album,"kelly clarkson starts off great with miss independent,but the album gets a little boring, instead of buying this album buy madonnas new album american life!!"
5,A Kelly Fix,"Finally, I waited so long......like forever. It's a great debut album. Love Tamyra Grey song the best. I look forward to buying more Kelly albums."
4,Some really great songs on this CD.,"I was quite surprised in the power of her voice. There are some songs that I skip and do not want to listen to, but there are a good 5-6 songs that are top notch. 'Miss Independent' was a perfect first single for her, exciting song. Her next single, 'Low' is also very good, kind of different and may get her some new fans. I think her next single should be 'Anytime', it is a very powerful ballad, one of the best I have heard, it is the best song on the CD and one of best ballads ever. With the two bonus tracks(A Moment Like This & Before Your Love), and 4-5 really good new songs, this is a very worthwhile CD to purchase. Very enjoyable music."
4,Thankful For This Album,"Kelly Clarkson showed us last year on American Idol that she had the vocal ability to compete with the likes of powerhouse vocalists like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and Mariah Carey. Now, with this great debut album, that showcases her amazing voice, she finally has the chance to not only demonstrate the power of her voice, but her writing skills as well. Being lucky enough to work with writers like Babyface and Christina Aguilera, and producers like Clive Davis, Kelly stretches herself through all the strings of the guitar of music genres, having songs on this album that range from country to R&B. Some of the pipe bursting notes Kelly belts on this CD send chills down my spine everytime I hear them no matter how many times I hear them like ""Low"", ""Miss Independent"", ""You Thought Wrong"", and ""Anytime."" This is a great album for anyone who enjoys variety mixed with great talent and skill. Definite contender for Best New Artist at this year's Grammys."
1,Not Anything Here,Kelly has boring generic songs on Thankful composed by hired songwriters. This album is standard over produced pop. She may be able to juice the American public for a few more years but then it will be lights out for this act. Everything associated with American Idol is hot right now and Kelly will remain popular as long as the show is. Clarkson brings nothing new to the table and would find a better home at country fairs.
3,Big fan--but dissapointed,"I thankfully did not purchase this album but have heard all of her songs already and I am dissapointed. I thought she would do so much better on her first album. I am a big fan of Kelly and think it's great that she has her album out and that it has gone to #1 on the charts, but in my opinion, she should've been at #5 maybe. There are only 4 good songs on this cd, which inclue, Miss Independent, Just Missed The Train, Before Your Love and A Moment Like This. I was happy with just getting her single that first came out. I personally rate this album at a 3.5 at least and that's high in my book. Most of the songs on this CD are just boring and plain. Hopefully she'll do better on the next album, and I wish her all the luck on it. But personally, if you do not enjoy listening to so many slow songs, don't purchase this album. She's got a GREAT voice and I give her that, but the songs don't fit....I expected so much more from her..."
1,3 reasons NOT to buy this cd,"I am an AI fan who couldn't wait for this cd to come out. After listening to it I was seriously dissapointed and have been trying to give it away since for three reasons:1. It's much much much more R & B than pop2. There are NO SINGABLE LYRICS (which is boring and no fun)- nothing catchy!3. The musak behind the lyrics is, well, musak. Not interesting or dynamic at all.I like Kelly Clarkson, but as Simon might say- ""not your best performance"""
3,Not My Favorite,"I like Kelly's voice as she has a great range and richness however, there is more screaming than singing in the song. At the rate of her over production of her pipes, she will not last long as a singer as she will have destroyed her vocal cords. There were several in the album that I liked but was disappointed overall. I loved Kelly on AI but the album does not live up to her beautiful, rich voice."
2,Yuck.,"I got this cd not because I liked the songs ""A Moment Like This"" or ""Before Your Love"" (which bored me to death after 2 listenings), but because her song ""Miss Independent"" was fun and catchy. Ok, the rest of the album lies with and includes the 2 previously mentioned songs, and ""Miss Independent"" is the only semi-fast song on the disc. The rest are slow, draggy, screechy, and boring. If you liked ""Miss Independent"" DON'T buy this disc, for your own good. However, if you liked not that one, but ""A Moment Like This"" and ""Before.."", you'll probobly like the rest. Not recommended. I gave mine away after the first time I listened to it."
4,A real album from AI's first winner.,"If you're expecting one or two hits with filler from her debut, you'll be pleasantly surprized.Kelly delivers in all genres, including R&B;, pop-rock, ballads. Somehow, her voice and connection to the music make them more accessible to folks like me, who don't normally pay attention to a new release in those overcrowded, overdone categories.The only weak aspects are the lyrics and themes of many songs, which tend to focus on self, relationships, and a few cliches. For most pop singers her age, this would be expected. But Kelly's vocal maturity and style are way beyond her years, and she had plenty of help putting this together. I wish they had done more to make the songs classic.One notable exception is ""Beautiful Disaster"". I can see listening to it ten years from now, when Idol-mania has become a goofy memory.Songwriting: 7/10Musicianship: 9/10Sound Quality: 10/10Originality: 5/10Listenability: 9/10"
4,very good first album,"After lighting up America with spine tingling renditions of old classics during Idol, everyone eagerly anticipated the release of Kelly Clarkson's first Album. And she delivered the goods with a solid selection of songs combined with her trademark powerhouse vocals.My favourite songs on Thankful are ""Just missed the train"", ""Anytime"", ""The trouble with love is"" and ""Miss Independant"". The lyrics are uniformly excellant, although a little cheesy at times on songs such as ""before your love"" and ""A moment like this"". Kelly Clarkson's vocal ability is clearly on show here, and she regularly nails those top notes with incredible passion and feeling.This album is very good and highly recommended"
4,Good CD,"Over all I thought that this cd isn't that bad. Personally I think the best songs on this cd are The Trouble With Love, Miss Independent, Low, Just Missed the Train, You Thought Wrong, Anytime. On the cd it says that A Moment Like This and Before Your Love our new mixies but there the same songs with nothing new on Kelly's cd. If you like American Idol and Kelly Clarkson I think you should buy this!"
5,First,"I love this CD. A really good CD for a first album. I especially love Miss Independent, Low, Thankful, You Thought Wrong, Anytime, & A Moment Like This. All great songs though. Go out and buy it. You won't regret it."
5,"I didn't think it would happen, but I'm happy it did!!!","Well, isn't this fantastic. American Idol Winner Kelly Clarkson comes out with an album- one some say was destined to flop- and she has over 250,000 buys the first week... Pretty amazing, but really, was it worth it? Was all the hype true? I had to see for myself.I purchased the rather plain covered cd, and had a listen... I was shocked at the diversity of the songs and the true originality of the themes. Everything on this CD is worth a listen, and I must admit, unlike the Single-CD, I find myself humming these catchy tunes throughout my day.I didn't think it was going to happen, but I'm soooo very happy that it did.Favorite Song: Beautiful Disaster, ThankfulLeast Favorite Song: The trouble with love (still good)Total rating: 9.3/10.0"
1,I have not receive my first issue,I think the title says it all.I renew using Amazon... no magazine yet.
4,Motor Trend magazine,"Motor Trend is a very good car magazine. About 15-20 years ago, it was only ""fair"" in comparison to Car and Driver, and, Automobile. Now, it is a good, largely objective mag. As stated in prior reviews, there is some subjectivity; however, all car magazines I have read do have SOME objectivity -- we do want their opinions. They do test high-end autos (Porsche, Aston Martin, Ferrari, etc.); but, that probably comprises only 10% of their tests. If you really want to read about high-end cars, read Road and Track. Know that the 4 American car magazines prefer sporty driving and handling autos of all types. Generally, if the car is not reasonably quick and doesn't handle fast-paced or back-road (I do not mean off-road) driving well, it will lose points in a comparison."
4,"Good, Independent Film",I got on a J.P. Allen kick and rented all his films. This one's a good drama with decent production value. The acting's pretty good. It held my interest.
1,night time show,"If you have a hard time falling asleep, buy this DVD - you won't regret it. You'll be asleep before it ends. The only way to see how it ends is to fast forward to the last 10 minutes and you will still not know what the plot is about. Even if you manage to keep your eyes open throughout the entire DVD."
3,"fair, but not much color","I bought this through a catalogue because it advertised that it included color footage shot by George Stevens. It does, but only about 6 minutes worth. If you've seen his ""D-Day to Berlin"" you've already seen most of it. Some of the color film is shown small under the credits and then not again. I was disappointed."
5,Very informative book,"This is an excellent, comprehensive book about Huntington's Disease. It is written for doctors, scientists, and other professionals dealing with Huntington's Disease but can also be read by Huntington's Disease families who wish to gain a deeper understanding of the disease. Each chapter is written by experts. There is information about the history of Huntington's Disease, its neuropathology, the psychiatric and behavioral problems, research, genetics, epidemiology, and the treatment of symptoms.In addition the information about HD that has been published in medical and scientific journals, there is some valuable information from clinical practice that can't be found elsewhere.I purchased the book to help me answer questions posed by readers of my HD websites and I have found it to be very valuable."
4,It's great,It was used a ton when we first gifted it. But I think it's a pain for people to keep turning it on. I've seen it in little boutiques and stores. I think they seem to get the most mileage out of it.
1,snap,"Within 2 weeks of getting these headphones, my left band snapped when removing them from my head. I've treated them with kid gloves and still they broke! Dont know how this got through Sony QA but they should be ashamed of this design; after looking at these phones, unless you have a very large head where the bands are extended to full length, or extremely small head where theyre not expanded at all, you WILL BREAK THESE. Unless fully extended to distribute the little pressure, or fully closed, there is a weak point right at the top of the bands where the plastic goes from thin to thinner.The sound was okay for my needs.The comfort was pretty bad though as others have mentioned. They stay on well enough but are not at all natural feeling in and around the ears when in place.To think that these were produced with the active user in mind, with how poorly and delicately theyre engineered, keep searching for a better pair."
1,Ouch!,"These headphones may be convenient and deliver adequate sound, but I found them too uncomfortable to use. The in-ear portion is large with a sharp edge that hurt, unless I adjusted the headband until it was too loose to stay on. Foam covers would have made a big difference. Few other reviews mention discomfort, so maybe my ears are unique, but I recommend trying these on before you buy--you'll know quickly enough."
1,Strike 2,"Good sound but way to brittle at extension piece. I've had two in two months. Each broke at the slider entension. Each time I did not apply that much force to make it break. I've had sony sports headphones before but these are not worth buying if they break so easly. If you buy them and treat them with kit gloves then they will probably be worth the money, but who really baby's their headphones esp. if they are sports related. I'll try ear piece wraparounds next time."
2,"Better than what you get with the iPod, but will eventually break","These headphones are indeed a step up from the Apple ear buds if you take your iPod on a run. Initially, these headphones were just the ticket. They folded up nicely in my carry-on (I travel weekly), and were VERY secure on my runs.Then they broke. Then I kicked myself for not taking to heart the many other reviews indicating their fragility.As noted in other reviews, it would be much better to have a metal band running through the headset rather than it being made of separate plastic components. But that's what you get for the price."
1,complete junk,"I wish I listened to these reviews. I bought 2, since I am a gentle person with my stuff, and each of them snapped into pieces (as described below) in just a few days. This is a shoddy product."
1,BROKE AFTER 3 DAYS!!!,"this product is pure junk.I used it with my ipod,and it broke only after 3 days.I bought it because I sweat alot.On the 3rd day at the gym,the volume in both sides would not go above a certain point. too low for me to hear.I know it wasn't my ipod because when I bought a new pair of a different brand of headphones,the volume problem disapeared!I brought them back to Best Buy for my money back"
2,"Great sound, great look, breaks easily though","I really loved these headphones, right up until they broke 2 weeks later. I wasn't rough on them a bit, I was folding them back up after a workout, and snap they went. I would suggest the Nike SHJ045 Headband Headphones. Far better quality."
1,They always break,"These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around, but they always break. I mean, I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time. If these cost $15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year, compared to ones that cost $25 and they last two years, the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap, I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I'm being rough with them - I treat them well, but eventually they die (usually the sound goes out in the left ear).I am no longer going to get these, fool me... 4 times. Doh!"
2,"Good, but not sturdy in the long run.....","I really liked these when I first purchased them, and have gone through several cheap bud-type headphones in the past....average life span of the cheapies was 2-3 months. These lasted almost 5 months: Yesterday, the right speaker crapped out, and, while collapsing them to put them away, the center hinge snapped. It's a good design, but cheaply executed. So now, I'm stuck looking for another pair of sports headphones that can take it. I would also encourage the gushy, uber-positive reviewers to wait until they've owned a product awhile before posting their review."
1,"Good Sound, Poor Construction","1. I got these to replace my old / yellow Sony sports headphones (similar design).2. They sound fine, but as one of the other reviewers noted--> these headphones are very poorly constructed; I broke them within 2 weeks (the weak joint is the plastic part that moves in / out). I thought, ""ok, my fault, I'll be more careful""--> thus I bought another pair--> broke those as well, while just routinely opening them up etc...3. Since these are to be used by folks doing sports etc... I can't understand why Sony made such a poorly constructed headphone."
2,Poor quality,My second one just stopped working. Each one lasted for less than a year. I was a Sony fan but now I'll try other brands.
2,Too fragile,"I've tried this one a few times, since I liked a previous model. These are way too fragile and the plastic near the joint has broken within a week twice. Last year's model was more durable.The sound was good and they did keep a good sound after I had some very sweaty exercise.But I've needed to keep the headphones together with tape, so I'm looking for another style."
1,"Flimsy, broke in 2 days","hope you got a good price, because these will break quickly due to the cheap plastic and lack of quality."
2,"easily broken, sound quality ok","I would give the headphone 4 stars if sony knows how to make them more durable. the material used is very cheap and fragile, a little bit of force would brake it from the junction very easily. I guess this is how sony make money by force you to buy frequently. the sound quality is ok. but if you keep the headphone more than 20 mins in your ear, it will start to hurt your ear canal because of the pressure. After broke my two headphones in 3 months, it is enough for me. Try another model or brand if you want a quality built headphone."
1,junk headphones,"Broke when folding gently after one month of running with them.Very uncomfortable for ear, would never buy again.If this is supposed to be for sport use it's a joke."
1,Not worth the gas to go get them,"The sound was ""okay""...after all, they're Sony, so the sound's not going to be great to begin with. I purchased mine at Best Buy, not thru Amazon, just for the record. After only a week or so of use, the band snapped in two while putting them on; I had not stretched them apart any farther than I would any other set of headphones."
2,nice for exercise but BROKE,These were perfect for exercise (held on my head very well) until they broke in just under a year. I wasn't even putting any particular pressure on them. I will stay away from Sony in the future.
2,"Great Price, Works Well, Cheaply Made","I've been searching for a decent pair of headphones to use while running and settled on these as they were the only ones available at the various stores in my neighborhood. They work just fine, but are very flimsy and because of that are prone to snapping in half (which mine did within 2 weeks). I'm now searching the web to find a better pair, but would recommend you stay away from these as the plastic parts are just to weak and prone to breaking."
2,Flimsy,"They function well, but they break easily. I have gone through two of them now. I have learned my lesson now and will go for another brand next."
1,the perfect headphones for the runner who hates intact headphones,"Seriously -- these are total junk. The plastic near the joint snapped right away, just from putting them on. I've had sturdier balsa wood airplanes.The sound is okay for the price, but what's the point if they break right away?"
2,Poor Manufacturing Quality,"I have owned these headphones many a times, and up until 5 months ago I wouldn't have bought another pair out there for sport purposes. They have always provided what I needed in a sport headphone, but like I said, until 5 months ago. Recently, the last 2 pairs I've bought, have broken in similar fashion while NOT IN USE. I used each pair while running and lifting, nothing too crazy, but they broke extremely easily around the first joint coming up from the ear bud. I was just moving them about my room or on/off my head and they snapped. Nothing extreme. I was very disappointed. I had recommended them to my girlfriend and hers broke, but in the top middle portion. Honestly I think Sony has changed something in their manufacturing process to produce such poor quality. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,Brought 2 at the same time.,I brought 2 of these at the same time to save on shipping...both broke at the same place (top of the head band) within a month. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!
2,break after 1 year use,"After I brought this for 1 year, one of the earphone was not working. Then I brought another one. Same thing happened to me again: after 1 year, it broke again. It feels good to wear, but quality control is bad."
5,Great To Run in,"These headphones are great to run in, and a little difficult to lift in, but they still work better than any sport headphone i've ever tried,Con is you can never wear a hat when wearing these working out, they slide right out of your ear"
2,Fra - Gee - Lay,"The headphones gave good bass when angled just right in my ears, but that is pretty much where the positives end. The sweat guard failed several times while I was running and actually channeled sweat into my ears more than any other headphones I have ever used. The fold-up feature helped save space in my day pack but caused the cord to tangle. Finally, after only three months of use, the headphones snapped in half just last night as I removed them from my pack. This was a fun experiment with a new style of headphones but I will not buy another pair and would not recommend them."
2,Great sound and fit but Very fragile,"This item has a great sound and fits well on the head and in the ears; it fits very firmly and doesn't move around when working out, and I work out hard. In use, it is fantastic it. BUT::::::The downside, and it's a big one, is that it is super fragile. Simply folding it, I was always afraid of breaking it but there is no real way to store it, especially in a gym bag without significantly, increasing the risk of breaking it, unless you have a hard case that it will fit in for protection. I was only able to enjoy these for a week before I found them snapped in my bag. And I am usually very careful with stuff like this but... Way too fragile for a workout headphone and that is a big shame because they are one of the best I've ever tried."
4,acrylic silverware caddy,"good quality, nicely packaged, the only thing that could make it better is a handle that swings down to one side and doesn't remain fixed"
4,It works well on Vivitar 285hV triggered by 580EXII on 5d mark 2,"I have done lots of research trying to make the scenario work. Just got the peanut today and attached to Vivitar. It magically works! Fired 10 plus shot so far, haven't missed one. Will see how reliable this thing is."
4,Great Book,"The contents of this book has opened my eyes to a wealth of knowledge that one does not get in school and,has made me hunger for more knowledge of my race.Thanks to Rev. Marvin Stoddart for insight."
2,Not up to Robert's usual,"I have read all of the Jackovich series, but this one is a stinker and it isn't up to Robert's usual standards. Descriptions of streets and places in Cleveland were just too much, even for a former Clevelander like myself. The book was also very preachy burdened with trivial descriptions of eating habits and dissertations that detracted from the story."
2,Trunk Tray,"The idea is really nice, but I wish the walls are longer and thicker. When I received it, once side was down and after months it's still down. I couldn't get the mold to go back in shape or to get the wall to stay up."
1,falling down,"11 people before me have written reviews. Just how much do these qualify the ratings which they have given to it?In a telephone survey on CNN, 68% of people felt ""A"", whilst 32% of the people felt ""B"".These are percentages of the people who watched CNN and felt they had a valid opinion which they would democratically express by taking part in a telephone interview.Well done folks. Well done.Now we know what America is thinking.Well done Peter."
4,"good, but needed to cut it to make it comfortable",good material and cover. needed to cut of most of the part behind the neck to make it comfortable.
1,Don't waste your money,"I wasted 5 hours of my time today on endless help-line holds, downloading patches and drivers from Philips, and working fruitlessly with their support staff who could not bring this not-ready-for-primetime device to life. It gets returned tomorrow. Don't waste your time."
2,Not the strongest tool ever made,"I snapped the heads off of two M10 bolts. So I sprayed a liberal amount of PB Blaster, ran down to the local parts store, and bought the OEM 25467.The cobalt drill bits did great! They eagerly chewed into the broken bolt. Then I inserted the bolt extractor, got out my t-handle and gave it some muscle. SNAP! oops. The bolt extractor is now firmly lodged into the bolt.No problem, I thought. I'll just re-drill the hole and exchange the broken extractor. No luck. The drill bit just wont go into the broken extractor. I apply some more pressure to try to get it to bite and SNAP! oops, the drill bit just broke.Maybe it will remove deck screws, but I'm not wasting my time finding out. Let's see if they at least live up to their limited lifetime warranty."
2,I really tried to like this book...,"But I couldn't get past 40 pages before giving up. I know, it's a children's book, and Tolkien was busy with The Silmarillion (this book was finished in 1925, The Silimarillion started at 1919 and ended at 1973.), but the story's WAY TOO FAST! I couldn't finish this book without saying ""Why? Why? Why did I read it?""I'm giving it 2 stars because this is just Tolkien and it was just a children's story, way before his genius came into being in 1935 with The Hobbit."
1,No use at all,Does not seal good. so pollens and dust gets in from the edge of it.And it is too ridiculs to wear outside.
3,If only he could write,"This is the first Clive Cussler book I've read and from the very first page I was hooked. This book has a wonderfully eerie and ingenious introduction. But the more I read, the more irritated at his writing style, or lack of it, I became. I can't recall reading more wooden dialogue in my life. It is painful. His sentence structure and phrasing would have been red penciled by my sophomore English teacher. I found myself wanting to rewrite almost every paragraph, and groaning out loud, but I couldn't put it down. If only he could combine his clever ideas, action, impressive technical knowledge and eye for detail with a writing style that was not cringe-inducing, I would read another."
3,Not his best.,"Let's start by saying that the plot and action are top notch Cussler. But...the author seems to have taken it for granted that most readers aren't first time readers to his books. As such he left out considerable character development. All the action in the world gets stale fast if the entire cast of characters are two demensional. By merely providing simple observations into who the characters really are makes all the difference. You see this at the end when the writing becomes much more enjoyable to follow (love involvment, change of relationships, etc.)"
1,predictable male macho drivel,"Boooring! The hero is of course taller, stronger, and smarter than anyone, and all of the women are sexy, sensuous and in love with him at a single look. Moreover, it was a re-hash of the old Nazis-rising-again theme, with a generous dose of German-bashing. Tries for a Crichton archaelogical depth, but never achieves credibility."
2,Atlantis Found,"The book might have been alright, but the narrator of the unabridged audio tape left a great deal to be desired. It sounded like he was reading to an audience without a microphone and was trying to be heard by the person sitting in the last row. There was no feeling in his voice. I listen to all of my books by audio tape on my commute. I had to quit listening to this one because it was so awful. A weak story and a very bad narrator. I will make sure that if the narrator Michaiel Prichard I will NOT BUY the audio tape."
4,Atlantis Found,"I never grow weary of Dirk Pitt, or the cameos by Clive. It was my most anticipated Christmas present. Yes, I also caught the one typo (craved) but worse yet was the blatant contridictions on page 55 and 95. Having just become a certified diver this really stood out to me, unless there is something I am not understanding about dive suits. But no matter! Pure escape and entertainment which is why I read. However, I always thought Tom Selleck would have made a perfect Dirk Pitt and too bad none have been made into movies. However, James does corner the market on the silver screen and Clive Cussler would no doubt face considerable criticism trying to put Dirk on the big screen."
3,Still Good but a little Old,"I have read all of the Clive Cussler novels and unfortunately Atlantis Found brings nothing new to the series. The story starts very well but soon it falls into the well known formula of Dirk and Al beating all odds and most annoyingly, Dirk fighting off the blackness that is closing in on his vision. Still I am found enough of this series to enjoy the read but I wasn't fascinated by it. If you haven't read Cussler, get Raise the Titanic or Sahara before reading this one. Sahara being the best of the series largely because Cussler did not continue the same story line from chapter to chapter. Most chapters ended with a cliff hanger that wasn't answered right away, creating anxious and fast reading. Why Mr. Cussler abandoned this style escapes me."
4,"Summer Time, And Cussler Strikes Again","I'll admit it: Clive Cussler is my favorite guilty pleasure. Dirk Pitt is definately the Bond of the new century: cool, sophisticated but also caring and sensitive. This latest went with me on a skin diving trip and it it did not disappoint: cool breezes, sandy beaches, cold beer and Clive Cussler."
3,Clive Cussler has another hit...but not his best!,"Having read all his books, this one falls a bit short, but is none the less a fun read. If you have the time to get through 540 pages this holiday...it won't be time wasted."
3,Atlantis Found,"I really wanted this to be good. But.........I could not get into Dirk Pitt. He is always at the right place at the right time, I became very annoyed with his one-liners. What started out as what looked like a very good story turned into a very unbelievable tale of idiocy. The ending reminded me of an old A-Team episode where everyone turns to Hannibal with a suprised look, he leans back in his chair with cigar crooked in his mouth and grins. Everyone begins to laugh, the screen freezes and the credits role.Sorry, this will be my first and last Clive Cussler book."
4,Enjoyable reading in typical Dirk Pitt fashion!,"Any Pitt fans, this is a must-read, if not just the final chapter. Dirk's character mellows a bit in this novel, doesn't have his usual ""edge"". Great family reading, I don't mind passing these on to my 60 y.o. Dad and 25 y.o. little brother!"
3,Not Cussler at his best,"In general I like Cussler's books. They're exciting, entertaining, and easy to read. However, this one didn't impress me much. About half way through I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and getting annoyed with the character and narration. I'm not a huge fan of Cussler's writing style in general but the plots of his books usually keep me going. Atlantis Found just got confusing, over involved and over detailed in addition to the typical unrealistic nature of the Dirk Pitt novels. If you want to read Cussler's books I would go with Sahara, Raise the Titanic, or Trojan Odyssey which I consider to be much better."
2,TOM SWIFT FOR UNEDUCATED ADULTS,"Just change Dirk Pitt's name to Tom Swift and Al Giordano's to Bud Barclay and any uneducated adults who ran out of Tom Swift books will find something here to amuse themselves. That is exactly how this book reads. Very predictable, full of logic holes, and a flying car to boot. LMAO."
3,almost,"What I liked: 1. Cussler, as usual puts together a fast-paced adventure novel (action, some suspense) 2. I wouldn't mind one of my kids finding it(no ""f"" words, no gratuitous tacky sex scenes) 3. It's a totally unbelievable plot, yes--but picture any James Bond film since Dr. No and compare.Didn't like: 1. The villian characters were really predictable and acted like they came off of Scooby Doo (""It was a perfect crime and it would have worked if it wasn't for those meddling NUMA guys""!) The same villian characters didn't act like real people--they talked too much and revealed way too much of their evil plotting to Pitt instead of being protective. 2. Pitt and his friend Al should face the consequences of their bad negotiating tactics.In spite of its faults, it is an enjoyable read that doesn't take all of your attention."
4,could use working on,it was wonderful though it could have been better. it had great details etc. but the only problem was that there were too many boring parts with detail to the point it was almost similar to clancy
3,James Bond meets Indiana Jones,"I haven't read a Cussler novel in quite some time so when I saw this one at the store I picked it up and thumbed through it before purchasing it. I must tell you, the beginning of the novel is very interesting. Cussler sets up the schemes and characters pretty well and has some interesting twists on earth's history (although the dates don't match up according to current archaelogical research...but hey, this is fiction). That being said, it is pretty much hype after the third chapter. A lot of James Bond style action with Indiana Jones research and back-drops. All in all I would say that the book is fun to read but not much substance."
4,Another Fantastic Story by Mr. Cussler!,"Once again Clive Cussler has created another thrilling story that is realistic and to boot he has given me a wonderful tour down history lane. The plot moved along briskly and soon I found myself reading page after page. I thought there was less suspense in this story especially when I think of ""Sahara"" which I thought was just a terrific book. In summary, I would gladly recommend this book to all my friends. For me, Mr. Cussler is the type of writer that with all his novels, he has never disappointed me."
2,"Bad book, but would make excellent movie","Uggg.I'll keep this short - Cussler writes as if his primary goal is not to write a book so much as it's to write a movie script. Cussler has great ideas, does a bit of research to add a bit of ""meat"" to his plot, but almost all of his books need even more research, an editor's touch, and much less testosterone to make anything plausible.Cussler's books are fine if that's what you like, and it's OK if that's what you're looking for - just be warned that this and most of his books are just an excuse for another screenplay."
2,Not as good as previous efforts - IMHO,"I've been a Clive Cussler fan for as long as he has been writing. I have each of his books in both hardback and paperback and reread each of them at least once per year.The latest book was a bit of a disappointment. It starts out well but then fades. It's almost as if Clive didn't write it. I was anxiously awaiting this book and read it in two sittings. However, it's not going to be a favorite of mine. It may get reread on occasion.There's not enough of Dirk and Al working together for me. They're often separate which means their witty reparte is missing. All of the main characters are in it, but it seems to not fire on all cylinders. The last two Dirk novels have not entertained me nearly as much as his earlier works. It's hard to put my finger on it but it's just not as riveting as others. A lack of the sense of urgency and danger is part of it.Better luck next time Mr. Cussler. I'll continue to read your books as long as you continue to write them."
2,Dear Dirk,"Dirk Pitt you are very annoying. I love James Bond, and i love Indiana Jones even more. But Dirk Pitt, you are neither. Your toys, interests and looks are overly cliched. I'm afraid you just bother me. This novel offered an interesting insight to this lost city, but it is hard to figure out what is fact and what is fiction. The story is quite outlandish. One thing i did appreciate about this novel was the answer to ""why good guys' bullets hit, and bad guys' miss?"" The answer...good guys aim."
2,Good Start -- Weak Ending,"This book got off on a strong beginning, lots of details in the middle, and then a weak and disappointing ending."
4,Time to reflect,"This was the best of Cussler's later books in the series. Pitt and Al are long time friends and this book showed yet another dimension to their history. I will miss them. My mom, 2 sons and I all enjoyed this adventure and read through it too fast. A second reading brought about a time to reflect back on a truly terrific team that has brought us many adventures and given my family lots of lively discussions! Good reading for any adventure or history buff!"
1,Not as pictured,"The bridge pictured, with wide wings, is almost identical to one I've had for 40 years. Insteadd of this one, I received a Belgian bridge. Assured that they would send me the bridge as pictured, I returned the Belgian and was sent a French bridge with no brand name, very different from what is pictured. This vendor sends whatever they have handy. A bridge is a bridge is a bridge to them."
1,The disappointed soldier in Iraq,Im very disappointed with this company service. I have yet to recieve my product. I ordered it about 3 weeks ago and counting.
2,"More Season 8, than 9","Gave 2 stars just because it is Family Guy & Uncensored. Now that I read other reviews, I guess I'm late to complain, buying ""Volume 9"" expecting Season 9 and getting a mixture of ""8"" & ""9"", seems now the standard of the studios squeezing ever so tighter. You can't get a refund after it's opened and I already own Season 8, but I least got 2 episodes from Season 9.In any case, this is what you get: There are only 14 Episodes - 12 from 'Season 8' & 2 from 'Season 9'. Regarding another reviewer, it would be nice, to at least get a half season from the target season. With lower ratings (who can stand watching broadcast anymore, with 20 min of commercials) in the marketplace, including shorter seasons (split in half or thirds over a year); and now paying the same or more for less, I'd think twice about buying anymore of these DVDs. There are other routes to go."
5,money well spent,Arrived 4 days early! Works great. Dvds are not scratched and game in plastic wrap. Money well spent! Will make future purchases from this dealer.
3,I kinda feel cheated......,"I've been a fan since January 31, 1999.. Bought every DVD including the random DVD's they release so Seth MacFarlane could make some extra cash (like he needs it). But now I'm starting to get a little upset with these half season DVD releases.. I really feel scammed. I almost feel like not buying anymore. Between netflix, hulu, and amazon prime I'm starting to realize that people like Seth MacFarlane cant hold my arm behind my back in order to have their shows on demand.. Let alone the fact that family guy has kinda gone downhill the past 3 years... Maybe a handful (2-3) are memorable. Lets take a stand and maybe they will go back to trying to make us happy instead of filling their pockets :)"
5,A refreshing approach to teaching history!,"I was introduced to Joy Hakim's series as an undergrad and have yet to find a more stimulating resource for teaching history to children. As a child, I (like many, I suspect) dreaded the dry, bare-bones, sketches of American history. Boy, do I wish I had had this book years ago! It brings vibrant life to the wonders of our country's past. This particular volume blooms with exciting stories such as those little-known facts of real life sports heros of the day - including an introduction to Babe Didrickson, a female dynamo that history has virtually ignored ... until now! Art, music, presidents, controversy, WWII, they're all here in juicy detail!"
1,Curve for Men Cologne,"This cologne smells cheap! I decided to buy it after reading comments, but honestly it's bad! I usually use BVLGARI or HUGO BOSS and this one cought me with its price, but i guess that exactly why it's so awful. Avoid it!"
5,The Best Cd You'll Ever Get In This Whole World,"If there's one thing that makes me unable to live without, then I'll tell you now, THIS CD is the one...... the beautiful melody and the lyrics and best of all, the angelic voice of Angel Lopez just keep me wild all day and night......If only every cd has a quality as good as this cd, then RIAA can call it a day to stop piracy........coz nobody will support piracy when Angel(lead singer of SON BY FOUR) is there to sing for us......Really, get this cd, you won't regret it.......Buy this record, close your eyes, enjoy, and let Angel's voice take you to heaven....."
5,Good One!,"Quite happy with this buy. I wanted something without spices. The material is stated acrylic, but, it is actually glass. Otherwise it works well in my kitchen."
4,One of the best F1 sims,"I wish I could give a four-and-a-half star rating to this because the only problem I have is in figuring out how the replay mode works. I have only seen replays at the end of races and the graphics quality is not nearly as good as the in car view. The owners manual doesn't help much in this area. Everything else in this sim, except the A1 drivers, is superb. There are enough car tuning parameters to make even a GPL fan happy. The tracks look exactly like they do in the real life on-board camera shots(except for the sun-glare). The lack of adverse weather didn't hurt GPL, and it doesn't really hurt F1 2000. It does require a lot of hardware to run this sim. I've got 160m RAM and a Voodoo3 card and it works just fine. I've got Eidos' ""Official"" F1 sim and this annihilates it in every area, especially in graphics lighting and car tuning."
4,"come on geeks, its not that bad","I guess I'm not a hard core SIM nerd like most of these other reviewers, but I think this game is pretty fun. The track realism looks pretty damn good to me. I have a P3 700, with a pretty basic 3d card and only 64 RAM and this game runs fine. Look, I doubt this game was written for experts, and its probably targeted for the mainstream audience and general F1 fans like me. So if you're looking for the absolute best SIM, spend more... and get something else, otherwise this game is cheap and fun."
1,A very big dissapointment !,"After playing a demo of F1 World of garnd prix by EIDOS (recomended), I made the mistake and bought this EA Sporst F1 2000 game , I found out that altough EA sports made a lot of work with the exact cars drivers and circuits but the game is very unrealistic ! the sound is horrible ! also the forcefeedback is very low , and driving with my Logitech formula steering wheel was annoying , (This steering wheel is excellent with some other games). Anyway if your a F1 fan find out another game !"
2,Good for a few times of use,"Very Cheaply built product, I actually bought two and now I don't have neither of them because they brook after a few times of use and were thrown away."
2,Not that impressive,"I guess this is a case of getting what you pay for. Since I started dieting, I've wanted to track my measurements and body fat, so I got the fat calipers and measuring tape.The fat calipers don't seem particularly accurate. Measurements taken minutes apart are very different, and, if you don't have a lot of fat in an area, it's almost impossible to pinch up an accurate measurement.As far as the tape measure goes, save some money and just get one from a variety store. It's very awkward to try and position and close, and, by the time you're done, you'd have been able to do the same thing better and cheaper with an ordinary tape from any sewing basket.If you really want to track this stuff, kick in the bucks to get something good, or use household measurements."
3,"Works, but not consistently","I am not experienced at using body fat calipers, so I am having trouble getting consistent results. I got 17% and 21% in two different measurements back to back."
2,Only thing usable was the tape,"The measuring tape was great. The caliper itself is not user friendly, you need a second person to help out, and each time I pinch my skin I get a different reading, better off using one of the electrical scales, might not be accurate but better than this torture."
1,USELESS PRODUCT!!! NEVER BUY!!!!!,wow!!! I should get my money back!The same companies non digital caliper is amazing and this is just as useless!the numbers are never consistent and never accuarate! dont even dare to buy!!!but the tape is very good. Easy to use and you can measure areas like biceps etc without the help of anyone...
5,Good book,This is the best textbook I have ever read and the only way I could understand what my teacher is talking about.
4,I've had it for about 20 minutes...,"Pros = Good Quality, Kodak looked better, but really not much. Good Price. USB didn't work off a hub, but fine off a main port on the pc. Interface is good, but not great.Cons = Video with no audio. Looks like speakers but no noise. Others have audio since they support mp3s too.Overall quality 4 stars, 5 would be slightly better resolution and audio with videos.For stills only, 5 stars..."
2,"great frame, might not last long though","I have bought 3 of these. It's a great frame but one of the LCD's died after about a year (warranty is 6 months). If that's par for the course, it would get very expensive to have to replace this frame every year!"
2,Poorly Written JPEG Library,"My picture frame started acting strange. The screen would get all pixelated with bars and other graphical artifacts. Power cycling the unit would help things out temporarily but the problems just recurred.An email from Westinghouse technical support told me that I could only put ""raw JPEGs"" onto the frame because meta tags added by certain software can't be handled by their JPEG library. Most digital cameras automatically add tags. The suggestion was to open each picture in MS Paint and resave to get rid of any tags. Poorly written software."
4,Very Nice Frame!!!!,Westinghouse 8-Inch LCD Digital Photo FrameI have owned this frame since Last year and enjoy it very much!!! I use the mosiac feature and love the 4 pictures it displays every couple of seconds!!! The only problem I had was it hung up when I added 50 new pictures. I checked and found one of the new pictures I added was in BMP format.It seems to work best with pictures in JPG format!! I deleted that 1 BMP picture and it is working great once again without hanging up!!!! Very nice for the price so I bought another one for my son!!!!!
4,no more stinky puppy,"I love the way my Yokie-poo smells after her weekly bath.I won't say she is thrilled with being sprayed, so I've tried spraying it on my hands and working it in and it works just fine that way."
4,Very effective,"As others have mentioned before, this spray works great as a freshener but only so-so as a leave-in conditioning or grooming agent. I like the green apple scent--reminiscent of a Jolly Rancher candy and less cloying than many commonly found sprays at the store--and found it has a staying power of between 1 and 3 days, depending on how much time my Shiba pup has spent playing outside."
1,Stopped working after 10 minutes,"I have no idea what happened with this thing. It worked for 10 minutes, then after I saved a setting it stopped working altogether. Even a factory reset (on the back) wouldn't bring this thing back from the dead. Waste of time and money."
3,Don't try to use with XBOX 360,"I purchased this product simply because I was irritated that Microsoft charges you for everything extra you need for your XBOX. Unfortunately, this didn't work too good for a solution. The connection that was maintained was very slow. I have not tried it on other devices so this only pertains to the XBOX 360."
4,Start of the Chain Reaction...,"Cuban Link has been the underdog for years now. Surviving being black balled and prevailing with his release shows how much of a warrior and how much hunger he has. Cuban Link is a talented artist. This album show his versatility. Whether rapping in a fast flow, smooth flow, harder flow, or even in spanish, he comes correct. Cuban is one of the nicest out there with the complete package: lyrics, style, charisma, hunger, versatility, etc. He deserves to be one of hip-hops premier artist. He deserves his shine. I can listen to the whole album and not feel disappointed. A couple of beats could have been better but this album is a very solid album. He definitely out shines Fat Joe and most rappers out now. Let this be the start of a Chain Reaction!"
3,Cuban brings the crown back to the boogie down,This album is worth the money because its a flashback into the good old days when Pun was still alive. Cuban has really had a tough career but its good to see that he persevered. I bought the album because Im from the South Bronx and Im a huge supporter of Pun so listening to Chain Reaction is somewhat nostalgic. In this album there is something for everyone from the r&b cats to the reggaetton heads. Production could've been a lot better but other than that his lyrics are on point. Also the CD has more protection than Fort Knox I still dont know how Im gonna be able to add the album to my iPod.
4,CUBA!!!!!!!!!,Finally after years of mixtapes Cuban Link Resurfaces with chain reaction. Although im glad to see cuban link doing his thing and sh*ttin on fat f*ck joe im dissappointed in some of the production on the albulm but besides that cuban link still has his lyricism and the tracks is still hot.
3,Legal Thriller,"The author, a law professor and former assistant DA writes a well-plotted mystery. (She's also the daughter of crime writer James Lee Burke). Her main character in this series is Samantha Kincaid, an assistant DA working in Portland's Drug and Vice Division. Intense and brimming with authenticity, this book is recommended both for those who enjoy legal thrillers and for mystery fans--it will keep you guessing!"
5,Outstanding Writer,"Alafair Burke is an outstanding writer. Her experience as a former prosecutor and current criminal law professor is evident in the pages of Judgment Calls. One can learn a great deal about criminal law and procedure while enjoying a fast-paced (can't put the book down) mystery at the same time. The protagonist, Samantha Kincaid, is a smart, sassy deputy district attorney with a heart who won't let the bullies walk all over her. I thoroughly enjoyed Judgment Calls, and look forward to reading more of Burke's novels."
1,Terminally putrid,"Ms. Burke should apologize to the souls of the trees that gave their lives for this pap. If 10% of what James Lee Burke has had rubbed off on this kid, it might have been salvagable. This book is marred by (among other things): stock characters lifted from a rejected script Steven Bochco used to line his cat box; a hackneyed, overworked plot; dialogue like no people ever spoke; and truly cringeworthy prose. It beats my previous low-water-mark for a novel by a non-writer, which was Chuck Scarborough's ""Aftershock"".I guess Ms. Burke figured with the (likely) interesting cases she's seen and Dad's brain to tap, she could become the latest, greatest lawyer-novelist. I think this is just the sort of bravado Frank Sinatra, Jr., felt."
5,Makes learning scripture easier and faster,"This CD arrived in great condition. This is one of several CDs I own by Genie and Troy Nilsson. Every one of them is really good. Kids love the songs as well as adults. I use a LOT of Christian music, so I screen several Christian CDs regularly. I liked the gentler songs that left no doubt as to what the words were; but the kids like really fast songs too. Especially good were Ask, I Know the Plans I have for You, Wings of Eagles and Do. For several years, I've been responsible for picking a memory verse each month for our congregation. We usually minister through a skit or song that mirrors the message of the memory verse before the congregation repeats the verse. These songs are perfect for these presentations."
3,A little too weird for my tastes,"This book is definitely interesting. Unfortunately Lindsay seems to be trying to go overboard with the weirdness, and that diminishes the effect of the text somewhat. It is well written, and the pacing when necessary is brisk. The overall strangeness of the world so overpowers everything though it makes the story less spectacular than could be the case. The final chapter too doesn't really seem to mesh with the rest of the book. After hearing a lot of good things about this book, I really wanted to rate it higher, but Lindsay failed in my eyes to fully draw me into his world. It's good for a unique look at the planetary romance genre, however, for fans of that kind of thing looking for a bit of originality normally lacking."
2,Shrinkage,"I have worn FTL shirts for many years.This batch was disappointing because they shrunk a lot after a couple of washes. We don't use hot water to wash cloths so that isn't the reason and I have been losing weight, not gaining of late. So it has to be the shirts themselves.I am hoping I just got a bad batch of shirts and FTL isn't using poorer weaving techniques.But I would advise you to maybe order your shirts one size larger than normal. If they don't shrink like these did you can always wash them in hotter water so they shrink down to your regular size but if they do shrink without being washed in hot water, they should still feel like they are the right size."
5,Just Fine,"Hubby has been needing these for a while, but local supplies of correct size are not always available. So, here they were on Amazon! Just the same as previously purchased ones: fit fine, wash well, and last a fairly long time.Am delighted to have found them without having to go chasing around in the heat!"
2,Wait for the movie,This book was so boring it's crazy. I bought it thanks to a review I read in the Economist magazine and boy was I wrong!This is one of those books that come out so much better in the movie.
2,Can't hold interest,The exotic setting and customs are not enough to sustain the readers' interest for the duration of this prelude to WWII.
1,what a shame,"This book might have been good, I stopped after several chapters because of the banal, needless profanity. It's as if the author just discovered the f word and wants everyone to know it. But this seems common anymore, otherwise entertaining stories ruined by pointless, filthy dialogue."
3,a little bit of unlikely hindsight,"Poor Harry is neither a fish or a chicken, but halfway between. And the world of December 6 1941 is deeply in need of a strong swimmer. Really a very well written and researched novel by the master that would have gotten him lynched as late as 1950 for the politics. Harry is the social chameleon ( shape shifter) and gambler whose bet ( debts) all come due at once.An unexpected clairvoyance in the main Japanese characters leads to an unlikely surprise ending.More of an entertaining historical fantasy than anything that could actually have taken place.Man In A High Castle"
5,TC-DC58C TELE CONVERTER LENS,"This tele converter lens is very good for the Canon power shot G9, and it is a good price sold from Amazon,the filters are good too,the pictures that I took with the filter look nice , Thank you Amazon !"
1,Not what I was looking for,"When I ordered this workbook I was expecting a how to guide on HyperStudio. However, what I got was a supplement to a textbook called, ""Using HyperStudio- A Complete Tutorial for Windows and Macintosh"". Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed because I don't own that book. So, I'm going to end up sending the workbook back and ordering something more suited to my needs."
4,Beautiful at a GREAT Price,The rings arrived early and were in great shape. They are beautiful and it was easy for my fiance too!
4,A great book that relates well to teenagers.,"I think the McNeals accomplished what they set out to do in writing this book. ""Crooked"" is an awesome piece of realistic fiction that brings to life many of the struggles teenagers in today's world go through. Whether it's having confrontations with bullies at school, losing loved ones, having friends decide that they are to ""cool"" for you, or having problems at home, this book touches it all. After closing the back cover of this book you feel like you've gained life experiance. For anyone looking for a book with that really plunges you into the plot and characters, this is the book for you."
4,Slow Crookedness,A great book but very slow paced. I really liked the changing of characters for each chapter. AWESOME!!!!!
4,Great read,My daughter gave me this book to read and I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys YA books.
1,"Great cartoons, but no usable info","I was severely disappointed with book. It has entertaining cartoons, with virtually no usable information for individuals wishing to take the subject seriously, or even just wishing to get good basic info on canine massage."
5,Fantastic,The fairy tale retold. This time the girl ultimately realizes that she needs the prince like a hole in the head. Nice music too.
2,George Orwell accounts of Spanish War are better.,Matthews attacks Orwell's view of the conflict withinthe Loyalist side. He says Orwell changed his views later. But it was a change in emphasis. Matthew's says the Spanish war left Orwell with greater faith in human nature. True! But this does not deal with issues raised in Homage to Catalonia.
5,Wickedly Entertaining.....A must READ...,My girlfriend and I bought this book as referral from our frineds. I read it first and then set my wife up to read it while I was pretending to be asleep in the bed with her...WELL needless to say the sex scenes were enough for us to...Anyway I would tell anyone to get a copy the storyline is unique and there is something for everyone. The characters are vivdly portrayed and the connection each has one with another is well worth the read.
1,This book is more of a child-like cartoon.,"I started this book with high hopes. But, I was turned off very early on. The characters are not fully developed, I never felt any attachment, affinity, or like I really new who they were. The plot is very base,naive, and has alot of wholes. When people are upset in this book, they always vomit. Plus, the attempts at eroticism are forced and uncomfortable. My first thoughts when I did finally finish the book where ""What was that?"" I just can't recommned this novel in any way, shape, or form."
1,Horrifyingly bad book,"This is the worst book that I have EVER read in my life. I read this book a couple years ago. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. In fact I was only able to get through one chapter. It was clearly self-published because there is no publishing house on earth that would publish something so badly written. It was full of typos and was a grammatic nightmare. When I bought this book, there were some wonderful reviews about it. I must assume that these were all written by the author's families and friends. And the book description was clearly written by the author as well. I think that is a shame. I asked for my money back after buying this book. And I would suggest that others save their money for a book that it worth the time and cash spent. Zero stars in my opinion."
2,Where's Rumi?,"Persian period of that time is complex and formal. Mowlana is a master of poetry as well as a master of Sufi. His depth, artistry, and complexity is missing. I also find it a little deceptive to call oneself a ""translator"" when one does not read or speak the language from which he is supposedly translating."
4,Excellent PMP Practice Questions,Excellent material for use in studying for PMP exam. Well organized and presented. Included CD is an expecially good tool to use for studying for exam. I coupled this along with the Exam Cram book and the PMBOK and feel I'm well on my way to passing the exam.
2,Poorly written and inaccurate,"Don't buy this book! Haven taken a PMP exam prep class and reviewed the actual PMBOK, I purchased this book to help reinforce my knowledge prior to exam day. After only 3 chapters I found over 10 mistakes. Examples include inconsistently referencing knowledge areas as process groups and using terminology from the old PMBOK edition. In addition, the questions were poorly written with answers that don't correspond to the question.Overall this book is poorly edited and will confuse those without significant PM experience or formal PM / PMP education.Try something else."
3,Don't waste your money people WAKE THE F up!!!!,"I have searched everywhere high AND low for a new crimper because the one I used to have broke =[ it lasted me about 4 years and then gave out SO ANYWAYS, I bought this piece of garbage hoping it would crimp my hair like my other one did and THIS IRON IS CRAP!!!! DO NOT waste your money on it!!! DO NOT!!! I used the crimper and it doesn't even crimp my hair. I left it on for about 20 minutes so that it would get hot and then I crimped my hair and it still looked straight and then I put hairspray cus I thought maybe that would work and NOPE it still didn't and then yesterday I tried the barrel to curl my hair and the barrel works good, just the crimper SUCKS!!!"
4,It does the gob.,"Not so great if your in a rush. heating up takes a real long time, but cute for kids to use."
1,Not getting the hang of it :(,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas because a friend of her's had one and she really wanted it. Very disapointed so far. Does not do anything even as well as the straighteners and curling irons we already had. Not getting the hang of the spiral curler at all, maybe we need more practice, but it is not easy to use."
4,good ol' street punk,"If your a fan of any of the other GMM bands (Anti Heros, Templars, Pressure Point) then you should like this. Workng Class American Oi! anthems, If you can get your hands in Zero Hour buy that as well"
3,Pretty good shape book,This was a very special request for my Dad who passed away a few years ago. It is his favorite novel and his own was very ragged and falling apart is why I bought this for him. This arrived in a plastic bag and was found to be in fair condition.The spine was a little stretched but seemed to be holding up fairly well.I understand this is a very old science fiction story so that could lead up to why the book itself was old and worn.
2,yawn,"I read this about 45 years ago. I was in my late teens. At the time, I thought it was extremely profound. I read it a couple of weeks ago, I'm now 63. I now regard it as so so. The characters were unbelievable. with a years warning they did nothing to prepare for the survival of the species.John Beyerlein 23 Nov 2010Liz & Dick"
2,the movie was better,"What a disappointment!I love the movie starring Gregory Peck, Ava Garner and Fred Astaire. Itwas atmospheric and scary. I figured that such a good movie must come from agood book. Wrong!The book is poorly written, full of unlikeable characters-except for the captain-andit's full of Australian slang that isn't explained. A good concept wasted on a poorly written book.The movie made much more of the story and I can't wait to watch it again.Interesting that such a mediocre book made such a good movie.Save your money and buy the CD instead."
3,"Found by chance, enjoyed this very much...",I was searching for fiction similar in tone to McCarthy's 'The Road' and came across this older title. Very haunting read. Showcases believable common people and how they would conduct themselves while facing the impending nuclear doom. A great cautionary tale in our often uncertain times. Schools should make novels like this required reading moreso than some of the removed literary 'classics' in my opinion.
4,Australian SF Reader,"Nevil Shute's book about the collapse and extermination of civilisation after a nuclear war. The resulting devastating radiation effects from the Northern Hemisphere are taking some time to reach the Southern Hemisphere, but it too is doomed, including Australia.People know how long they have left in the history of the human race."
2,"No story, no substance.","This is the first book in a really long time that I found extremely difficult to finish.If you're looking for an entertaining story or deep character development, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a morbid, anti-climatic story with little plot and way too much superficial description, this is a book for you.On the Beach was written during the cold war, when the specter of a nuclear apocalypse was ever present. The book takes the ""we're all gonna die"" mantra to heart. Reading it during the times would have surely resonated, and this is the only real value of the book. It gives a peek into the morbid obsession with nuclear armegeddon.The book flatlines about 1/4th of the way through, and you spend the rest reading about the characters planting gardens, buying items, and other trivial boring crap. You keep expecting something to happen... but nothing does.If you want to read a good post-apocalyptic book from the era, I recommend Day of the Triffids or Alas, Babylon."
5,Sublime,"This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life, it is up there with Mauprat an Paula..."
3,On the Beach,I found this book to be slightly boring. It didn't help that it tended to have no climax and was very repetious. On the contrary I have learned what would happen if ever a severe nuclear war occurred.
5,Simple yet scary,"Nevil Shute uses no big scare tactics to try to make us wake up to the impending doom of nucuelar warfare in ""On the Beach"". Instead he uses quiet characters doing their best to live the life they've always wanted. Most of the characters in this book do not face the reality of impending death which makes it all the more sad when it does come. A fantastic book that should continue to be read even though the cold war is over."
4,"A little boring in some places, but enjoyable regardless.","The writing was somewhat dull, the bias against women was annoying (two women characters: one was a drunken slut, the other comparable to Rose of Sharon of the Grapes of Wrath, without coming into her own). So why did I enjoy this book? It's just one of those things. Such a classic portrayal of human nature stripped to the core is easily forgivable for any petty flaws. On The Beach was essential for its time. We all cringe to think about what the world would be like if we all knew when we would die, and how. Nevil Shute makes this a reality, bringing to life the unsettling details we've all thought about time and again. Maybe the writing is a little mundane, maybe the ideas are old-fashioned. Look past it. On the Beach is a worthwhile read."
4,Didn't quite fit Pioneer AVH-X1500DVD,"This kit didn't quite fit my new Pionoeer AVH-X1500DVD. The screw cut-outs in the small bracket that goes on the back of the radio did not go up high enough to catch the screw hole on the radio. I had to drill a hole about 1/8"" above the top of the slot. The whole bracket is plastic (for some reason I assumed the side brackets would be metal). The radio seems to be good and secure, so the product did fit my dash and the radio otherwise, besides having to drill the one hole.Note that it doesn't come with any screws, however the radio did (except for the bracket on the back (which takes an M4 8mm long max)."
5,Fit and Finish Were Perfect,I have a 2001 Ford Mustang GT and the Metra 95-5026 installation kit fit flawlessly and looks great with my new stereo installed. Thank you for the wonderful product.
1,Wrong part,"The product states ""2001-up Ford,"" and when you enter everything you are asked to ensure it fits your vehicle, you think you had the right thing. Check with other sites! When mine arrived, this definitely was not for my 2007 Ford F-150! The package read "" Ford double din multi-kit 2001-06"" but, I believed it fit because I check with ""Find parts that will fit your vehicle"" and it was wrong. I sure have believe the package! I modify the part and after installing the vehicle cover, I realize it leaves an empty place at the bottom of the cover. Lesson learned, I will have to order the right part (again) but this time, I am going with the site I should have gone to start with, Crutchfield.com. Sometimes cheaper cost you more. Anyways, any body interested in buying a modified double din kit for Ford 2001-06? ;-) no...I would not do this to you!"
2,Tiger Woods a no show,"Can't get the ball or Tiger Woods to show up, only the very top of his head. EA Sports tech support hasn't answered me back for a fix. There are better golf games out there."
3,Proctor Silex 24605 4 Slice Toaster,"Toasts OK, but doesn't have a cancel button if you set it too long, you have to pull the plug out of the wall receptacle!!!!!"
4,"good, decent toaster","I received this toaster before its estimated scheduled delivery date period. I used this morning to make toasted peanut butter and jam sandwich and it work great. It may not be top of the line, which is why I didn't give it five stars, but it toasted the bread and the bread wasn't too hot hold in my hand. I would recommend this just about as high as any other toaster on the market."
1,Total waste,"Beware, this battery does NOT function with the MiniDV Handycam DCR-HC96. After a few seconds the camera complains to ""use the InfoLithium Battery Pack"" and stops operating thereafter. Also the dimensions (LxBxH = 1 1/4"" x 1 3/4"" x 1 3/4"" ) may prevent the camcorder user to look through the eyepiece."
3,"Impressive, too long","Pynchon slips you a cocktail of pseudo-historical verse. Playful--his use of language is particularly impressive, even charming--but by the time they get to America far too many pages have passed and you begin to tire of the main characters' flattened personalities."
2,Flashes of great writing mixed in with Pynchon playing games,"Some years ago, after plodding through Gravity's Rainbow, I thought that Pynchon was not for me. Mason & Dixon confirms this. After reading reviews about this historical novel, I bought the book, looking forward to some good reading. Instead I found Pynchon's usual games: talking dogs, mechanical ducks, etc. I'm sorry but I don't use the same drugs as the author. When he does write along a storyline, Pynchon's writing is wonderful. Too bad he can't keep it up"
3,Dense and Quaint,"The author who is able to convey the humanity within galaxies and electrons alike, is now just being cute."
5,Excellent.,"Don't buy into any the ever fashionable 'it must be pretentious if its over 400 pages'. trap.(Granted,some writers to go for length oner substance-but not here). M & D is as good as promised and contrary to public opinion in this age of airport novels and talk-radio hosts topping best seller lists,its not THAT difficult to read and enjoy.The narrative is more or less linear,has 2 main characters,and a clear plot and setting .Sure,there are the Pynchon touches:goofy names,silly songs,unexpected digressions,and the ol' stand-by: paranoia (but really just hints of the desperation that other T.P. characters have faced).Bottom Line: Sure,it isn't John Grisham (there are plenty of made for movie novels,we don't need any more),-but it sure as heck ain't Ulysses either.There is no experience in modern reading like letting yourself (and a little reality)go and hanging out in Pynchon's very unique world"
2,"Learned and well-intentioned, but lacking greatness","As a fan of Pynchon's previous^M books such as GRAVITY'sRAINBOW, I was disappointed in this book. I saw no need for thearchaistic language, with the capitalization of every noun--why strive for this sort of ""accuracy"" when on the other hand you have such obviously parodic, postmodern devices such as the narrator being called Wicks Cherrycoke and George Washington speaking in Yiddish? There is an inconsistency here which suggests that Pynchon, once so footlose in the Sixties and Seventies, has become dutiful and academic, wanting to do the ""rifght thing."" Pynchon's speculations about surveying and the relationship between "" the Line"" and Enlgihtenment scientific mastery are interesting, but more in a ""learned"" way than in a way that would appeal to your typical reader of fiction. Pynchon is as good a writer as any alive today, but this book, though obviously well-researched and admirably serious, lacks greatness."
2,"Too exhausting to get to America, even","I read about 200 pages of aimless text (written in archaic 18th Century style), and then gave up. I defy anyone to find a plot or compelling characters in this book. If you want to try Pynchon, try The Crying of Lot 49, or, if you do want a book thick enough to stun an ox, Gravity's Rainbow."
5,Sailing to Philadelphia,"I was inspired to read this book by a Mark Knofler song, Sailing to Philadelphia. Although I am a veracious reader this was my first journey into the world of Thomas Pynchon and I had to completely readjust my reading style. Normally accustomed to reading a book in a day or two, I have been savoring Mason and Dixon for several months, reading a short passage, thinking about it, rereading it and moving on. It is a book unlike any I have ever read. To review it is impossible. The reading of it is a unique literary experience."
3,"Yin and Yang, Ping and Pong, Hither & Thither","I survived this book, if only just. I'm not sure if it's the best book I ever read, or perhaps the worst (or maybe both). Let's face it--this book is outstanding, but has a very limited audience. Don't feel like you have to be one of those precocious few who can follow the clever ramblings and tricksy references to 18th century culture."
5,Comprehensive Guide - A Must for Horse Owners,"This book is worth reading even if someone else is trailering your horse. Discusses options for trailers layout, and towing vehicles. Focuses on the safety and comfort of both humans and equines when heading out on the road."
2,gospel great praise and worship,I did not receive this dvd I got a cd instead I did receive a refund
1,PA-THETIC,"Please spare us all record company world. I love the Used, but u couldn't give us at least 1 new song? There has to be songs out there that were previously recorded on the 1st 2 cds that didnt make the final cut, no b-sides? no covers? They had a live dvd from their last cd too. I feel bad for the rest of the guys left in the band. I hope they stop charging ppl to be in thier fan club after this. Any must have fan out thier all ready has this."
1,Era bygone,"I adored this game a decade ago, but found it shockingly horrible today. You can't go home again, and I strongly suggest you don't if you have fond memories of this game as I did."
4,A good game - Not a revolution.,"Needless to say, NFS - Porche Unleased is a very solid game.It is definitely one of the most desirable driving games for the PC,and redundantly a must-have for a Porche fan/dreamer, provided that the minimum PC requirements are exceeded by 200%plus. Anyone familiar with the console gaming scene, will be quick to recognize its Gran Turismo-esque science, and Ridge Racer's stylish appeal (which is a good thing), with applicable refinements that a power of today's PC could provide. I haven't been a true fan of the series - partly due to its somewhat corny contents and lack of depth - but this new installment has definitely changed my impression. END"
2,"good newspaper, but without pictures not a good option","I do not now why European customers need to pay more than US customers for a product without any pictures?It would be a very great product if it would contain pictures, but this is a joke. Why amazon is treatingnot US customers like this? I have been contacting the online support, but there did give me no answers aboutwhy pictures are not available and about when pictures might be available in the future. That is not a good service..."
3,"faz inhalt gut, angebot über kindle überteuert","wir haben die druckausgabe abonniert + brauchen die faz übers kindle nur bei reisen. das klappt von schweden, polen, frankreich, italien bis sinai/ägypten hervorragend.allerdings hat der verlag die preise so erhöht, dass das kindle-abo der faz mehr als das druck-abo kostet. das ist ärgerlich, zumal den i-phone- + i-pad-nutzern der apple-faktion die faz fast geschenkt wird (eine android-ausgabe gibt es immer noch nicht + auch keinen nachlass für die abonnenten der druckausgabe). so schindet die faz umsatz + verärgert die abonnenten.wir haben daher das faz-kindle-abo gekündigt + kaufen höchsten bei grossem interesse mal eine faz-tagesausgabe übers kindle.schade, eine gute idee der kindleleute wird von den kaufleuten der faz kaputtgemacht."
2,Germany's Conservative Newspaper,"The FAZ is a good choice if you're interested in Germany's major conservative daily newspaper. Those who prefer a liberal or even centrist perspective should wait for the Süddeutsche Zeitung or the weekly Die Zeit, both of which will hopefully be available through Kindle soon."
1,Sad To Say,"Trash. If you're looking for typical VP style, it's not here. It's a rock lp rated ""zero"". I own the vinyl bought it at Woolworth's in the 80's for 50 cents of wothless quarters."
4,Air Quality Problem,"The sound these wonderful cables enable is certainly magical, with the right set of speakers (a set of God Botherer 823s are ideal) of course. However, there is still a problem that the true audiophile will immediately notice - the sound is still not quite perfect. The reason turns out to be the atmosphere, it's just too full of dust, pollen and a mixture of gases that takes the edge off the divine sound these cables are capable of producing.A few grand spent on advanced air filtration systems for your music room or home theatre will make all the difference, but to enable these fantastic cables to really do their job you need to replace the sound-degrading gases in the atmosphere as well. Carbon dioxide has to go for a start, then if you're really hard-core you'll dump the oxygen as well - one atmosphere of pure nitrogen enables these babies to truly bring you the music of the spheres, you'll think you've died and gone to heaven. Because you have!"
2,Capital T and some other letters spell Trouble,"I was looking at some of these crazy reviews for the AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cables and couldn't imagine why someone would write a clearly fake review of an extremely expensive set of audio cables.But when the image of the cables began to move across the screen, I thought I should warn you people. It is late and things are getting weird.Now its crawled out of the monitor and attached itself to my face. It's getting hard to type. It's wrapped itself around my neck and now the end of it looks like it is getting ready to drive itself into my"
5,Marvelous Stocking Stuffer,"God Bless You EveryoneI read about this AudioQuest K2 terminated speaker cable - UST plugs 8' (2.44m) pair and immediately thought it might fulfill my quest for stocking stuffers. Amazon has only one left, and I need 6 for the stockings. I found that these cables are only sold in stores in Texas. Of course, everything is big in Texas. I can purchase an 8 foot cable for $8,450, so that takes care of the big guy. The others will have to do with the lesser cable. I know that no one wants dissension at Christmas time,and I am hoping my family will not get into an all out fisticuffs. I do the best I can, what more can a family want? OK never mind. Merry Christmas, Everyone!Highly Recommended prisrob 11-26-10"
3,use 2 for balanced i/o operation,"these cable only shine when they are used in balanced config. so, you need two of them (one goes in phase and the other goes 180degrees out of phase). they do make an interconnect adapter for that (its mentioned on the paperwork, just below the co-signer agreement on your loan). when configured for fully balanced mode operation, you are rid of annoying ground noise. NB: you may have trouble getting it to work if you are on the 2nd or higher floor (your impedance from ground is too high, then) but if you live in a bungalow you should be fine."
5,The clarity of my SM-57 shines like the sun,The clarity and richness of my 44.1k 16 bit CDs shine through like the sun's rays in a latrine. You can almost hear the nicotine resin on the drummer's fingertips rubbing against the maple grained sticks being so beautifully recorded through the SM-57 microphones. Absolutely brilliant and a bargain at only $8000. Don't be fooled by those cheap thousand dollar cables.
1,Not the best taste,"Arrived in the stated time. The taste is not for me. I like chai tea, but this one is not at all anything I would drink. Some may like it though, everyone is different."
5,Pure Quality,Typical video collections use masters from dubious sources. Not here! I've never seen or heard these classic videos so clearly. Hats off to Universal for giving these gems the quality treatment they deserve. I hope they publish more volumes.
2,TRY THIS INSTEAD !!!,"IF YOU SEEM TO LIKE THIS DVD.THERE IS A BETTER ONE OUT THERE.THE [MTV-20 COLLECTION DVD]YOU GET 4 DVD'S FOR AROUND THE SAME PRICE AS THIS ONE!AND YOU GET SONG'S OF ROCK,POP,LOVE AND R&B; OF THE EARLY 80'S AS WELL AS EARLY 90'S.I RATHER HAVE 4 DVD'S THEN 1 FOR THE SIMILER CONTENT & PRICE !!!{ROME,NEW YORK:HOME OF WOODSTOCK 1999}"
4,Excellent for Christian Investigators not of Orthodox Heritage,"This title provides a captivating look at the Orthodox Church, past, present, and future. While not written as such, the first few chapters indeed present themselves quite excitingly. One can tell that the early and Byzantine church was a period of which the author is very proud.However, when relating the history of the church in the early 20th century, the author tends to become a bit confusing, which is somewhat understandable considering the times in which the book was written.Most of the text is still relevant, but as the Iron Curtain fell, the position of the church in former Soviet republics changed. For historians of Eastern Europe during the Cold War Era, this presents a captivating viewpoint of a theologian struggling to advocate for a faith tradition that is long, proud, and storied, but for general readers this section may indeed be useless, because much of that information is now anachronistic."
5,SueF,Mr Upfield returned to the outback for this story and his description of the people and places are most interesting. He brings Australia to your sitting room.
1,It SUCKED,This book is sooooooo boring. Discription after discription. I fell asleep on it about 6 times. I reccommend that nobody read this horrible book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,A Nausiating Expierience,"OK unlike many of the other readers for Grapes of Wrath, I disliked it completely. Yes it does tell the story of the migrant workers in California. And yes John Stienbeck is discriptive. But his way of writing was completely boring to me. I had to literally force myself to read this book. It was far too long and too slow. When I was done this book I had to take a nap it was so bad. His writing is not nearly as good as other authors. Stienbeck is considered a great author, but not by me. Save yourself some pain and do not read this book unless you have to!"
1,"Try again, Stienbeck","This novel is an awful book. Steinbeck lapses between having actual historical information and having his novel. Aside from being confusing, the novel is exceptionally long and boring. I would not recommend anyone read this book."
3,A little too selfish,"I was a bit disappointed by this little book. It starts interesting (the first couple of chapters) but then it looks more like Gelernter wants to showcase his personal ideas about how a computer could be beautyfull (both aestethic and scientifically), that to explain how beauty can be found in science. Maybe that's what should be expected, but I think the topic is much more interesting than just his personal views on it. Anyway, it makes a fun (if short) read."
5,The 'Killer' London Sessions,"This album really speaks for it's self. It was produced in 1972 and Jerry Lee is accompanied by some of Britain's finest musicians eg, Rory Gallagher, Albert Lee, Peter Frampton, Alvin Lee, Delaney Bramlett and the entire cast from Albert Lee's band 'Head Hands & Feet'. You have to remember that all these musicians were in absolute awe of Jerry Lee and considered him a living legend. This album covers all the influences that spurred Jerry Lee along, from gospel, blues, country, soul, all ingredients that have inspired the 'Killers' unique and vibrant form of Rock n' Roll. He covers such artists as Jimmy Reed, Big Bill Broonzy, CCR, Chuck Berry, Ray Charles and Little Richard. The selection of songs on this album and the backing musicians is what drew me to it, but of course the main attraction is the wonderful and enigmatic style of Jerry Lee Lewis. I was also surprised by the quality of this recording, for all Jerry Lee fans this is a must have CD."
4,This is NOT the first time this has been released on cd!,"Just to set the record straight, Polygram issued this on cd (with limited liner notes) in the early days of CD's. I've had it in my collection for years! The music is classic Killer! Long may he live!"
3,4 Stars for the Music - subtract one for the sound!,"I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that the sound on this cd is quite pitiful - compare No Headstone on My Grave to the All Killer No Filler version for proof.It would be great if Bear Family would release this on cd in a proper version because there are some fine performances here, starting with No Headstone and also Drinkin' Wine. No Headstone in particular is incredible, moving from slow to fast tempo with urgent vocals from JLL - plus the great spoken ending ""Don't Put a Headstone on My Grave - I want a monument! (laughter) This is the Killer speaking........"""
4,Awesome graphics and lots of fun!,"The graphics on this anime is truly awesome. Attention to detail, especially on the cars, is truly impressive. That is understandable, considering car chases are the main theme of this anime. Very vibrant and fun anime to watch."
4,"Fun, not astounding!","It's a good game. It was a decent diversion, but soon enough, I was sucked back into Battlefield 2142. This has great graphics though."
2,Pretty darn pathetic,"JeSUS! Who designed the control system for this game? Anybody?It looks pretty, I'm sure it's even interesting, but you find yourself repeating parts over and over and OVER again so often because the control system is so cock-eyed that it sucks any fun out of it that you might have been having!And the camera sticks to the reverse angle so many times that you have no idea where you're running to! Congratulations Eidos, you've created the first Second Person shooter! Experience everything from the point of view of the target!"
4,Awesome but...,"This isn't going to be a long essay of a review because let's be honest, who has time to read 5 paragraphs worth of stuff? This is a great game, but my biggest problem with it is that it's too short. The rest of the Tomb Raider games all had somewhere between 15-20 levels. And this one has...8? That's it? BUT they are very good levels that require a bit more thinking than the last few games, although AOD had some good thinky stuff too.And my last gripe is for all of you who can't pronounce a name properly...It's LARA Croft. NOT Lora, NOT Luara, but L-A-R-A. It's phonetic. Read what you see. Ok, that's it for me."
3,"Great insight, great writing but where's the tension","As I was reading this book I enjoyed what I was taking in. Only problem was that the story never really went anywhere. I thought for sure Raheim would either come out or be found out creating the tension and a chance for some riveting writing. What happens when a B-Boy is discovered being something else other than he is perceived. In the African-American culture, sadly, being gay is catastrophic and tragic. The outcome could be devastating to a person like Raheim who has lived his life a certain way and has to face alienation from, for example, his son's mother and straight friends(home-boys)who have their own ideas of what a man should be. Most importanly, I believe Hardy missed the boat on what could have been a great chapter on a black mother coming to terms with her gay son without falling into stereotypes and a movie-of-the-week ending. Hardy is too good of a writer for that trapping."
5,Great Quality,"This keychain is surprisingly nice quality and really sturdy. It's not very large, so don't expect a prominent piece. Got this for the boyfriend and he loves it."
3,about this DVDfilm/movie water drops on burning rocks.......,"This film story is basically about a young man hintersted in an older man where they praticed gay sex and later in the film where their woman came to find them and the later the yong man's woman praticed sex with the older man and he killed himself due to the yong man troubled and unhappy over the older man's reaction to their man to man's relationship...that's all....I views this film based on the hongkong's version and give this film a 3 star due to the fact that this film is talking about deviant type of loveship.Water Drops On Burning Rocksreview written by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kahdirector 'lou ye'- Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
4,good,"very unique film. Boy has older male lover and his ex girlfriend tries to rekindle an old relationship with boy. Odd, but worth a watch. Great cast, unique story."
4,Good but the lock isn't.,"A nice mailbox and certainly more secure that what 99% of the public has. My only complaint is the lock. It is cheap, the aluminum key is hard to get into the lock and hard to get out of the lock. (Aluminum keys are easily bent.) I used some WD-40 which helped a little but I am not satisfied with the lock. I would advise having some lock deicer as well. My lock froze after a cold, near freezing rain. I am shopping for a better quality lock."
5,loved it,Was for my own home. Match the color of my house exactly . Certainly added value to my property! Thank you
5,Great mailbox,I bought one and now half my block has the exact same. The peace of mind knowing no one can take your mail is awesome. It holds quite a few days of mail for those families that travel. I love not having to depend on the postal service to stop our mail when traveling.
4,Advanced Schutzhund,"The book was very informative, but I wouldn't suggest that a person without a strong working knowledge of training dogs reads this book untill they become more familar with dog training and the sport of Schutzhund."
2,Born to Lose,"I personally as a gambler didn't get much out of this book. It was written along time ago. I personally think I could of done a better job. This book emphasized on GA alot and I would of liked to of seen more on self banning, more on woman experiencing this problem.I didn't care for it although some loved it."
1,Do not buy anything from Acoustic Reality Expirience,"I have bought 3 titles from this company; 1 HDDVD and 2 blu ray. The HD DVD and one of the BD were awful. Though they are 7.1 surround, it seems that original ""master"" could have easily been from an 8 track. The second BD was not even recorded correctly thus it was unusable, the audio was like a 45 RPM disc playing at 33RPM and the video portion did not even work. From the many different music BD's (>20) ranging in genre from opera to rock and roll that I have purchased this is the only label that I would rate as utter trash. Again DO NOT BUY ANY RECORDINGS FROM ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPIRIENCE, they are a complete and utter rip-off. Avoid this label like the plague. Caveat Emptor."
4,Great if you can find it for $60,"I got this boombox for my RoadyXT. Shop around for the best price. I paid sixty-dollars. Don't pay two hundred bucks for this!Sound is great for a large room. There is a quiet hiss when played at low volume. This hiss is also audible through the headphones. Not recommended for quiet listening in a bedroom or small room. But for a portable way of listening to satellite radio, this boombox works well.The Delphi Premium Sound System has a line-in, and probably better sound, but it is more than twice the price of the Belkin boombox.For the price, this one works as it should. Not audiophile-quality sound. But fine for barbecues or filling your kitchen with satellite music."
2,Missing Pages,"Book looks great but when I got to King Lear, the whole second act was missing as was the whole first act of Macbeth. I'm returning the book beyond the return deadline and hopefully will get a full refund. Check the 1200's when you get your book."
1,mumbles strikes again,Segall mumbles alot in this flick. Movie is disjointed and makes no sense. Characters are introduced that have no connection to the story. Segall stunt double is pretty good.
5,Best beginner's book in Mathematica...,"I got the 1998 printing of this book, which treats Mathematica 3., but not 4.+. So some of the formatting for the commands is not quite right, but a 4.+ user can use the Help Browser in Mathematica to correct for these.This book is written at a freshman/sophomore level, and includes enough basics to be useful for a Calc I through Calc 3 student, Linear Algebra student, and Intro Statistics student. Some of the 3D plots are truly beautiful, such as the hyperboloid in one sheet. These authors have a full grasp of parameterization, which is necessary for some plots (e.g., the hyperboloid in one sheet).So--a great intro, with more content than other intro Mathematica books."
3,Return Policy,Just wanted to remind others that a lot of items require you to pay the return shipping. I am a loyal Amazon shopper and I think that they do a great job - but - lots of other websites pay return shipping for shoes. I ended up having to pay over $6.00 to return the shoes to Amazon b/c they didn't fit. I still have to go out today and buy white sandals for my daughter. Lesson learned for me! Next time I buy her online shoes I'll use the site that has free returns!
2,tech problems,"I have a pentium 2 400mhz with a riva tnt2 vidio card. I cant get the game to work. Neither can my friends who have twice the computer I have. The demo was great, but this game is a heartbreaking letdown."
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"Shogun is an EXCELLENT game, BUT IS UNPLAYABLE ON MOST OF THE BRAND NEW SYSTEMS OUT TODAY. Due to terrible EA techinical support, and horrible compatibility issues, Shogun doesn't work on my BRAND NEW 900mhz computer. I know for a fact that most people with an Nvidia graphics card CANNOT play Shogun. Electronic Arts (manufacterer of shogun) neglects the problem and refuses to patch their game to work with Nvidia drivers. The game also does not work on Windows Millenium computers. PLEASE keep this in mind before buying ANY game from Electronic Arts. The company obviously neglects to give their customers honest tech support and neglects to make sure their games even work!"
1,Buyer Beware! STW won't work with Ge Force Drivers!! Read--,"Nice game, but I've just upgraded my PC to a Ge Force video card, and STW will not run if you have Ge Force drivers! Check ea.com and under technical support this is all thoroughly documented. There doesn't seem to be any patch or fix forthcoming according to what I'm reading there. And that's a shame because it's a fine game. Check Ea.com's website for an official announcement about this problem being fixed before buying."
1,Animal Farm,"All these people who wrote good reviews are insane, or shamelessly politically biased.This book is Animal Farm, if you are a employee of Immi Truth from 1984. They are rewriting history people, and marketing a socialist ideal to our childeren.George Orwell must be rolling around in his grave.This an example of the worst kind of brain washing. VERY 1984, to try and indoctrinate the childeren into the INGSOC mentality."
5,My son loves it!,"I borrowed this from the local library to read to my son and it soon became his favourite book. I love it! I especially like the picture of Farmer Duck rounding up the hens - he looks crazy and it makes me laugh! It's funny to imagine a duck doing all that farm work! You feel empathy and sympathy for the duck. It's a great book that kids can memorise too. Go, Farmer Duck, go!! Although, I did find it rather interesting that the duck was giving the orders to the animals at the end of the book. You'd think he'd be grateful that they got rid of the lazy farmer, and instead he's bossing them around! He, he, he."
2,fingers too small for scissors!,I do like the tweezerman tweezers so bought the scissors. They are very sharp and workWell. The problem is if your a woman with small hands the sccisaor grip is too wide and shimmysDown past your knuckles and gets stuck. You have to relax your hand and shake the scissors off.If you are a woman and you hate getting rings stuck on your fingers you won't like these scissors.
3,Hardcore MMA fans only.,"I got this collection because I like to watch MMA. BJ Penn is one of my favorite fighters. Gomi vs Penn is a classic. A few bad things tho, the sound quality on some of the earlier ROTR is horrible. The camera angles are crappy at times. During the Rodrigo Gracie vs BJ fight, the camera looks into the crowd(during a fight) instead of THE fight ARRGGHHH!!! Other than that it was an ok collection. If you are a casual MMA fan, I wouldn't recommend it because there are a lot of fighters that you may not have heard of. For hardcore MMA fans only. Hawaii in the HOUSE!!!"
4,They are great,"I expected them to be a bit thicker, anyhow, I like them. Pink is very pale, Red is beautiful, blue is very nice, white is just ok."
2,Poor Pictures,"I have gone through a few digital cameras. My first was a Kodak. It took great pictures but was too big to just stick in my pocket. My next purchase was an Olympus. It was very compact with great feautres but took TERRIBLE pictures.Then I purchased the Sony DSCW90B. I like the size, but that is about it. 90% of the pictures I take do not come out well at all. Also, the lag time between pictures seems to be forever. It is way too slow to capture small children playing and wildlife. Since I purchased it a few months ago, I am stuck."
3,Image blurring,I am interested in this camera but it seems like it blurs a lot when the subject is moving or the camera is shaking.I am having doubts about its anti-blur technology.Is anyone having some issues with blur?
4,not bad,its pretty good for a regular digital camera...the battery life is pretty long..even with flashes...I wish all the accessories for the HD hookup came included
3,Kindle Format: Awful. Story: Delightful,"I love the story, but the Kindle formatting in this particular version is awful. I couldn't stand to read it. The illustrations were not there; just notations indicating that there was supposed to be an illustration. And the formatting was centered instead of left aligned or justified. You're better off spending 3 bucks to get the complete Dickens collection on your Kindle.The Complete Charles Dickens Collection (51 books) [Illustrated]"
3,crosseyed,"Just wanted to give potential buyers a warning that your copy, like mine, might have 'shifted plates'? Not sure what to call it but every page was double printed causing a ghosting effect throughout the book. Unfortunately it's unreadable."
5,!funny!,"absolutely hysterical! i love these guys and im glad to see them do another show. i like ron white, but i think the show without him is a lot cleaner."
2,A few small delights - and a fistful of clangers,"""Very Best of""? OK, they're *really* reaching on this one. There's four or five examples of Mr Skellern's best - most of which are available on other albums. The very successful ""You're a Lady"" is not however on any other Skellern CD's sold in the US and perhaps for some, just getting that one track may make the whole purchase worthwhile. Not for me. I was extremely disappointed in the remaining 14 or so tracks; it would be bad enough if they're weren't really his best, but unfortunately it's much worse than that - they're real stinkers. Don't get me wrong, I really like Skellern's brand of music - despite the fact that the man can't hold a note. He has a delightful way of reviving old classics and making them fresh again.But skip this album, there's not enough here to justify the price tag. Maybe there's a reason Amazon won't let you preview the tracks on this CD.........."
2,What is this ?,I recieved this slide today and am not really impressed.Looks thicker on the web site.I play dobro and thought this might be easier.It sounds like chrome over tin.Its a waste of money.If you are new to slide guitar I wouldnt try this one.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,This game is the most overhyped game in history. The graphics and gameplay is almost identical to the first Medal of Honor game. The load times between levels are horrible and the AI of the enemy and your teammates is like Forest Gump. I can't say enough bad things about this game.I bought this game thinking it should be in the same league as Rainbow Six 3...... not even close. This game is flat out terrible.
2,Waste of time,"Hmm, what to say about this game. Its pretty ""meh"". It doesn't do anything well, and does a number of things pretty badly. I would not suggest this game to anyone looking for a FPS. The AI was horrible, weapons were bland and boring to fire. They all sounded underpowered (and pretty much are underpowered). The level design is pretty bad, everything is scripted and feels like a shooting gallery. The teammate AI is horrible and doesn't help at all. In fact, they get in the way most of the time. The graphics are horrible too. Overall the game feels pretty old fashioned and more like it was made by a mod team then an actual developer. The only cool thing about it is the cut scenes that are actually pretty neat. I am surprised I bothered finishing this one."
2,Does not live up to expectations,"The lineup of musicians, which makes it seem like an all-star extravaganza, coasts through most of this. Nicky Marrerro, Jimmy Ponder, Andy Gonzalez, and the ""who's who"" roster of New York Latin and Soul Jazz masters fail to lift this one past mediocrity. ""St. Thomas"" and ""Montuno Merengue"" might be the exceptions, but it is clearly not enough.This is a deathtrap for the curious."
5,A GREAT NEW PATRIOTIC SONG,They seem to have captured the emotion and feelings of a nation with this song. I've just about worn out my cd. I guess I better rip and and play it on my iPod.The Sfarzo's music is a lot of fun and this one is a real tear jerker.
3,"Zappa fans, check this out!","I rented this movie under the advice of a coworker and was a little bothered at first because it seemed to drag on with no real direction. One thing I did like was that the teacher set Frank Zappa's music as the highest bar to reach at the school. In the end the kids get to go to Germany and play at a Zappa fest called ""Zappanale"". Napoleon Murphy Brock joins the kids (between nine and seventeen years old) for ""Inca Roads"". And they do a fantastic job! If you are a Zappa fan I think you would probably enjoy this movie as much as I did. Just stick with it to the end."
3,They left out my favorite song!,"Would it kill them to include ""Bungle in the Jungle""? And before you ask, I've checked the rest of the DVDs & Blu-rays, and it's nowhere to be found! No love for my favorite song...it's a damned shame. :("
2,Big Disappointment,"This is what longtime Jethro Tull fans waited nearly two years for? You'd think with technology being what it is today, they could have made this in a 5.1 or DTS sound format. Instead we get 2.0 from a band that would have sounded superb in 5.1.As for the video production, when will musicians and their producers realize true fans want a concert without all of the silly effects? And do we really need interview segments after each song? Make the interviews another segment of the DVD features.This is my all-time favorite group. Sadly, this DVD does not do Jethro Tull justice."
2,"Thank goodness for the acoustic songs, otherwise.....","Man - this has to be one of the lamest rock concerts ever filmed.I'm a huge fan and have seen Tull several times in the good old days (when they played music with PASSION) - but I don't know what was worse...the ""don't dare get out of our seats, for we may not be able to find our way back"" crowd, or the ""make sure we play this song the same way for 20 years and try not too look like we want to blow our brains out"" band. The two acoustic songs with strings in Anderson's living room save this DVD...a real intimate musical moment of two great songs.... if only there were more of that."
4,Lots of Ballads,"This is a well-presented package; you get nice perspective on Miles' life and on the sessions that produced these music.The music itself is varied. As a listening experience, it's clear that Miles tended towards ballads and towards interpreting popular songs through his trumpet. I prefer the weightier parts on here ... ""The Serpeent's Tooth"" (great underheard theme) ... Sonny Rollins' compositions ... much of the music is centered on a singular melody line though.So, it's interesting music (there's a who's-who of 50's jazz musicians moving through the credits) but to me less so than Miles 60's quintet, or Miles 1970's explorations in funk."
2,Many errors in exercise steps & missing/misplaced files - CD,"Author has a lot to say but either he or the publisher did not invest in the the time to assure the exercise steps were correct, the files on the CD were placed correctly, or there at all, and that all the details of filter dialog boxes were clealy stated in relation to previous exercises. There are a few Photoshop 3.5 pictures still in the book. Author did a reasonable job making this usable by Windows computers by it is a Mac book. Read for content but do not waste your time on the exercises."
3,"Okay, it's a battery charger","I may be a little naive, but I was expecting an actual battery with my battery charger. Other than that, it's fine. It works and it charges the battery in the stated time."
5,Outstanding set!,"A definite improvement over the tepid soundtracks to ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""Goldeneye"". ""The World Is Not Enough"" soundtrack is a perfect compliment to the film- exciting, energetic, fun. Bond fans will enjoy."
4,SOME VERY GOOD TRACKS,"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH soundtrack is a pretty good James Bond soundtrack. The title song is only O.K. but there are some good tracks on the CD. The best tracks are: 3(Come in 007 your time is up), 6(Welcome to Baku), 8(Ice Bandits), and 12 (Pipeline). Number 3(Come in 007 your time is up) has a lot of the James Bond theme in it and is a fast paced track. Number 6(Welcome to Baku) is a good steady kind of India-like version of the James Bond theme. It is too short though. 8 (Ice Bandits) is a good fast-paced track with a great instrumental of the World Is Not Enough. You know what I mean by instrumental. Not the entire song, just a few instrumental parts in Ice Bandits. And finally, 12(pipeline) is a very fast paced, tense, suspenseful, and exciting track. You really have to listen to it well for it to be a suspenseful track. All in all it is a good soundtrack. Minus one star for some boring tracks though."
5,I love Neopets !!!,"I love Neopets. im 24, And my boyfriend, My girl like neopets too. I have electronic/pocket neopet, cards, rare item code I hope this game will be great! Im buying this game too when it comes out! :) :), and this is why I give this game 5 stars, I have not played this game yet, and I am basing this review on the www.neopets.com websight. On the websight"
2,Caged Canary,"With the attention-grabbing theme of time travel, Curry could have gone far into the literary cosmos with this text but instead the book runs out of fuel far short of where this plot could have ventured. She goes into long, rambling descriptions of incidential items and flash backs almost losing her young readers in wordy passages barely connected to preceeding thoughts. Curry could have done a better job with the main character's impressions of 17th century London. The author should have better expressed the differences in the character's life in two different worlds instead of describing rocks, curtains and feathers, etc.I purchased this book as a donation for a school library. I hope the youngsters don't get lost in this book's outer space of disconnected words. Curry kept this canary in the cage."
2,Yucky,"What is this? Not even good as a stand alone effort apart from IM. Considering that this new sound calls themselves Iron Maiden, it's worse. Not recommended - try Dance With Death."
4,"Intelligent,powerful,give it a try!","Even though Blaze Bayley has been blamed-unfairly so-for the decline of this band,listen to this album;the trademark sound is there coupled with intelligent lyrics that attempt (succesfully)to move beyond the limitations of the past.This is one of the better Iron Maiden albums."
2,X FACTOR BLOWS,"The problem is not Blaze Bayley. His vocals are good. The problem is the music. The first 3 tracks and ""Judgement of Heaven"" are pretty good songs, but the rest sound like crappy remixes of ""Afriad to Shoot Strangers"". The rifts are REALLY repetative and the lyrics are horrible. The agony reaches it's peak at ""2 AM"" when it music goes from slow down to a crawl. Anyone who likes X Factor hasn't been listening to Bruce. If you want heavy metal that goes a step up from classic maiden (rather than a fall on the a**), get Bruce Dickinson's ""The Chemical Wedding"". ========BAHUMUTH"
1,X-Factor,As a Maiden fan I was very disapointed by this album. Not because of a new singer not because of the music was bad its actually some of the best but because of the lyrics. As someone who loved old Maiden for there ghastly images and mainly non-Christian subject matter I was dissapointed to here an album where a singer is essentually whining because God dosen't seem to like him and wants his faith back. To me this is an insult to the large Paganistic/Atheistic fan base Maiden has. This also makes them less like a early Slayer and more like an early Stryper. So unless you can turn off the lyrics and your a non-Christian don't buy this album.
4,sign of the cross is overrated,"i love this album! but i dislike sign of the cross..especially when it gets into the typical fast iron maiden mode(rock in rio version is better)...that being said i usually skip to lord of the flies...i love that song..blaze really shines there..man on the edge throws more kick arse riffs at us...steve harris sounds good on that one...fortunes of war is one of my favorites...i think of it as the sequel to afraid to shoot strangers from the previous album. look for truth is a slower darker song to continue the album's dark nature. again a good song. blaze is a good vocalist. i am curious to have seen what brave new world would have been like if blaze would have stayed. i recommend this album to goth metal fans and dark rockers and such. typical long hair band lovers will hate this album im sure. if you get wood to powerslave and number of the beast you will probally hate this as well. if you are open minded this will be good, very good. 4.5 stars actually!"
1,I can't follow it..,"I can only understand that only die-hard Maiden fans could possibily affirm that this (...)is the best Iron Maiden album ever!!! MAIDEN released absolutely nothing worth your money since SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON. The nineties were a total mess in their previously immaculate discography, mainly thanks to the exit of Adrian Smith and, later, Bruce Dickinson. The bands clearly sounds tired in X FACTOR. I'm not gonna take time to talk about Blaze. Just the songs. They are and endless pool of boredom. Ok, I admit it sounds darkier, another vibe, but the doesn't mean it's good. Both Maiden CMC albuns (this one and Virtual Eleven) are below standard material. THat's the simple reason they hired Dickinson and Amith back!!"
1,"Recorded, written, and Maiden hell","""Nothing is ever the way it should beWhat we deserve we just don't get you see...""-""Man on the Edge"", Iron MaidenTruer words may never have been spoken.With a delivery flatter than the bridge of Nicko McBrain's nose, new vocalist (and comically-monikered) Blaze Bayley does his damnedest to dig Iron Maiden's (and music in general) grave with this effort. Even the patented guitar chops of Jannick Gers can't save this bomb, which left me reeling over two quarts of chili bean and Schlitz-infused puke. The whole thing is a travesty really, a sonic mess that does nothing but cause split ends in my ear hair.Kevin DuBrow must be spinning in his grave."
1,Bad transfer,"About the worst transfer ever! Video is horribly bad, seems like it was taped from a T.V. with snowy reception. Don't waste your money. Bad, bad, bad!!!"
3,"Great reading, but hard to use.","Most people have been focusing on the positives, and I agree with them; it's a great book.I have two main grievances against the book, however. First, it's immensely thick. I find it difficult to carry it around with me to class if I have both my netbook and binder with me; my backpack is not small. My other grievance is almost as bothersome. The pages are very thin, which makes the ink from the next page show up clearly (to a point where you can usually make out what the next page says without flipping pages.) Here's a photocopied page, hopefully which constitutes fair use. http://i53.tinypic.com/23ueszc.jpgAn e-book version of this would be perfect, but I didn't see one of this, plus I don't have an e-reader yet. Again, it's a great book, but a pain to use. I have to take off two stars simply for that."
1,Never arrived.,"Placed an order, and waited over a month, and it never even shipped, much less arrived. Unacceptable for ordering school books, it put me behind on my class.Not reccomended."
5,perfect,"The finest piece of historical fiction ever written.Much of Unsworth's other works (while excellent), Pascali's Island and Rage of the Vulture come to mind, had deep flaws, and fail to convey well the obvious efforts of the author.Sacred Hunger succeeds on every possible level. It is a work of unmatched genius in its genre, and only John Coetzee and Peter Carey can apporach it's depth and importance among living writers. Amongst the dead, this rates with Tolstoy, Hemmingway, Faulkner, and Camus (Dostoevsky, of course, is untouchable). It is a work of pure and perfect literature."
4,Awfully good -- tho' I'd add rosemary and mescal,"This novel really does have it all --plot, moral content, characterization, all masterfully served up. Perhaps 'Sacred Hunger' could have been slightly more modern and less literal. I would have enjoyed a tad more surreality, some unexpected wry swank."
4,Good read,"I liked the turnaround where the hero, Chad Foster, is the one being stalked and the bodyguard is the heroine, Jenna Wakefield. You get to hear his inner dialogue dealing with the unease and feelings of helplessness generated by the unknown stalker.A good combination of romance and suspense."
4,Excelent Album but BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"As far as the record it self goes, this is a classic ""now sound"" release. Fat Moog synth, wordless vocals, the whole nine yards. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about these being different recordings. Spaced Out is my favorite among the 30 or so Enoch Light records I own and this is the exact same album as my vintage Project 3 LP.However, here's the problem, this CD was clearly mastered from an LP. While the transfer isn't terrible, you do hear typical record noise which is really dissapointing. Add in the ""low budget"" packaging and lack of licensing information, I have to question the legality of this one.Still, you can't beat the price and if you don't want to take the time to burn your LP to a CD (or if you can't find a copy of the LP) this will do. Not an unpleasant listening expirence, but this album deserves better."
3,spaced out pop a la beatles,"nice CD, groovy sounds, but short in length and the recording is not so good. But the songs are catchy and tuneful."
5,lovely,"Great voice , enjoyed this for many years, too bad the cd is price prohibitive. Hope you can rectify that soon."
4,Great Background Great Data,This books begins with a complete discussion on the benefits of a passive solar design built house along with the data to help you on your way. Worthy purchase.
4,Not a definitive book on passive solar,"Kachadorian knows passive solar building in New England and presents what he knows well. Those looking to build in the southwest or southeastern United States (or elsewhere) could certainly benefit from passive solar principles, but probably won't find much specific help here.I am still looking for the book that presents the subject of passive solar broadly. There seem to be many applications and forms for passive solar heating/cooling/lighting to be explored, especially in conjunction with other forms of sustainable building. I would highly recomend Alternative Construction from Wiley Publishers for those interested."
1,junk,total never did any thing for me. a big waist of time money and space. i threw it away immediately.
2,Brother Can U Spare A Dime???...Ya Need It!!!,"Not feeling this at all...........There were too many holes in the plot, like the one where the mother's death appeared to be ""random"" on the video survealance but turned out to be a set up? Huh? You got to do better than that. It started off good but got too predictable and too stereotypical. Nope!..........Not today or any other day man."
2,Movie stunk- HDDVD was good...,"The movie itself was not very good. It was like watching a Lifetime channel movie with bad neighborhood fosterhome brothers inserted. There wasn't as much action or ""revenge action"" as I was hoping for and the script was not that great. On the HD side, things were better. The video transfer is great and shows the cold side of Detroit very well including all the blue-ish hues of the winter. No signs of artifacts and mostly very sharp. The sounds is fine also w/ just DD+ or Dts to choose from.An OK movie with a good, crisp looking HD transfer."
1,Guns and that is all,"All this movie was was guns and shooting and a hard to follow plot. If you like guns and blood, you may like it."
1,I gave it a shot...,"Maybe it's just the style of movies that I am into, you know... the artsy fartsy documentaries, dramas and movies that make you think about more important things other than guns and violence.I gave this movie a shot, no pun intended... to say the least. I was ready to shut it off after 20 minutes into it but decided that (for lack of anything else to do,) that I'd push myself to get as far through it as humanly possible. And that I did... I watched the movie in it's entirety and must say that it although wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was borderline the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting was that of a ""C"" class rated movie and although the plot of the movie was somewhat of an alright idea, the writers could've definitely worked a little bit more on other things that had happened.I'd say that if you like bad movies with guns, violence, horrible acting and attempted witty banter, that this is for you; otherwise, stay away!"
3,Good Movie!!!,"I just watched this movie on DVD had it for a while and finally decided to watch it. I thought it was pretty good the acting was kinda shaky in spots but overall a decent movie. Mark Wahlberg was good and so was Tyrese as well, Andre Benjamin acted well for a guy with little experience but he still needs work. I am from Detroit Mi so the movie was filmed almost entirely here. The plot was very good and the dialogue was good also. I give this movie 3 stars and I would recommend for people to get this DVD."
4,great,Just an all around great movie. Mixes all kinds of people and makes a family that stick by each other no matter what others say about them.
5,An Eye For An Eye,"If you like the old vigilante Charles Bronson type movies of the past, go see Four Brothers. It was awesome."
3,"Four brothers, three stars","The four adopted sons (Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, and Garret Hedlund) of a selfless woman (Fionnula Flanagan) who dedicated her life to the poor go on the warpath in a search for the truth and vengeance. The result is a pretty standard revenge flick with some good performances and a nice bit of poetic irony in the main villain's fate. Despite the concept of a mixed-race group that considers itself related, this is a merely decent rehash of material that has been done a thousand times before."
1,A Disaster,"Being an admirer of K Records and many of the artists associated with it, I was very excited to see this film. All I could think of while watching it, however, is how little I learned about K and its bands. This is not a documentary in any sense but a festival of self-congratulation and self-aggrandizing (with the exception of the most celebrated character -- Calvin Johnson -- who comes off as thoughtful and nearly heroic). It quickly becomes a promotional spot for Beat Happening, though we never hear the name Heather nor hear from or about her -- and she wrote and sang nearly half their songs! The director assumes a vast amount of former knowledge about K and the bands, then proceeds to sell their wares to us. Alienating. Runs counter to the spirit of the times and the music. An utter shame. And I can only look back in my memory for the real deal, cause I was there, & this wasn't even an hint of the story."
2,Not as good as the reviews say. . . . .,"I picked up this book about 1 1/2 years ago thinking that I'd find something that I could relate to, as I'm a 30 bipolar woman. Unfortunately, I could not relate to Lizzie Simon. She is elitist and she is very self-congratulatory. It is so embarrassing to read about her relationship with Nicholas, and somehow she thinks that she's the only one who could understand him. He can't understand himself!!! Needless to say, I don't understand what all the hype is when reading this book. I think there are plenty of people out there who have written excellent books on their struggles with mental illness (i.e Kay Redfield Jamison, William Styron). This book, though entertaining, is very base."
2,Simple how-to instructions,"This book is a simple how-to book for the home do-it-your-self novice brewer. The types of wine you can make was of most interest to me. Great ideas. And, of course, if you want to make ILLEGAL whisky, he gives you enought ideas to take off. Great, simple methods book."
3,Freddi Fish,"I was a little disappointed with this game. I had played other Freddi Fish games with my granddaughter, which were adventure games, and this game is strictly an arcade game. I'm sure my granddaughter will still enjoy it, but it is not what I thought I was buying."
2,Waste of money - didn't work,"Arrived quickly, no drivers included, did not work on Vista without drivers. Manufacturer and amazon unwilling/unable to provide working drivers. Amazon support unhelpful."
3,not his best,"I really love later Crichton, but this one was one of his earlier ones, and you can tell. It starts out VERY intriguing, and sets the reader up to keep the pages turning. However, towards the end he seems to try to wrap it up too quickly, and he left me saying, ""That's it?"" ""State of Fear"" and ""Prey"" hooked me in and left me saying, ""WOW!"" at the end. So I was a little disappointed. But still a good book."
3,the andrmeda strian,"the book was not as good as i expected. the begning was very good, but torwards the end it got too confusing. i think you sould read this book, but expect much from it. i think timeline was ten times better than this."
3,Not Bad,The Andromeda Strain was an ok book but it lacked main points and needs work (computer dialogue gets annoying). For example the end the virus seems to mutate. I guess overall it was a good book but The Hot Zone ( by Richard Preston) was much better. Would I recomend it after reading it? probably not but you should try it.
2,Slow,I listen to books on cd commuting on the highway so I'd like a little more action. This struck me more like science class.
3,The Andromeda Strain,"The Andromeda Strain is not written on the same level as Michael Crichton's best books, like Jurassic Park and Prey, The Andromeda Strain is only mediocre. The novel is about a government organization that sends satellites into space to collect space pathogens. When one of the satellites crashes and wipes out an entire town the Wildfire team is called upon. The novel opens up in a way that attracts the attention of the reader, and makes the reader want to read more and more. Throughout the novel Michael Crichton keeps the reader interested with a great plot and building up the climax. Though Michael Crichton does not follow the climax witha ending that finishes off a great book. Without a well written ending this novel, The Andromeda Strain, is only mediocre. This is not one of Michael Crichton's best novels."
3,Decent Crichton,"I have read a ton of Crichton over the years. So I decided to read some of his earlier work starting with the Andromeda Strain. Overall, the book was a good read. I didn't really like the ending."
3,Not bad; on the other hand not all that great either.,"I've read almost all of Crichton's novels and this seems second rate when compared to Sphere, Congo, and Jurassic Park. I've gotten use to the rigidity of Crichton's characters, and plot usually makes up by putting the characters in situations that they must immediately deal with. From this a reader of depth can draw their own characterizations and motivations for the characters. With this novel, however, the plot was often tedious and the writing seemed a bit contrived. Also, the biology error of having the entire population mutate instead of part of it mutating as the old population remains was rather glaring and dropped my rating from a 7 to a 6."
5,"""There isn't anything in the world . . . ""","THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was written while Michael Crichton was in medical school. Arguably, this is his best book, written at the height of the U.S. Space Program, and guaranteed to terrify the reader with its tale of an unmanageable pathogen from beyond the Earth.Written as a real documentary report, Crichton manages to impart significant information about Chemical-Bacteriological Warfare, epidemiology, hot zone protocols, computerized patient diagnosis, hemotology, and much else to his readers while still entertaining us.It may be that his supersecret pathogen laboratory, ""Wildfire"" isn't real, but it could be, and so could virtually anything else between these covers, which is why THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN still inspires chills forty years after its publication. The 1971 movieThe Andromeda Strainis a worthy effort, but read the book first."
1,Not a Believer,"Why is Crighton so popular? Why is Andromed Strain so great? I read this book in thirty minutes, because I skimmed through 80% of it. I would rather read a car manual. The climax is drab, the characters blend into each other, and the ""shocking"" scenes are so unexploited, they leave no impression."
1,Ugh,"I was assigned this book to read, and I found it to be very slow and really dull. It starts out allright, drags slowly throughout the middle, and ends entirely wrong."
2,Not that great,Since early about November of last year have been on a Crichton spree of sorts...and i can honestly say this is the worst Crichton novel i have read...the whole book is fairly boring...it is ALOT of scientific talk and not alot of action...but the ending is just not good at all...the ending left me wondering why i read that whole book...it is EXTREMELY anti-climactic...pretty much the only thing that kept this book out of the 1-star range for me was that i liked the idea...read if you want...i just dont like it
5,Crichton's All-Time Best,"I'm never really big on reading for a long time. Usually I'm content to read for about fifteen minutes and do something else. When I do finish a book, it usually takes several months. But then I picked up Michael Crichtons The Andromeda Strain, and I seriously could not put it down for eight full hours. I had things to do that weekend too. I love Crichtons classics such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Airframe, but The Andromeda Strain, without a doubt, his very best work ever. I would recomend this book to anyone without a thought."
3,A well written science fiction novel.,"The Andromeda Strain es aout a microscopic strain that has the ability to kill humans within seconds. A team formerly assembledes brought together in an underground lab to find a cure. I liked how the author described the scientific part ein detail. He used real terms and things to make this novel seem more real. I did not care for the ending. It seemed to end to abrubtly. As if it was wrapped up in a hurry. I do recommend this book, for several reasons. The author, Micheal Crichton, is a very talented writer and this book is an overall well sritten novel. He makes it interesting without much action. The way he brought suspense is completely unique and very clever."
3,OK...,"This book's a really good thriller...until you get to the end. It has a totally crazy ending to it and, in my opinion, needs a little bit of work. I really liked Disclosure better."
1,very cheap,It was broke when I got it I was so mad I bought this for my grandma and it was broke when it arrived to her house.
1,too much filler,"This release absolutely pails in comparison to similar independant releases by hard rock bands like Smash Alley, Loud N' Nasty and Sweet Cheater. Pick up those three bands new releases and you will be a happy eighties rocker. I promise. This cd probably has two or three good songs and the rest is really not the type of hard rock music that their label (Perris) sells them as. I don't see how someone whose favorite music is in the realm of AC/DC or Motley Crue can really like this."
1,Disappointed,"The product was not opened, but it had obviously been damaged at some point the pills had been very roughly handled to the point that they had lost their smooth exterior making them difficult to swallow. If you have difficulty with pills this makes it even more difficult and some individuals might gag on them. A serious disappointment. Caution is advised. Be sure to open this product as soon as you purchase it to insure that it is in the proper condition so that you have an opportunity to take proper actions if it is not in an appropriate condition."
5,A MUST BUY!,"Me and my husband listen to this in our cars as we drove to work daily until we finished it! This is the first CD book I have listened to 3 times and passed on to others! It is absolutely inspiring, life changing if you incorporate the teachings into your daily life. Its not about doing some drastic workbook. Its about reflecting everyday for a few minutes as you drive to work or anyother time of day on ~""CANI"" ~ stands for Constant And Never-ending Improvement. The concept of CANI, improved my married, my career, my friends, my family, EVERYTHING.CANI..... CHANGED MY LIFE.A must buy!"
5,Tony Robbins does it again!,"You can't just listen to it one time! In order to master your life and live it abundantly, this is a CD you need to listen to - and apply - over and over again!"
3,Good Beach Book,"This is a perfect book for the beach. Not too taxing on the brain, and probably forgotten after the last page is turned. A fair mystery, a nice, if predictable, romance.Daisy Minor wants to shake up her life and meet a man. So she dyes her hair, buys a new wardrobe, and Voila she is a new woman. Unfortunately she witnessess a crime, and becomes the target of 'the bad guys'. Relying on the help of the Chief of Police, who just happens to be single and good looking, Daisy helps solve a crime and falls in love (guess who with?)Not as laugh out loud funny as Mr. Perfect, but I still enjoyed it."
2,Sabbatical?,"Has Linda Howard taken a sabbatical and someone else written this book using her name? This book is mediocre at best. It certainly is not up to her standards. This stands as a hastily written, rapidly produced product for profit and certainly not worth reading. Linda, if this is what you are going to start turning out, count me as a former reader."
3,A Good Airplane Read,I actually read this on the plane. It was a fast read. Entertaining but not intellectually stimulating. The characters in the small town were interesting and I enjoyed following their quirky romance. The plot was lacking in intensity and there wasn't much of a mystery. Bottom line: It kept me interested enough for me to try another of her books but not interested enough to pay full price.
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I use to be a big LH fan when she first started out with the romance novels. However, I have not been able to make the transition to her mysteries. I have read about 3 or 4 of them and I can honestly say I have not enjoyed any of them. The last one ""Mr.Perfect"" was so so, but this one was just awful. I say she should just stick to romance and leave the mystery to Nora Roberts. The plot was extremely weak and I did not find any chemistry with the two main characters. Save your money and pass on this book. ..."
3,JUST DIDN'T LIKE IT,"I somehow managed to get through this book - only because I hate not finishing something I have started. But the book, which started out to be mildly entertaining, turned silly and dull rather quickly. The romance between Daisy and Jack was a little improbable, but it didn't bother me. I just found that there wasn't much plot to hold my interest.The ending too was unbelievable and senseless. Without revealing too much, the book seems to suggest that someone who had been a murderer throughout the book would somehow prove to be the ""savior"" of one of the other characters at the end! Outrageously ridiculous! And it actually made me angry.I think this will be my first and last Linda Howard novel. (Actually, I vaguely remember starting Mr. Perfect and reading a little before stopping and getting bored. I guess she really isn't my cup of tea, is she?)"
5,I've read it and read it and read it... it's still the best ever!,"Linda Howard shines in ""Open Season"". This book sits proudly on my keeper shelf and every once in a while I pull it down and read it all over again. And every time, I end up laughing as if it were my first time reading it. I love the sensuality. I love the humor. Daisy and Jack are so perfect together, I swear I can so easily see this couple walking down Main St. Holding hands, Daisy laughing while Jack whispers naughty suggestions in her ear. I feel like I know these two characters personally. Yeah, it's that good! Read it and see for yourself... I dare ya!"
5,OPEN SEASON,"LORD HAVE MERCY THIS WOMAN CAN WRITE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HER AGE. BECUASE THE SELFISH SIDE OF ME DOESN'T WANT HER TO EVER DIE SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO WITHOUT HER BOOKS. IF YOU READ LINDA HOWARD, THIS WAS ANOTHER HIT. DO NOT MISS IT."
4,"Not one of her best, but an okay read!","After reading ""Mr. Perfect"" not to long ago, I was alittle disappointed in ""Open Season"". This book could have been better, I thought the plot was alittle shallow and kind of silly. The romance between Daisy and the town Sheriff keeps you laughing and the love scenes are well....I won't go there! If Ms. Howard would have stayed with the girl in the first chapter of the book, this would have been a much better book, I was very interested in her story more than Daisy's. I gave this book four stars for the romance and the funny part concerning condoms, this is one of the funniest things I think I have ever read! What can I say, Read and judge for yourself!"
4,I liked this story!,"I was expecting, like other readers, more suspense, violence, gorry details. What I got was a good love story with a slight detective angle to it. I put this book on the list of one of my favorites because I like to see relationships grow, know more of the characters and less blow by blow violence. Daisy and Jack are good together, as are all of the secondary players in the book. Sleepy little town, nothing changes, then the main characters take over and wham! A very good read and I recommend to all."
2,Great Idea,"This was a great idea and I bought it for a road trip with the kids last summer. We enjoyed parts of it. But most of it, unless you know every single song by heart, is hard to follow. It would be nice to have the singers singing back up through more of the songs, or at least have better intrances cues. I am fairly comfortable with music and singing with my kids, but I have never learned 'Cielita Linda' well enough to sing it with only the words.All in all, not worth the money for me, though my kids do love the drum solo song where all they have to do is bang on stuff to a cool beat."
2,Not to sprout with Water,"I did not know until I tried, but these seeds do not sprout with water. I guess they need soil. So I wasted my money on a useless producct."
5,Very good book!,"The Condor Passes...The ruthless accumulation, the spending, and the ultimate disposition of a great New Orleans fortune furnish the motive force in Grau's huge, brilliant novel of three American generations whose lives are caught up in and shaped by the currents of money and power."
3,Thumbs up for style,"I found this book lacking the historic sweep and richness of Ms. Grau's Keepers of the House - which completely took me in - though it certainly sweeps the downside of some rich New Orleans characters' lives! I never was invested in what happened to the characters, except for the child. Beautifully written, but not going on my list of favorites.I will be reading some of this author's other works, with expectations still high."
3,"What I thought of ""Herding Dogs""","Was a good book, if your into border collies and sheep trials. They make the book out to be a manual for all types of herding. All it really told about was sheep herding and told little about working cattle, and the author compared everything to border collies."
5,Easy to read...definitely a challenging book,This book is written in a very easy format. I think even a child could understand the precepts laid forth in this book! I would definitely recommend.
3,Pretty Good,"I expected betterfrom the Outlawz from 2pac tracks like hit 'em up, bit they still did well on their long-awaited debut. Their, second album, Novakane, should be better and I reccomend pickin that up."
1,Does it come with crayons??,"I couldn't help it, when I heard Tim McGraw had a book published I had to laugh, and laugh hard. Yes ol' Timmy's doing pretty good for himself. His CMT sheep will buy whatever they are lead to. Tim doesn't write songs or play an instrument, so I doubt he had anything to do with this book. Much like Gene Simmons, he'll sell himself out with whatever junk producers decide to put his face on. He'll sit back and laugh at how a talentless man became a celebrity in America. Only in America."
1,Broke the first time I used it,The item broke the very first time I used it. The wood cracked and the whole thing seemed cheaply built.
5,Love my boot jack,Taking off my boots has never been easier! I wear my boots even more now since they are so easy to take off.
2,Yoke Broke...,"Initially, a great product. I bought one from my local boot repair shop, and it worked like magic when I wanted to remove one particular pair of dress boots I own that were previously impossible to get off without frustration and working up a serious sweat.However, after several uses, the wood on one side of the yoke on this product snapped off, rendering it unusable until I drove it back on with a few screws. Unless you feel like jury-rigging this cheaply made boot jack to endure stress, I'd recommend a more solid and expensive one."
3,Combat details derailed by naive political commentary,"Rosenkranz provides plenty of details about exactly what a combat pilot does in a very busy F-16 cockpit, and he also details some of the interesting personal history that led him into this career. Unfortunately, he can't resist frequently venturing off into naive political and historical analyses of the wider questions of the war and the threat Iraq posed to the world, reprinting many speech excerpts from President H.W. Bush as justification for what he and his fellow service men and women were doing, extending them, in the end, to justify the current war in Iraq without ever considering the problems incurred by pursuing policy with force in the Middle East. At times the book reads like an instrument of the Republican National Committee campaign to reelect George W. Bush, or at the very least an apologist for the mistakes of both Bush administrations in the Middle East."
3,"NOT A GREAT EVENT, ATALL","WWWs third event held in England in the space of a year and a half, was a letdown.No where near as good as Capital Carniage.Held in Manchester in front of a sellout house, the card never was gonna be a good one.Pitting two no hopers of Gilberg vs Tiger Ali Singh was a joke.No belts changed, and basically the wrestling was rather poor. No rock, Big show, Alsnow, Shamrock, and many other superstars were there. The 2 Good matches were shane vs x punk and mr ass vs mankind.The main event was the usual crap, Austin stuns everyone and then shares some beers.Not great atall."
3,'06 F-150 BAR STYLE GRILL,"buyers, listen up! The grille insert in the picture is not the same as what you'll get. I bought this product for my xlt f-150 because amazon said it would fit. I didn't see the small print, because doing alot of research on the product tends to make your senses a little more careless, where the actual seller has it's own product fitment link. Make sure you check that out because for some reason they have the full honeycomb style grille picture as to what is being sold and in reality, you're getting a different looking product that is cut to fit the bar style grilles commonly found on the fx4 model f150. That version of the inferno look is not the same as what's shown in the pictures for this product so make sure you're getting what you want before you buy it. I returned it immediately and bought the correct model for my xlt which is PUTCO 89142 made to fit the full honeycomb grille. Other than that, I love putco products and I recommend them."
5,"Move over, Agatha Cristie","This series is engaging, funny, and quite believable. Montalbano is a principled police inspector in Sicily who solves murder mysteries with his brain rather than guns. In the process, the Sicilian scenery, culture and language (including typical communication by hands and facial expressions) raise the stories to a level higher than most mysteries. The subtitles are well done in the movies and easy to follow. The books upon which the movies are based are also an excellent read, with superb translations."
4,Only one star away from perfect!,"I've read all the books with much pleasure. These films are a faithful representation. I found the production values very good. The actors are well cast, in my opinion, and the stories are engaging, funny, sad, and mysterious. What more could one ask? Dubbing...for those of us whose Italian is rudimentary and who find subtitles challenging."
5,Any Day Of The Week,"Jimmy Buffett has built up such a personal fortune, that it allows him to record and tour at his own pace. He has cut down his touring schedule to where he only plays on Tuesdays, Thursdays & Saturdays, thus the album's title. Despite the trimmed down touring schedule, Mr. Buffett has lost nothing off his fastball as this live album will attest to. He can rip it up, slow it down and drive the crowd into a frenzy as well as he ever could. The album pulls out some welcomed chestnuts like ""Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season"", ""Coconut Telegraph"" & ""Pencil Thin Mustache"" as well as a version of ""Margaritaville"" with a lost verse. He breaths new life into old warhorses like ""Son Of A Son Of A Sailor"" and ""Cheeseburger In Paradise"" and does a superb cover of Crosby, Stills & Nash's ""Southern Cross"". ""One Particular Harbor"" & ""Love & Luck"" are both bring the house down numbers. Parrotheads rejoice as Jimmy Buffett is still king."
3,"Same songs, more $$","Having been a Parrothead since '74, I have heard Jimmy evolve from very creative to rather self-indulged. Beachhouse is a primary example. Most of the lyrics on that are all about him and his satisfaction with his life. The album is a little too smooth.I don't have to listen to the current album to know that it is another rehash of my old favorites of the last 25 years. Brown-eyed girl was covered by Jimmy years ago.Having said all that, I will always listen to Jimmy, and I don't care about his vocal range. As a long time sailor, his music represents the dream for many sailors of living the island life, no matter how idealized."
2,Poor vocals and song selection,"There are a few highlights on Tu, Th, and Sat. Tin Cup Chalice, Cocunut Telegraph, and Fins. As others have said before, the song selection is very similar to Feeding Frenzy. Where's Changes in Latitudes (Changes in Latitudes)? What about putting Havana Daydreaming and Manana in there? Why must Volcano be on there?The vocals are pretty painful on some songs. Particularly Southern Cross, which I don't like the version on there. I could also do without Brown Eyed Girl. Tryin' To Reason With Hurricane Season is too slow.I like some other people's ideas of doing box set live album with the hits, obscure old stuff, and an acoustic set. That would've been great. If you want live Buffett, opt for Feeding Frenzy. Versions and vocals are better on there."
2,Buffitt Live:...,"Comon Jim. If you've burned out, take that cruise, compose, and give us another "" Bannana Wind"". This CD is nothing but a rehash of old songs that we already have. You're marketing people are hurting you. I'll save my $15 on this one. Sorry."
5,Just like being there,I saw Jimmy in concert for the first time this summer. This album is just like being there. One of his best yet.. Southern Cross never sounded better.
3,KATA sensitivity review,It is indeed a innovative design from Kata. Everything is fine except the size. It would be better if it was bigger and could carry the tripod as well.
3,limited usefulness,"While well-made, the bag's architecture is limiting. Fully loaded with camera, lenses, laptop, and the usual accessories, the bag rides rather awkwardly on my back. The straps are clumsy and the strap pockets too tight and slender to hold a phone or nano. The bag's ""look,"" on the other hand is ""cool"" to say the least. Also, the bright yellow interior is very nice. I've given the bag away and am back to using my Lowepro ""micro trekker"" 200 backpack, which lacks a laptop compartment and pings the dork meters of even the most unapologetic of nerds, but rides more comfortably, even with my tripod."
2,Not entirely as advertised...,"The curtains are satiny, they are very lightweight- those are true. The full product description says ""Each square piece measures 84 by 84 inches..."".The actual fact is, EACH panel measures 42 x 84. I purchased 2 pair for my 90yr Grandmother, whom is very dissapointed at this time. Because of the very misleading description, I must now purchase 2 more pair because they are so scimpy."
3,Enough ..Misinformation about Genetic Reseaarch,"I had difficulty taking this book seriously. It seems as though the author has misinterpreted the findings of genetic research. As a result, he doesn't present the whole story. His fears are unfounded. Scientists know full well that life is not governed by genetic specifications. The psychological processes he discusses, such as music ability and intelligence, are influenced by many factors such as upbringing, life experiences, culture, cohort and education. Even in the late seventies, when I went to college, researchers accepted the premise that human traits ..especially psychological ones ..are brought about by the interaction of our genetic nature with our life experiences. Human development is a constant exchange between nature and the socializing influences of family and culture. To think that it is unilaterally determined by genetic makeup is fallacious."
3,"Damas gratis, Pibes Chorros","El 2x1 Damas Gratis y Pibes Chorros CD no está tan bueno. Las primeras 3 canciones de los Pibes Chorros: ""Embarrada y Sucia, Volve, Queremos más Perreo"" son buenas. Las demás como: Andrea, La Lechera, Duraznito etc. son en vivo y no se entiende lo que cantan. La calidad de sonido de estas canciones, canciones 4-12, es muy mala. Las canciones de Damas Gratis, canciones 13-22, son muy buenas porque no son en vivo. Sería más lógico y recomendable comprar Operación Damas Gratis CD y Pibes Chorros Discografía Completa Vol. 1 que comprar el 2x1 Damas Gratis Y Pibes Chorros. Sería una mejor compra, sin dudas."
4,"Helpful, funny, and accurate!","What i first did when i received the book was read the chapter about my home-country, who wouldn't have? And i found it quite accurate (both in positive and not so positive aspects of my culture). Then i read the US chapter, again, quite accurate. I read four or five countries i know well (i either lived or worked there) and i must admit i was impressed.This book is EASY TO READ, ENTERTAINING, FUNNY AT TIMES and last but not least ACCURATE!"
4,Very useful,Well composed and useful book for those traveling abroad as well for seeking additional knowledge on the cultural experiences of different countries.
4,A resource for me,"Written for the international business traveler, this book was a great resource for me as characters in the Marketplace novels came from around the world. For my fans who keep asking me for ""the protocol:"" hey, start here and you tell me."
4,"The Seekers , Kindle version","This is a good novel, and typical of John Jakes can be a little dark here and there, and alludes to famous aAmericans that actually existed. I gues this is semi factual."
3,is that the end,"What happened the book overall was good, but boy was I disappointed by the end. I felt that Ms Delinsky got tired and wanted to wrap up the story, The ending will make you wonder whatdid the ballatine files contained, did sabrina have a girl or boy and what about the antagonist Geer did he get his in the end.I've read several of Ms.Delinsy's books and this was about to be my favorite if not for the end, she left so many potenial story lines loose and I felt cheated out of a potential good book"
1,Rate changes too costly,This was a nice little scale until the postal rates went up. It then took research to find that the processor chip had to be replaced at a cost greater than the scale. I just use it for the weighing function and calculate the postage myself.
2,ma-ma = so-so,"This product came as advertised, but just wasn't what I needed. Too small, must plug in, and, as I soon learned goes out of date quickly. The chip to update the scale costs more than the scale itself, of course. In the end, I returned this for the more flexible Ultra-35, Ultra-Ship model which has worked flawlessly thus far. Nice also to be able to weigh in a multitude of measurements such as grams, kilograms, ounces, pounds etc. The USPS scale is only pounds and ounces. I really like the battery option of the Ultra 35 as well as you can move it anywhere and weigh the package quickly. For users who want to keep it in a fixed location, the Ultra 35 can also be plugged in with the included adapter."
2,Too complicated for daily use.,Too many settings and this scale needs to be plugged into the wall. It can NOT run on a 9 volt battery.
5,great series A-H,"As a teacher and a dad, I have found that this series is a great way to teach vocabulary and is a great way to learn. Words have the pronunciation(which is also online in audio form), great definitions/synonyms/antonyms, and great exersises. There is a review every 3 chapters in each book and a review/test at the end of it too. Each book has about 12 chapters with 20 words to learn. Great to do weekly. As a teacher I would advise testing weekly 10 of the 20 words with spelling, meaning and using them in a sentence. I would then give them 5 additional words from any earlier chapter to keep them reviewing. These books are great. My students (from 6th-11th grade) all love them. After a few chapters students will comment how they can understand more when they read. It is also very cool to hear your kids learning these words in their daily lives."
3,Good Tesla Review but NOT for Project Haarp,"Lots of info about Tesla's work in the USA. Only 10 pages about Project Haarp and cold war technology. Should have been titled ""Secrets of Tesla's Radiant Energy research"". And too much space on Tesla's disagreement with Marconi's inferior waves."
3,"More Techno, less Funk","I bought this without hearing enough of it and was expecting a different sound, like the light techno/funk you hear in Europe. This is anthem style, throbbing British and American sounding Techno. Somewhat Industrial since he's from Chicago. Ignore the word Funk."
4,"Pseudonyms, Pseudonyms, Pseudonyms","The book is a great source of information. It could be a ""must have"" for any genealogist, amateur or professional. The extensive use of pseudonyms detracts from the importance of the sample documentation given. I could barely get through reading the numerous sample documents or reports from Traditional Storey to Ima Goodresearcher! I would recommend using real names and not ficticious ones in the next edition."
3,Can you explain why it takes 1-3 months to receive?,"I ordered this book but now I understand it will take 1-3 months to arrive. What's the deal? It's not like they are taking special orders or something, or custom making each volume for each researcher. Gimme a break. If you don't have it, don't make me read the fine print--let me know up front."
3,the music DOES speak louder than the words,"The good news is that when this record is good, it's GREAT. The bad news is that when it's not good, it's really, really not good. With six cuts of Ornette Coleman covers and a truly great set of side musicians, this could have been a near-perfect recording (definitely 5 stars). Unfortunately, Ulmer includes three originals of sung r&b songs (these aren't terrible songs, it's just that Ulmer's lyrics and singing can't begin to compete with his own incredible guitar playing). On the instrumentals, Ulmer's harmolodic playing has never been better, especially on the opening cut ""Lonely Woman."" Ironically, the title of the recording might have informed Ulmer (let the music speak for you man, it says so much more than your words). The definitive Ulmer record is still ""Tales of Captain Black,"" and if you can afford the import $, it comes more highly recommended."
3,Karate Bearfighter,Was wrong DVD I received at the beggining than after contacting and sending back the wrong DVD received the correct one.Satisfy service.Thanks
2,Meteor shower--take evasive action,"""Zathura"" is about two brothers that fight all the time. The younger brother finds a sci-fi board game called ""Zathura"" in the basement, and wants his bratty older brother to play with him. The older brother is less than excited about playing a board game, but quickly comes around when a meteor shower happens in the living room.""Zathura"" is basically Jumanji in space...but without the good story. The effects are top-notch, but the story isn't. We've seen this movie before, and we don't need to see a second-rate remake."
2,Boreing,For the life of me I cannot understand how any one could like this deplorable and stupid film. I was totally bored who wrote the script for this film? A load of codswollop.
4,zathura a fun movie,"zathura is a fun movie to watch, it does have a good lesson in it plus it has some good special effects"
5,Zathura,We have watched this movie over and over. This movie is a wonderful fantasy movie for all ages and well worth the price.....
2,Vulgarity and Profanity ruin a potentially good family movie,Once again Hollywood has chosen to ruin a potentially good family/childrens movie by including foul vulgar language. How some can label this as a good family movie is beyond me. I have higher standards and values for my family I guess. Yes this is suppose to be a Jumanji sequel but unfortunately Zathura was made in todays society where the norms of lewd vulgar and profanity are being accepted as healthy family values. This society is sicko.
3,Product composition,"Though this is very nice and sturdy, I assumed it to be metal like a similar one I have...it is not, it is some kind of plastic resin."
3,Good for lite recreation,"I bought a fleece mask like this one from icanbreath.com . It works well for lite exercise like walking in cold weather, but not for running because the air does not flow freely enough and I found myself fighting the mask to get in air."
1,Worst Media ever,"Plays fine on the first layer. But picture will freeze during layer switch. I either have to stop or skip pass the chapter but picture will be jumping and pixellated, pretty much unwatchable.you have to skip at least couple chapter away from the layer switch to get a decent picture on your screen.don't waste your money. Buy verbatim instead. I never had any problem with that media."
2,You get what you pay for. Low cost = lower functionality,"It is certainly warm enough although the mesh opening around the mouth allows a fair amount of wind chill to the lips. The down vent over the nose is not formed so it allows the escaping breath to rise and fog glasses/goggles. The velcro closure is bunched and is somewhat difficult to align and seal. It is fairly tight, if you have a large head like me, and that also makes it a little difficult to adjust. It took weeks for me to gt this item as it did not ship on the date promised from the manufacturer. If you are looking for high functionality and to get a balaclava in a hurry you should look at one of the more expensive options."
