3,Turns off,"I bought this for my Dad for christmas and he is mostly happy with it. However, the warmer does not stay on. He likes to wander the house and come back and get coffee, but he has to continually turn it back on."
5,My husband liked it - was a christmas gift,"It does exactly what it claims to do. Makes coffee and is simple to use. We havent yet used to pause or timer feature, but it shows correct time since the day we got it set up."
3,Works Great but NOT 4 cups,"I've been using this for more than a year and am very satisfied with the performance. However, it is NOT 4 cups. In Mr.Coffee language, a cup is 5 ounces (!!). This means the machine suffices for a little more than one large mug of coffee. Since I'm always making coffee for one person at a time this is fine, but if I was making for more people I would have been pretty angry at Mr.Coffee for making up their own definition of the Cup. Deducting 2 stars for deception!"
2,Dribble Pot,"The coffee maker itself works fine. Brews pretty quick. BUT!!!! The damn ""decanter"", pot, whatever... DRIBBLES every time you pour!!! When i fill the back with the decanter- it dribbles water all over the counter. When i pour out the first 2 cups of coffee- it dribbles coffee all over the counter. It's doubled my paper towel consumption!!! Tried everything- lifting the lid to pour, pouring slowly, pouring quickly etc. Haven't tried running it over with the car yet."
5,Good size,"This coffee pot is a great size for anyone who is just looking to make good old fashioned coffee for one or two people each day, but doesn't want to spend a fortune on a fancy $100 single serve maker."
3,"Works Fine, a few issues","This coffee maker works fine as such. It is a little louder than I expected, not really sure why.Due to the placement of the lid, it is difficult to pour in water without it getting into the grounds.The main issue I've had is when trying to use the delay brew setting.The button to change the time has to be held while setting the time for the brewing to start. Unfortunately, the button is small enough that it is hard to be sure you are actually holding it. If you are not holding it down, the clock itself changes. It's something you have to watch for, since I've had the coffee maker start an hour early before, because the time was off."
5,Excellent Coffee! Great Value!,"After shopping to make a selection,I read reviews on Amazon (My favorite store!). I then made my purchase.I posessed more knowledge then I would have received in any brick & mortar store. My prime membership once again was .well worth it. I enjoyed a great cup of coffee within 48 hours of my purchase!"
3,Good for the price.,The 4 cup size is perfect for me. The only complaint is that the PAUSE element does not work.
3,Defective clock,I set the clock various times only to have it not keep the correct time. Clock runs too slow so I can't use the delay brew. Didn't bother sending it back. Just set it up the night before and hit brew in the morning.
3,Much smaller than I thought!,"I just purchased this machine and am sending it back unused so I can't fairly rate it.My complaint is when I read ""4 cup coffee maker"" I assumed that meant 32 ounces. This is NOT. The carafe held 24 ounces of water (very full) when I tested it. That is much smaller than the 2 to-go cups my husband and I walk out the door with, and really, what's the point of leaving the house with a 1/2 cup of coffee?I was excited about it, it's just way too tiny. Would like some clarification that the ""cups"" that they are talking about are not actual 8 ounce cups."
2,Failed to work after 6 weeks,"This machine worked very well until the day it didn't, which was only six weeks after I bought it. The clock kept working, but the machine itself didn't turn on.Very disappointing because before that, it made a good cup of coffee."
3,"Works well, but TINY","This is a nice coffee-maker for the price, but don't expect to be able to fill more than a travel mug and part of another. I got this for my son and I to have coffee ready-made before we head off to work, but I had to run a second batch to fill our mugs (which are not the big ones, pretty much standard size)."
3,Mr. Coffee 4 cup programmable coffee maker,"[[ASIN:B0008JIW8U Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, BlackThis device turns off after one hour which I think is a definite disadvantage. This period of time should be left to the choice of the user."
5,Great little coffee maker,"Bought this Mr. Coffee 4-cup coffeemaker for my husband for Father's Day. I drink Decaf and he likes regular coffee. It works great. Haven't had a single problem with it. It really only makes about 2 mugs of coffee, but that's all he drinks a day anyway. When I need to replace my 12 cup coffee maker, I'll buy a Mr. Coffee instead of my much more expensive Kitchen-Aid."
3,it was okay but...,"it worked well before. But now it's broken. I have already contacted with Mr. coffee, still wait for their response."
2,This is not the 2nd TOUCH Album!,"This is a big switch for a great progressive, well the first progressive band TOUCH. With three members, and Don on keys one song. This is nothing like TOUCH. More mainline rock. No new ground broken here. It does have a couple of 3 star songs. Jimmy Greenspoon from Three Dog Night plays also. This CD is VERY pricy for what you get."
3,Something to rent eagerly on a Tuesday night.,"I really can't recommend this purchase for anyone other than as a mild adrenaline rush. The animation is uneven and attends mediocrity at times which is unfortunate because the underlying story is pretty entertaining. The tale revolves around a ruthless warlord that is somehow using advanced weapons to overthrow his opponents and has enlisted the powers of the notorious ninja killer, the immortal Gennai Doma. A crack team of ninjas is charged with the seemingly impossible task of assasinating Gennai. It's not the best anime by far, but nor is it the worst. However, that's not saying much. Had the animators pursued the final product more vigorously they could have come up with something rather good."
4,"Not great, but very entertaining...","The story is OK, the animation is fair but there is a lot of action and it is nice and bloody."
4,This Book was well received as a gift!,Read thru a portion to see if it would interest the intended party and was very surprised! Excellent info and well written!
1,Not What I Expected,This a product that is not what I expected since i've used braun before. It takes awhile to get most my beard. I now have to buy another one just to get a better shave.
3,"Kauai, Hawaii DVD","Good review of the island of Kauai. Shows a variety of places, gives a breif history."
2,"Cheap, both in quality and price","This product for $10 by amazon is very cheap. However when I received it, i could already tell there'd be a problem with it. The side with the suction cups has no plastic wall. You're depending on the aquarium glass, and faith that the device wont move, so that your bettas dont get out. I've place four bettas in this and have had problems in the first week with bettas placed on the sides, getting out. Luckily none of the bettas escape all together, however raising cichlids, my bettas have been quite harassed when they've gotten out of their home. It is a neat toy, and for its price I'd rather keep it then deal with the shipping costs of returning the item."
5,"Excellent read, couldn't put it down!","Like most male teenagers, Logan comes very close many times to going over the edge where some stupid teenage decision could completely change the direction of your life, usually for the worse. The book was impossible to put down until I knew exactly what happened to him as he went from teenager to adult. A great story; very believable, with excelent detail and imagery."
2,Hard to put in place,The spice rack looks nice. Won't know the quality until I can use it and see how much weight it will take. I had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet. It is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me. The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws. Very awkward to use the screws. Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws. I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits. Now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible. I wouldn't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet. Took much too much time to get it into place.
4,handy,"we use it to store vitamins/pills. very handy convienent, out of way and out of sun. matches decor nicely and easy to install."
1,Burnout on Disko,"The Griffin Disko case is very cute, but the slightest movement activates the lights, which burns through the batteries in only a day or two. The case is very difficult to remove once it is on to allow for charging time. I was very disappointed for the price."
3,Sent wrong colour,"The colours of the wallet that was actually sent to me did not match those online. Grey does not equal Green. I called and customer service was very nice, but they were confused because the description that I gave them (Barcode wise) was exactly the same for what I supposedly ordered. Overall, what they sent was not what I wanted and so I had to return the item."
1,Hot alien love does not a good movie make...,"The Species trilogy is arguably one of the worst franchises ever. The films all follow the exact same premise: there's an ultra-hot alien babe with a sex drive that would put rabbits to shame, and she's running around trying to screw every man she meets. You have to wonder what lonely pizza-faced eighth-grader came up with this garbage, or what pot-smoking Hollywood big-shot decided that it should be done another two times. Actually, Species 3 isn't completely horrible. The main character in that one is slightly interesting, and the movie's emphasis is much less on the hot alien sex."
3,Pleated Shade,"The shade is much like the picture. Quality is adequate. However, the spider is chrome, not that matching to the brass lamp it sits on. The price was OK, but there was no bargain here. It is an average shade, and an average price."
5,Architectural Record says:,"""An important work that defines the tenets of New Urbanism, this book serves as the group's manifesto. The charter illustrates the 27 principles of New Urbanism, from the scale of regions to neighborhoods and buildings, and pairs each with an essay by a different author. Now followers of the movement can use the charter to define their work and detractors can refer to it when presenting their side of the debate. ... Graphically pleasing, the book reads well ... When defining the problems of today's development patterns, the text is clear and seductive. ... The test of the Charter of New Urbanism will be its timeless quality. ..."""
2,THIS IS NOT PURE OIL!!!,Misleading listing. The bottle contains only 1 (one!!) percent of oil suspended in alcohol. I expected pure rose extract. Dishonest description.
3,Hard to follow,"The Saving Graces"" was a nice story about the lives of four longtime friends. The bond that holds these women together is enviable and their heartaches are things we all can relate to. What I didn't like at all is the format of the book. Each chapter is written from each friend's point of view. It bounces back and forth from Emma, Lee, Isabel, and Rudy, the only titles for all the chapters. You'll be reading each event from a different point of view. While this gives you insights into each character, it is extremely hard to follow and you end up not really knowing who is experiencing what. I don't think it worked well and I found myself re-reading chapters past to see who was saying what and why. There wasn't any flow at all. It certainly wasn't a book that draws you in because you can't get far enough into without the feeling someone just switched the channel."
4,A great book about female friendship........,"I had the pleasure of reading this book a couple of months ago and I must say that it is one of the best books that I have read in about a year!! The author is able to make you get inside of each of the characters and really feel what they are feeling. I have read many books in my 39 years, and not since reading The Bridges of Madison County have I actually cried while reading a novel. If you haven't read this one yet, do go out and get it, you won't regret it."
4,"Nominate Me, Graces!","Ah, to be a part of their group would be profoundly sweet.... The power of friendship over time, the beauty of loving support and individuality within the bounds of differences, disagreements, breakdowns, break ups and come togethers is the heart of ""The Saving Graces"".It is rare for me to appreciate each character of a book like I do in this one. I have to admit a tendency to like Emma the best only because, like me, she is a writer.Gaffney captures the essence of long-term friendship between women. The text is easy and enjoyable to read. It made me think without being heavy, brought me emotionally into the story without exhausting me.Perfect read for someone on hiatus from ""deep thinking"" forms of writing without being too schmaltzy or completely predictable."
4,Friendship is Grand,"A little confusing at first. but good once you get going......Females will identify with at least one of the women....I laughed, i cried.....but in the end friends remain true to each other"
1,Yawwwwn,"What a bore. After 150 pages and trying my best to like it, I put it down and returned it to a friend who truly loved it. It wasn't entertaining, the characters were sappy, just not my kind of book."
1,Meh,I read this book for a book club and found it a vacuous attempt at profundity. Unless the author's secret objective was to force us to look at the utter banal and shallowness of the modern woman's plight (a missed opportunity in my opinion) it was simply banal and shallow and nothing more. Save yourself some time and money and simply watch an hour of Lifetime TV instead.
5,A wonderful tale of sisterly-love,"What made this book truly great was the depth of the friendship between these four women. It was written so well, that I was achining for a friend like Isabel for several days after I had finished the book."
4,I wish I had friends like these!,This book was enjoyable. I was able to relate to each of the characters and to each of their adversities. I enjoyed reading about their friendship and how it evolved over time and how each person played a vital role. I think this is a great book!
5,Saving Graces,"I just finished reading this book. It was so good, I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was one of the ""Graces"". I felt so close to all of them. I feel empty now that I've finished the book -- like I've lost 4 best friends. I recommend it to every woman."
3,The Saving Graces,"A novel about 4 women who meet for dinner and support over the years, this book attempts to recount the story in each of their voices. Unlike The Poisonwood Bible, another summer release which manages this difficult literary trick artfully, The Saving Graces never quite finds the womens' personalities.An easy read for the beach or plane."
3,"Sadly, not my favorite","Banana Yoshimoto's Kitchen is one of my favorite books, and Asleep was great also, but Amrita is not one that I would recommend for anyone just testing the Banana Yoshimoto waters. The theme of the book is fine, and the style is the familiar Yoshimoto sweet, full of emotion, sometimes of supernatural-feeling style, but overall this book was a bit strange and wandering. I think it needed a huge edit to really achieve the story that she wanted.If you just have to read everything by Banana Yoshimoto, then I would read this one also, but if you don't have time to read everything in the world, then I would skip this one and move on to Haruki Murakami, another wonderful Japanese author with an other-worldly feel to his writing. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Wild Sheep Chase are really neat."
5,This is an outstanding book.,"Heartsounds is, quite simply, the best nonfiction book I have read in my life. Not a phoney word, each thought a moving testimonial to the human spirit. At the same time, highly realistic."
4,Good basic information,"I am not the parent of a child with bipolar disorder, so I cannot comment on how useful this book is for parents trying to help a bipolar child. However, as a general reader, I found this book to have good basic information. It was easy to read, not at all too technical for the non medically trained person. In fact, I thought that at times the author could have gone into more detail on particular topics.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for easy to read, entry-level info on pediatric bipolar disorder."
5,Now this is a good horror movie,"Finally something a bit novel....even the name of the ""product"". Human flesh being called ""long pigs""...pretty cool......as was the movie. Very entertaining for horror afficionados. I highly recommend this movie"
4,50 Fabulous Places to Retire,"This book is a little dated, but it seems to be the most current available on the subject. The RetirementInsider website has many more communities and more current information."
3,Pretty good but not my favorite,"I have a number of Tae Bo workout videos from Billy. This one was definitely different, not bad, and it definitely has some funky moves I haven't seen before so if you are looking for a change in routine this might be for you. My favorite Cardio workout from Billy isBilly Blanks' Tae-Bo Cardio. Some people may find that too tame but I love it beacuse it has a great warm-up a great cool-down and less jumping. Its more of a steady pace that works better for me since I hit my 50s."
4,Excellent Household Blender,"Bought this blender to help with the holiday cooking and it performed flawlessly. From puddings to smoothies, I had no problems.As good as this blender is, I wouldn't recommend it for constant heavy use. The motor heats up under heavy use and I suspect it could easily fail."
2,Book condition,"""I paid too much for a book that was wrinkled, torn and overall in bad shape. They shouldn't put ""GOOD"" besides book condition,if the book has torn pages. I bought books from other sellers that were in better condition than this. Not at all satisfied."""
1,Not the real thing,"The book I was sent was not bound, but punched with holes to fit into a 3ring binder. This was not mentioned in the description of the book I ordered, and was disappointing. I will not order from this vendor again"
5,The best product for canker sores. Period.,"Since I was in my mid-20s, every time I break through the skin on my lips or cheek, I get a canker. A big, painful canker. This is the only product (and I have tried them all) that can take a 10 day ordeal into a 4 day healing. Unlike most products that just mask the pain, this also promotes healing by preventing repetitive injury due to normal moving of the mouth while drinking, eating or talking."
3,A mixed bag,"I was given this book for Christmas and really looked forward to reading it, having always been a Paul fan. I found it a mixed bag of a book. The details of Paul and John's early life and career and Paul's time with Jane Asher's family were really good, but the book fell down by being far too detailed on EVERY chord of every song. There was no analysis by Miles of Paul's statements, and it ended up by showing Paul to think a great deal of himself, and not much of other people. What happened to him post-Beatles? This was summed up in 1 chapter, no mention of being in jail, the Northern Songs take-over or of his career. It only goes to show that he was nothing without the other Beatles. A book that was good in parts."
3,The girl Hunters,"Although Mickey Spillane's acting is terrible, the film has a certain reality about it. After all to actually see Spillane portraying his famous character is great. The film is shot in a very realistic home movie fashion. Clearly not an oscar candidate, yet it has a rare quality. I think it is the honest nature of this film that is captivating to watch. It is truely a must for any Mike Hammer/Spillane fan. I never tire of seeing it!"
3,worthy spillane performance; killer ending,"Mickey Spillane plays his own Mike Hammer in this otherwiseunspectacular noir mystery. Although it does have a pretzel stick ofa plot somewhere in there, nothing much really happens. The film lives and dies on Spillane's stonefaced, scene-chewing performance. Don't miss the ending. Good-looking dvd presentation, presented in extremely full scope."
1,Disappointing,"I read pro and con reviews about the suction grab bar and decided to take a chance. My mother was coming to visit, and I needed a safety solution for the bathroom, and I needed it quickly. This was not it. The bar would not stick to the fiberglass shower surround or the smooth, painted wall. I took it around the house to see what it would stick to. Glass or the metal front door were the only successes. This will go back. It's the sort of thing that should work but just doesn't."
5,Wonderful,Colleen Coble is a wonderful author and her stories come to life. I loved this book. I found myself wishing that I lived in the same town and place as Tatiana and Gabe. I loved the ending of this book and I cant wait to read another book by this author.
3,"Pretty good, but...","The 2001 is better in My Opinion, 2001 has better/more skateparks/screwing around, although there are more skaters in this one, not as much skating. A must have to complete the series though, this was the last one they made :(-Leo"
5,A typically wonderful TY product,"These Beanie Baby products never cease to delight and the German Bear is no exception.Whether on his own, or part of a den of bears, this is wonderful."
5,"""The Boys on the Tracks"" - Reality in Arkansas","Readers outside of Arkansas might have a hard time believing that the events this book describes actually happened. Unfortunately, they did, as those of us who live here know. Although Leveritt works for a competing paper, the statewide Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reviewed ""The Boys on the Tracks"" at length. The review did not challenge any of the author's facts. Rather, it said the account was ""eye-opening"" and described the book as ""staightforward, engaging and extensively researched."" The review also said the book ""reads like a psychological thriller,"" and that it ""lures you in and holds you hostage."" I pass this on so that readers who are not familiar with the caliber of Leveritt's reporting will feel confident about ordering the book. You won't be disappointed."
4,Book 1 of the Flower Shop Mysteries,"In Book 1, Abby deals with some cut-rate competition. When her beloved vintage yellow 'Vette gets smashed in a hit-and-run, Abby is determined to find out who is responsible (a girl can't live without her car, right?) Unfortunately, she steps on some toes .. and her next questions may be her last ..."
2,Dies on the vine.,"this started out as a fun, imaginative read. But it became tedious and went on far too long. The author has a clever story line, but needs to edit out some sequences."
2,"Beautiful, but dull, ultimately disappointing.","It's terrible to see something so painstakingly beautiful yet so dramatically inert. Musically there is much to enjoy. Visually, as lovely as the costumes, settings, etc. are, I found this Orfeo to be a crashing bore.Mr. Zanasi's Orfeo, while at times beautifully sung, is almost comical, looking more like a plump, Spanish businessman at a costume party and his acting is close to nil.Trish Brown's stunning, minimalist production of Orfeo with the simply amazing Simon Keenlyside dancing and singing the title role with Brown's dance company was shown throughout Europe on television (and available on inferior quality pirate DVD), is far and away more moving, equally musical (Rene Jacobs and an early music ensemble) and would be a better choice for DVD release than this production.Very disappointing."
3,Great Props bad singing.,Great props. Bag singing..im selling it back to amoeba records in Los Angeles.
2,"Poor Description, Misleading picture","Do not be fooled by the picture of 4 glasses. I ordered 3 in hopes of receiving 12 glasses. NOPE! I received 3 glasses in a package made for 4 and the box clearly stated ""DO NOT SELL INDIVIDUALLY"" I am definitely calling the company asking where my remaining 9 glasses are! The glasses themselves are quite beautiful and hand blown crystal."
1,Eeeehhh,"I personally didn't like this book, and I didn't even read the entire thing. It just didn't ""do it"" for me. I got through the first chapter, read a chapter near the end, and that was enough. I guess if you're interested in being a complete narcissist, or learning about what's ""wrong"" with the world, then you might find this book interesting. I found it depressing because it is extremely sad that some people in this world are this ""self-absorbed"". But, ultimately it is true and people of this nature will always exist. Overall, it wasn't a book for me. However, on a lighter note, I did LOVE ""The Happiness Project"" by the same author. I think it's a must read!"
1,Died 13 days later,"I'm not kidding, I swear to GOD! 7 days after I bought it from Circuit City the click wheel froze, I had to reset it by pushing the Select and Menu button. It worked great for the next 6 days...then one fine morning on the Q44 bus, the click wheel nor the select button respond. Naturally I tried to reset it buy resetting as Apple's Manual suggests. The apple logo comes(which is a good sign), then swoosh, the screen goes blank and the apple logo comes on again?(NOT a good sign) And the climax of the story, the screen goes Swoosh for the final time and that's it. IT DIED 4 EVER! I tried everything suggested in the manual and on the Apple website forum. Returned it for a full refund. SIGH! :-( I loved that Ipod, as long as it lasted. Don't know if I'll buy another one...ever"
2,too much for too little,"I really respect and enjoy the work of Hillman Curtis, and was hoping that this book would show me more of his PROCESS, ie: storyboarding, first attempts, revisions, more of the ""why"" that he did things than the ""how"" he executed them. The book's layout was distracting. If you are interested in a good flash book then I would highly reccomend ""Flash 4! creative web animation"" by Franklin and Patton. It's the best of my flash books and worth every penny."
4,Slightly overrated.,"Don't fall for the hype on this one. I love Hillman, and find him to be inspirational, but the book is less than it has been made to seem."
3,COOL...but not that COOL!!!,"I bought the book because of the awesome review it had, I am a Flash enthusiast admiring hillman curtis and thought that somehow I would take a piece of that expertise hillman has with this book. I share his passion in designing and the lines "" I'm a designer first, that is my passion."", made me even more convinced to buy the book. Hillman is an expert in conceptualizing but is lousy when it comes to book writing. Some of the programs used to create his other sites were simply beyond my grasp, thus leaving me with a big blank stare at the book. For his credit, the book helped me with other stuffs, but my anticipation with this book was somehow cut short..."
4,"Good, only if you want better.",This book is really great only if you want to improve your skills in Flash to be like the master himself. Don't expect to master Flash with the book alone.
3,Not for beginners....,"I was able to do some pretty ""eye catching"" graphics with the use of this book. However, I am a beginner and although I was able to follow the book and create some very interesting graphics, I never really had a complete grasp on how I did them or why it was done that way!The book was step by step, it just really did'nt clearly explain why you would create or animate your project the way that this individual did. If you have experience in Flash, I would suspect this book is very useful, just not for beginners."
5,The best book on Flash,"I've been doing graphic design for 5 yrs, motion graphic design is new to me. After taking some courses and read a few books, I'm kind of feel like full of knowledege but hard to find a point to start. This book : Flash Web Design by Hillman Curtis has help me a lot. Unlike others, other than focus on Flash special effects only, this book goes back to day one: introduce the background, how the original idea came out, and conditions which limit the design, etc.... This book makes me feel confident on using Flash. The example in the book are all real-world designs, which makes the best example you can't find from other books. What else can I say, this is simply the best book on Flash! (well, from a designer's stand point.)"
1,The Worst,"I purchased this book because of the beautifully written critique on the back by Frank McCourt. Boy did he have it wrong. It is the most trite, hackneyed piece of writting that I have ever come across. Save your money. This ones a real turkey."
5,Funny and Inspirational!,"This is a brilliant account of sisters taking their family's future into their own hands. Funny, poignant, and well-written, but most of all, there is something in this book to which anyone who's dealt with a life-changing illness in their family can relate. Edsall beautifully describes the meaning of flight and fierce passions that push everyone in her family to never, ever give up."
4,Amazing Movie,"It is not the Triplets of Belleville, but it isn't your usual illustrated movie either. The Illusionist is a beautiful tale that shows self growth, discovery, and life as a whole. It leaves the viewer with a sense of completion after each viewing."
2,.....not quite,"I loved ""Triplets..,"" and I was eagerly awaiting Chomet's latest work. The drawings are charming, the theme poignant, the homage to Tati touching, but all in all, the film doesn't hold together, the problem being that the overall narrative falls flat. The project was daring, combining the two visions of one of the great comic geniuses of the last century, and a very talented filmmaker whose best work is probably yet to come. But not unlike Kubrick and Spielberg's 5 endings ""AI,""two visions do not necessary spoil the broth, but probably confuse it."
2,disappointed,"Just wasn't up to par with ""The Triplets of Bellville"". The magician was fantastic, pulling wine glasses out of his mouth,etc. But frankly I was a little disappointed."
2,One of the flatest storys I've ever seen,"I bought this movie as a deal, I didn't read the reviews, as it has a great quality of animation I never though that the story were so bad. If you are looking for amazing animation, buy this product, if you are looking for a good story do not buy this dvd."
3,tough game,This game is a fun game but really tough questions about all sports. The players really need to know everything about all sport.
4,Some Really Funny Moments,"Episode 2, 'Portrait of a Marriage' is worth the price of this set on its own; the first season of Ned and Stacey had a lot of potential, but unfortunately that potential disappeared in season 2 - the male characters were turned bizzarely infantile and moronic, and the women weren't given even passable scripts to work with. Don't waste your money on season 2 when it's available, but season 1 is worth watching if you can get it for under $15.00 or so."
4,Good beginning for this series...Annie's People,Enjoyed this book very much. In fact enjoyed the whole series. I am a fan of Amish books and will be buying some more soon.
2,Three foot tall with two inch fangs,"Vampire dwarves invade a small southern town. They obtain possession of a sword that has traces of the blood of the last full sized vampire (dwarf vampires can only infect other dwarves. You should have known that) and plot havoc and, presumably, world domination. At least minions of full-sized vampire subjects. Half-vampire, half-human Drexel, with dwarf sidekick T-Bone, combine to battle the evil dwarves.ANKLE BITERS is pretty dreadful. Everything from acting to editing to the script is below average, is some cases way below. If you're looking for a real vampire hunter movie check out BLADE or JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES. The dwarves are a nice twist, but the movie doesn't come near to having a clue about what to do with them."
1,one tall order of crap,"halfway through this steaming 3 foot poo-pile, we turned on the lights, my girlfriend went to check her e-mail, and i went to get food--without pausing the movie. writer, director, star adam m. is a thief. he stole the idea for this ""film"" as well as my time. the redneck dwarfs are unintelligible, and who knew one can execute a backflip to avoid being shot by an arrow? i would've given this movie 2 stars if the cast would've been british, but as it stands it gets 1 star for having a deceptively attractive dvd case."
3,Pretty Good,I bought this as a gift for my little cousin. She has just started cheerleading and she seemed to really like the movie. Ihave watched it also and it was good. If you like cheerleading or are a cheerleader I recommend the movie.
1,Needs Work,"This book does not lend itself to an introductory class in geochemistry for the graduate student. The material does not present comprehensive derivations of calculations, but relies on prior knowledge and assumption not generally available,or known by the graduate student first being introduced to Geochemistry. The majority of the book is normally only comprehensable to the student after the material has been described by persons knowledgable in the subject mater. In other word this book is worthless to read prior to the lecture on the subject mater. Furthermore, the appendices are full of errors and contradictions to other references, and the book has numerous typos and difficult language constructs that make the text incomprehensible at times. I hope there is a better book for the introductory graduate class in geochemistry out there, because this book does not cut it."
1,Too boring to even finish,"Everything about this book looked interesting to me. The dialogue just gets too bogged down to keep going. There were several pages of the bride and groom in the car trying to get to their own reception. Move it along! Ellie's meandering thoughts were tiresome and after reading more than halfway through the book, I skipped to the end. I never do that, but I couldn't take anymore."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"since I loved her first one, The Thin Woman. I jumped into The Widow's Club with two feet and found that it was disjointed and plain boring. The plot had potential, but Ms. Cannell rambled on at such length that I found myself skimming pages and wondering when it would be over. I was disappointed in this book. Only the last ten pages were at all worth my time, but that may have been simply because I saw a light at the end of the tunnel."
5,A Great Book!,"Quality Concealed contains well-developed characters that immediately become like friends you have known for ages. The book is cleverly written and pulls you in-I read the book in one sitting! I didn't know very much about horse shows prior to reading this book, but thanks to the clear diagrams displayed in the book and the skillful way Briggs describes the horse shows that occur in the story, I understood and was intrigued by the material. This is an enjoyable book to read."
5,For quick crochet projects.,"I love this Thick and Quick yarn. It took two balls to crochet a child size hat and scarf set. It would take about three balls to make an adult hat and scarf set.The yarn is soft and plush. It's not so scratchy as some yarns can be. Each strand is thick, so the projects work up quickly, and they're very easy to see when crocheting.The color is a softer shade of pink, perhaps some might describe it as dusty rose.I think the thing with yarn is to find a stitch that shows it off. I found that crocheting with alternating half double croshet in the front and then back loops works well. It gives the fabric a lot of texture and lets the scarf drape. I used single crochet for the hat and that gave the hat more form and stiffness.I like this yarn very much and look forward to using it in future projects."
2,Cortese overlooks Father of Combinatorial Libraries,Cortese missed the father of Combinatorial Chemistry i.e. Professor George Pieczenik. Professor Pieczenik first explained the concept of combinatorial chemistry to Cortese in his own house in Italy. Cortese seems to have forgotten his professor's instructions. Otherwise a useful book.
4,Portable presenter mouse,This is a great mouse if you do a lot of powerpoint presentations on the go! I love the size and comfortable feel for basic use.
5,a journey 4 those mentally & spirtually willing and able,"The images containd in this book are frighteningly familiar and distanlty arranged. With every page the reader will be forced to go wherever the lines may travel. To and fro the words swagger and stumble. Gifted and pitiful, sad scenes flood out onto the page. Sexual-sciFi, erotica at it's finest before it ever had a name. Psycho-manipulative and potent. At times it will make you laugh, both in humor and in disgust. A definite add-on to any literate collector of art. Intense and a very fine book of scattered wisdom."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:Mennonite Studies, 2003. BV2073 .B43Anabaptist biblical scholarship has led the way in the late twentieth century in creative and challenging analysis of issues related to peacemaking. This book is a major contribution to this tradition. Here Anabaptist scholars interact with contemporary scholarship at all levels, entering into debates on biblical texts. The authors establish not only that themes of peace and mission exist in a clear and fascinating relationship but also that people can no longer think of peace in the Bible without discussing mission in its Hebrew and its early Christian varieties."
3,nice poli sci anthology on no. 1 Latino group,"This is a book of sharp poli sci articles about Chicano political concerns. The range of topics is broad: affirmative action, mayoral elections, immigration matters, even revolutionary theater. This would be a great book for Latino or ethnic studies majors to have in their personal libraries. I have one criticism: some of the articles are long on description and short on analysis. Further, don't let the title fool you. Talking about the ""late 20th Century"" may seem passe now. However, the issues brought up in this book are especially important still in the new millenium. This book would be great for Latino political science majors as well."
1,This book's basis is unscriptural...,"There are many ways in which to honor God, the easiest being the giving of a tenth of one's income. As presented, this book undermines the Bible and promotes robbing God of the tithe. The informed Christian clearly knows that there is an abundance of scriptures to support tithing. God specifically states in Malachi 3:8 that if we do not bring the tithes and offerings into the storehouse (church), that we are robbing Him. The Bible outlines in Matthew 23:23 & Luke 11:42 what will happen to the pharisees, hypocrites and spreaders of false teaching should they reject the tithing message."
4,Interesting Historical Fiction,"The Cardonal's heir is an entertaining read, though I could not help seeing the future Hollywood film treatment rolling in my head as I read. The character development is good, and the novel gives a detailed impression of life during the Louis XIII reign in France. There is just enough magic and mysticism to remind the reader that the story is, after all, fiction. Fans of the historical novel genre should enjoy the book."
3,Delightful,"Guerite, as she's fondly called, is a base born woman living during the time of Cardinal Richelieu and the musketeers. Only two of the famous quartet appear, but this is not a continuation of their story. Guerite is Richelieu's niece and the leader of his spy network. She's been tasked with uncovering the perpetrators of his murder, and thus, many hijinks ensue.This was a fun read. Guerite is a spunky protagonist who embraces her sex and finds love in the process. Being a fan of alternative history, I realize that many of the plot points found in the book would never happen, but that's the point. Guerite is believable as a woman of strength and resolve. Though she's bound by the limits of her society, the fact that she's respected and placed in a position of power is refreshing.The secondary characters could have used a bit more development. And I think I missed a bit having not read The Three Musketeers."
3,Basic sweat but not a great fit,"These are too loose fitting, and long, to be great sweats. Even not that useful for running around on a casual day. They are well priced, and fun color accents, but overall not a reorder for me. If you are looking for very loose sweats, they might be fine"
2,Great!,Got it for my brother. shipped in a well amount of time and was well made. awesome! he enjoyed it
4,A teddy bear murder,"Still recovering from a near-fatal shooting in his previous outing (""There Was A Little Girl""), Calusa, Florida, lawyer Matthew Hope finds a trademark case escalating into murder.The eponymous bear is the creation of his toy-designer client, Lainie Commins, whose former employers, Etta and Brett Toland, have produced a similar cuddly toy and are about to destroy her big chance with their greater market clout.Naturally, when Brett is found murdered aboard his boat, with plenty of witnesses attesting to Lainie's presence, and her scarf found near the nude body, she is the prime suspect.Matthew's investigation proves increasingly damaging to Lainie, whose story changes with every telling. Meanwhile, Matthew's cohorts, Warren Chambers and Toots Kiley, in an entirely seperate subplot, are engaged in a drug battle on a drifting boat.McBain's laconic, mannered prose lends a familiar rythm to this well-paced story laced with moral ambiguities, some of which are Matthew's own."
2,A Disappointment,"I am a big fan of Ed McBain / Evan Hunter, expecially his 87th precinct books. They have set the standard for the police procedural framework. I have been luke warm towards his Matthew Hope works, feeling that there are lots of lawyers-as-detectives out there. This particular book I found slow developing and the plot was not that gripping. To be honest, I didn't finish the book, so maybe it picked up towards the end. I hope so."
3,Does the Job,"I bought these to label my home brew bottles. They work well in the printer and stick nicely. Only downside is that the ink runs from condensation on the bottles - not really the labels fault. They come back off the bottle pretty well provided the labels are dry, if you get them wet then they disintegrate and you are left scraping the glue off bit by bit."
4,Malco Fiber Cement Siding Gauge,This is a really good product and the price was right. I used the gauges to install fiber cement board on my 12 X 16 shed. These really made the job a lot easier to install the boards. They are great if you are working alone. Definitly would recommend them to my friends. Very glad I bought them.
4,Great for working alone.,"For $20.00, it was definitely worth it. There is a little weirdness though. The exposure is not exactly 4"". It averages around 3 3/4"" to 3 7/8"". It seems to work best on 12 foot boards. When you press down to nail the board, the exposure seems to get the closest to 4"". On shorter runs, I used only one gauge to hold up one end while I nailed the other end."
3,Interesting but not good for a first book.,"This text is nicely produced and has some interesting examples of Haskell programming. However, the book is mainly examples of Haskell and functional programming rather than explanations of Haskell and FP. The exposition is spotty and assumes a lot. It would best be considered a second book for those learning Haskell."
4,70's flashback?,"actually, i purchased this game because of a good review on G4tv. as a general rule, i am not a pinball video game fan; however this has something for everyone! the sights and sounds alone took me back to my youth in the 70's! even if your a diehard rpg, platformer or sports game diehard; this is definately worth the price of a rental looksee, and for myself, was worth every penny to buy. you won't get tired of this one quickly!"
5,Great bargain,"Much better lug nut than the OEM two-piece crap that came on my magnum, and a lot less expensive too."
5,This isn't meant for acoustic instruments,"I own several Audio Technica microphones and accessories in my recording studio and even though I don't have a PRO63 among my gear, I'm sure this item follows the same quality standards as all their other products. What one must bear in mind is that this is a DYNAMIC microphone, so it's ideal for recording instrument cabinets or even loud vocals. In order to record acoustic instruments one must employ a CONDENSER micrphone, which has a wider frequency response (it's highly sensitive) making it susceptible to even the faintest sounds. For those who need to record acoustic instruments such as violins, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc, I recommend theAudix Fusion 15 Mic. I have two of them in my studio, they're affordable and produce wonderful results!"
1,Useless for acoustic instruments,"I tried playing my violin into this. You can only get amplified sound out of it when the soundbox of the violin is six inches or less away from the mic - I think that's useless. If you thrash out chords violently on an acoustic guitar, then this'll probably pick up your sound from about eight inches away. I was disappointed."
5,Still love the mac...,"I've been using my new iMac for just a few days after my 800mhz G4 iMac died after only two years (hard drive and dvd drive failure according to tech support). Luckily the repair center I took my old computer to for repair (thank God for Applecare btw...) offers trade-ins and I decided to upgrade to a G5. For some reason the G5's 17"" screen one looked smaller than the G4's so I went with the 20"" instead of upgrading the RAM. I think I made a wise decision every time I look at the screen! It is HUGE! The processor speed is considerably faster than my old computer so I can live without the extra RAM for now. I'm still kinda bummed about my old iMac's hardrive and it has me cautious about moving the monitor/computer too much since it's all one unit but I'm probably just being paranoid. The only complaint I had was trying to get all my iPod mp3's back onto the new computer but that's another review. Also, Virtual PC 6.1 does NOT work on the G5..you'll need to upgrade to version 7."
4,apple response,"pleased with unit, arrived in great shape--thank you. had to have tech to remove network application, other than that okay"
2,Great looking machine pity about modem,"This machine looks really good .However the problem is that there is no built in modem so if you dont have a external modem to connect to or broadband then its useless in connecting to Internet .This is not the same as my Powerbook G4 which has an internal modem.Tried to connect an old compaq modem up to the G5 and absolutely nothing happened , however this external modem works fine with G4.Have ordered a apple usb modem weeks ago - but no sign of it so far, guess they are having to manufacture a lot of them.My wife furious for inflicting her with somethimg which I wanted due to my liking of the powerbook ."
4,Sonia Choquette Oracle Cards,"I am enjoying these cards. Sonia designs her cards in which you need to use your own ""vibes"". She doesn't give a lot of verbage on the cards so I used a label maker and put the definitions from the book onto the cards my self. The cards are visually enjoyable."
2,Poor simple construction,Open waist band that can dig into skin. No pockets! I guess you have to tie your key in your shoelace and your mp3 player had better have a clip.
3,QUALITY EXCEEDS RUSSELL ATHLETIC BUT DRAWBACKS,I bought both these and russell athletics shorts. the cord broke on the russell. this is much superior in that regard. there is an elastic waistband and also a superior cord. i left one star on russell. read my review.another drawback in these is the lack of pockets.
2,"Whaat, no pockets?",These shorts are not what I expected. They used a thin light material and no pockets! I have purchased Champion shorts in the past with heavy cotton material and pockets. These are not what I expected and will not purchase these ever again.
1,waste of money,"I was looking for a few pairs of comfortable lounge shorts for my husband. These were a good price and sounded like just what I needed. After the first wash (on two pair) the elastic is already falling off. Stiching is not proper and the elastic was hard and itchy. Would return, but we live in Belize and it's not worth the hassle.I would not recommend wasting your money on these."
2,Not quite as advertised. And no pockets.,"These shorts are not quite as advertised: they're 90% cotton, 10% polyester; but it feels like there's more synthetics in it than that, as the texture is a bit rough. Having said that, they're good value at the price. People should also be aware, as I was not, that they have no pockets."
3,Champion shorts,"They're not as big and blousy as the picture makes them look. They are also of thin material. I take a large, but I suppose they would be better in an x-large. I'll just use them for sleep shorts."
4,Great workout shorts,The only flaw I could search for was no pockets but that was a reach .Beyond that I wear them a good deal .
1,Poorly organized customer service,"I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said ""covered elastic waistband"". Instead, I received an ""uncovered"" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised???"
3,Okay but,"Elastic waist band feels a size smaller than the rest of the garmet though stretch is adequate for weating. However, the elastic is very rough and uncomfortable if next to bare skin. Too bad, as the rest of the shorts are very nice for totally casual gear."
3,Rubber covers come off,"It does what it is supposed to. However if I had known before hand, I would have glued the rubber grip to the point of the hooks. I lost a rubber cover and scratched my fairing pretty bad. It is really useful but beware the rubber coming of the hooks and scratching your bike. It was big enough to secure a 12 pack of Stella Artois bottles onto my cbr600rr tank. Also was able to get take out plates and such strapped to the tank so that was helpful. I recommend this, just glue those rubber cups onto the hooks permanently."
5,UK Hip Hop Invasion,"If Roots Manuva was UK hip-hop's Columbus (without all the slaughtering) - the first UK MC to seriously hit US shores - then Ty is the first and best of a growing wave of immigrants, bringing refreshingly original and well thought out hip hop to the stale, tired market that is US hip-hop (notwithstanding a few notable underground MC's that continue to represent here). Oh yeah, and his beats are bangin'. Anyway, I'm too lazy to go through every song on the album - just get it. The lyrics are funny and intelligent as hell and the beats will snap your neck off. What more do you want? You want More?PS: Ty's also a lable-mate of Roots Manuva's, and the remix they do together of Ty's ""You Want More?"" (remix not on album) is just tight as hell."

1,worst ppv,this was a bad ppvall the matches were bad includeing the emliantion chamber matchzero stars for all the matches
4,Best WWE PPV of 2002 by far,"Well, what can I say? It was like 1999 again or something. WWE actually put out a PPV that had only one bad match, and lots of great action. Good performances from nearly everybody, mostly good booking, and virtually no Stephanie. It's just too abd they followed this up with such a flop."
5,Never Gets Old,"Love listening to this Duke Ellington collection of tunes. I could listen to it every day and never tier of it. This is great background music for my home office, since it's not distracting. Uplifting and fun for anyone who enjoys music of this time."
4,nice set of blades,This is a nice set for most people. Give you a good selection for most jobs. Really like the case. I can put almost all my blades in there and toss it in my bag with the saw without them getting all bent and mixed up. Would have given it 5 stars if the case were bigger to hold longer blades.
2,Don't last very long at all.......,"I bought this to go with my cordless 20v Dewalt set of tools. This might not be so much the fault of the blade, as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set. Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard, you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade, and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw. If you have the same set of tools, or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade, then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with, and the rest of the blade is still perfect, but utterly useless.I have used other brands, with far better results, these are throw away blades, in my opinion."
4,Good gear,"Good solid blades, cut really well. Case is handy and easy to use. The kit would be perfect if it had a few longer blades, otherwise very good."
2,What a joke!,"I recently purchased this eTrainer, & despite rave reviews, I hate it. Often the program will mess up and stop taking commands and quite a few of the labs in the book don't work b/c the cisco commands aren't supported! I generally like Sybex quite a bit, but I really HATE this thing. It may be a cheap alternative to other CCNA certification solutions, but you definately get what you pay for. It doesn't even allow you to follow the labs in the Sybex CCNA study guide. The product just feels too rushed."
2,"Good for an introduction, but nothing more!","I fully agree with William Smittle from Oklahoma after reading his review of this product. This product is good for someone who wants an introduction to the world of Cisco routing, yet cannot afford to pay $800 each for second-hand routers. I only have one compaint, but it's a major one:They could have easily added more commands to the this product. I was trying to follow the course of Todd Lammle's book: CCNA Study Guide, and half the commands do NOT work. Simple little things, like trying to trace the path taken to another host using ""TRACE 172.16.10.1"" comes back with INVALID INPUT! Not to mention many other basic commands, which also produce the same result.Todd Lammle was co-creator of this piece of software. So I can only wonder if he intentionally left out much of the funtionality from the Sybex version only to make his $300 ROUTERSIM program look better! Hmmmmmm..."
1,Poor substitute at best,Very buggy. The software is OK if you stay completely within the bounds of the preset labs. Avoid it if you can. You're better off to try the CCNASim 3.0 from www.routersim.com or just shell out the cash for a lab.
1,This software doesnot work under NT!,"Every time I tried to run this software I get a ""core-dump"" or ""Blue-screen-of-death"" from the NT operating system. I tried to install it using different NT PCs, and had the same result. Sent an email to support@sybex.com, no reply yet from them."
3,CCNA Virtual Lab e-trainer,"While the e-trainer is fairly useful for studying, I would have to say that it's pretty buggy. To be quite honest, it's a poorly-coded, 16-bit Visual Basic application that's dressed up to look like a 32-bit app. It crashes when you attempt to telnet in user EXEC mode, and on numerous other occasions. Plus, *many* of the commands you need to know to set up a router do not work. I also wish it would let me install the whole thing on the hard drive and run it. Finally, I feel that the author's paranoia about someone pirating this mediocore app are ludicrous. Not allowing me to archive a copy of the program for backup is BS, and if a vendor were to give me that sort of EULA at my job, I would show them the door. Sybex evidently does not feel that these terms require them to replace damaged media at its expense, and to be quite frank, if I would have known that this was a term of the license, I would not have purchased the product."
4,Enjoyable,"Heaven is a touching story, that has you reading it until your vision blurs like many of V.C Andrews stories. A poverty stricken family full of terrible burdens and so much grief it seems never ending. Secrets nobody wants to remember. Living in a shack up in the hills, isolated from those better off, and having a last name -Casteel that would always taint their reputation. The only thing keeping them alive and with a little hope was each other, until their fathers desperation and greed took over, once their mother had left. He sold them, the ultimate nightmare of separation! The characters were sometimes bordering a little unrealistic in their actions, but it was still an enjoyable read, full of surprising twists and turns, making me want to continue with reading the rest of this series. I recommend this to people wanting to absorb themselves in a book that evolves into a great story."
5,An extremelly moving novel,"This is an extremelly well written book and I enjoyed it a lot. It stirs your emotions and transports you to Heaven Leighs world. It makes you understand the way she feels and how she see's the world. It made me cry and it frustrated me because every time I thought things would get better, they would just get even worse. I recommend this book to everyone. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down"
2,Not VC's Best,"I know I differ from other posters but I truly believe that VC Andrews went downhill after Flowers in the Attic. The idea that a parent would sell his own children is plausible as it definitely happens but it does not seem very believable in this book. Additionally, someone commented that there is no incest...yes there is. There is a brief moment when Heaven's father looks at her in a sexual way and her grandfather has to stop something horrible from happening- easy to miss but it is definitely there! Also if you follow the series she end up falling in love with her half-uncle! I admit that as a teenager I loved this book but rereading the VC Andrews books I found in my house recently, the only one I can recommend is Flowers in the Attic- the entire Heaven series as an adult seems contrived and amateurish."
4,I was drawn into the storyline and felt like a character.,This book was the one that set me off on the hunt for all Virginia Andrews books. I could not put the book down and had to search the book stores for the remainder of the series. Each time I felt I was in the story myself. A real tear-jerking storyline. An excellent book by a very talented writer. This one comes highly recommended.
5,5stars,Love this author! I have been reading her books since I was teenager and decided to reread the series. Love it!
3,KY Encyclopedia,"I received the book in about a week. Th only problem that I had I could not track my book, which was a problem, because I needed it fast. And also when I did receive my book the back cover is molded in in a curve, all the pages were fine, just the cover was curved. I would buy from this seller again, responded to my email fast."
4,Great to meet you,"Know nothing of this artist,outside of Porgy and Bess that is,which seems to be everywhere...I read the Amazon and Wiki notes before purchasing this album.It is a delightful survey album, by a quality orchestra and a talented conductor.My thirst for Gershwin has been slaked,thanks."
1,worst publisher in the world,"in fifty years of reading books in several languages, i have never seen a book so poorly prepared. there is not a single page without a typo, misspelling, wrong font, bad punctuation... some pages have as many as ten mistakes. clearly no one at the publisher read the book. apparently no one really cared. it's absolutely awful. don't buy this edition."
1,Wasn't the Best,"This wasn't the best movie I had ever seen, but Lisa Raye was so sexy in this movie. I watched it because it was on BET one day and I had nothing else to do. Lisa Raye was the only thing that attracted me to the film. Other than that, don't waste your time."
2,Did not enjoy this one,I had to force myself to watch this. The acting in this was just horrible. Chemistry all wrong. Rent this one at your own risk.
3,hate the clips...,Over all the hot rollers are great. You just have to fight with the clips.I may just buy another set of clips. Tired of fighting with the one size fits all rollers spring loaded clip. If you don't mind paying a few extra bucks for clips get this product. It does give you a shinny smooth curl.
5,Old movies are always better than new movies,This is one of my all time favorites and it based on a life truth. You can't take it with you. So you might as well spend it on having fun.
3,Wait for a better version on DVD if you can,"I absolutely love this movie, which is the only reason it gets three stars instead of none. The quality of the transfer of this movie is horrible. There are all kinds of nicks, scratches and even a momentary blackout. I wish Columbia cared more about its customers. It's clear they only wanted to get this movie out on DVD, regardless of the print quality. Although it advertises Trailers, the trailer for this film is not here. It is also not in widescreen format. If you can wait, I would do so. This version of the film is better than none, BUT NOT BY MUCH!"
4,Entertaining Capra-Corn!,"While this doesn't feel as timeless or as compelling as Capra's other films, it is a lot of fun. A very young James Stewart and Jean Arthur shine, but Lionel Barrymore steals the show as the crusty old grandfather of an eccentric family. As with almost all Capra films, the business man is the 'bad guy', and the happy family that believes in good old-fashion American values and aren't afraid to forget about everything else and do 'what they like to do' are the 'good guys'. It feels very stagy, but it does have it's funny moments, and Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur make a dangerously cute couple. An entertaining slice of Americana by Mr. Capra. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"
2,Audio Caveat,"One of my favorites but I must rate the DVD edition two starsince, while the videa transcription is near perfect, the audio transcription is very poor and at times not understandable. Frankly, I tossed the DVD and had my VHS transcribed to a disc."
4,Almost thoroughly engaging,I found the (obligatory?) scenes with young children a corny turnoff like when Barrymore and other times Stewart and Arthur are greeting these youthful hordes. Everywhere else I found the film flawless. The story like Capra's Lost Horizon has the message of the importance of happiness. BTW to another poster Frank Capra Sr. is dead and from way down below it's doubtful he knows what his son is doing with Sr.'s old films.
5,Arthur & Stewart are screen MAGIC,"This is one of the Capra films I always had on my list, but never seemed to get around to seeing. My family took me to see it one year on my birthday and since then I have made every close friend, roommate, and lover see it. Watching Jean Arthur in this film is a joy unrivaled in my opinion. The scene with her and Jimmy Stewart, in the posh restaurant is side-splittingly funny! This film also permits the viewer to see Stewart in a softer, subtler role than he usually inhabits in Capra's films. I fell head-over-heels in love with both Arthur and Stewart after seeing this film. If you don't see this, you're really missing out."
4,Great everyday reference,"Simple, clear explanations, plenty of pictures and tables. Useful quick reference for every day use. Probably not quite as detailed as Kirk or Ettinger but does not have the complications of multiple volumes (Ettinger's rule is that the page you need is always in the other volume!)"
2,Great LCD T.V. . . . but,"service not too great - that's why the low rating. This was our first LCD T.V. purchase. T.V. konked out within 90 day warranty - no picture. E-mailed Funai first (no response). Then I called Funai and actually spoke to someone - because it was brought through Amazon (not a store) - had to use ""Authorized Service Center"". Authorized Service Center has now had t.v. for 3 weeks, and I'm told they're waiting for power supply. Needless to say, the 3 weeks has now made the unit older than the 90-day warranty, so if something else goes wrong, I'm stuck. I'd recommend another manufacturer."
2,Soldier in Buckskin,Soldier in Buckskin is a good portral of the life of Kit Carson. However i think there are many more entertaining westerns out there. But still a good story.
2,Motorola's quality,I am highly disappointed in Motorola's quality of the MD491. I have repaired the unit eight times and replaced the batteries but have finally given up. I have ordered a Panasonic replacement phone system. The key pads stick as others have described and the battery gives a two bar indication then dies shortly after you start talking. I see on Amazon complaints of other Motorola cordless units having the same problem. It is a shame because Motorola produced quality products in the past.
1,Sucks,"We have the base station with three extensions. When the keypads on the first handset stopped working - we thought it was a problem with a single piece. But slowly and certainly -- all 3 pieces have become useless. We have tried changing the batteries but that proved to be a useless exercise. The sad thing is that when we had bought this set a year ago, it had great reviews.It pains me to trash something on which i have spent well over 150 $ . Don't think I will ever buy a motorola piece after this experience"
2,Save your money and do not buy this phone,"This phone was great...for a few months. The ""2"" button didn't work so Motorola replaced it and now the ""send"" button doesn't work either. I would probably look into a different brand next time."
2,not reliable,"I bought this phone in Feb 2004... It started out working great..no problems. Then it would not work at all ,out of the blue...It kept reading ""searching for service"" i was so angry..it was only a few months old..then just before i sent it back to the company..it worked ....so great right?? It just broke a second time and my warrenty is up...My cordless Uniden that is 6 years old out lived this phone. .It has not worked in 1 month......now i am here, trying to find a more reliable phone! This phone was truly a diapointment"
4,"Good phones, except for keypad issue","Other than the keypad issue these phones have worked really well for us. We have the maximum number (4) in our household and have never had a problem with range, clarity or features.Unfortunately the keypad issue hit 3 phones. However, Motorola customer support (1-800-353-2729) took care of the issue promptly by sending replacement phones."
1,"Buy Cheap, Get Cheap!","The buttons on these phones don't last long. My original set with the answering machine started to have the buttons stick after 1 year. I bought the replacement phone in November, and finally gave up in April. 3 phones, 3 phones that don't shut off (the buttons wore out).The phone itself and the machine were great. The clarity was awesome. However, in order to have a good phone, you need to be able to turn it on and off!"
2,Great if you only want the phone for a year...PHONE PAD ISSUES,"As so many others have stated, my key pads are going. I thought I was nuts the other day when I tried to put in my voicemail code and nothing worked. What the heck? I took down the customer service number and I'm hoping they will help me out. I'll write again and change my view if they replace the 2 phones. I mean, you pay over $125 for phones that only work for about 10 months. That's insane."
2,Awful!,"Somewhere, underneath the contrived plot, bad acting, cliche-ridden dialog and dreadful cinematography, is the grain of a good idea for a movie. If it weren't for the hot-but-not-hot-enough-to-redeem-this-film sex scenes, I'd rate this dog one star. Rent it if you absolutely must -- but keep the fast-forward button nearby."
5,FOR GROWN UPS AND KIDS!!,"This cuttie pink mouse its not only for little girls, no no, im a 24 year old who LOVES hello kitty and htis mouse is so girly and so cute that i couldn't resist.. it has the little wheel to go up and down the page and its really good"
1,please keep away from this movie !,"For all german people !Dieser Film ist ein schlechtes Beispiel für die Kunst der Horror-regieseure ! In den ersten 5 Minuten wird lediglich erzählt, dass ein unbekanntes Wesen sein Unsewesen in einer Kleinstadt treibt und dass dort ein Mädchen ist, dass von diesem Wesen angegriffen wird. Nachdem hier klar ist, wie sich dieses Mädchen (Ginger) infiziert hat, dreht sich die Story 70 Minuten nur noch um ein Mädchen, das im Begriff ist eine Frau zu werden. Im Laufe dieser 70 Minuten stellt sich bei Ginger eine Verwandlung ein, die sich aber nicht über die Verformung der Gesichtszüge hinaus geht (Katzengesicht ohne Haare)! In den letzten 5 Minuten kommt der Horrorfan zumindest ansatzweise auf seine kosten ! Es gibt tatsächlich einen Werwolf (Ginger nach Verwandlung), der aber durch seltsame Weise ums Leben kommt. EIN MESSER (nicht Silber)!Also an alle, die sich einen netten Werwolffilm wünschen: bitte nicht !"
3,"Wonderful, but ruined in America....","Who doesn't letterbox these days? American distributors that have no clue what their audience wants, that's who.Probably the best horror movie I've seen since... can't remember a better one. The acting is better than expected, and it delightfully breaks away from the Scream mold.If you are internet savvy though, pick up the Canadian version of this disc."
2,First Look Pictures DVD,"First off I'd give 4 stars for the movie itself which is a fun & re-watchable movie but the First Look Pictures DVD is a 2 star at best. The movie is in fullscreen which is pointless nowadays I think everyone would want widescreen and the picture quality isn't very sharp. The title screen only offers 2 options ""play movie"" or ""trailer"" that's it no scene select! In the end I'd probably try another release of the film."
2,What are these people drinking?,"WHAT?Scary? Where? Canadian Buffy.Poorly and slowly done.If you're into the study of lycanthropy-it's okay as it puts some different light on the subject...but as far as entertaining? Scary?Not at all.I agree with one reviewer-seeing a 'real' as opposed to CGI wolf is refreshing,but HAIRLESS?If looking for a solid,excellent werewolf movie-I've yet to see anything top ""American Werewolf in London.""I only say this-unless you study the creatures-RENT first."
5,Finally a good horror (recent) film,"I was very surprised because I thought this was just going to be another (""I know what you did last summer"") crappy teen movie where stupid teens get killed one by one, instead this movie is really well done, the characters have chemistry and the dialogue is fresh and witty. In the tradition of other good horror films that can blend humour and horror together I have to give this a very good review indeed. The last 10 minutes were a bit of the usual monster chase thing but overall I must advise one to rent this and turn the light out and get ready to burn baby burn!"
3,Could have been better,"I'll have to admit, I thought it would have been better with a little bit more gore, but I did enjoy it, and then bought the other two which were on the same par. but what I did like about them all is that they starred the same actresses in all three. As for Ginger snaps, It wasn't a bad movie for all these horror buffs. If you look at a movie strictly for entertainment, then it's ok. Never mind who directed it or produced it, just sit back and enjoy the movie like I did. I've actually watched it three times and never got bored."
2,Not enough bite.,"This movie started out with alot of promise, even had decent werewolf effects, problem was you only see it once in the beginning and a few minutes at the end. When I read ""Ginger Snaps"" I was hoping she would snap all over the place and wolf out alot. Didn't happen. Werewolves are my favorite movie monster and I was hoping to get my wolf fix with this, as you've guessed I was disappointed. Watch it if your in the mood for a movie about troubled teens, if it's horror your after look elsewhere."
4,Definately worth buying...,"Judging by other people's reviews, this is a film you'll either love or hate. I love it. It's not every other horror film you've seen, it's not what you expect, and it's not predictable. That alone would make it worth seeing, just to experience something original.The characters are very fleshed out, and the relationship between the sisters is more the focal point than the werewolf story. Rather than describing it as a horror film about two sisters, I'd call it an exploration of an extremely close relationship between two sisters who are faced with the problem of one being bitten by a werewolf. Their relationship changes as Ginger (the bitten sister) changes into a werewolf.And in keeping with the genre, it does follow some of the rules of teen horror films. However it does it subtly enough that you don't feel as though your watching something formulaic, but your appetite for the genre is satiated.This is the stuff repeat viewings are made of."
4,Good to see a teen horror movie with a little bite.,"It made me feel like I was watching a cross between The Lost Boys Teen Wolf and Carrie, which isn't a bad thing. Comming of age in a true horror fasion. Unlike many horror movies of late, the plot isn't cast aside for the sake of a good scare. (or in most cases a lame attempt at a scare) This movie deals with it's characters and their development from start to finish. I admire a film that has a place it's going and actually gets there.I did have one problem with it and that is probably the same thing many people liked about it. The drug dealing Hero. I'll admit, no one can be placed into a little box and told this is all they can be, but every 5th movie now adays has a drug dealing guy who sidelines as the super intelligent, knows everything that needs to be known and is all together about himself hero to help save the day. Only thing that kept me from a 5th star. ;-)"
3,Three and a Half Stars,"I didn't expect Ginger Snaps to be nearly as enjoable as it was. If you have evr seen An American Wereweolf in London then Ginger Snaps should feel familiar. It's a lot darker than An American Werewolf in London, but not done nearly as well.The acting is for the most part, very good, but certain characters could have been portrayed much better.Ginger Snaps is a very graphic movie. Especially during the opening credits, the gore is particularly disturbing.As a werewolf movie, however, Ginger Snaps is not bad at all. It has it's strong points, like the lesser theme of two outcast sisters struggling to cope with a world they don't seem to understand. There is some clever dark humor thrown in as well.Overall, Ginger Snaps is not a bad rental if you are a fan of the genre. It just isn't as well done as John Landis' An American Werewolf."
3,"Ginger snaps, Brigitte broods","Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are very connected sisters and very weird and morbid persons, having a great attraction with death. On the night Ginger gets her first period, she is attacked by a furred beast and her behavior and mood change. Her mother and friends believe that this changing is caused by her hormones, but her sister believes that she was bitten by a werewolf. Sooner Brigitte sees that she is right and tries to save her sister from the terrible fate.This is an unusual horror film. There are no jokes, very little humour and the attack scenes are strong (this is NOT for weak stomaches) and there's an overall very depressing atmosphere.Not bad for a Canadian film."
4,HrrrrHRrr,"Ginger Snaps is really a cool movie. I love everything about it... its characters, story, script..... Ginger is HOT! Bridgit.. she's cool.. I hope to see more movies of these two cool teen-age stars... And I love those photos in the movie..."
2,A failure of nerve,"Things start off promisingly enough: arch dialogue, amusing characters, deadpan visual humor, and an appropriate ironic distance from the main premise. That's the first half. After than, John Fawcett lost his nerve, and the film turns into a tensionless and conventional B horror flick. We kept watching in the hope that Fawcett would recover his sense of humor or his off-kilter sensibility, but no such luck."
2,Good snap! (For a bad horror movie),"Ginger snaps it's a teen/horror film.But what it was sorprising about it, is the human history that hides.About two troubled sisters, that fight and love each other to death(Literally).I was hoping to see a lot of blood and violence, hoping Ginger to really snap.But it never happened.But the good actings and that human thing made it a really cool way to spend time.It's not worth buying it, but it did the rental(Don't really know).It depends in the mod you're.Do not expect to see like 100 teen girls murdered and without heads, no.You'll only see 2 or 3 deads.That's why Ginger Snaps it's good for the kind of movie it is, but bad for being such a not original and boring movie.The end had almoust no action, and the scares(...) where were them?.Ginger should have stayed at home.FINAL GRADE: C-(5)"
1,Don't waste your time/money on this book.,None of the projects work. You will waste time and money and get nowhere. Really a zero star book. Abacus publishers should be ashamed. They don't even publish corrections on their web site.
1,Unreliable product,"I had to return this because the ""key"" wouldn't turn properly to play the song. It would wind up, but then not catch properly so the whole song was played in about 1.2 seconds. maybe less. I did not order a replacement, since it wouldn't have arrived in time for the baptism this was meant for. Normally I wouldn't necessarily write a review just because one product didn't work, but I later saw this same product in a Christian book store. Of the 4 they had on the shelf, only one of them actually worked the way it was supposed to. All of the others had some problem with the winding mechanism. So, it seems there's a real quality control issue with the overall product class and so I just can't recommend you even waste your time trying to find one that works. Which is too bad, because otherwise it's a nice looking product, very soft and cuddly."
4,cheese is good food!,"for a good time call 555-zombie king! this movie has it all. if you're a fan of bad drive in horror/action comedies......this is your ticket. hot chicks, cool cars, lucha libre big time wrestling, zombies, blood, boobs, bad acting........what more could you ask for!"
4,"100 Words on ""Enter ... Zombie King""","Wrestlers versus zombies, is this heaven? I bought this DVD the day it came out, not sure what to expect. In the best low budget tradition, it had everything: zombies, wrestlers, gore, boobs and, most important, an evil madman intent on taking over the world. Late night insomniac viewings don't get any better than this. My only qualm is the title. The DVD is ""Enter...Zombie King."" Why change the name? Titles don't get any better than ""Zombie Beach Party."""
2,Not as good ... check expiry,"Although I like the idea of 100-calorie packs, I don't think that these cookies are as good as others. Perhaps that's because the cookies that Amazon sent were dry & stale. I checked the expiration (""best by"" date) and found that it was in a mere 2 months. No wonder. Terrible, just terrible.We won't be buying these again."
4,Great Snack!,"These cookies make a great snack. They are satisfying and do not leave me searching for more food. They are enough to fill a sweet tooth, yet a healthier option than traditional cookies. They are also the perfect size at 100 calories."
2,Nothing works except Chaser.,"I wish this product worked. I was spoiled by Chaser, which has apparently gone out of business. Sorry, they just don't work for me at all. Nothing has since Chaser."
3,Superbly Average,"The book is filled with an abundance of information but it's really oddly organized and difficult to follow. It's not quite a reference book, and not quite a history book. The graphic layout is the worse I've ever seen. Page after page is nothing but trivial imagery. We've all seen bad hallucinogenic art and picures of naked indigenous peoples whacked out of their minds. The space wasted on these photos would have been better spent telling the reader how to grow some of these plants. It does not contain any useful growing information, i.e. usda zones or propagation methods. There are chapters for several types of plants, but most of the chapters are in quotations. When this book was published, it was more than likely the best one-stop resource available. I will keep looking for this century's version. By all means, this book is okay until then. My advice, buy it cheap or keep looking."
4,Schultes deserves a lot of Credit,You could call this a reference book for psychoactive plants but its awful fun and interesting to read compared to most of the dry reference books of all sorts I've read. Plants of the Gods is also full of nice illustrations and photographs. Schultes deserves a lot of credit for doing the leg work going into the Amazon back in the 1940s and collecting and learning about the uses of these plants long before the days of Ayahuasca tourism.
3,Bought as a gift so I don't know much about it.,"I bought this book as a gift, so I haven't looked through it, but it was requested by name, so I am guessing that it is a pretty good book."
1,great puzzle - poorly cut,"while I believe that the puzzle is beautiful and fun to put together, it was very frustrating to take it on vacation, start putting it together in hopes of framing it upon completion - only to find that it was cut wrong along the side edges. I am very disappointed. I would actually give it 0 stars if you intend to frame it."
3,"Better than the film, but somewhat cold and aloof at times","I tried to watch the film adaptation of this, as Cuarón is one of my favorite directors, and was disheartened when I found it too bland and slow to finish. I decided that I might have better luck with the book, and I was happy to find it much more enjoyable. This was my first introduction to P.D. James, and I found her paced narrative and careful descriptions to be beautiful and sometimes heartbreaking. My only complaints are that the second part of the book, Alpha, felt rushed compared to the first, and the only characters I truly felt connected to or had a clear grasp on were Theo and Jasper.Bottom line, if you like dystopian novels, this is a very good one to pick up."
5,"Depressing, yet true, future","I like the way PD James takes the readers to see the future England without the usual hi-tech, not relevant part of it. The story is a fascinating view of the humans society in England following 25 years of infertility. The story is the notes of an historian that along side the story also tells the reader his life story. I liked it very much also because the book will keep you thinking about even after you finished reading it."
3,disquieting distopia,"P. D. James has a very particular style, it may be slow sometimes, but she succeed in creating a convincing atmosphere, and conveying disquieting and dreary feelings. This book depict the life of a lonely middle aged profesor, who has to deal with guilt and the lack of a real purpose in life. In a dying world, when no new babies were born for 25 years, and people take their pets or dolls in perambulators, this man leads a similar melancholy and sad existence, until he finds a group of people who still have ideals, and want to fight for a better world, and revolution. I enjoyed the book. I liked it better than the movie (wich is no bad in any way)."
5,Food for thought,"I saw the trailer for the movie first, and thought that I had better read the book before I saw the movie. I read the entire book in 4 days, and with a 3 year old, that is a feat that could only be accomplished by writing that makes you hungry to read more. There is so much beauty in this book, even though it speaks of the end of mankind as we know it. The main character, Theo, changes completely from a man who has lost all hope and feeling, to a man with strength of heart who, even in ""middle age"" learns to love and to allow himself to be loved. The book is fabulous, from beginning to end."
3,"Great potential, but disappointing","There is a lot to like about this book, including the premise and the literary, expressive writing style, which I enjoyed. The plot moves along and a decent clip, with some interesting diversions into Theo's past.My biggest complaint is Theo himself. He just isn't all that compelling, and in fact, he's easy to dislike: self-absorbed (although he knows it) and, well, dull.I also disliked the ending, which I won't give away here. Suffice it to say, it felt like a cop-out and, in my view, came somewhat out of left field.So while I enjoyed the act of reading the book, in the end I found it disappointing.The movie is completely different--and actually better, in my opinion."
3,GUNHED returns,"I didnt know there was more than one of these. But the DVD is called Volume 1 here. Its a so-so giant robot film from Toho that was released in 1988.The so called ""robots"" really just move like stiff tanks on stubby legs, so dond expect anything like a Mechagodzilla in this film. The story is set in that samedark and dirty technological noir future seen in films like Blade Runner and Aliens.I guess this was cutting edge at the time, but this film didnt make it stateside until the mid '90s. American films from this period such as Robocop and Robot Jox are far more satisfying, as this movie is snail paced and somewhat hard to follow, possibly because of the dubbing. Not a horrible movie but its not in league with Toho's best. Buy Returner instead."
4,Catholic Homeschool,Thank you for stocking and selling this book of guidence. It is common sense and moral appraoch is needed today as it was years ago. more should return to child behavioral understanding - read this book.
1,did not work,"I got the dance mat and I was so excited to play it. I only used it 5 times and then it stopped working. I was so mad. I returned it and got a new one, but it did the same thing. I got the dance mat by konami. I paid more money for it, but it was worth it because it really does work. I even lost weight playing this game."
5,"A must-have, must-read collection","A collection of sermons, beautifully written and brilliantly inspired by our Lord and Savior. Like no others, these sermons clearly and vividly provide insight, a fresh and broadened perspective, and new depths of knowledge and understanding of many important messages throughout the Bible. Powerful, enriching and superbly presented, Spurgeon is a gifted speaker and communicator. You are certain to find many sermons that you recommend to others for specific application, solutions or for greater understanding. These are sermons that stand-out above many -- sermons that you will remember and cling to. A must-have, must-read collection."
2,INCOMPLETE!,"In a concise nutshell; I would rate this better- if the entire set had been mailed to me. Instead, I paid 35 and got only part 1-2 of this set, and I would prefer to have gotten it in its entirety. Not cool."
4,"if you dig the Art, Roach, and Dizzy this is a nice little comp.",Very cool little compilation. I really can't say if Basquiat listened to these specific tracks but i'm glad i purchased this cd. (i found it during a search on Basquiat)
2,30 minutes of cheesy music videos,"i'm a huge sublime fan and before buying this item, i haven't run into a sublime product that i didn't care for. this compilation starts with the kahne version of ""what i got"" and ends with the leary(acoustic) version of the same song. they're the almost the exact same videos. the only videos worth vewing are the amature ones, ""stp"" and ""date rape"". the only reason being that they show live footage of brad and not some super-empossed ghost in the desert or on some road sign. if you're an insane hardcore fan, like me, you're going to buy it no matter what i say. if you don't have the cash to throw away on a couple music videos, save your money and just listen to your cd's....you'll get just as much satisfaction..."
5,Monster of the Mouth Harp,"If you love blues harmonica, do yourself a big favor and get into the great Gary Smith. He's the real deal. This is not some wannabe backyard mouth harp blower, but very authentic Chicago style blues music. Features the great Jr. Watson on guitar on about ten of the sixteen cuts, and another excellent axeman, Mike Mungeillo on four others. A very authentic, down home and great blues CD, highly recommended."
5,I love it!,"I have read this entire seires dozens of times (and I am not exaggerating, ask my parents), and I still love it. I started reading this in first grade, loved it even though I did not understand it, and have continued to read it. I am now in sixth grade, and will never stop loving, or reading, for that matter, this book and the ones in the series."
5,Well Worth the Hard-Cover Price,"These Wren books are great, but i have to say that Wren's Quest is the best of the three. You can't miss out on this great series. There's a princess, a prince, some magic, and romance. Read this book, there's nothing to regret, it's well worth the hard cover price."
4,Family Tree Magazine,A must have for all genealogists. It is very informative and a great place to find needed information. Excellent document.
5,Panasonic DMC-FX01,"This is my third digital camera, (first Panasonic). I am rather ancient and like the stabilizing as it gets rid of shakey hand holding. I keep it with me at all times since it fits in shirt pocket. Haven't been in my darkroom since I bought the first digital. Made an 8X10 print this morning of mountain scenery using about half the frame (would have been 16X20 if I used all) and quality was as good or better than from my 35mm Nikon film camera."
4,Good Camera,"easy to use. fun wide angle feature. I miss my zoom on my old camera, but in general this camera is very nice for a digital."
4,Gladiator's,"There isn't a whole lot to say other than, it's soft porn, with a B rating kind of feel. Charater's names are funnier than all get out, really low budget, but passible entertainment."
1,Overrated pretentious drivel,"Spare yourself the pain of watching this film. The plot, if you can call it that, is thin and leads to nowhere. The script and the film both feel forced and pretentious. The acting is passable by all but I just couldn't find Anne Hathaway damaged character believable. Watching her in ""Rachel Getting Married"" I still see her as some squeaky clean character caught up in a family Disney film that has gone horribly wrong."
1,A Big Snoozefest,Get a bad haircut and then read all the bad (one star)reviews of this poor excuse for a movie out loud in front of a mirror for 2 hours and have someone use a shaky handheld video camera to record it and that's what watching this dreck was like. Negative 1 star is what it deserves as a rating.
1,Tom,"Boring, Do not waste your money as I did as this movie is Boring. Sat through 35 minutes and then deleted the rest."
1,"Horrible, horrible, simply horrible","The film is one of the worst ever. It certainly doesn't fall into the ""Comedy"" designation that Cablevision assigned to it. ""Drama,"" or ""Tragedy"" would be more suitable.An interminable wedding rehearsal scene is outdone by an interminable wedding.The film is 113 minutes L O N G. They should have cut at least 90% of it, and it still would have been 10% too long."
1,Hollywood doesn't matter anymore,"This movie mindlessly drags the audience through all this Cronenberg -meets- Dr- Phil muck--why? Because we will all be more understanding of each others' foibles at movies' end? Or because Hollywood has its head so buried up its arse that observing the real world right now it just completely out of the question?Cinema always has been, and regrettably, always will be, the bankers' art form, which explains why the Hollywood dream machine has been pushing identity politic$ down our throats for going on 60 years now. Sorry Demme, but your edgy take on multiracial romantic pairings doesn't cut it; there is no reason to give a shit about these privileged characters and their over-the-top, implausible infighting... The only question worth asking is, who bankrolled this wedding, and who did they steal the money from to pay the florist?"
1,The worst!,"This movie was awful. I watched 40 min of it and then shut it off. The whole idea of anne hathaway coming home and being thrown into this huge family event was promising. But it failed miserably. Why were all those people making toasts at the rehearsal dinner? Hathaway's went on and on bringly and then other people got up said stuff. ENOUGH. The music and hoopla was annoying and the whole interracial thing just seemed odd and forced.I saw Vicky Christina Barcelona the other night and wondered how Cruz could've won for best supporting actress because she was hardly in the movie that much. So when I sat down to watch Rachel Getting Married I was sure that perhaps Hathaway was robbed of the Oscar. Well, definitely NOT after watching this train wreck!"
4,Good family-crisis film,"The Bottom Line:Near the end of Rachel Getting Married director Demme sometimes gets a bit too wrapped up in the revelry of the wedding, but this quibble aside it's a fine family drama that avoids the cliches (incest, molestation, etc) we've come to expect from such films in favor of more anguished, true scenarios; Hathaway may have gotten the only love at Oscar night but there's a lot to like about this different little film that some find boring but I find quite good.3.5/4"
1,Big Mess,"Where did I get the idea that this was a good movie? I was expecting another family wedding story with maybe a little humor amidst the angst but I guess I should have known better just by looking at Anne Hathaway. She looked like a refugee from a bad acid trip and was just about as appealing. In fact, by the time I struggled through this conglomeration of unattractive characters of the rainbow coalition, melodramatic plot, dreadful and constant wailing, whining music and boringly Bohemian touches, I was ready to gag. The wedding party (pre, post and during)scenes went on forever and the speeches were excrutiatingly boring, as were the people giving them. This is a dismal film. Save your time and money--rent ""Wedding Date"" or ""Sweet Home Alabama""."
1,Awful,This movie was not at all what I had expected. It has the most boring wedding scenes that go on and on. Why on earth would we want to watch a wedding video of people we care nothing about? The reason why Ann Hathaway is so messed up is interesting and it could have been a great movie if it was written differently.
1,Pretentious,"This tries to be Cinema Verite, but It's not believable. So many of the emotional reactions are implausible and melodramatic: Rachel's hysterical reaction to Kym's dinner toast, Dad's nearly operatic reaction to seeing Ethan's plate, Rachel storming out of the beauty salon, Kym demanding to be maid of honor, etc. These are drama queens on steroids. It's annoying - not entertaining.As for the wedding, it has a constant aura of putting on airs. Look how untraditional, creative and supportive we are. Could we have at least one of the characters acknowledge how different this wedding is, rather than everyone acting like it's the most normal thing in the world? The film doesn't need to apologize for it, but it shouldn't pretend either. In trying too hard not to appear self-consciously eccentric, it comes off as false. And did it occur to anyone to ask how such a neurotic family could produce such a utopian wedding?I will say that Debra Winger is perfect in her small role."
3,Not my kind of movie.,"In the era of reality shows, this movie keeps up with the modern ages but, if I want to see people talking to each other non-stop and at the same time, I could watch the Bill O'Reilly Show on the Fox News Channel instead. It takes less time.Just call me old-fashioned."
5,"Not just good, GREAT!","I swear this is the best book I have read so far in my life. Considering I have only been here for about 15 years, this sweet blend of magic, tradition, loyalty, friendship, love, and above all life is a fresh breath of air to me."
3,Christians differed on whether to revolt against England.,"A very heavy book, boring unless you are really interested in the topic, as I am. I didn't know tht there were diffferent convictions about the Revolutionary War. I wonder how I would have felt. I probably would have been a Patriot and felt our country had to revolt."
5,One woman's triumph!,"Joanna Kerns was fabulous in this Lifetime thriller about a woman victimized by a serial rapist and killer. She survives the attack, and is then victimized again when the police seem incapable of arresting her attacker. The relationship between husband and wife is so well acted, bringing the tension and intense frustration alive.This is a movie you won't soon forget about a victim bringing her attacker to justice!"
3,"JUST LOWER THE PRICE ALREADY, AMAZON!!!!","i just love this littlest pet set!!!!! i got it with money my moms freind gave us for valintines day $5.00, to buy heart candy, but my brother and i decided on this. he got the pug, i got the chiwawa and we got them from target, and toys r us has them for three dollars just like target!!! i would not advise you people to buy the other lps sets(turtles, gpig,bunny e.c.t)and this one from amazon(i dont blame you to buy other good things from amazon cause IT IS the best online store), and IF you buy these little pet pairs from amazon its just wrong, because they are alot cheaper at other stores.Lauren M."
4,Not so bad.,"This book is indeed not complete and God help you if it's your one and only source of information on Bg5 lines (I can imagine some poor guy's face when his opponent plays 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Bg5 Ne4 6.cxd5 Nxg5 7.Nxg5 e6 8.Qa4+!? and he has to solve all black's problems over the board)--but if you are a Grunfeld fan looking for little-used, original ideas, you can find lots of them here that I've never even seen MENTIONED anywhere else. Just one example: 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bb5+ Nc6!?"
5,Loved it!!,So many ideas and up-to-date-patterns! You'll find the ideas and yarns in this book very exciting!
2,Not Exactly Quite There,"When I first saw this book I was very excited. However, while it has the potential to be a very good story the book, unfortunately, reads like a ship's log and, therefore, is very difficult to follow."
3,Nice rainy-day at home movie.,"Nightmare Street might not have been the best movie I've ever seen, but its parallel-worlds suspense was fun. As the heroine's love interest jokingly says, ""... Maybe I could sell your story to the tabloids."" I did enjoy the way he introduced scientific explanations into the story.I readily admit that I am a sucker for stuff like this, and always have been. If this was a personal review, and not for public consumption, I would have given it at least four stars.See it and decide for yourself. It's worth your time."
5,Must read historical novel!,"This book begs for a 2nd printing as it is a great history lesson for people of all ages. The characters are deftly presented, the prose exquisite, the introduction to great minds of the 1700s. Each of Marian Coe's books are a gift! And you won't want to miss her personal statement on the Author's Page."
4,Large round labels,These labels are wonderful for creatiing party favors and gift tags. You can personalize them which makes it more fun.
5,In my all-time top ten favorite albums!,"This album will certainly stand the ""test of time"". Cilette's soaring vocals are pure, covering a multi octave range, reaching into your heart and mind. Her voice is emotional in that it evokes strong feelings without ever being maudlin. Her co-writer, Roman, and the other musicians work well together to produce seamlessly beautiful songs. The lyrics are thoughtful and thought provoking. After 2 years of heavy listening, I am not the least bit bored with this CD. In fact, its on my all time top 10 favorite albums from the past 30 years."
3,"Mops Great, Handles not so good","I have a small cleaning company, we clean homes. I have loved the mops but all that I have bought (4) have had defective handles. The extension pole part have come apart and there is no way to fix them. Right now I have them taped with duct tape. I am going to replace the handles with ones from a store, I just haven't found sturdy enough ones yet."
5,Fantastic!,"A great book about two girls from Villanova University that each had an idea of the way they wanted their lives to go, however, they wind up following the opposite paths, and still maintain a great friendship (true story). The book is funny and interesting! A great gift idea! Great food and drink recipies!"
4,The Headless Horseman was a Hit!!!,Everyone who saw my son in this costume LOVED it!!! It was definitely a costume contest winner!! The only complaint from my son is he was VERY hot under the mask!!! The eyes were a little awkward fitting.
4,"Enesco Durham 9"" Donkey Plush","My wife loves it, but she doesn't play with it - she has some collectable bears and wanted a donkey."
1,Far Right Fairy Tale,Eustace Mullins has long boring stretches of information gleaned together from various sources. But he tries to make connections where none exists. His suppositions are not convincing at all. This book is useless as any source of genuine information.
2,Book is great...audio-version is a disaster!,"I'm very sorry.The past year has seen a shift in my reading habits from paper-versions of books to the audio-versions. Audio I find preferable as you can read it in bed AND in the dark, without your hands aching from a heavy book.One of my favorite books, one that I already read in dutch (my native language) when I was 11, in english when I was 22 and even seen the television-series in the mean time, was Shogun. I wanted to read this again...in this new format.How disappointed I was.The voice of the reader is boring to the extreme. Monotone, terrible accents, chaotic inflections. I again apologize, but I can't say anything positive about this adaptation of the book.I admit NOT to have been able to finish ALL of the HOURS and HOURS of tapes...I probably never will. I managed the first 10 hours so far.Maybe I'll find the time to record/dictate copy of the book some day...that will probably be my only chance of 'hearing' it completely."
4,good story read poorly,"I ""read"" a lot of audio books and unfortunately the talent of the reader can affect the result a great deal. In this case the reader has a slow drawn out pronounciation which I can live with. Unfortunately for the small amount of Japanese text his skill is non-existent. Although I speak some japanese I have trouble working out which words he is saying much of the time as he pronounces them so poorly - unfortunately I find this very distractingHe has given Blackthorn the accent of an English farmer or country Hick which also doesn't seem to fit the complexity of the character.The book remains as enjoyable as ever - but for such a lengthy venture it is a shame they could not have got a reader who could have done more justice to this exceptional story."
2,Wild ending (which really doesn't end),"Dissapointed with the final book of the 2nd Uplift Trilogy. The book basically closes with a frenzy of activity, bringing in new characters, new concepts, and new story threads with little continuity. Basically, David Brin, who spent a large amount of time building characters in the first two books, rushes to end his story. And it doesn't really end. I would have liked to known more about the fate of the missing Searcher people, and the fate of Jijo is obviously left for a whole new book. No real answer to the question of ""Herbie"". A lot of dangling threads for what was to be the concluding book of a six-book story."
2,disapointing,"I can't believe I waited for this. Although Brin has a good imagination, this work seems forced. His characters are always getting into impossible situations only to be saved by some miraculous event. Worse, many of the characters that he introduced in past books turn out to have no real point. I mean whats the deal with Alvin anyway? Or that space chimp? Entire chapters are devoted to them, but it turns out they have nothing to do with the plot. In fact, Brin blows off everybody on the planet that was the focus of the second book. Oh and we never learn about those mysterious aliens that owned that planet - apparently the egg was just another device to get some of his characters out of another impossible situation. In fact, all that hinting about the egg is really annoying."
3,Brin's reach exceeds his grasp.,"Do not expect anything like a resolution to the events of StarTide Rising here. Brilliant, up-to-date space opera that unfortunately suffers from the Too Much Of A Good Thing syndrome that has bedeviled an awful lot of SF since Frank Herbert set the sequel-itis meme loose big time. In other words: bloat. Heaven's Reach would have benefitted more by including less -- less of repetition, less of dizzying detail, less of all that impressive multi-dimensional, multi-species, multi-incident ""dross"" that only frustrates the story's impetus and, sadly, obscures our interest in its characters. This novel is a mind-boggler, no doubt about that. Chock full of wonderful, awesome, cosmic ideas. But...get ready for the NEXT Uplift trilogy, no doubt cooking on Mr. Brin's already overheated word processor right now. And let's hope for the best from the rest!"
2,That was an ending?,"Endings usually entail finishing the plot. This book just wanders off at the end. No explanation for whatever happened to many of the main characters (e.g. Tom Orley), or what Herbie was really all about, just a lot of vague allusions to possibilities. As others have noted, the literary ploy where you: 1) end each chapter at a moment of crisis, 2) pick up the next chapter with other characters at some other place, and 3) then come back several chapters later to the first set of characters already past the crisis, is getting really old by this third book (or 6th, if you count the earlier books). The fact that Brin continues to do it over and over feels a little amateur-ish, like it's his only trick. It makes me crave some good Asimov or Herbert. It's unfortunate because Brin is generally a good and creative writer, with interesting ideas. But like many authors, the finished product on paper does not live up to the potential."
5,SuperMario/Duck Hunt Duo,"I just like playing both games whenever I don't feel like playing Super Mario Brothers. I just play Duck Hunt instead, which I used to do. Super Mario Brothers is the top game on NES because of the graphics and the love of Mario. I just wish they had this game on Nintendo Gamecube or else enhance the graphics a little bit more or something."
3,Compressed Cookie Cutters,"These are cute cutters and come in a nice metal box, however the box was too small to accommodate the cutters so they were jammed into the box and had to be manipulated into their proper and pictured shapes."
1,discontinued: don't buy!,"Don't bother buying this or any other cartridge for the Mind Station, because LeapFrog doesn't support this device anymore and there is nothing on their website to download any extra learning activities for the Turbo Twist or IQuest."
1,Hanes Women's classic nylon Brief,"I have worn these panties for years. But this this will be the last. Poor quality. Save your money, find another brand. :("
5,Fun magazine.,I love this magazine for the colorful pictures of food that they have recipes for. The recipes are unique and a lot of fun for parties.
1,subscription started with last month's issue,Wouldn't you think if I subscribed to this magazine I had been buying it regularly? Way to start a subscription by sending me last month's issue. Would like to add a month to my subscription
1,Not interesting,Unfortunately I didnt like the contents of the magazine . Pretty boring I got my first one yesterday and it's already in the trash ;-(
4,Fun bouncy beats coupled with wistful ballads,This album takes me back to the days of yore...pure pop mixed with yearning ballads
2,Disappointing,"I found this book incredibly disappointing. Although they had lovely illustrations, I thought that things came too easy for Prilla, Vidia, and Rani, the questers. They only had minor hardships on their quest. One was that when they stole Captain Hook's cigar, they were about to drown in the sea, but Neverland's shore magically appeared and saved them.I also thought that the talents were dim-witted. Prilla's talent is a mainland-visiting clapping talent, which is very dumb. She imagines she visits another place, and by that, she saves Mother Dove...Levine has written many good books, such as Ella Enchanted, so if you are thinking about reading this one, think again. Ella Enchanted would be a better choice. Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg is Levine's worst."
5,East Bay Greasy,"Like 99% of bands Tower of Power will never match their debut release ""East Bay Grease."" But with Rocco and Dave back in the rythym section this is their best album, front-to-back, since the early seventies. Nobody, not Dylan or the Stones, record anything like their heyday 30 years later like TOP. They are carrying the torch of funk, soul, and R&B. Some of the new youngbloods would do themselves well to listen to ""East Bay Grease"" and ""Oakland Zone"" and see what keepin' the faith is all about. Buy this album now!!"
4,WHAT IS HIP - TELL ME TELL ME! - IF YOU THINK U KNOW!,"I'll tell ya.. Oakland Zone and TOP on this last CD. These guys Blow it out on this one! -It doesn't get any better than this. Every once in awhile there's a CD that comes out; you shake your head, smile and say ""unbelievable"" well here it is. I to have been hip to the TOP scene since me and my bro started spin-en, ""Live and Living Color"" and ""Back to Oakland"" back in the 70s and have followed them all the way. It's all good but this one, well it's on fire. I saw these guys a month ago in Seattle and they took down the house. If you like Funk then Oakland Zone is a must. If you could only take one TOP CD with you. I'd take this one. 35 Years and still Smoken! Thanks Tower of Power where do we go from here?"
1,So Uncomfortable and must pay own shipping to return inferior product,"Our family adore the original design, without the dropdown seat. I cannot even find enough NEGATIVE superlatives to describe how uncomfortable this company's newly designed drop down pajama is. Do not buy them. you will only spend time repackagine, returning and paying to ship a product that should not be sold until they make them comforatable - as pajamas are to be."
1,HORRID!!!!/SUCKSEGGS!!!!,"""Love Among the Walnuts ""-by Jean Ferris- is NOT!!! as funny as it sounds. It's about a boy that was isolated from the city. He lives near a house were ku-koos are supposed to live. The book isn't very good and it's only 220 pages long. I advise you not to read this book unless you love wacky romance. This is a book they probably won't make a movie of.I disliked the book and it wasn't what I expected. My favorite character was the bad guy named Bart. He was the only silly character along with his brother. The worst part was there was no suspense at all. This book is worth only 1*."
1,NOT THAT GOOD! (don't read it) ZACH,"""Love Among the Walnuts""-by Jean Ferris-is not as good as it sounds. It's about a boy that was isolated from the city. He lives near a house were ku-koos live. The book is an average book and it's about 220 pages long. I advise you not to read this book unless you like romance. This is a book they probably won't make a movie of. I didn't like the book and it wasn't what I expected. My favourite character was the fat bad guy. He was a total buffoon/loser. The worst part was there was no suspense at all. It is horrible."
5,Wow,"If you are a fan of exploitation films, this is a must have. I especially enjoyed the commentary (which clocks in at 3.5 hours...the length of the feature). Can't imagine sitting and watching in one sitting but great in short bursts or as something to have on during a party or gettogether. If you don't like the trailer, wait a couple of minutes and there will be more."
3,"good book, but thin","This is a very small out of print book. It does a good job at extolling the value of baptism, and it takes a high view of baptism. However, it is not a defense. It does not interact with other views. And it does not do in-depth exegesis of Scripture. But I recommend it."
3,Good Product - Sturdy Case,"This is a great product for $40 or less. I don't think I would want to pay more than that though. My only complaints are that the elastic loops make getting the tools back in cumbersome (I wish they would have put velcro on both ends) and the inside lining is a faux leather that is a little suspect considering the high quality of the tools and the case. Hint: I sprayed a little bit of WD40 on the snap-locks and it made opening and closing the unit easier. Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5 and I would recommend it to a friend."
5,Tough!,Don't matter were you put these slides...they are really tough! Good quality and I got it for a great price too!
2,"8"" Knife tip cracked","The set has a pleasant visual appearance. I've owned it for over a year and it does a fair job. Chef knif use to go blunt quite often. And unfortunately, the tip of the 8"" chef knife cracked and left me with dissapointment. I wouldn't buy this product again."
4,Wonderful stuff,"I grew up on Laugh-In and after discovering Ernie Kovaks, I realized that all those silly Super8 skits I made as a teen in the 1970's were unwitting rip offs of his short gags. Great stuff though I doubt it stands the test of time, most of the gags depend on technical slight of hand that is de rigeur today and the pacing is from, as Jack Lemon explains, a slower era. Still, great stuff and wonderful actor. A thinking person's comedian, for sure!"
5,Good Book,"I am pleased with this book. It is a second-hand copy, but is hardback, which I requested.The dust jacket is in good condition and there are no significant markings or creases.I am enjoying the author's insight on gardening.I will recommend it to others."
4,"XP Limited user issues, but robust, reliable and well built.","I have had issues taking the drive to use on public computers, where administrative access isn't possible and have been unable to use the drive at all.But the drive is robustly built, reliable, and the cap stays secure on the end of the drive. 256 MB now is pretty poor, so now I'd recommend against getting such a small drive, but if the larger versions are anything like this, the stability and robustness should be a factor when comparing usb drives."
3,"Dude, where's my car?","I'm almost 40 and have never snowboarded in my life -- although I was almost killed by one once! So I got this game for my 7-year old son to see if he'd like it, and we just spent a nice afternoon playing it. But my first reaction to all the ""stoner"" dialog was, ""Great, now he's going to want to wear baggy pants around his knees and start every sentence with 'Dude'!""Graphically, the snow effects and the physics are quite good. But inexplicably, the fonts used in the menus suck so bad I could hardly read them on my HDTV. Amped has by far the worst menu interface of any of the 10 Xbox games we have, and as a software designer who prefers skiing to 'boarding, that'll cost Amped a couple of stars."
4,Played it - Loved it!,"This title was one of the games I kept going back to Microsoft's booth at E3 to play over and over again. (I gave it four stars instead of five because I was playing an unfinished product at the time.) The controls were easy yet refined, the graphics showed great promise, and the gameplay was excellent. Basically when I played it, it was plain fun!"
2,The most annoying person ever is in this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this game was pretty fun. That is until i got to the third to last level where there's a snowboarder you have to compete with. This person has the most annoying voice and personality ever. Shes so bad she makes me want to stick a pencil in my ear and swirl it around so I won't have to listen to her. Along with her (or his, i can't decide) impossibly annoying voice there's the fact that she keeps saying things like ""that was ill!"" or ""mad-tight"" and also ""if you broke your arm my brother gets your pass"". No joke. Plus the task on that level is imposible. At first i got stuck a lot, but then i remembered i had the magical power to ride straight through stuff (rails, trees, pretty much anything). This level is god-awful, and it ruins the rest of the experiance."
4,Amped-The realest in snowboarding games,"Amped is the first snowboarding game focused on freestyle riding down real mountains. There is none of that cheap manualing down the whole run or pulling 70,000 points of every jump it is just real tricks off real jumps on real mountains. I wouldn't say the multiplayer mode is the best but the Career mode is out satnding. The point in Career mode is to go from a world rank of 126 to a world rank of 1. To do this you need to impress sponsors, beat the pros, stoke the media, and even just get the classic high score.Some of the Cons to this game is again the multiplayer mode and there are some really annoying sound effects.My ratingsCareer mode-5Multiplayer Mode-2Gameplay-4Graphics-5"
2,Not sure what to rate yet,"I was really excited to get this as I desperately needed it for my business, but I've yet to get it to work! (and the package looked yellow/old) It turned on & I got the little design up on the screen, but when i went to print on my item it wouldn't print. First I thought it was the ink it came with that was dried up so I went off & got a new cartridge...nothing...wouldn't print & this time after holding down the button like it tells you to do, everything on the screen just disappeared & I had to power it on again. So this time I took off & got a new battery for it thinking maybe that was the problem..yup-you guessed it..again nothing. Put it off to the side to try & figure it out later, when I do I will let you know."
1,A thinly veiled bigotry,"With the cliche ""hate the sin, love the sinner"" attitude, this book simply reinforces the kinds of bigoted stereotypes that have hidden in the hearts of many Christians who have grossly misinterpreted the bible and its various passages allegedly condemning homosexuality.When looking at whether or not homosexuality is a choice or simply inherent, there are specific value based consequences of one's own opinion on the matter. This book, which premises itself on the ""choice"" approach, exhibits the sub-conscious fears of homosexuality common to that point of view. When it is possible for a gay man to become straight, one must also open up to the possibility of a straight man becoming gay, the primal fear of those who are perhaps not as stalwart in their heterosexuality as they would have others assume.Although couched in positive terms, the author cannot escape the essential homophobia of his initial premises."
5,Well Designed,"Note: Ignore all other reviews that mention a handle that is ""too heavy."" Yes, it's heavier than the handles on the cheap whisks you can get at most big-box stores or the grocery, but those whisks are not built to last.This whisk is well designed. And unless you hold it with your entire fist like you are churning butter, the handle should not pose a problem. A whisk is meant to be used with a light touch.An inexpensive utensil that does what it is supposed to do. And that will last a rather long time. (Bonus? Easy to clean!)"
4,unique wedding gift,This basket is a great idea. I changed it up a bit by substituting a small bottle of red wine and adding wine glasses. The time capsule idea is great and the couple I gave it to loved it!
3,I've waited 55 years . . .,"I attended a Chicago high school from 1950 to 1954. A girl I was dating had an LP of New Faces of 1952 and we used to listen to it constantly; so much so that I bought a copy for myself. When the film version was released during the summer of 1954, I was a counselor at a YMCA camp in Michigan. On the only full day off that summer, we'd go to Lundington. Much to my amazement, New Faces was the movie of the day or week.In watching and listening to the DVD I sang many of the songs along with the performers. Amazing that I'd remember most of the tunes after 55 years. But I didn't see one of the more memorable songs on the DVD that I'm sure was in the original movie. It was ""Guess Who I Saw Today?"" I wonder why?Even thought the picture and sound quality leave a lot to be desired, the performances are wonderful and bring back good memories.Eartha Kitt alone is worth the price."
2,Wittman's widow provided author with family photographs,"I became acquainted with the author while he was working on the book and have a signed copy. No need to reiterate the complaints regarding writing and editing in the other reviews, they are justified.The author told me he interviewed Michael Wittman's widow extensively and received unprecedented access to her collection of photos while researching the book. According to him, she had been approached by at least three other authors, but chose to collaborate with him because he had been a tank driver.For those ferreting out every morsal of information on Michael Wittman, they may appreciate this book for what scraps of original research material it purportedly contains."
1,Doesn't deserve even a single star!,"The best thing that can be said about this book is the reviews it has generated below. Take the time to read them and not the book. I was bitterly disappointed when I started to read this book. After paying a packet for it I couldn't just throw it away, I read it all the way through. I agree with every aspect of the previous reviews. How this got past the editor is truly amazing! How could a publishing company like Schiffer publish this trash is another question. If you want to learn more about this fascinating tank ace I would advice you to try and locate a copy of 'Michael Wittmann and the Tiger Commanders of the Leibstandarte' by Patrick Agte, published in 1996 by Fedorowicz."
4,He-Man season 2 volume 1,"I was glad to see this come out. I've never seen the second season on TV, as I had to prioritize my studying at the time it was on.He-Man and Skeletor are continuing their beautifully animated battle of good vs evil in Eternia.Buy all four volumes of season 1 and 2 and stack them side by side on your shelves to enjoy the picture the covers make. Without giving anything away, you can look forward to a good set of extras too.I'm hanging out in hope that they'll release She-Ra season 2 this year as the obvious follow-up to this."
2,not very sturdy,"I thought the construction seemed a little weak. The wires that were used were pretty narrow and it appeared that it would easily give under the weight. I loved the concept. If they would use a heavier gauge wire, I might consider trying it again."
4,Kitchen Dish Dry Rack by Polder,I was replacing one that was 10 years old and this was great! I tried several other styles and they didn't work. This one fits my sink perfectly.
4,Not perfect but it seems ok if is questions on Biblical History,I am a big proponent of the KJV I am not a fan of new translations and i think they tried to appease everyone with all the different translations combined into one has potential for confusion which would not be good. was given as a gift just did not understand why not just stick to one translation.
3,Not what I hoped for,"I was looking for a game that would challenge my little ones to learn more about the Bible. To go a little deeper and find out more. But the children's questions are nearly all answerable by my five year old yet the adult questions are much further beyond her reasoning level. There's no in between. Plus there are only six cards with five questions front and back for a total of sixty questions for children. Considering I've got three children playing, we go through all of those questions in one game.The adult questions vary but are either no brainers or obscure quotations to fill in the blank. I was hoping for a game that compared to the Bible Trivia I had growing up but this is not it.However, we have had fun playing it together as a family. The kids like to play games and aren't yet old enough to care if the questions are 'too easy' :-)"
3,good for beginners,"this game is for people just starting to learn the scriptures. I found the questions too easy, will donate game to the youth minstry at the church."
3,i don't know,"be careful when ordering booties - these were too small for my dog, i think...but because she refuses to wear booties, i really cant be certain! it was kind of hard to get her feet in."
1,Embarrassing.,"I'm astounded that Harlan Ellison thought to publish such a work. Not only does he malign the dead, who cannot defend themselves (and notice he waited to publish it until after Gene Roddenberry died), but he dwells in poison over events that happened thirty years ago.Further, a writer of Ellison's experience should know that in television a writer's scripts are not their own. He was paid to write a script, just as a mason is paid to build a wall in someone else's yard. In this case, Roddenberry's. I no longer respect Mr. Harlan Ellison the way I once did."
4,Light shed on an old controversy,"I'm amazed that anyone who claims to have read the book can still really blame the controversy on budget-problems and keep a straight face. Ellison did more than produce an angry intro to the book; he produces fact after fact to combat the lies that have been told about him for decades. This is both compelling and sickening at the same time... very engaging reading. The scripts themselves were interesting, although it was difficult for me to read essentially the same script over and over. People interested in how scripts change over time will enjoy this, but I think you have to be in the right frame of mind to read multiple drafts of the same work. Don't read this book if you refuse to believe Gene Roddenberry had human failings and ambitions."
5,Looks good,I used this on my truck and it looks great. It's another fine product from Mothers to maintain your vehocle.
1,Doesn't work,"After many wasted hours and trying this card in 3 separate systems, I gave up. Plugging it into the PCI slot locked down each system. Save your money - it doesn't work."
5,Good fishing book,Bought this for my grandson who loves to fish. Book has very good pictures of a variety of fish and the equipment you need to catch them.
3,Food Combining,The Food Combining Cook Book is written well and has lovely pictures but for us it is difficult to use. The recipies call for ingredients we have never heard of and the recipies seem very time consuming. We both work full-time and our evenings are busy so this book has not helped. I would not recommend it for those with a busy life style.
5,SUV,Over the years I have managed to collect all 12 seasons. I love this show and my 5 star rating reflects this. The quality of the discs is in question. Almost every season has the label half scraped off the disc. I'm not sure if this is a deliberate design or a production error???? but it looks kind of junky. pk
1,:¿No mas subtítulos en español.,Why is no coming with spanish subtitle.My wife love this serie but after eleven season why not in english she said. I do not understand english Well .So i returned this copy.
4,A charming twist on a familiar tale,Unfortunately the two reviews already written have nothing to do with this funny and quirky movie that was a delight to watch with my kids. The story line was familiar but with enough twists to make it interesting. The scene in the biology lab is especially rib-tickling. Obviously not the horror flick (you can tell from the video cover photo).
5,Great item for the price,"I bought these straps for securing items for my cross-country move. The ratchets aren't quite as nice as some expensive motorcycle tie-down straps I got, but they work smoothly and I'll feel comfortable using them. I haven't been able to use them as I haven't moved yet, but getting four 15' straps at the price is hard to beat."
2,A disappointment,"This book is a study of the names of God. However, I found some of the commentary and discussion points a stretch - discussing sexual abuse when studying the account of Hagar."
5,This is an exceptional book and tool for diabetics !,"Finally, someone has written a self-help book for diabetics. The Diabetic Patient's Handbook allows each doctor and patient to know where and what should be done to benefit the patient. Knowledge is power. The handbook allows each individual to return to the doctors office with information to provide a more complete method of treatment and health care.The book is the right size to carry in your shirt pocket or purse. It could also be taken to other Physcians and reviewed as an overall plan of treatment.I Strongly recommend this book! It has the potential to help you save your own life and will provide you with the knowledge necessary to discuss your methods of treatment for your own well being."
1,What were they thinking.,"Is it possible to have an RPG with no movies. Microsoft seems to think so with their release of Nightcaster. This game is fine for a very young audiance (8-12), however for older gamers this is a bit childish. This game falls well short of my expectations."
2,A Single-Player Gauntlet Knock-Off,"It's almost painful to see a game with this much potential fail so miserably. The premise is superb - a lone mage fighting hordes of enemies with a wide variety of spells. Unfortunately, the controls and gameplay kill this promising concept. Switching between the different spells that you need is cumbersome, and you can only save in designated spots. The graphics are probably the only redeeming features, as the spell effects are impressive and it is interesting to watch Arran age over the course of the game from a young boy into an old, wise wizard.Overall I can only recommend this game if you are a serious fan of spellcasting-based games and if you can get a cheap purchase/rental price."
4,Cute!,Toy is very cute & my 9yr. old daughter enjoys playing w/ it. Definitely recommend buying the playset too.
2,not corect,"i am a guinea pig expert and this toy has some flaws.guinea pigs do not have tails,have flat noses and no guinea pig has hair like that.guinea pigs legs also are the same size.i do not recamend this product.also guinea pigs and bunnys are not related and it is not a good idea to keep them together so i do not know why they decided to put them together.go ahed,look up guinea pigs and find out your self."
1,this shirt shrinks- terrible return policy,i purchased this in size 2x as he likes them big. it shrunk sooo bad this now fits my teen and shes 13. rip off to return or exchange. i wanted to show them how badly this shrunk and they didnt care. they had the ill think about it attitude. ill never purchase from you is my attitude. pure junk material.
4,out of print?,"This is a very useful introduction to Irish poetry for people who do not have any Irish. It also has a very useful general introduction to the period and to each poem/poet; for more elaborate general reading I'd recommend O Tuama's ""Repossessions: Selected Essays on the Irish Literary Heritage"".However, I can hardly believe it is out of print: I saw lots of copies for sale in bookshops in Ireland: the anthology is used for classes at University College Cork."
4,Buyers beware!,"I had to return sets 4-6 of the Midsomer Murders in the US edition on discovering that they are not the same as the UK sets 4-6, which is what I wanted. The US sets are arranged differently and each one contain fewer episodes. Of course, the actual content is as much fun as ever!"
4,A nice headcover,I'd have given the head cover five stars but it is a little bit of a challenge to get it over the driver. Outside of that the quality of everything is great.
5,4HIM/Walk On - A MUST BUY!,"Okay...I never really take the time to write album reviews, butthis is one that I cannot pass up. I have been a 4HIM fan since1996 and never miss adding their latest project to my collection.""Walk On"" is an ABSOLUTE MUST BUY! From the opener ""Psalm 112""to the final cut, ""Love Boomerang"", I find no flaws! Personalfavorites include, ""Let The Healing Begin"", the title cut ""WalkOn"", and ""The Waiting""--listen closely to the lyrics in this one.It can really give you a ""faith"" boost in a trying situation.Andy, Mark, Kirk, and Marty have never sounded better! Awesomevocals, hot tracks, and great song material! Get this CD, put itin the player, and make sure the ""repeat"" button is selected."
3,Picture Not Accurate,"I do not know if this bag is good or not. I do know, however, that the picture showing the bag was not accurate, and will need to be returned as I'm looking for a bag with a narrow opening. This bag has an opening as wide as the bag is wide."
1,!!!!!!!WARNING: DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!,"This is the worst disc fixer ever made. Honistly. Don't buy this. And this is why.It all started when I whent to ofice depo. I found his on a rack for about 10$. some of my games were scrached up badly, and I needed one badly. When I got home I put ""Alien Hominid"" in it and followd the instructons exactly. After 15 secionds of turning it my thum hurt badly and had an ugly calis on it. Anyway, when I opened it it had even more scraches on it, and had weird little circles on it ands for evry scratch it removed 5 more apeared. about ever thing on this is an negitive. b-u-t ... it has some things going for it.pros+its made of cheap plastic-(you can break it easly when you get frustrated with it).you can give to someone you hate-Cons-It sux-evrything else-its made of cheap plastic-it sux-"
2,Good if you like things that break in one day,Ok other then what people are saying those circular things you call scratches are not scratches. it's excess cleaning solution which can be cleaned right off. the smaller scratches don't matter. no machine under a certain price removes scratches. just makes them smaller. your CD needs to be cleaned thoroughly. the real problem is. yes it can hurt your fingers. The knob tends to fall into the machine during turning(does not disconnect)then the pads just fall right off. returning this one tommorow. Your better off with the solution and a lint free cloth to take out the scratches with. it comes out allot better. Do not buy this.
2,Didn't do much,"Unfortunately, this is not the same as an actual disc repair kit. It doesn't trim of the plastic cover over the disc. It just covers it in a goo, that may or may not fix the problem, depending on the scratches. The cleaner is fine. But that is about all it's useful for."
4,Pretty good!,"This game surprised me!, It is a well made game, it could be better of course but overall it is really good, good graphis and gameplay, easy to use controls. The game can get very intense and frustrating. Rent it first but if you like air combat games then you will love this game."
4,Great for the patient gamer!,"Thunderstrike is a great game if you have the patience for it. Don't expect to pick it up and start gunning down and bombing everything in sight. A couple of hits and you're done. This game requires strategy (a refreshing change of pace for this genre). Graphics are pretty good, gameplay is great (once you get the hang of it). The missle cams, bomb views and zoom cameras are excellent extras that really add to the enjoyment of this game. Recommended!"
1,Don't trust this seller,"I ordered this item thinking it was a new product. I got it only to find that it was used. There were no instructions on how to set up the thing. Plus, the model I received was not the one shown in the picture. I wrote to the seller asking for help and have not yet received a response."
4,Catchy tunes!,"My daughter likes this one, but isn't too into Dora yet, so it may take her some time to really get into this cartridge. Right now she's fascinated with Barney and Elmo. I'd probably buy it for a child who is already familiar with Dora."
5,Quite simply a classic read...,Anyone in search of truth should read this book...don't miss this treasure of a book...it ls full of wisdom.Read This with an open mind and heart and it may change your life. I can't say enough about osho and his way of articulating the divine.
3,Tte Student Prince DVD,I rate this video three stars only because I consider this movie one of the best Musicals ever produced. If I had to rate the quality of this Dvd I would probably rate it one star. The video reproduction is fuzzy and the sound track terribly noisy and irritating to listen too.Come on Hollywood get your act together and enchance this movie back to its original quality in vision and sound. Its been done with other musicals from the fifties. Why not this one!
4,A very costly item.,"I agree entirely with Les Solomon about the price of this DVD!The strange thing is that this is a Warner Archive release which usually are pricedat about $26.00.However it is not even listed on the Warner Archive web site.So, where are Amazon and the other sellers getting this item from? Very strange!Have now found this on TCM's website for $19.99!"
3,The Student Prince,"Glad that this classic excellent musical is finally on DVD supposedly. While it is actually on DVD, the quality is lacking. It appears to have been copied from a VHS and done so poorly. All the same, it is very difficult to try and find the movie at all, so the fact that it is at least available for viewing is the positive. Well worth seeing if you like musicals and you cannot beat one of the best voices ( The Great Mario Lanza) and ""classic"" movie drinking song of all time."
1,"Cheap, out of focus, not synchronized","This was advertised as as new. It's new in that it is a newly made cheap, poor copy from Korea. Korea makes many good things, but these extremely poor DVDs are not the good things. There's a company in Brazil who buys the copyright and then makes excellent copy DVDs of grand old movies. I have an old VHS of this movie that is demonstably better than this cheap, tawdry, bogus imitation. It was badly out of vocus, movements were choppy and out of synch, and the audio was fuzzy and chopped.It is an insult to the movie business and the artists to put out this cheap crap and call it ""new."" It is patently dishonest -- not merely disingenous -- to advertise this as new.Let's all bug Turner to show this movie on TCM where a better copy may be downloaded that is far better in quality than these pirated excrement.But it WAS cheap. Caveat emptor!"
4,One of MGM's most underrated musicals,"A highly enjoyable piece of fluff that is well acted considering the content, and produced with MGM's traditional polish, plus Mario Lanza's beautifully crafted soundtrack. One of the biggest box office hits of its year in Australia originally."
2,"Remastered version ""Student Prince""","I just bought this so-called Remastered version of an old favorite. What a disappointment for a remastered DVD edition. The sounds are Ok but the color is terrible, it keeps fading in and out. If you really want to have an old favorite, go for it, otherwise forget it."
2,An unworthy sequel to a classic series,"Unlike the first 6 books of the lensmen series, which easily rank among my all time favorites of classic golden-age sci fi, I have to be blunt ... this sequel just plain stinks by comparison.As best I can tell, it was a half-hearted sequel written by the author many years later, and he utterly failed to catch the same lightning he harnessed with his original series.Save your money.{www.IBDoF.com}"
3,"Perfect for a costume, if you can afford a real Yacht then you can afford a real hat",Bought the hat/cap for a Halloween party. For the price the construction was decent but not perfect. There was a strip of pleather on the cap edge that I needed to trim back but otherwise its a very mediocre purchase for a mediocre Halloween party.
2,They sewed it up in a hurry.,"The material is fine, but the sewing job sucks. The patch on the first side is not centered. Sew strings are hanging all over the place. This was clearly a half-*** job. I'd be careful. Well I only paid $3.69, plus $3 shipping. But still...any product should be a well-made product. Or at least they need to update their pictures and show what the hat really looks like. That's all."
1,For a costume,"I know the price is very cheap, but the visor came crooked. I think I will use it only as a costume cap. I knew that I was getting a cheap cap but I did not expected something that cheap, the fabric, the plastic and the cord are kind of bad quality."
5,An invaluable resource,"The Late Talker is an exceptional resource for educators, administrators, professionals, and parents of speech delayed or impaired children. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in making a positive difference in the lives of speech delayed youth. It not only addresses the frustrations that the speech delayed population faces in the world, but it also gives practical suggestions as to what one can do to effect positive change for the child to succeed in all aspects of life.As for the reviewer who said, ""Take the advice from this mother, grandmother, father and grandfather""...""The author spouts quite a bit of say so, with no documentation to mention"" It appears in addition to confusing one's sex he/she also confused The Einstein Syndrome with this excellent book."
5,"Wonderful, Helpful book.","I am currently in school for Speech Language Pathology (speech therapy) and this book covers in the first few chapters much of what was covered in my first semester in school. It takes hard to understand information and makes it very clear and concise. I wish that this would have been the book we read instead of the textbook we were assigned, as this one makes more sense!Overall, a great book that everyone can get something out of, but it is especially geared toward children with apraxia and more than a mild delay in speech. However, I think the first couple of chapters are a must read for anyone with a child with even the most mild of speech delays.Above all...if you suspect a delay, get your child tested! EI is a free screening for everyone, regardless of income! The earlier you start, the better the outcome. TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS!!!"
5,Highly recommended as action/adventure science fiction novel and an altogether entertaining read,"Horse Passages by Jennifer Macaire is the story Carl and Meagan Cadet and the Federation, a group devoted to saving the beautiful and magical horses who travel through galaxies. Readers will follow Meagan and Carl as they choose to join forces with the Jeffries brothers and pursue battle with the Raiders. Meagan and Luke Jeffries find themselves have to escape from the captivity of the barbaric aliens, something that has never before been done. An engaging novel taking place on a world far away, featuring an intimately detailed plot, Horse Passages is very highly recommended as action/adventure science fiction novel and an altogether entertaining read."
4,comprehensive,"Lots of material to cover in this book. It's the lesson book suggested by my instructor. Full of information and the DVD & CD are helpful. It could use a bit more discussion, but, along with a 'live' instructor, it works well."
5,Worth Every Cent!,"I am a seamstress and have been for many years. This is one of my prized possessions in my sewing library. I have other books on fabrics but this one gets 10 stars. Not only does it list various attributes of the fabric but it tells you how to treat it, what foot is preferable, stitch length, etc. It is thorough. Also buy the first book Fabric Savvy. You won't be disappointed."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know...,"This contains everything you would ever want to find out before purchasing fabric. It tells you what the fabric should be used for, if it should be washed and how before sewing, the thread, needle and stitch size that would work best. It will save you both time and money in the end."
2,Totally agree with last review,"Of the 6 books1 and 2 are wonderful3 is ok4 is very good5 is ok again6 is awful, clearly was written without reading books 2-5, destroys the continuity, is confusing, and just bad."
2,don't like,board flat and flimsy ball don't sit down in holes not near as good as older models with molded uneven court to make ball move around
2,Bas-ket,I had this game when I was a kid and loved it. This game is not the same. They have cheapened it so much that it doesn't work well. The flippers are plastic instead of metal like it used to be. The floor is bent differently than it used to be and the basketball constantly stops motion. Very frustrating. When the old game worked so well.
4,Nice costume,"My ten year old, wore a size large in this for halloween. it looked great although it was short and he ended up wearing pants with it."
4,Great Halloween costume,"10 year old wanted to be Percy Jackson. This was a quick way to get him close to that character in an economical way. For an inexpensive costume, it was well made and came with lots of accessories."
1,"Ok, but defaintly could be better","The recipes were all pretty good, but the layout wasn't very good and the book was just bland. There was no index to what was in the book, no pictures, nothing in color, no categories, etc. If you just like recipes, this book will be for you, but good luck finding out what page their on without skimming through the whole thing to find one."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was okay, it could have been better. In my opinion Mary is a bundle of nerves, although doing what she did did proved the girl has some guts! Sometimes the story was hard to follow, but I worked it out in the end. I wished that one of the seniors died in this book though, by book 5 only one senior is dead! (Not that I liked her anyway.) This is a good book, even though the main character is a nervous, worrying heap and the plot was a bit difficult to understand at times. 4 out of 5 this time."
5,"love , Love , LOVE!!!!!!!!","Me and all of my BFF'S LOVE! the Littlest Pet Shop's we all have 34 and we love them I have those two ADORABLE baby turtles and they are soooooo cute and fun we are total animal lovers and we always say they need to make a horse Littlest Pet Shop that would be AWSOME so I reccomend this toy forsure me and my BFF'S also love Bratz too!.God Bless.My LITTLEST PET SHOP'S:The Summer Fun Beach oneThe Boxers that are brother and sisterThe Merry MiceThe turtlesThe Snow Fall Fun setThe White MalteseDoggie DinerThe Poofy Poodle and Bunny SetThe Chick and Gray Cat setThe White ScottieThe Bulldog and Tiny Cat setThe Skunk and Tiny Cat SetThe Brown and White CollieThe ""Adopt Me Please"" Cats (RARE)The Pig and Gray kitten setThe Butterfly setThe Baby Kitty with baby bonnet and carrigeAnd some of them come in sets thats how I got 34 Littlest Pet Shop toys!!!!!."
1,Nightingale's Song Disappointing,"I purchased this book with the hope of getting some insights into the vietnam era and specifically the Iran-Contra affair. The early portions of the book do present a view of the elite Naval Academy graduates in the context of academy life, career advancement and the Vietnam War. However, as time advances to the Reagan Presidency and Iran Contra, it becomes painfully obvious that the author is phobically predjudiced against Ronald Reagan and Oliver North. So much so that it is impossible to reliably understand the dynamics of the events of that time. What started out as well written and promising ended up as a big disappointment. However, those who have an idealogical hatred of Ronald Reagan and Oliver North will probably enjoy the book. Truth seekers will be disappointed."
4,Down Memory Lane,"As a classmate of the author I found it more than interesting to read his take on the influences of the academy, the war and the Reagan Years. The book generally rang true and although my individual experiences and attitudes were not the same I could recognize the author's and subjects' attitudes and responses. It was no small surprise to rediscover the emotions brought on by those influences. If the reader wants to make the most of the experience of the Nightingale's Song he or she must put aside personal opinions, biases and political leanings. You might neither like nor agree with what you read but listen and learn what can happen to the best of people with the best of intentions."
4,Very Good Book,"Very well researched, well written, all interesting characters. I would recommend this book for background about Iran-Contra, the Reagan Presidency, the career of John McCain, and life in the Naval Academy."
4,Chaos and Cool,"Thirty five years after its debut An Electric Storm remains as eerie... as queer and distorted as ever. Experimental electronica, it is hard to imagine this album taking prisoners. Most likely An Electric Storm will be adjudged either seminal or feckless... depending, perhaps, on one's state of perception at the time of earing.Reasonable reference points for this album, should there be any, may be Fifty Foot Hose or perhaps Tea & Symphony with some Nik Raicevic orchestration. Pioneers experimenting with electronica, White Noise can seem to emanate chaos as evidenced by Love Without Sound.An Electric Storm plays in stark contrast to the tightly structured numbers on the critically acclaimed electronica of the United States of America LP. Even more sedate White Noise moments, such as parts of Firebird, hardly rate as very commercial. An Electric Storm engenders an impassioned response by all who ear it... a minimum single spin is requisite."
2,This Novel Makes Reading WORK Rather Than Pleasure,"If you like John LeCarre, you'll love this. The British seem to turn out these spy novels with too many characters to keep track of, all muddled up in incomprehensible comings, goings, and way too much gawd-awful talk. I read for pleasure and it is just too much work to try and understand what the hell is going on, who said what and why, etc. These Brit spy novels also have the unhappy habit of no-emphasis on conversations and events, thus a murder equates with buttering a piece of bread as far as the text is concerned. Not for me, thank you."
5,ok,First time writin a review but hope it helps othersshiped on time and product as describedhave a good new year
3,Oh boy...,"I don't think I like the direction Godsmack is heading. The ""IV"" CD seems like it was put together with a bunch of filler songs, surely not up to the level of their previous material - maybe the record company was pushing them into another album too quickly? maybe they're trying to go commercial? I think of Godsmack as a hard-rock type band, but even the ""heavy"" songs on this album are kinda weak. Sometimes a band tries to mix things up (like the Metallica/St. Anger thing) and they realize through feedback that it just didn't work. I guarantee Godsmack's next album will be a return to some heavier stuff."
4,great new stuff,I've always been a fan of Godsmack.This disc only reaffirms my belief. Songs like Hollow reach a depth I've never heard before in this band. I think Sully is one of the most talented frontmen out there today.
1,A perfect example of a freeloader in Heavy Metal.,"What I mean with the term ""Freeloader"" is a band that really does'nt bring anything to the party. Yeah ""Speak"" is an ok track but it was written for radio play. It's like bringing a 6-pack to an all night drinking bash.I listened to this CD while on a 6 hour road trip with a few friends and did not think much about the CD. It sounds way too commercial, mainstream, run of the mill.If you like bands like DevilDriver, Slipknot, Lamb of God, and Tool, you will not be happy with this CD."
3,The Unbearable Lightness of Being . . . a Lightweight,"After watching SOMEWHERE for 90 minutes, I never really understood exactly what talent the protagonist, Johnny Marco, possessed. He seemed bored and listless. The movie drags on at a glacial pace, so ssssssssssssllllllllllooooowwwwwwwwwww. The entire script must have been about ten pages.Elle Fanning stole this movie, though. I thought she was great. I expect big things from her.Like Sofia Coppola's LOST IN TRANSLATION, much of the movie takes place in a hotel, featuring protagonists afflicted with terminal ennui.I found myself wondering, could Sofia have ever gotten this movie off the ground had her last name not been ""Coppola""?"
2,Nowhere,"An utterly pointless movie about a pathetic Hollywood loser and his black Ferrari. No storyline, no plot, miserable acting and cinematography that would fail Film 101. Hard to believe that this was executive produced by Francis Ford Coppola. He must have needed something for his daughter to do, as she is credited with writing and directing. A complete waste of time, except for Elle.So there's Elle Fanning, the incredibly beautiful and talented girl who plays the loser's daughter. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise depressing debacle. Her fresh smile warms the heart in every scene she is in. Nevertheless, I have to say that this film was a waste of her talents. All she really gets to do is look cute alongside her wanker dad. None of the facets of her life or her thoughts are given a chance to develop interest. You would think that Hollywood could come up with something better for her than this tripe.Five stars and Best Picture !? Unbelievable."
1,Anywhere but here.,"What a load of pretentious hooey.You know the expression it's like watching paint dry? Well, there's a scene in this movie where you are actually watching paint dry. On a guys face. And you can hear him breathing as it is drying. It's not actually paint, but it's very much a similar substance.Rather than being written by a creative woman, this looks like it was written by 3 bored 11 year old boys who are fascinated by:FerrarisStrippersSmokingBeerBeing a celebrityIf you want to watch a Ferrari drive down a road (or in circles), Stephen Dorff smoking a cigarette - the whole cigarette, or drink a beer, this is your film.Personally, I'd rather watch actual paint dry."
2,Boring..meaningless dialogue,I had high hopes for this movie despite the bad reviews. Unfortunately it was a waste of money. It wasn't the heartwarming story I expected. The dialogue and scenes b/w father and daughter are meaningless. they hardly speak and play cards and WI together. There was one emotional scene and that was it. It is extremely slow moving and there is no real dramatic finish. Save your money and do not rent this movie.
2,"Poetic, but who cares?","This is supposed to be Sophia Coppolla's attempt to translate poetry to the screen, but it ends up just silly and pointless. A major movie star is seen as empty and lonely and depressed. That's the whole thing. Only his 11 year old daughter cheers him up a bit. There's no dialogue at all for the first, I don't know, 15 minutes. That's the first clue that you are in for a bit of an ordeal here. We can't feel too sorry for this dude because he is rich, drives a fancy sports car, has naked women throwing themselves at him, and gets the best of everything wherever he goes. Still, he weeps into the phone to his estranged wife that he is a nothing. The scenes here are very pretty. The locations are interesting. It's just lacking substance. A noble failure."
2,Not Viewer Friendly,"A bittersweet, slow moving drama of an affable, wealthy, and well-meaning film star who is abandoned by his wife, discontented with his life, and anxious to provide his effervescent 11-year old daughter with some sort of parental relationship. The filming strategy is not viewer friendly however. It is characterised by brief snatches of dialogue, interspersed with long, indeterminable and tedious periods of inaction, where nothing much seems to be going on. Even on fast-forward, this potentially interesting film moves at a sluggish pace."
1,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"... and I don't necessarily hate art films, but man did this movie suck wind. Quit watching with only 20 minutes left, it was just so painfully boring."
3,Dada/Dali Like Feel,"Opening with a fixed camera on a small section of an oval track you just see a Ferrari tenuously speeding by (not very fast and on the wrong part of the track) every few seconds; every few seconds, every few seconds. OK, that tells you what's in store for the rest of the movie. Slow moving visual story that doesn't quite have a point (other than a partially distorted following of an actor about as he lives his partying, playboy, shallow sexual attempts, attention-centric life).So as a flowing visual Dada/Dali like experience it works surprisingly well. As an accurate portrayal of an actors' life it's not scripted well enough to convey a sense of believability. And, if on some other level of interpretation that was the intent of the director i.e. to be a shallow misrepresentation of a star's life - there are better ways to convey that message.We are left with an undefined ending which I suppose is consistent with the rest of the movie."
2,too fragile,"These lug nuts have a stainles steel cover over a steel lug nut. It makes them too big for the lug wrench in your car, one visit for inspection and the garage wrecked half of the nuts with an air impact wrench. the stainless covers warped and loosened. I cannot get a wrench on them to change them. I am not a happy guy."
3,Cheap but will work,"The waistband is a little scratchy and the pockets are cheaply done. I was a little disappointed that these didn't appear to be the same quality as my other pull up polyesters, but then for $12, I guess I shouldn't expect much."
5,awesome,"This book delivers a great reference to storms and the nature of storm chasers, not to mention some great photos"
3,durability is suspect,"Overall it was a decent toy. The scientific principles behind it are fascinating! I was just very disappointed that the plastic rip cord snapped within one week of play. As a result, you are relegated to using the cumbersome string. You can buy much cheaper gyroscopes, but the rip cord made this one stand out. Oh well."
3,Debt-Free Living,There are many good points in this book. Many are directed to people who would be stupid in the handling of their money. The book could address all the issues without the complete case histories. It would be a shorter read and therefore not as boring as to detail. Just state the facts and teach the subject...skip all the retoric. Suffice it to say some people have done this. Again all the points of finance and bugeting is as sound as can be.
2,"Disappointed, not as good as it should","I bought this battery mainly to power my portable fridge for camping at night when the car is not running. During the day, I plug my fridge into the 12v outlet in the back of my Honda Element. Anyway, this battery has been plugged into the wall outlet at home for over a week now. For some reason, the needle on the dial gauge can only go as far as 13.5 mark which is kind of in the middle of the ""Ready to use"" green area. The highest mark is 15 amps. This tells me the battery can not be fully charged to its capacity."
5,Very dependable!,"I worked for a police department of about 125 sworn officers. Modern squad cars are full of electronic gadgets of one type or another - some of which, when left on, slowly drain the batteries. A previous jump-starter purchases resulted in three poorly performing devices that turned out to be a waste of money.I did a little research and found the JNC950. It has been very reliable and can stay plugged into a wall socket indfinitely without degrading, as do many of the other units. I can start 10-15 cars on one charge with this device.I've been so impressed with the effectiveness of this jump starter that I went out and bought one for myself, to travel with.Roadside Assistance programs use low-bid wrecker services. Those companies will always give higher priority to ""full-pay"" clients so when the really bad weather hits you will w a i t .If you need an ""emergency"" jump start the JNC950 is far better insurance!"
5,A Diver's Cookbook,"Diving and Snorkeling in Belize is for divers - as a pictured cookbook is for hungry people... A very good source for divers, novice through advanced. The Book starts by covering some basics for every tourist to Belize, then moves on to an overview of Belize as a scuba-diver's wonder-world. Following, all sites are described explicitly. The site descriptions include easy-to-follow rankings of expertise required and characteristics, as depth, currents, visibility, etc., and directions to unique attractions in each site. Throughout, beautiful pictures enhance this coverage. The book definitely played a part in the decision to visit Belize, and for divers - is a recommended addition to the Lonely Planet reference to this region."
3,Unusual,"I know this is a strange description of a book, but it fits. Tells a strange story in a philosophical, yet romantic, way. Not sure if everything fits together, and felt it was a little drawn out. But it was compelling enough for you to read to the end to see how it all turned out."
4,Dragged Out,"I was a bit disappointed in ""Indecent Proposal"" because the storyline seemed drawn out....like the author felt there had to be X number of words in the book. The plot was interesting, however, so it kept me reading. It was hard for me to identify on an emotional level with any of the three main characters."
3,What??,"Man I was so excited for this to end well, but it just left me feeling like it wasn't finished. But overall not bad for a free kindle read."
1,Low quality,"Item did not work, part number matches working item I own. I bought 2 of these cables and both of them do not work. When i plug the cable in to a USB port and connect it to my phone *nothing* happens.I already had a working cable, and it works on the exact same setup where all I change is the cable.These cables are defective. I would call them cheap knock-off's but they have a samsung OEM sticker."
5,good gift for little ones and is useful thru many years.,"I keep a couple of eye-spy bags around as gifts for little ones. It is good to get kids working on colors, objects, sentences. (I spy something RED and have the kid point it out), Or I spy a _____ and have kid point out, etc. My educator friends love these and were suprised when my 1 year old used it as well as my 7 year old nephew. Good deal for all kids. Durable too, cleans up pretty good."
2,not what i expected,the kennel was not anywhere near the quality of crate i have purchased in the past. feels flimsy and not as secure for mygirls.
1,not good quality,This is one of the worst items I've ever purchased. It's not sturdy at all. My cat would be safer in a cardboard box than this kennel. Don't waste your money.
3,For dogs great! For Iguanas not so much..,"I am one of those crazy iguana lovers who really needed a way to transport her iguana to and fro varying places. It's ok if the iguana is not going to be in there 1 hour or more, because the carrier is not long enough for the tail to be all the way out and straight, so it's always curled around the iguana or becomeing bent at an odd angle when the iguana moves about. A recomendation I could make to the company is to make a longer or wider case so the Iguana has more room to move about. Otherwise a great carrier and probaly the best on the market right now for safe travel of iguanas.If anyone knows of something better please let me know!"
5,A REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT DECORATING BOOK,"This is a wonderful book and handles decorating your home from a refreshing perspective. Decorating should not be just about the way the sofa looks next to the fireplace, but also how you feel when you touch the fabric, how the color of the room motivates you or relaxes you, even how the house smells, how the whole effects your comfort level. Our homes are our refuge from the outside world and should be very personal and unique to ourselves. Those who do not understand this concept should get one of Martha Stewart's insipid books. This book has taught me to look at my home as a reflection of myself. Just as I do not dress to please others, from now on I will decorate my home to please only me. New home owners out there, buy this book now!"
3,Be Kind Rewind,"I was curious in seeing Jack Black in a couple of his movies. This movie was entertaining and worth many laughs. Your typical JB slapstick. Amazon gave me a free copy streamed to my computer before the hard copy ever arrived, in the form of a one-time viewing."
3,It was OK.,"This movie was cute. It had some good humor, especially when Jack Black gets 'magnetized.' But I kinda got bored.It was a simple plot- man has video store that will be torn down if he doesn't come up with enough money. While he's away, he leaves the store in Mos Def's care and after Jack Black's been magnetized he erases all the tapes, therefore the two film their version of each movie that's on the shelves, customers are demanding more of these movies because they're so much better than original and then all hell breaks loose.I liked it but it wasn't the greatest. If you like simple laughter with a good ending, well this movie should give you a good dose, but then what'll you do?"
3,Are you the key holder?,"Anyone who's ever watched a film and thought they could make the film better will love this one. While being a substantially budgeted film it has the feel of an indie flick, much like those the characters are making. The comedy is fun, the story is sweet, and it's an entertaining flashback to 80s media. It does seem to struggle between comedy and endearing human triumph, but it's a silly story through and through."
2,oh man,"I don't know WHY a movie like this was even made. Did the writers think it was a good idea for a storyline? I don't mean to sound extremely harsh but I've seen thousands of better movies than this one, and I'm not even much of a movie watcher to begin with. This was just... pointless to me.The film tried to tell a story but it didn't keep my interest. It tried to be funny and failed REALLY hard at that. In fact trying to think of a reason to even CARE about a story like this is a gigantic mind-blowing mystery to me. It's as bad as a story can possibly be.Jack Black and his movie buddies try to recreate certain parts from classic films out on the streets and in the movie store itself, and the results are horrible. I wasn't laughing and I wasn't entertained."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I had some reservations about this movie before I watched it, but I was shocked at how terrible it was. I get the feeling that this movie was put together in about a week, with about one hour of that week dedicated to writing the script. I'm sure the only money they put into the movie was to get Jack Black and Danny Glover to agree to star in something so juvenile. The only reason this was ever in theaters is due to the market for anything with Jack Black. A huge waste of time, and an insult to anyone who spent money to see it."
2,Title song not included,Big disappointment - title song not included.Bigger disappointment - none of my favorites are on the disc.The 8 tracks are:-1- Porque Te Vas-2- America-3- Quedate Conmigo-4- Me Han Contado Que Existe Un Paraiso-5- No Supo Decir No-6- Cantame-7- Amigo-8- Que Canten Los NinosTotal playing time about 33 minutes.
1,Ditto piece of junk,"Avoid this ADS Instant DVD (?) at all cost. Have tried on two computers, and the USB2 cannot be detected on either. Sorry I bought it."
4,ADS TECH INSTANT DVD +DV ( USBAV-703 ),"Easy installation. Software installs easily however you MUST use the latest software, updates and patches available onlineat www.adstech.com and www.ulead.com. Capture worked flawlessly the first time and burning to DVD went smoothly.Highly recommend this product!"
2,Self-Centered,"Although I enjoyed reading about the arc of a bookstore's life, I thought that this book was self-indulgent and self-centered in its view. A bookstore is a business, not a public service, and it is interesting that all of us here would be damned as the people who put this store out of business by choosing to buy our books from Amazon.com, rather than our local independent store.Perhaps my view is colored by my day-job, but I think that had Watson worked harder on the ""store"" half of the bookstore, she might still be in business."
2,Needs to go back ot the drawing board,"The removable strap that connects the pad to your body is not as illustrated, is poorly designed and does not work well. Also, I was led to believe that the heat control included a timer that would go off automatically after a set time. The heat control is very primitive and does not have any auto-off features. In this age of technology there is no excuse for this. Speaking from someone that has seriously burned my leg with a heating pad that took over a year to heal I would NEVER buy a heating pad that did not have a timing feature with auto-off presets."
5,"Covers All Of McCartney's Music, Charities And Everything Paul","Bill Harry thoroughly details all of McCartney's songs, records, tours, friends, pets, studios, producers and charities. It includes wonderful biographies of Linda and Heather Mills McCartney. You can learn about his many animal rights endeavors, his vegetarianism and numerous other charitable causes that he promotes. Every other Paul McCartney book is utterly incomplete. Bill Harry's comprehensive research is laudable, commendable and a must buy for any Paul McCartney fan."
4,"Sounds good & boosts performance, but...","Had this installed on my stock 1995 Z28 Camaro by my mechanic. I can notice the throttle response and it almost sounds like one of my old Holley dual feeds when I open it up. After installation, he called me over to see where the actual filter is. The filter is mounted so low that you CANNOT go through deep puddles or standing water or risk sucking in water into engine & that's never a good thing. The bottom of this filter is just above the plastic tray. But that's where it needs to be to suck in cool air. This is from the installation instructions..."" CAUTION: The Air filter has been positioned low to maximize the performance of your vehicle.Extreme care should be taken in wet conditions as excessive water in the filter can lead to engine damage."" Remember, this review is for this model for the Camaro only. Other models might not have this problem. So if you see a sign that says ROAD FLOODED turn around!"
2,two thumbs up!,i had got this toy for a birthday presnt and boy did i love it.there are a couple things you NEED to know before buying this product.first thing that the main desk where the computer is at you cant get it to stand up on carpet you have to put on tile the second thing is that you have no place to put the blendar and coffee set.the last thing is IT DOES NOT COME WITH A DOLL.when i looked at it the first time at walmart i thought it did but it does not.another thing is it is hard to get all the pieces up without something FALLING DOWN!it was so frustrating but it is fun to play with.get this toy i highly recomend it its just everything falls down(unless you are very careful)get this toy:).i hope this has been helpfull remember tell me if i was helpfull please:)have a good day.
3,"OK point and shoot camera, comes up lacking","This is a good camera, very simple to use provided you have a very big budget for batteries and not much interest in zoom features. This camera goes through two AA batteries faster than you can imagine. You have to be so steady in order to take zoomed in shots that the zoom is not very reliable. The digital zoom is simply useless."
5,A great book for beginners as well as seasoned ceramicists,"A wealth of knowledge can be found in this timeless book that covers all the major aspects of ceramics.For the novice, it covers the the world's history of ceramics. Discusses clay and glaze compositions and gives stepby step explanations of the various techniques from wheel throwing to hand building to making plaster molds forslip casting.For the advanced ceramist, there is good information of various kilns and their construction. It offers analysis ofseveral major clays, frits, and feldspars as well as other useful reference tables including some recipes forglazes from low fire to high fire.I first bought the book in '82 as a college freshman and it has proven a valuable aid ever since. It is on the top ofmy ""required reading"" list for anyone interested in getting involved with studio ceramics."
2,Like watching paint dry,"Had to have been written by someone who writes text books. For a tech manual it is extremely boring. Has the basics from beginning to end. Recipes for glazes are dated as most are lead based, but it's an old book. I paid .18 cents for and it was worth that. My other books I purchased were newer and a better investment. I find it hard to believe that the asking price for the newest version of this book would worth it. Most of the information I was looking for was nothing more than a general overview.If you get this book don't spend a bunch on it.....it's Ok at bestThe Practical Potter..Josie Warshaw was not a better overview, but it was a more interesting read, and what is not contained in the book can be looked up on the web.After the reviews I had seen on this book. I am very disappointed. There are better books available, look around."
4,Fabulous!,This was an excellent read for anyone interested in Belly Dance. Funny and well written with vivid characters. The only thing I didnt like was that the author seemed to lack confidence and kept putting herself down. That got old real fast. I do love the book and have reread it- I would definatly recommend it.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"When I first came upon this book I wrinkled my nose. Belly dancing? I don't know...I'm a 34-year-old guy who loves hockey and football...what do I care about belly dancing? Rest assured, this book is certainly more than dancing. A very entertaining read from an author who is brutally (and refreshingly) honest and funny. This is one of the few books I could really recommend to almost anyone."
3,3.5 Stars... Very Good Compilation!,"Some of the reviews have said this isnt a very impressive compilation. I would have to disagree. I have followed Def Jux for a long time, and I think this album is quite good. Yes, there are some lackluster tracks on here.. such as: Make News, Homesickness, Aquatic and Jello. Unfortunately these few that I have mentioned are practically unlistenable. But in contrast to these few poor tracks... both Aesop Rock tracks are nice, Rob Sonic's track is nice too. El-p's tracks are dope, Oxycontin 2 is a great concept track. Hangar 18 came off amazing on both songs. For the most part this album is not only good, it is great, but due to the 4 poor songs, I had to give it only 3.5 stars."
3,Laughable.,"This album isnt necessarily laughable, but one review was. The reviewer 'Aesop Rock' bit some isht from a scribble jam battle. Who was it? Oh yeah, EYEDEA. HAHA. The entire review is a bite. Other than that, this albut is a lackluster attempt at a compilation from a normally strong record lable. Murs' track was ok but nothing to be proud of. Hangar 18, C-Rayz and Aesop Rock add a little bit of flavor but, again, not enough to satisfy. Pick it up just to support Jux, or for the DVD, that's pretty dope too."
2,The Pallisers - The Complete collection,I was very disappointed in the quality of the film.Colors very poor and film viewing was awful. Verypoorly filmed. I enjoyed the contents just not theviewing. For the price it was awful.
1,Revisionist Tripe,"If you want Israeli history, stick with Sir Martin Gilbert's Israel, and avoid Segev's utter animus for the Jewish state. This animus takes things so far as to rewrite the facts as fiction. Rewarding history can also be found in the 700-page tome, The Siege by Conor Cruise, O Jerusalem by Larry Collins and Dominque LaPierre and From Time Immemorial by Joan Peters. Anything on Israel by Bernard Lewis, Anita Shapira, or Efraim Karsh is likewise leagues ahead of this nonsense."
5,"Cheng Shin, just right!","I was glad to see it matches the back tire perfectly.If this tire has the same quality as my back tire,it will surely last for a very long time."
3,i like it,"of course the color you get not same as on box. If hair is natural black, color will be orange at first then in a week or so color will adjust. If trying to cover grey will need to leave on for the maximum time allowed. The shipping cost is exaggerated and can be duly avoided by a simple local purchase if able"
5,Fabvulous,I bought it for one concert that I had on VHS and wanted it on DVD and got another concert with it that is even better than the one I originally wanted. I'd recommend it to all Streisand fans.
1,Flimsy and falsely advertised,"I received this balloon yesterday (the shipping was prompt, as promised). Even though the description mentioned that it contains or comes with helium, there was no helium. It was not inflated--just folded into an envelope.I took it to Party City where it proceeded to explode. The worker told me that mylar balloons are not supposed to rupture that easily--they are supposed to have a mechanism that prevents them from being overfilled. So this balloon is definitely not well made. Definitely wouldn't buy again."
1,never used it,it just wasn't real user friendly. kinda bulky and inefficient. way to big for a newborn to be propped up on.
4,strangely compelling,"I can't say what attracted me to this book. Having read it, I can't quite put my finger on why I found it such a pleasure. It has a dark underbelly and a lingering menace which simmers in the back of one's mind. Magnus Mills has a real talent and I look forward to watching him nurture that talent in future novels."
4,Fence Posts...,"The matter of fact absurdity of life looms large in this novel. Life is a ludicrous experience, of course! Especially when you're a fencer stuck in a caravan in Scotland.Mills reveals the true nature of his characters with a good humoured frankness and understatement. The repititious minutae of the narrator's life continues until it becomes like a hilarious rythmic nightmare. I felt like it was nothing when I started but like a hamster on wheel I just felt compelled to keep going. The bits of carrot at the end of the stick are the hilarious/honest minor variations to the days and nights of the characters and they're the kind of variations that definately make life interesting but don't usually cut it in novels. But with the help of three characters who work hard-ish, drink very hard and think small Mills manages it.Although ... on another note ... I have to admit the ending is a little out of whack and uneccesary."
1,Lame Duck Booker Prize finalist,"There is not much to say about this book except don't believe the hype. It is a dull read with one dimensional characters, bad dialogue and a hackneyed job of plot construction. As to comments that this book is Kafkaeque due to its ""dark"" noirish overtones. Wrong. Kafka's works inspired fear and dread about society's compassionless bureaucracy and inhuman conspiracy to sacrifice certain members. The Restraint of Beats inspires nothing, except a desire to read real writers like Kafka."
4,Good sense of humour and easy reading,"I loved it.. it was amusing and had the occasional unexpected moment. I read the entire book in 4 hours and was quite enthralled by it. It certainly stopped me thinking about other things as I concentrated on the characters and wondered how they would end the novel. If you're british, read it!"
3,Original but overrated,"This is the first time I have bought a book, purely for its Booker credentials. I would have to admit to being a little disappointed. On the plus side, Magnus Mills manages to create a build up of quite real suspense using simple, skin-deep characters indulging in repetitive and often meaningless activity and dialogue. On the minus side, the story really doesn't get anywhere and ends disappointingly. This is not always a problem but, in this case, it made me reappraise characters, plot and dialogue and find all wanting. Mills could have done more with the characters he'd created and the situation he'd got them into. His ending was a cop-out."
2,Save Your Money,"I thought I'd take a chance since I was able to get the disk for 9.99. These are identified as widescreen and I've never seen widescreen before where the bar was totally on the bottom, but oh well. The quality of the transfer is about the same as the 50 movies for 19.99 collections which when you're paying less that 50 cents a movie is okay, but not at 6 bucks per film. The movies are awful, the dubbing is unbelievable. This is going into the stack to take to the local store that buys used DVDs. I assume that the others in the collection are equally bad. These aren't even worth renting."
2,second time around,"On rereading ""Clara Reeve"" after many years, I was sorely disappointed. In fact I was unable to finish it. The contrivance of a semi-Victorian semi-Gothic novel did not enthrall me this time around. Villainous fortune hunters, sexual ambiguity, people falling or jumping into Vesuvius don't cut it any more. Similar patterns in James' ""Portrait of a Lady"" stand the test of time very well. As I grow older and return to reread books from my youth, I often find myself wondering why I found the book in question so captivating. Of course sometimes I'm overwhelmed again (e,g., ""Till We Have Faces"" and ""Shadowlands"" by C.S. Lewis and ""The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel"" by Nikos Kazantzakis,""On the Nature of Things"" by Lucretius and even ""The Sword in the Stone"".)There are too many books and too little time to spend any of it on books which fail at their task."
2,It's not the book the title implies,"This book should been titled ""Studio Lighting Theory"". While I appreciate the theory and concepts described in the book, I was looking for BASIC STUDIO LIGHTING instruction, and this book does not deliver. There are many, many nicely lighted portraits and product shots in this book but they are like teasers...""Try and figure out how I lighted this one!"" In another review of the book, the reviewer considers the lack of diagrams a plus, but I surely can't see how holding back information can be beneficial.I suspect, this was just a money grab by the author. A collection of his photographs--most of which he may not even remember the lighting setup used. The book is a bit dated, too, with nothing but film references and no fluorescents even mentioned in the continuous lighting section.If you are looking for an introduction to studio lighting, this book will disappoint. I suggest looking elsewhere. That's what I'm doing now."
5,Loved it!,"A friend loaned me Son of the Morning. We share books often, but neither of us had ever traded romance novels. I was surprised when she gave it to me. I thought I'd ""outgrown"" romance novels, but I was wrong! It was the first L.H. book I ever read, and I absolutely loved it! It inspired me to read other L.H. books (Shades of Twilight, Lady of the West, Touch of Fire), but Son... is still my favorite. It it a satisfying combination of romance, steamy love scenes, history, and suspense (not necessarily in that order). I couldn't put it down.My second favorite L.H. novel (so far) is A Lady of the West. Very different from Son... but very good.I haven't read a romance novel this great in a long time. I'm inspired to drag out my old Beatrice Small novels ;-)."
2,Not really a romance novel,"*Spoiler Alert*Hmmm. Where do i start with this review. I picked up this book based on all the 5 star reviews but i was disappointed. The book was focused on Grace the heroine and the hero only came in at the end. The first half of the book focused on Grace's struggle and i kept wandering when the hero was going to feature in the book. For the most part i had to skim through most of the first half because there were too many boring details.It is also strange that after a few weeks of loosing her husband, Grace was already having sex with someone else. Even when Grace finally met the hero it seemed more about lust than love. I also didn't quite get what the treasure was. Overall it was an ok book if i was not expecting romance but it was a fail if i was expecting romance (which i was)."
2,*yawn*,"Quite honestly, this was the only LH novel I had to FORCE myself to finish reading. The beginning dragged on with repetitive info that really didnt seem all that important to the plot. I've read some of the glowing reviews here, I don't agree with most. Yes, it IS a soso read ( not great ) compared to other romance-thriller authors but it is not up to par with LH's talent in this genre. In no way would I consider this book a romance novel ( not even small amount ) so compare a normal thriller author with this... then I would consider this book ""horrible"", since it never through out the book capture my attention with anything but boredom. Frankly, it was dull... *sigh* The romance I looked forward to didnt come til the last 100pg ( or less) of the book. It seemed rushed, not very emotional... so, overall.. if you're grabbing this book for romance, grab something else, if you're looking for heart pounding action... this book isnt for you either."
2,"Just OK, barely adequate","These tools are are not black but are actually chrome.They seem to be below average in quality and don't fit well. They are also quite short but would be OK for replacements in a compact on-board emergency kit if you were selling the bike. One of them wiped out a screw on my beemer due to a wobbly fit. You can do better than these for the same money. I recommend the the flip style, as it fits in more places. I hope the rest of Cruztools products are superior to these."
3,Great moments mixed with horrible moments,"As with so many double albums, this good be edited down to an incredible single album. ""Christmas"", ""The Acid Queen"", ""Pinball Wizard"", ""Tommy, Can You Hear Me?"", ""Sally Simpson"", ""We're not Going to Take It"", ""I'm Free"", and ""Welcome"" rank with the best songs the Who ever did, but some of the other stuff is just crap and filler trying to fill in the blanks on the story. The story is really quite stupid (read a novel if you want a story). This is far superior to the Soundtrack as the Who do a better job with these songs than the guests in the movie. If you're a novice to the Who, then start with ""Who's Next"" and ""Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy"" and ""Quadrophenia"" before you try this one. However, this is worth owning, just for ""I'm Free."" Just use the program button on your CD player liberally."
2,"the real ""who sell out album""","Believe your ears people. This is NOT revolutionary, in fact its quite boring. With the exception of about five songs, this entire recording is worthless. The Who dropped their trashy, punk sound and cleaned up their image, and, hence, increased their popularity. I, personally, hate Tommy and everything after. For a tollorabe concept album, I'd stick with the Kink's ""Village Green..."" or ""Arthur."""
3,a little disappointed,"Tommy was just done brilliantly by the Little Theatre of Alexandria in Virginia, and I enjoyed it immensely, several times. Hoping to buy a CD of the music they used, I bought this one. Immediately I was disappointed. Most of the songs are sung by the entire band, rather than the individual characters singing as in the staged version, and it lost a lot by comparison. I know that this was the original album, and credit the band for creating this great music, but definitely prefer the newer stage version as I saw it performed so wonderfully. I hope to find a CD available that is closer to that ideal..."
5,Tommy + SACD 5.1 = a wonderful experience,"Well Worth it. If you have a SACD player/5.1 channel system, you will LOVE this recording. AMAZING sound!! i am not reviewing the content ,per se, if you have ever heard Tommy, then you already like the album or not, for those who complain about 5.1 mixes, and how they differ from the original stereo LP, hey, if you see a group live, alot of times they dont play songs the same anyway, so if it seems too different from the original, chalk it up to artistic interpetation, the original artists probably approved or arranged the new 5.1 mixes anyway. The only way to listen to SACDs is with the proper setup, The Playstation 3 will play them if you get the proper receiver, one that decodes LPCM thru the HDMI cable, see ps3sacd.com for receivers that work, otherwise, get a SACD stand alone player and a 5.1 receiver/amp, see ebay, and ENJOY!!!!"
2,don't expect to fold it,"If you can keep your bench set up, then no big deal, but don't expect to fold it and slide into the closet. When I got it, i had to get my husband to insert the pins, because it doesn't line up. It took quite a bit of force to get the pins in and they cannot be easily removed. I complained about it to the vendor who contacted the manufacturer. the manufacturer claims that this is the way it is supposed to be."
4,cell phone case,I got this for my daughter to protect her phone from scratches since she is not so gentle with her phone. Drops it a lot
5,Beautiful,This was given as a gift at a baby shower and she loved it. It was sooo soft. I would recomend this for anyone who is having a baby or who has a baby this is great.
4,Teases & Dares Re-issue,Teases & Dares by Kim Wilde quality is amazing while sounding vibrant. Comparing the new sound to my original old album the sounds is so flat. Hope they do something about Kim's remaining releses between 1990-1994 soon to be re-issued because they bore the hell out of me their so FLAT. I regreted buying those 1990-1994 used Cd's 2yrs. ago. I don't listen to them anymore.Reviewed by Desiree LaVey
1,very poor copy,"For pretty much the same story, similar characters with the same powers, aliens species with the same names, same problems for the hero, same equipment, same opponent, ect...Read the Baen book Hero(ISBN#0-7434-8827-X)published about a year earlieranother reader gathered up the particulars, so I will use their post for this.An alien race in DP : IndowyThe main character is an outsider who joins a human Deep Recon Team (DRT)The main character is psychic.he main character is incapable of killing.The main character uses a 'punch gun'The DRT infiltrates an alien held planet.The enemy aliens are nicknamed 'blobs'An ancient artifact is found, called a 'lindl'The main character must fight one of his team members, a sniper, for possessionof the artifact.read the copy, or read the original, by Mike Williamson. Also, in the original, there is an entire series that has many of the books available at the publishers website in full, for free."
4,Simple meditations,"This is a meditative book that walks you through different aspects of a single day, and what beauty can be found in it. The sections are brief, but poignant. I found it best to only read a section at a time and reflect on it. This would have been great as a journal to add in your own reflections. If you enjoy this book, ""Simple Truths"" by this auther is even better."
5,Beautiful and Simple,I have worn these chandelier Earrings to several occasions. So simple and elegant. I have gotten many compliments on them. It's so versatile you can wear it just about any where. It looks great with your hair up or down.
1,Never got it working,"After trying to load the software several times, switching computers, and trying several options, I couldn't get this to work. I finally returned it (no shipping charges thanks to Amazon) and instead bought the Adaptec VideOh! USB 2.0 DVD Video Converter Kit which worked perfectly right out of the box."
2,Not even close to be stable,I got an ADS DVD Express rev 2 and the CapWiz freezes a lot. It is not temperature related problem but seems to be related to image quality. When your tape has a noisy clip changes it gets hosed at the same transition points. The only way to recover is manually delete the task. The file that was storing the video has to be deleted by a console window because win2000 gets also hosed by the bad file (not closed properly by CapWiz.I have the latest drivers as well as a huge fan over the DVD Express with its PCB exposed.Those guys should never release a product having such a poor quality.
5,Replacement,This was a replacement for a damaged book for a friend. It arrived ahead of schedule and was well packaged. Thanks.
1,Badly researched,"I just wanted to say that the author of this book has no idea what he is talking about as far as the history of terrorism is concerned. He makes assertions with no credible evidence to back them up and turns complicated and controversial issues into oversimplified school-room exercises with his black and white ""us vs. them"" mentality. Do yourself a favor and read someone who knows what they are talking about."
2,"Bland, Unintersting, but thankfully short.","The story from this book is like reading an actual Dungeons and Dragons game. It's very straightfoward and reads like a D&D adventure. I enjoyed it for the most part because I play D&D and just like to read anything about it.However, T.H. Lain has got some real work to do if he ever wants to be a real author. The story is not written well at all. Some of the conversations between the characters are laughable - and not the ones that are supposed to be humorous. There are parts where I had to re-read paragraphs because his writing style just lost me. It's not really a writing style, more of a lack of writing skills.If you want a fair quick read, go ahead and pick it up... otherwise there are tons of other great fantasy books to read that are much much better."
4,Short and sweet!,Short and sweet! That's what I liked about this book. I felt he captured the personalities of the characters and he didn't make an epic novel of it! Easy and fun to read! And... (I actually stole a few ideas for my own D&D campaign!)I recommend it!
3,Good for the youngsters...,"It's not that the book was bad, because it wasn't. It was a fine book to read, exciting and all that. Yet, as it was probably meant for the teen and younger audience, was completly devoid of the elements that make a great book: character devolpment, intricate plot, etc. Then again, I didn't expect it to. So, if you feel like picking up a book and just reading, go ahead and read this. If you are young, and new to Dungeons and Dragons, go ahead and read this. If you are looking for a top-of-the-line book like R.A. Salvatore's, don't read this."
3,Very hard to turn into Gotham City,"The toy itself as a car is great. My 5 year old runs it around all the time ramming it in to things and it is very durable. However, when you try to turn it into Gotham City it becomes a bit of a challenge for everyone. First there is no lever that we could find that lets the middle pop down, so you have to literally fight with it to get the latch to let go. This is a fight for the adulta as well as the children. Second there are these chains that you have to latch to the floors of the city and the hooks to attach the chains too are so small you have to really work at it to get them to go in. My 5 year old gets very frustrated when he tries to turn it into the city and most of the time just plays with the car part. It was a bit disappointing for him because thie was the toy he REALLY wanted for Christmas and it turned out not to be what he thought."
1,Waste of time and money!,"Please don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk.It falls apart constantly and does not stand still while playing. Plus the platform on top does not hold many of the Batman figures. I have purchased 4 action figures and none of them fit on top, so the platform is completely useless. My son who is 4 gets frustrated because the accessories come apart and the city falls back. It is not sturdy. Very disppointing toy! NOT WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY !!!"
4,Good read,"Even if you think you know everything, this book gives some great advice about women that alot of men have heard about but don't really follow along. Maybe for those men out their it could be some good advice that we really are different and what we want in love making isn't what they want. If anything it's a good read!"
5,He was a believer...,"...and after his research as a respected neuroscientist, published this book as overwhelming evidence for his disbelief in the ""disordered brain biochemistry"" theory of mental illness.HIGHLY recommended.Charles Whitfield MDauthor of The Truth about Depression& The Truth about Mental Illness"
1,"Horrible, horrible product","I use this switch with a Windows XP machine and a G5 Power Mac running OS X 10.3.8. I chose not to install the software that would enable hotkey switching since the included software is Windows-only. The only way you can switch from a Mac with this switch is by using the manual button on the switch. So I can't speak to any software issues -- all I'm trying to do is plug the thing in and try to press the button to switch from one computer to the other.The product behaves erratically, switching between computers at random while I'm working. Most of the time, the button does not respond or will switch from computer 1 to computer 2 but immediately switch back. It is completely useless. It looks nice and it would be great if it performed as advertised, but it has not worked at all for me."
3,Works ok after some fiddling,"Initial installation worked fine, both mouse and display were switched w/o any problem, but my Compaq Desktop keyboard was not recognized by my laptop after switching. Upgrading the laptop BIOS and installing correct keyboard drivers fixed this issue.It's strange that the product documentation does not contain information about hot key support: pressing Scroll Lock 4 times in a row will switch - an important undocumented feature. Thanks to ""JustMe"" for pointing this out!The other thing I don't like is the Audio support cables: If I plugin the USB cable into the back of my laptop docking station, the audio cables are not long enough to reach the front, where audio ports are located. Fortunately, audio support is only a minor requirement for me.Switching time for me is about 3 seconds, which is kind of what I expected to get.Overall, 3 stars ..."
1,Major Disappointment,"We sent the phone back the same day we received it. It looked beautiful, but unfortunately, we wanted it to funtion as well. YOu could anwser and talk on the phone , but he ringer did not work at all. We tried all the steps that the directions gave but to no avail.To bad."
2,Cheesey Disappointment!,Just received the phone in black. Sending it back immediately! As soon as it came out of the box I could tell the product is cheap and poorly made. Cheap plastic. The receiver feels like a toy in my hand. Not like the Crosley wall unit we bought about 6 years ago which was made out of metal. The receiver on that phone feels almost like a hammer. Very disappointed.
2,Looks good but...,"This phone is smart looking and goes well with my decor but it doesn't ring and I'm going to have to send it back after I call to get my shipping label to return it, repack it and wait for return... its such a hassle. I would like to recommend this phone to a friend but I'm afraid it may not ""ring"". This is a pretty important feature."
2,wire missing from phone,"I purchased the phone for a gift. When my sister opened the box she realized that the wire was missing. Please send me the wire. I was embarassed to give a gift that she could not use.Thank you,Catherine B."
2,is this a joke?,"This cd needs songs such as Goldfinger's ""Here in Your Bedroom"" or Coolio's ""Gangsta's Paradise"" to be good."
1,Did not get what I ordered,"I ordered this Christmas Welcome Jigsaw Puzzle six weeks before Christmas. I was sent the wrong puzzle titled something like, Winter Friends, and it arrived two days before Christmas, much later than promised, and too late to exchange it before Christmas. The cost to return the puzzle was almost the price I paid for the puzzle so I was stuck with a puzzle I didn't want. I was not pleased."
4,Narration & Special Meditation by T. Lobsang Rampa,"I have the original casette tape purchased in the 1990's which also has meditation music on one side of the tape. Lobsang Rampa also gives a review of his background which was quite interesting. I am wondering why, if both tape and CD are entitled the same, they do not present the same info."
3,Pretty Dessert Stand,Pretty dessert display. The decorative metal bends easily (bends back too). Served it's purpose. This is a large piece that takes up quite a bit of room when you store it but is very pretty!
5,It's just great!,"I got it by chance, searching for the song ""I got you babe"" with UB40. Yet it came to be an excellent choice and a real masterpiece. All the songs you'd ever want from Pretenders are there.I do recommend it..."
4,wow,"okay people, four words: i'll stand by you. i think that is one of the most beautiful songs ever. i also really like back on the chain gang. i like these songs because they are realistic, yet so beautiful. and also really strong. they can express longing, but self reliance at the same time (as i see it.) anyhow i wish there were more songs like that nowadays. especially by female artists. take a hint britney, christina: if you use up all your sex appeal all at once then you will burn out and have nothing left."
4,Nice Reminder of Hynde's Potency,"In my mind, Chrissie Hynde has always been somewhat overrated in the whole scheme of the music scene. Granted, she's a first-rate vocalist, and she's written several very classic tunes('Back On The Chain Gang','Don't Get Me Wrong'), but on both counts, she's really no better than any number of equally talented rock women. Still, one spin of GREATEST HITS at least puts me in closer proximity with the more popular mass opinion. The typical hits are here, along with several other very strong reminders of Hynde's considerable appeal(a superb cover of Dylan's 'Forever Young', as well as criminally underrated latter-day gems 'Night In My Veins' and 'Human'). All in all, a pretty complete summation of the group's work so far, and further proof that Hynde more often than not, it would seem, lives up to all the hype."
1,"Great band, highly overated singer","Too bad this competent band has such a highly overated singer in Chrissie Hynde. As a musician, I don't understand the juvenile attraction to her. She's not a good singer (poor intonation) and just so-so as a song writer. But I guess it's symptomatic of our the lessened standards in America."
3,interesting book with many flaws...,"i listened to the mp3 audio book version.it's definitely an interesting book with a good plot. the main character is quite likable and i sympathize with him. a man as a CEO who has to reduce the work force in a Michigan city isn't a position everyone wants to be in. in addition he is faced with a murder at the beginning of the book... the ending is a little unexpected...it has many flaws though... first the writing feels kine of childish... too often the author tried to create a real-life environment for the reader but his effort, at least too me, often fails miserably... i feel he was also writing for a cinema scene... I didn't know fully understand why the father had to mutter 'no hiding place' when facing the gun at the beginning of the book. the main character, though likable, often behave so stupidly that almost made me hate him... all this said, this was still an interesting book to me as it kept my attention."
5,Great reading,Joseph Finder's fans will love this one. I also think it's his best to date. The story moves fast and pulls you in at the same time. A well written suspenseful thriller well worth your time.Highly recommended.
5,Another Page Turner,"Company Man is the type of book anyone will enjopt. From the opening page you are captivated, and like Paranoia, unable to put the book down. Joseph Finder has emerged as a writer whose books are not to be missed."
1,Stick to your day job...,"I do not know what school of music the creator of this CD came from, but I would avoid it at all cost. I suppose this CD is just another example of how some people will do anything to pretend to be a star."
2,Not instant read!,"This thermometer is not instant read! It may be as instant as less expensive thermometers get, but that isn't necessarily saying much. If you want a thermometer that's instant enough to make it worth having a hand-held thermometer, go with the Thermapen thermometers. They're more expensive but they are the actual instant read thermometers. If your ""instant read"" thermometer involves you either holding your hand in the oven/grill for 15-20 seconds, or removing the food from the oven anyway, why not just use a regular old meat thermometer?We returned this thermometer, so I can't review how it holds up."
1,Yawn,"As with Duncan-Jones's biography of Sidney, her strength is her imagination. A book, like so many other 'Shakespeare biographries', that belongs on the 'fiction' shelf."
3,remote doesn't work after battery replacement,"It is incomvenient ot have to switch the home station from inside to outside. other weather stations report both at the same timeI have hust replaced the battery in the remote sensor and it has not hooked up with the base station. It had been working well.UV sensor seems to work well, but it is hard to find a place that is constantly in the sun."
2,Unhappy with substitutions for order,"i ordered 5 1000 piece puzzles with my gift certificate. On one of them ( grand canyon by national landmarks the 550 piece was substituted, but not in price but list included with shipping said it was 1000 piece). It is too much trouble to send back and get what I ordered. [...].Peace, Kathy McGill"
2,Weakest yet.,"(1976) I must be listening to something different than the other 19 reviewers, i just find this one of their most unlistenable albums. They do have strong songs in ""Mother Of Pearl"" and ""Lorelei"" with a passable number in ""Runaway"". The band had a rough 1976, but things were about to change. 1977 gave us ""Front Page News""."
3,"Great reference, small variety","Unless you happen to still paste up keyline boards and need clip art to literally ""clip out"", the Dover Ready-to-Use books offer less images for the price. They're printed on slick, hard paper with nothing on the back of the page. I discovered that half of the same images were available in my other Dover reference books of similar themes. The picture variety spans a broad spectrum of the Middle Ages and Renaissance with lots of etchings and the occasional celtic knot. It's a good reference, just limited."
3,Does the trick,I had lost my cable for a Sony portable boombox. This fits and the boombox works. It tends to come off more easily than the original cord but it works good enough for the price.
4,Power Cord,"This was purchased when my tivo quit working. I thought it the power cord needed to be replaced. However, even after I bought the new cord it still didn't work. I ended up using the cord on another device and it works great."
1,poor quality,"These items are of very poor quality and the seller is very belligerent, I needed new cords for my PS3 and Cable box. Cords are thin, and heated up. not what they say they are"
1,unhappy,"this power cord was not what I ordered there is no purchase order with the shipment or any information that I might be able to send this back. I am now stuck with a power cord I didn't order, don't want and have no use what so ever for it. I called with a defective kindle power cord which I still have and am still trying to use. Believe me none of this is worth the time and trouble I have had to doLochad@aol.com"
3,A Disappointingly Dull Detective,"This is the first of Zubro's many books that I have read, and sorry to say it will be the last also. I love gay mystery as a genre, but this book disappointed on many levels. The plot, about the murder of a bigotted televangelist's daughter, and the gay community's possible involvement as a means of revenge undoubtedly has potential, but isn't developed, with the result that I didn't really care how the book ended. Undoubtedly the biggest let down is the quality of the writing. It's pedestrian and leaden, making the promising idea of the central character, a gay cop and father a crashing bore."
5,Catholicism on Parade,"Word On Fire's recent production of Catholicism, narrated by Fr. Robert Barron is a wondeful series. We are studying it at our parish, and I ordered the series so I could see the episodes again. This is a beautiful exposition of the Catholic Church and its beliefs. I would think most Catholics would find the production enjoyable, informative and interesting. Others who may be interested in what Catholicism is all about would enjoy it as well. I'm very glad I made this purchase."
2,Grandiose,"This is a well-received series with serious positive endorsements. I know people impressed by it. I expected much and was disappointed. Neither my wife nor I liked it, thus two stars: ""I don't like it."" So, I feel like the ""odd man out"" among reviewers.Entitling this series ""Catholicism"" is grandiose. It does not come near to presenting the faith in its fullness. The scenery and settings are often stunning, but often the presentation of the faith is not particularly deep. Sometimes it's unctuous. The blurb for the the final CD says ""Father Barron presents the Catholic vision of death, judgment, heaven, hell and purgatory as he journeys to Florence, Ireland and Rome."" Really? I watched the CD but somehow missed his in depth treatment of The Four Last Things."
4,Catholicism reminds one why we worship.,"An informative explanation of both well known and more obscure truths and traditions of the Church. It is presented in an exciting, but factual manner by a good narrator/ author. I believe that it is ideal for anyone who is involved in RCIA or any fallen-away Catholics, in that it may remind them of what is good about the Church."
4,last disk is damaged,"I ordered this set, and absolutely love it. The only problem is it was sold as NEW, and was not new. The last disk on prayer is damaged and skips and stops for the first 15 minutes of the program. It's a shame. Paid almost $100.00 for this item, and would expect all DVD's to be in perfect condition if sold as NEW."
5,Catholicism DVD set,"Great Christmas gift for my daughter's large family. Informative, easy to understand and very timely especially for Catholics who don't know alot about their church and for anyone interesting in understanding it."
5,Excellent DVD Series,"Excellent presentation of the Catholic faith. Fr. Barron is engaging as he very simply explains the fundamental beliefs of Catholics, often first raising misconceptions and misunderstandings and then addressing the issue. He does this against a backdrop of some of the most beautiful and sacred Catholic places around the world. The beautiful music also enhances the DVD. I'd recommend this to long time faithful Catholics as a refresher for mind and spirit, fallen away Catholics who may not know what they've left, anyone considering converting to Catholicism, and for all who want to better understand the beliefs of their Catholic friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc."
5,Awesome set!,"This set of DVDs is a must have for the church or school library. It would also be wonderful to view at home for your own education about the Catholic faith. It is well done, the scenery is breath taking, and the teaching is insightful, entertaining and informative. Father Barron is very easy to listen to."
1,I want 6 hours of my life back,Very disapointed. Wendy Darling has no future as a writer. I think Storm made a mistake by letting her add her literary nonesense.
2,Not Much Room,"Although this is a cute suitcase for toddlers, it is way too SMALL. I decided to keep it for my granddaughter to use for her doll clothes since it would cost almost as much to send it back. Picture definitely appears larger than actual product."
5,Was everything they said it was.,My husband loves this nailer and has used it often since he recieved it for Christmas. Does everything he needs it to do from baseboards to fixing trim around the house.
2,barely so -so,"Well, it will keep you dry but that's about it. If you roll around when you sleep like I do, this is worthless as it will roll right along with your sleeping bag. Getting in or out of this bivy is also very difficult."
5,Inspirational Book,"I find this book full of inspiration and ideas. It is helpful when you get stuck in a rut to help get you out! The different layouts with the same designs are helpful to get your brain moving and to do your own thing. It is not meant to copy, just to inspire you to open up and do more. It is not a step by step book for you to mimic and I appreciate that. I don't want to see the how to, just the ideas so I can use my own talents. I am looking forward to getting the other book in the series to see what other ideas they have."
3,This book is really good! It kept me on the edge of my seat!,Coral and Jace realize their love and Jace goes on a mission to find Gem. This book is well written and inspiring.
3,Nice train but wrong set,"Don't confuse the ""Take Along Thomas"" with the ""Wooden Railway"" set as I did. ""Take Along"" is medal with a narrower guage track than the ""Wooden Railway"" set."
5,Mama of a Thomas fanatic!,We've had these cars a little over a year now and my son plays with them daily.... they are used and abused as much as any 4 year old can! He mainly has the thomas take along series because of the pricing and the construction - they can survive much longer than the wooden cars!
4,"SEASON THREE, EPISODE FOUR","The fourth episode of this third season, DOUBLE EXPOSURE, was broadcasted on Dec. 16th, 1973. It's also possible to watch this episode in the DVD standard by purchasingColumbo - The Complete Third Season. AfterColumbo Collector's Edition: Dagger Of The MindandColumbo Collector's Edition: Requiem For A Falling Star, this is the third Columbo episode directed by famous director Richard Quine. It's also, afterColumbo Collector's Edition: Death Lends A Handand THE MOST CRUCIAL GAME, the third time Robert Culp impersonates the criminal in the serie.In this episode, Lt. Columbo must confound Dr. Bart Keppel who, during the projection of a commercial short film, murdered Vic Norris. Columbo, in front of an adversary specialized in the study of consumer habits, will have to use the same arms than Keppel to expose him.A VHS to keep in your library."
1,A BOOK DETAILING ONE OF THE GREATEST PYRAMID SCEMES IN NA?,"Having been a long time PPL ASSOCIATE, I can honestly say that I am disgusted to see a book chronicling the life of this man. PPL is one of the longest running PYRAMID SCHEMES in North America. A company made up of associates that I have personally seen commit IDENTITY THEFT! A company comprised of a large group of BRAINWASHED new associates and the puppet masters that control them.I have evidence of several SEC violations that have sustained PPL'S inflated stock price and any semblance of a legitimate business. PPL is a worthless, hollow service that has destroyed many lives. IF YOU ARE EVER CONTACTED RUN AWAY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, YOU COULD LOSE A TON AND INVEST IN A COMPLETELY WORTHLESS SERVICE.-A PPL 17 YEAR INSIDER."
3,Monica's life!!,This book is ok. Its about monicas life and how she came to be a famous body builder.
1,Don't Even Bother.,"In concept, this is a really cool device. It has a big, beautiful screen, it's fast, and it has lots of great features. Unfortunately it falls short in its primary purpose: taking good pictures. I was very disappointed in the picture quality of this camera. The pictures were very noisy, and many were out of focus. Even photos taken in bright sunlight came out blurry. I compared the pictures taken with this camera to ones I took with my Canon Powershot A75, and the Canon pictures were consistently better. I really wanted to like this camera because it's a really cool design and it has a great user interface. I had to return it because the picture quality is not that great."
3,"Not good, not bad","I bought this camera on Amazon and had it for a week now. I don't know if this is a problem because I have not had many cameras to compare it to, but the flash comes on broad daylight. The pictures appear a level darker than it should be. Because the flash comes on on broadday light, I try to turn off the flash but the red hand (blur warning) keeps appearing to notify me that the picture will be blurry. I don't think I can use this camera without the flash on at all times. I thought Nikon makes one of the best cameras, maybe this one is a boo boo."
2,"""Swan Lake"" Ballet Music","While the clarity of the CD was fine, the order in which the music/scenes was presented appeared to be out of sync with how the actual ballet flows. There was too much ""extra"" music which I had never before heard and made the ballet seem disjointed. I am not pleased with this CD but do not want to spend more money on another version."
5,good value priced blade,"If you can find one of these, it is a good value for the money. Works nice for replacing those cheap, rough blades that tend to come with new miter saws. It is not in the same class as the higher end blades, but it is also 1/4 of the price. I am a trim carpenter and have used this blade for a couple months daily before it needed sharpening, should last much longer for home owner type use."
5,forgotten classic,"To supplement the other review: This group was also big at the University of Maryland where I saw them live. Life's too Short was their signature song. It shared one thing with the Kingsmen's classic, Louie, Louie in that it was thought to have an obscenity in the middle of it. Whatever the words are, it is a great song! Can probably find it on a compilation, though, for a lower price."
1,IT MADE ME SICK!!,"I can't believe I chose this horrible movie over Underdog. I was lucky that I got it at a discount, but nevertheless wasted my hard earned cash on this! The Clique is not only stupid, but also down right bad. girls who are under 18 should not be watching this. Parents who are very cautious about what DVD they get for their kids (boy or girl) would agree with me that The Clique should be on the ""DO NOT GET"" list. For parents who have any daughters under the age of 13 or 14, DON'T GET THIS MOVIE!! instead, get something like Roxy Hunter, or any American Girl movie. Oh did I mention that some of the movie was disgusting? yes. disgusting. I'd rather not get into the details. All I'm just saying is Don't Get This Movie. I guarentee you will regret it. I got this movie and I'm living to regret it. If I had to choose, I'd rather watch something dunb like The Invisible. In my opinion, The Clique should be rated R."
3,"I love Robert Fuller, not a great singer.. but it's HIM, so I like it","I have loved Robert Fuller since being a young girl. I always watched Laramie (he was my Jess Harper) and then Wagon Train (as Cooper Smith)after he took Robert Horton's place. Also in Emergency. His speaking voice has always been wonderful (Budweiser commercials) .. but he's not a great singer. I'd rather watch him dance I think?.. or dance WITH.. him. ..Gee, maybe sing along with him, too. ..LOL... Just added to my collection of dvds and Laramie tapes and magazines from years ago.. He was a big hit in Germany (westerns & Marshal arts) so he was asked to sing! ** It really wasn't music to my ears or anything. I found a few tunes I really did like, though."
1,Rife Book Bombs,Poorly written. Disorganized. No new information. Not worth the time it takes to read it... or the price.
4,Good F&S - but the first live show is worth finding...,"Longtime F&S; fan (an English woman introduced me to their work in 1992) and flew to London in early 2001 to see this show live at the Hammersmith Odeon. Some hilarious sketches but a Jennifer and Dawn perhaps a little too much of ""stars"" at this stage in their careers, and lacking the originality (and downright silliness, which I love!) of their earlier work.Certainly a must-have for an F&S; follower, but unlike the other reviewer, I'm a bigger fan of the 1990 live show. That show featured great sketches from the 3rd series (one of their best) and the inimitable Simon Brint and Rowland Rivron as Raw Sex. Couldn't ask for more, frankly!!"
2,Locker Room,"The John Steinbeck novella, ""Of Mice and Men"", was depressing and boring. I did not agree with the mentality of the characters, nor did I agree with everyone in my 8th grade class liking Lennie. Although he is sweet and has the sense of a young child, he still is a destrucitve force in the world and, although he is slighty retarted, he is insane. Steinbeck shows us this when Lennie waits for George in the brush and starts talking to his dead Aunt Clara and a huge rabbit. I have nothing against retared or insane people, but how could you like him? He kills things, wether on accident or not. Also, I found the ""Locker Room"" mentality kind of distrubing. Yes, people in locker rooms do talk that way, but, I think that is was wrong for the book. All the swearing and talking of whorehouses were all alittle too real. When I read I want to get away from the world, not read about it!"
1,Rather misleading title...,"I'd pulled up ""Of Mice and Men"" titles, compared all the prices, and selected the one that was the most economical. I tend to read the top paragraph... NOWHERE did it say this was a ""Max Notes"" or ""Cliff's Notes"" version... I went back later, and found it way at the bottom. Put it in the title!"
4,Excellent deal!,"For the price, this is a wonderful little device. It is accurate and repeatable. It comes with a short but fairly comprehensive manual (there is some sort of conversion chart on the back which I have not been able to decipher yet and is not covered). The manual has some odd English problems, implying it was probably translated from Chinese by someone who originally spoke Chinese, but it's understandable. I give this 4 stars because, while it seems well made, it is not as well-made as something like a Mitutoyo-still, you get what you pay for, and in this case you're getting a lot for a little!"
4,Accurate and easy to use.,This is a very nice digital caliper. The large display makes it very easy to read. It is very accurate and it provides good flexibility in use. I have never had any issues with mine.
4,The key,"The key of Solomon the king. Is a book who guide you true the Solomon writhing. The art of translation writhing, it`s hard, and the book is heavy to read for people who is not speaking English as a 1th language."
3,Call Me Arrogant,"Perhaps it is hubris when I say that I didn't like this manuscript as much as I thought I would. It wasn't through any fault of the information within, but rather the boring and obtuse writing style. Now, perhaps I am arrogant to challenge S.L. Mathers, and perhaps King Solomon himself, when I say that it was long, slow and, at times, unnecessarily vague. When contemplating purchasing this book, however, you must remember that it wasn't intended as a quiet read. This is a Grimoire, and as such does not belabor the point much with storytelling. If you are looking for expoundation on occult philosophy, then I would not recommend this book. If, however, you are already versed in the Esoteric Occult system and ready to closely examine ritual work on your own, I suggest that you peruse this manual and incorporate its ideas."
2,"Slim volume, slim story","The fact that it is self-published explains the exorbitant cost of this slim volume, but the story, too, comes up grossly short.Once you read the cover flap explaining that the first time author is a retired nonagenarian who has taken up writing in spite of a serious macular degeneration, you will however appreciate his pluck and earnest gift for storytelling."
3,"Love the movie, the keychain, not so durable.","I didn't even have a chance to break it myself, it came with the key ring broken off already. Luckily I am realllllly crafty so i think I am going to make it a magnet or mount it to inside my car."
1,A formula without excitement.,"I did not like this book at all. It is a basic formula... landless knight marries wealthy heiress. Of course, relatively speaking, all romance novels are a formula to a degree. It is the twists on the plot that the author can offer and the creation of characters that are dear to the reader that makes the book different and one worth remembering.I found that I did not care about either Rose or Dominic. They were entirely too one-dimensional. The story did not build suspense and as stated, it is merely a simple formula. There is the obligatory spurned lover who stirs up trouble and the villian from which the hero must save the heroine, but again, it simply did not hold my interest. On the plus side, Ms. Mason does a good job of creating passionate and sexy love scenes, but overall, this was not enough to hold my interest."
4,A Very Good Romance,"This was my first Connie Mason romance. I happened to enjoy it very much. I love the forced marriage-never met scenario. The switch was very enjoyable and the hero was smart enough to figure it quickly. The nasty uncle becoming acceptable in the end was too much for me, but I definately recommend it."
1,Painful to read,"I have read Connie Mason before and found that I enjoyed 50% of her books and didn't care for the other 50%. Alas, The Dragon Lord falls into the latter half. The plot was too simple, any twists and intrigue presented were predictable, the characters were unlikeable, and the dialogue was insipid. Ms. Mason has produced fun reads and I'm sure she will again, but don't bother with this tale."
2,SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT'S NOT SO ROMANTIC,"This is the first book that I tried to read by Connie Mason. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find the desire to finish this story.The premise of the book sounds highly entertaining and highly romantic. But in my opinion, there's just something about the description of the male anatomy being described by the word C--O--C--K does not seem so romantic to me. Everytime the hero starts describing how he would like to ""ram his engorged c--k into her wet center"" well it just conjures up a picture of a rutting bull in my head.I read quite a few romance books a day. There are some that are just soooo good that I can't put them down. Then there some books that I have to eventually force myself to read, this is definitely one of them."
1,crap,"looks nothing like the picture, which could possibly be wood. what arrived was a wood facsimile with wood grain printed upon it"
4,"In the land of the blind, the 1-eyed man is....compassionate","Some thirty years ago, I read, in Spanish, the novella ""San Manuel Bueno, martyr"", included in this collection. This week I read it again.As a young man, to me it seemed that San Manuel had dishonestly misled the devout peasants of his isolated village. At nearly age 60, I now accept my own foibles and those of others, so I can see that San Manuel had found perhaps the only compassionate solution to the dilemma of his own clear vision surrounded by the benighted -- and sacrificed himself to it.As I write this review, in 2004, we are spectators to a world torn by conflict between devout fanatics. Does Unamuno's solution hold in a world where such devout believers burst forth from their villages to inflame the world in the name of their narrow beliefs?"
3,Love it but mildly disappointing.,I love the series sooo much but unfortunately at the end it starts getting a bit disappointing.
1,Beware of accessory rip-off,"The refurbished planer comes with no accessories, the amazon product description is not honored by CPO Bosch. When I complained about the missing chip bag CPO told me to call Bosch Parts which wanted to charge me $39 plus shipping! You get a brand new planer in retail package with full accessories for only a little more than the refurb price. If the price is too good to be true it probably is."
4,basic and simple,"This book is easy to read and understand. You don't have to run to the dictionary every five words. I recommend it to any interested in communications. The concepts work in all situations, not just business. It was a great help."
1,outrageous price,"This is perhaps the most expensive book besides collectables. Judging from the size and amount of information, it probably worths $5 - but I had to buy it simply because the professor uses it as textbook.Granted that this is a book for business management professionals or to-be's, but this does not mean the book should be this expensive. You'll know what I mean when you see the book. I think they they are taking advantage of that fact that most people buy this book get reimbursed - my self for one will get reimbursement from my company, but I resent the fact that I have to buy such an expensive book and waste my company's money only because I have to. This is robbery - it's not printing book, it's more like printing money."
4,Excellent read,"Having read Mr. Weisman's SOAR, Jack in the Box, Rogue Warrior (with Richard Marcinko), and the Rogue Warrior novels (with Richard Marcinko)I was curious about his earlier writings. This book does not disappoint. It is a depiction of an American newswriter who is Jewish and it assigned to write stories in Israel for his news paper. The story offers a depiction of Israel that is unlike what we see in the newspapers or on TV. The central love story is well written. I really enjoyed this and will be sharing it with friends and family. If you're looking for some intrigue, you'll find it here. If you're looking for controversy, you'll find it here. If you're looking for a rich, beautiful story, you'll find it here. This is a great read. I was sorry that the story came to an end."
4,good tutorials!,"I am working out of this book right now and am enjoying it. The projects are fun, and the author manages to explain Houdini clearly without being dry. So far, I have been able to complete the lessons with the Houdini Apprentice Versions (a free downloadable version of the package). However, I don't think this book is for beginners to 3D CGI because a lot of information is tossed at the reader. Sometimes I felt that I was taking a drink from a firehose! A little knowledge of Unix and scripting will help the reader understand expressions. Overall, the book is good value for your money."
4,Lovely sounding flute for the price,"I've been playing shakuhachi pipe flutes for about ten years now, and am now able to produce tones that sound pretty fair. But please be aware that it took months of casual practice before this was so.With this style of flute you are essentially making your mouth be the mouthpiece. The technique is not unlike getting a tone when blowing into a jug or glass soda bottle. Your mouth needs to change shape some for each note as well.I like this flute and take it with me when I'm out and about. By itself, or in drum and hand instrument circles it sounds quite nice. I got applause from the other musicians last time I had a little solo with it. This flute can be surprisingly expressive.It's also priced such that if something happens to it its no big deal."
4,cute and fun,If your child wants a pet but is too young. this is so cute. the little turtle has a magnet when it touches a spot the flower pops up to reveal a frog. we take these to church. little and cute.
4,How do I hookup a vacuum?,It's not too noisey and it's a little bit smoother than the other brands I've tried. It looks to be well made and is fairly ergonomic. But if I can't find a vacuum attachment adaptor for it then I'll have to buy a different brand sander that does have one.
1,Never Again!!!,"This sander touts itself to be ready for the toughest job, but after replacing the pad and having the main center bolt break after slightly over a year of use in a sign shop this sander comes up very short. I was dissapointed in this being a Bosch product and have recently purchased the Rigid 5"" sander which is superior in every way, less vibration, smoother & quicker results, a carrying case, extra pad, sanding discs and other extras."
2,Does the job but,Difficult to clean so requires frequent replacement. I vacuum every couple of weeks and feel the need to change the filter every couple of months. The cost does add up.
2,Often Silly,"An account of the author's often silly efforts to report on the fight in the Tora Bora region. Not much detail about the military or fighting, lots of fluff about his colleagues, especially the women reporters' methods of gaining access to the Afghan warlords. The author is the only person I know who is in love with Geraldo Rivera and, in my opinion gives him much more praise than he deserves."
2,Not for a lot of papers,"I purchased this to stuff all our recent home constructions papers in (plans, permits, invoices, ect). Nothing wanted to fit. This file holder is more of a glorified coupon holder. I would imagine it would be ok for stacks of uniform paper like graded test papers (for a student) or some very light home organization. Not for business or any real volume. I ended up getting a plastic box from staples for the same price."
5,Good organizer,"This is a good organizer for my needs. I wanted something to organize my bills, and this product does the trick. It is sturdier than than other harmonica organizers."
4,Does the job,"A bit more flimsy in person than it looks online, but it does the job I need it to do. I'm in college and I don't like to throw out any papers, in case I need them later, and it's great for that purpose."
3,Needs a little more work........,"This expanding folder is really great and I think, in the future it will soften a little at the bending and expanding points. This folder always wants to close and not expand. All bending points and expansion points are plastic. I am in hopes that it will ease up over time and not crack.If you need a more friendly expanding file folder, I would recomment one with cloth expansion areas. I store charcoal drawings in this one so it is well suited on keeping the drawings protected and flat. The hard part is getting the drawings in and out without wrinkling the drawings.."
4,"SHOOT ME WITH YOUR ""RAYGUN""","This CD may appear to appeal only to the most die-hard MGB fans - there are only five songs and one of them, ""Haven't Slept in Years"" is a re-recording of a song from ""Last of the Ghetto Astronauts"", while another one ""Alabama Motel Room"" is lifted directly from the ""...Astronauts"" album.And yet, this short CD has two of the best songs MGB has put out: ""Raygun"" and ""Generation X-Wing"".It's short, but it's sweet and next to ""Beautiful Midnight"", this is MGB at it's best."
1,Appeared out of business for a while - at least re-organizing.,"The company web site was down for a while, is now back up, advertising the FrogPad 2 for pre-purchase with release of the product in 2013. Previously they had advertised for pre-purchase with production in early 2012. It's not at all clear that this is still a viable company."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed. The book read more like a fiction novel and some of the content was hard to find plausible.
2,Not for the S-Plus beginner!,"The book does a good job of explaining all of the techniques and applications of S-Plus, but doesn't give adequate examples. You're left trying to figure out what commands to type in. This book may be better as a reference guide for a more experienced user."
2,Durability,My 4 year old son recieved this tent as a Christmas gift. believe it was one of his favorite gifts. We set it up that day and he slept in it that night and the following week to 10 days. then the shafts on the poles were splintering and we could not fix it or prevent it from collapsing.its a shame it could not have been built better.
3,Victoria'sexperinceher father's death she became independant,"This books shares a wonderful thought for everybody, especially thoose who lost someone they have lost.Hopefully one day those will not have a tragdic lost in there lives like victoria and her mother have been through. When they went through this, they learned more than they expected, for instance they became closer in there relationship, and also, they learned to deal with there problems in mature ways."
1,not very good,"I have bought other re-manufactured products in the past but have never had a problem until I received this vacuum, rather than a refurbished unit this one looked like someone returned it, even had a dirty filter. Upon assembly the on/off switch wouldn't work, so it had to be unplugged to turn it off.In my case suction was very poor whether I used the accessories or not. Noise didn't bother me, it's as loud as any other vacuum out there, and I couldn't find any issues with the container other than it didn't lock very well and it felt rather ""loose"" as if the locking mechanism was badly worn out.Really disappointed as the only reason I bought was to replace my 4 years old $48 vacuum, but they perform very similarly with the hoover having to do as many passes as my old vacuum to cleanup any dirt.The picture does not match the unit I received, however the model number did. So the picture in this listing is not accurate."
5,Excellent Customer Service and Great Vacuum,"I found this vacuum model through Consumer Reports as one of the higher rated models. The first vacuum I ordered was defective (stopped working within the first few minutes of use). I sent an email explaining why I was returning it and chose to have it replaced. The communication was easy and even set up a pickup of my return by UPS the next day (free of charge)! The same day UPS picked the old one up from my house, the replacement was shipped. I got it in less then a week and am 100% satisfied.The suction is great, even when using the attachments. This was especially important since I have carpeted stairs. The vacuum was well packaged and looks great! I didn't think it was particularly loud; sounded the same as any other vacuum I've had. Also, I didn't have any problem carrying it up and down my stairs, so the weight wasn't a problem either. I would highly recommend this product, especially for the price!"
5,it really does a good job,"my last vacuum made it five years, and i was going to get a dyson, but then i came to my senses about spending that much for a machine. it does an excellent job picking up the cat hair, dust and dirt - although i do reccommend that you empty and clean the cannister often for maximum performance. it works well- the only thing is that it does not come with the small power attachment that is in all the photos - it wasn't a deal buster for me, but i was a little disappointed. overall for the price you can't go wrong"
1,Lasted two weeks,Received vacuum promptly and all worked fine for two weeks with very little use. Now today the motor started making noise and a strong electrical burning odor coming from machine. I will return for service or replacement to manufacturer and see what happens. If this machine was re manufactured as claimed I hope the others where gone through more stringently. Follow up contacted hoover and they covered repairs at an authorized dealer. All is fine now. hope it stays that way.
4,"So far, I love it!","I purchased this reconditioned in order to save myself a couple of bucks (or a hundred) and so far have used it 3 times. I bought this because my landlord had a much older vintage similar model, and I loved it. I am glad I bought this one; it is extremely effective and the sucking power is incredible, both with it in the vacuuming position and also positioned straight up in order to use the tools. It practically sucks dust bunnies across the room into the crevice tool! Only complaints are it is rather heavy and not easy to store away in my small home, but that was not unexpected.I would buy it again; I have not emptied the dirt container yet so I haven't run into any problems with that aspect of it, but I know what to expect from prior experience. I feel this was a great deal [...]."
3,Hoover U57009RM,"This vacuum cleaner is rather loud and the engine sounds terrible, when turned off. It cleans well and its pickup of dirt is great. The tool for the stairs is underpowered and does not allow for proper cleanup."
5,Casey Luv's Scary Stories,"The Scary Storie Reader was great. Almost all of my classmates checked it out of the library. I was lucky because the library only has 1 copy and I managed to get a hold on it. After I started to read a few stories, I could see why everyone wanted it. It had terrifying stories! I gave this book 5 stars because it really deserves it for its thrilling horror stories and its well written chapters. I recommend you buy this book or at least check it out of the library if you haven't already. It was truly a good book."
1,where?,i cant give a review cuz i didnt get the dvd yet it been almost three weeks now. what happened?
4,Assignments were very helpful,I have read several digital photo instruction books. What set this one apart (in addition to being very readable) was the assignments given in each chapter. With photography you learn by doing and it was helpful to have something specific to do to make sure that you understood the lesson. I recommend this book for anyone with a digital camera (especially an SLR) who is tired of being controlled by the camera (shooting only in automatic mode). Read this book and start using all those extra settings that make photography fun and creative!
1,Be Warned: Not Waterproof,"It seems like there are two products being reviewed here. I specifically got these gloves because they were said to be waterproof. Many of the front page reviews for this item praise its waterproof-ness. However, the gloves I got are in no way waterproof. They have some rubber studs on the palm, but the rest is woven cotton! They got very wet instantly when I wore them and didn't dry out for days.I can only think that the reviews that say they got a waterproof glove got a very different glove, so: be warned!"
4,Excellent and Chilling,"There's a certain cool sensuality at the center of Aickman's chilling stories. His ""turns"" are suspenseful, surprising at times, and genuinely scary. A master of the slow reveal, Aickman leads his readers with a kind of command and the reader eagerly follows. He has sadly been lost to all but a small, but very devoted, cult following."
4,Vintage CLAMP,"The art's great, but the story's a little shallow, as, uh, CLAMP's stuff sometimes can be. I'm only familiar with this first volume, but it looks like CLAMP fans will get much more of a kick out of this than the average reader (the story crosses over a quivering horde of CLAMP characters from previous manga into a single, new universe). A big plus for me was that key characters from Cardcaptor Sakura are significant elements in *this* story, and I had always thought CCS could've been wrapped up in a better way; I have a vested interest in how CLAMP'll deal with Tsubasa.Pick it up if you liked Li Syaoran from Cardcaptor Sakura (Sakura's there, too, but she's in a magical coma or something; I have a feeling she'll stay that way for a while), are already a CLAMP fan, or if you think the cover is really swell (same awesome art on the inside)."
5,Navy Clogs,"They're Clarks, the best clogs made. I ordered them because they are a wide width. I usually wear an 8 1/2, but because of the extra width, the size 8 is fine. I love these as I love all my Clarks shoes."
4,Times not to forget,"Where ""Casablanca"" leaves off, two books pick up the story of leftist and liberal European intellectuals escaping from Hitler to what were then safer parts of the world. Varian Fry's *Surrender on Demand* describes smuggling intellectual and political dignitaries from Vichy-controlled Marseilles to the freer port of Lisbon, and Salka Viertel's *The Kindness Of Strangers* tells about welcoming distinguished emigres and helping them to make a home in the orbit of Hollywood. A charming book, full of celebrity gossip along with more serious themes about loyalty and tests of courage. Viertel also tells the sad story of distinguished emigres greeted with indifference by U.S. public authorities, and left-leaning heroes of the '30s intellectual fight against Hitler becoming political suspects again in the U.S. as ""premature anti-fascists."" Food for thought in many ways."
3,Nice for $10-$15,"This knife was advertised as being $70+ originally.... at that rate, it's highway robbery.Sheath is fine, knife is fine, but not for more than $15. Holds a decent edge when sharpened and is reasonably light."
1,do not buy this,This device did not kill any moles for me. It was a waste of time and money. It never tripped or killed a mole/vole. Maybe I didnt set it properly though i tested it a lot and it seemed like it would work
3,Mole trap,"Mole traps arrived and one box was open. This trap had a bad rivet in the latching lever (latch flopped around so it would not latch). I repaired rivet and works fine now. The other unopened box had the safety chain missing, I had some chain close to what was on the other so I made one. Poor quality control? Other wise I hope they will work and last a long time. Kind of cheaply made compaired to the mole traps my father had. I know that maybe I could have sent them back but I can't wait any longer to rid my yard of these moles. They are out and set hope they work as advertized Quality is lacking but price wise I'll find out later if they were worth the money I spent."
4,Candy Factory Fun,"This was my first reading of a Grant Michaels mystery, but I'm ready for more! His hero, hair dresser Stan Kraychick, is known as Vannos when he works at Snips, but when he's out catching murderers, he's just plain good! Great characters, enough tension to keep me reading, and guessing who killed who!"
2,Did the author ever venture into the 'out-back of Austria'?,"I've been to Austria COUNTLESS times and have been to all corners and nearly every valley in Austria...I bought this book with the hope that it might help to discover something new....and of course to check on the information on places I have been and been impressed by..... this book is seriously lacking in place to stay and eat in the countryside. It misses out on some of the very lovely and amazing Austrian accommodations and places to eat..either food , ambiance OR location(view).... Bummer...please get a new author lonely planet you really alwyas do a good job."
1,Poor Quality,"This book has serious manufacturing defects. First books pages were not in align, same problem with replacement book. Amazon must have no quality control, because I do not known how they could miss this. Amazon was great in replacing book, but sent me another defective book. Had no other problems with Amazon books in past. If you order this book expect defects."
4,Bought this a while ago,"I bought this awhile ago and I am still using it. It works fine, but doesn't stay charged for as long as I would like. It also takes a long time to charge."
3,Makes its point,"Imagine a day when all of the Mexicans in the state of California suddenly disappear. Garden tools go unused and fruit lies rotting in the fields as a world full of Anglos, African-Americans, and Orientals tries to cope without their Hispanic husbands, fathers, workers, and entertainers. The action in this film is a bit scattered and confusing, but eventually the point is made. This country depends on Hispanic workers, be they legal or illegal. Occasionally statistics are shown which indicate the large percentage of Hispanics who _______ (fill in the blank.) Despite the uneven pace, the frenetic scene changes and the less-than-stellar acting, this movie does make its point."
2,I didn't like the movie,"Didn't even watch, but about 1/4 of the movie, before we stopped it and forgot about it! It was a bad purchase."
4,tastes good!,"This tastes good! Needs a little more chocolate flavoring but I just added hersheys syrup. Shh!! the texture is light which is great because I hate protein shakes that are super thick that you have to choke down. If you are looking for an inexpensive protein shake that tastes good, this is a great way to go. You might need to do a couple of them a day though (low protein content)"
4,"Tastes pretty much like chocolate milk, a little sweeter than I'd prefer","Of the protein powders I've tried, this is my favorite (I've gone through most options they carry at trader joes, includign the Aria Vanilla which I didn't love, as well as the Sun Warrior Vanilla that is sold here on amazon). In the end, this Aria Chocolate is my preferred powder. I have no idea why its marketed as a womens protein - my boyfriend drinks it as well when I buy it.I usually use a mason jar to mix my protein shakes, and find that mixing them at night before I go to bed gives them a good amount of time to really disolve. I just shake it up and stick it in the fridge, then, when I wake up in the AM and drink before the gym there isn't any undissolved powdery chunks in my shake.I'm a repeat buyer of the Aria chocolate so in the end I would recommend it to others."
1,Deceptive Advertisement,"THIS BOOK IS NOT WRITTEN BY JAMES ALLEN. This individual took James Allen's book and rewrote it so it would be easier to read (in modern day language). If I wanted to purchase James Allen's books that is what I expected to received, not a wolf is sheeps clothing. I would think twice about ordering this book!"
5,fantastic story-telling,"I enjoyed this book of four short stories. It was well-written and very subtle. Barker tells four very different stories about the human mind. The first story was the most interesting, focusing on two inmates in a prison. It focuses on the question of original sin."
5,Enthralling book- couldn't go to sleep without finishing it.,"I read this book for college and couldn't go to sleep without finishing it. Written simply but very powerfully, Rachel Calof's story hits you like a load of bricks. She wedges her way into your heart instantly and doesn't leave! You'll be drawn into this amazing story of hardship and perseverance and want to learn more about prairie life. I highly recommend this book. It's a quick and easy read and will broaden your persectives and make you appreciate the life you have now!"
3,A Great Tale Spoiled in the Retelling,"I purchased this book after seeing a television documentary on Monsieur de Saint-George, and was fascinated by his life and achievements (and eager to hear more of his music).Unfortunately, though the his life is fascinating and takes many turns, the quality of the storytelling here is not up to the task. As anyone who has read academic research will know, a remarkable topic can quickly be drowned out by droning prose.Having said that, I felt at every point eager to hear the next twist or turn of this man's life. Perhaps someone will do him better service.PS - Suggest if you decide to proceed with this book, that you purchase the music to listen to as you read. Perhaps it will improve the whole experience, and will definitely give you better insight into his achievements."
1,Might be scary for younger children,"Here on Amazon it says the age range for this book is 4-8 but I would strongly reconsider giving this book to a four year old. They read this book in my daughter's preschool, and she cried for an hour at home because she was so scared. She is almost five. The illustrations are very graphic, and looked a little creepy. I'm sure the overall message is good, and apparently other kids love it, but we won't be buying this one in our house!"
5,GREAT book for normal people,"Seriously,My daughter's 6 and read the entire book to me by HERSELF!That anyone thinks it's creepy or abnormal is, well, abnormal.If anyone is freaked out about it, it's me, with all these absolutely nutty comments.This book and its message are terrific!!!!And the book's illustrations are absolutely beautiful. Even my crazy right wing conservative parents who are both over the age of 80 think this book and its pictures and message are wonderful.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and highly recommend."
1,Traumatized My Daughter For Weeks Now,"My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to my daughter and her class. It scared my daughter so bad that she cannot sleep at night and has been crying throughout the day for two weeks now. She is totally traumatized. I can't believe that Scholastic would recommend this book for 4 to 8 year olds. The premise of the story is too sophisticated for kids of this age and I am appalled that you recommend it for such ages. I can tell you that we were getting ready to order a bunch of scholastic books through school for our daughter, but after this experience, I will never them you a penny. Thanks for scaring the crap of out of my 5-year old daughter and making my and my wife's life a living hell in the process."
1,Terrified my 5 1/2 year old.,This book is creepy. It scared my daughter and even made me feel uncomfortable as I was reading it. We picked it up at the library. I really wish we'd read the reviews here before we read it.
3,A Bad Case of Stripes,I think it is a good book because it is funny but strange. The book also tells you about every day pressures of schoolmates.
2,Pice of junck,Never going to buy this thing. used it to go ding ones and when i when to clean my gear the next day it was all rusted up. Cut the rope of an old ancor that i whanted to recover from the bottom and had to recharpen the knefe. Advice all to spend more money and get a good knife from Rusia or US where the metal is of good quialety.
1,"Well, it will probably impress people when they see it on my bookshelf...","Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too wordy!!! I adore yoga, have practiced for several years and currently am becoming a teacher. I have endless books on yoga, energy healing and other ""new age"" titles and all of them engage me more than this book. If the book could talk, it would sound like the teacher from Charlie Brown!!! haha It does seem to me that if your brain can grasp the style that the author writes in, you might love this book as it's packed with a gigantic amount of information. For me, however I know that when a writer's style doesn't speak to my soul, I can read a whole page and not know what the heck I just read. Maybe for some people...not for me. Next, please!!! :P"
3,Didn't come with the caboose as pictured,"I was a little disappointed that I paid almost $13 for this used toy when it didn't even come with the little caboose as pictured. I knew it was used, so it definitely beat paying $50 like most collector's want for a new one still in its box. I'm fine with some of the paint chips and dings, but my son is only 2 and loves getting to connect all his Thomas and Friends trains by the magnets on the caboose. The item did ship fast, so that was nice."
3,Not as good as expected,"Elmer's Slide-All is a dry spray lubricant that claims not to leave an oily residue. That is true, but it does leave a visible whitish film behind (it can be wiped off with a cloth). It is also not nearly as slippery as silicone. It is supposed to be safe for plastics, but since it contains acetone I'm not sure that I would trust it 100%. Also, the can does not include any kind of extension tip or tube for use in tight spaces."
5,Great Stuff!,"This product works very well for a number of different applications. I have used it instead of WD-40 on squeaky car and house doors--no oily stains. It is also useful for freeing sticky sliding windows. It ""loosens up"" and lubricates weathered padlocks and I know jewelers who use it for helping to unkink small necklace chains. No odors, no stains...as I said, it's great stuff."
4,Lots of Information,"I have these five books, and the wealth of information they give is well worth the price."
1,A very poor novel,"The first couple of pages of 'The Power' are intriguing and promise to develop into a gripping thriller. However, after that it is downhill all the way. This is possibly one of the worst books that I have ever read. The characters are paper thin, and completely unbelievable. The dialogue is mundane and pedestrian. The development of the plot is juvenile, it reminds me of the universal baddies such as Smersh from the Man from U.N.C.L.E. The 'stage whisper' comments from the characters explaining the significance of particular plot developments are insulting to the readers intelligence.For a far more credible, readable and enjoyable thriller read Stephen Leather."
5,True American Hero,"The story told here is one of adventure, heroism and inspiration. One does not need to be a Vet to enjoy every page of this story. Phil has a real talent and I am looking forward to his next book. I haven't enjoyed a non-fiction in quite some time; this book touches on feelings everyone can relate to. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Vietnam war and the true story of what our men had to endure both on the battlefield and the battle they had to fight once back home with the Veterans Administration. This book will open your eyes to a lot of events most of us never knew anything about."
2,Beware chess players,"I'm a chess player first, and am interested in computer hardware and software second. I followed both matches while they were being played, including the sad (yet typical) paranoid delusions Garry sufferred in the second game of the second match that the IBM team had cheated. My hopes were thus high for a book from the leader of the IBM team, discussing the dramatic confrontation with one of chess's most notorious World Champions. Alas, the author ramblingly recounts insignificant details, sees the computer as some extension of his own ego and over and over claims credit for personally ""beating"" Garry, and provides way too much technical computer information for the average layman looking for a good read. I'm pretty sure if you ran into this guy at a party that within three minutes you'd make the decision to avoid him for the rest of the night, his writing is boring and full of that odd hubris that frequently afflict the computer people. A disappointment."
2,Blunder of Kluwer Publishers,"This book contains useful formulas and derivations which may not be in other books, but the English is awful. It also has some significant technical mistakes in some equations. I can't believe Kluwer published this. Quoting from page 7, ""In real application, it very frequently happens . Very that noise randomly replaces signal values that in this case are completely lost. In such situation, in general, the model of impulse noise is used."" If I were Kluwer, I'd do a product recall, edit the book and release it under a different title."
2,Not as advertised!!,According to the description above-this DVD is supposed to have 4 Scooby-Doo episodes as well as a Powerpuff Girls bonus. The DVD I received only had 2 Scooby-Doo episodes and that is all-very disappointing!!!!!
2,"yes, it chops, but not good with cleanup.","I was initially excited to use this product for chopping, but was disappointed with it in the end. (Luckily it was just a gift.) It does chop up items, but not without equal or greater effort that you might use to cut things on a cutting board. I tried to use walnuts, and they become lodged up in the blades. I honestly can't wedge them out now, so it's not easy to clean. A better option for efficient chopping: get a ulu (cutting board and knife/blade)and you can cut things quickly because you don't have to hold them and cleanup is easy."
1,Nice idea but very poor design,"It is true that the Zyliss is one of the easiest to clean choppers on the market but the device is very easy to break. There is a small flimsy piece of plastic that prevents chopped food from moving past the blades into the back of the unit. After 3 uses this piece broke and is now completely useless. I cannot find a replacement. I bought this unit because all AMAZON reviews were positive, but this is one time that the reviews were wrong. Please save yourself some money and buy something else."
5,An excellent Coil,"This product came very quick to my hands, is a high quality coil! is the best value, price value! ideal for street cars"
2,Basically the same stuff that I saw on the show.,"I was very dissapointed in this book. I thought I was going to get all kinds of dirt that they never showed on the T.V. show but with the exception of a few small facts, if you watched the show religously, you will already know most of the contents in this book. Don't waste your money unless you missed a lot from the actual show"
4,Enjoyed the music.,"I bought this CD for my granddaughter prior to taking her to see ""Billy Elliott the Musical"" at the Fisher Theater in Detroit. We enjoyed it very much."
4,Repeating the live theater experience,"While I've never heard any of Elton John's songs from this performance being whistled by people on the street, the music is engaging enough to want to hear it a few more times after leaving the theater. Better yet, my advice is to listen to this recording BEFORE enjoying the live performance. Given the British accent and some questionable acoustics, one can miss important chunks of lyrics in a theater setting. If you close your eyes while listening to this recording, you can even visualize the dancing."
4,WORTH IT,"We received our pot rack yesterday. I was very surprised at how fast it came, but even more surprised that it had to be put together. That was not a huge problem though because it doesn't take long at all to put it together. It is very heavy duty and shiny. We haven't installed it yet but it was well worth the money spent so far."
3,They messed up with male/female nouns,"It seems that they tried hard to cover all the ways that a word can take in Spanish, but they failed. They should have keep it simple with fewer words and less time configurations. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend so she could learn some Spanish, but it was very hard even for me to form any coherent sentence (I'm native Spanish speaker).After a week or so, we didn't use it any longer."
1,find an alternative if you can,"I bought this as a required text for my masters class. It was the most confusing, poorly-written book I have every read! If you can find an alternative, do it! It took a whole class of masters candidates, as well as the professor, to disect it and try to make some sense of it!"
2,Required text; not an easy read,"This text layout is confusing. The scenarios are beneficial. However, the text itself is difficult to follow. This text lacks consistent organization. Unfortunately, it is a required text for my master's program. Otherwise, I would have chosen another text to read regarding this subject."
2,Disappointed,"This product didn't meet my expectations. When I opened it and started to put it together, I noticed that the finish was chipped in a few places. Also there were some scuff marks on the rack that I could not wipe off. I sent mine back and am looking for another."
5,Awesome Rack and Value Priced,I had three different racks in the past and they all fell short of my needs. This rack is great all of my pots and pans from all three sets fit and it handles the weight of cast iron as part of that. Also the shelf on the top is great for the accessories for the kits.
3,Great Tent But Not Durable,"I've had this tent for a few months and now need to order another because like the person who reviewed the same tent in Batman style, one of the tent poles broke and jutted out dangerously through the thin fabric. We have no idea how it broke as nobody put much pressure on it, but because the tent is so fantastic we're going to buy another one. So beware -- great tent but don't get too attached to it because it won't last."
5,At last,"Though this movie deserves better treatment and more fanfare, the important thing is that it's coming out; it was never even released on cassette, to my knowledge. I got my bootlegged copy on ebay. Everyone talks about Three Women being Robert Altman's forgotten's masterpiece, but this tops my list. The greatest movie about gambling ever made, and certainly one of the great buddy films of all time. Thanks to Roger Ebert's new site, you can read his 1974 review of the fim, where he said it was superior to MASH. Hopefully this release will bring it all the attention it deserves."
4,Classic funny movie,A funny movie that is a must see for any gambler. It has many great one liners and sight gags that help it move along.
2,"Quality seems good, but didn't ""work""",Purchased this (as well as blue cohosh) at the recommendation of a doula and several other holistically inclined momma types in order to give mother nature a nudge. Unfortunately it did not work and after several weeks I resorted to surgery anyway.
1,not as informative as youd think,"first of all the sling depends on power. second of all technique. this book is a lie if i ever seen one and right now it sits in the trash. the point of it is that first of all its white, not black. second, it gives you a little understanding but lies and says the sling is like a High powered rifle, or it gives you that idea anyway, not actually says it. like it could kill cape buffalo in one throw. this book aint worth your precious time, not even worth reading. 12 photos for six techniques, 2 of which should not be prescribed for Beginners. serious injury is a risk, i threw my back out and wore out my arm and learned to aim the sling on my own without the book. Dilligence proceeds over Intelligence. when it comes to slinging any way. but go ahead and buy the book but your wasting money you dont need to lose."
2,By the numbers,2 stars for intriguing premise and the first few chapters show promise. But the deeper it goes the duller it gets.
2,Deep Disappointment,"Sorry, Mr. Child, you imploded with this effort, almost as badly as the ""facility."" Too much pressure from your publisher to meet a deadline, perhaps? The plot has a few interesting aspects, such as the notion that aliens visited earth long ago and left something sinister behind (remember the John W. Campbell short novel ""Who Goes There?""), but overall this book just falls flat. There is way too much psuedo-scientific astrophysics jargon for my taste (and I have an aeronautical/astronautical engineering degree). Character development is weak at best, and the science versus rigid-military-mind conflict is a very tired cliche. Readers of Utopia know that Child can write much better than this."
2,"God book, too bad for some hard profanity","I could have given this book a better rating but I have trouble with authors that think they need to include profanity in their books. A wise person once said, ""profanity is the effort of a feeble brain to express itself forcibly"". I enjoyed the story and the writing. I just really did not like the use of some hard profanity."
2,"Interesting premise, everything else is formulaic","I've been a fan of the Preston/Child books ever since Relic was new, and I've enjoyed some of their solo novels as well. The central mystery here and its explanation are very interesting, but the characters are two-dimensional and so chichéd that at times I wondered if I was reading a novelization of The Abyss. Even in his own previous works, Child has long since overplayed the tired old taciturn-security-type-becomes-paranoid-and-threatening character. Here, it's like he took the security guy from Mount Dragon or the treasure hunter from Riptide or the obsessed meteorite-extraction guy from The Ice Limit and put him in uniform and stuck him underwater. The story arc was predictable, and the whole thing had a very paint-by-numbers kind of feel to it. Child could have done -- and has done -- better."
4,A different Lincold Child Novel,"Lincoln Child's 2 previous books -death match and Utopia- were well written and suspensful. The thing, though, that made them so great was their unique plot lines, a perfect theme park, a dating service which never fails. This new novel deep storm takes a new route. The plot is more Robert Ludlum then Douglas Preston but the elements are still all their, suspence, action, thirlls!! The book may have a slow start but it's a great read."
3,Still a good read,Gave it a 3 only because as I read this book it kept reminding me of Sphere and the Abyss. Although this is still a good read.
3,"Great Story, AWFUL reading","The story is great, and if you're considering the book rather than the audio CD, get the book. A typical Lincoln Child thriller. The audio reading, however, is terrible, with the reader attempting to do a (godawful) Scottish accent, and switching back and forth between various character voices very poorly."
2,Ehh...,"In the summer of 2007, I stayed up for over 24 hours and read Frank Schatzing'sThe Swarm: A Novelin one sitting. After finishing it, I was left at a total loss and a desire to read a similar book. This book was one of the few that I discovered in hopes to enjoy this as much. And yes, it does share some similarities, but those similarities simply fall short of making this book be as enjoyable, gripping or fun as Schatzing's. Maybe because it was a lot more masculine...the cast is very dominated by males here, and the females aren't really very convincing... I think I mostly didn't like it because the plot turned away from the very exciting Atlantis set-up. Also, there were some holes in the plot that were rather troublesome. I'm going to give this one to my dad to read because I think he'll enjoy it, or at least more than I did.UPDATE: And my prediction was accurate - my dad ended up liking it WAY more than I did!"
5,An Oldie but a Goodie,"J. Wallace Hamilton has put together sermons on The Prodigal Son. I owned a copy of this book long ago, but it got itself lost (I don't lose things; they lose themselves) somewhere along the way. I bought this copy and found the sermons just as interesting and entertaining as they were thirty years ago."
5,THE GREATES,Jack London was one of the greatest American writers. I love everything he wrote and I wish I could write as well as he did.
2,Shoddy footwear,I love these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned but the ones I received are poorly put together. On both feet big holes began where the stitching met the sole on the pinky toe. I returned the shoes and got a new pair of the exact same sneaker and the problem happened again. Great looking shoe and a great fit but poorly put together.
2,Great Shoes with a couple of personal flaws,"These are great shoes. I just have a few warnings. The lining around the ankle of my shoes ripped after about a week of wearing them. The shoes are very comfortable, if you like a loose to medium-snug fit, but it is difficult to keep these shoes feeling medium-to-tight on your feet with this elastic pull system. The MAJOR concern/warning I have about these shoes is that they are very slippery when it is wet outside!! I expected an outdoor/hiking shoe like these to have a good grip...and they do on dry surfaces...but they are very slippery when it is wet outside. Especially on wet concrete stairs or wet metal grates, that one may happen to come across while hiking/walking. ---Merrell Chameleon Wrap Stretch GTX XCR---"
1,cheap cheap,"I have owned lamps from this company for years .Oh what a difference a decade makes. My old lamps are still beautiful. The new one was awful. Literally and figuratively, it couldn't hold a candle next to this imposter. Spend a little more and get something else-almost anything else."
3,A good basic shampoo,"I use this product as well as the matching shampoo. I have mixed feelings about them. They are better than the grocery store hair care products, but in the winter time they dry out my hair too much; I have to use another Aveda product set every few days and/or add in a hot oil treatment. In the summer they are fine. Also, Amazon has them over priced by $4.50"
4,Great book!,"Marina Fitch really did a good job writing this book! I enjoyed not only the science fiction aspects, but also the personal aspects. It left you struck, and forced you to think of the Earth as more than just land to build on. Although I don't believe in ""the anger of the Earth"" it began to seem almost realistic. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction/fantasy, and even those who don't. In fact, I'm not even a Sci-fi fan!"
1,Awful all the way around!,"This movie was poorly made with bad actors. Examples include the disconnected school scenes and the forced or unrealistic conversations of the actors. The most disturbing aspect of this movie was the contorted Gospel they presented. There was no Christian elements to this, actually. No love towards each other, no repentance, no following Jesus. The one guy has had a child with one of the teens, but at the end of the movie he's with a different girl. It's not even like there was any reconciliation between any of them. I was very disappointed to say the least. Christ calls us to follow Him, not gratify our flesh.Soli Deo Gloria!"
1,Breaks very easily,"I've had mine a few months. Bought it brand new. My house is not overly difficult to clean and I have no pets.I have had nothing but problems with this unit and I'm about to buy a Dyson or some other premium machine.This thing loses suction after vacuuming half the floor. A really bad design.The final straw is that they power switch no longer works. I am an intelligent person with an engineering degree, and for the life of me I cannot figure out how to take this thing apart to diagnose the problem.Do not buy one of these."
2,"Too many mistakes, badly written",I don't think this should be sold as a CNC schoolbook because it has too little information and the software doesn't work good.
4,Story Telling Is A Art,Story Telling is really an Art Form for African American Family Historian it is this person that tells the stories and history of the family this book fits into any family gathering story telling celebration
5,Wonderful set of bowls!,"I'd been wanting a good set of copper mixing bowls, and these definitely fit the bill! Egg whites beat perfectly fluffy. And, each has a brass loop so they can hang on a wall for decoration, or off a pot rack. You can't beat these bowls for the money!"
5,Unique,"This is an interesting film, given that it attempts to view the Arab-Israeli conflict through a lens sympathetic to dispossessed Palestinians. It is also unique in that it is one of but a handful of films that does not use the worn-out habit of portraying Arabs as nothing more than a horde of violent terrorists or oil-rich buffoons.The film is well worth watching, especially for those who are only familiar with one side of the conflict. The fact that it was filmed on location in Israel and the Territories makes it that much more remarkable, as this is a side of life that the Israeli government is not anxious for the rest of the world to see."
1,Just small talk,"Perhaps this book should not be considered a serious book at all, as it is full of anectodal small talk instead of sound analysis. No theory, no sound model, no serious cases. An insult to even a mediocre intelligence. Just avoid it."
5,Outstanding!,"This book is terrific, a must read for any organization looking for a solid, no nonsense way to diffentiate themselves from the competition without focusing on product or price. Sure, there are alot of customer service books out there, but this one hits it on the head! It's PEOPLE and the experience they create for the customer that are your brand.The book in clear fashion outlines the easy to grasp ways a company can truly diffentiate themselves from the competition without placing the major focus on product or price.The author writes in plain, fun, and easy to understand english with many real life examples to illustrate the message. While the book is a quick read, it is packed with very good material. One of the most important business books I have ever read. The book itself is in a Category of One! (Sorry, pun intended)."
3,Resurrection,"This book is so much better than the previous one it resurrects the just born series. In this piece we have a new cast of characters, more seasoned adventurers than in The Savage Caves and the story is of a 1000 year epic struggle involving higher powers rathern than the cave crawl of the previous book.The pace is slower and the characters are allowed to give much more exposition, probably too much exposition with many speeches giving the history of everyone. However it does allow the characters to become much more fleshed out than the ones from The Savage Caves.The actual adventure consists of a bard, mage, cleric and ranger trying to finally end the terror of a very powerful undead. It was actually solidly mediocre and uninspired, just what you'd expect from franchise fiction.All in all, an improvement over the very poor The Savage Caves yet only a mediocre 3 out of 5."
3,Do not buy these speakers,"I am using these speakers with an IPOD. The satellite speakers and the subwoofer all give out a white noise hiss, even with the volume turned all the way down and even with the IPOD disconnected from the speakers. By placing the subwoofer under my bed, the hiss is not noticable because it is absorbed before it can be dispersed. With the volume turned up, the hiss is not noticeable. Although they do not produce enough power to shake the room, I find them adequate for use in my bedroom.I am surprised and a bit disappointed that Altec Lansing would sell a product having such a problem. However, because I ended up paying only $20 for the speakers after two rebates, I have decided to temporarily keep them for now. Just remember that they are definitely not worth the $50 most retailers are asking for them.Since I enjoy soft music, where the hiss is more evident, I will probably give them away this spring and replace them with a system having no background noise."
5,Jason Cfrandell Yoga,"Bought this CD a few years ago when I first started Yoga. I still use it. If I can't get to my yoga practice I pull out one of Jason's CD's and just love life on my mat in the comfort of my own home. Jason's voice is very direct and soothing. He often reminds you to be aware of your posture. He brings you through many hip openers, standing poses and sun salutations. When I first read 20 minutes my thought was what is that going to do for me. I'm happy to say that I feel rejuvenated after following a sequence. So if you are new to yoga or an intermediate yogi who enjoys following a command to your next position I highly recommend this CD. The models are beautiful"
5,Excellent workout?,I have found some Yoga DVDs too vigorous for me and some too unchallenging. This DVD is perfect for me. I have been practicing Yoga for over 8 years and am 69 years if age. However I think it is suitable for younger ages too.
4,GPS,I haven't had this out on the water yet but installation was easy and my Matrix 17 recognized it and locked on to the satalites quickly. The reason for 4 stars is I haven't had it on the water yet to see how accurately it will lead you to a spot.
3,A good introduction for new listeners,"However, old fans will be disappointed by the continuing lack of new material. Note that the liner notes contain many typographical errors. XTC are indeed geniuses, but this double CD set may leave listeners thinking ""Prove it."""
2,Just too small,"I blame myself for not paying closer attention to the product specifications, but 5""x7"" is just too small to make a useful mousepad. I encourage all customers to take note of the dimensions and stick with larger items. To use a mouse effectively, you need a bigger area."
2,Long Term Review... not so good... weakness is the charging system,"I have owned this really neat player for 2 years. I am very happy with the sound, the controls and the the directory structure. Battery life is acceptable. Even with all that, I need to buy something else.The reason? The ""subpack"" that plugs into the bottom of the player, which allows the device to charge, is so poorly designed that I have resorted to a team of rubber bands to keep the charger attached. That worked for a couple of months until the weird ""subpack"" cracked in half. No more ability to charge the device until I find a new adapter. Here is a link to the currently non-in-stock replacement part on Amazon. [...]Bottom line? Don't buy this player."
4,One of my favourite gadgets,"Positive Points:- Excellent sound- Lots of features- Good interface- File managment is just like in windows- Radio reception is very good- Works great as a tape recorderI would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the following negative points:- PC sometimes doesn't recognize the device- Connectivity to PC and other devices is somewhat of pain beacuse of the adapter (have to carry it around everywhere)- Screen resolution isn't good enough for playing movies, but heck, I was never interested in it's mpeg4 feature.Bottom line - I'm Happy."
3,Ok,This is an alright program. Most of the beats sound basically the same just with different sounds. Out of all the beats I only found music I wanted for two songs. If you need beats and you can't make your own this is probably the best program you can get.
1,A cheap piece of junk!,"This lamp is an example of Chinese manufacturing at its worse. The shade will not stay in position; the cord is much too short to be useful, the magnetic base lets go with any machine vibration or contact with the lamp and finally the gooseneck is poorly attached to the base and will not stay in position.I have a lot of Grizzly tools and generally they are pretty good. This is a cheap piece of crap and Grizzly should be ashamed to list it in their catalog. You would be better off holding a flashlight in your mouth. If you want a decent light with a magnetic base, buy one from Delta."
1,Broke on the first try,"We purchased this as a fun gag gift and it broke the first time we used it. The vendor was very nice, but the product isn't worth the money..."
4,Great toy for the dog,"Hi---we bought this toy for our Boston terrier and she loves it. The dog obsesses over it oddly enough, The drawback is the chicken sound is a little much but I took care of that with a quick poke at the speaker. NOT for aggressive chewers. The little terrier was fine but when our German short-hair pointer got a hold of it, it was gone. Fun product A must for dogs. Maby one without a speaker.--thanks"
2,It's no flying monkey,"I bought a lot of flying monkeys for Christmas 2008. They flew well & made a great noise when launched. The chickens didn't fly nearly as well & the sound was more erratic. On the other hand, I bought them because they were very inexpensive & I needed 30 for what were, basically, gag gifts."
4,Good Toy,"It's a fun toy but not very well made, the voice box only works half the time and the head came off the first time we used it. But my nephew said there were no such things as flying chickens and we had to prove him wrong."
3,"Cute, but not far flying","Toy is very cute, but not as far-flying as I thought it'd be, of course I could have done something wrong. Then again, I'm not quite a child (age-wise!). Was bought as more of a joke for a farmer friend anyway. It is very cute and makes a cute cluck when flung."
5,don't pass on it,"This toy is the best, I got 2 of them for my kids. The monkey is funny but is a little hard to get a adults fingers in the hole. The chicken is better to use for the quick firing. The sounds they make and the distance that they shoot are awesome. I can't say enough, my kids love them, my wife loves them and I love them. everyone that comes over and sees them loves them. Fun for all and durable. don't pass this little toy up."
5,Great Gag Gift,It was great fun watching my sun shoot this little guy around the house. He was on his way back to college with plans to enjoy it even more with his friends.The cock-a-doodle-do was a bit startling !
4,Great Toy!,"We bought this along with the ""flying monkey"" for the kids last Christmas. They weren't very impressed with them but me and my husband have loved playing with them. They are too hard for young children to shoot off their fingers and still sort of hard for grown-ups, but you can send them flying many feet through the air! I like to stand on our back deck and shoot them out into the woods over the trees and send the kids out the fetch them back so I can do it again. The screams are hilarious! Only drawback so far is that when the battery dies I can't replace it unless I try ripping into it to see if I can do it that way. There is no access to battery replacement. The monkey's battery died and it's just not nearly as much fun without the scream.Great for grown-ups to play with!"
5,A great way to get started,"I recommend The Beginner's Guide to Natural Living to my patients because it encapsulates all the things I would want them to know at the outset: vibrant health comes from living a more natural lifestyle, and Mr. Cook brings it all together in an easily digestible form. The book is comprehensive but readable, practical and thoughtful. For my patients to have success in healing, I always prescribe dietary changes such as those advocated by Mr. Cook - eating whole foods, organic foods and less processed foods. This book also gives good research as to why eating such foods promotes healing and health. The sections on supplements and health food shopping are particularly useful and easy to follow. If someone is looking to get healthy or reverse a disease process, adopting the principles in this book is a great way to get started.Simon Barker, NDPasadena, CA"
4,Great beginner book,I have been teaching myself guitar from various sources for about 9 months and this was the first book that actually got me to read music and not tab(there aren't any tabs to follow). There is also a good linear progression and enough theory used so as not to overwhelm the reader. Most of the songs in the book are familiar enough so that you know what they are supposed to sound like without the enclosed CD. The CD is still very helpful for all the exercises. I have since bought 3 more books in this series but have yet to finish them all.
2,Chord chart is wrong,"This book ok for basic notes, but not a book for learning chords. First of all, this book does not show you how to do the chords AND the chart they give you is wrong! It doesn't show the correct configuration for which strings should not be strummed during a chord. For days I'm using the chord chart in this book as a reference only to find out I'm strumming strings that I should not have."
5,A must for any Yazoo fan.,"I found it very interesting hearing the way Situation sounded when it was first released, before Francois Kevorkian remixed it and it became the famous version we all know today. The version on this CD single has much more of an underground club, Minimalist Funk, sound then the version we know today."
1,Far too big for size 14 and size 12.,The size was too big and did not mach the size sheet.Not acceptable.
1,Not happy with this battery!!,This battery does not hold a charge for more than 30 pictures with my panasonic camera. My original battery is three years old and is still good for 200 or more pics. I bought the new battery for a backup for the older battery. I feel I was ripped off with this purchase. Another fine product made in China!
1,Amazingly depressing,"That was not entertaining. Some of the science was interesting, but it wasn't worth it."
2,"Intriguing science, unrelentingly bleak epic","Baxter is the master of this emerging genre--brilliant and endlessly surprising science welded into a sealed tomb of a story. What irritates me are the highly misleading reviews that speak about the ""Grand Tradition"" of Asimov, Heinlein, and Clark because those masters were all driven fundamentally by hope and optimism whereas Baxter's ethos in both Titan and Moonseed is thoroughly postmodern. In fact Titan documents the collapse of modernism in a just-around-the-bend America that must reach back to the massive, creaking technology of abandoned NASA mega-machines with an achingingly detailed noble attempt to save humanity that ends, quite literally, with a lump of human feces as the seed of a ominous future. Brilliant... but I think that the tool of creative science is only a chimera here. Then again, perhaps it's all an excercise in postmodern irony. If so, I want my money back."
2,Excellent science in a depressing book,The science in this book is the only thing that deserves any rating at all. The politics shows a penchant toward the absurd. The characters and plot are all depressing and not very realistic. The most realistic part of the book is the consequences that follow from the characters incredibly stupid actions.
3,"Starts well, falters, recovers, then dies horribly","Baxter's Titan is just about half of a good book.It starts well, with an all-too believeable crash of the space shuttle Columbia leading to a total shutdown of the manned space program. It then quickly falters, with an incredibly sketchy buildup to the launch of the Titan mission and an utterly ridiculous plot line where the Air Force decides to shoot down the mission(!?).Luckily, Baxter recovers and the actual mission details are both interesting and poigniant. Somehow, the thought that the mission really is going to be one way adds a nice pathos to an otherwise stock plot.The end, frankly, is awful. Stupid and implausable, the book should have ended with the end of the Titan mission.Baxter can write interesting, believeable SF when he wants. Too bad he only wanted to do so for half the book."
3,Stephen Baxter books are all the same,"Prior to reading Titan, I had read the other Stephen Baxter books, The Time Ships, and Ring. Titan is a good book in its own right, but after reading it I noticed something. Stephen Baxter books are all the same. Yeah, the characters are different, the places are different, and the technologies are different. But they're all just different tellings of the same story. In some way or other, mankind dies. In the Time Ships, we were replaced with machines. In Ring, the Xeelee defeated us. In Titan, we destroyed ourselves. And then the last human(s) alive somehow escape(s). In the Time Ships, escape was into the past. In Ring, into an alternate universe, and in Titan, into the future via resurrection."
4,Highly recommended,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As some other reviewers have written, it's the closest any of us will ever get to being on Titan. The science seems accurate to me as a layman with a healthy interest in space, and the descriptions of space flight are very well done. The characters aren't the most fascinating I've ever read about, but the two main ones do grow on you, and by the end, you feel some warmth for them. The parts of the book that were least enjoyable were the parts that took place on earth, but I rushed through those and was rewarded by the descriptions of the mission and Titan."
2,"Comfortable shoe, but poor quality!","This is the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned, but it is lacking in quality. I only had this shoe for 4 months and used 6 times. The stiching has already come out and the shoe had to be thrown away."
5,"Finally, math she enjoys!","Definitely a ""must have"" for parents of high ability children who need an engaging and creative approach to math concepts. My daughter (8 yr.) simply will not complete worksheets, workbooks, or any other repetitive math drill, but she certainly does love a good cat story! For Christmas she received this book and The Adventures of Penrose, plus Fractals, Googols, and Other Math Adventures. She loves these stories, and is drawn into the exercises with enthusiasm. Ms. Pappas has created an original and adventurous series that ""has just the right amount of facts and fun"", to quote my daughter. Partner this series with the book ""The Number Devil"" by Hans Magnus Enzenberger, which is also a favorite in our home."
4,Coromega excellent,I have had such pain in my knees. This product is wonderful! I can tell the days I forget to take it.
4,"tastes decent, great for kids!","I bought this product for my toddler. I take omega supplements myself in capsule form and am happy with it, but I wanted something for her. I am sure her diet is lacking in omega fatty acids, even though I try to force as much salmon as I humanly can upon her. I found this supplement and thought I'd give it a try. It comes like a ketchup packet you tear open and squeeze. I keep it in the fridge, and squeeze it onto a spoon for my daughter. It's a bright orange color and the taste is evidently pleasing to her. She eats it no problem. She asks for her ""omega vitamin"" constantly. So coming from a picky toddler, this product gets a big thumbs up!"
4,Great batteries,"I bought these batteries for my flash on my DSLR, I'm extremely happy with them and the Maha Powerex Wizard One MH-C9000 Advanced Battery Charger and Analyzer I also bought from Amazon. They have a long charge life and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a charger for photography."
1,Very poor holding power,"If you are going to use the batteries within a few hours of charging, then these are okay. They loose charge significantly (almost to unusable) if left overnight after charging. I bought quite a few based on the reviews and was very dissappointed with its performance. Complete waste of money and missed opportunities if you are relying on these batteries. I charged 16 of them and took them with me to a photography shoot the next day, and they were completely drained when I tried to use them. After recharging them, I was able to use it as long as I used it within a few hours of charging. I replaced them with the eneloop batteries which are really good. I am buying more of the 2500mAH eneloop batteries today. The 2700mAH rating on these batteries mean nothing if they self discharge completely by the next day or two."
1,Less than a year use...,"Though they worked very nicely when I originally bought them less than a year ago, they no longer hold a charge AT ALL. I have kept them charged when not in use, switching out one pair for the next when needed in my digital camera. I just switched them over and the ""fresh"" set doesn't work at all now."
1,Will not keep a charge,"I bought these batteries due to online reviews and testing. However, the four I purchased have not lived up to the hype. All rechargeables leak off to some degree, but these have a hard time keeping a charge beyond two weeks, regardless of use."
1,Not good,"I read about these on a blog and how they were the bees knees in batteries, but they really are not that good. They don't hold a charge for very long."
2,Bad cell,"Got the batteries to compare against my 20 or so Eneloops that have many recharges on them. I use the batteries for caving lights, and generally run down 8-12 batteries in a weekend depending on my time underground. I threw them in my Lacrosse Bc-700 right away and refresh/charged them at 500ma. All 4 batteries looked good and I threw them in my light for the upcoming trip (the next day). All went ok, but my normal 5 hr burn time was like 2 hrs with the Powerex's. When I got home, I threw them back on the charger and one cell was dead. I tried what I knew, but I couldn't get it to recharge, or even to read that a battery was there.Right now, I'm testing the other 3 cells for capacity so I'll post back with those results, but I think I'll stick to Loops for now, as faulty batteries could leave me in a real bind underground.I think I got a bad cell, and that's probably why the burn time for my lamp was so short. I'm gonna rate them at 2 stars."
1,Dangerous batteries,"Bought 2 - 4 packs of AA batteries. When recharging them, they got so hot I couldn't handle them. Called the company. Their reply was, ""No idea what is wrong"".Never, ever again will I buy Powerex batteries !!"
5,K&N Rules,"Got this for my wife's Odyssey. Easy install and never need to buy another filter, just clean this one. Runs well."
4,Excellent Digestive Aid,"This item was recommended to me by my Chiropractor to help me digest proteins and carbohydrates. I noticed a difference within a few days. If you're a little older and need help with your digestive process you might give Zypan a try. It worked well for me. Having stated that, you must remember, not every metabolism is the same."
4,Good medicine and,exactly what I needed to help calm down and digest my foods. I feel my body has out grown it's liking for the medicine so I have a few left for when the next person in my family desires to get their acid under control
5,Great tool for teaching,This is a great way to quiz children on note names in a fun way. Easy to use and kids are intrigued by the note moving.
3,Not as informative as I expected,"There is nothing wrong with Kahn's writing, I was just disappointed in how little real information about the Chingis Khan regime was in it. I was expecting details on battle strategies, more background on his relationship with Borte and his sons, and stuff like that. It was a lot more about who was put in command of which tribe, what color people's horses were, and things like that."
2,"I so very much WANT to love these diapers, but they make it impossible!","I have tried them in different sizes and at different stages in my 3 year old son's life. I love the fact that they have no gel, but they REALLY MUST figure something out with the closures. They are totally impractical for everyday use. The largest size doesn't even fit around my son and he is not a chunk. I just can't understand why after so many complaints they can't seem to come up with a solution."
1,DON'T BUY THIS FAULTY EDITION!,"The single star is for this edition, not the play itself, which is Genet's only true theatrical masterpiece--as his true masterpieces are otherwise his novels. PAGE 120 OF THE BOOK IS BLANK! That's right, so stay away from this one until a new printing comes out. I contacted the publisher personally, and all current copies share the defect. No date has been set for a reprint. I would commend the original French to able readers. The play contains notable amounts of prose poetry that translations tend to butcher--as they also, for some mysterious reason, tend to do the play's emotional impact; the French is much more touching."
5,Buy it!,"The photos in this book are beautiful and inspiring. I cannot read it without wanting to make sushi.Contents include under these major categories:-Basics-Making-EatingThe best part is the simple and clean photography, especially of the fish which the show what they look like both whole (scales and all) to cut up.The ""pressed sushi"" section is my favorite, very impressive!"
5,Perfect for my costume,I searched high and low for a hat to go with my Carmen Sandiego costume for Halloween and this fit the bill! I got many compliments on it. Very well made!
4,Easy to Assemble,"This stand went together easily and provides adequate support for display and storage of cooking pots. I wasn't sure of the sturdiness of the stand because it was priced somewhat less than comparable stands, but I'm quite pleased with it."
2,Sturdy but chipped and peeling,"Easy enough to assemble and fairly sturdy for holding cast iron pots (although not as large as I'd like), but the finish is chipped and peeling and generally cheap looking.Ok product for the price - I've seen these for a lot more, but it could really use a decent coat of paint."
4,"old dutch 60-inch cookware stand, graphite","We like it, because it made room for pots and pans, our onions, potatoes and fruit!It's sturdy and fits just fine in our kitchen"
1,Don't like it. It's too small,"It's short and small. It runs so narrow on the top, and I could only utilize the bottom two shelves for my pots. It's no only narrow but short. Well, it's kind of my bad that I didn't really read the dimensions before i bought it. It's only 60 inches. I would expect it's taller than me. The whole purpose of buying a pot stand is to save the space, but for such a short and narrow stand, you can't do much. If not that it's a heavy item and I don't want to spent too much on the shipping, I would return it right away."
3,Valuable Piece of History,"This is a recording of Sir Elton from his earliest days. These songs pre-date Your Song. They are interesting interpretations of songs that were popular at the time they were recorded. It was not unusual for new artists to perform the hits of other performers. It was what their audiences often wanted and presented consumers with something recognizable from a new talent. Now that Elton has matured as a performer and composer, there is no 'need' for him to cover the songs of others. These covers for the most part ARE NOT faithful to the originals. Elton has sung these songs like the Reg Dwight of 1970 would have (and obviously did). For this purpose, the CD should be looked upon as a time-piece, not a NEW album that is somehow 30+ years old."
5,great quality and fit for an even better price!,"I bought this suit for water aerobics and water running. It offers fantastic coverage - no tugging needed - and due to the back ""x-strap,"" support is better than most other swimsuits I've come across. The price can't be beat and after wearing it every week 2-3 times for a couple months, no pilling or stretching out either."
5,Love them!,"I originally bought the brown and gold in a size 7. I am a true 7.5 but I have skinny feet, I was afraid the 8 would be too wide. When I got the sandals they were too short. So I returned them and bought the 8. I love them they are the most comfy pair of sandals ever!! I am going to get them in every color!"
4,reef shoes,"i purchased these shoes for my wife, as most women are she's a shoe fanatic. she said the shoes were comfortable so she wore them to work. after 8 hours she did complain of some foot pain. for normal use they would be great."
5,Fish oil that isn't fishy,I've been using Coromega for a month now so I can't say for sure how well it's working yet but I can tell you that there is absolutely no fishy taste and it tastes great. My 6 year old hates it however. She wants me to purchase the Barlean's Omega Swirl still for her.
5,great product,"I have been taking coromega 3 for 2 years and it has helped to lower my cholesterol . It has a pleasant orange taste and is very easy to take and no fish oil ""burp"" afterwards. I am a nurse and have recommended this product to many people and they also are happy with the results of lower cholesterol."
5,Easiest way to get fish oil into a child!,"I tried a few different fish oil products with our daughter, and this is the only one that she will still take. The orange flavor is pretty good and my 2 year old will take it without any fight. That's a winner for me! And Amazon had the best price that I found, especially with their Subscribe and Save program."
5,Great health product,"This is a great way to get your Omega-3 supplement. Because of it being in liquid form you are getting better benefits compared to a pill. The taste is fine, even if you didn't like the taste, the quantity is so small it would be no problem to take everyday. I have no problem taking it everyday, I actually like it. If you are interested in good health and nutrition this is for you."
4,Fish Oil that taste like fruit,"This product is more expensive than the fish oil capsules but taste better. I have had no after taste so far. You only have to take one packet a day rather than two fish oil capsules to get the 2,000 mg you need. I cannot comment on the effectivness but I cannot comment on the capsules either."
5,Great Taste,"I've been having one a day for the past few months and these are highly enjoyable in the morning. Unlike the pills, you barely taste the fish oil. I highly recommend these."
3,Types of fish in product,"I have been spending hours reading up on this product. Below in the discussion area, someone mentioned: ""Go to [...] where you will find anchovies and sardines as source fish."" As much as I wish to purchase this product, I am going to continue my research before giving it to my child."
4,mr.c,"Coromega Omega-3 Supplement, Orange Flavor, Squeeze Packets, 90-Count BoxI can not evaluate this product for a few months to see if it helps or not!"
5,LOVE these clips!,Clips snap right into place and hold curlers tightly. I love them. I wish there were more than 10 to a box--needs to include at least 12.
4,Jason Crandell's awesome!,"The pace of this video is what makes it so appealing to both beginners and seasoned yogis. I love Jason Crandell's easy demeanor and flow between the poses, nothing feels rushed. I was introduced to him via YogaJournal's online videos and fell in love with his teaching style. Each session feels complete enough that you could just do one or combine all three depending on you needs for the day. Unlike some other videos where I found myself having to watch it on its own several times to get a feel for the poses or sequences I could just pop this one in and follow along."
2,Chronicles of the Crusades,I really didnt like this book . I gave it a chance . But it keep remainding of a classroom text book. I would have like it better had it had a format more for grown ups...
1,Too small to be more than a collectable.,I bought this bag for my son to use for school but it is to small to fit anything in it.
4,A good primer on the subject,"This is one of the better books on interactive game design, and makes a good introduction to the subject. The authors are familiar with a wide variety of game genres and discuss them intelligently.It reads well and is quite comprehensive, and the fact that the authors are clearly familiar with many recent games, and use them as examples, makes the book stronger.I'd suggest someone interested in this career get this book, along with Eddie Dombrower's ""Art of Interactive Entertainment Design"" as two good choices to understand the issues and processes involved in putting out games."
2,Professional? I expected more.,"I expected more from a book titled ""Professional Microphone Techiques"". This book would be usefull for someone just starting to record music, but if you have even a modest level of experience with mics and mic techniques don't look here for any insights. Topics include basic mic types, 3:1 rule, prox effect, freq. response, an almost too expansive list of suggested mic positions of various insturments, eq suggestions, basic compression uses. CD included with the book is a nice touch."
5,One of the best to learn!,"Is a very good book. That is what wizard made. The book give you a solid foundation. If you want to learn fast, then this is the book for you! Of course, if you want to come in deep more, included studio and live recording, synthesizer programming, mac & pc recording softwares, how to eq effexts and mastering, designing your CD covert, making your video clip, o just promoting, copyright, publishing, biggest resource and so on, try to buy ""Music Technology & Live Sound"" plus ""Music Marketing"", a pair of cheap books bilingüal (spanish and english)...I use this 3 books a lot. You must read its!!!"
1,"A gamer in Gaithersburg, MD","If I could give this game a half star, I would. I love simulation games and was hoping that this one would be a newer version of Detroit (by Impressions many moons ago), but was very disappointed. It is hard to keep track of what is going on. Could use better reports. It locks up. Once while trying to exit, it hung and I finally had to shut it down through Task Manager. When you pop the CD into the drive, it tries to start installing again. Obviously not programmed smart enough to know that the game is already installed. And the movies at start up, where do I begin? Sitting through them once was more than enough. There is no way to skip through them, either, as I hit most every key on the keyboard as well as doing mouse clicks. Very bad game. Do not waste your money."
1,Sound Not Synchronized,The movie is great but the sound is typical of an early Japanese monster or Kung Fu movie. A movie that shows the actors lips moving then the sound comes out several frames later. Is there not some company out there that can reproduce this great classic Spencer Tracy movie with better quality than this foreign attempt?
1,Poorly Designed Game,The game is very poorly designed. The pegs are very flimsy and don't fit into the holes tightly. They keep dropping off at every slight touch. Its very annoying.
1,wasted money!!!!!!!!!!!,i just came from a record store! and i bought this cdthis is one of theworst metal album ever! horrible production the vocalist try to sound like u.d.o. from accept.this is a warning for you!!!!!dont buy it as simple as that!!!!!!!
5,turbo cooker is great,Just like the commercial it works. no lies. i cooked a steak in 12 minutes with vegies great meal. Worth every penny. I now want the Turbo Grill .
1,Total waste of money,Everything took twice as long to cookor ended up burntI would not recommend this product to anyone
4,My experience with owning a Turbo Cooker,"I have owned a Turbo Cooker for 8 months now. It truly cooks just like they show in the info-mercials. It cooks frozen solid chicken breasts, pork chops & steaks in no time at all. I cooked a frozen steak for my son in about 15 minutes & it was perfect. The lid practically rinses clean, so the only part to wash is the inside of the pan.The only thing that I am not happy with is that the black teflon is wearing away on the inside bottom from washing, & the steamer rack has a little rust in the corners from where I didn't get it completely dry. I recommend this product, but be careful with what you choose to wash it with."
4,Turbo cooker rocks!,"Most of the junk you see on tv infomercials is just that: junk. This is the rare exception. The turbo cooker is an excellent all-around cooking device that allows very fast steaming, stir-frying, and just about anything else you can do on a stove top. We've had one for several years and it's my wifes favorite pan. Like all the teflon-coated stuff, though, after years of use and an occasional ""oops"" (meaning badly burned food), it was time to send her pan to the trash bin. This meant an immediate assignment for me to replace it. Fortunately, Amazon had them in stock! This is one pan you won't regret purchasing."
5,Daughter Loves this!!,Very happy with this purchase. My daughter loves this program and I have actually enjoyed watching it with her.
2,Do not buy these! They are awful.,"These diapers are a pain for two main reasons; The tabs do not stay stuck, if they stick in the first place. And you can not tell when they are wet. I have had to take the diaper off more that once to check, and the thrown it away when I couldn't get it to stick again. They are not completely biodegradable either. It's not worth the inconvenience. They get two stars from me because they are natural fiber inside and because they are chlorine free, as all diapers should be."
1,Be careful!,"The tabs to close the diapers are a hard plastic that can cut you and your baby. Don't want to take a chance so unfortunately I won't be using them anymore. This can easily be improved if the manufacturer wanted to. Also, I change my babies diapers at least every 2-3 hours and I had three diaper leaks in 2 days."
4,Pot Rack,"We purchased the chrome pot rack. It was a very good quality item. I only ranked it as four stars because we had to reassemble it - the back bar assembly was upside down. Other than that, very happy with the item."
4,Tricky to put up but nice otherwise,This was kind of a headache to put up. Because of the curved frame getting a standard screwdriver in there was very difficult. I don't think it would be possible to put it up with just one person as someone needs to hold it up while the other person screws in. We used an anchor rated for 80lbs on the top hole. Once the struggle of getting it was over it works very nice and is perfect for storing all my pots and pans in my small apartment.
5,Awesome addition,Amazing pot rack. This unit was easy to assemble and is extremely sturdy. The polished copper is great with any color and is very functional. Exactly what I was hoping for. No more in and out of the cabinets.
2,Functional but unattractive,"I do not recommend the copper version of the Old Dutch Pot Rack. The pot rack's bars are shiny copper, but the hooks to hang the pots from are shiny brass finish. The grid on which to store your pot lids is matte black. The total effect on my eyes of mixing the three finishes, is painfully clashing. The shiny brass hooks would be very visible because they hang down from the shiny copper bar to support the pots. I could not bear to put this on my wall. The pot rack also arrived without the three screws that are supposed to be included for attaching the rack to the wall. Caveat emptor."
3,Iron Tek Glutamine,Best price for this supplement. Helps to recover after heavy exercise. I would buy again and again. I recommend it.
4,A fun read in classical Japanese literature,"The Taiheiki (Tale of the Grand Pacification) is one of the Japanese war epics. Not to be confused with The Tale of the Heike, the most famous of all the military romances, The Taiheiki has a charm of its own. There are several heroes, of which the samurai warrior Kusunoki is the most sympathetic. Kusunoki is motivated by loyalty and duty rather than ambition, and he uses his wits as well as his brawn to defeat his enemies as he fights in the service of the Emperor.The Taiheiki is not great literature, but it is a rollicking good tale that is fun to read. It should appeal especially to young men who may run out of patience for the poetry and refined sensibilities of the loftier works of Japanese literature. The Taiheiki has battles and seiges, acts of derring do and even a certain amount of humor, which makes it a relatively painless way to impart historical information."
4,Good,"I am pleased with the fan, after i installed i love the look it gives my case. the red fan matches with the red theme i have going with my case and desktop area. most importantly it runs quiet. i have two of them set up in a push pull config for my corsair cpu cooler and they normally run at 100%. at low speeds the fans are barely noticable, at high speeds you hear them but it is not like my old fans that you can hear screaming in the case. so overall i will def recommend to anyone you wants a good fan that also looks good."
3,"Nice pictures, but lacking in content","This book is, indeed, what its title claims it to be: pictorial. The pictures are good, so if you want to feast your eyes on the lovely Elizabeth Taylor, buy away. But if you're craving more textual content on the fascinating life of Liz, look elsewhere. The text was pretty wooden.....which is amazing, given the excitement of Liz's life."
4,Fun Book for Kids,"The cover is a bit misleading and seems a bit skimpy but the book is well written and has lots of information, images, drawings, and projects. Just has some good basic information on the art of siege engines with a timeline and history of siege engines.Just a nice blend of history, engineering, and actual projects. It's a nice way for kids to learn about catapults. The point is to not just read but to also do."
2,Definitely not worth the money.,"I was really dissappointed with this book. Several of the projects are ridiculous, and he didn't do enough research. A few quick searches of the internet reveal that he gets a lot of historical facts wrong.His first two projects, have nothing to do with anything related to actual catapults. The first is two sticks tied together, and the second is the equivalent of a waterbaloon slingshot. He calls it the ""Viking Catapult"". Of the ten projects in this book, three of them are modeled on actual historical types of catapults. Two are sub projects, that just show you how to build parts of the catapults, and the other five are things a child could design on thier own. As the one of the other reviewers pointed out, the last project is a plastic spoon catapult game. Small children do this on their own.Do your self a favor, and download some free plans off the internet."
3,Sized for children,"Just purchased these for painful feet. Put it in my shoe immediately and found it is too small. The ball of foot padding hits me mid-lower arch, does not pad the ball of my foot at all. However it does feel good on my arch area. Wish I could return it for a larger (mens) size, as I wear a 9.5 size shoe. This is sized for a child's size shoe even though it says women fits all."
5,Instant Relief!,"Bought these for my cowboy boots (which is all I wear). Wow - what a difference! My feet used to hurt - really bad - after 10 minutes of standing. These insoles did the trick without sweating like you get from the gel inserts. I used the ""dots"" to secure and they haven't moved. I like the results so much, I bought a set for each pair of boots!"
4,children's book,"This is a nicely produced book, though it is a children's book and I didn't realize that when I purchased the book. The Upanishads are largely philosophical, and this book attempts to put the basics of Vedanta philosophy into simple stories. This is nice for children but waters down the deep and profound philosophy of the Upanishads.There has been greater success in rendering story-oriented Indian teachings, the epics and Puranas, for children."
5,"It works, however-","After you spray it takes this 7 to 14 days to actually kill them, it works but works slowly (same with the Spectracide equivalent product)- been there, done that, for years. They work but in time. ALSO, with both sometimes you simply have to go back over the weeds again for it to work with the really tough ones. To avoid killing grass by using Roundup you have to wait with these products and sometimes go over it again.... face of life. However, this works fine- as well as any of them."
2,Didn't work...,"I like the pump part of the thing, but the liquid stuff that is suppose to kill the weeds didn't work at all. I have more weeds now before using this. My neighbor himself even told me the product doesn't work as he tried it also."
5,Bravo!,"This richly satisfying conclusion to Star Commandos is bittersweet -- ending as it were an engaging series of adventures with down-to-earth characters who hold the reader's attention and heart. Pitted against the threat of piracy and a shaky alliance between the Empire and Federation, the commandos meet the challenges head-on in both their professional and personal lives. The War-Prince in exile lives up to his honorable name and finds peace within a tight circle of friends, bringing opposing forces together with hope for the future. Bravo PM Griffin from a well-contented reader!"
3,Disappointed,"Like another reviewer here, I bought the Toshiba W727 based on its supposed ability to work with the cable box to change the channel on the box. Even with an old analog box I couldn't get the feature to work. I thought maybe it needed a newer box, so today traded in my analog box for a digital box, and of course it can't switch the channel on that, either. I've spent several frustrating hours over the past few days trying to figure out this problem, only to now find that there's no way this VCR is going to change those cable channels!I've also found the manual difficult to follow, though if you can figure out where to start, once you get to on-screen programming that's pretty clear. I haven't dared try VCR Plus programming; not even sure I can do it with my cable/vcr/tv configuration.The picture quality, however, has been very good. All in all, though, I kind of wish I'd bought the similarly highly rated and slightly less expensive Sony SLV-N55."
1,Pacific Rim [Junk] !!!,"About nine years ago I bought a Goldstar VCR,I beleive it was the first VCR to break below the hundred dollar barrier it was so [inexpensive] I was affraid to buy it but I did anyway, After Nine Years of Service it turned out to be the Greatest Buy Ever!! The only thing great about the Toshiba W727 is the high speed rewind and the amazing automatic clock which is always in time even after pluging it in right out of the box {You don't have to program it's truely Amazing !!} But after that it becomes a total apiece of JUNK !!! The picture faded in and out from having a signal to having no signal, the sound was just as bad with a low monitone sound that faded with the picture. I put in many tapes with the same results but it wasn't until I put in a brand new tape of Hannabal that I hadn't even seen yet AND IT ATE IT !!!..."
5,Best sandal on the market,"These are clearly the best sandals on the market, and are more comfortable than any sandal, at any price, that I've ever worn, including Keens (and I love my Keens), Eccos, Tevas, etc. I liked my first pair so much I bought a spare pair for the day these die (three years of daily use & counting) just to ensure I'm never without them."
4,"Comfortable, takes some time to get used to","Overall, good fit and comfortable. It took my feet a few days to get used to them, since the strap between your toes is pretty stiff."
5,Bible Dictionary,This book is very helpful in defining words in the Bible that we no longer use in our everyday speach.
3,"If you liked her the first book, you'll like this.","Probably better than the first book, Liriel is developed more deeply in terms of character and her link with Lloth. Obviously with such loyalty to such a goodly man as Fyodor she is likely to have a conflict with her own upbringing, and I feel that even the author has some confusion here as to what she is feeling. Overall, not carried off brilliantly, but worth a read (which I would hardly say about many of the AD&D spawns). Mediocre to above average on style and storyline. I still cannot get my head around the change in a spoilt Baenre princess brought up in the centre of cruel Menzoberran life, sorry."
5,What can I say but GREAT!,"This book picks off right were daughter of the drow left off. The main characters from the first book come back (even Shakti). The plot was wonderful and cunnigham realy did a nice job with this book. and best of all the book gives you the feeling of a satisfactory ending. I'm not saying I hope there aren't more, cause I hope there are. But with Daughter of the Drow I felt the ending was a real cliffhanger, Cunninham realy improves here."
3,I liked it! if only it wasn't so messy....,"I bought this book because I know that she is one of SARKs friends so i guess i expected her to write like SARK as well. It's a good start, I think that she has a lot of potential, especially with her art. I could just look through the book at the pictures and the collages, all of the color, and it sucks you in..Some of the writing though.. its hard to understand. I wanted more coherance.. There were bits and pieces that i would have loved to read more about.. but most of it were fragmented and that disappointed me. I will read Brave on the rocks.. her next book that comes out in August, I just hope that its easier to see.Overall though, she captured the feeling of being a ""girl"" and all of that problems and scary feelings that go along with it. I think you should see it just for the art alone."
1,Too busy!,"I was very much looking forward to reading this book. I met the author at one of SARK's gatherings last summer and was very interested in reading what she had to say. When I opened up the book, however, there was so much stuff (literally) on each page that I could not focus on any of the text. Also, the font is very difficult to read. If you can only take in so much stimulation at a time, avoid this book!"
2,"ah, to hear the thoughts of a self-loathing 21 year old...","Seriously.I got this book when I decided to start journaling my own ordeal with breast cancer. As a former architect, I have some drawing skills still, but they're rusty. So I got this book in order to kick my creative juices into high gear.The pages are all so similar. Similar colors, similar self-depricating thoughts and self doubt, similar media and technique (no, SAME technique and media)While I could appreciate a page or two, a whole book of this ""I hate myself, and I need to be loved"" BS was a bit much.I probably would have churned out a similar, steaming pile at the age of 21, but at 42, I'm looking for more variety, more design elements, more work and less blah-blah about how much she worries about having freckles, (gee, would I offer to trade cancer for freckles? Hmm.) And similar stuff.It's enough to find this at any bookstore and leaf through it in 2 or 3 minutes, you will not devour, or refer back to anything here."
2,A little too depressing for a Self-Help book,"I read Sark I know how she guest-stars Sabrina Ward-Harrison in her books, so I looked forward to reading a copy of Sabrina's book. First off: The art is gorgeous. Really. Her collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the content of the book itself is pretty much a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her dillemas, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality. I do hope she keeps writing (she does have promise and her art is great), but her next piece has more ""arc"" to it from the internally repressed to the externally liberated."
5,Una biblia,"Libro obligatorio para todo el que se dedica a la animacion, ya sea 2d como 3d, siempre es necesario mantener contacto con las raices y los conceptos basicos de la animacion."
3,Seen Better,"Apart from the momentary dream sequences of commentary by various well known industry animators, this book is only a duplicate of Preston Blair's book. In fact it is cheaper to buy Blair's book if you are really interested in learning about animation. This book is more notes on animation rather than a survival kit. If you can afford to have only one book, then Blair would be the better. This comes in as second place. I think Williams would have been better off writing an autobiography than doing this book."
5,Fantastic Book,I recomend this book to both types of animators 3d and 2d. I personally am a 3D guy and used this 2D book to create quality animations. Highly recomend for animators of all levels.
4,Good Read,"Good book, the old english is a little difficult to read. Not sure how well the translation is from the original works."
5,I need my stickies,I'm addicted to these things. I want to have them with in 10 steps of me at all times. Use them daily. Great product and good value buying in bulk.
2,Warning,"You really have to prewash your fabric first or the stones will fall off of some types of fabrics like very pretty rain. Personally I prefer another kind of glue...GemTac, because you don't have to prewash anything."
4,Depends on what you want it for...,"Jewel-It is a good glue for rhinestones and the like. Whether you choose it over its main competitor, Gem-Tac, depends on what you're doing.Jewel-It:Is thickerDries more slowlyTends to blurt suddenly unexpectedly out of the bottle in great gobs. Not sure why this happens, but beware.Gem-TacHas a consistency like a slightly thinned white glueDries much faster than Jewel-ItIs more expensiveOverall I prefer Gem-Tac but either will do the job. One caveat: my experiences are based on gluing rhinestones to paper, not fabric, so I can't speak to durability."
1,Wasting money for dummies - buy this book from me,"You are just as likely to need the assistance of the above referenced title as you are to gain information from this book. It could be re-titled: ""Gardening for Dummies"" and possibly pass muster as a helpful guide. For landscaping - save your money and invest it in plantings. Most of the text is dedicated to construction projects (decks etc.) what plants are good for what purpose (height, width), and the value of good landscaping. Unfortunately the text discussing HOW to landscape effectively is breezed through with only the briefest nod to the MOST elemental concepts. A (with liberties taken) paraphrase,"" You will need dirt. Dirt is available at garden centers. Plants will not grow without it, so make sure you have some before you attempt to establish your plants."" For any but the most significantly stupid, this book is useless for the purpose it alleges to serve. I would have given it a ""0"" star rating, but that isn't an option."
4,4.47 not a 4.0 nor 5.0,"Because there's a huge difference between an A+ and an A-, I'm going to start listing more specific numbers for these ratings of mine. Hope this doesn't bother anyone too much.This book, though it gives wonderful information about Alec and Seregil...particularly Seregil's past, is not as rich as the first book was. It feels like it lacks something. Perhaps it is lack of the rich, delicious culture, the witty remarks, the flourishes and tricks which Seregil played in book one that are lacking. It is not that the books is completely lacking in these areas, but that there seems to be less of it. There are sections in the book that deal deeply with Seregil's past--that is both good and bad. Good in that we learn more about Seregil. Bad in that after a while, it almost becomes a Speak, Memory Chapter Three. Oh, the really interesting thing about this is the development of Nysander's apprentice. You'll see. Telling too much more would perhaps, ruin this book."
3,Not the best of her work,"This was my last read of all the Flewelling books. I actually started with the later series first and made my way back. I love her books, I love her writing, I love her characters...........just not in this book. I had to keep reminding myself that these were the same characters from the first two books in the series, so far removed were they from their original surroundings. This book is all about politics and names and words you probably can't pronounce. This in itself usually doesn't bother me, but overall the story fell flat. I think the problem lies in that, as Flewelling states, this isn't meant to be a trilogy. As a standalone novel though, the book falls short too though, although that's how you feel when you read it. If you've read the first two books in this ""series"" I would suggest just leaving this one alone."
5,Great Software...Great Company,"The more I learn about this software and the company that created it, the more impressed I am. They created the first version 12 years ago and cooking software is all they do.Rather than selling upgrades every six months to make a buck, they fix problems and add new features on a monthly basis and let all of their customers download updates for free. What more could you ask for?I bought this because it sounded neat but now I must say that I'm a believer. The software works great and the company supports the product very well. They send me a free monthly newsletter with cooking tips and recipes that I can download right into my software. The President himself even gives out his e-mail address and encourages his customers to send feedback.I've checked out some of the other brands like MasterCook but none of them even come close to Cook'n.I highly recommend this product."
3,COOK'N IS FRUSTRATING,"I'VE USED THIS SOFTWARE FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS AND SOMETHING IS ALWAYS GOING HAYWIRE WITH IT. RIGHT NOW I CANNOT ACCESS MY COOKBOOK CHAPTERS AND OFTEN THE RECIPE WILL NOT PRINT OUT IN ITS ENTIRITY. IT SEEMED TO WORK WELL FOR A WHILE, BUT NOW IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TO USE. I DID REALLY LIKE IT AT FIRST, BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANY HELP IN FIXING THE CURRENT PROBLEMS. I'M READY TO CHUCK IT IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER PROGRAM. (WIFE OF ROBERT)"
1,Fatal error day 2,"After spending a couple hours entering my own recipes, I received a fatal error and have not been able to open the program again. I don't plan to continue using this software and I wouldn't recommend it.In addition, I did contact the software support. To their credit, they responded in a timely manner. Unfortunately, they only were able to tell me what I already know which was that my data was lost and there was no way to retrieve it."
2,Not what it's cooked up to be,"I found this software very user unfriendly, difficult to naviagate and very time-consuming to attempt to utilize. The window for recipe addition is easy to use but that is the only thing easy to use. There are better choices out there."
1,VERY UNHAPPY WITH SERVICE,"I am very new to embroidary and this was my first purchace. After I ordered they immediatly said they were out of stock, but Amazon showed that they still had stock, and they tripled the price! Why lie?? Tell the truth next time you cancel my order! Your name is now ""embroidered"" on my mind....I won't be dealing withyou again!"
4,A must have for True Aviation Buffs,"I was surprised by this DVD. I expected it to be a broad brush of early Aviators but found it focused more on the great manufacturers, e.g Boeing, Douglas, et.al.Very educational plus entertaining.Glynn .."
2,Disappointed,"I love the fact that these bags are made with a high percentage of recycled material.However, they are thin and tear very easily. I ended up putting less content in them and therefore using more bags than the ones I used previously. I am quite disappointed."
5,Recycled plastic! GREAT if you don't overload!,"I LOVE having a product that contains so much recycled plastic! Complete the recycling loop! These bags can't hold up to overloading, but for ordinary kitchen use, they are great. Recommended!"
5,Great bags,I've been on auto-delivery for some time now. The bags are fairly strong and the price is great. Also a plus in helping our environment.
3,Rip Easily,"Glad they are recycled, but it's lost cause when you need to use a second bag when the first one splits down the side. Do not put anything heavy in the bag. They cannot handle it. Almost no tensile strength. I won't be buying these again."
5,Cargo loks,Ordered these because items would roll around in the back of our SUV. These keep items in their place. Couldn't be happier.
2,Didn't work for me,"The Velcro on these little blocks really wouldn't attach to my cargo mat liner. Maybe it's just me, but the reality didn't meet my expectations."
1,"Sadly, It's Just Terrible","Please don't read this if you have a love of history or hope to attain one! If you have no knowledge of the ancient world at all, perhaps this book won't insult you, and you may proceed without my caution. If, however, you are more accustomed to Plutarch, Josephus,Edith Hamilton, etc - pass this one by and save your reading time for something more worthy.I don't want to insult the author, I just want to caution readers. Excellent and real biographies are lasting, written without emotion or judgement of the time period, containing genuine facts that will enthrall if read in 200 BC or 2020 AD - this one will seem dated and irrelevant in as little as four years."
3,"""Rocabilly Neil""","1 of Neil Youngs ""different style"" recordings. Music is a very personal choice though- ""listen & learn"" works best! The ""same ol' , same ol' "" isn't a learning experience!"
1,14K gold id bracelet--ladies,"Was disappointed in the bracelet. It had a flimlsy attachment to the ID panel and I think was likely to break loose and therefore fall off the wrist.I returned it, insured for a cost of $20, for a credit to my credit card.Bonnie Campbell"
4,Four and a half stars really,"I bought this pan for its size and from blind confidence in the name brand's reputation. I was very pleasantly surprised by what a great value this pan was. It is the perfect size to sautee a few mushrooms, fry some appetizers, or make a small omelette. What worried me the most is the fact that this pan does not have the black, non-stick surface that we have all grown to love. My worries have been laid to rest though, as each time this pan emerges from the dishwasher it is spotlessly clean! I highly recommend this pan."
3,MUST own a dishwasher with this item,"I treated the pan just like I should and though I like the fact that I can put it in the oven and it's a good size, it's difficult to clean."
5,"Souvenir...a charming blend of ska, jazz and latin styles",Souvenir by Japan's Double Famous is a postmodern tour of many music styles that is more a fan's tribute than an ironic comment. One minute they remind me of the Skatellites and the next it might be Nino Rota or Perez Prado...but very 21st century. The playing and production are quite sophisticated and this CD just gets better each time I listen to it.
2,not a favorite,"I found this workout difficult to follow. I have many workout DVDs, and haven't encountered this before; I believe it is due to poor cueing.I don't find it to actually be a total-body workout. It does not excercise the upper or lower back.Not terribly impressed with the music.There are better choices out there. ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" is far more comprehensive, better cue-ed, and more effective.Having tried this once, it's unlikely I will try it again."
3,"Ok for a short workout, not enough for a good workout","I was originally disappointed with this workout DVD because of two things: the length and the workout itself. The bow says it has a run time of about 40 some minutes but in reality, after credits and the beginning intro, it's only a 25 minute workout. And it really doesn't make you work very hard.But, after using it a few times, I has come in handy when I don't have a lot of time and when I just want a good ab workout. It's not very good cardio but does a lot of toning."
1,A waste of good money,"This items is overated, and does not perform up to minimum standards. Battery needs recharging continuously."
5,"Elegant, fleet-fingered, satisying versions of Bach.","I can't honestly tell you that you'll find Murray Perahia's versions of Bach's English Suites any better than those of Andras Schiff, Glenn Gould, or any other pianist. Perahia's CDs are simply the ones I happened to buy, and I find them completely satisfactory, from the standpoint of both Perahia's performances and sound quality. Particularly considering their mid-price status, the Perahia discs are a wonderful buy for anyone who loves Bach performed on the piano."
1,Vegetarian recipes not vegetarian,"The book claims to contain a section on Buddhist vegetarian cuisine, which is the only reason I bought it. Unfortunately on closer inspection I found that every single 'vegetarian' recipe contains fish sauce, oyster sauce or both (dead creatures, in case the author did not know??). Use was also made of products such as bottled Nestle Maggi sauce - clearly not real food. This is enough to tell me that the author's concept of quality food differs vastly from mine and that he probably isn't a real foodie at all - certainly not someone I would trust to give me a high quality recipe. I would love to return the book but I don't live in the States and the postage would probably cost more than the book - this is one that will sit there accumulating dust until some poor soul agrees to relieve me of it."
4,easy and healthy,"I got in the habit of ordering spring rolls everyday for lunch from a Vietnamese market in Oakland. Now I can make them at home. But best of all, this book has engaging stories about Vietnam and American involvement that are not a downer, but an inspiration. Somehow, this young lady lived the American Dream. I am buying more for gifts."
5,the little saigon cookbook: vietnamese cuisine and culture in Southern california;s little saigon,"This was a fascinating book! I felt like I learned so much about the history of Little Saigon, the current and past culture, and the perk of having some fantastic recipes. The text is very well written and extremely informative. The recipes are inviting and, so far, delicious. Its opened up a new type of cuisine for me!"
4,AN INTERESTING READ,"""Love Alice"" offers a lot of insight to the man himself, Jackie Gleason. Along with stories about Gleason's friends and drinking buddies, cast members, writers, and crew members during the Golden Age of Television, the 1950's. It also includes a number of shared memories concerning the filming and production of the earliest episodes of the ""Honeymooners"", of which she was such an intrical part. The only thing I wish Ms. Meadows had included in her book, would be a chapter or two of backstories dealing with each episode of the ""Classic 39"" Honeymooners, sharing behind-the-scenes production trivia of each episode, since I have them all on DVD and enjoy watching them repeatedly."
5,Well worth the money,Works great. Slight mileage increase as advertised. Easy drop in for a noticable power increase. Easy to clean and reusable.
2,Wish it were better quality.,"This pan arrived chipped. I think it may have been packed that way, as I did not find a chip of enamel in the box. Packing not so great--not wrapped, and just tossed in the box with other items that were wrapped and a strip of those inflatable plastic pads. I returned it, as I believe the finish is too vulnerable to chipping (always a concern with enameled cookware) but this struck me as more fragile than some other enameled items I own."
5,hansa kangaroo,this plush is super soft and shapeable. he looks very realistic and my son for whom santa brought this has practically lived with it under his arm since..it is cute/ cuddley and well made.
1,whats to say,fist of all the special effects were bad even for the eightys second the script bit i dont know what they were thinking on that one 3you call this a kids flick ? they left out almost all the characters its been a long time saince ive seen it but as far as i remember they only left in skeletor he-man of course but thats it they didint even have all the origanal veaicles as far as i remember. first time i saw it was prabably 17 years ago anyway who ever directed it i dont mean to sound immuture but they should get thier you know what. kiked and frank langella hes a great actor superb in fact he should of just stayed away from it but he probably needed the money either way ill stay off his back.
2,Oh yeah...oh no...,"With the advent of the remix album came the expansion of the mundane into new and unexciting markets. This is no different. Marked by Plutone's break-breat remix of ""Oh Yeah,"" most of this particular remix album is unimpressive and overproduced. Almost all of the tracks have been sped up beyond all comprehension and hacked into tiny pieces that resemble Yello as much as Johnny Mathis resembles Kylie Minogue. Yello should have had more of a hand in this remix/tribute as it sounds almost nothing like them. There are, however, one or two notable exceptions on the album, such as ""La Habanera,"" and ""L'Hotel,"" which still manage to capture some of the original sound, but they unto themselves are not worth suffering through the rest of this remix-madness."

3,Grossly distorted,"The movie in no way depicts what really occurred. I happened to go to Steinmetz when this happened and know ALL of the parties involved. The movie is grossly distorted. Feel sorry for these cheaters??? I don't think so! They knew exactly what they were doing and lied to everyone about it. No morals, no scruples. I cannot begin to describe the disgrace and disappointment we felt. I keep in touch with some of the ""cheaters"" and they are finally admitting to it but show NO remorse. Sad."
2,"Not Much ""Meat"" to This One","The characters in this story were rather shallow - not well-rounded. I never felt I really got to know them, and therefore the author didn't get me to care about them. Also, the premise, that Bridget had lived all her life among the monks and nobody ever found out, seems hard to believe, even if they were in a fairly isolated area. I almost gave up and quit reading this one."
4,Good follow-up to Vol. 1,"I really enjoyed the matches selected for this DVD, although I think they could have saved the big Joe/A.J./Daniels feud for the end instead of starting out the whole disc with it. I would have liked to see more Petey Williams and some of the big pops that the X-Division matches produced before TNA started killing it. Overall most of the matches are very enjoyable and I hope they produce a 3rd volume."
2,They clipped the best parts,"They clipped and cut matches between the three best X-Division wrestlers today. Of course I am speaking about Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, and Christopher Daniels. There are no triple threats or singles matches with these three.Who clips matches anymore? I mean c'mon?!If you want your fill of the other guys this is your DVD, but I wanted something more well thought out not a best of Sonjay Dutt / Chris Sabin DVD."
3,A non bias review,"I love wrestling. I know WWE is getting stale, but TNA isn't doing much better. I've grown up with WWE, but have grown tired of the company. The next logical step would be TNA, right? I saw it live and wasnt too impressed. X Division is what makes this company run and I got both Volume 1 and 2 for a great deal. I watched it but felt nothing at all. The action is fantanstic but it feels like something is lacking, and all matches seem to be the same; They have a few cool spots, close falls, and a winner. The first dvd was better then part 2. I dont know if i'd recommend it to a WWE fan; Honestly i'm a WWE fan, reviewed TNA, and I think TNA doesnt have anything much better then WWE does right now."
2,Boring predictable death metal,"Decapitated reminds me of Vader's The Ultimate Incantation: it's death metal that has no substance. Yeah, the can play fast and the vocals are deep, but the album goes no where. Their previous album, Winds of Creation, was much better and it is the only Decapitated release I would recommend.When I saw Decapitated live, they were much better than a studio recording."
3,Somewhat Unnatural,"This unique combination of poetry, philosophy, science and history is both enthralling and repelling. Ms. Ackerman is truly gifted and passionate in her descriptive enthusiasm. But she grasps at an evolutionary worldview that is completely unsupported by the facts she so brilliantly uses from a scientific and historical perspective.How delightful is this same sensory world she describes when viewed within the context of a world designed to be experienced and enjoyed by a loving and kind Creator! Rather than being meaningless, nonsensical or ironic, the senses then become more apparent and appropriate for their intended use.The author also tends to infer a sexual aspect to just about every experience she describes, which detracts from the inherent essence of those unique experiences of smell and taste. Though all the senses undoubtedly contribute to our sexuality, this was over-emphasized and distracting."
1,she murders her topic in this book,"I agree with another reader who felt that this was a collection of personal anecdotes that seemed at times far-fetched. It should have been more truthfully titled ""The Natural History of Diane Ackerman's Senses"". I couldn't read the whole thing, it got very cloying and the language tried too titillate more than convey knowledge. I did not care how unruly and sensual her hair is, nor did I care to read about her kissing experiences. You can be sure I'm avoiding her book on Love, too."
4,Different strokes.......,"A Natural History of the Senses is probably not the kind of bookyou might expect a ""real"" guy to read. Well, I am and I did, and I truly enjoyed most of what Diane Ackerman wrote. Unfortunately, like many books, it loses something of its wallop as your read progresses but I found the early chapters sensually intense and explicit to the point of jogging memory of exotic places and scents almost forgotten. In my opinion well worth the invested time. ""Thanks for the memories""."
1,Crap.,"Tedious, cutesy and dull. Cloying and annoyingly precious. No point whatsoever. I read it and gave it away."
2,"Think ""Romance,"" not ""Science""","I was hoping for a book that would contain interesting facts. Maybe somewhat along the lines of Micheal Pollan's The Botany of Desire. Boy was I in for a surprise!Maybe there is some useful information in here, but if so it is buried in a sea of gushing anecdotes and tediously-excessive use of adjectives and parentheticals. After quite a few false starts, I've made it close to halfway through the book, and won't be going any further. This book seems to be well received, but it'd definitely not for me!"
5,Sense and Sensibility,"This is an entirely personal response, but this is one of the most important books I've read. For anyone who tries to live actively through their senses, experiencing the world around them and incorporating a sense memory, this book will satisfy powerful, intuitive feelings. It has just enough science to explain and fascinate, the rest is clear, resonant stories of sensual experience. There is a lucid, sincere and powerful feeling of sheer joy about that book, the joy Ackerman finds in her own experience and her pleasure and sharing, but the book never tips into the sentimental."
2,Don't be misled...,"This book is anything but a Natural History of the senses. Ackerman takes a few scientific facts about the senses and fluffs them up with rambling prose about her own experiences.The more science-oriented passages were superficial and extremely brief, and I found the prose to be monotonous and dry. Other reviewers' description of her prose as ""cloying"" is very appropriate. Her use of imagery and metaphors is at times creative, yet overwhelming, and she offers very little substance to balance it.I can only begin to imagine the thrills of hearing about the luscious and sensual natural history of her garden. Too bad I won't be getting around to reading that one...I give the book two stars instead of one for the interesting factoids she inserts here and there, irrelevant though they may be to the surrounding text. Overall, not recommended."
5,You could not write better fiction!,"However it is not fiction.As much a window into Jackie Kennedy's personality as it is into the Beale's eccentric life.A short watch, then go buy the book.................amazing to think this only happened a few decades ago."
4,The Beales,"After seeing the movie Grey Gardens with Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange, I wanted to learn more about the Edies and discovered that they were, indeed, real people. I had no idea; had never heard of them before. The documentary did a great job of capturing the relationship between this funny, perceptive, and interesting pair. The Edies, while living in absolutely deplorable conditions, kept me watching and listening for what they were going to say or do next, although Big Edie didn't really do much but sit in bed. Little Edie, however, was a constant livewire. I can't wait to watch the original Grey Gardens to see more of this dynamic duo."
3,Not for us,"I bought these after trying Seventh Generation because I hadn't tried any other brand and wanted a change. Of course I read the reviews about them being perforated, I just assumed the person meant that the wipes were folded together to make it easier to pull them out.These are the reasons Tushies wipes are not for me:-No peel-back sticker to remove individual wipes at a time. Once you open it, it's open. I like having the sticker for the package I keep in my diaper bag.-Very wet. When I take out a new package, I squeeze excess liquid out. And there's still enough to last the whole package.-The wipes themselves are thin. Thin wipes plus the wetness make them very flimsy. I end up using at least 1/5 of the package to clean a 'dirty' diaper."
4,Good product but could use one improvement,"I prefer these wipes over regular huggies, luvs, or other regular wipes because they don't have a bunch of potentially hazardous chemicals. These seem to be more moist than Seventh Generation brand which which my wife prefers as she thought the Seventh Generations were at times bordering on being dry. The only improve needed to these wipes is the perforations holes as it is difficult to tear apart an individual sheet with one arm. You pretty much have to use both hands; one to hold the wipe and the other the bag or container to tear apart the sheets. This can be difficult at times when you're trying to keep a baby/toddler from moving.Recommendation to manufacturer: Improve tearability of sheets so they can be done with one hand (Seventh Generation is better in this regard)."
3,I Dig His Playing,I dig His Playing can't say much really as far as His voice goes but His Foundation is very much on time too me.He is a Very Talented Player.you won't get the Minneapolis sound vibe here though.Dr.Fink comes out with something completely different here.
4,"well structured, but needs supplements","Surgery as a field, is wide and developing rapidly, probably publishing textbooks is not a good idea anymore. This book hits and misses in trying to collect the basics for surgical knowledge and more.You'll find many missing points which you can fill from the internet or from magazines or other resources.Most of the chapters are excellent and are probably all what you might need for your college study like those on trauma, diseases of the thyroid and parathyroid, metabolic response to injury etc.. but there are some which are disasterous like the chapter on breast conditions, but probably the subject itself is complex and controversial anyway.The text overall is very well written and the structure and design of each chapter is very logical, some figures are not so great though, plus the book needs an update. you might consider supplementing it with Surgical clinics of north amarica for some of the chapters you read."
2,Not a wonderful tour of the subject...,"I have a library of a couple hundred books on Spirit,spirituality, meditation, life before/after life... andthis is not one of the better ones. It is not very wellorganized, and does not do this serious topic much justice."
5,FANTASTIC! THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!,"This book has had more of an impact on my life than any other book I have ever read. I spent all of my childhood and most of my adult life terrified of death and this fear has now been totally released. Because I now know so much more about my own soul I find myself being more patient, more loving and more truthful in everything that I do. I no longer take on any of the responsibility for other people's actions and feel great joy at being able to release old angers and frustrations. Thank you Echo for touching my life so deeply and bringing me true spirituality."
5,Beautifully Brutal,"I will say that this is a work of art indeed.This gloomy fairytale about revenge is the mostvisual blessing of all time, and it's narratedperfectly.A must for all Crow fans."
3,not so Frightening,"I had really hoped for more of the ""chiller"" effect. As it is, I guess I'll just play the Toccata & Fugue over and over . . ."
3,Where is the Real Jacquelyn Mitchard?,"The Deep End of the Ocean was one of the best books I've ever read. Twelve Times Blessed was one of the worst books I've read and The Breakdown Lane? Not great and not terrible just...disappointing. The story was interesting, engaging and kept me reading, but the dialogue was so unrealistic and stilted that I found myself getting annoyed. Leo and Mark were the kind of one-dimensional stereotypical characters that are often found in ""women's novels"". Mitchard is capable of better. The happy ending was just plain unbelievable--the odds of something like that happening in real life are incredible. Seems to me that Mitchard couldn't figure out how to end the book, so she just tied a pretty bow on it and hoped for the best. Too bad. She's a better writer than this book reveals."
2,Not the best way to learn about MS.....,"As a person with MS, I just want to caution that reading this book would NOT be the best way to become educated about typical MS symptoms, medication or side effects. To give an example, people with MS do not give themselves injections once a month. And the injectable medications are not ""cancer meds."" If you want to get accurate information, look at the National MS Society or another of the excellent groups online or at your library or bookstore. Of course I realize that this is a novel, and not a reference book, but I am disappointed that Ms. Mitchard did not do better research for this book."
4,Mitchard is back in her element,"I read and loved ""The Deep End of the Ocean"". I admired the author's writing style; it reminded me of Joy Fielding and Joyce Carl Oates' ""We Were the Mulvaney's"". Then I read ""The Most Wanted"", this was quite some time ago, and all I can remember about that book is that I didn't care and really didn't even like any of the characters.With ""The Breakdown Lane"", Ms. Mitchard is back in her element doing what she does best and that is telling a story filled with people that could be members of your own family, they are so finely tuned. It is a truly gifted writer that can make one hate someone as much as I hated Leo. It takes a special kind of scuz bucket to do what hew did to his family. Or, on the other hand to admire and love the relationship that Julie and her son, Gabe have.I highly reccommend this book."
3,Not Lorca's Best,"With a near-elementary plot but stunningly poetic language, Blood Wedding is at once Lorca's simplest and most complex play. The simple tale is as old as literature - probably as old as humanity -, and it is hard for one to care much about it on its own terms. There is indeed a noticeable Greek tragedy influence in presentation - i.e., violence being offstage - as well as plot, though Lorca is as ever strongly rooted in Spanish culture. However, the play has perhaps Lorca's least conventional presentation, making it intriguing. It is deliberately unrealistic; a near-surreal air pervades, and there is relatively little prose dialogue. More importantly, it is very symbolic; tropes and figures do not so much accentuate as become essential to the plot. Blood requires close attention to appreciate, meaning it is not the easiest introduction. Thankfully, the lyrical beauty may pull some readers in, leading them to Lorca's stronger and more enjoyable plays."
2,Blood Wedding,"This is going to short, but I found the play below standards set by the author. There is weak imagery combined by poor, ineffective dialogue, yet there are nice character settings. There is a nice story line combining fire and passion in Leonardo's case with love for the bride, yet it is let down by the poor use of language. It is good for reading before bed, but other than that, I'd say ""NO"", like the ""Just Say NO"" drug ads."
4,Great cd!,"I really enjoy listening to this cd - It's full of great, interesting songs. Songs such as ""If a heart breaks"", and ""Damn"" are cheeky, quirky songs that are a humourous way of looking at our world. Reconmended cd!"
3,Entry hole too large for wrens,"This is a cute little bird house, but the hole is way too large for wrens. I will try to find something to put in the circle to make it smaller."
2,WRONG FOR WRENS,"This birdhouse is not correct for house wrens. The entry hole is way too large. This birdhouse would only serve as a sparrow house. The cedar is nice quality, but very fragile and it will break quite easily. If the maker placed a small reinforcing strip inside the removable roof and used a quarter for sizing the entry hole, then this house would be adequate. As shipped now, UNSUITABLE!"
4,High scores on a book well written,"The ""Developers Guide to TAPI"" provides an introduction and selected advanced topics for the windows developer who is a TAPI novice. As a dyed in the wool ""C"" hacker, I found Mr. Sells C++ class library somewhat confusing, but this shortcoming is mine and not Mr. Sells.I believe that the technical material, examples and the method of presentation is a great deal more user friendly than much of the content of the MSDN library series to which I have been a subscriber and user."
4,An original for sure,"The material in this film about a disabled serial killer is very well handled. The direction was excellent for a lower budget film and the acting was spot on - I am glad to have this film in my collection. The story will def. upset those that are easily offended, but this is a genre gem and an original film to be sure. The severe disability the main actor suffers in real life and on the screen brings an emotional kick in the pants with it as the story unfolds and be sure to check out the DVD interveiws of the cast involved!!! I am glad I took a chance on this one."
5,Thomas trains without breaking your budget.,"My son got into these trains at age 2 and when we bought him wooden trains he quickly made short work of them, chipping them and scratching the paint off the wood. That's why I love all these Thomas Take Along trains. The die cast is much more durable than the wooden ones and much more affordable. He can be rough with them, like a 3 year old can, and they are no worse for the wear."
5,"Love to Read, Love to Laugh","I adored this debut novel. I had read the reviews and was prepared for funny, but in places, this novel is hilarious. And Ms. Wilson's take on Southern women is so dead-on. In reading, I had flashes of relatives that were just amazingly accurately depicted. I love it that the protagonist fails her way to success. That just made the book for me. One question remains: When can we read Bertie's next adventure?"
1,1.5 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: The Giggler Ball does not make noise very easily. Mom has to shake it up and down for it to make noise. I have a difficult time getting it to make noise. It seems to be built solidly, but it's not very interesting.Conclusion: Overall its a pretty boring toy. I really like a used Gatoraid bottle more. 1.5 out of 4 Paws because its durable, but very very boring."
5,Great Toy for Blind Dogs,"My blind dog, Tulip, (totally blind, both eyes removed due to acute glaucoma before she joined our family) LOVES this toy!!! In fact, I am ordering another because hers went down the storm drain and she is DESOLATE without it."
5,Great book or entertaining and decorating on the Sabbats,They have some great projects and recipes for all the wiccan holidays. I love the strawberry topiary tree project and will be making it for my next yule party!!!!!
2,boring,"There are a couple of good ideas in this book, but for the most part I found it boring. It doesn't feel like the author is actually pagan. It feels like it could have been written for christian holidays and then just tweaked for pagans- it lacks pagan soul. There are so many better books out there, don't waste your resources on this one."
2,Not What I Expected,"The sleeve on the cover of this book, makes me want to put it out on the coffee table for people to pick up and read. The contents on the other hand, makes me wanna bury it in the yard. I thought this book would be a bit more lively in its writing, have beautiful glossy pictures and get into the background of the sabbats more. Its not at all what I expected."
5,Quite enjoyable and a great gift.,I am neither Pagan nor Wiccan but found this book to be utterly delightful with wonderful recipes and craft ideas. I have given it to two Wiccan friends who were so pleased to finally have a holiday book dedicated for their holidays.
5,A riveting and haunting book!,"One of the most powerful books about warfare I have ever read. One horrible and unforgivable incident leads the reader into a chasm of memory, dysfunction and anger. A true story, written with skill and power, it will repel and fascinate simultaneously. To understand why the Viet Nam war provoked suck passionate reactions, this is the book to read."
4,WHISPER KILL,"SPY, INTRIGUE AND A LITTLE ROMANCE. I THINK YOU WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE. GREAT AUDIO AND VISUAL."
3,Good Product but Not Perfect,The External Driver is a good Product I received it One day ahead of schedule easy to install no drivers needed for it to work just connect the wires in the right places and turn the power on. 1 draw back I have with it is there is no PVR with it I know of. I went to the website to install those drivers but they didn't work and Media center does not work with it. but if you're looking to convert your monitor into a Television or use it to play video games then it's a good propduct to buy. If your looking for more capabilities (such as PVR capabilities) like I was then Look elsewhere
3,Less than expected,"Ordered this item for my college dorm, however the quality of image it displays through my 23-inch LCD is far from making it a TV alternative. Cool design, but has a lot more to do to improve its resolution and easiness to browse all channels."
1,Terribly written,"I'm sure Ms. Keller had a wonderful time in the South of France. But this book conveys none of its splendor. She should get an editor to tame her adjectives and adverbs.In an attempt to capture the effect on the soul of being in the South of France, her prose flattens the whole experience to a loud fortissimo. The result: She sounds like a screaming American."
4,Really cool software,"I have used this product for years, and it works really fine most of the time. You can see and control another computer anywhere. Cross-platform works fine. For collaboration, it's better than being there, because both of you are looking at the same thing and pointing at the same thing but on each your own screen. Two or three people can all log in to the same screen -- and watch the same action -- simultaneously.The only problem is setup. Most people have routers using the Network Address Translation algorithm. The router's NAT has to be configured to route the unsolicited Timbuktu request (TCP port 407) to the correct computer. Farallon provide pretty good instructions on the web how to do this, but it is a pain.All similar products I've tried have this same problem. It's too bad that none of them could figure out a way to fake out the NAT algorithm.--Gil"
3,Mulan 11,I bought this for my niece. She didnt try it for a while after I bought it for her because her player wasn't working right. By the time she tried it she said the end of it had a lot of skips. I didn't contact the seller because of the time that had passed from when I purchased it
4,Great for the kids.,A very intriguing movie and just as good as the first so I actually enjoyed myself and so did my niece. The charaters were well-formed and the plot was engaging anough to hold her interest for the entire movie.
3,"Should have been entitled Mushu, not Mulan II","I loved the original Mulan movie. I had even bought the soundtrack because the music was wonderful. I was extremely disappointed in the second movie. The main reason is this: Donny Osmond did a phenominal job in Mulan. He didn't sing a note in Mulan 2. I must admit that it was good to see the original characters, but without Donny's voice, it flopped."
3,Not quite as good as the original,"The most glaring difference between this and the first Mulan is the absence of Eddie Murphy as the voice of Mushu. Mark Moseley does a good job as the voice this time around, however, if you are of the opinion, like my own, that Murphy's performance in the original Mulan stole the show, then there is a profound difference in the enjoyable quotient between the two. The movie has the all of the essential Disney elements....laughs, songs, and the always present emotional response or two. On the whole the movie is worth viewing and again, provides plenty of the classic Disney entertainment value. It's just missing Murphy."
2,Not as good as the original,"I got this movie because I thought the first one was so fun, I wasn't as impressed with this one. I felt the story line was pretty stupid"
1,Disappointing sequel,"This movie was a terrible knockoff from the first. There was absolutely NO continuity. This movie was apparently about money, becuase it wasn't about values.Why are Disney movies that include women always about marriage? Can women not just be women or heroines without finding a ""man"", or the ""right man"". Why does following your heart always have to include romance? This movie could have been far more interesting without this. And, besides that, the animation was below par. Quite a disappointment."
2,Who fact-checked this book?,"Lots of errors; little real insight; repetitive; written like a college paper. Too bad, because the idea for the book has great possibilities. But what's presented here is often pedantic and sometimes sophomoric. (Dainty June and her on-stage cow have lesbian overtones? C'mon!)"
3,"LITTLE INTEREST FOR THIS ""HUGE"" ADVENTURE","My 9 month old son LOVES the television show ""Little Einsteins."" However, this DVD misses the mark that the television show hits. It doesn't give you its trademark ""Prepare for blastoff"" song until at least 20 minutes into the movie. And the plot is BORING...it does not hold my son's interest like the show does. It seems like this was made before they got the catchy nuances of the show down. Anyway, it's not as interesting as the show by far."
4,"""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush""","11/10/01 Pryor(who always does well when he emphazises 'there's no place like home' as he's done in movies such as the 'wizard'in the Wiz and now in his having to take on an entire new personus once he strikes back at injustices after,for the sake of a good paying CEO job, he moves his wife, twin sons and eventually his errant tenage daughter to Idaho)combined not only his acting and comedic talents, but also great talents of the entire cast(there were no fading stars in this movie)in either the'straight'roles or comedic roles."
3,TOO Sweet to compensate for omissions!,"Ive tried about 5 recipes so far of the cookie and cake sections and found everything to be tooo sweet! The birthdsy cake was FLAT and frankly, I think it is missing baking powder as an ingredient. Furthermore, I found a TYPO in the Gingerbread Cookie recipe on page 169: It said in the directions to ""...add molases, flour, arrowroot powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and ginger..."" AND NO MENTION OF BAKING SODA IN THE INGREDIENT LIST ABOVE! I wasnt sure how much baking soda to add or whether it was supposed to be there in the first place. I added a pinch as a guess and fortunately the cookies turned out OK (with less sugar than called for). Otherwise, it is a good book. Unfortunately, all the meat recipes didnt help me much since I am vegetarian, but Im sure they are just fine."
3,pretty good,"at least this one has some main meal recipes in it.many of the allergy books seem to focus on baked goods.this has some baked goods, but also a few appetizers and some main meals.not a bad book - but i think that some more main meal recipes would make it better."
5,The Best,This cookbook has helped me cook for my milk/egg allergic son for the past 4+years. The chocolate chip cookie and chocolate frosting recipes are wonderful. I've made countless chocolate layer birthday cakes which taste much better than store bought cakes (they are enjoyed by my entire family---even the ones without food allergies). This is a wonderful cookbook. It's a lifesaver.
3,This album is okay,This is an underground release from the Dilated Peoples who had addictive single out called this way that was a big hit even on teenie bopper show 106 and Park so they are started to get some acceptance.But the beats are not the best and I have heard much better and the Lyrics are average on the Rating scale well hereLyrics 7/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 6/10 Classic 8/10 Me 6/10Overall=34/50 This album gets 3.5 Mics
3,Better in the studio,"I love Richard Thompson, but his singing is often out of tune. In the studio, enough care is made that it isn't that bad. But in live recordings I find his intonation grating enough to not want to listen. If you don't have a sensitive sense of pitch, you'll probably appreciate this recording more than I did. If you are new to RT, I suggest one of his studio collections before you get this."
3,Beautiful and educational,"Filled with large and beautiful photographs, this book serves double duty as an attractive coffee table book and an extremely educational guide to the natural forces at work within the stunning Grand Canyon.Author Robert Wallace writes in a clear textbook manner about geological events, wildlife, weather, and native peoples that come to bear on the history of the Grand Canyon.Ironically, without being a guidebook, this could serve as the tourist's best friend in the Canyon by allowing an individual to really unlock the secrets of this popular destination in a way that a traditional guidebook rarely encourages."
4,Good but inaccurate charger.,"The charger works great as far as charging but the digital display could use some modifications too.Not only is the screen hard to see, it also displays inaccurate readings on how charged a battery is.I usually ignore the display altogether and just let the phone or battery charge.The best feature, I really like, is the ability to charge the phone and an extra battery.Leaving an extra battery in the charger seems to be ok.I have yet to have a problem with overcharging.Overall it's a great charger but don't expect to rely on the display."
3,A Mishmosh of a Book,"This book started out as a gripping travel narrative...if only it had stayed that way! Instead of keeping to the flavorful portrait of life in Recife, the author keeps wandering into various sidetracks of Brazilian history, which don't seem to be particularly connected with anything else in the book and are boring to boot. If he'd have stuck to modern Brazil and used its scandals as a backdrop for his travel writing, he'd have had a much more coherent and readable book.Well, that and pore over his style manuals so he understood the difference between italics and quotes. Unaccountably (and annoyingly), passages that should be in quotation marks are set italic. As another reviewer says, it does drive you crazy after a while.This book could've easily seen 4 to 5 stars had it stayed with one theme rather than going all tangential and if somebody working on it had been clued in on their typefaces. I think it merits a rewrite, though, and if it got one it'd be a true treat to read."
4,A Little Known Part of American History,"This book is the definitive work about a little known part of our history -- the Indian Wars of 1865 on the Western Plains. Abraham Lincoln supported a move to draft Confederate prisoners of war languishing (and often starving) in Northern prisons, with the stipulation that they would not have to go South and fight fellow Confederates. The ""Galvanized Yankees"" (so named because it was thought that their loyalty to the North was only a thin ""ganvanized"" layer) -- 6,000 of them, took the oath of loyalty to the Union and headed West to guard stagecoaches and mail routes. Numerous fights with Plains Indians, bitter cold, at lonely outposts were but a few of the hazards the Galvanized Yankees faced. My gg grandfather survived all this and returned home in 1866. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about these brave men who chose service to the Union rather than almost certain death in Northern prisons."
5,Great Mouse!,"The Logitech MX 510 es a great mouse, not only for gaming but for everyday use too, it's very comfortable and the buttons are in the righ place. It's compatible with Mac OS X and with Windows XP and the drivers for the mouse are optional for user who wants to program the extra buttons, a must!Pros:+Comfortable Mouse+Extra Buttons (programables)+Nice Colors+Very good trackin optical laserCons:-No as cheap as similar mouses-Some buttons are not so usefull"
4,quite good overall.,"This stylish mouse is as good as MX 700 except it is not wireless.However, the software does not allow us to self-define the buttons."
3,Stacy Keach as Doc Holliday,"'Doc'Faye Dunaway plays Kate Elder, a prostitute won by Doc Holliday in a card game, in this sort of remake of gunfight at the OK Corral (1957). Doc Holliday is played by Stacy Keach and Harris Yulin is Wyatt Earp. The film picks up the story as notorious gunfighter Doc Holliday arrives in Tombstone, Arizona to help his old mate Earp rid the town of outlaws. Holliday, who is dying of an incurable disease probably figures he has nothing to lose, which is just as well, because the subsequent shoot-out with the Clanton gang resulted in the most famous of all Western legends. It is still a lot of fun with a magnificent score by Jimmy Webb."
2,"""Doc"" -- Starring Stacy Keach and Faye Dunaway","I wasn't impressed by this film. The first hour is slow....way to much dialogue and not enough action.... Come on!-- Let's see the O.K. Corral Shoot-out.....[And when it did come -- it was a disappointment.] The best part of the movie was Faye Dunaway's make-upin the opening scene.......a dirty-face and hot-pink lipstick look - that would make any red-blooded Tombstone male sell his soulfor a chance at the ultimate thrill. When Doc says ""I gotta wash this bitch"" --- you know what he's talking about."
4,quirky cool,"I have no idea what he is singing, but the unpredictable melodies, experimental vocals and jazzy-alt-folk-rock vibe is so very very cool."
5,lovely little pan,"What a fine addition to my slowly-growing collection of Tri-Ply. This one, which I use almost daily, is perfect for boiling a couple of eggs, heating a can of soup, or, best of all, making a perfect Hollandaise from scratch. The practical size and good heft of the pan make no-curdle sauces easy. The trick is to have the ingredients at room temperature, and to gently heat the pan a little before adding them. As with any Tri-Ply pan, remember that this pan conducts heat so efficiently that you'll want to use a much lower heat setting than you're accustomed to. When the sauce is finished, pour it into a serving dish or gravy boat, and put the pan in the sink to soak. Clean-up then requires just a swish with a soapy sponge. My several Tri-Ply pans, like my good knives, make me wonder why I didn't invest in decent stuff years, no, decades earlier."
4,Nice addition,"I love this pot, the look and feel. It is very substantial. The only down side is that my husband dosent like the lid for cooking, it is not a secure fit."
4,Loved but expected different stories,"I really hate to give any ""Chicken Soup"" book less than a 5 star because I am a huge fan.I was slightly disappointed in the content of this book. I really was hoping and expecting that it would have more stories about giving birth. It says on the cover that the 101 stories inspire and warm the hearts of soon-to-be-mothers but I felt like the subjects were too general.For example, the contents are 1. We're Pregnant, 2. Nine Months and Counting, 3 Expectant Fathers, 4. Challenges along the Way, 5. Special Delivery 6. Small Miracle 7. Memorable moments, 8. On Motherhood, 9. Expectant Wisdom.I didn't find many birth stories - in fact, I don't think there was even one.However, in spite of my need for positive birth stories, I still love the stories that they put in the book.Sheri Menelli, childbirth educator, doula, speaker and author of ""[...]"""
1,Horror? oh puleez,This book is the worst horror book i have ever read. The stories are stupid and the feature story is just about a girl using horrible means to [destroy] her boyfriend. This book is sick and the stories are hardly chilling. Not worth a penny.
3,it was good but not great,"When molly starts the whole band her intentions were good I guess a bit childish. Molly is only 17 and yet she acts younger then I do, well that's my opinion. Her friends don't help. Along their journey to stardom they pick up some new band members. One named T whom every one thinks cant talk. And Dean who has to be in charge of everything and wants to be the star. Yet he likes molly. Tara and Jane are her best friends whom she started the band. With Tara has a thing for T. but also has a thing for molly. Jane gets caught up in the party life style and does drugs and gets drunk. One night she takes too much and has to go to the hospital and then molly makes a decision. Which I am not going to tell u. but I will say her and dean fall in love but he is evil and betrays her. Molly's manager got her drunk and made her sign a contract.therefor she is being sued. at times this book got boring going on and on."
2,Not worth the money,"I wish my son liked this swing, but it is a very rare occasion when he'll stay in it longer than five minutes. It is a little difficult to strap him in, too. There are so many better options out there."
2,Does not fit wooden train tracks,I was looking for more trains to fit with my son's Thomas the Train wooden train track set. I read the description and determined this would fit. It doesn't. He's not crazy about playing with it by itself. He just turned 2. I had no idea there were more than a couple of sizes of Thomas the Train trains. This one is smaller than the wooden train track.
4,It's a train,"The only issue with this was the paint color. The picture shows a yellow train and the ID card that comes with it describes the train as ""mustard yellow,"" yet the paint color on the toy was olive green. No big deal, my son doesn't notice, and who knows, this may be a rare exception that someday becomes a collector's edition."
5,Excellent Test book,"This book gives you a different approach to complete your test cycle better. The book is well written, concepts are explained clear and examples are easy to follow. After I red it, I started to apply on my development projects with great results in defining business rules and reducing defects between releases."
4,Cute,"I just got this myself as a Christmas present. I just luv her colours, Crystal Crown is a beautiful pony. The only thing that bothered me was that it took me a bit to figure out the well thing. But her cistume is cute. I`m happier with Crystal Crown`s hair than Petal Blossom`s curly hair. Crystal Crown`s is much easier to brush & deal with."
2,Captain is out of his depth,"An actor writing his own action scenes, stolen from the umpteen thousand shows he's already been in. Snore... The planet Mars a bread basket for Earth. Mars is a dead rock desert so far out that the cost of transportation alone would make a lump of dung more expensive than emeralds. Why doesn't he make the Gobi Desert the bread basket for Earth instead? He sets it in the middle of the 21st century? He might as well have said 31st century, 41st century, anything. He apparently never heard of the Rocket Equation. In summary, this books s**** eggplant bigtime on the score of believability alone. The rest is a poor clone of a TJ Hooker movie of the week."
4,godly art curriculum,"How Great Thou Art incorporates art history and art instruction into a 4-year curriculum for ages 10 and up. Art lessons teach basic fundamentals of drawing, painting, and color theory and include discussions of artists of different time periods. Includes 34 postcard-size reproductions of art, art work cards and tests."
1,OMFG,"This movie is horrible. The acting is some of the worst, the dialogue is laughable. If all you want to see is some flesh get the Story of O, at least it has a plot. And Jack Palance, oh please. If I could give zero stars I would."
1,An absolute disgrace,"Whereas the first book in this series, THE STAR GHOST, was at least readable, semi-likable, and understandable, this book is absolute rubbish. It makes a mockery of Bashir, a mockery of Jake and Nog, a mockery of the Bajorans, a mockery of the whole great show. This is not only a bad book, it is downright insulting. Stay away from this one."
4,Double Click: Romance And Commitment Among Online Couples,"What if you knew your soul mate before you saw them? That's one of the premises Dr. Andrea Baker explores in her new book about meeting and possibly mating via the Internet. Seventy-nine successful and unsuccessful liaisons, some halfway around the world, were reviewed. Does being friends first make for a longer relationship? Does cybersex lead to a commitment? Is hyperhonesty the best policy? It's all in her book - why should I spoil the fun."
3,Not up to snuff,"About 1/3 of this book should have been eliminated by simply taking out the repetitive thoughts of each of the two main characters. I've always appreciate the thoughtfulness of Edith Layton's work, which differentiates it from the standard romance genre, but this one went on way too much on his obsessing over revenge and her ""oh he couldn't possibly want simple little me"". Shorter would be better, but Layton is still above the crowd."
3,poor lighting,"the fan is great,but the light fixture is poorly under powered with 3, 60w bulbs it barely lights up my kitchen,,HATE chandeler lights.need to buy a new light fixture"
3,average read,"It's been many years since my last Norah Roberts book, but unfortunately I was not impressed. The story was entertaining enough, but the characters did not impress me, and neither did the ending of the book. Norah Roberts has written many good books, but this was not one of them."
2,I didn't like it,Very weak story and really boring. I didn't realize ms. Roberts wrote teen-age novels. I wished I hadsaved the money. What a waste of time and money.
5,Bad Boy falls,I love how bad boy turns gentle man and become a true man. I love the whole family and could see it in real life.
3,A good little novel,"This novel is the first one dedicated to de MacKade brothers. It's short, but the love story is very naturaly developed. Neither Rafe nor Regan wanted to fall in love, but they did. The other characters are unforgettable. A very nice contemporary romance by Nora Roberts. A little bit of family love, a little bit of passion, so if you don't have great expectations, it's a very lovely read. What I didn't like is the subplot about the 'haunted' house. The fondness Nora Roberts has for 'the supernatural' is the main reason for me not to read all her books. If I knew, I wouldn't have bought this book. But apart from that, is a good story, very well developed and with nice characters. And she shows how to act against abuse towards women. I like that, too!"
2,Poor Quality Wheels,"I bought these for my dog buggy so I could mount extra wide tires. The rims are 1.375"" (outside dimension) and were able to seat 3"" wide tires, so they gave me what I needed. However these really are cheap and nasty wheels. The bearings grate and wobble, the spokes were all loose, some of the spoke nipples weren't even finger tight. One rim was slightly dented. The tires looked okay, quite smart actually-until I tried taking them off. They were almost impossible to remove. I broke two tire levers getting the first tire off, ended up cutting the second tire off! The wire bead on the tire was massive, thickest I've ever seen. Don't ever have a puncture with the original tires on! Still after tightening up the spokes and replacing the tires the wheels work okay(ish), (but I wouldn't want to use them on a bike)."
1,wack music,"sorry to say this, but you can't make a hit song saying you want a 'night we will remember forever'....and then say in the hook 'im only in town,for one night.' when are latino rappers gonna realize there's more to rap than hoes,money, cars,cruisin,clubbin....etc. records like this add fuel to the rap stereotype that its trash-music."
1,"It's worse than a tv show in terms of acting, and plot.","It's worse than a tv show in terms of acting, and plot. The special effects are good but they were rarely used. The story is boring. Besides, it drags on and on in many scenes. I felt asleep while watching it.It's not worth viewing at all."
2,"Better than the first, but.....","Well, I actually bought this movie from Best Buy just after Christmas, (UN-RATED).Most other reviewers have mentioned everything that I had thought also, however, didn't the dragon remind you of the one from Reign of Fire, same holes in the wings etc?I think the girl mage was actually reading the script as she was acting out her scenes, very flat and not putting much into her role.With a comment to the reviewer who talked about the elf, elves in D & D are alot different from the the ones in Middle Earth, so she might have been trying to cover both and not doing too well at either.The other actors could also have tried a little harder, am not sure if the third should be made unless they get a better budget, better actors, better fx technology, better writers who know a thing or two about the D & D world in general."
2,Trainwreck,"Why can't these people release a GOOD D&D; movie?Having been a fan of the game for over 25 years, I honestly don't know how these hacked together, cliche'd plots even come about.This movie seems to be even worse than the first one - at least the first one had a touch of humor to make it interesting. This one is dour, straightlaced and ploddingly dull as the people quest to make us care about the plot. When I veiwed the film, it truly was like a trainwreck - horrifying that they could make a piece of drivel even WORSE than the first, but I had to finish watching it in the hopes it actually got tolerable at the end. The actors are wooden, dialog stilted, and combat scenes are so-so. Plus, they brought back Damodar - the .... .slowest.... talking... villain... ever! (Let alone the most annoying.)Save your money. Even for D&D; fans, this is a rental B-movie at BEST."
3,Hey Saga...Courtney Solomon was an executive producer,"Ok, I just watched it. It is a far cry better then that other garbage Courtney Solomon made. I hope for more. I know there is a gross (low) budget on this movie but they did it pretty well.maybe one of these days A ""Peter Jackson"" will make a ""Dragonlance series"" (dare to dream)."
5,Much better than the original,"Also saw the screener and was very impressed. This is what the first movie should have been. The choice of film and lighting here is fantastic. The first had a fake look to it. The rogue character is just spot on casting and the rest can't be faulted. Oh, the fighter, Vex, is worth the price of the DVD alone. :)"
3,D&D 2 Electric Boogaloo,"I am reminded of a quote from History of the World Part 1.""Nice. Nice. Not Thrilling, but nice.""This movie has a few ""gaming geek moments"" that fans of D&D; will enjoy. The horrible acting of the first movie is long gone. Replaced by competent acting. Typical Sci-Fi channel quality effects, dialog, directing, editing, etc.All in all a fun romp, on par with Krull and Hawk the Slayer, just a notch down from The Princess Bride and Ladyhawke. Leaps and bounds above Phantom Menace."
3,Much better than the first!!!,"If you play or have played the game, you'll appreciate some of this flick. If they had the budget they did from the first movie this could have been much better. Overall it's not bad for movies of this genre - worth getting."
4,Good stuff!,"Adapted from the Role-Playing game Dungeons & Dragons comes Wrath of the Dragon God...nice title and reflects the contents of the movie very well. This particular D&D; movie begins setting up a romance throwing it into conflict with the forming of a raiding party to eliminate the source of evil brewing in the land. The antagonist, Damodar, breathes an evil darkness into this movie rounding out the usually love and adventure fantasy movie. All the characters played their classes well and were never dull to watch. The dragon encounters are quite awesome and wonderful to behold on the screen as well.If you like wizards, spells, and dark magic this volume has loads of it and many references to lore and wizardry. I must say I enjoy this one more and more I watch it...seen it five times now! Worth the money and you can find used copies at decent prices still...enjoy!"
3,Insulting to all New Yorkers,"As a born and bred Brooklynite I found Stiles' tone used to describe Brooklyn and that accent a little insulting. Don't let that stop you from checking out this book, though. Well written and very entertaining. I even give the author credit for doing the right thing in the end, leaving."
2,A boring premise and story make for an unengaging read.,"The author freely admits he's after money, period, which is why he joined Merrill Lynch, which should tell us something about his motivation for writing this book. Unfortunately for him, the boring stories and flat characterizations make this book dull. Have our attention spans gotten so short that ""tell alls"" books can only cover a year's worth of time? Lord save us from 20-somethings who think what they've experienced so far is so meaninful they must write a book, and save us from our keyword-oriented society (""Has to do with the market? Let's publish it!"") that keeps this kind of stuff coming off of printing presses."
2,"A self serving, boring autobiography","If you want to read about how to fail on Wall Street, this is the book for you. The feeling is that Stiles would like to provide a muckraking image of Wall Street greed, but his work comes over as the work of a complainer. Stiles is obviously, and by his own account, not suited for and does not have the aptitude for a career on Wall Street. The reader is dragged through this pain for 323 pages. It would have been more fun to read about someone who was successful, but left The Street due to some moral/soul searching reason. A Wall Street junkie may find parts of the book interesting. Buy this in paperback or used."
5,An accurate potrayal of Life on the Street,"Having worked as an analyst in investment banking, I can sympathize with Paul Stiles' experience. The ""sink or swim"" mentality is pervasive in the industry due to the manic pace of the Market which either toughens your exterior or rapidly brings about disillusionment. Mr. Stiles descriptively and compassionately recounts a telling tale, one that has been repeated by many liberal arts majors who have compromised their true interests and happiness for the lure of the almighty dollar on Wall Street. For those ""hungry"" college and business school graduates in search of wealth and success, let Mr. Stiles' message be a lesson in cost-benefit analysis."
5,A lot of these reviewers are missing the point,"Here's a book by a talented guy who goes to Wall Street and decides that there is a lot more to life than just making money, for reasons a lot of people would agree with. Why do so many people find that threatening? Three cheers for someone with the guts to tell it like it is. We all need to hear it."
2,"Part encouraging, part nauseating.","If you are reading this book to get an inside look at Wall Street, don't. It is much more a tale of one man's life than a description of life at Mother Merrill. Encouraging and invigorating at the outset, the book dulls if you are expecting a ""Liar's Poker"" style tale. One must give Stiles credit, he does write a good tale. However, his blame is misplaced. I have loaned my copy to friends in the industry and all were somewhat disappointed. If you haven't read the staples of the genre, save this one til later."
5,Outstanding scientific rock!,"I found this DVD to be not only hilarious but also quite hard-rocking. The comedy on this disc may well revolutionize science itself. The C.O.G. are quite possible the maddest scientists in the history of rock music and I salute them. In fact, I would raise a glass to these demented geniuses, but as I cannot currently move my arms, that toast will have to wait for the completion of my supra-robotic-exo-skeleton early next year. Bravo!-Dr. Stephen Hawking"
2,Thick and thin on a whim,"This review is for non-techies flirting with getting deeper into the tech side. Despite the low rating, the book is worth purchasing. Be prepared for spots of derailing detail that will likely throw the casual reader off track. Other areas are too thin, probably due to the author's assumptions that the reader is already up to speed. The kiss of death for this book is the spelling and grammar. I used this book in a summer capstone course in FSU's interactive communication master's program. My students were the first to point out the book would have been handed back ungraded for a rewrite. Is there an editor in the house? The publisher blew this one; don't blame the author."
4,Solid,"Works just fine. I wouldn't expect it to be terrible. I wouldn't say I can tell the difference between good RAM and bad RAM but, it works. So that's good."
2,What went wrong?,"What makes a gripping story? I honestly find it hard to pin down...I remember reading some of the battle scenes in Steven Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"", and actually leaping out of my bed to pace until my heart stopped racing. I was hoping that ""Men of Bronze"" would provide a similar experience, but I'm disappointed.I can't sympathize with any of the characters; the battle scenes are cookie cutter; the descriptions of the surroundings and characters, somehow lacking. I found myself reading with a vague detachment, as if eating a bag of Doritos when I'm really not hungry. And I like Lays better than Doritos.So, mildly dissatisfied, I'm putting the book down before I finish it. I don't want to say that it's a bad book...it just didn't awaken my appetite for more."
2,Gave me a stomacheache,"This was a light and fluffy read with lots of nostalgia. Everyone can remember their favorite childhood candy and the author just about covers them all.Aside from the novelty of a biography centered around candy, I can't say this was a particularly interesting read. The author's life was dull and although she writes well, there's not much that can make up for a boring story.Reading this book gave me a stomachache. Unless you have a serious (and I do mean serious) love of candy, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,The Ultimate Fountain Pen,"This pen is a beautiful instrument to behold. My collection consists of some pens that are more expensive and some that are less expensive, but this one is by far my favorite to use due to its superb craftsmanship, balance and design. The ink always flows evenly from the solid gold nib and writing with it is a joy. You simply will not find a better pen than this Cross Townsend fountain pen at any price."
3,Poor Built-in Storage Feature,"I had a Lite Brite as a girl and was thrilled my daughter received one for Christmas. She's turning 4 in a few weeks. Unfortunately the built-in storage feature is horrible. Once you roll it shut, it's almost impossible to open. However with a lot of force and effort, it'll eventually open, but then you inevitably toss out all the pegs from the container spilling them everywhere. I guess I'll just put the pegs in a separate container. I also think the light could be a bit brighter. Last, it should come with more pegs. All in all my daughter is enjoying it and I think it's great for fine motor skills. Still I wouldn't recommend this particular Lite Brite. The design is poor."
1,"Please, do not purchase this!","I would highly recommend not purchasing this product. The compartment where you store the light pegs is very difficult to open even for an adult. When you finally get it open, the pegs go everywhere and you spend a good five minutes picking them up off the floor. The flat screen falls over. You have to lay it down to actually do anything. It is battery operated not like the older model which plugs in. It only comes with a few designs for the pegs as well. If you want to buy this toy, I would highly recommend going on Ebay and buying the older version. It is much better. I give this product one star. Thankfully, we didn't waste our money on it. It was a birthday gift for our daughter. DON'T BUY!"
1,Great Toy But Can't Get Past The Toxic Plastic PVC Smell!,"I am amazed that nobody else has noticed the smell...am I the only one? I noticed it the first time my daughter played with it and weeks later, after being aired out, it still has that awful, PVC smell that we have been warned about. It's not the pegs but the unit itself and it is STRONG. I am going to get rid of this and find an older model on ebay that I feel is more safe for her to handle.Also, as some of the other reviewers mentioned, the storage drawer is a great idea if it didn't stick so badly and the pegs seem to fall out very easy.I'm glad I only paid about $[...] for it on sale. It won't hurt so bad when I throw it out. I'm disappointed in Hasbro though, for sure."
4,peg holder gets stuck,"I agree with previous reviews that the peg holder gets stuck. It's a good idea in concept, but when you have to push hard to get the holder open, the pegs end up flying everywhere when it suddenly lets go. The timer on the light could be a little longer, also, but I don't consider that a problem to just push the button again. Also, I found that the orange and pink pegs were hard to tell apart.Overall, I think it's a great toy and would buy it again - I just wish they would improve the peg holder."
2,Disappointed,"Growing up with Lite Brite, I was very excited to see it available for my kids. I bought 2 - for less than 10$ each. The first one doesn't turn on, the second one won't shut off. Will be calling to see what Hasbro will do. They were not easy to find so I am not very optimistic that this will have a happy ending."
4,Book Review,"I loved Fat Kid Rules The World. It was the kind of book where I wanted to find out what happened, but I didn't want the book to end. Sure, there was swearing. Sure, there was refrences to things I probably shouldn't talk about, but they all were emphasis to Troy's world. Going does, indeed, have a colorful way with words in many respects. I would recomend this book to anyone, especially musicians."
3,checkers,wow! this book is very interesting. For me I only stayed hooked to this book was because I wanted to see what happens bad next to zinkoff. I personaly dont like this book because I have friends that have disabilitys and there nothing like zinkoff so it was hard to read and like this book. But if your into suspence i think you will like this book. you also have to keep in mind hes not the brightess kid. I would recommend you to try to read this book. 3 stars.
4,My wife loves this product,"Bought a litter locker just over a year ago, and my wife raves about how simple it is to use and maintain. Refills still cost a bit more than they probably should based on my knowledge of the manufacturing process and perceived value vs received value, but the prices are starting to come down. Overall, we highly reccommend this product."
5,5 PACK LITTER LOCKER REVIEW,Was pleased with the fast service. Have used this product before and was always happy with it.
5,Great price and service,Always received items in time and best price I can find. Will do business with this company again. Highly recommended.
4,litter locker refills,"one of the refills wasn't packaged right , so it did not work. i could not use it.not to happy about that."
3,Nice pot but disappointing attention to little details,"The pot is generally well made but there are 2 major flaws with the design which would prevent me from buying this again. The first is that the lid design does not allow condensation/steam to escape or return to the pot cleanly - it splutters and spits out all over the pot and stove. The second problem is only if you use the steamer insert. the wire handles on the steamer basket are too short - they are too short to lay out of the way on the sides/edge of the basket, and they are so short that they just lay on the foods in the middle of the basket or dangle down the center. They just plain get in the way of everything - they need to be made longer so that they can lay on the rim of the basket when not being used."
1,Big Disappointment!,"I bought this pot to replace a similar pot thatI loved and had used frequently until the handle broke off. I have been very dissapointed in this purchase. I don't even use the glass lid for the sputtering/splashing reasons cited by many other users. I use the lid from my old pot. In addition, the handles on the small basket are ridiculous, as they fall down into the food you are steaming instead of staying sensibly over at the top sides of the insert. The large basket is poorly designed to be raised too far above the liquid in the bottom of the pot, making the basket too short... All in all... a completely frustrating experience. I'm looking for another pot, probably not Calphalon."
5,"A definate ""Must have""","If you are looking for an addition to your already well stocked kitchen, YOU NEED this one. It is a Pasta cooker, with strainer, or it is a steamer for either a little or a lot of vegies. You can make stock with the strainer in it, and voila, just pull the strainer out, and your stock is ready.Frankly, I have yet to purchase a bad stainless steel item from Calphalon. Thank you Amazon for carring them!"
2,Slow Boiler,"This pot takes forever to boil compared to our other Calphalon stainless pots and you really don't have the option of putting less water in to compensate. Once it reaches boiling temperature, the lid does tend to spit quite a bit. If you have a ceramic top stove, stay away from this one."
2,Not what you think,"I saw a Calphalon multi-pot set at Williams & Sonoma and thought I was ordering the same one. Turns out this is made in China and not the US. Having seen this, I now realize that Calphalon has different quality/grade lines. The inferior quality in construction and design is readily apparent. For example, the steamer uses two wire handles instead of one which makes getting things in and out of the steamer more difficult. Moreover, the price was not significantly different than the higher model. If I had known or seen this particular beforehand, I would not have purchased it."
2,Rather dumb,"There is some sort of moral tale at the heart here about a weird, but happy, family living absurdly close to the end of a rural highway in France. Suddenly, the road is extended and reopened, and the family is surrounded by a mounting number of noisy speeding vehicles. The commentary is about man's destruction of natural beauty and quiet, I suppose. The radio reports of the freeway's opening are funny as the announcer absurdly extols the virtues of the new highway. The teenage daughter appears to do nothing but lay around and suntan all day while listening to heavy metal music. What the father does for a living is hard to say. The mother seems to be a bit bonkers and cannot bear the idea of ever leaving their rather squalid house, filled with dirty clutter. I half expected someone to get run over by a speeding car any minute. You won't come away with much from this little film."
5,We can do this!,"This is a helpful book! It was comforting to both my husband and me as we talked about certain chapters to know we are not alone dealing with this. We'd say, ""See, we're not the only ones"", or ""Oh, we hadn't even thought about that yet"". It is a very informative and practical resource and we've referenced it more than once to deal with new situations- so plan to keep it on a handy bookshelf! This book helps put things into perspective and helps us focus on the positive things we can do to manage food allergies."
5,Dramatic,It fits perfectly in our kitchen and matches cabinets. Very well made and beautiful fixture. It arrived on time and installation was not difficult.
5,SARD,this is a very good book to get you started on the road to training your dog to be a Search and Rescue dog
1,Not bad If you already know how to knit,"This book is very confusing and I don't recommend it unless you have a buddy there with you who already knows how to knit. There are multiple directions for one drawing and it is unclear, since it is not clearly shown, how one should exactly proceed. Using this book is similar to learning how to knit with only verbal instructions. Though the book is cheap, the beginner knitter is probably better off spending his/her ten dollars on another book with more, clearer drawings. Otherwise it is just as well to get knitting instructions free online since they are equally as obscure as this book. Likewise, there are too many baby projects here. While making tiny sweaters over and over again might be useful for someone with children or grandchildren, if you are looking to make something for yourself, this book is limited in terms of projects."
3,Minor complaints,"I think the quality of this shelf is great. Nice details. It is very heavy, so you have to be careful how you hang it. Two minor things -- the corner paint was nicked on the shelf and I was shorted two of the small snaps on the L bracket to cover the screw holes. Since it was ordered online, I don't feel like returning it through the mail, and I noticed these things after it was almost all put together. (Babyrus does not accept online purchases in stores for some reason.) However, I have written the company (WB) and will update this review if my concerns were addressed."
3,Maybe not a museum piece...,"This lamp works well for our piano, and hasn't caused any fires. Is that a good review? It is functional and attractive for it's price.The only reservations I have are:1) The knobs are a bit cheaply made and hard to tighten and2) The switch is bit far down the cord. If the switch was on the base or the head we wouldn't have to reach down behind the piano to turn it on and off.Considering the price, not a bad lamp.Added 2009/11: Considering the *current* price, I wouldn't touch it."
3,Abrahams gets kids.,"As I read this book, I kept waiting for all of Ingrid's cheekiness and audacity to catch up with her. She breaks the law a handful of times, puts her life in danger a handful of times, and learns that things work out in the end.While this is probably not what we want our children to learn, this is a work of fiction, and it is quite well written. I love the way Abrahams illustrates Ingrid's thought process as she lies, sneaks, and shrugs off homework (gasp!!). Ingrid's a smart cookie, and her instincts take her through many adventures.Naturally, kids don't want to read that their heroine breaks all the rules, saves the day, but still gets in trouble. Once the hero saves the day, all sins are forgiven, right? Maybe not in reality, but in the world of children's fiction we know that anything is possible."
3,Down the Rabbit Hole,"I chose to give this book a three out of five starts just because, it had a good story line and gave great descriptions of characters. You could never get lost in who-was-who. I liked how the author brought everything together in the end; however, some parts of the book could have been left out. I did not like how it lack suspense. Only here-and-there did it draw me in to want to read more. I recommend middle school students to read this book because, it has young characters and is an easy read."
1,Too hard to believe the protoganist is a 13 yr old.,"Parents beware, this book details a 13 yr old who commits many crimes, lies to her parents, cuts school, lies to the police, recklessly endangers herself many times, and has few qualms regarding any of her behavior. And in fact, no negative consequences.Listened to the audio version with my 13 yr old daughter, she agreed that it was unrealistic."
4,Sister Princess,Sister Princess is a charming anime. It has great interpersonnal interactions. The characters are believable without going over-board.The cons of Sister Princess are that it is nothing really excptional. The plot and story are not particualarly orginal.In my opinion it is worth the money since the thin-pack is priced well and it is a good anime.
1,Not what I expected...,I bought this keychain thinking it would be a cute little gift for my boyfriend who is in love with Toy Story. I bought him one before from the Disney store and it ended breaking by the chain. Then I saw this one and thought this was better quality and might last longer. Boy was I wrong. He dropped his keys by accident and next thing we know the keychain completely falls apart. It was replaceable but it ended up breaking within 2 weeks.
3,Book Review,There was a kid named Andrew and his parents were going out of town for a buisness trip in Europe. Andrew was going to sleep in this kids old room and the kid is now dead. Andrew was getting scared he was hearing noises in the attic and so he went up there to see who was there and no one was there he found a thing of marbles and he took them and then he went to sleep he had this dream that Drew was now a ghost and he was going to kill him for taking his marbles. So Andrew got really scared so he put the marbles back. Then Andrew found out that he had died of fever so they switched lives so that Drew could get rid of the fever with the newer doctors and machines. SO then he got rid of the fever. Sothen Andrew wanted his own life back and Drew said that he would switch lives again if he beat him at a game in marbles. And Andrew didnt beat him. BUt finally he ended up beating him. I thought that it was an okay book it would of been better if it was a lot scarer.
2,Too dramatic,"Well-written, but far too dramatic for me. It has a happy ending, but it's a sad & painful ride getting there & when I say ending, I do mean the very end.People who love drama and tear-jerkers will love it, but those who read for a world of happy fantasy with just a touch of drama thrown in to keep you turning the page will hate it. I actually found myself skipping to the end to make sure things would be somewhat ok before I could finish it & I never do that.It's a good book, just not a book for me. A little more romance & a little less drama please."
4,Hot Read,I have read all of Radclyffes books and this was one of the good ones. Its filled with loads of intriguing characters and you will end up falling in love with half of them. The romance betweeen Hays and Auden although slow to get going is just as intense as every other romance Radclffe has written. I wonder if anyone else noticed that when Auden puts herself and Hays in to a scene from one of Rune Dryes books (location 3275) the scene is actually from Radclyffes Shadowland. Another great book from Radclyffe.
4,great bite on rotor but they are DUSTING A LOT and are not too quiet,"had those brake pads on '00 Toyota Solara front rotors (OEM resurfaced) and I have to admit, the stopping power is awesome!however those pads after 1 month of use started dusting like crazy and the color of that dust is ugly rusty brownish, so be prepared to wash the wheels at least once a month with daily driving.another problem is that those pads squeak a little bit until they warm up, especially when you hold the car down on brakes and release brakes to start moving. occasionally I can hear a faint squeak when coming to a full stop (again with cold pads).considered the price, I'm not sure I would buy them again, maybe if they were cheaper. Akebono makes similar strong pads (Street Performance model) that has only slightly less grip on rotor, but those are dead silent and low dusting truly.other than that, they are life savers if you need your car to stop on a dime! :)"
3,Chocked Full O Wisdom and Guidance,"Great book! This book has lots of helpful information for anyone adopting. The reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because of the sections where you can use it to record your own journey. I found some of the language kind of cheesy and narrow. Not all adopting people are married and adopting infants. The cover has a picture of a cute Asian baby, but again, very limiting in scope. I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to gain info and support, but would recommend they might keep looking to find a book to put in the family's hopechest."
1,Boring Brits,"If watching seven british men whine about their love lives is your idea of entertaining, then by all means check out this video. Otherwise, stand clear. The dialogue is tedious, the characters are contrived and their motivation is absolutely forced. All you can hope is that the killer from ""Cruising"" might pop up and finish them all off. Not funny, not romantic, and not worth one's time."
2,right from the start: taking charge in a new leadership role,"I was very disappointed with the digital version of this book. It was little more than what is usually available for free browsing. I could not believe that I had paid $4.95 for 9 pages. In the future, I'll be much more careful when I purchase an edocument or book."
5,Cute Toy!,"I bought this for my little sister for christmas. She's been asking for one for a long time! It's soft and plush, and comes with it's own membership I.D for the website. I even check out the website, so if you are worried about your little one being on the internet with this toy, i guarantee nothing bad will happen. The website has a specific dictionary of words that your child can ONLY use to talk with. You can't use any numbers, and any words that show up in the text that aren't part of the dictionary show up in red, and the message will not be sent. It's a fun little interactive game, and really helps kids to use their imagination! Its cheap too!Five star!! I highly recommend it!"
3,Very Soft but several defects,"The toy is very soft, and overall looks good. However, when I first got it, some chunks of the mane and tail were coming out. There is still enough fur to make the mane and tail look good. The rear right leg is also substantially longer than the rear left leg. This may be for pose-ability, though it makes the unicorn look weird in a standing upright position."
1,Did not deliver this light.,"I ordered a pair of these lights, and these are fantastic lights, but this is not what was delivered. What came was a pair of Coast PX45 lights. These are also great lights but not what I wanted or I would have ordered them. I wanted a single simple on off, incredibly bright, and long battery life. The PX45 has a high low feature and is too bulky to fit in my shotgun mount.On the bright side, Pearl at BIC Warehouse did offer to reduce the price on the lights that were substituted but I did not want the PX45. I expected a full refund and was given one, and shipping was covered.BIC Warehouse is a credible business and gave me good customer service. Though I didn't appreciate automatic substitution I did appreciate the communication and efforts of their representative Pearl."
4,Naughty Fun,"People say that Orton is similar to Wilde, but I think he can better be described as a funnier version of Harold Pinter. I enjoyed this play, though I'm not sure I'll read Orton's other work."
1,Just Horrible.,There is a reason this show died. Save yourself the misery. Even die hard fans have to admit it. Blow.
3,I bought it just to see what I missed,"Unlike some reviewers I didn't think Heroes was a great series- it was at it's best in the first season. I think the producers are supposed to have admitted once they had no real story plan but were making it up as they went along- I think the writing showed it as time went on.By the time 3rd season was well along I'd gotten tired of seeing how many character roles Ali Larter was stuck with (they even seemed to ignore her entirely part of the season), Hayden Panettierre?- couldn't the writers find something to do with ""Claire"" besides kill/injure her?Amazon had it really cheap when I made my order, so I decided to catch up on the episodes I hadn't bothered with while the series was still running. However good or bad it'll be at least it will look goog and maybe the extras will be good too."
3,not bad,"This book is an example how to make money on books like this.Allen's multiple stream of income is selling books.The good thing about this book is that it show you how to think to be succesfull.But you got to be good self-marketer and very talented salesman to use this advices sucessfully.This book is very similar to Kiyosaki's ""Rich dad,poor dad"",wchich can change the way you think,but will not help you make fortune in a month.As a citizen of European Union, i respect the leverage of global publishing market,just like Allen uses.There will be always somebody naive around the world to buy such a book or his seminar,just to fell better,or to fell like millionaire.Those people are enough for buying new Ferrari.So,let's be naive and buy this book.Just to fell better."
1,There is something rotten un Utah,"Robert allen's book inspired me and all, at least until I started doing a little homework and a background check. It seems Mr. Allen has filed for bankruptcy twice and a member of his Atlanta real estate club was sent to jail for trying his nothing down techniques. Although some of his chapters are good, such as covered calls and mutual funds/stocks, it is nothing you can't get from 15 minutes on the internet. He also keeps shamelessly plugging away for his website, coopers covered calls, and his conferences/phone calls, etc... It is bogus, go read one up on wall street or buffettology to really make some money"
1,Check Out the Gurus Before You Buy,"http://www.johntreed.com/Reedgururating.htmlScroll down until you see the name ""Robert G. Allen."" click on his name and read the sad truth about this guy.If you're still interested in alternative streams of income, go to Google and search for PASSIVE INCOME OPPORTUNITIES."

AllenNew York Times #1 Best Seller:""Time and time again, I'm referred to as 'America's #1 Millionaire Maker'... that means one thing:I take ordinary people (some of them right out of the unemployment line and some right out of Regis Philbin's studio audience) and show them exactly what to do to create six-figure incomes - andTHEN THEY DO IT!""I can show you how to do the same...

1,Yes tehre is people making money of this book,"And guess who that is?The people who write it!This is once more one of these books living of people who think you could make a fortune without any sweat... just like the work-out machines that claim to give you a sizpack without any work-out...of course there might be some smart tips in books like these, but the bottom line is that robert g allen is the guy who makes most the money thanks to this book.and i am here because of spam i have recieved so no thanks to this author..."
2,Be prepared to spend a lot of money if you buy this book,"This book is really the first step in a series up ""up-sells"" that Allen and his organization will attempt. There is some good stuff but you won't find enough of it in the book to actually accomplish anything. That's on purpose. They want you to feel compelled to purchase some more material...and on and on it goes until you're a few THOUSAND dollars into the ""system."" Even then it's small small percentage who find any kind of success."
1,An advertisment in book form.,"If you really want the detailed ""how to"" information that is baited in this book you need to go to Robert Allen's web site, which is referenced throughtout the book. And what do you see when you get there? Seminars and other publications that cost serious money to actually learn to do what he is preaching. While the basic premise of the book is correct, don't be fooled to think you'll be able to take specific action, except for buying more of his material."
4,A True Inspiration!,Robert G. Allen is a true inspiration! The man is a financial genius and he incorporates his ideas on his success by referring to his web sites and other books. This man has inspired me to try new avenues to change my financial way of thinking! I recommend this book to anyone looking for information to increase the potential of their financial future. After reading this book I am looking forward to reading both Nothing Down and Creating Wealth. Now it's time to put his ideas in motion for myself.
1,"Bunk, Ripoff, Used Car Salesman Save your money","This is the kind of swindle you see on TV at 3AM. Save your money, this guy makes used car salespersons look good.Any positive reviews here are from his associates or friends IMHO."
2,poorly described,"I bought this wine rack for my wife to install in the liquor cabinet . . . i thought I'd buy it, hang it and fill it with wine . . .when the rack arrived it was simply a row of six loops . . .great for one end of the bottles, but what of the other end . . it seems you need to buy two . . .or in my case i made a wooden bracket with six one inch holes to hold the neck ends of the bottles . . .the verdict: Not what I thought I was getting"
3,Poor writing style,I had a hard time following the topics. It could use some editing from a qualified editor or book reviewer.
4,Future Archeologist,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew, and he was SO excited when he received it. We don't live in the same state, but he called and said that he was so excited to go on a ""dig"" first thing in the morning! It's nice to find educational toys and activities to inspire young minds and imaginations."
5,For SOS purists,"No new or ""live"" material here, but it's great to see the stars lip-sinc their hits. Very entertaining for SOS die-hards . . . I liked it!"
2,Nice product but NO support or help,"I purchsed the product and one should be able to load the software and have the unit discovered automatically. It would not auto detect on my network. When I checked help I was told the help files are not compatable with the language installed on my PC. So I went to my Win98 machine and had the same problem. I spent 30 minutes on hold with technical support before I gave up. They had NO help on ther web site and when I tried to contact support via e-mail I receved two automatic responses, saying go to the web site, but again no help or drivers for this new model. Through trial and error I did add manually and I got it working but, from my experience I will not buy another D-Link product. Cisco is to have a unit out in a matter of weeks and they do have a good support structure."
4,good for the price,Had some problems in the beginning but after a little tinkering all was well. Every so often I have to reboot it and my router to make it work. But for the price I guess it will do.
3,Ok but not as good as the competition,"I'm very happy with the D-Link DWL-1000 Access Point, however they have not done too well with this USB adapter. The range is much less than competing PCI or PC Card adapters from Lucent or Cisco and the software is rather lacking. If it wasn't for the fact that I NEED a USB adapter for my application, I would have returned this item a long time ago (having the antenna away from the back of the PC is quite important). By far the most annoying problem is an apparent bug that causes the speed to degrade over time from 3Mbps down to 1Mbps until the PC is rebooted. I don't know if this is an isolated problem, but D-Link has yet to respond to my technical support queries.Overall this is a decent choice for the average home user who doesn't want to deal with opening up the computer. Anyone planning on professional use should opt for one of the Cisco or Lucent cards with an external antenna."
2,Don't waste your time,"Product seems to be OK but if you run into any trouble forget about it. D-link tech support is clueless. They can't speak English, and they have no knowledge of their own products much less basic networking. I bought a D-Link 713P (wireless router)along with this product. Tech support could not even tell me what one of the two products was at fault. I'm returning both items and I'm getting a Linksys router and NIC. You get what you pay for, and I recommend you pay a little extra for another wireless brand."
4,Self Discovery,"This book was awesome. It reflects the hardships a person goes through when they are faced with themselves. The author has captured the essence of what it feels like to be alone, and dealing with self discovery."
1,Nothing to pay money for,I am pretty disappointed with this seat all the way round. I have installed many things and assembled too many to count. This seat by FAR was the biggest pain in the bottom I have ever come across. I'm sure it's great for a bike that is spot on perfect to the one they built this for. Sway from that in the slightest and beware : /The padding is thin and offers little comfort. The height they list on the box is also misleading. My daughter qualified under the numbers but her feet could go past the safety cover they offer.It may be an extreme response but I hated this seat so much I'm not even going to try another. I'm going straight to a trailer. Hauling a RV would be less stressful to me than another seat like this .
3,Spend the extra $25 and get the Bell Cacoon... I wish I did,"This seat is good but if you are average height or shorter you ride a smaller bike. My bike is just big enough for the seat and it sits really low. The bar on the seat hits my lower back. The ""leg protector"" is also very cheap and I now wish I would have spent the extra money to get the other one because it looks safer as far as leg protection."
2,Makes Godzilla's Revenge look like fine Cinema,"If you love giant monster movies this is probably not for you.The acting is so bad it's painful to watch, I'm suprised the actorscould keep a straight face during the goings on.When I saw this I was hoping for a remake along the lines of whatwas done with the Gamera franchise but no such luck."
2,Bottom of the Barrel Entertainment for the Perverse,"What can I say? ""Wiseguys..."" is unbelievably crappy, but the lead does enough funny gangster schtick to make it amusing for most of it's duration. Story, acting, makeup, gore, photography and direction, all suck beyond anything you're likely to have seen before.As I recall,""...Satan's Icebox"" is torture porn, without enough sex or gore to be anything more than a tease, without any satisfying payoff. Like ""Wiseguys..."", if you've never made a movie before, or even though of making one, you could hardly do worse.That being said, these 2 films have their charm, for those who enjoy this kind of crap. If you don't already know you're one of those sick-os, view at your own risk!"
1,Poor customer support,I purchased the product and and have repeatedly tried to contact the tech support line listed in the liturature by phone and e-mail with no response. I am very disapointed and the productr is unusable. What a ripoff.
3,What's with the bottle?,"This item, from how it is described and how it works, is great. I dont have the greatest car in the world right now but I cant stand scrubbing going through the process of getting the oxidation off of my headlights. We do a lot of driving in Vermont and New Hampshire and at night we need bright lights. So far so good, and I hope the product lasts and keeps maintenence low.THE PROBLEM with this product is the bottle it comes in. It leaks, even when in the locked position, and the bottle itself is very flimsy. It's almost like these 'eco-bottles' that bottled water comes in now. For a relatively expensive product, and one that should last a couple years, I'm very concerned with how this will store and operate down the road. To me, its like going to a 4 star restaurant and having my meal come out on a paper plate. It doesnt make sense, and the quality does not refect the price."
3,Time of the Gypsies - Finally available on DVD,"I've searched for a DVD of this film for years, but the only versions available were VHS tapes, and DVDs not formatted for US players. Finally, this version released in S. Korea is formatted for all regions. Unfortunately, the visual quality is less than ideal, and the English subtitles appear to have been dashed off by a non-English speaker - misspellings, odd word choices, and the pronoun ""I"" is hit and miss capitalized and then not - often within a single sentence. The story, characters and images remain compelling, but the poor production of this release is distracting and disappointing."
3,Punky Semi-Permanent Colour Cream Plum,"It's alright, but not great. It did not leave my hair smooth, considering I had to spend a good 35-45 minutes in the shower doing various rinse outs with shampoo. I then used a conditioner which I left in for a while, merely because my hair felt like hay. I did not bleach it, as I wanted to only get a tint in the sun."
5,Gorgeous Green Goodness!,"I first stumbled across this brand about four years ago when I was looking to dye my bleached undercut. I was searching for a nice vibrant green and found exactly what I wanted, the grassy green hue of the dye making my undercut pop against the contrast of my black A-line bob. It was very easy to apply and care for, only needing a retouching and lifting of the roots about once a month to maintain the beautiful hue.Consistency makes it efficient to apply by either comb or brush. Can be left on for hours and leaves hair well conditioned and soft. The color will bleed a bit for the first few days, but otherwise it holds well. And, for it's price, it lasts for a pretty good amount of time."
5,Great,"Smells good (raspberry?), stays the right color red for a long time and then fades to a lighter shade but never totally washes out. Exactly what I wanted."
2,not what i expected...in a bad way,"dont apply this product to blonde or light hair expecting it to be ""semi permanent""... its not, so i guess if you want the colour to last then its great. its also not violet, its more of a very dark almost black ink blue. it has a strange chemical grape fragrance too."
2,Stan and Ollie Not At Their Best.,"Im a big Stan and Ollie fan.This film sadly,I wish had never been made.Thelma Todd was cast at first as the gypsy queen but died while this film was being made,so,alas,shes only got a small part.The boys are gypsies who get into all kinds of problems.The original script(Sample,Stan gets drunk and turns the scene into a laugh riot)was not used.Sadly,Hal Roach used the alternate script which is nowheres as good.I saw it years ago and was disappointed."
3,Fun!,My daughter is 4 years old and she loves it. I am always finding the hopscotch in the middle of my kitchen. Although it is cute and she loves it the heart shape markers don't stay on the mat when you toss them. It is difficult to get the markers to land on the mat.
4,Get the wiggles out,"This set is great for getting the wiggles out when it is too wet or cold to play outside. It stores easily and compactly when not inuse. My 3 year old struggles a bit to put the pieces all together by herself, but she loves the princesses. It is helping her to learn how to play hopscotch and to take turns."
4,Only pictures ~ no written directiions But ~,"Really cute and made well... one item missing from package that was needed to puttogether properly,,, not good directions... pictures only but in the end.. well worth it. Took approx. 1 hr. to put together ."
5,Great doll bed!,"I like this doll bed alot, it is very sturdy and veryeasy to put together. I love playing with it and it fits american girl dollsvery well! THE ONLY THING IS IT IS CHEAPER AT [...] SO DON""TBUY IT FROM HERE! IT IS $[...] @ [...]!"
5,Very cute bed.,Bought for xmas gift to go with American Girl Doll. Dolls fit and granddaughter was very excited about having a place for her dolls. Very cute.
3,A little complicated,This is not a beginner book on the craft. It is for very advanced witches. But I have been studying for two years and I am not sure Iwas ready for this book. The stuff in it require a witch more advanced than most.
5,"Batman - The Animated Series, Volumes 1-4","This DVD collection is a must have for anyone who grew up during the 90's watching Warner Brothers 1992 Animated Series, Batman.It's even better if you didn't grown up."
5,Great gift,"I grew up watching this animated show with my brother after school when we were kids. I gave this to him for Christmas, and he loved it!"
5,Incredible story. Based on true events. Very well written. Spellbinding,"Ive read this book 2-3 times now. I always find something new that is important to my life now. This book needs to be read by everyone that has read The Way Of The Peaceful Warrior. It gives much needed background and if possible needs to be read first. The importance of breathing, being in the here and now, present to every moment of every day with everyone that you are with."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic book.This Book is amazing, I wanted to know more about Socrates after watching the film ""The Way of the Peaceful Warrior""The Journeys of Socrates: An Adventure.I could not put this book down, it is truly magical., Thank you Dan Millman.When is the film coming out?"
5,Another amazing story from Dan Millman,"It's not the same as his other books...the metaphysical lessons are much more subtle and sewn in through a story line, but at the end you understand why he had to write the book and you are glad he did."
3,Amazing,We have lost all resilience when we compare Socrate's life with how some of us live! I have read the book twice now. This last time for the spiritual book group that I run. The book illustrates that we as humans need a long time to bring about the changes within ourselves that many of us so desire. We have to dig deep within ourselves and be prepared to face all our demons in order to achieve the change we wish to see within ourselves.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
5,Excellent introduction for the layperson,"The author lucidly explains the basics of glaciers and glaciation, and the book can serve as a branching-off point for further study, or as a terminus for a layperson wishing to expand his knowledge of glaciers and glacial landscapes. As a lay-level book, I would categorize it as accessible to a high school level student (perhaps even an interested GT-level middle school student), but not at the cost of being overly simplistic. It imparts a great deal of information effectually, via well-written text and helpful and copious accompanying photos and illustrations.Of great utility is the glossary, and the use of bold-face for first use of terms defined therein."
1,"Good product, BAD shipping!!!!!!!!!!!","I love this product, but don't order it here. THey throw the bottles in a trash bag, throw that in the box, and you're lucky if you have one bottle that doesn't spill everywhere. I told them about it and they never responded. Buy elsewhere, you will have better luck with how they ship!"
3,Thought it would be the same as on television...,My son didn't enjoy the intermissions very much. He was screaming for the screen to play. I know he needs to get used to it I do think the recess period is a bit boring!
1,The title is mispelled - don't do this for your resume (Resumes?),Clearly it should state Resume and not Resumes. Don't make this kind of spelling errors on your resume as Amazon does.
4,Cordless extension,"The phone came in excellent condition. Just wish the ad had stated that you needed to order the whole package. I ended up ordering the base set and another cordless. But that's ok, as we are putting them to good use."
1,Why did it have to change?,"My family of 4 including two daughters 8 and 6 had been happily watching season 1-3 of Batman the animated series through Netflix. We were all excited to receive the first disc of season 4 and very quickly disappointed. Parents should know that this set is much more violent than the previous seasons. We actually sent the disc back without letting the girls watch most of the episodes. After trying the first three episodes and hoping they would go back to the high-quality, child appropriate yet adult savy style we had enjoyed, they were simply mindless violence and disappointing dialogue. I agree with a previous reviewer that the violence between Harley and the Joker was also not OK for children. I would recommend The Justice League if you are looking for something to watch when you finish the first three seasons of Batman."
4,Best of the four volumes,"While I'm not a huge fan of the more ""cartoony"" animation style of Vol 4, I thought the storylines in this set were overall the best. There was more of an emphasis on Batman battling supervillains, and less of him fighting organized crime types."
4,Not bad at all,"Volume four of Batman Animated was pretty good in my opinion. I rather enjoyed such episodes as ""Over The Edge"" and ""Old Wounds."" That being said, I too did not particularly love the revamp of the animation. It might have worked better had they continued another season on. I had come to love how the first three seasons looked and I didn't particularly like how they made all the characters, especially that of the female figures which were super curvy and lanky. But hey, that's just me.The only other complaint I can really issue is that some of the story lines sort of breach what happened in the previous seasons. Myself, being very attached to the first three seasons became a little annoyed with this issue. Any die hard fan of this series needs to go into this season with a little different mentality and not expect the same treatment of the predecessors.All-in-all, volume 4 really was an enjoyable season with only some minor flaws."
1,Rip off!!!!,I can not believe that I purchased this w/o looking @ the single review on it! What an embarrassment! It was a gift and how awful was it 2 hear that it was not only cheap! But it came with just a tutu a pair of cheaply made shoes and what looked like a nickle cost wand! What the heck is that about?!? It didn't even have a body suit 2 it!!!! TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!
5,Great Magazine,"I have been getting this mag for about 3 years and my sister likes it so much, I got her a subscription!!! Lots of good info, plus recipes....just good reading, good ideas, useful info."
4,Very good--but....,"This is a good magazine with a lot of good advice and articles, however, every month features a new ""astounding diet"" with other diets interspersed in the book. Wish they would do away with that every month. Then I would give ti five stars."
3,Poor Print Quality,"I thought the articles were very good but visually the print quality was very poor, in some of them,such as eyebrows on cheeks and lipstick not just on the lips. This was my first purchase of the magazine so I don't know if this is an ongoing problem or just this issue (May 31 2004)."
4,Love it,"Being a bit of a chubby girl makes finding sexy lingerie difficult. I was really excited about finding this garter belt. It fits perfectly and has really nice stocking clasps. It helps create a smoother silhouette, no muffin top for this girl! The only thing that it doesn't show in the picture is that the back tapers up. I thought it was be the same width all the way around. Instead there is a clasp in the back. I still love it and am really happy with my purchase. Totally worth it."
4,Great fit,This is a great garter belt. It has a good fit and it was true to size. It looks good on as well.
1,Can't get it to work.,"I purchased this recently and was looking forward to the arrival. Upon arrival I quickly found that there are a lot of do's and don'ts. Quite frankly, too much to remember. When I did finally figure it out I was unable to get a correct reading for any of the measurements. My weight was off by 60 pounds (too low)!!! I set it up for my mom as a user, and she also had incorrect readings. I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...completely useless."
2,"Bad for Body Fat, Ok for weight","I've had this scale for 2.5 years and overall think that it's fine as a scale (still using the original batteries). It gives consistent readings to other scales. However, it's body fat function is horrible. It had been giving me a fairly consitent reading of 29-30% body fat, which I found worrisome. When I went to get a physical at the doctor's office, they measured my actual body fat at 21%. My recommendation is to buy a less expensive scale to measure your weight as the body fat function on this isn't worth the extra price."
1,Don't buy it!,"This review is for the HBF-400. I returned mine as defective. I stepped on it 5 times in a row and got different weight readings. Depending upon where you put your feet when you get on it, you get a different weight. I could move my toe 1/2"" and the reading would be different. The bodyfat reading was way off too. About 5% to high. Hopefully mine was defective and the others aren't like it. I wouldn't recommend buying one though since mine was so bad."
2,works fine except for the Body fat feature.,"I have had this scale for a little over a week now and the only problem i have with it is that body fat measurement is way off. I set the user correctly to my age 26 and gender(male). I am 6'3"" and weigh 190lbs, I work out 4 times a week and have a very athletic build. I got on the scale and it read 190lbs then the next reading was body fat%. it said i was carrying around 24% body fat which i know now is about 10% too high since i went to my gym and got it professionally read by a trainer with the gyms equiptment. so if you are looking for a scale that only reads the weight correctly this is the scale for you."
5,Amazing Scale!!,"This scale is wonderful! It works everytime and I love that you can program the scale to your height, gender, and age so you get accurate results! I recommend it! its an amazing product!"
4,Great device and value.,"I have no real complaints. My only fustration was the very vague explaination of BMI and Body fat % and what it means and what are targets for each person body type. You'll have to do that research on your own. Otherwise, buy this."
2,The 400 model,"Very disappointing. I can step on this scale 50 times in a row, with my feet in the same place, on a flat surface... and get 50 different readings. I care less about accuracy and more about reliability, but I don't seem to be getting that with this despite the good reviews I saw regarding reliability. What a bummer."
5,I Love It,"It has made me very happy. But, it has not conformed to the doctor's scale. Of course, I am naked on the Omron and I no longer believe in the doctors' scales that are used by hundreds of people and with clothes and shoes, etc. This scale is my benchmark. I will trust this in my quest for it measures every .10 digital and at 67 I can see the read out."
5,Very Pleased,"I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks. (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.) I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived. It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher. The numbers on it are very large and easy to read. Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita. I can't wait to try all the features. By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised. Great deal for the money!!!"
2,"Accurate scale, but body fat measurement is suspect","This is a nice piece of equipment, seems to be well-made with a nice design. The scale was VERY accurate--no complaints there--but I mostly purchased it to monitor my body fat. That it did not do very well. I followed the instructions to the letter and repeatedly got incorrect numbers. The instructions say this scale is not for highly trained athletes or people with very low body fat, so heed that warning if that describes you."
4,First Body Fat Monitor I've Tried That Works,"The weight measurements are extremely accurate.The fat and muscle percentage measurements are precise. I don't know how accurate they are, since I don't have an accurate method of benchmarking them, but they are consistent, with variations explicable by diet and exercise. I get anomalous readings sometimes, but over the long course of things, the numbers lead me to believe that this is a very useful feature of the scale.I do wish the scale measured hydration levels. This would add an extra dimension to my understanding the fluctuations in the other numbers.Oh. And it looks very, very nice on the bathroom floor. I don't really care about that, but I know some of you out there do."
5,Accurate Bathroom Scale,"After looking at many different scales I chose this based on other ratings. I'd like to add my two cents worth. Many of the digital scales did not seem to perform as well as this one did, plus I like the bmi setting. Having this will help manage my weight better and setting my goal."
2,Would not recommend,"This product has nice features, but the body fat percentage is not at all accurate. I have a Tanita Body Fat Moniter Scale at home, but wanted this one because it has more features. I have also recently had my body fat tested at the gym. This scale measured me 7 to 8% higher in body fat than both what the gym and the Tanita scale said. Since the gym said I was 14% and Tanita said 13% and this scale said I was 21%, I have to belive this scale is off. I returned it. It is no good to me, since it is not correct."
2,A little disappointing,"This product functions nicely, but the body fat percentage is way off. For example, using the Omron HBF-306C Fat Loss Monitor, my Body Fat Percentage is 20%, but using this scale it reads 30%. Great scale and good for measuring progress in fat loss, but not so good for knowing your actual body fat percentage. I'd buy the hand held version by the same company instead."
4,A better scale,"Generally the product delivers on the features. My one gripe is that the manual isn't very intuitive, but navigation of the unit came after some trial and error.Overall it seems to be well made and after using it for about a month I can tell it gives reliable readings."
2,Useless Body Fat Readings,Had this scale for over a month and if all you want is a scale it will work well but the body fat info is completely useless. I wish I would have listened to the posters that mentioned the body fat readings don't work because now I am stuck looking for another way to get my body fat%.The scale looks nice even though it mostly plastic and has a small footprint compared to other scales this is a plus in our smaller bathroom. Reads in .2 pounds and is very repeatable.
2,Measures weight OK but fat % is way off!,"Pros:Robust design, measures weight accrately, easy controls.Cons:Does NOT measure FAT %.I am 180lb, 6ft, 32 inch waist, fairly athletic frame. The body fat % shown for me was 23.6%! A week later, I did a physical check up at a primary care physician which showed 16.5%. I am positive there is no way I can loose 6% of fat in a week.Verdict: If I JUST NEEDED A SIMPLE WEIGHING SCALE I would have paid less and got one!"
4,"It's consistent, if inaccurate","I actually started weighing myself without first using something I know will always weigh the same, but now I always weigh a 5 lb plate before getting on to make sure it's reading the plate the same, and it does.The body fat percentage is super inaccurate, but I think this too is consistent. I always weigh myself in the morning, wearing the same clothes, always after urinating and before eating/drinking anything. With this consistency, I can pay attention to the direction of the change of body fat percentage instead of fixating on the actual number."
4,"Great scale for weighing yourself, but haha bf% is way off","I dont know how they figure the bf% is accurate. I mean haha its off by at least 5 points. I'm about 6'4"" 180lbs and the machine is telling me that I have 20% body fat and am slightly overweight Im practically skin and bones with a little muscle. I've used the Navy formula for calculating body fat and im at about 15% and have got it calculated professionally and it was around 13%.the weighing aspect of the machine is spot on, but the bf% is consistent but no where near accurate."
2,Scale good - Fat monitor bad,"I found the scale to be very accurate, but the fat monitor doesn't work very well at all. Don't get this for the fat monitor..the handheld is much more accurate."
2,Confusing,I am going to send it back. It is confusing to use to set up users then weigh in under your user number. It's too complicated to use at 4:30 in the moring!
4,Scale is as simple or complicated as you want it to be,This scale is very nice. You can use it to simply weigh yourself or also to measure percent of body fat and other measurements. I like it most because it is a good value for your money and because it looks nice in the bathroon; has a modern feel to it.
5,After you reach your goal weight,"If you're in the midst of successful weight loss and close to reaching your goal, get this scale! You wont want to quit the fun of improving your health and this scale gives you a measureable way to keep working on it even when you're only maintaining your weight. It calculates body fat %!"
3,so-so,"I believe the pound measurements are accurate, even showing ounces. i am skeptical about the body fat measurements, as they seem to fluctuate quite a bit from day to day....does body fat really change that easily? i doubt it. i weigh every morning, same time, right after getting up. so, i don't know if this is really doing a good job as far as body fat is concerned. i probably wouldn't buy again if this one broke. just stick with the old dial scale."
4,digital scale,A little complicated at first to use but you get the hang of it. Easy to read would buy it again!!
4,Great scale - Terrible Fat % Monitor,"Despite the fact that the body fat % monitor is way off (it tells me I have the body fat % of an Olympic athlete...which I certainly am not) I still really like this scale. It looks pretty nice, and I like that it gives weight down to the tenths decimal (instead of just the closest whole number). Oddly enough the body fat monitor didn't work when I first got it, then it started working for a few months, then it stopped again. In the end: just don't expect the body fat % feature to work."
3,Good,I like the scale but I don't use all of the functions - otherwise I would probably like it more. It is okay though and acurate as far as I can tell.
2,Very Disappointed !!!,"I received my scale in perfect condition, in a timely manner, and it looks Great. I read the instructions and then attempted to set the scale while looking at the directions. I then tested the scale & got my weight but not the BMI or Body Fat%. I reread and reset the scale-same result. I do find that the weight is correct but have NO idea of the other two values and really wanted that info. I am usually very good at following instructions, but I will try it once more on the weekend and if I do not have any success I will return the scale. I am SOOOOOOO disappointed! After I try to set, I will write a follow-up to t his review."
