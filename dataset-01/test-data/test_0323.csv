4,"Very bright, very small!","Not much else to add besides what the the title says. Oh, the clasp appears to be very secure and not flimsy."
5,A must have!,"As far as the comments here about fake devices...I purchased mine from MICRO-TOOLS...they are indeed authentic products.I've been buying these as gifts for years. They are small, bright and practically indestructible. The battery lasts a long time as well. As an IT guy, I use it all the time working on machines, network cabinets, you name it. Awesome."
4,Great little key chain light,I've used it about once or twice a month - very handy because it's small and on my keychain - right where I need it when I need some light!
4,Great for keychain - short range usage,"Has a few 1 star ratings due to not being real ""Photon II"" light but it's still a great light. I don't know what a real ""Photon II"" light is but I'm very happy with my purchase. It's a very small light so don't expect the world from it but in small spaces it's very bright. Wish the price was better for the size of the item."
1,FAKE - NOT Authentic Photon II (LRI),"I received a FAKE ""Photon II Micro-light"". I do not understand why the descriptions say Photon II Micro-light (LRI), then a cheap knock-off is mailed. Very deceiving. I returned it for refund. Very disappointing. About a year ago, I purchased an authentic unit from Amazon. And now, I got this fake one. So, I don't know what's going on."
2,tacky and title misleading,"* this is not a book on glue gun projects- the title is misleading* most of the projects are not very original - except for a couple of things- the copper tape frames, tin box art- but these projects are more fun for kids making bitsy things for their friends* the projects are not well explained- if you want step by step instructions with photos etc- this doesnt have that at all.. its a photo of final project with sometimes very general instructions on how to do them .. which is not good for young people despite the projects being very kiddy..* where are those glue gun projects??? .. even the adhesive/product descriptions arent good."
4,Very Cute!,"Bought two for our dogs (lab/german shepherd mix & blood hound mix, both about 60lbs.) So cute! Thankful my dogs are patient with me for forcing them to wear costumes, or maybe they just don't know how silly they look.Anyway, I cannot give this 5 stars because there is nothing to attach the costume tail to the dogs' tails. I had to cut a couple holes under the tail to slip over the dogs'. Did not work as I'd hoped, so it just looked like they had two tails.I still recommend it, someone else might be more creative with the tail issue."
3,They say it's the best,"I bought this book because this is the #1 Gerek-English lexicon today. I have to confess that I was a lite disappointed when I started to use it. The title says that it is a Lexicon of the ""New Testament and Early Christian Literature."" Yet, in the past few weeks I had many occasions when I tried to find a Greek word used by one of the Church Fathers, but the word wasn't listed in the lexicon. But it is a useful help for those who want to have a better understanding of the New Testament."
4,packed with growing tips and recipes,"This is a delightful small book that should be on every herb-lover's shelf. After a general introduction about growing herbs, each of 19 sections covers an herb from basil to thyme. Each section has a nice line drawing, specific growing tips and up to 15 recipes for using the herb. If you're harvesting your dill and want some ideas for how to use it, you'll reach for this book. A final chapter is entitled, ""Herbal Desserts & Sweet Herbal Baking."" It's a smallish book, worth the counter space! With flaps for holding the place on your favorite recipes."
2,packaging,"The paper splits easily...so it should be packaged in cardboard..not paper..this package did split,causing the paper targets to split..."
2,mehh,"it was OKAY...i mean, it felt extremely thick, and like, sticky..not a fan of covergirl..and it only lasted like, an hour...soo yeahh NOPE, never again!"
3,Peretti returns!,"I have to admit that I was just a little disappointed by this book (I really missed Tal and the rest of the Host of Heaven) but the characters and situations were compelling enough for me to turn every page with anticipation. This book questions Christian readers and, I believe, suggests that we look at our lives and the way we live. ""Brendan Nichols"" is just a fantastic villain (or anti-hero) and you can really feel sorry for him. He's sad, angry, and alone. Much like a lot of us in this world. A great read and great introduction to newcomers of Peretti's work. Can't wait for his next novel!"
4,Peretti is back!!,"I only give this novel 4 stars because I thought it was very slow going in the beginning. I actually got really close to returning the book--but I hung in there and I am glad I did. The book went from slow to incredible. I loved all of Peretti's novels--up until The Oath which was a little out there for me so I was hesitant in purchasing The Visitation. Up until The Oath, I had always been satisfied with Peretti's novels--I loved the ""Darkness"" books, The Prophet and Tilly. I heard he has a new novel coming out in November and I can't wait to read it."
3,Not up to his other work.,"I enjoy F. Peretti's work, I have read most of his other books. I was excited when this book came out, but I was disappointed in reading it. It was written so ""unlike"" the style of F. Peretti that if I didn't know he wrote it I wouldn't have believed it."
3,The Visitation,"Good Frank's style but I have found so different comparing with ""Piercing the Darkness"". People seem to be unreal, God unreal; Frank wanted to express his own threats and doubts but the whole story gives the strange feel, artificial I wolud say. I was really impressed by first two books from this author, but ""The Visitation"" made me disappointed. It can be a fiction but rather pseudochristian fiction. I gave up buying ""The Oath"" having read ""Visitation"". Generally, I would not recommend that book."
2,not recommended,"This product arrived packed professionaly and in a very timely manner.The product itself is not at all worth the money. Creel lid does not open properly and the handle on the back broke off the first time I tried to raise it. The lid is so bad that I have decided to remove it entirely and replace the cheap construction with leather that I had to go purchase.Though this item was not going to be used as it was intended, which I am glad because it wouldn't have made it through one fishing trip I am sure, it still should have been of some quality."
3,"Fabulous Jewelry from Found Objects: Creative Projects, Simple Techniques (Lark Jewelry Book)",I found this book to be interesting and fun but not as inspirational as I had hoped. I'm sure that I will use the techniques in the future however.
5,Best live CD,"I love this Cd! Only thing i wish was different was that ""sentimental street"" was not just Kelly with the piano. Don't get me wrong this sounds excellent on this Cd but i like the ""7 Wishes"" video version a little better cuz of the guitars by Watson ang Gillis. Sing me away is my favorite song and glad they put this on the Cd! Get it everyone!"
4,I use as a styling mousse,"Since I received the Rene Furterer treatment, I have used it every day. I really like that I don't have to use a separate styling product. It adds some shine to my hair, plus some volume."
5,Outstanding! The Mississippi Delta by way of Seattle,"Recently I had the great good fortune to sit 15 feet away from Kelly Joe Phelps at the Newport Folk Festival, listening to his incredible guitar riffs and unique Mississippi blues style. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After listening to his set I ran, not walked, to the record tent to buy this Album. He's something else!"
5,EXCELLENT-- A REAL WINNER!!!,"Dine out and Lose Weight is a sure road to success. If you follow the plan, which is much easier to understand and follow than the ZONE or Managing the ZONE, you WILL LOSE WEIGHT Guaranteed!! I have lost 45 pounds and my wife has lost 20 plus 3 dress sizes since Aug '97--actually we did it in 3 months and have been in Phase II since mid-November. A number of co-workers are also on the plan with similar results."
5,"It's a great book, but difficult to understand right","Yes, this is a great book about loosing weight. However, it seems not easy to grasp the essence. The previous two reviewers apparently interpret it as 'not combining proteins and carbohydrates' and 'low carbohydrates' respectively. In fact the basic rule is not to combine fats and carbohydrates. See my further comments at http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/4582"
5,Liza's Back is here to stay.,"From an audience point of view - ...When I listen to the US recording it was as amazing as the sold out shows I saw in London.My personal favourite is `Something Wonderful', the song was heard so many times before but Liza really put a new angle to it and the lyrics was sung only Liza can at this stage of her life.Another song `What Did I Have That I Don't Have'was by far the best interpretation I heard by any singer. The `Never Never Land' was another great song with the right touch to finish the song. In years to come `Some People' and `Rose's Turn' will only be remember as Liza's song.Liza has reached perfection there is nothing that's need to be change.Lastly we must thank Mr Gest for being the force behind this legendary event."
5,Electrifying,"After a shaky start, this CD hits the stratosphere somewhere around the end of track #2 (""Something Wonderful"") and never stops soaring. Anyone who attended the Beacon concerts the nights this was recorded will never forget the experience and this CD is an excellent representation of Liza's incredible back-from-the-ashes return.Just about every track is a bonafide showstopper, but fasten your seat belts once you get to ""What Did I Have That I Don't Have?"" From there on, Minnelli tops herself repeatedly until you are almost in the realm of the supernatural.The ""But The World Goes Round"" on this CD is definitive, topping even her 1987 Carnegie Hall version.This CD is a sure bet for fans, and it will most likely bring her new ones if marketed correctly."
4,Magnetic blind,I liked the magnetic blind very much except I thought that I had ordered the shorter version. So I have quite a bit of bulky excess below my window. Other than that it works and such a great invention. I would recommend this to everyone needing privacy on their steel doors with windows. Thank you for the speedy shipment too.
5,Quick & Easy,I had these hung up in about 5 minutes. It took longer to get them out of the package than up on my french doors. Love them. They stay in place and I open these doors alot. I have two dogs that are always wanting in & out all day long. Wish I had found them sooner!
4,Easy to install,This item allowed us to install blinds on a metal door without having to drill into the metal. The blinds were easy to install and they look good.
4,as advertised.,so far so good. Only bad thing is that we did not count on a one year old getting into them.
4,Just the product I needed.,"For an un-handy man like me, this product filled the bill. Just as advertised, no tools were required for installation, and the blinds went up quickly. A drawback for the product is that the slats are thin and easily bent. I wouldn't recommend it for people who have children, as the blinds wouldn't stand up to any abuse from mischievous little hands."
3,Left me wanting more,"This biography of the cranky JQA and his gentle wife, Louisa Catherine, got off to a good start. It opens with a vivid account of their wedding at the church of All Hallows Barking. Unfortunately, Shepard never delves deep enough into the volatile relationship between the president and his ""fine lady."" I was left wondering WHAT exactly they felt for one another. Did they love one another, despite the pain each inflicted? I think so....but this biography does not provide the answer. The hauntingly beautiful quote that the title is taken from says more than the entire book: ""It was a marriage of light to shadow, of spring to winter, of heart to cannibal..."" There are some good moments toward the end. The description of an aged JQA's triumphant tour through the states he loved is fantastic (his disgusted daughter-in-law got sick of the cheering crowds and went home!) I would reccomend Paul Nagel's ""Descent from Glory"" over this."
1,What a POS,There's a reason this kit is so cheap. It's the biggest piece of s*** on earth. It doesn't hold a double din deck properly. The screws that come with the kit to attach the faceplate to the dash kit are way too short and won't make a solid connection to keep the two together. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on the Scosche. Way easier to put together and looks great
5,holiday fun,"Sweet, and goofy. Zooey Deschanel lets us hear her voice (hurrah!) A nice tale of renewing Christmas spirit, and although I'm not a Ferrell fan, he is pretty spot-on with the silly elf thing, only annoying occasionally. Kids will love it, Santa, elves, reindeer, and some story. And Bob Newhart, a classic."
4,Funny and Heartwarming,"I was pleasantly surprised. I expected to dislike the movie..the trailers looked absurd and the idea of this overgrown ""elf"" in the costume...I thought the movie would be a real dud.Instead I was glued to my seat, it was funny and sweet and tender. I even shed a few tears during the caroling at the end."
1,THERE SHOULD BE A PLACE FOR 0 STARS: THE WORST MOVIE EVER!,"This movie wasn't even remotely funny. I can't believe the people who say it's a ""smartly written, cute movie."" It's nothing like that! I took my kids to see it and whispered to my daughter halfway through, ""This is horrible!"" She agreed with me, and if a child's word (may I remind you children are what the movie was aiming at?) was against the movie, it must be horrible. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen."
4,What's a Christmas Gram? I want one!,"Elf is a Christmas story with a twist.The twist is provided, in the midst of a cute Christmas story, by the writing of Jon Favreau and the performance of Will Ferrell. The movie manages to stay innocent, while still allowing Will to be expressive with his natural brand of humor. It's a Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy, children and adults alike, as it appeals to both the kid in all of us, as well as our more adult sensibilities.The Infinifilm edition includes 2 discs: One contains the Widescreen version and special features and the other contains the Full Screen version and special features. There is plenty on the interactive DVDs to keep you busy for quite a while, including quality featurettes, deleted scenes, games you (or the kids) can play, commentaries and even DVD-rom features.This is a new favorite to add to the Christmas list."
4,Majormike,A movie for everybody. Both adults and kids will love it. Funny and a great movie for the whole to watch together.
5,this movie is the best movie ever!!!,"elf was halarious, thats all there is to it. every single scene was halarious. don't listen to that guy named malinda k kay-because shes wrong. im a picky movie watcher and i thought elf was the best movie ever!!!! i love a lot of movies but i thought elf was the best."
3,Suitable for kids,"The kids enjoyed it. Adults not so much. Am not a fan of Will Ferrell, but he was easier to take in this film. Not so crude."
3,Meh.,Had a few humorous scenes. Kinda lame. Maybe I was just tired when I watched it. I have friends who love this movie and watch it every December.
4,Laugh Out Loud,Will Ferrell continues to delight and entertain with his witty sense of humor and hilarious antics! His child-like performance will have you laughing out loud.
1,would not buffer and was very choppy,would not buffer and was very choppy. a waist of money. i had to stop it and just go order it on my xbox.
2,A little too corny........,A cute story but a little too corny for me......It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter than it was.
5,Great Movie!,Read the screenplay and then watched the movie. Will Ferrell did a great job in this one! Very cool and heart-warming :D
3,Mediocre,"Not very well thought out Christmas movie. Don't care for Will Farrell and Ed Asner as Santa..... Uh no. Almost seemed as though they ad libbed through the entire movie. Even the addition of Bob Newhart didn't help. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
5,"So, so funny","Will Ferrell's performance in ""Elf"" approached genius for me. The plot is pedestrian, but you can't help but be charmed by Ferrell and his elf antics. The supporting cast also shines. The scene that most stands out for me and still makes me giggle is when Buddy (Ferrell) declares that a department store Santa is most certainly NOT the real Santa (Buddy would know, as he lived with the real Santa at the North Pole for most of his life). I laughed so hard in the theater for this scene, and so did much of the audience.Buy or rent this--you won't be disappointed!"
2,Tolerable... Just Tolerable,"No, the movie was not completely unbearable as many of his other movies are. Some parts were even cute. However, it still lacked real wit, real talent. I don't see how it could appeal to anyone over 15."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I am definitely not a fan of Will Ferrell but I went ahead and bought this movie based on the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised that I actually liked the movie. It was cute and charming with a fair amount of pretty funny scenes. You have to laugh at the silliness of it all but overall, good holiday fun."
5,A new favorite,I'm not at all a fan of Will Ferrell but this is easily one of my top 3 favorite Christmas movies.
4,good Christmas movie,A new classic holiday movie. It just doesn't feel like Christmas time at our house until we watch Elf at least once.
4,Rented this for the children at Christmas,"It is an amusing family movie which was enjoyed thoroughly by my children (8 and 5) While Will Ferrell can be a bit annoying in his comic excess, my children laughed out loud over his antics during several parts of the movie."
5,"Elf: Sweet, simple, satisfying entertainment!","Elk is a sweet movie that is ""family friendly."" Kids of all ages can watch it, be entertained, and not have to worry about the content. Watch it with your kids and grandkids and have ""quality time"" talking about how important family is and what it means to love others even whe they don't deserve it."
5,Classic Christmas Movie,Great family Christmas movie - has become a family tradition and now we won't have to wait until it comes on TV anymore.
5,FUNNY,We watch this every CHristmas season as a family and just laugh the whole time Great way to spread Christmas Cheer!
4,Will Ferrell Makes this Movie !,"Elf is the story of Buddy (Will Ferrell) the oversized and adopted elf who leaves the north pole in search of his real human father (James Caan) who works in New York City. Elf's weak points probably come in an overlong and somewhat contrived ending, but Will Ferrell, a great supporting cast (including Bob Newhart), and the New York City backdrop still make it fun to watch. In the world of Christmas movies, Elf is probably not a classic when compared to A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street, or more modern Christmas classics such as Prancer and A Christmas Story, but it is good Christmas fun."
1,No BluRay in case,"I bought this to watch with my family before Christmas. Arrived last night and I opened it this evening to find only the Digital Copy and no BluRay disk inside. Just an empty slot where it should be. Disk was shrink-wrapped and all, just no disk. I ordered a replacement and it shows it will arrive the day after Christmas. Bad Amazon experience...."
5,Funny!,"We loved this movie! We bought it to add to our Christmas movie arsenal, and we are glad we did."
2,Horrible Comedy...Not Worth Buying,"When I saw trailers and clips for the film Elf, I thought it would be a huge comedy production with tons of non-stop jokes and comedic situations. Sadly, this wasn't a reality. Elf's storyline begins with an ""orphan"", slipping into Santa's sack during Christmas Eve and ends up being raised by elves. He later tries to find his real father and goes to New York City in order to find him. Though the way he reacts from going from the peaceful and magical world of the North Pole to the bustling streets of New York is comedic at least, but his situations can't make you really laugh out loud. Though there are one or two memorable scenes, the storyline is nothing new and several of the jokes are hardly funny. The climax itself is nothing exciting [Santa's sleigh trying to escape from the Central Park Rangers]or memorable. Rent it if you have to, but don't buy it."
5,An Awesome Movie,'Elf' is an absolute great movie with tons of laughter and courage. I would reccomend this movie to anyone.
4,Not Too Bad...,"The Total Gym 1700 Club is a pretty good piece of equipment. You definately feel the resistance, and wake up feeling a little sore after the first workout (at least I did). The DVD is pretty useful too. The machine is quite heavy, but assuming I bought the machine to get physically fit I guess the weight is not a bad thing.There were 2 things I found as a drawback to this product. The first is that the machine is quite rigid and hard to change levels of resistance. The second is that the ""wheels"" that the machine are supposed to come with were cracked and did not work. They are made of a brittle plastic and probably wouldn't work had they been in perfect condition. I had to resort to carrying the machine instead of rolling it."
3,totally alright,"Been using the total gym for a few weeks. It arrived with smashed roller wheels, but it only took a week to receive replacements.The TG works ok, but to follow the exercise routines you have to hook and unhook the pulley from the board. This is VERY DIFFICULT to do and discourages following the routine. Also the board roll is bumpy not smooth as you would expect.On the plus side, the exercises improve flexibility and work well for men and women. So it's better than nothing, but at a high price."
4,Nice equipment!,Excellent machine to have a full work out on! I don't think it will replace the gym completely but almost there! Very easy to use and to change between workouts although wen it comes to put it back in the storage I'm kind of lazy so I always have it assembled!I would Definitely recommend it.
2,Depressing and boring,"I liked the first book so much better compared to this one. These stories started off being good but towards the middle to end I couldn't get through any of them. They weren't ""feel good"" stories like the first book. It's much different than the other chick lit short story anthologies out there."
1,An Aweful Movie,"My opinion on the movie the Molly McGuires, was it is horrible. This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There is no real plot or any point through out the movie. This movie did not hold my interst an I do not recomend for anyone to even think about watching this movie. There was saying that is was a great portrayel of the mines but there was hardly any time spent in the coal mines. The movie was based around trying to capture the Molly McGuires. An there were parts added on to the movie that had absolutly nothing to do with the hardships of working in the mines. That is my review on the Molly Mcguires."
1,hate ms troutman,The movie was so borning that I all most feel a sleep.It was about men in the coal mines.And about having a guy to tell the police what they were going to do. Then they would make it look like he had done something by hinting him over the head.
4,THE REVIEW,"This movie gave me an idea of what it was like for Irish immigrants who worked in the coal mines. It conveyed the horrible conditions that the workers had to endure. It portrayed the secret society of the Molly Maguires very well. You could see both points of view, the coal miners and the owners and police. I thought the movie was very educational, while it lacked excitment."
5,"Very powerful movie, depicts the harshness of labor movement","This movie gives viewers insight to the harsh reality of the industrialization of the United States and the exploitation of immigrants in the coal mines. The characters offer a complexity of emotions as they struggle to survive at the mercy of the powerful mining companies and corrupt police system of 1870s. Sean Connery gives a solid performance as Jack Kehoe, a Molly Maguire whose lack of trust of outsiders is penetrated by a company detective posing as a coal miner. The story is not only entertaining but also historically accurate."
1,awful they're barely even in the mine,"I think this movie is a bad Sean Connery movie,its about a bunch of bad miners looking like they are doing the right thing by blowing stuff up.They think they are special because they are imigrants so what we all were at some point in time, they just had bad timing.Plus Sean isnt even the real star of the movie that is a disgrace to movies, he barely even talks during the whole movie thats why it [was so bad], and the fact they are not in the mine long enough for people to say its a good mining movie.If you got a problem with your boss you dont kill him you ask for a raise, or if that dont work quit dont kil [...]. If you dont believe me watch the movie yourself although I dontthink its anygood but who am I to stop you."
3,Molly Maguires,In my 10 years as student I've have seen lots of historical films. The Molly Maguires had some true points and non true. The film portaed them as; well the good guys and the mining company as the bad guys. As in real life they were roughnecks who in their sabotage they actully killed innocent people who where their own. But to the film itself was as my rating was ok.
4,Great product for Musical scores and Sound Effects.,I've had hours of fun and productivity with this Prodikeys DM! All of the Instrument VST plug-ins work flawlessly. It's easy to learn and produces very satisfying results.
4,"Book is well done, perhaps too technical","Well done, explanations at times are a little too technical, fun book to read"
2,Gentry- not so good,Very disapointed in the CD no original artist. Was hoping for something better this did not deliver. Don't waste your money.
1,YOU'LL BE SORRY!!!,"Not one original singer on this putrid album. Brought two months ago, and literally don't know where I laid it down and get this, I'm glad I can't find it! Can't say you weren't WARNED!!!!!"
4,"Gets to the point, not overly technical","Obviously a book with a limited audience, but if you need this information it's a good overview. The body of the book is straightforward and not overly technical. Some good diagrams and photos. Read it and spare your doctor the embarrassing questions."
1,Adyashanti goes in circles,"I was so very disappointed with this series. Adyashanti spoke in circles, never stayed to a particular topic or point. He often contradicted something he said five minutes before. I could not bring myself to finish the series."
4,Very Inspiring and Useful,Adyashanti is avery accessible and down to earth dude while talking about subtle and deep spiritual material. He does not come across as arrogant or holier than thou as so many other so called gurus or teachers. Many practical tips and great stories included in this set. Highly recommended!
3,Good for the home cook,Intreresting and fairly easy to make recipes that would please guests at any dinner party. Makes a great gift. For the foodie.
4,Acoustic Blues,"After seeing Terry Robb on you tube, I was dying to check out some of his work. I love acoustic guitar so this cd seemed right.I was not disappointed. Great selection of tunes and the production was top notch. I can recommend this cd to anyone.I look forward to my next purchase of Terry Robbs music."
4,blast from the past,"Loved this book when I was in Junior high [circa late 70s], my school library had a copy. Bought it a few months ago to reread and jeez I was surprised! I did not realize what a Anti-gun book this was ! I assumed in Junior high it was sort of a pro-gun book? Even did a book report on this very book. Shows my lack of true reading comprehension in my formative years (ha ha )! And even though I am a NRA member and diehard 2nd amendment believer, I STILL think this book is a great read. The author uses a lot of obsure facts and interesting stories that make it an interesting book. Even though some of his theories have not panned out of the coarse of the following decades since the book was written; and you may disagree with his line of thought, I still would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in firearms and how it is a part of our nation; both good and bad. Already have 2 friends that want to borrow it when I am done with it..."
3,A very poor quality DVD,"Comprei este DVD aqui no Brasil e realmente avalio que tem muito baixa qualidade em áudio e vídeo, bem como ocorre perda de sincronismo entre som e imagem no momento em que o editor ""junta"" as duas metades do show, e isso é lamentável. Se o produto à venda na Amazon for de origem brasileira, desaconselho a compra. Também no entendo porque uma gravadora ""de peso"" ainda no lanou este título."
5,Very handy reference book,"I got this book as part of the requirements to be a doula and a La Leche League leader. It's fantastic. The spiral binding makes it very easy for me to use while nursing my son - it's the only book I've been able to read cover-to-cover since he was born because of this. It also has a very easy-to-read layout and a great index. I use it all of the time when giving advice to other nursing mothers. As far as breastfeeding texts go, it's complete, handy, and cheap by comparison. I'd recommend it to anybody who is nursing or going to nurse."
4,Fine product as long as it is for your Axim,"I got this for my Axim X50 and it works fine with no installation issues. Pretty standard keyboard. I had the same exact keyboard for my Ipaq and this one works the exact same way although it was even easier to install for the Dell vice the HP.Just watch out like the others reviewers say and make sure it is for your specific Axim. As long as it is, you will be satisfied. An attachable keyboard is worth it if you use your pocket PC much at all.I gave 4 stars vice 5 only because of the somewhat nebulous compatibility issues."
5,Great Book,I love this book. Not only does it give good iteas for what to dry but how to build a dryer. This is just great.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. 20MINS OF THIS DVD WAS THE INTRODUCTION ON THE GEORGE WILLBORN ""TURN AROUND"" COMEDY DVD. MICHAEL BAISDEN IS A RADIO HOST AND HE'S TAKING CALLS FROM PEOPLE ASKING, "" DO WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT""? ALL YOU SEE IS MICHAEL AT WORK INSIDE THE RADIO STUDIO AND HE'S COMMENTING ON WHAT CALLERS ARE SAYING. IF YOU HAVE TO CALL A RADIO STATION TO FIND OUT IF A WOMEN KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS, THEN THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU DON'T HAVE A WOMEN! WAIT FOR IT COME IN REDBOX AND USE PROMO CODE ""DVDONME"" SO YOU CAN RENT IT FOR FREE (IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS GARBAGE)!!!"
5,An Uplifting and Spiritual Experience,"I was so uplifted by reading this book. It was so honest and the spirituality was just outstanding. I like the point he pressed as how these children and adults look at things literally. It tells you that they are not inventing these stories. I have a grandson with Aspergers and do know just how literally they see things. I am impressed with William's insight and knowledge and hope he continues to provide this special care to all that need him. The book and William himself are true inspirations. Some may feel a little uneasy with his findings, but I just say have an open mind and let things fall as they will. Thank you William for having the courage to take this challenge. God Bless"
2,Fun but more like an article than a book,"This is a fun little book, but it's more like a magazine article than a book. You can read it in an hour or two. Don't buy it -- just get it from the library or read it at the bookstore instead."
1,Clumsy and annoying - can't stand the writer's voice!,"I could not bring myself to finish this, which was a sad waste because I had purchased hardback volumes I & II on the hype. Gee, brilliant idea: listen to the publisher's hype! Never again. Can't tell whether this series or Marcos' Eyes of God were more poorly written. two-dimensional, obvious characters, painful dialogue, a plot which you can smell coming a mile away...UGH! The concept is probably the only thing that doesn't bite. Honestly, reading this was like choking down over-cooked peas. My mind gladly leapt at the chance to dig into the new David Farland work. Do yourself a favor and skip this in favor of Russell, Martin, Farland, ...heck, even the formulaic but well-written Drake or Salvatore. If you already bought this, put it in your car trunk in case you roll off into a ravine and are stuck for a week with no food or something..."
1,Bad,"Really bad writing. If this book was $1, it would still be a waste of money. Seriously, it is probably one of the worst books I have ever read."
2,Fantasy Marooned,"I was eagerly awaiting the publication of ""The Fifth Sorceress"" last summer. Once I began reading, I developed a sinking feeling that this was not going to live up to my expectations. Mr Newcomb's fantasy kingdoms are exquisitely designed from a magical and architectural standpoint. The principal drawback is his spiteful, venemous depictions of women.Either his women characters are wanton temptresses or insecure royal dolts. His one sided perceptions maroon this novel, teeming with promise in a confusing hodgepodge of sordid sexuality and misogynist rambling. The saving grace of this novel is the well delineated fantasy settings and the unceasing barrage of constant action and activity. Mr Newcomb has talent but needs the sensitivity to portray female characters in a more sensitive light."
1,Horrible....Shallow characters....cliche storyline..,"I really have to say this book was not well written. The author seems to be obsessed with sexual fetishes and rape...and weak ""save me"" type female characters who play up to ""cliche"" male hero lead character...No suprises in this novel...good and evil are clearly defined...no conflict (other than rape and butchery)....nothing to capture my emotions and I couldn't relate to any characters... Author needs to learn about character development and focus on a good storyline rather than cheap shock value events...stringed together to come to a cliche ending...."
2,Can't think of a reason to recommend it.,"Not a flat out terrible book, but definitely a notch below averages. The author whips out more cliches than Mickey Spillane. He even uses the phrase ""milky white thighs"" at one point. The characters are uninteresting, and represent nothing new or exceptional in fantasy. The plot's so-so, but then so are a lot of plots. I dropped it about halfway through because I just didn't care a bit about what happened (of course maybe it got better as it went along). About the most exceptional thing I can say about it is that it had more sex and violence than usual, but, trust me, that's not a reason to read it."
3,not for small teeth,"I found that if you buy this for smaller children, after they play they bite and drink the water out of the pens! The pen stands up well against the abuse too! Easy to fill and empty when put away for storage."
3,A good start...,"This has a good set of tips and starter recipes. The book uses ideas of community and/or group cooking, although it is not required. Some of the concepts explained are basic things anyone who grew up in a budget-aware household will know, and could find a bit annoying (one of my friends stated ""Who needs a book to figure out how to double a recipe and freeze half of it""). Others who had no previous interest in cooking(or the chance to learn) but want to know now, will love this book (friend two stated, ""Oh my God, I didn't know it could be this easy, who taught you to do this?). I used the recipes I liked and gave the book to friend two. She loved it so much she bought the follow up."
2,No photos?,"I was so excited to receive this book and while I know this review is premature I just can't help it, as my excitement quickly fizzled when I opened the book and realized there are no pictures.This should have been something I noticed when skimming the other reviews of the book, but somehow missed. I'm the type of person that needs a picture of the finished product to entice me to make a certain recipe and while I cannot comment on the actual food at this moment, I just wanted to mention to future buyers that there are no photos.If you're a savvier cook I'm sure that will not dissuade you from buying this book."
4,"Great Book, Pity About the Binding","This cookbook is great! The recipes use ingredients you probably have sitting in your pantry right this minute. The font is clear and easy to read. Every recipe I have made has turned out great. I especially love the detailed instructions for going about freezing the meals, then preparing the meal from the freezer.My only complaint is the cheap binding that the book has. The spine cracked the first time I opened it to use a recipe, lying partially flat on my counter. Now, two weeks later, pages are already falling out. I'm planning on taking it to my local copy center to see if they can spiral bind the entire book. Otherwise, I'll 3-hole punch it and use a binder.Perhaps for the next edition they should consider a spiral binding."
5,A must have for any freezer cooks or busy moms!,This book has easy recipes! They taste wonderful and are cinch to prepare for cooking and/or the freezer! I love the cranberry chicken the best!Highly recommend!
5,Great book!!,"This book is great! I've only cooked 3 of the recipies so far, but my husband was thoroughly impressed. We just recently had our first child, and having easy meals that require little to no thought is incredibly helpful!"
3,Not all recipes are freezer friendly!,"I have tried about 1/4 of the recipes in this book and have not been blown away. Many of the side dish recipes are not freezer friendly. The authors just say that the recipe is too good not to include, but non-freezable recipes should really not take up space in a freezer cookbook."
3,Good,"This book was helpful. I don't like that you have to get a lot of the recipes ""ready"" and still have to go home & cook them for an hour or so-that to me is not a timesaver. Overall there were some helpful ideas, recipes, and even baked desserts!"
4,So far so good,Great addition to my collection of 30 day recipe books. It is very colorful with great ideas. Haven't started my 30 day cooking adventure yet - just collecting info currently. Research is everything :o)
2,Disappointing,"I've been doing the ""freezer meals"" thing for a few years - both at home and the stores where you can prepare meals. These recipes are just OK, and you can get more info and better recipes from the many *free* recipe websites that also have photos and reviews. The measurements for multiple quantities and other tips are a good feature if this is a new way of cooking for you."
3,fair book,"Realy helpful book for a busy families, that dont have time for cooking. if you dont have time to prepare every day, this will help you!"
2,Not worth the money,"Not enough entree recipes and no side items to speak of to make it worthwhile. Far too many appetizers, breads and desserts. As a busy mom that's not what I need. And a lot of the recipes call for 1+ hours in the oven once thawed. Not feasible on a weeknight."
4,Dinner's in the Freezer cookbook review,This cookbook is great! It contains many yummy recipes that can be made and frozen to be used at a later time. I have found that making 4-5 dishes and freezing them lasts me for a couple weeks of dinners for 2 people and doesn't cause as much mess and stress during a busy week.
3,Only good to watch for Louise Fletcher.,"I have not read the book (though I've been told this leaves out the major tone of V.C Andrews' novel) but I bought this solely for Louise Fletcher's appearance. She is great, playing the evil grandmother. A note to V. C. Andrews fans who hated this: watch other Louise Fletcher movies to appreciate her (Check out ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST, for which she won an Oscar). This film takes a long time to get going, but Louise Fletcher makes it worth while. One of her best performances."
2,Could have been a much better movie,While I love the book (and all others V.C Andrews wrote) the movie is terrible. If it wasn't for Louise Flecther the movie would have gotten no stars from me. She is the only actress in the whole movie who can act. I don't remember Cathy being that whiny in the book. The actor who played Chris whould have done better in a light hearted teen movie instead of a serious drama. The movie also lacked things found in the book. Where was the parts where Chris watched Cathy dance? That was what made the book so heartbreaking. The movie also never went into the rage that Cathy felt at her mother for not seeing that she was becomin a young lady. The ending was also terrible. By not having the mother marry Bart in the middle (as in the book) you are leaving out a major part of the movie.
1,Wonderful movie but DO NOT BUY TOP TEN MEDIA'S VERSION!,"Flowers In The Attic is an amazing, unique, and moving movie. However if you buy the one put out by ""Top Ten New Media"" you will be terribly disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!! You would get a better recording by pointing a camera at a snowy TV and recording it. The picture is horrific, grainy and dark. The scene selections that pop up the minute you put in the DVD actually SHOW THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE. How stupid!Please be aware when purchasing this DVD. I have placed a photo of the cover of their version, its not the same as the good quality version put out by Anchor Bay. Make sure you buy Anchor Bay's version and NOT TOP TEN NEW MEDIA'S!"
3,only for die-hard fans,i first saw this movie many years ago and thought it was a bit good then i read the book years later which is so much better and different than the movie. this movie is just about nothing like the book. so much is cut out and even little details are changed. but this movie is kinda good in it's own way.
4,A great recreation,"This movie was almost exactly the same as the book. except the ending. i wanted to scream hen i saw the ending. it wasn't even a similation but a completely different ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, but put it this way. if this ending had been in the book, it would have completely eliminated the possibility of a 2nd and 3rd book. It was a good movie but a horid ending. That's why i gave it 4 stars and not 5"
3,Bland and Boring,"The casting and acting is superb. So there's credit given where it is due.However, the plot of this movie, when compared to the actual novel of the same name written by V. C. Amdrews, is just pathetic. The movie's ending stinks, the characters weren't developed hardly at all, and more than half of the things that happened in the attic were left out of the movie.If I rated the movie based on the novel, it wouldn't even get one star. If you loved the movie, you would absolutely LOVE the book."
1,Horrid,i have read the book and seen the movie and the movie is so different that the tital should nat even be flowers in the attic i mean where is the love scean between criss and cathy or the doll house or the lake that are in the book
4,Flowers in the Attic draws you into a world of realistic horror.,"The acting is great, the plot is realistic and truly disturbing. The sexual tension is ever present yet very real for many people. The ending is completely unexpected. Flowers in the Attic is a horror/mystery without the fake computer graphics and scary masks. It does an excellent job of looking at the human condition. Just imagine yourself in the characters position!"
2,I know why almost everyone gave this movie a bad review!,"You know why? You know why. . .because you-know-what didn't happen. And you all know what I mean. Admit it! You were all looking forward to it and IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! Why do you think everyone plunked down their hard-earned cash to see this piece of junk? Nobody cared about the scenery or whether the grandmother looked like the grandmother as she was described in the book. The disappointment lies in the fact that the guy who played Chris looked like a total L.A. jerk and that. . .well, everyone knows what DIDN'T HAPPEN in this piece of celluloid (or videotape). . ."
3,good while it lasts,"i've had several of these cushions. They are great and very comfortable for a while. After a few months, they begin to leak and are no good any more. I don't want to be buying one of these every three or four months. I'm going to search for something else."
1,"I think The Therapy Connection at HPMS, Inc. sold my information","I am a young, healthy person. I ordered this for a friend in a wheelchair and ever since then I am getting telemarketer calls from people who think I have diabetes or need similar services. I have never ordered anything else in this market so I am 99% sure that my information was sold by this company and I am now being harassed because of it. I would avoid ""The Therapy Connection at HPMS Inc."" like the plague unless you enjoy telemarketers."
5,Great for travel,"For a number of years I have had back and sciatic problems that are worsened by sitting on the horrible seats that most airlines have. This has been a great addition to my carry-on and the amount of discomfort I experience is greatly reduced to almost none. Previous reviews mention not putting in too much air, that is especially true in an airplane as the cushion will become more firm with elevation. The construction seems good and I am now using this at my desk chair each day as well. The one, very small, draw back is that the filler tube will often pop out and if it is in the front it can irritate my leg."
3,Inflatable Seat Cushion,"My wife had back surgery. She needed something to soften up the ride in our rather stiffly suspended car - especially on the less than smooth freeways of today. The problem with it is that the surface does not permit her to slip across easily to a proper sitting position. Putting a piece of more ""slippery"" plastic over the top has made it usable for her."
3,"Soft, but not durable","I got this cushion for my car to help with back pain.I have since tried two other cushions. This was by far the softest. But it has a major drawback. It is very fragile. Mine only lasted about six weeks. When it popped two holes the first time, they were easy to find in a bathtub, and fix with super glue.Only two uses later, it popped two more holes which I also patched. Next, I tried testing it indoors in a safer environment. It popped yet another hole after only about 3 minutes on an office chair.I am now using a Therm-a-rest camp seat cushion that is made to be tough enough to sit on a rock. While it is not as shock absorbent as this cushion was, it has lasted longer.If you do want the softest seat cushion, you would have to buy these in bulk."
2,Cushion has defect,It sprang a leak in the button area after 3 weeks of gentle use. Called company...they said to contact you.Barbara Johnsonbarbnbp@aol.com626 338 7895
2,Beware! Watch the cord!,"We received this item as a gift from our son for the holidays. Has worked decently for the past month, keeping the living room warm, but as noted with another customer, the electral cord just started to melt and has done damage to the electrical wall outlet. The cord was always a little warm when we unplugged it, but we just thought that was normal. Now that it has actually scortched the outlet and the plug itself has melted, I'm not planning on using it again.A little extra comfort is not worth burning the house down for."
4,Dimplex CS1205 electric stove,I just bought this a few days ago and i love it!! it warms up my entire 4 room apartment to a stable 65 degrees (running on high) my question is approx. how much a month does it cost to run this heater say 7 hours a day? anyone have any idea? Thanks
1,Bad product bad service,"I received this item cracked down the side and the shipping box was in tact so I'm inclined to believe it was shipped this way. Ace Hardware was difficult to reach, had to make several attempts just to get contact and several actual contacts to get the return set up.At the time, it was returned, I requested full refund as I had no confidence that a 2nd item would receive good service."
4,entertaining and poignant - 30 does not = expiration date!,"What this book isn't: 1) something you would take seriously. 2) something to consult if you are a selfhelp fan. 3) something you won't get if you never moved out of your parents' house.Turning 30 for me was a breeze; it was 31 that freaked me out. As a chronic bargainer (Chapter 3), experiencing the joys of our current economy (Chapter 7), I personally enjoyed this book. I think it's wry, witty, has a touch of Ab-Fab to it, and made me want to have a drink and read it in the tub.If you are closer in your level of seriousness to some of the reviewers here, don't buy this book. Otherwise, kick back and enjoy the read!"
3,"Fun, but not all 29 and counting chicks are single!","I enjoyed the fun tone of the book overall, but was a little surprised that Tilsner seems to think none of her readers are married and turning 30. I'm hitting the big 3-0 this year, and have been married for two years and have a baby (her Planet Parenthood book is fantastic, by the way!), so I felt almost left out at times. Overall, though, the book is a lot of fun--I'm passing it along to all my girlfriends!"
5,Release is INCREDIBLE,"This is absolutely one of the best CD's I have ever heard. The vocals of Smita and Jyoti combined gives an amazing feeling. The music is the perfect combination of western and east indian; it's unlike anything you've ever heard before. ""Two Cultures"" hits close to home, and it's something I can really relate to. This band will go far. Their recent performance at the UW Talent Show once again blew everyone away. The way the Shukla sisters get into their music onstage make me want to get up and dance along with the music. I love you guys!"
4,Surprisingly Good!!!,"My father gave this CD to me with an ""since you like spoken word, you'll like this"" approach. It took a couple of run-throughs for me to being really feeling this album. I was hooked at ""Say Yes"". It is refreshing to hear a new release from an ever-growing Neo-Soul genre that offers good, soulful beats with though-provoking lyrics. If you like the music check out the website where you can find out such facts like the duo was responsible for penning and producing Michael Jackson ""Butterflies"", which is also featured on this album. It's worth the time to listen."
4,worth a listen,"My ultimate favourite track is Say Yes. This song first introduced me to Floetry. From then on I have been hooked. This is a good album I wouldn't say it is their best however I still enjoy it.If you want the different soul, r'n'b and lean towards Neo Soul then this is for you."
4,Great Soul Album,This is a nice piece of music here great for relaxation. My favorite tracks are:Floetic-wonderfulMr.Messed Up- takes my breath away and i start to daydreamHeadache-simply just beautiful reminds me of London for some reason.Say YesMs.StressHelloGetting Late
4,More Songstress,"I do not want to break up the group or anything, but I am totally digging the songstress. At times, the album seems disjointed. I do like what they are attempting to do for that reason it is a good reason to get the album. Singing vocals are tight!!!"
3,Mainstream breaks,"No No No! this was a big mistake for DJ X to go mainstream on us.It has a few alright songs,but none really worth mentioning,I dont advise dance fans to buy this,get his club experience mixes instead or if you can find it,club 2000."
2,TP stands for Toy Planer,"Bought this on Amazon a couple of years ago for really cheap. If you are planing pine and soft woods it works okay and the snipe can somewhat be controled by adjusting the in and out feed. Problem. No power. Maple, oak, cherry, bring this thing to it's knees. Just not enough power and you dull the blades so fast on the hardwoods. about 1/3 of a turn at a time is all you can get. Saving my pennies for a better planer. Toy Planer for sale, anyone interested?"
4,tp305,A great planer/surfacer for the money. I wish that it had a better way to aim the shaving chute as it throws shavings all over the shop. Otherwise it is very useful and at the lowest price anywhere.
3,it's okay,"Parts aren't real durable if you plane a lot. Has some snipe, but generally does fine. Blades aren't cheap, so I sharpen them on a stone."
2,"Jeeze, is this really a Faye Kellerman book?","What a shame. It's just too awful. I can't believe this is Faye Kellerman's work. I've previousely enjoyed many or her novels. This one, Stone Kiss, is an endless volumne of senseless diatribe. Everything is repeated again and again. Got me. I'm half way through and have almost put it down three times. I'm going to brave it out because of loyalty to the dear lady. But shoot, I wonder if it's time for her to quit writing? I remember reading some of Agatha Christie's last works. Eee gads. They too, were filled with nonsense."
2,"""Riveting""???..............","Publisher's Weekly calls this book ""riveting."" I made it 3/4 of the way through the book and QUIT. I have read all of Ms. Kellerman's previous novels, and believe that her last 3 books have been downhill all the way. She is capable of very good writing, but in this book is overly prone to exclamation points and plot confusion. At one point she refers to hair as ""tresses""--ok, are we reading a romance novel here? Get real.I totally agree with the reviews of Jerry Bull and Carolyn Lawrence, above, especially regarding the plodding and confusing plot and the switches in point of view. When the point of view switched to Terry halfway through the book it made absolutely no sense at all, not to mention that Terry is an extremely annoying character. I found the relationships between Decker and his relatives and Decker and Donatti to be a complete stretch.I DID find the information about Jewish sects somewhat interesting.Sorry, Ms. Kellerman. I may not even read your next book."
1,What?,"I've enjoyed both Kellermans. Incorporating Jewish culture into the Decker books has always been a sweet spice; however, like a person who uses to much, the use of Jewish culture is overpowering the story.An additional problem in this book is that after about 4-5 pages you can't keep track of the players.Faye's books have begun to move into the area of political advocacy without the skills to do so effectively."
2,Disjointed,"I agree completely with Jerry Bull's review. In addition, the authoress introduces, or reintroduces, a character S. Gilbert who is found dead. I probably missed (or forgot) the first reference to this man but, in either event, the book was too dull and too caught up in Judaism to reread. I could care less!T. R. Reid"
5,Great multi-purpose bag!,"I bought this to store my daughter's LeapFrog toys. This case has two large zippered compartments, which makes it very versatile. It is also padded, which offers some protection from accidental drops. The side that is supposed to hold the DVD player fits her Leapster2 (with game cartridge inserted) and LeapPad1 side-by-side perfectly. The Velcro strap holds them in place, so they don't fall out when she unzips the case. The other side has a mesh pocket that holds her game cartridges, and there is room outside the mesh pocket for spare batteries and the AC adapter as well as slots for DVDs/CDs. There is also enough room in either of the compartments to put books and packs of crayons/markers. It makes a great bag for long road trips because everything goes into one place, and she can get to everything she wants on her own."
4,More than expected.,This is great. It comes with so many straps you can hang it anywhere. And as a bonus it protects the player while moving it around.
4,Good product,"This product is the one they have up at best buy. I wanted to show my wife I could save us money and get it here really fast. We did both. It could have been my truck but the straps that go around the driver and passenger head rest weren't really the best way to set it up. We ended up attaching it around the middle console vs around the driver and pass. seats. Works great good size for 9"" screen."
5,Yummy!,"For people that may be allergic to wheat/gluten or that may just like to try other kinds of crackers, these are a definite must try. These do not taste to ""ricey."" They are nice and crisp and not too salty. They go well with cheeses. You do have to be careful of some of the ""flavored"" varieties as they may have some corn or wheat in them, but the plain rice ones do not! Very Good!!!"
2,"Useless, Way Too Thin","These targets are way too thin so they are completely useless. The indoor range that I go to uses a single clamp that holds your targets on the top and in the center. So when you clamp your target and press the switch to reel it out into the spot you want to shoot, the target folds in half and stays that way. I do love the large size of the targets because they are the size of an actual person, but they are too thin to be of any use. I had to fold the top of the target several times, enough times to where the head of the target was gone and only the body was showing. This is the only way to thicken the target enough so it does not fold. If you go to an outdoor range then it may be even worse. If a strong gust of wind hits it, it may rip it off the clamp. I hope this review gives people good understanding of this product before they buy."
3,Very interesting theory about China's threat,"The book is very interesting and full of imagination. The authors try to convince readers that China's threat was attributed to Clinton-Gore adminstration. However, they forgot the development of Chinese military forces (PLA) was strengthened and enhanced since 1972. Kinssinger and Nixon initiated the relationship with China through Ford, Carter, Ragon, Bush, and Clinton. Since Ragon adminstration, mass millitary, high-technology and intelligence exchanges between China and USA resulted in the greater threat of Chinese millitary forces (PLA). So far, ""One China Policy"" which was proceeded by the many former US presidents has been totaly failure. This book only told the results, but did not tell you reasons. I recommand readers to read ""About Face: A history of America's curious relationship with China, from Nixon to Clinton"" written by James Mann, 1998 (Alfred A. Knopf Publisher, New York). You will understand the whole and true story and the facts."
5,Great Purchase!,"We purchased this book on the advice of other reviews on the site. It lived up to the praise. It does not ""teach you to draw,"" if that's what you're looking for. However, if you have the basics down, it really gives great ideas and advice on improving your drawing and making it more realistic. We have purchased two copies of this book now, one for each of two sons--both of them love it and have really improved their art with recommendations in this book."
4,Great little Cozy Mystery,"Ophelia Jensen is a small town librarian, hiding from a painful past in Summerset, Iowa. Ophelia's grandmother, Abby, is a warm hearted, nurturing woman who uses her psychic gifts and the healing arts learned in Appalachia in helpful ways.This books introduces the characters in a charming way. Ophelia is a witty heroine. Abby is a great support character and I hope she gets more page space in the next books."
2,"Entertaining, for a while","Arms of Nemesis is a generic murder mystery that happens to be set in ancient Rome. Saylor's descriptions of Roman habits and culture are interesting and some might even be accurate. They make the book amusing for a while. But after you realize they are there only for effect, you conclude that the plot and characters might just as well be in Pittsburgh. About half way through this book I couldn't help thinking I'd read it before, several times.If like a slightly different version of a standard potboiler, give it a try. If you want something unique, keep looking."
1,"Too ""out there""",The book presents some weird techniques to get someone to fall in love with you. It has to do with touching people in certain ways to trigger emotions.Her theory is that the touch brings about a positive so eventually the other person will relate you with the positive emotions. A little too out there for my tastes.
2,bias,"Lowndes is an impressive author. Pity she cannot be objective. For her it is not ok to go after someone significantly better looking than yourself. But it is ok to go after someone significantly richer than yourself. A typical chick bias.Men - better get advice from your brothers Clink, La Ruina or Valentine. They are more on your side.Her: ""Undercover Sex Signals"" are great though."
2,Good but turned Sour,"I downloaded this book off Kazaa (glad I didn't pay for it). It seemed fairly helpful until about halfway where it seems the Author was hurt by a man and feels the need to bash them and make exaggerations. She talked about how important it is to appeal to the opposite sex's ego but then bashes men. As if women are so perfect. These partisan, biased, and bigoted attitudes are not going to help anyone who really cares about making someone fall in love with them. I would never date anyone with these attitudes. Personally I think male bashing comes from women who feel inferior to men anyway. The only people I would recommend this book to are women with low self-esteem. For the rest I would recommend books that do not need to put down one gender, like ""Men are from Mars, Women Are From Venus."""
1,This book is trash and completely useless.,There is nothing of value in this book. Any tid- bits that may be worthwhile have been thoroughly covered in other books and are just a lot of common sense. The book focuses on the use of manipulation and doesn't even explain that effectively. It is written from the point of view of a beautiful princess who seems to have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth and is unable to relate to those of us who do not resemble movie stars or make three million plus a year.
2,Don't fall for it!,"If you buy this book -- as I did -- then you deserve the lesson that I learned. Some people just aren't going to fall in love with you, just as you aren't going to fall in love with everyone.If you learn that lesson and learn to be comfortable with it, you'll save yourself a lot of heartache. Don't try to make that one special person fall for you. That person may not really be all that you image him or her to be.However, some of the lessons in this book will make you a more lovable person, and will increase your chances of finding an attractive human to fall in love with you."
5,Communication Tool Kit,"This text breaks down the hunt into hunter and quarry, so if you like to read self help books that clearly state the game, the target and the weapon to use, this book may answer your needs. Written diversely to reach either sex, the tools are expanded to share examples, and outcomes... pretty good for an old book that teaches basic communication skills that can be used in all settings of interpersonal relationships of all kinds; intimate and business. Add this one Mr. Man or Ms. Woman to your Tool Box and you will wear it out."
3,ok i guess....,"this phone is a great accessorie and it's very fun when you first get it but when you have longer than a few weeks it starts to get boring but it's a great phone for kids.i have one. but i turned it off. it always have bad signals.it will turn off during your calls. but other than the bad signals and stuff it's a pretty neat phone.it has a color screen.it has 3 games which are tetris,brick attack, and doodlerz.if you want this phone i think you should change your mind now.get the audiovox camera phone that's blue and silver i have that phone now it's a great phone.and a great acessorie."
1,Give me a break,"What a smug and obtrusive book. Clearly, the author has done a ton of traveling, but the real story would seem to be the road killed left behind. The book could have been written in one sentence; Take advantage of everyone and leave no prisoners!!!"
2,Not great,"Tried using the tool with a big block of chocolate, but it didn't produce the long curls that we expected. As the blade was cutting, the chocolate just crumbled and didn't curl at all. Maybe I am not doing it correctly, but I wouldn't know because there isn't an instruction booklet. Regardless, the product seems very durable the the blade is sharp. If you are looking for a chocolate shaver to make curls for cake decorating, don't waste your money."
1,beware!,"Awaited, with great anticipation, the arrival of this book--especially to read the ""Simpleton and Sophisticate story. Was deeply disappointed to discover that two of the story's pages were blank in the edition that I'd rec'd. It seems that other pages are blank as well."
4,"McBain Satisfies, As Always!","This is early McBain, from 1972, and all the boys from the 87th precinct are here in top form! (Why can't I meet a guy like Steve Carella?!) Like all of his police procedurals, it's a very entertaining and breezy read. Suspense, humor, and crackling dialogue are all served up in equal doses. The book's jacket says, ""What could be easier? He had a confessed killer, clear fingerprints, and a witness. Everything was sewed-up tight. Or was it?"" Bad vibes and his keen cop's instinct sends Detective Carella on a mission to prove promiscuous Sadie wasn't killed by the number one suspect, but by somebody very close to her. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH MCBAIN! I've loved him for years -- and his books written under his real name -- Evan Hunter -- are also wonderful."
5,Excellent Sequel,"This book was terrific because it started when the 1st book left off. Also, it has Pie-Rat take control over Garzooka. Since that happened the other members had to really work hard to beat Pie-Rat's spell. I would recommend this book to people over 6 because it's easy to understand and its funny."
2,overly worshipful,"OK, the topic of the book is french cuisine. But Ms Trubek writes so simplistically worshipful that I think the book is not informative any more. She gives as a fact that until today french cuisine has been on top in every respect - and that's too narrow a view in the year 2000. The book should be displayed in every french cultural center and maybe in all the cooking schools mentioned which propagate french cooking - maybe that was the main motivation to write it anyway."
2,Not exactly what I expected,The product was not exactly what I expected but I guess it is ok for some people. My husband did not like it very much and still had a hard time with it.
4,Looks very good,I have been taking several courses at our technical college and have not had time to use this book yet. It looks like it will be very helpful but I do not know as yet.
3,They died.,"I bought them June 2009 for $51 shipped (ANTonline through AMAZON, no longer available from that vendor). They worked perfectly until 1 week ago, lasted 13 months. Now no sound from on speaker and only faint from the other. I'm not sure what happened and I haven't seen a similar problem in other reviews. They were outside, but well protected from the weather. The sound was great while they worked and the price I paid excellent. Now they are paper weights.Has anyone else had this problem?"
3,Meh,It was just okay. I didn't really CARE about the characters or the ending. Perhaps I have outgrown Zane?Literary Marie
5,"""Addicted"" Zane is back!",I truly enjoyed this read! I was a little apprehensive when it was suggested for our book club read. This book surpassed my expectations. Pick it up and you will not be able to put it down!
3,Not Zane's best,"Hot Box was funny and interesting in the beginning, but the end was boring. I feel like Zane had a really good idea and forgot to finish it or didn't have enough time. The ""twist"" wasn't surprising at all. I am a little disappointed. I hope she writes a better ending for the next book"
4,Only Zane!,"This book is about two friends, Milena and Lydia and their lives involving four men. The story is good and keeps u glued to what will happen next. Milena leads a dull life that heats up and Lydia would die for some excitement in the liitle town that they reside in."
4,GET THIS BOOK NOW!!,"This was a very good book. I am convinced the characters are REAL (I'm sure the names have been changed). This book was very interesting. The only part I did not like was Milena's occupation. Zane, this was an excellent book!! I was reading on my Kindle at home and reading it everywhere else on my cell phone's Kindle APP (shhhhhh!!; keep that part quiet). I could not put this one down. I can't wait for Zane's next book. Lydia was very ""colorful"". Yosef was interesting. OK, just read the book. It's very good."
1,Terrible idea - unfortunate,"This is a really boring game that uses the concept of race to sell itself, then offers an almost offensive lack of choices of career and uninteresting format. Big disappointment"
1,"The Complete Nutritional Supplements Buyer's Guide by Deepak Chopra, Daniel Gastelu and Jonathan Zuess (Jun 27, 2000)","Compared to the other similar books in this category, I was a bit disappointed. Did not think it was well written, and much less informative then I had anticipated."
4,An oldie,"I saw this movie at U Mass in the early 1970's, liked it and when VCR's came out I tried to buy it, could not find it anywhere. Did not know it had been removed 'for the safety of the nation'. Civil unrest issue and all that. Movie is okay, nothing fantastic but it does show the feelings of that era."
4,The Special Educator's Survival Guide,This book is excellent. It really defines the role and job of a special education teacher. In fact my principal was so impressed with it that he ordered it for all the special education teachers in my building. Another principal also ordered it for her special education teachers.
1,The bars had mold on them,"I had ordered two boxes of the the NuGo Smarte Carb Bar, the first box was good as always, but the second box the bars had mold on them."
2,Flattened Smarte Carb bars,"I bought these because I had tried them before and liked them. The bars in this batch of two boxes arrived at about half the height of the first batch. Note this was the bars, not the boxes. It was like someone sat on the box and squished the bars flat. They are still tasty, but the squishing remove any crunchy character from the ""stuff"" between the chocolate and the peanut butter. Not pleasant!"
3,disappointed in the last box I recd,"I have ordered several boxes of these at different times all thru Amazon, Taste was good and the 20 grams of protein made it easy to meet my per diem goal. The last box however tasted and looked old, the way old chocolate does. The expiration date was 2012 so I can only assume it was from the way they were stored. I had good luck with the first 3 or 4 boxes, so I might try again."
4,Good Spiritual Look at Infertility,"I was looking for a book to help other women going through infertility. I went through infertility years ago. I like this book for it's Christian spiritual look at how to deal with Christianity and Jennifer Saake shares her own story, which helps you know you're not alone in this. She really tells it like it was for her. It was lacking in that it didn't include any practical information about the different kinds of treatments."
5,"Fantastic and so ""real""","I bought this book as I am still in the depths of IF despair. My heart is just broken, I am having a hard time with all of the emotions and just can't face the reality of where I am in my life. This book has helped me gain perspective and to realize all of the ways I have been blessed, even through my pain and doubt. I highly recommend this book for any woman facing the horrible challenge of infertility and/or loss."
5,Exactly what I needed,"This book expressed what I found hard to do myself about infertility. She admited things I didnt admit, and showed Biblically how to deal with the heart break and gave amazing insight and strength to my own personal struggle with infertility. She and her book have been a true blessing and any woman experiencing infertility, adoption loss or child loss NEEDS to read this book, it DOES help more than you can immagine."
2,A little too simplistic,"This book has a bit of a Pagan/Wiccan flavour, and it addresses astrological associations of crystals as well. I think this is one that may be skipped over for a much more comprehensive book."
3,"Good, worth getting",This is better than I thought it would be and it has some really godd cuts on it. Still - Almond has done some fine solo work and Ball's stuff with The Grid was even better. Okay for fans.
5,Brewer Does It Again,"Gaylord Brewer's ""Let Me Explain"" is his finest work of poetry since ""Devilfish,"" one of the best reads of the last ten years. In this one, Brewer finds his stroke by writing one apologia after another on a creative range of subjects and to a variety of people. We see the world through Brewer's dark yet sweet lense, whether it is buying melons, being inflicted with stigmata, or grading papers. If you like Carver, Hugo, and crew, you will love the clarity and beauty of the writing here. Iris Press has also done a lovely job with the production of the book. The cover, a wistful razorback hog gazing into the uncertitude, says it all."
2,"Poor Del' ,,,save the children",Cauld have been a lot better it is almost sad to whatch del the funky go down in such flames but none the less a must have for any Hiero fan!!
3,Let's be cold-hearted,"The song ""Let's Get It Started"" is a considerable improvement over it's highly non-PC predecessor ""Let's Get Retarded."" Ostensibly they figured out their mistake after the first thousand people complained. But hey, now they can make even more money by selling a single that doesn't offend the mentally challenged."
3,Redmond RealSalt is Real Gritty,"'Been buying Redmond RealSalt Sea Salt in 26oz bag about 4 years and loved it, but noticed grittiness in last and current bag. The grit is in everything; homemade bread, sweets, tea, and marinaded meat! Because it does not melt, we assume it is sand. 'Sending a letter and last bag of salt to the company so they can comment on what they find - hope they are honest about it.- Lady K"
2,a lenses for ?,I have a JVC Everio and I bet this kit won't fit ...but I wouldn't know because the MM size is not listed ...how do you market conversion lenses without a MM size ...only if you are drag fishing for business ...
5,Good story,"This continues the good stories that are well known in the early Baker years. His companionship with Sarah, one of the best Doctor/Companion pair ups of the entire series. The location and set designs, music and villians are all well done. Sutek makes a chilling villian, and the characters are all well acted. Classic scenes are infact the Tardis' voyage to 1980 earth to show Sarah what would become if Sutek were allowed to go free. Also the Mars pyramids and its many puzzles I found to be intriguing. The only flaw I found in this story is the organ playing in the beginning. Someone should delete this on the DVD release. We all know that is why Sutek sent his servant to kill the egyption in the first place. This is a classic Doctor Who story."
5,Professor Scarman Steals the Show,"I didn't see this mentioned in any of the other reviews and I wanted to share it. I thought Professor Scarman was awesome as a villain, even moreso than Sutekh. The mummys were a bit silly looking but I would have been more scared of Prof. Scarman than those 3 mummys put together."
1,Pyramids Of Mars - Snorer,"I am a big Dr. Who fan as I've been following Tom Baker since 1980. I started following him while stationed at the Learmonth Solar Observatory in Learmonth Australia from 1972-1982. To me, this episode really put me to sleep (literally). Sure it had the cheesey plots and cheap set designs but the story was too filled with technical jargaon that I found hard to follow. I really like Tom Baker and salute him for a ""good try"" in this one, but I'll simply file this one away with my other Dr. Who DVDs and mayb e look at it again some other time. Some people might like this episode but I believe it could of been better!"
5,"Her voice is oh, so effective","Terry Robb's understated production keeps Wilcoxon's quiet presence and wonderful instrumentation at the forefront. Her voice is oh so effective, whether interpreting ""John the Revelator"" or the more contempory ""Testoserone Poisoning."""
3,"Great Sound When Loud, But...","The speaker set is really easy to connect. Just plug it in the USB port. the computer automatically detects it and uses it. The speaker sound great, thanks to two drivers per side design. The base is full (relatively speaking, of course), and the high frequencies are crispy.However, there is one particularity that I am trying to figure out. When I turn the volume low, the speaker suddenly cuts off. No matter how I turn the volume lower, be it though the wheel behind the speakers, or the control on the computer, it always does that. It even cuts off when the signal is low. That is really weird. I don't know if this is because my computer setting is wrong (not likely since other speakers do fine), or this unit I have is bad, or its the design flaw. I hope someone can tell me."
2,A Toy - not a Practice Pad.,"It's small, there are no foot paddle inputs, there are limitations to the preprogrammed settings, there's no MIDI output. The sounds are fine, but not spectacular. My eight year old cousin thinks it's GREAT; I think it's substandard. Fine for kids or screwing around; lousy for actual music making."
4,One of the greatest with Martin.,"Ok, first of all we can't make a comparation between the ""Ozzy era"" and the other singers periods because the music and mentality of both are not the same, they are like two different bands.If we want to compare this album to any other, it would be the TYR album, because both are very similar in many aspects, and have Tony Martin as singer.HEADLESS CROSS is good, but TYR is a lot better in music and lirics, These are the best two best albums with Martin. FORBIDDEN and CROSS PURPOSES suck!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not like other Black Sabbath...,This is not like any other Black Sabbath I have heard In the past.I like this alot better than anything else and Tony Martin can't sing?! What the h**** is that all about?!I wonder If you have hearing problems or some other dissorder?!This Is the kind of album I can listen to over and over again without being bored.And you guys who compare this album to other Black Sabbath records are way out of line.This is one of a kind....
1,HEADLESS BAND,"No matter how Iommi tried, he destroyed SABBATH forever insisting in this horrible albuns, changing line-ups all the time, making a joke of SABBATH. He ceded under the pressure from the recording companies to continue using SABBATH's name, instead of creating a new band or a solo project. He even hired this singer ( Tony Martin ) who tries desperately to sound like Dio. THis is a totally forgetable album by ... this band , which is not, I repeat, IT'S NOT, BLACK SABBATH."
2,"Nice Ideas, but No Focus or Foundation","I cannot recommend this book. He puts forth some interesting ideas, but it is all conjecture. There is no scientific or historical foundation. It's all ""could be"", and ""might be"", and ""may be"", which becomes very frustrating. It also lacks focus. It drifts from topic to topic without a coherent driving thesis. Save your time and money."
4,Need a better editor,"This was a good book with great advice and touching stories. It really did help me feel more in touch with myself; however, the editor did a terrible job. It comes off at times as unintelligent with simple grammar mistakes, etc. As a linguist, I find this extremely perturbing. All of a sudden you have to go back and reread a sentence 3 or 4 times before you realize what it means. It's a shame because it makes Bonheim, an extremely wise and intelligent woman, look uneducated. If you can get by the editing, this book does have some great stories from women of all different backgrounds. I would really love to see a new edition of it because it's something long overdue. Women everywhere will relate to it and enjoy it."
1,Not Remotely about Astrology,"This book actually describes a system of seasonal meditations that will make your life better somehow. She has taken Mr. Graves' ""White Goddess"" and Mrs. Paterson's ""Celtic Lunar Zodiac"" and turned it into a spiritual system. The problem with this is that she strictly adheres to Mr.Graves' 365 day year, so her seasons will migrate backwards a day every three years or so until they are completely reversed. Her history is also off as well: the Celts practised aspects of Buddhism, Taoism and yoga before the Indians and Chinese did (pp. 17 and 213), and could teleport to Atlantis (page 199)."
3,Uneven,"Much preferred Amis' essays and commentary to his fiction. Not ready to pursue more of his stuff just yet, but eventually."
1,Disappointing!,I bought 2 pairs for my girls for Christmas. Both pairs broke (the ankle strap will not tighten) after being worn 2 or 3 times.
3,Good basic skates,The skates adjust fairly well. They don't need to be better. Our daughter is still only a beginner so faster is not better.
3,Roller skate,"These are pretty average quality, my 5 yr old has had these for almost one year and they are showing major signs of wear and tear already. Definitely not the most sturdy of roller skates."
5,GIRLS ADJUSTABLE QUAD SKATES,"These are great and were received with such joy and excitment, she wanted to sleep with them on.I really like the way they are made, her ankel has good support and her feet have room to grown."
4,Love Them!,"My 5 year-old daughter absolutely loves these skates. They give her a lot of stability. They are very easy to adjust. She just slips them on and off she goes! I think that she will be using these skates for years to come...they are very durable. Also, she loves the pink color!"
1,Great if you don't want your child to move around much!,"I just bought these skates for my 6 year old daughter. She was so excited to have ""big girl"" skates. We put them on and everything seemed great. The adjustment button functioned properly and the straps were great. Then she started to try to skate. She pushed off and went about 4 inches. The wheels barely turn. So i took them off her and tried to adjust the nuts holding the wheels on thinking they were too tight and binding the wheels. They weren't. I took a couple of the wheels off completely, held the center spindle and spun the wheel. It turned 1/2 turn and stopped. I thought maybe they needed to be greased a little so i put a little Tri-Flow on the bearings. It didn't make any difference. They are going back to Amazon today and taking my daughter to a local sports store to find her some real skates that really skate."
4,An Enlightening Read,"I was given a copy of this book by Meng sifu over a year ago and read it that very night. Though not a member of the Moy Yat or even Yip Man Wing Chun families, it was interesting and enjoyable to learn about just some of what they have done over the decades. Beyond a simple write up on background or description of movements, the book seemed intent on trying to share with the reader the greater experience of the Moy Yat family and that, I found, made it valuable to outsiders and insiders both (especially coming from a very different - small group, small family - background myself). People will seldom agree about every little thing, and I'd suggest that's even more reason to learn about each other. In any event, it takes courage and committment to put yourself and your family out there, and for that, the author deserves our respect and thanks."
2,Flowers From Berlin,"Parts were interesting ,but really was disjointed and dragged on way to long. wanted to enjoy it but got very bored about three quarters of the way through the book.The historical aspect is very shallow and not close to accurate."
5,Great read,An excellent book whis thought provoking and is well written and makes you think about the hardship experience in those times of occupation
2,eh...,"helped my service a little... still dropped calls though. worth the $5 I paid for it, but definately not $20."
2,Nikon NiMH Rechargeable Batteries did not last,"I bought Nikon NiMH Rechargeable Batteries with the charger [...]. The first and second recharge lasted long time. However, after 3rd recharge, one of the two batteries went dead - unable to recharge any more. Bad quality."
4,NiMH Rechargeable Batteries,When new they last a long time in the camera even while using the flash. They don't stay new for long.
4,Schubert played in Romantic style,"Barenboim gives very romantic account of 8 impromtus, played more like Liszt or Chopin with felxible tempi and beautiful tonal shading. G/b major impromto is played very slowly and sensitively."
4,Good realistic fiction,"Hannah is the middle child -- sandwiched in between a popular older sister and a spoiled and pretty younger sister. Her parents are divorced, and she is dealing with the new relationships her parents are forming. Throughout the book Hannah begins to realize that she isn't so ordinary after all, and that she is special too. Although this book deals with some serious issues, the tone is humorous and kids will relate to Hannah."
2,Shortcomings,"People need to be aware that this clock has an internal battery that is not useraccessible. To fix it, you have to send it back to the company for repair. We had about 25 employees and I can imagine the problem going without a clock for 4-5 days with 125 employees. Or you can buy a reconditioned clock and they will give you credit for the bad clock when they receive it. Also, my clock must have been in Office Max's warehouse for over two years according to AcroPrint's records. We had this clock less than 10 months and in service less than 8 months when it malfunctioned."
1,Don't use on the Sprint IP 830W by Samsung,"When I tried using the USB cable to sync to my laptop, an error message popped up right away saying something like ""USB port exceeded maximum voltage"". When I used the car charger... it zapped my cell function after about 45 minutes of charging. Everything else worked, just couldn't make calls! Was out of town on business at the time and ended up having to purchase another Sprint phone so my customer could reach me!"
1,Same book I already had,"I didn't know that this was the same book I already had, but the author decided to fancy it up with a new and improved hardback cover..."
5,Best Christmas Music,I had this CD when it first came out. However somehow lost the CD and only had case. Very mad when Holidays were coming I had no CD. Amazon was the only place I could find a replacement...The BEST Holiday songs....
3,Taking a 'middle of the road' view,"Regarding the two reviews already posted, I'm taking a middle of the road view. This book was not quite as helpful as I thought it would be but I'm glad I have it for future reference. It is a difficult read, and the authors do not provide much in the way of discussion for the techniques they present. It is left to the reader to decide if the technique is one that would be useful and appropriate. On that basis, I don't see how it could be used as a textbook [lack of guidance]. As a graduate student, I can appreciate the importance of the information presented, and consider this book more of a reference item."
5,Melitta Java Perk rocks!,My husband and I like really HOT coffee. What's so good about this particular brand is that it perks fast and HOT. We fill the pot @ night. In the morning we plug it in and we have HOT coffee within 5-10 minutes.The only drawback is that the pot should be larger and the perk top should be glass not plastic. Ours wore out after only a few months use. We contacted Melitta and they mailed us a brand new lid w/top at no charge.I would recommend this to anyone who has a very busy schedule and like/loves HOT HOT coffee!
3,It lasted about a year..,We've owned this coffee maker for about a year. About 2 months ago we noticed that the coffee was not as hot as usual. The problem has gotten progressively worse and now it will only brew a luke warm cup of coffee. We were very happy with this coffee maker until now. We will replace it with another brand.
2,Fatal Flaw,"I would like to echo the sentiments of the other reviewers. This pot is excellent, except for the plastic top. The lid is extremely tight and requires using the platic handle to remove it. Problem is, it just isn't sturdy enough. Very disappointing. After reading the other reviews, I've decided not to order a replacement part and chalk this up as a bad purchase."
2,Great Coffee Until The Bulb Breaks,"Allow me to be the 30th person to say that the lid is terrible. My bulb (the plastic thing on top) finally broke after a year, and about 10 hours of searching later, I still can't find a replacement. The coffee was great, but not good enough to make up for the crappy lid."
1,Disapointed,"We loved this pot when we bought it. The design, the taste and temperature of the coffee; but like everyone else our joy was short lived. The cheap plastic top snapped off after 3 months. I have not contacted the company, but I will be doing so shortly. I wish I had read these reviews before I went shopping."
2,Melitta Java Perk Stainless,"this is just the neatest design i've seen in years. love the taste of percolator coffee. i purchased one and filled it up with water then flooded my counter top, tried again, same problem. returned to target for a replacement. used about 2 weeks before the PLASTIC perc bubble broke. once again without coffee. melita offered to replace it sometime soon, but i was without coffee and too many people with same problem according to reviews. what happened to glass to withstand time and make this product more enjoyable. i have returned again for another brand. sorry melitta, you can do better."
1,Mount Vesuvious,"Put on the coffee, went out for a newspaper and came back to find the pot had cracked the cheap plastic top and was spewing coffee to the ceiling like Mt. Vesuvious. The top is now jammed into the lid and held in place with duct tape. Went to Macy's, Target and Ace. No replacement tops. Designer of pot should have to stand naked under it with legs spread. Why not a glass top?"
1,it lsted one month!,I got a nice coffee pot for Christmas.. a month later.. the plastic top broke and I am without a coffee pot...only way to open the top was by using the plastic top for leverage to open the lid...guess what it broke with in a month...surely these folks and address this issue...u buy something and u get get junk I guess.
4,Good basic primer for beginners,"I found this book to be a good primer for new real estate investors. Seasoned pros could find a nugget or two as well. More than anything else, DeCima's writing style, folksy as it is, is just fun to read. A good addition to your real estate library."
1,Bad product... stopped working in a month.,The thing sucks.. it has no power switch. You have to unplug the 11 pin power plug that is very delicate to power it off.. if not then it keeps spinning your HD and gets very hot. plus it stopped working after a month. Do not buy..
1,I rate this product a NEGATIVE 5 stars,"Wow, I should have read the review first...like everyone. But the box makes it sound so simple. I cannot even begin to list my complaints about it but I will say that I only bought it to redesign my fireplace. The box shows fireplaces but I couldn't figure out how to insert one. And getting the little man into the room was like playing an impossible video game with the energizer bunny on speed. Ridiculous. But I will return this product for a refund. What junk!"
5,A great collection of Christian music,"I bought these CDs to listen to at work and I love the variety of music. There are two discs: Blue (disc one) has Adult Contemporary and Worship songs on it. Pink (disc two) has Pop and Rock songs on it. I can listen to either CD depending on my mood and I love the variety of songs, its a great introcuction for anyone not too familliar with Christian music!"
3,Losing touch with the Gospel,"The music on this CD is good and well presented. The first CD has some of the ""change your heart and soul"" gospel music we have come to search for. The rest rest seems to be becoming commercial; excellent music but focussed on rhyming lyrics that have a basic God theme but lack the power of the truth. I hope the is not a trend. One of the best CD's this group put out was CD #1 from the WOW HITS 2006."
3,A great gift,got this as a gift for my father he enjoyed it but once you see his stuff alot is the same..but i got it quickly it was in great condition this seller is a great seller
5,Good fun,"Jeff's stuff is always fun to watch and laugh with, he has a great way to kid about real life that makes you laugh and think."
5,very funny,Very funny video. Jeff and the gang do it again. I was looking forward to the new characters but the new ones on the video aren't really new. Jeff used them years ago. But it was still worth the money and just as hilarious as ever.
2,not his best,"His recent divorce has affected the quality of this video. He did add a new character, but that didn't save the video."
4,Not for kids,I own all of his previous DVD's. I was disappointed with all of the language in this one. I thought that i could watch this with my family but with in the first 5 minutes that proved to be wrong. other then the language i really like the show.
1,Won't play,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and it would not play in our Blu-Ray player. Called Amazon and they were nice enough to send us a new copy in case it was defective, second copy also won't play. We did an update for our Blu-Ray player and yet still will not play. Very disappointed, blu-ray player is only a year old and plays all other blu-rays but this one...why is that??"
5,Review of Jeff Dunham's Controlled Chaos,"Great item! Suggested for those who love to laugh! Jeff is great in this one and Peanut, Walter and Achmed are too!"
5,omg great,thank you so much it made me laugh so hard i cried Jeff Dunham you rock my world and thank you
5,Good time laugh,"Another great one from Jeff Dunham and his ""family"" Controlled Chaos is a laugh a minute. We love the new ""AJ"" character. I am glad to see him making new characters that go well with the old ones as well. Happy to spend my hard earned money on a Jeff Dunham DVD."
4,Controlled Chaos,"Controlled Chaos is Jeff Dunham's most recent show and it's hysterical! Just wish it was longer. You have the option of watching it censored or uncensored as it does contain some f-bombs. Very funny stuff from Walter, Achmed and Peanut. Jose' is on here, too, but he's not a favorite of mine at all. This dvd is a must have, especially if you're already a fan. The price is right plus w/ free shipping, it's a no brainer. Loved it!"
5,Controlled chaos,WOW funny as all hell XD i died laghing through all of it!!!! achmedmobile is awesome i realy want to drive it XD... 5 stars ALL THE WAY!!!!
3,Let down,"I love Jeff Dunham. Up till now he's been one of my favorite comedians, but this most resent release was a bit of a let down. I didn't find it nearly as funny as his other stuff, although it had moments of glory, it's not my favorite one."
2,Jeff Dunham disappointed,"We have several of Jeff Dunham's tapes and they are hilarious. This one was more blue (more foul language) than before, and far too many racist overtones for your liking. It simply wasn't very funny. Wish I had saved my money instead."
2,Jeff Dunham Controlled Chaos,This one is not as good as previous dvd's. New characters were interesting.I would still buy the next one. Like his style.
3,Amazing American ventriloquist !,"It is a very amazing and funny video that i have ever seen. He,Jeff Dunham, is a very great American ventriloquist.He can quickly swift his voice and words. That's amazing ! Everyone should try it ! You must love as i do"
3,Not one of his best...,"We have all his other dvds and this one is short of the mark. A little bitter, a little off, not Dunhams best showing. A couple of funny parts but nothing worth raving about."
2,Not up to his previous shows,My wife and I were looking forward to this special. We did not even watch the whole show. The humor was so much darker than Jeff's other shows. Just not our cup of tea. Hopefully he will go back to what made him so funny to begin with.
1,Not the same charger,This was not the charger that they had advertised on their page. It was only a few dollars so it wasn't worth my time or effort to return it. They should have advertised it correctly in the first place.
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping for something a little easier to go through. I find this is more of a reference text than I was looking for.
4,Old radio show atmosphere,"Boucher, faithful to the atmosphere of Conan Doyle's books, invented radio plays from cases that Watson only vaguely refers to in his stories. He uses Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce for the dynamic duo. The only problem is the commercial breaks, even if they also enhance the old radio atmosphere!"
3,WISH I HAD BOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE.........,"I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING SOME NEW ARRANGEMENTS OF TRADITIONAL CHRISTMAS MUSIC OR EVEN THE OLD STANDARD ARRANGEMENTS, BUT THISIS MAILY PIANO AND GUTIAR AND I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THAT TYPE OF CHRISTMAS MUSIC. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE THIS TYPE OF MUSIC IT IS A GOOD CD TO HAVE."
5,High-quality instrumental versions of favorite Christmas tunes.,Bought this CD to add more variety to our Christmastime background music this year. It was a joy to listen to.
3,Good story,Would have rated this book higher but editing and proofreading were atrocious. Story was well thought out and ended in a believable manner.
2,Remediation - yeah? Where?,Not happy with this purchase at all! Yes it lists symptoms of possible mold exposure but there is very little advice about what to do about it! The title also mentions removing mold toxins from sick bodies - the book recommends one medication available by prescription that has many side affects associated with it. That's it! The only thing I got out of this book was that you need to bring in the experts if you think you have a mold problem and make sure they have the right equipment and qualifications for dealing with mold.
1,Uninformitive,Very disapointing. People suffering from health problems related to mold want help. This book did not offer any!
5,A Mom who needs help - this book has it.,"As a Mom of two very bright, high energy sons... I found it extremely helpful to have new suggestions for dealing with various situations and behaviors. Excellent book!"
5,Brilliant writer!,"Tatiana Tolstaya writes brilliantly. Her shorts stories are full of wit, irony and talent. This book is a good proof of it. There are several essays I loved in this book most, such as ""Ryazhenye"" and ""Krutye Gorki"".I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't discovered this author yet. Just one more detail: Tatiana Tolstaya comes from a great literary dynasty - she is Aleksey N. Tolstoy's granddaughter and Leo Tolstoy's great-grandniece. This shows..."
5,The Philosophy of HIstory,This is not a book about history - this is a book about the philosophy of history.Francis Parker Yokey sees history through the lens of determinism; determinism rooted in gentic predestination.The forces driving history are predetermined and behave like living organisms. His most important observation is that civilizations (like living organisms) have a natural lifespan. Western Civilization is at the end of its lifespan.Francis Parker Yockey spent his early years as a Prosecuting Attorney at the post WW2 Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. He does not deal with any program or ideology about how we should act to change the future - but his detractors treat him as though he did. He was murdered in prison by the authorities in 1960.Imperium is one of the deepest and most perceptive books ever written.
5,"Thank You !! AGAIN, Are You Being Served?","MY COLLECTION OF ARE YOU BEING SERVED IS NOW COMPLETE, AND I ENJOYED EVERY EPISODE, AND I ONLY WISH THAT MORE EPISODES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE, I THOUGHT THEIR WAS MORE ROOM FOR MORE EPISODES.I'M SURE THAT MORE SITUTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE EPISODES....AND THE EXCUSE THAT THEIR WAS NO LONGER ""PECKING ORDER"" AMONG THE STAFF WAS A LAME EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING MORE EPISODES. AND THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT BEING ON, WELL WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PROMOTING??THEY (BBC AND THE PRODUCERS) SHOULD OFFER THE ARE YOU BEING SERVED? FANS AT LEAST ONE FINAL MOVIE TO BRING BACK ALL THE REMAINING CAST FROM THE ORIGINAL (MR. LUCAS AND MR SPOONER) AND GRACE AND FAVOUR, TOGETHER FOR A FINAL GOOD BYE, BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT (I DON'T LIKE TO SAY IT BUT...) THE CAST WON'T BE AROUND FOREVER, BUT THEY SHOULD DO SOMETHING NOW WHILE THEY CAN !!!!!! THANK YOU AGAIN....ARE YOU BEING SERVED FOR ALL THE ENJOYMENT THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO ME AND MY FAMILY !!!!!"
5,Are You Being Served Again Series Review,"British comedies have been my personal all time favorites for many years now. If you love Are You Being Served you will really love Are You Being Served Again. The quality of the DVD is excellent and does show every episode plus some extra features. Owing this DVD means anytime I am in the mood I just have to pop it into the machine and sit back, relax and enjoy great comedy. This product was sent quickly and in perfect condition."
1,where are the handles,"I don't know what genius it was that decided measuring cups no longer needed to have a connected handle. These half handles are extremely hard for someone to hold onto when the cup is wet. I wish I could find one of the old cups, that had a full handle!!"
4,very complete and easy to read,"Medical books and journals are well know to be boring,hard to read and very technically written. As a patient,I found this medical book easy to read and understand.It paints a very complete picture of this complex disease...and the pictures will keep you very much awake whilereading."
4,"Star Wars fans must read, simply as good as it gets.","I feel that if you have seen the movies and can't wait for the next Trilogy then you have to revert to reading some books. Well these are about as close as you are going to get to the original characters and action without actually watching the movies. Good story, clever settings. The only complaint would have to be the ending, but it's still ok. - J.A.S."
4,Okay.,"Although good, and one of the first ever to be written, Dark Force Rising lacks realism. Timothy Zahn, I have found tends to make all of the main characters look wussie. A real imperial commander (not wimpo Thrawn) wouldn't have put up with C'Baoth at all, but shot him at the first disobeying of his orders. Like I said, lacks realism."
4,Star Wars: Dark Force Rising,It is basically a short review of the great book written by Zahn. I recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times.
3,The editor apparently never showed up.,"Ellen Page was not the appropriate actress to play the main character, Bliss. (Page does not seem the best choice to play either a beauty pageant contender or a roller derby queen, let alone both.) But the rest of the movie is so well cast that Page's dry wit would have allowed one to overlook the square-peg-in-a-round-hole problem with this casting.But the main problem with this movie is that the screenplay just meanders, causing the energy to flag. And in a movie about a roller derby queen the worst sin is allowing the energy to flag. A good editor could have easily pushed this movie up into four star territory. Unfortunately, Barrymore's directorial debut suggests that she should stay in front of the camera. This movie gets a third star simply on the basis of a strong supporting cast. (Daniel Stern as a redneck? But he pulls it off!)"
2,It just kept on missing the mark,"A great concept, great actors, good music. But just killed by it's vanilla (Hollywood) interpretation of the young women seeking to escape the suburbs, seeking to be independent plot line."
5,Fun at seventeen,"This was such a fun movie. My husband and I watched it last night after it was delivered. It's one of those movies that start with the main character-Bliss--hating her life til she stumbles on RD. It takes some sneeking around and mistakes along the way, but she perseveres til her whole family is mostly on her side and proud of her--especially Dad--he finally was able to put a staked picture of Babe Ruthless as a TXRD (yes, I'm originally from TX). Marsha Gaye Harden was the essentially pushy pagent Mom who sort of came around in the end. This was definitely a feel good movie even though they didn't win the title match. I'll watch it many times. Deb"
4,Good flick,"I love this movie, not perfect, but good!Check it out. Its a drama, not a comedy. I don't like the weird ugly boyfriend dude in the movie. I like the rest of it though."
4,Whip It DVD,"We were very happy with the dvd though delivery was a little slow. Since my husband plays an extra in the movie, we thought the quality was wonderful and would do business with them for sure."
4,"Strangely involving, unnecesarily weird","After the first 50 pages, the books suddenly draws you in. Helen is in search of her husband, so she can put an end to a dead marriage. Following his steps, she becomes teh center of a strange mystery, sought after by weird characters whose interst in her is never quite explained.The novel is a page-turner. The descriptions of European cities is detailed and alive. However, a lot of circumstances remain unclear. The reader is left with a lot of whys and how comes. Yet, that said, the novel is so unique that is worth the read."
3,Helen as Alice in Wonderland,"This book defies conventionality and is unlike anything that I have read except ""Alice in Wonderland"". That makes it difficult to review. Helen is on a journey not only to find herself, but find her missing husband. The cast of characters that she encounters are not only entertaining, but pieces to the puzzle of a murder. I found myself bored at times and intensely interested at others. I enjoyed the ways in which this book was different, including the drawings and lithographs that were on every 10 pages or so. This is definitely a different type of read, and for that alone I liked it."
4,Band of Brothers,"DVD's were in great shape but the box showed a little wear although that's not what is/was important. We're looking forward to watching the whole series, thank you!"
5,Very Satisfied!,This item was a gift and was shipped to the gift-recipient in record time. Perfect in every regard.
2,Pretty standard and boring.,"This miniseries was pretty boring. Stay away, unless you love to suffer."
5,Great!,"This product arrived in a timely matter and in excellent condition. This is an amazing mini-series, and I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you!"
5,Great!!,Item was shipped super fast and are in great shape! Everything looks new and I have really enjoyed all the DVD's. Great buy!
5,Hey GI Joe,"Let's rewrite history for your benefit!What would you suggest?I suppose ""Patton"" is more realistic?Some people need to get a life."
5,This film makes you a part of it.,"You want a lump in your throught at times,maby some goose bumps,and tears.You will get to know some real Americans,who did their duty.A few of them are still alive.I can only say thank you to the ones that gave all of their future,so we could have today."
5,Amazing Series...,"If you wish to see some true WWII heroes in action, Band of Brothers is a wonderful place to begin."
5,Easy...Quick....Cheap,"I looked online, went to Amazon, found a Great price, & purchased.....A week later this DVD was in my mail box....Quick, Easy, Cheap....Thanks"
5,Best movie.. miniseries.. whatever!,"This has got to be the best thing to ever come out. I loved this series and never wanted it to end!! It got me back into WW2 and now I've come back to my WW2 buff days:P. I don't even think you need to like WW2 to like this series, because the story (TRUE story) illustrates courage and valor of the men of easy company. Makes you respect the real people who fought the war, like Richard Winters, Carwood Lipton, and all the other men who gave their lives up for our country."
5,Great history and entertainment.,Extremely well done. Especially like the interviews with the actual members of Easy Company. Makes me think of my dad.
1,Once again mighty Americans are jogging through frontlines,"If you ejoyed classical American propaganda (like ""Saving Private Ryan"") , you won't be dissapoited with this trash. To me this is bad comedy with same ridicolous scenes. For example I watched an episode about german siege of Bastogne. And what did I saw !?! At the end of the episode American just casualy running through while Germans doing nothing to stop him. No Mr. Tom Hanks and your merry men, I wasn't convinced that such actions chrushed Third Reich."
2,Missing disk #2,"Hello,We love the Band of Brothers Series, however, we received 2 disks #3 instead of a disk #2. Can this be corrected?"
3,"Great movie, not great blu-ray","The BOB series is incredible. Excellent from start to finish. However, the blu-ray transfer is not as great as one would expect. The DVD version I have, when upconverted, looks exactly the same as the blu-ray to me. Not worth buying another copy if you already own the DVD version IMO.This should have been a 5 star review but I am subtracting 2 stars for the fact that the DVD looks the same as the blu-ray."
5,Band of Brothers (Blu-ray),"This is a great mini-series. I have the original and now the Blu Ray version. The Blu Ray enhances what is already a great DVD set. The picture and the audio are a lot clearer and much more crisp. Also, this was by far the best price on the market. If you are a fan of Blu Ray then this DVD series is a must for your collection."
5,Band of Brothers,I loved this piece of art. It is truly a masterpiece. The actors that played these real life heros did an excellent job of showing the hardships that the Easy Company had. You can tell that they were a unit as actors. They wanted to tell the story of the heros of WWII and they did so with such a vigor and intelligence. I loved this story and I felt for those men as one by one they lost someone close to them or they themselves were lost.
5,Band of Brothers,I will make this quick and to the point. This is they best movie I have ever seen. The only bad part was that it had to end.
5,"Excellent story-telling, riveting to watch","I never enjoyed ""war"" movies and wasn't looking forward to sitting down to watch this miniseries, but my husband really wanted me to see it after watching it himself. I was surprised at how amazing and interesting this story is, and I am humbled to witness the integrity of these men, their fear, how many of them were able to put aside this fear and persevere in the worst conditions. Their conviction is truly admirable.The action scenes are exciting, and I find myself watching this miniseries, or parts of it, over and over.Highly recommended."
5,A Must Own Blu Ray,"Looks utterly Fantasic on Blu Ray.... A Must Own.True to the book and true to the men who lived and died to defeat true evil.Talk about ""Heroes"" - the most overused, misused term in our language... These guys were the real deal.Spielberg and Hanks put together an absolutely top quality series that is worth watching more than once. INMHO, better than Private Ryan or for that matter - any war movie, period. There are some difficult and gruesome things to watch - be warned. But in context - it is appropriate to tell the true story.After seeing it - I had to get the book. Very inspiring.Thanks HBO!"
5,Just WOW!,"""The Greatest Generation""...much has been said about that phrase, both in the positive and in the negative. Band of Brothers shows, from a very bottom up perspective, the human condition during one of the largest events in human history to date. A very well put together series with obviously a big budget. From training to the end of WWII in Europe the story focuses on a small group of men that live, eat, sleep, train, fight and some times die together. Puts into perspective on a very human level how ordinary people deal with life when they are caught in extraordinary circumstances. I cannot recommend this series enough, especially to the ""younger"" generations."
5,Amazing Production,"Band of Brothers is a phenomenally told story of epic proportions. The characters seem so real, because they are, and hearing their stories first hand is both inspiring and heartbreaking. Though this was purchased on BluRay not all sequences of the film were in high definition ( though most were ) and the ones that weren't only added to the gritty war feel of the film. If you love true stories, war stories, and stories of relationships that survive when people do not, this is for you. My husband and I will watch this again and again."
5,Band of Brothers,DVD mini-series about the book by the same name. The mini-series was very well done! Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg rock!
5,Love it!,"Being an old Army guy I love war and action movies. Over the years I have watched this series many times(not in HD though) and never tire of it. I am sure like all Hollywood telling of stories there are exaggerations, but this story is so believable, with such realism in the battle scenes it draws you in, and I just never tire of watching it.If you liked Saving Private Ryan(did), or The Pacific(did not), you'll love this...get in in Blu-Ray."
1,Any one else have a problem with disk 1?,"I bought this set last week and found that disk #1 would not play in my machine. All the others did. I returned it, got a replacement and the same problem. Anyone else having trouble with disk 1?"
2,Not all great,The capes were great and that is why I bought it. My son has a similar set and only uses the capes...so my nephew will most likely break the plastic masks soon. The batarang broke the first time it was thrown and hit the ground.
2,Not appropriate,"This video contains provocative dancing from the cartoonish characters. We only watched the first few songs for numbers 1-4. The music was catchy, but not great for remembering tables."
3,Good music....,"I prefer her later works. This one is heavier on the Celtic music, and doesn't highlight her, the harp, or her talents as much as I would like. Still, good music and a nice cd."
3,"New Woody Allen movie.Great cast. Not outrageously funny, but not terrible either. It was good, I say B","The new comedy from Woody Allen. Story about a family who is falling apart...Husband (Hopkins) leaves his wife of 40 years...and that's just the beginning. The subject matter doesn't seem funny, but it works as a comedy, Woody Allen has a way of doing that. Husband leaves his wife, who is seeing a psychic, for a woman half his age, daughter has crush on her boss, her husband has crush on the neighbor. I've never been a Woody Allen fan, I have only really liked a few of his movies. This one was not that bad. It was very entertaining and enjoyable, but not one of my favorites. If you like Woody Allen I'm sure you will really enjoy this. If you are like me and are not a huge fan, this is still very watchable and a pretty good time. The cast is excellent and it's worth watching for that. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - Most likely not."
3,Pretty Good,The characterizations were great. So was the acting. It did seem that the production company ran out of money at the end because the ending is a bit abrupt. It would've been nice to what became of all the characters. W. Allen does a good job in showing us how people's lives are at times so tragic they're comic.
4,I Speak for this Child,"This is an excellent book for beginning to understand what children in the foster system experience. It's told from the viewpoint of a CASA/GAL volunteer as she relates some of her cases. As this is something that I am working on doing, I found reading this book to be very helpful."
2,Kinda flimsy,"One of these arrived cracked, but we were able to make it work. I fear that the first time I have to remove one of these covers it will break for good. The wire retention rings are a good idea."
2,Stink.,The bands get stinky in a week. Wash them. Fine. Fade very quickly. THEN! Then the face cracked when I lightly placed it on a granite counter top. Very weak.
4,good buy,"Great watch. Keeps great time. The bands are easy too change and they have a nice vintage look. Only setback is the arm in the bands are too short. The are passes through too easy. Other than that, I highly recommend this watch"
1,Terrible watch,"This watch was so terrible, i threw it away within two weeks... I was looking for a watch to wear while at work, and it looked great. I was WRONG. It came with 3 bands, all three bands lasted a couple days. They wouldn't stay on my wrist. i had it pinned in the third hole, and in minutes the pin would collapse down. Worst thing i have bought in a long time. I do not recommend unless your buying something for target practice with something else from this company!"
4,Very Serviceable,Excellent and perfectly fitting substitute for original equipment design. I would definitely recommend for both utility and price. Buy it.
5,Familiarity Influences Preference,"Many of the later seasons of The Simpsons are as good or better than earlier seasons. Why do people think they're worse? Because they're not nearly as familiar as the classic episodes. Familiarity is a major predictor of likability. These episodes are fantastic on their first run through, but they're even better after twenty views. Why? In addition to the whole familiarity effect, it's because the writers usually pack in so many jokes you miss one or two a minute, just with normal lapses of attention. So, quit putting down the later seasons, be thankful such a wonderful show still continues after all of these years, and find how wonderful life is without so much cynicism!"
5,Simpsons is the best show ever,The seasons just keep getting better and better. Best animated series ever created. A must have for any simpsons fan.
3,About Time,"It's about time another season of the Simpsons is released. I'm getting so tired and i'm sure others are to of having to wait a whole year for just one season. Another thing is the awful packaging that started with the 11th season, come on people like myself pay anywhere from $30-$40 and as soon as you open a set the discs are already scratched. But anyways, this season for me was a hit and miss. As of this writing you can get this season for $26.49 including tax at a little place that rhymes with ""ARGET"""
4,Good place to start,"As a novice, this is a great book to start exploring coffee roasting. Easy to follow and very informative."
5,The Diet Trap,"Let's face it. Dieting and the discovering the secret to loosing weight quickly is a top money making proposition in the world today. We all want to look good and be healthy. Many people have found out how to manipulate and fool the body into loosing weight and fat for a period of time. But we also know that our chances of keeping it off are slim to none. In Pam Smith's ""The Diet Trap"", she explores many of the popular quick methods to reach these goals and why they don't and won't work! As a registered dietician, Pam explains what it takes (eating, exercising,drinking water, rest) for our bodies to release its ability to function properly and rid itself of excess fat storage. It's not a gimmick, it's just the facts. It is not a quick fix, it is a new way of life. Anyone serious enough to face the facts and wants to truly take care of themselves should BUY THIS BOOK. Personally, I have succeeded so far in losing 20 pounds and am on my way to a new way of living after 43 years."
5,Another good book,Nora Roberts is one of the best authors I read..every book of hers takes you on a mission that you can place yourself in and ride it out.
3,great read,"tends to follow the same story line as other books by Nora Roberts, but still a great book to read."
3,Boundary Lines,"Although I am an avid Nora Roberts fan, I was not particularly engaged with this book. It lacked a comprehensive plot line."
2,not one of her best,"I am a big Nora Roberts fan, but this was a very predictable, not well written book. I was fairly disappointed in this book."
3,"inexpensive, tore and had to be repaired, but does the job","Fits over the bar as advertised, but when I first separated the velcro the plastic tore and I had to repair it with duct tape. Even so, it does the job and I'll but a couple more to store clothing in my attic and keep the stink bugs off. The bag is very cheaply made but it's also the most inexpensive bag I could find so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Good for storage,"Product worth the price and good for storing clothing for extended period of time, Would recommend to others. Should consider for both long and short term storage needs."
4,Excellent see through bad for longs coats or desses,"Thanks to the very detailed reviews of other customers, I was able to figure out that this was the right choice. I am using it in my coat closet to provide protection for my beautiful long winter coats and some jackets. Having 2 zippers is highly useful - makes it easy to access any garment. Looks nice! Ought to protect against any pests and well as dust. It will keep cooking odors from the kitchen from getting embedded in the cloth. I am extremely pleased. The vinyl is quite substantial The only reason that I did not give this 5 stars is that my preference is for very heavy gauge vinyl - but this seems to be a very good product. I feel more confident about what guest will see when I open my coat closet for them. As the coats are very heavy, I am very pleased to have them hanging on the wooden pole. A strip of Velcro fastens the plastic over the top of the garments so that nothing can crawl in through the top!"
4,Blue is worth the while,"This is not an example of great story telling, in terms of plot. The guilty party is easily recognized halfway through the book, and the attempts to keep the readers off the trail become annoying and pointless. Not to mention the why of it is also very stupid. Those points aside it is a very involving read, I finished it in one sitting. What raises this story a star above what I would really give it is its delve into the world of Wicca. It isn't overblown with the obvious powers of levitation and all the other powers of black magic. It sticks to its roots, which is really nice. So enjoy, because this book is a sample of an above passable teen book."
3,Good Start To A Series.,"I liked this book, it was a fun read but it just didn't completely capture me like some of her other books have.I did like the story line and the characters so I would be willing to try the next book in the series. I know that sometimes first books in series can be rough so I am hoping the series gets better as it goes."
4,Blue is for Nightmares,I enjoyed this book. The characters all seemed believable as well as likeable. The book often left me in suspense throughout the time I was reading it. The author was good at being descripitive and answering any questions I had while reading the book. The only reason I gave the book four stars instead of five is because sometimes the author's style of writing seemed to annoy me. Overall it was a good book and an easy one to read.
3,Arabian Tea Jasmine Plant,"The shipping was prompt. I received what would be a good size for a house plant, which is what I was looking for. The only problem I had was that it is advertised as being in bloom and the plant I had was far from that. However, the plant appears healthy and may still bloom so I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,Arabian Tea Jasmine in excellent condition,"I order 2 of Arabian Tea Jasmine Plant - Maid of Orleans - 6"" Pot from Hirt's Gardens and received in 3 days late. The plants are in very good condition, very healthy, very full and buded, but the pot size is not 6"" inch. I left a message about the pot size to the seller. The seller responsed next day and shipped the correct items immidiately. My Arabian Tea Jasmine Plant - Maid of Orleans were received today in excellent condition,healthy and full buded. Thank Hirt's Gardens for your prompt and courtesy services."
5,Very good service but...,"The plants arrived just fine and really fast. They looked fine on arrival. Over time however, the shock of travel has had its toll. I am quite good at making my plants survive and thrive and so I have somehow managed to save them but they are no longer in the lush condition they arrived in. This is not the seller's fault but my own difficulty in finding this plant easily locally. So if you know how to care for the mogra jasmine and can't find it locally, please order from the seller- doing it in warmer weather has its own challenges. Spring and fall would be good times to order- but be prepared for some nursing care for the plants. The seller sends healthy robust plants but the travel takes its toll."
2,Jasmine Maid of Orleans Plant,I ordered 2 Jasmine Maid of Orleans from 9Greenbox early March 2011. My order arrived on time and the packaging is good. I'm just disappointed because the plants are small with just one stem and very fragile. I think it will take a while before this plant become establish and a long time before I see flowers.I will place this indoor by a windowsills and hopefully it will grow and blossom with a lot of flowers.
5,Jasmine Plant,I ordered this plant in June. It was all I had hoped for and more. Great smell and is growing very quickly. I ordered from Hirts Gardens and I came very quickly and very fragrant! Great buy and I will be purchasing more plants in the future.
4,Useful information,I teach the class for the Red Cross and was in need of an extra copy of this book. Wonderful information in an easy reading layout.
4,Better Holiday Dinners Mean a Better Turkey...,"Last week me and my boyfriend made the basic roast turkey recipe and it was the best turkey I ever tasted. The skin is cooked crispy but not burned. The meat, even the white meat is juicy and tender, and the gravy compliments the bird so well you'll want to make turkey every week. Some may be discouraged that you need to soak the turkey for 12 hours beforehand, but believe me, the end result is worth it.This book is worth buying just for the praise you would get on holidays from making this recipe."
4,a decent self inflating mat,"I went motorcycle camping right after Christmas. It got down to 25 degrees at night. The Swiss Gear Self Inflating Mat kept me off the coldground. It packed compact enough to be carried between my windshield and my handlebars. The pillow had to be blown into to get the ""pillow"" effect.If purchasing again, I would try to find one at least 3 inches thick wheninflated. It appears to be a quality product. Much needed in winter camping."
1,Does not last; No customer service,"I hope my experience helps you avoid the costly buyer's remorse I experienced.The visual appearance is good - it appears to be more substantial than the average Made in China air mattress. It was not really ""Self Inflating,"" since you must blow some air into it to inflate. Still, that would be OK with me if the product worked.My 95-pound daughter used this just four times, all indoors. The bottom seam separated on the fourth night. I do not mean that any pinhole leaks developed - rather, the bottom seam/junction just separated. And, you can see that for inches on either side of the hole that the seam is beginning to loosen there as well.Emails to customer service went unanswered for either warranty support or even repair instructions. No matter what the price you pay, this mattress seems unlikely to last long enough to give value. And, customer service is non-existent."
4,Exciting Whodunit !,I enjoy the writing style of Peter T. Dutermann. I like the way his plots play out. Always exciting and keeps readers like me on the edge of their seats during the entire book.
5,Great Entertainment,British comedy at it's finest. The characters on the show are hilarious. I also recommend Are you Being Served and Jeeves and Wooster.
4,"It's not Faulty Towers, but pretty good","My wife has been a longtime fan of Faulty Towers, and we heard that this show was similar. While it's not quite as funny (without John Cleese) - it's clever, and similarly quick paced. The quality of the recording is what you would expect from a show this old. Worth a shot if you are a fan of this type of comedy. The whole series price is a good value."
5,Long Time Fan,"Enjoy this gen of Brit humor. Great cast and clever storylines. Glad to find this hard to find ""Complete Collection""."
4,Get the complete collection,I am so happy I got the whole collections. You get all the episodes and specials. This is timeless and everybody knows these charectors from thier own life.
3,Ups and Downs of ARE YOU BEING SERVED?,First: I really like ARE YOU BEING SERVED? Second: But some of these reproductions are flawed and scramble dialog which is a problem.
5,Awesome collection!,I absolutely love this series. I started watching this show on the BBC network in the nineties. I'm so excited to own all the episodes now. The cast is wonderful together and are the funniest I've seen! My whole family watches it now and its reached another generation! :)
4,"good,but short",this book was my kind of book. Only it took me 2 minuits to read it.I cant wait to read the sequel even though people say its horrible. (sorry Sanvoisin.)
4,A GREAT BOOK FOR HALLOWEEN,We read this book in our speech class and thought it wasgreat. The ink drinker was scary and we didn't want to put the bookdown. It is the perfect story to read for Halloween. We would highly recommend this book to 4th and 5th graders. We can't wait for the sequel! We hope to see some ink drinkers on Halloween night.
5,beautiful black and white photography of everyday miracles,"Giving Birth provides a graphic but loving view of a cross-section of couples deeply involved in the process of bringing new life into the world.I'm sure the pictures could be somewhat disturbing to the uninitiated, but to the women who have had an unmedicated birth and can remember both the pain, wonder and pleasure involved,these pictures bring back exqusitite memories. The text is lovely and touching. It adds a great deal to the overall experiance of this outstanding book."
1,Unacceptable Merchandise,"I would have been embarrassed to have shipped this poor excuse for merchandise to anyone. It was so very disappointing to think that anyone would have tried to take advantage of people by placing a nice picture of a lawn mower replica on the internet and then to send out such a piece of junk. It was very tiny and had to be put together and painted and stickers , that were so tiny you could not read them, placed on it. There is no way it would have looked like the posted picture even if you put it together. You can be sure I will never order from this company again nor will I recommend them to anyone. If this is an indication of what this company has, Amazon would be wise to drop them."
2,not the best,"I didnt care for this album very much. Extremelly ambient, not very textured just kinda blane. Dont get me wrong i own all the moogs their all worth listening to but 2 is just listening to 1 extremelly long song only good for tranquil moments and light meditation. I would say that its not as good cause they were just getting started but i absolutelly love the first album awesome, very textural and lavish. Find out for you self"
2,Disappointing,"I've owned the Lyra RD1080 for a few months now. I've got more complaints about this MP3 player than any other MP3 player I've owned.1) The mp3-to-mpy conversion causes some of my mp3 files (around 5%) to be garbled when played on the Lyra. These mp3 files play fine on every other player I've tried2) The software has no reformat option available. I had to go to Windows explorer, find the portable device mounted as a hard drive, and manually reformat the device myself3) I could not get the FM tuner to work at all. I live in Chicago, and I couldn't pick up a single FM station.Even though the price per MB looks attractive for the Lyra, save your money and buy a Rio. I wish I had."
5,Awesome player,"This player was very easy to set up. Since I use Win2k the drivers were preinstalled. MusicMatch works extremely well. I use the AutoDJ function to create a playlist of about 2.5 hrs in length (My files are generally 128 kbps) and then use the portable manager to trim the playlist down to 128MB so it fits. I like the idea that it is expandable, although I haven't added any storage yet because 128MB is generally adequate for trips to the supermarket and gym and putting new music on it is such a snap. The FM tuner worked well in the stands at a football game. The big display screen is a huge plus. I would add an arm strap to the carrying case, but the player is so small and light that this a minor inconvenience. For the money this is the best player on the market."
2,Not what it's promised to be.,I think this is a great MP3 player and radio. But I bought it because it was supposed to play MP3Pro (MP3 grown up) and WMA (Windows Media) files. It plays neither! I contacted RCA Tech Support and they explained that there will be a firmware upgrade in about 2 months.Isn't that false advertising?I'm returning mine and contacting a lawyer and the Better Business Bureau.
1,Don't buy it,"Received it as a gift this last Christmas. Thought it was great until I went to use it a month later and the audio went out on one side. The replacement unit took about 2 months to get and it went out the first time I went jogging. In June, they said they weren't receiving any more of the units (Thompson), so they would do a buy back. I just received a check for ""fair market value"" for $76.24. Since I don't have an orginal sales receipt, I get the price they sell it to vendors. I asked to get a unit instead of this buyback deal, they are expected to get any more units. The cost is still $120-130. My advice, don't buy it. Looks and when it works it's great, but if it breaks you'll have a headache."
5,Getting the most bang for your MP3 buck.,"After using the Nike Rio MP3 player for a year, then picking up the RCA, it is evident RCA is doing a few things right. First, an awesome feature is the digital radio, which comes in handy when you're tired of listening to your MP3s. Secondly, the sound is amazing providing large-speaker like sound. Finally, the price is excellent. For [a very reasonable price] you get 128MB with an expandable slot."
2,You can do much better,"This was my 2nd MP3 player and I was disappointed in it from several perspectives:1. As noted, the volume button is very fragile.2. The most recent viewers did not mention software download problems, but I had nothing but issues (running Win/XP Professional) AND I didn't like being locked into ""MusicMatch"".3. Sound is fair. I know that MP3 has lost some quality, but this unit seemed worse than most.4. RCA's web (and phone) support is poor. This made the software problems even more frustrating.5. I found presetting radio stations and then bringing them back up to be difficult, error prone and counter-intuitive. An extra button or better button debouncing would have been greatly appreciated. This was at its worst when exercising or jogging.I gave up on it when the volume button broke and I was tired of having to re-install MusicMatch and bought an iRiver IFP-395 which was one of the best decisions of my life."
2,The perfect gift...for an enemy,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and decided to set it up and load some Xmas songs so she could use it right away. At first, I was very happy as I plugged it in to the USB port, XP recognized it, I drug the songs over to player (shows up as a drive) and they copied (slowly). But no luck playing them. Pored through the manual. Not much help. Loaded Musicmatch software. It trys to take over all defaults for the music on your computer. It trys to sell you more software. etc. Directions don't match the menus. Finally, found out how to transfer files. Didn't work right. Way too much technical overhead required to operate this poorly designed and executed product. I'm taking it back."
1,No Support No mp3pro,Don't do it if your motivation is to play mp3pro. RCA has been promising an upgrade for almost a year and all we have is vaporware. Customer support will not answer emails and apparently don't value customers at all.
3,Good and Bad,The RCA Lyra is a Great piece of machinary. But there are some flaws. When listining to the radio sometime it can cross in with another sation. This is really anoying when your listing to a great song. But the Best part of the machine is The MP3. When you buy this you should also purchases a memeory card which can help you hold about 70 more song. You can also store songs on these card and save them like as if they were ds. You take one out then put another one in. The card also speed up the downloading process. The Downloading process is also very easy. It a simple 1...2..3. It took me 5 minutes to download a whole album. And you can name you songs. and the player will svae them inorder for you. It very simpile. It also has a programmming mode which allows you to save your radio stations. Once agian its a good piece of hardware excptfor the radio inteference and it lack of the ability to record son from the radio and vioces which are avialble in many of the newer models.
2,Great Player until it breaks,"I bought one of these players about 4 months ago and I loved it. On occasion it would ""hang up"", but I considered that a minor annoyance, as was the cheesy plastic belt clip. Unfortunately, the volume control on my player is now stuck, it can only be turned down. If I take the batteries out it will reset but it will only reset the volume to 13. This would be a great player if it were not for the obvious quality control issues. THIS PLAYER WILL QUIT WORKING VERY QUICKLY!!!"
1,Don't by a Lyra if you own a Mac!,It simply doesn't work with a Macintosh computer. Neither system X or system 9. The RCA support has been hard to reach and no help at all. I've bought an expensive product that I can't use at all. Karl Bradley in North Florida
2,Sit do not Stand,"I found Last Stand in a used book store (it is quite old). It concerns the take-back of Manhattan - particularly Rockefeller Center -by a Native American Tribe. It is called thrilling (no) and compared to Grisham and Clancy (no). It is fantasy pure and simple, but I had nothing else to read. It was well written, but completely unbelievable!! I cannot recommend it. Oh, one more thing. The Mayor of NY is caught on tape dissing all the citizens, police, you name it. He wants to run for governor and at the close of the book he is still Mayor (lol) and running for Governor. I repeat, fantasy. The only thing vaguely resembling truth is the objection of father of an Italian daughter to marry a Native American. I know from experience, in some Italian families if you are not of Italian descent you are less of a person. lol"
2,Some okay quotes but not worth keeping,"This is such a poor collection that I gave it away. A better selection can be found on Brainyquote. Even better, get the following:Selected Verse: Dual-Language Edition With Plain Prose Translations of Each Poem (Penguin Poets) (German Edition)David Luke chooses better sections."
1,so much rubish,"this gentleman may have been around a funeral home cemetery operation but he didn't learn much.he tried to sensatioalize and exagerate most of what he talks about,with total diregard for the truth"
4,Good,"I like it. I probably should've gotten a bigger one since it doesn't hold much, but it works great for the size."
2,Was Perfect for 3 weeks,I eat salad every day in the summer. I buy fresh organic greens that have to be washed. This little spinner was perfect. It worked great for 3 weeks. I am not heavy handed and have most of my appliances for years. I did not over fill the basket. I had about 2 servings of kale and baby spinach. I pushed down on the top like I always do to spin it and heard a snap. The spin mechanism came apart broken. It is broken and cannot be repaired. I am very disappointed. I am undecided on if I should buy the same brand. I really need a salad spinner.
1,the actions on carrier commands for aircraft are screwed up and balleship cannot be sunk .,The commands to the carrier aircraft do not do as tutorial explain. The planes only fly aruond in circles. With only your hands on control of the aircraft can the battleship be attacked. Plus no heavy damage is ever done to the battleship.
3,"It's OK, strategy better than game play","The strategic parts of the game are better than some of the game play, especially the flying. The naval simulation parts are better, and feel more realistic. The flying simulation has a high amount of lag (even a 747 is more responsive in real life than these fighters). Airplanes are not like ships, and there is not this much overshoot. There are better flying sims than this. The ships do have a realistic amount of fluidity. Having to manage resources in the ship while fighting is nice. The graphics are fairly good, but not outstanding. The learning curve is a little higher than some games, and I agree with the other review that states it's tough when you are playing the games between taking care of kids, etc (or bouncing between games and don't play some games for a while)..."

2,Another bore-to-death book by Le Carre!,Ridiculous plots with absolutely no fundmental logical premises. This book is like written by a college student with lot of imaginary thought-so plots but actually ridiculous with no realistic experience in Espinage or couter-terrorist professions
3,Somewhat entertaining,"Complicated and sometimes long winded, but overall an interesting book for those that pay attention to details. If, for example, someone were to confuse the Israeli agents in this book for English, they would probably enjoy it as much as they would ""Hunt for Red October"" if they confused the Soviets for German Nazis."
2,"Some interesting exercises, but lots' of techno babble","This was really confusing, and obviously not a great deal of time went into organizing this. I found 3 good exercises, the rest was just difficult to understand. The nutrition section which was hyped up in the amazon promo was really poor. Also, the section on cardio training was almost non-existent and I feel that is really important. I should of known when it said spiral bound."

4,A wounderful piece of work.,The Border Empire was very thrilling to read.This story kept me in suspence from cover to cover.I look forward to reading the rest of the GUNFIGHTER series.
1,unbelievable FRAUD,"When I got my hands on this book, I couldn't believe my eyes.The whole text is written in fonts 20(!) or more, every page has maximum 11 lines, so you can imagine the whole text is all together less than 10, yes 10 (ten), pages of an ordinary paperback.The information is a joke,it is based upon personnal beliefs of the ""author"", if one could call him that, saying that no one should worry of losing hair if he is dressed nicely, cuts his hair short and stop thinking about it. I am an M.D. from Athens, Greece, my specialty is E.N.T., and I have been facing hair loss problems for the last 8 years.I ordered this book, together with other ones, hoping to get something that is missing usually from the medical literature, the human factor point of view.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, IT IS A JOKE!Your mom can give you better advice for free."
5,Britcom,This is a fantastic collection of all the Keeping Up Apperances with bloopers and lots of other cast information.
5,Keeping Up Apparences,"I love it, I got a fantastic price and the box really was not badly damaged at all! I could hardley see the damage! The movie were great all good quality, no scraches. Loved Loved Loved It! Thanks! Avoir!"
2,"could not see it, the wrong landline","I could not open it, because it was only for American televisions not German.So sorry, but so I sent it back."
5,Love the Full Bouquet!,We love watching little mini 'marathons' of this show. It's a very fun filled few hours. Quite glad we purchased the Full Bouquet!
5,I love Hyacinth!,"My fiance got this for me for Valentine's Day and I could not be more pleased with it. There are even outtakes, and a little spot about Patricia Routledge as an actress, and she is so wonderful. I couldn't be more pleased with it."
4,Keeping Up Appearances,The price seemed reasonable- it was purchased as a birthday gift.It arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition.The recipient was overjoyed.
4,BBC Video,"Took a little longer to receive than I am used to, but it arrived in good condition. Watched 4 of the discs so far and they are excellant. If any of the others have flaws, I'll update this."
5,Excellent! Excellent! EXCELLENT!!!,"If you're a ""Keeping Up Appearances"" fan, this is a must have with every show plus more. Well worth every penny. Enjoy!"
1,Badly Written Thesis of What Most People Have Always Known,"The premise of liberal bias in TV journalisim has been recognized for many years. Goldberg's elaboration adds very little to the knowledge of this premise.No index and no footnotes enforce my belief that this book was more of a personal vendetta directed mostly at CBS News and others, rather then a professional documentation of an unfortunate condition.I personnally learned very little from this book."
2,A directionless rant.,"I know there's liberal bias in the media. At this point, who doesn't? I hoped this book would provide clear, well organized evidence. While Goldberg's work is clearly thoughtful and no doubt insightful, I found his constant sarcasm and rambling style very tiresome. While the book is full of specifics, there is little direction, and Goldberg's tone reduces his thoughtful arguments to directionless rants."
5,Finally!...an insider speaks out,This book reveals what most of us already knew but never hear anyone report on. The bias in the media is overwelming. To the guy who says that corporations own the media and are therefore conservative....hogwash!...Fox News is the only network who could be labeled as such. Don't forget that CNN is owned by Ted Turner.Goldberg himself is a registered democrat and has never voted Republican...ever!This is an old style newsman who got fed up with being told what to report.
4,"Like campaign finance ""reform""? Read Goldberg.","As others have noted, this book seems padded, and the writing style would probably yield a ""C"" in high school English (someone please steal the exclamation point key from Goldberg's computer).That said, this is an important book because it represents a whistle-blower turning the tables on CBS and the other major media. (Shall we call them ""Big Baloney""?) Boy, how sore they get when they are the target. Goldberg carefully shows how homelessness, AIDS and feminist issues are slanted by the self-righteous liberals populating the major media.Those who favor campaign finance reform must read this. After all, the huge sums raised by candidates are used to buy TV time in order to influence thinking on public issues. If that ability is restricted, it will mean giving more power to Dan, Peter and Tom who use their soap boxes night after night to frame these issues the way Democrats like."
4,Courageous Truth from a TRUE Journalist,"What did CBS journalist Bernard Goldberg do that caused him to be ostracized by ""tough investigative journalists who celebrate whistleblowers""? He blew the whistle---oops--it turned out he blew the whistle on the wrong people though. The ones who dish it out can't take it. What big secret did he reveal? Something anyone with a modicum of objectivity (or even common sense) knew already, i.e., that TV network news is blatant biased.Dan Rather, Andrew Heyward, Eric Engberg...the list of ""tough news people"" who come down hard on others are revealed for the thin skinned hypocrites they are. All Goldberg does is report the facts. He details accounts of meetings, interactions, conversations. Ironically, in his concluding analysis, Goldberg show how Dan Rather became the very thing he hated. I won't spoil the surprise. Hint: it involves Rather's nemesis President Richard Nixon."
4,Whiny but Good,"Two aspects of this book are worthy of mention. Goldberg complains about the treatment he received at the hands of CBS and ""The Dan."" In the midst of this narrative, Goldberg manages an eye-opening damning of the main stream media.Bernard Goldberg was mistreated by CBS, of this, I have no doubt. His book, however would have been better served by a little less complaint and more focus on the case which his mistreatment contributes to. That the elite media is liberally biased when it comes to the big social issues of the day.He's right, of course, and the other aspect of the book worth mention is that it's an excellent eye-opener. Every American should read this book. We've been seeing our world through liberal colored glasses, and it's time we took them off to get an honest view of what's really hapenning."
5,Finally,"This book did my heart good. The left-wing newspeople slander us in Israel every day, and it's not often that someone gets the truth out.Naturally, I was interested in BG's treatment of the Jews-murder-Christian-children libels and the praise of Hitler in Egyptian state-run newspapers. But his treatment was superficial. There are thousands of every-day distortions that BG failed to cite.Example:A few months after Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize, he went to a mosque in South Africa, and told worshippers to prepare for a jihad against Israel. CNN reported the event, and carefully explained that ""jihad"" was an ambiguous term, was not necessarily related to violence!I'm disappointed that BG didn't discuss the media's treatment of Israel in more detail. Still, I loved the book and many other illiterate, lunatic-fringe wackos like me will love it, too."
2,"Good column topic, mediocre book","Here's a review of the book that isn't based on an opinion of the politics involved. Mr. Goldberg's newspaper editorial piece that ignited his fame was the right vehicle for his opinions. A few hundred words, a few examples culled from his years of experience at CBS made his opinions interesting and insightful, whether or not you agree with his analysis.However, even as one who generally agrees with what he's saying, the book was painful to read after the first few chapters. I found it repetitious and shallow. After the first 50 pages or so, you've read everything unique he has to say. This book proves why Mr. Goldberg was a producer at CBS and not on-air-talent. He's not Andy Rooney, more like a not-funny bitter shadow of Andy Rooney."
1,Poppycock and rubbish!,"I read the first half of this book and, as a person who leans toward the center of the political spectrum, I would have laughed if thihs book hadn't made me ill. The obvious misinformation made this book read like a Nazi or Soviet propoganda tool more than any informed, researched analysis of the American media. Lame lame lame. Shame shame shame.There are many more books on the media in America out there. Read any of them before this one!"
1,Another Biased book filled with lies,As Al Franklin proved on Donahue when he confronted Goldberg with the many lies and false truths presented in this book (the transcripts can easily be found on the web); there is blatant skewing of facts and quotes taken out of context in this book. I wouldn't even use the pages of this book to pick up my dog's ....
2,slap-dash effort,"Bernard Goldberg's theme is a good one. I'd hoped for support of that theme with heavy use of anecdotal evidence. Some of that is here. Otherwise, its a whine about Dan Rather's cold-shoulder after Goldberg's original op-ed piece in the WSJ. His writing is often exclamatory which strengthened the feeling that he was throwing in emotion to back up weak points. There are often surprising leaps from disconnected premises to, what he would have us believe, are obvious conclusions.The book was not a total waste of time. I believe the idea that our news should be digested while keeping in mind its distribution through mainly liberal filters is important. Mr. Goldberg does present a few anecdotes which demonstrate this in the book but the problem is that there are as many weak ones presented with as much emphasis.I also didn't like the amount of time spent personally vindicating himself. It made me question his motives and his own bias."
1,Tell us something we didnt already know,"Mr Goldberg voted liberal his entire life and yet he turned to every Republican talk show to push his book against liberals. In my opinion Goldberg is a traitor to his liberal members and a traitor to his country. The question is...Why did the Republican talk shows all give him a chance to push his book. Thats like giving Benedict Arnold a chance to sell his book to the English on American TV. Utter disgrace! How he can manuever his face in the mirror, let alone on TV, baffles the mind."
1,The trite commets continues,"Same old B.S. about the media being a liberal entity. If that carried any significant weight, we'd have never hear about the stained dress let alone Monica.If the media was as liberal as Bernie and FOX claim, Ann Coulter could never get press coverage and Limbaugh would have failed two decades ago.Let's stick to the facts. Talk about how the media truly disorts and in the MANY areas on ALL sides of the issue."
5,THE TRUTH THE LEFT CANT STAND!,"To the people that say Rush, and Ollie, and G Gordon Liddy are to the right, well they are! but what they do is considered an op ed type of reporting, not main stream like Rather, jennings, and Brokaw. So if you want the truth that the Left refuses to tell buy this book its an eye opener!"
2,Opinion not based on fact,"Goldberg's book has cause quite a stir. However, the book is little more than a trashing of Dan Rather and a manifesto by an angry ex-employee. If the author wants to examine bias,he should do so in a more systematic, scientific fashion. For example, he could have analyzed news broadcasters use of certain buzzwords or count the number of stories that leaned liberal or leaned conservative. Anyone who wants an unbiased view of this debate should shy away from this rant."
5,Goldberg clearly explains the media's slide,"Bernard Goldberg has written a book that explains exactly why (and how) the major networks have lost viewership. The big three (Brokaw, Jennings, and Rather) are so openly blatant in their liberal bias and probably do not even understand their failings. Viewers have switched to alternate sources, such as Fox News Network, for their news and eventually it will send a wake-up call to the major network bosses. The real question is why is it taking so long? Goldberg's book is a thoughtful, not a spiteful, story of the dying of network news."
2,Lost Opportunity,This became too self serving...maybe the whole thing could fit in a WSJ op ed. It is an interesting and certainly it is true that the network news is baised.
1,Good Content - Not so good writing,"The book is focused on the medias bias, the fact that not all the media is neutral. The author has some interesting and factual data, but the writing is hard to read and follow. The author uses an approach full of short stories that are not well linked to the story. It takes too many pages to describe a single fact, using too many words. I was expecting more from this book. Good approach, bad execution."
2,BIAS- Runs out of STEAM,"I agreed with some of Goldberg's points about liberal biasin the media. However, I think stories' content are more about reporters' laziness vs actual bias. I do think he does a lot of whining and putting down people (like Peter Jennings) without real justification.If he was truly peaved about his treatment at CBS News - he should have left sooner - not just waiting for his pension to kick in. This book was an easy read - but lacking any real substance."
3,SKB 4814W deluxe ATA golf case- GREAT!!!,"Loaded my new case with Sun Mountain cart bag full of clubs, balls, rain suit, wind shirt, 2 towels, umbrella, flask, cigars, and all the little accessories, wrapped an extra towel around the heads and flew to Tennessee and back on Southwest. Had to tuck in the side pockets but really easy to do. Weighed in at 48 lbs., 2 lb. under the overweight limit. Probably could have fit shoes but didn't try. Worked most excellent, would recommend highly. Don't try to fit a pro bag though. TSA lock system worked great, they checked it both ways and actually relocked it, WOW!!! Not a mark on the case, 2 people actually asked me about it cause it didn't even show any scuff marks."
4,Golf club travel case,"This is an excellent travel case for taking your cart bag with you on a trip. The bag is enormous, but this means it is big enough to carry the cart bag intact, and when you get to your destination, you can pull your cart bag out and away you go. Be careful over loading it- it's possible you could go over airline guideline weights if fully loaded with shoes etc. But it has a very sturdy design, and latches, and the TSA security locks give you peace of mind.If had been a little lighter (and a little cheaper), it might have got a 5 star rating."
3,Treacle for those with sweet tooth,"It's not bad work, that's for sure, but is far too sweet, too cloying. Sternfeld is not the greatest portraitist out there, and certainly can't hold a candle to Arbus. Ok, who could? But wait, take a look at Mark Steinmetz trilogy of books in the South of contemporary USA. Spend your money there instead."
5,A good gift...,"For those people who either collect old physique pictoral, or appreciate good balck & white photography...this is a good find. It arrived quickly & in good condition. Thanks."
4,Interesting premise,Based on accurate scientific data (per the author) this fictional tale is well-crafted. It's a quick read with good character development.
4,Miracle Blanket did the job,"Yes it is better and larger then Kiddopotamus Swaddling Blanket, yes it is well made quality, yes my baby hands stayed inside, yes it decrease his crying like 80% of the time, but I didn't give it 5 stars because it is so expensive for a simple blanket. I think 15$ will be fair price."
2,Not the miracle I was hoping for,"My daughter, at 12 weeks, was able to totally unswaddle herself using the swaddleme that we had been using since birth, yet she still needed to be swaddled to fall asleep. She can't seem to calm down without being swaddled and she claws at her face which wakes her up. Everyone I knew told me to get the miracle blanket and it would solve all my problems. Maybe if we had used this from birth she would have been okay with it. But, she hated having her arms tucked under the folds, screamed like crazy, and even though they were tucked under, she was still able to bring them up and out of the blanket, with the folds still around them. It didn't take her long to get out of this blanket. So we got one hour out of it. We switched to the Halo that she can move her arms around in but still can't get them up out of the fabric to her face."
2,My baby HATES this straight jacket,"This may work for other babies but my little girl screamed bloody murder when I put it on her. It wasn't just a adjustment cry, it lasted 45 minutes. Her arms couldn't get straight because she was resisting so much so while in the swaddle, her little arms were a bit crooked. She looked so uncomfortable."
1,Useless,"Not easy to use, baby did not like it. Very thin material. Useless product. Do not waste $30 for this."
4,I CLEP'ed Away 20 Credits!,"This book helped me shave 20 credits off of my requirements to graduate! I only wish I would have found out about the CLEP program sooner (before I took other classes that I could have most likely tested out of).The key to studying this book is to do the practice tests, and also know what the non-answers are (If the answer is ""B""...also study what ""A"", ""C"" and ""D"" are in relation to the subject in which you are studying). They WILL show up in the test. I PROMISE YOU!This book is a good buy!"
4,A GREAT WAY TO START...,"This book will show you where your strengths, and weaknesses lay for each CLEP.It will also show you how EASY most of these test are.I should be finished CLEP'ing my way to a four degree by 12/07.Trust me, BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Love this book,"I've used Visual Quickstart books for years. I've used them for Photoshop, and Quark 6.0. I learned Quark using version 3.0 back many moons ago. I have another ""inDesign"" book that is way too big and complicated then I remembered the Visual Quickstart. They are amazing books and are easy to use. I just wish InDesign was easier to used like Quark. The only reason I', using InDesign rather Then Quark is I just switched to a Mac and I didnt have Quark for the Mac. But the book is GREAT"
5,Great series!!,I loved this series!! Tired of hearing that yet?! So glad my friend introduced me to these books! Happy reading!
3,holiday,I watch this movie every christmas eve and its a tradition for me. Gets boring half way through but its tradition
1,An Axe to Grind without Wood to Chop,"A very poorly written book with too many ""anonymous"" quotes. It seems that Freeman had something against ESPN with little to prove.ESPN: An Uncensored History is a tiring read. It doesn't flow and it is full of the writer's slant and opinion, shaping unsubstantiated rumors into a very leaky case. Freeman would be better served writing an article with some of the allegations that have been made, rather than trying to stretch a few innuenedos into an otherwise boring book.Also, it was too full of locker-room banter and crude jokes that he supposedly found. Why couldn't have just told the narrative about the rapid rise of this gigantic sports network?This is a bad piece of investigative work. Don't waste your time with it."
3,"If you're an ESPN junkie, you'll enjoy it.....","If you have spent years watching nearly every Sportscenter as I have, then you will love learning about the history of the network and its personalities. But to be honest, I thought the early chapters moved slowly and there were ambiguous parts where it was hard to tell what was fact and what was the author's version of the events. I also agree with an earlier review that it is a bit presumptuous to state that certain reporters and anchors are ""the best"" talent, reporters, etc....However, like I said, if you can't get enough of the network(s), the magazine, and the Web site, then this is a quick read and an enjoyable one."
1,Did the author actually check facts?,"How much of ESPN's history can Freeman botch and still publish a book? Quite a bit, it seems. An author who writes about a sports network should at least know the difference between various leagues, especially the difference between major and minor leagues and which teams are in which."
1,Poorly done,"I was hoping for a good historical novel about an event that had great inpact on the history of the region. This is not the novel to read if you hope for historical accuracy! There are many inaccuracies which not even literary license can allow. Also, his style shows that this is a first novel. Perhaps he'll get better in the future or perhaps he'll stick to the practice of medicine!"
4,seduction of a sexy surfer,a really nice little film. good looking young men in good positions.you will enjoy
1,Camp X by David Stafford,"It is sad that Mr. Stafford has refused to accept historical fact and write such a lame account of one of the Second World Wars' greatest secrets. His exclusion of the role that Sir William Stephenson played is abhorrant. Through regular research and historical fact, anyone can determine that Intrepid was the key figure in Allied secret warfare during World War II. Through his offices at B.S.C., he controlled virtually all Allied intelligence."
5,political science major in minority rights and womens rights,"This is my passion. I read everything I can possibly get my hands on with this kind of stuff. Tavris's writing style is brilliant. The way she gets her point accross with sarcasim, statistics, and personal examples makes this book reach out to so many different groups of people. I love her non-male-bashing ways, her demonstrations of bias and scandles in both the medical industry and with scientist and biologist. Even if you don't agree with all her points, which not even I do, she makes a point in her book saying that these are her thoughts even though they might not be right or agreed upon by others, either."
3,Not what I expected,I ordered this DVD because Martin Clunes was featured. Of the three offerings only one was worthwhile. Save your money on this one and order Doc Martin or William and Mary instead.
2,Different.,"...But just because it is different doesn't necessarily mean it's good. There is a thin line between revolutionary fiction (as the author describes his work, in his own novel) and absolute crap. While it may be harsh to say it is the latter, it's certainly very far from the former. It seemed more like a personal diary than a cohesive novel. Dense reading? I agree it was difficult read but you surely do not have to go any slower while reading the book because seriously, you won't be missing much if you didn't. You could pretty much skip pages and pages, and even chapters, of random insignificant encounters and countless dull descriptions of the environments without losing anything if you read every page.Different? Yes. Revolutionary, I strongly disagree."
2,"A laborious journey, with no end in sight","Having seen the glowing reviews and the ""Nobel Prize"" stamp on the book cover, I wasn't necessarily expecting an easy read, but a rewarding one. About a third of the way through, I am finding this book nearly unreadable. Much has been made of the different narrative voices used, and indeed the ""I"" and ""You"" perspectives invite the reader to experience the author's journey in different ways. Unfortunately, the author saddles ""You"" with a very annoying companion in the form of ""She,"" and has ""You"" tell her stories that I assume are adaptations of Chinese folk tales, but don't resonate much with this American reader. I give the book 2 stars instead of 1 because some of the ""I"" narrator's experiences are fairly interesting if overly repetitive, and because I suspect that some of my difficulty with the book stems from my own unfamiliarity with Chinese culture."
5,A journey of one's mind written with subtle religious tenor,"I read the Chinese version first and found much was lost in English translation. I think Soul Mountain could have been used by the author as a metaphore for the purest unpolluted conscience in everyone's heart because of this old Chinese saying ""ren ren you ge ling shan ta"". According to Zen teaching, the more eager one tries to grasp it, the more it eludes one's reach. Soul Mountain remains as one of my favorite books for it was so beautifully written in such a subtle, enigmatic, philosophical, and thought-provoking style. -- Xingzi"
3,"Full of gems, but dense reading","This book's greatest strength is that it is filled with gems of truths about human existence. What shows Xingjian's writing abilities best is how he makes an observation about how people behave and turn it into a universal human truth.However, finding those truths is not always easy. Some are stated, many are not. The point is that this book is incredibly dense, and very literary. Being a literary author myself, I appreciate that, but not all readers do. I recently taught this book to a class of college students and though they all read it, none understood what the book was trying to tell them -- and most of the class is pretty astute.I recommend this book to people who enjoy dense reading, books filled with meaning and human truths. If you're looking for a book to read in the sedan chair at the poolside, this is not likely your book."
4,"Compelling History, Well Told","This history has three things going for it: first,Kauffman gives just enough detail---unlike some histories that overwhelm the reader with names and dates and mind numbing detail, Kauffman stays with the main characters(for the most part) and lets them emerge as distinct and full bodied people---Booth,vain but with an actor's gift of persuasion; Stanton,hard as nails but who loved(not too strong a word) Lincoln; the various members of the plot, all sinister but with different agendas. Second, he deftly talks about how Lincoln went from the most hated man in 1860 America to the most beloved. Finally(and here is where the book excels)he describes how Booth came to realize that his act made Lincoln a saint,and vivdly portrays Booth's death which was as painful and drawn out as the President's. For lovers of trivia the Coda lets you know what happened to all the main characters."
3,Disappointing,"The author has clearly done an enormous amount of research. The first few chapters, with a minute-by-minute report of events surrounding Lincoln's assassination, are riveting. Yet what I miss is a hypothesis from the author about why Booth did what he did and to what extent his conspiracy had outside funding. There is much that can't be known unless more comes to light, of course, but it's not beyond the role of the historian to engage in some interpretation.And why oh why was this book published without a map or a series of maps? It was a challenge to follow Booth's trail with a modern atlas in one hand. Random House, you should be ashamed for not ponying up for a little cartography."
1,Buy something else,"This book has typos on nearly every page. They aren't just mispelled words but wrong numbers used in the equations and miscalculated equations. It has made studying confusing. There's also not a lot of verbage to explain the steps you go through to solve a problem. They also do strange things like typing ""3.2174 x 10"" to represent gravity.I bought the book from ASME's website and have emailed them complaining about the quality.If this book were proof-read and all the errors corrected I would rate it 3 or 4 stars.One good thing I can say about it is that I have gleaned some understanding and useful equations (but it's difficult to trust after seeing all the typos).Buy this book only if you have bought everything else out there."
3,This book was okay it was a little on the strange side.,This book was a little strange for me. This is because in a lot of the short stories there had no problem or solution which I have never read a book that didn't have a problem or solution. One of the short stories this boy's teacher told him to give this note to the teacher on the 15th floor. But there was no 15th floor and when the boy came back with the note the teacher said he had delivered the note. This book was a little bit strange for me that is why I think it should be a 3. Some of the stories were funny though. Like a girl had no use for her toes so she was trying to sell them for a nickel.
5,Sideways Stories from Wayside School,This story is about a weird mixed up school that was built thewrong way. That may be why all funny things happen at Waysideschool.Especiallyon the 13th floor. On the 13th floor there's Ms.Gorf who turns all of her students into apples. And there's Todd who always gets sent home early and John who can only read upside down and there's Sammy But he is really a dead rat. I love this story because there's some stuff that don't usually happen in our school. E ND
5,Can't you read the signs?,"This book is the best I've read out of 20 since Janurary 1st.Mr.Clayburgh starts you out with the very basics, (you might say training wheels) and stays along side of you to the very end....Chapter 8 explains the most important concepts you must throughly understand to be successful with his system. Absolutely no guesswork! I think he has raised the standard in writing abouttrading systems. I gladly await any new material he delivers in the future!"
4,Solid Book,"For the beginner or the person who needs a good introduction to IP networking, the book provides some solid fundamentals. Furthermore, it brings together all of the elements into a common framework for TCP/IP networking."
4,Linus Gets On His Soap Box!,"Overall I thought this book was a pretty good read. I really recomend this book for those who have yet to delve into the world of Linus Torvalds.For the most part the book is pretty autobiographical, you get some fun tid bits about his life and whatnot; however, a good portion of this book uses some pretty technical langauge, that for the reader who may not be to familiar with basic computer science issues may get lost in the book (Linus suggests for the reader who is not that savy with programming to skip that portion of the book, but that's probably the best part of the book).I think the big flaw of the book is that towards the end it just turns into one big rant... it is fun to read Linus' views on ""open source"" which are a bit surprizing.All and all, I'll recomend this to anyone who frequents slashdot."
2,As much as I like Linus...,"This book is hastily written and poorly crafted. You may find useful information or get a good feeling for who Linus is, but this is not great literature by any stretch."
2,Delightful,The book is easy to read and has many interesting anecdotes about the first years of Linux. It is interesting to Linus fans and historians.
3,"An interesting book, but poorly organized","I thought this book was a very interesting read... it gives personal insight to Linus Torvalds and the process that went into the creation of Linux. The personal anecdotes left me with a better understand of who Linus Torvalds is. However, the book repeats much of it's information two or three times. The same analogies were used over and over again to illustrate the same point."
3,Gift for Grandson,"My three and a half year old grandson is now into Star Wars. He hasn't seen the movies, but likes the characters. He said he wanted the Binks figure. We bought it and he likes it. It was reasonably priced and arrived in new condition."
5,Excellent Book,"I too, ordered this book after hearing William Lamb on the radio.And after seeing his website, I called him for a personal reading.I could not belive what i was hearing! He told me about everything that was going on in my life.What a help and inspiration it was.I have told all my friends and family about this man.He is GOD-LIKE!"
2,Not for Everyone,"After using great teachers like Baron Baptiste and Total Yoga with Tracy Rich and Ganga White, this tape is in the bottom of my DVD pile, While the flow series is good, the middle of the tape is way to hard for most people and there is no instructions like with Baptiste, I spent more time trying to see what they were doing on the workout. With all my other DVD tapes I can follow the workout without having to look over at the screen."
1,Overwhelmed!,"I am overwhelmed with every book marketing book and person there is. Some don't even write clearly and succinctly. I don't have time, and the books cover far too much information. Can't anyone write an ""Easy Bookmarketing"" book, like I did for homeschooling (EasyHomeschooling Techniques)? Can't anyone just give some basic 1, 2, 3 steps about the very most important money making ideas? Is it really this hard and this complicated?! I would like to see a thin book that only includes what's absolutely necessary. I have several responsibilites and like I said, I just don't have time! I even tore my books up into chapters thinking that would help but the whole system is disorganized. I don't like to hear about other people's experiences or be included in a book for big publishers - leave out the filler. I feel the same way about all other book marketing books I've had."
4,Something for Everyone Who Publishes,"You don't even have to be a book author or publisher to use the hundreds of tips outlined in Jump Start Your Book Sales. As a newsletter publisher, I found the web sites listed in the book to be invaluable worth the price of the book alone! Authors I work with tell me their publishers aren't doing enough (anything!) to promote their books - I will be giving this book as a gift!!!"
5,I have been Jump Started!!!!,"As a Director of Marketing, I found this book to be a real gem. This information transfers to all area's of marketing. It gave me a bold perspective of how-to, which empowered me to go and creatively encourage & pursue clients like never before. Thanks to the Rosses, they held back nothing and put it all out there so everyone can benefit."
2,Might as-well have a cord,The range on the IR is I would say 2 ft. I couldn't find specs or even the model on Belkins webstie. I did a web search and found the manual and it wasn't even the same setup as what comes in the box.It's on it's way back home...
2,Future time,"This book assumes you are looking to the future using the book of Revelation in the Bible. If you like to predict the future you might enjoy using this analysis of the book of Revelation to predict the future. I was looking for a book that treats the book of Revelation as historical. What did St. John say about the end time? How do these disguised references fit with what St. John wrote before? So, the perspective was wrong for what I wanted."
3,As advertised,"This book is good, but not as good as the first. I think it has some of the ads that are more obscure."
2,still disappointing,"Perhaps some of your reviewers are not familiar with Homer's Odyssey, on which this movie is based. Cold Mountain tells us little about the Civil War, just as the Odyssey tells us little about the Trojan War (that was in the Iliad, the basis of another recent movie). The parallelism between CM and the Odyssey is lame and stilted, even down to some tacky Sirens! Odysseus finally arrives home to confront his wife's suitors, just as Inman does. The Odyssey tells us little about Odysseus' relation to his wife, so it is hardly surprising that the relationship between Inman and Ada in CM is a blank. It may have seemed a good idea to turn the Odyssey into CM; but the result is disappointing."
4,Happy,I am very happy with my purchase. I have always been very happy with my purchases from Amazon.com
2,Zellweger is fine; but what was Nicole thinking???,"Nicole Kidman looks as if she is modeling for some fashion magazine. Her acting is subpar in Anthony Minghella's 'Cold Mountain'. Renee Zellweger is first rate, but is on screen far too little. Jude Law is also fine, but has very little to say, so I didn't really get to know him. When we finally do get to see the payoff, it is predictable and disappointing. Much of the action on screen, though impressive, was far too violent (for violence's sake) and sporadic. The movie was unfocused. Because Minghella failed to introduce his characters properly (even the three leads), I didn't feel for anyone who lived or died, good guys or bad. Donald Sutherland was wasted. It isn't one of the best movies of the year, it's one of the worst. Like Minghella's other films, 'The English Patient' and especially the horrible 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', 'Cold Mountain' left me cold."
3,Not bad,Not great. A movie for a slow night. The cameos were more interesting than a lot of the movie.
5,satisfied customer,I was happy with my order. The video loaded quickly and the quality was good. I would recommend this movie
4,Cold Mountain - 102-4169849-9449760,"Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand."
5,wonderful movie,I saw this movie when it first came out but I decided that I needed to own this film so I also bought it. It's wonderful as I love movies in that time era but it's just flat out an excellent movie that is very believable. The music is excellent as well and it's a must watch for anyone who loves that time era. Renee Zellweger is my favorite character in this film as she plays an interesting part.
3,The American Patient?,"The same crew that brought us ""The English Patient"" brings us ""Cold Mountain,"" for better or worse. There is a similar gauzy look and air of unreality about the film. That doesn't diminish some fine acting, especially from Renee Zellweger.You've probably already heard that she steals the film, but that's not quite so. There are fine supporting performances, notably from Donald Sutherland, as Kidman's soon-to-expire dad.The film is faithful to the plot of the book, except in the portrayal of Inman (Jude Law) who is mature, competent, and enigmatic in print but a bumbling, callow youth on-screen. Still, except for the director and producers seeing a need to beat everyone to death with ""war is bad, war is bad"" rather than leave Charles Frazier's accurate history intact, the plot is gripping.On the whole, a good, albeit not great film. See it, but no need to rush to do so."
5,Adam Levine's best,This is the best compilation Maroon 5 has ever done. Every song is worth listening to. I loved it so much that I had to go on the Internet to find out more about the Jane who inspired the album.
2,A little lacking,"As much as I'd hate to knock any Bible, this one was not all I expected it to be. It's not any type of devotional bible with commentary and discussion. It is a regular Bible with a leather cover with a little police shield on it. It has some interesting articles in the back, however. If you want a small handy bible to place in your duty bag, then by all means buy this one. But if your looking for a daily bible with note geared for police officers as I was pass this one up."
4,a must for every art student,"art since 1940 is a well researched and methodically presented book on contemorary art and art makers. the introduction and opening chapters deal with movements such as surrealism and are a very good lead up into the art after 1940. the author has dealt with various movements and expanded on specific artists from each of these phases in art. one does feel however that the portions on certain artists were sketchier than others, especially with regards to the visual material provided. also the book could have been planned better in terms of the placement of photographs along with the corresponding text. All in all, however, as an art student, I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who ever wondered what all that 'thrown about paint'in jackson pollock's work was all about. The life history of the artists was well researched and wasnt superficial like a lot of books on art and provided a valuable insight into the art work itself."
3,Star Wars!,"I bought this for my little brother around Christmas. He's a fan of Star Wars and he really seemed to like these. They come with little lightsabers and you can pose them, just like most other action figures. I can't really find anything wrong with this. You get what you buy."
3,"Entertaining, but not ""The True Story""","The movie was filled with several notable celebrities, and lots of elaborate sets. The adaptation has little resemblance to Mary Shelley's novel. Without going into specifics about the inaccuracies, suffice it to say that this is a movie to be watched purely for entertainment."
4,Very good Frankenstein...,I saw this back in the 70's when it was first televised and loved it. Would love to see this on DVD in Widescreen!!
1,Not as faithful as people seem to think,"Do not let this one fool you. This NOT a faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel. The very idea that the Frankenstein creature is decomposing contradicts that the creature was given life. He's alive, not just reanimated dead tissue, that's a major point in the story. It's a disappointing and senseless twist that is completely unnecessary. If you want a version of Frankenstein that actually follows Mary Shelley's novel check out the version produced by Hallmark and released to DVD by Lion's Gate starring Luke Goss as the creature. That mini-series version of Frankenstein from 2004 is the most faithful to the book."
1,Worst Frankenstein movie,1. This movie has NOTHING To do with the actual novel.2. This movie is a ridiculous invention in which Henry is the creator.3. This movie even upset my 11 year old son.
3,Good book by Weber but pricey,"As a photographer who really looks up to and loves the work of Bruce Weber, I know I have a strong bias for anything he does. However, this book is a great look inside Weber's world and is godo with the interviews as well. My only problem is the price, ... there are probably better books for those that really get into Weber photography and are looking to maybe buy just one book, such as the out of print Chop Suey Club, etc., that even cover his work with Abercrombie and Fitch, and are cheaper at the same time. I would only recommend this book for someone who wants to know more than your basics about what Weber is about, and price is not an issue, otherwise go for it!"
3,B. Weber revolutionized the meaning of poor images into arts,"As with most of Bruce Weber's books, his style is the same from the beginning and had not changed a bit. Though I admire many of his good works (and in fact had purchased a lot of his expensive books), a good 70% of images in his books were the same type of images we discard at photo school developing labs and the same type of images our instructors at Photo 1 asked us to improve. Reasons: out of focus, bad composition, low quality grainy and muddy images. Well, it's the name that sells, you know. It takes a lot to be Bruce Weber. Honestly, his works for Abercrombie and Fitch were much better than the books. If I were to make a name like my idol, my works will sell, as well. And I am not kidding."
5,Bosnians--Book graphically depicts people and effects of war.,I visited Sarajevo recently with former refugee student who now resides in Canada. The visit was a graphic depiction of how the Bosnians suffered and still suffer now so many years after the Dayton Accords. The book The Bosnians readily depicts in fotos the results of this tragic series of events and allows the reader to feel and empathize with the people affected by this tragic and genocidal war.
1,The very late book that never arrived,I ordered the book on 11-20-08.Amazon.com told me it would be 4-16 days to delivery.Its been 32 days and still no book.I asked the seller for a refund.They said I would have to return it and it takes as long to return as it took for it to arrive.They wanted to discourage me from returning it if it ever arrives.I ordered several hundreds dollars of products from amazon.com last xmas.This year $O because I have lost over $40.00 dollars on a book I no longer need.I will never order from the seller again and may never do business with amazon.com again.
3,Unfolds like a B-grade movie,"As I was reading Shattered, I kept envisioning the book being made into a B movie. I could picture the scene changes, particularly those that involve ""the relationship,"" which seemed not to add much to the plot, and the awkward dialog. I am a Dick Francis fan, and as another reviewer said, I await his books. I enjoyed reading this one, but it was not up to his usual standard."
3,Marigolds & Bon-Bons,"This is only my 2nd Francis' novel. I liked it overall--engaging characters, difficult mystery (though enough clues ARE provided to figure out who the 4th attacker was & who had the tape), very interesting explanations of glass making, & some excitement as well. The connection to horseracing is small, but so what? I especially liked the dynamic among Logan & his assistants as well as his protectors. I think the book is only worth 3.5 stars because of the hard-to-believe ending & Logan's unexplained reticence to involve the police--when he'd recognized some of his attackers--and his girlfriend is a constable. Though sometimes intelligent people do dumb things. Rose was a bit difficult to believe as well. On the other hand, his supporting cast is a trip, especially Marigold, Bon-Bon, & Worthington."
2,One of his weaker efforts,"I've read and enjoyed almost all of Mr. Francis' books but ""Shattered"" is perhaps his weakest effort. The plot was contrived and hard to follow and the motivations and actions of the main character were hard to understand. The writing style of this book was also different from his prior books. If Dick Francis' name wasn't on the book cover, I would have thought someone else wrote it."
5,A picture is worth...,"How many of you remember doing geometry proofs in High School? How many of you enjoyed writing them? I don't know about you but I've always preferred pictures to words when it comes to understanding how something works.This is a wonderful book that provides visual insights into how one might go about proving mathematical theorems. The Pythagorean Theorem has always been a mystery to me. How are the squares of the sides of a right triangle related to its hypotenuse? ""Proof Without Words"" has five clever illustrations that guide readers in writing their own proofs.If you ever doubted that algebra and geometry were related, the diagrams demonstrating how to compute sums of series will produce aha! experiences.Writing proofs when one is guided by visual cues is a much more fulfilling endeavor than stringing together dry facts from memory. This book delivers much fulfillment in exploring theorems in geometry, algebra, trigonometry, sequences, and other aspects of Math."
2,So so,"I had great expectations and found this book superficial. One gets the feeling this is more a vocabulary book rather than an in-depth study on this complex subject. Cases are one-page long each and take you too rapidly to a conclusion without detailed arguments and facts. The ""Value Dynamics"" framework proposed by the authors does give you an approach for the orderly incorporation of often-ignored drivers of value such as culture and structure, but again the book is more focused on the ""what"" rather than the ""how""."
1,it broke the first day,We ordered several pieces of sound type equipment and was pleased with all but this piece. My son went to attach his mic and it snapped and broke.Will have to order another more sturdy piece.Bummed as it was part of his completing his system.
4,"Professional victims, do not listen","Professional victims and elitist scholars do not listen to the work ofthese two pioneering women. But if you have a chronic illness like I do(multiple sclerosis) or if you are a health care professional (RN)then you need to INHALE the work of these two women because someday youare going to be hearing Dr. Oz talk like this on Oprah and think it isnew stuff...You need this and ""Intuitive Listening"" and ""The New FeminineBrain"" and the book on menopause. Ladies, wake up. It is the 21st century and we are in charge of our lives and our health and happiness.Don't shut down that marvelous right brain of yours!!! USE IT>GREAT STUFF"
1,Igniting Intuition,"I can't believe I spent money on this nonsense I'm very disappointed in my purchase. Christine and Lisa pretty much sat around and story swap(very boring). Worse, I couldn't even get thru CD 2 because the amount of male bashing these two women were doing made me sick to my stomach. Don't waste your money."
1,Terrible sound quality...how could they do this?,"I love almost all of the artists here (except for Eartha Kitt and Lena Horne), but I just can't stand these little 'Golden Legends' discs. They are disgraceful. The sound quality is just so bad on all of them.I am getting really irritated with these discs. As I've stated in previous reviews, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH MADACY! Why don't they just let the artists' OFFICIAL record companies handle these releases?And this isn't the first time Madacy have been ripoffs. On almost all of their discs, they make no effort whatsoever to clean these discs up!There's a reason why all of these 'Golden Legends' CDs are so cheap. DO NOT get suckered into buying these.Overall, do yourself a favor and buy a quality 'ladies of jazz' CD. But do not buy this one. The sound quality is just terrible.NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,I read better books,This book really really really really really really really really really really really realy really really really really really really really Stinks.
1,Just awful,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. To begin with, it butchers a classic book -- my kids were appalled when Frightful the falcon was killed. But beyond that, everything about it is just awful -- screenplay, acting, direction, music, dream sequence(!) Totally amateur, not one entertaining minute in the picture. Negative five stars."
2,Disappointing,"The book was wonderful, so I had high hopes for the movie. Unfortunately, it strayed from the book quite a bit.For example, in the book, Sam went to the mountains of New York - in the movie, he went to Quebec.He had a pet raccoon (Gus), which was not in the book either. Worst of all, Frightful (his falcon) was shot/killed about half way through the movie!"
2,Don't Try This At Home,"I understand that the book version of this is a classic story, and much more worthwhile. This video is watchable because of the breathtaking scenery; otherwise, the messages sent to the viewer are downright bizarre. Made in 1969, and reflective of the era.Here are some of the film's messages: A) If you're a 13-year-old aspiring biologist and your parents just don't understand you, then you should run away from home to live in the wilderness (No!). (B) It is okay to deliberately set fire to an ancient tree (No!) (C) If a burly guy discovers your secluded campsite, you should invite him to stay and share your sleeping quarters (NO, NO, a thousand times, NO! Good grief, what were they thinking?!) Plan on reading the novel and skipping this video."
1,musty and moldy,"Even though I bought this book used and was not expecting perfection I had to throw the book away. The book had a horrific musty and moldy odor. Also, several of the pages had mold spots. I would not use this vendor again."
4,Seascape painting techniques,"Rachel R Wolf used a simple approach to deal with the painiting of the seascape. Not only the painiting of the sea is dealt with but the items that interact with the sea are also discussed. Items like boats, shorelines, people, animals, birds etc that compose the picture are discussed.Mix media are also explored in the book. The autheor used different media like water colour, oil ink and pastel to illustrate how to bring out the mood for the various coposition. It also discuss how some of the tips to help overcome mistakes and mask its effects."
4,Happy Hours,"This book is a ""must read"" for every young woman. The book is intelligent, an easy read and deals with the subject of women and alcoholism in a realistic and credible fashion."
3,An enjoyable and quick read.,"This book answered the question: how did Jim and Artie meet? I have always wondered, and this book provided a logical and satisfing answer. The plot moves swiftly and effectivly blends fact with fiction. Although I enjoyed the book, I did feel that it missed a certain flavor that would have made the book ""authentic"" Wild, Wild West. James West seems a little more rough-necked than the TV version. I always viewed James West as a 19th century James Bond. Here, he is more like Dirty Harry. He is tough but not cool. I think that Artie is well charaterized. All in all, I think WWW fans will enjoy the book. It is the first new WWW story in a decade so who can complain? As an aside, I want to send kudos to the cover designer, Steven Ferlauto. He really captured the flavor of a paperback TV tie-in from the 60s. Well done, Steve!"
2,Unreliable Recipes,"I regret purchasing this book. Okay, I must admit that the raspberry cream cheese coffee cake was beyond fabulous, and I have made it repeatedly, even in a triple batch for a large crowd at an official function. However, I have had more disappointment than satisfaction when trying other recipes in this book. The yellow cake, for example, was absolutely horrible. My husband and I each took a bite or two from our first (and only) slices of that cake, and promptly threw away not only the remainder of our slices, but the entire rest of the cake as well. Also, I did not like the blueberry muffins. I have tried literally dozens of blueberry muffin recipes over the years, searching for the perfect one, and this recipe ranked low on the list. I found the shortbread recipe only mediocre. So, while there may be other excellent recipes in this book, I am reluctant to try any more, because I don't want to waste my time (and ingredients) on recipes from an unreliable source."
3,A Superficial Account.,"This is a very good summary rehash of information regarding this nightmarish crime, but somehow it seems lacking in depth, insight, and a broader perspective. In light of events in Columbine, Jonesboro, Paduka, etc., and as our collective consciousness rises with greater understanding of the consequences of unfettered dysfunction in families, mixed with the indifference of the large, penal-like institutions we call secondary schools, it's only a wonder that even more tragedies like this one are not occurring. May the soul of poor Shanda rest in peace. And hopefully her four murderers can do some good within the confines of prison. Let's only hope that's where they remain."
1,WRITTEN HORRIBLY,"THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN HORRIBLY, SORRY STICK TO UR TV PROGRAMTHE DETAILS OF MURDER THE BEGINNING OF STORY WAS SO STUPIDMURDER DETAILS SHOULD BE MID BOOK HELLO"
4,Aphrodite Jones is one of the best true crime writers...,"I have read so many true crime books and Jones' remain the most readable and interesting to date. This one is a page-turner. Straightforward and not laden with personal commentary like so many in the genre, I read this in one sitting."
2,Egh so so,"Focuses too much on the other girls. I could careless what kind of upbringing they had. Am I supposed to feel sorry for them? My sympathy goes directly to Shanda and her family, not those psychotic b!tches."
3,Cruel Sacrifice- a powerful book,"When i first started to read Cruel Sacrifice i couldn't put it down. The things the Loveless family had to endure, it would make anyone cry. The torture the little girls were put through by their own father were horrible, and Aphrodite Jones has written the book so well that you could almost feel the breath of the drunk man on your neck. She really takes you into the book itself with her and shows you all the details of the incident. I would recomend this book to anyone of the age of thirteen and older, and I would read it again. This book is very powerful with the way you think. After i read half of the book i started to really appreciate my family a little more and really think, this happens everyday. It is a great book."
2,Haven't read it yet.,haven't had time to read it. I hate to write reviews so I can't really say much about a book that I have never read
3,"Great music, well recorded",This album features one of my favorite songs 'Let beauty awake'. Williams treats this collection of songs with a delicate passion that transcends the music. The weariness of the wayfaring traveller is conveyed perfectly.
3,Retribution Road a so so Movie,I bought the Movie for a good price . I am a fan of good Drama-Actoin flicks but this novie was too slow and the acting was not what I expected leavine me disappointed. I stopped the movie after the first 45 min..
1,A Book in Fragments,"As a prolific reader of history, I found this book to be a tremendous diappointment. There is no coherence to this project. It is pieces of history and the same oft-quoted statistics slapped together - a poor condensation of Keegan's various books, Ferguson's The Pity of War and Kershaw's Hitler. Read any of these, but not Vinen's. Yes history is messy, but writing about it shouldn't be."
2,Book of Nonsense,"Dont waste your money on this silly little book. There is no real information in it. For example, It says real Cariocas are under 40 years old. What rubbish. I'm not sure the author has ever been to the beach here.If anyone in Rio wants my copy, you can have it for free!"
5,"ESTA SITUACI""N ATERRADORA","Es más común de lo que nos imaginamos...De alguna manera, la esposa acaba odiando al marido por su autoritarismo, por su falta de sensibilidad o por su absoluta sordera emnocional...¡Y SIGUE A SU LADO !¿Qué la detiene ?¿Le tiene miedo?¿No se siente autosuficiente ?Este es el libro que analiza la relación, le devuelve a la mujer su autoestima y su seguridad en si misma..Y LA HACE LIBRE POR DENTRO PARA CONTINUAR EL MATRIMONIO, O LA AYUDA A TOMAR LA DECISIÓN DE LIBERARSE !¡MAGNÍFICO !"
3,"Strong on issues, weak in depth","A pretty good book if you are not very familiar with security issues. It has a very good introductory on threat modeling concepts from software engineering point of view.It does a good job alerting developers of potential risks in their day-to-day coding practices. Although this is achieved somtimes through blatant bluff.When it comes down to the hardcore issues, the book just scratches the surface most of the time.A typical software product manager's writing with some technical touch. This is said because of the quality of the sample code presented. If you have read Jeffrey Ritchter's book, you know what I mean."
4,Good reference for Securing Microsoft Application Development.,"I am happy with this book, it helped me quickly with all possible security options with Microsoft C++ and little bit of .NET framework. The book drills well enough on the Microsoft specific implementation guidelines for authentication, authorization, cryptographic options, database connectivity etc. It helps most part, but the book is weak on security options related to XML Web services particularly technologies related to WS-Security and Passport (Identity federation options). I am not a Microsoft developer so I do understand the security holes with every Microsoft application..(never heard of a Java virus), so I always wondered why the authors did'nt suggest to secure their own applications from redmond. If you are a C# developer, I am sure you will like it...and it certainly worth a buy."
2,Not so much for web programming security,I have bought this book hoping to write a secure web page but I could get more advice search the microsoft web page than the book. Not recommended if you r writing for the web.
4,Sheer Delight!!!,"I have always enjoyed Charles Aznavour and simply adore Liza Minnelli. Neither artists disappointed me on this DVD - they are both magnificent. I don't speak French and although I was caught up with Aznavour's charm, talent and music I so wished I knew what he was saying so that I could also cry and laugh with him. I've added 'Learn French' to my life-list.Liza always lifts my spirits and find myself grinning from ear-to-ear. The song I liked the least was 'God bless the child' and I can't explain why. My favourite was ""I love a Piano"". Liza is superb in this one!!! The reason why I enjoy Liza is because she gives her all in every song. How can one not love her when her 'all' is absolute talent that thrills one through and through.The medley is a joy because, not only are the songs wonderful, but the love and respect between the two artists just shines through and lifted my heart as it will do yours.Bravo my friends."
3,Meets expectation,"Its better to actually ""do"" stuff than to read about it, that being said, book provides some helpful information on close combat, a couple of paragraphs missing, but nothing major, as title says manual meets the expectation, that is why gets 3 stars."
1,Post LINE pre MCMAP,"First it is important to put this book in perspective. It was written after the Marine Corps had dropped the LINE system as not preparing Marines for the demands of the modern battlefield and before the creation and adoption of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). It was also written before any lessons could be learned from the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is a very simple book with a set of basic techniques that may not be the most important to learn first.The rest is simply my opinion so take it for what it is worth. The Marine Corps is full of very tough people. They are not tough because their hand-to-hand combat training is good. In fact, I would argue that their hand-to-hand combat training can be pretty crappy and the average Marine will still be pretty tough. This manual falls into that catagory.If you want to be tough like a Marine, join the Corps. You will certainly not learn how to fight like a Marine by practicing the techniques in this book."
4,Historical,This book is well organized and the material is well presented. It is vintage in technical description as some methods today have been modified significantly which you will notice if you take Judo for example. But the information is still very relevant and a great read. It does pull together a number of areas that are interesting and helps identify what is important to the warrior compared to modern day Judo players. In Judo one would learn and hear the comments presented but the shift in priority to understand the level of importance to the war fighter is well done.
5,Buttkicker LFE Kit is awesome,"I purchase the Buttkicker LFE Kit along with the wireless transmitter. I have a four piece section (L shaped) and was told I'd need multiple LFE's to feel it in all seats. I installed the mounting plate under two legs (vs one as the instructions suggest) and pushed all seats as tight as I could. I purchased enough of the rubber isolators to fit under all the legs on the sectional. Man oh man is this thing powerful. You have to play with a bit to find the sweet spot, but I feel the movement from all four pieces of my sectional. Absolutely amazing! Watching King Kong is a thrill. As for the wireless kit, it works like a dream and not having to run wires everywhere was even better."
2,Not Worth the Money,"Powers off automatically and doesn't remember tare setting, so for constant monitoring it is a major pain. It's significantly less useful than a $10 bathroom scale. Overall this is overpriced junk, don't buy it."
3,Functional.,"For the amount of weight allowed on the scale, I wish the surface to place the items on was a bit larger. Also, it is a little inaccurate, by a few ounces. I once measured something on this scale and took it to the post office and it ended up being heavier than expected and I had to pay more. It's not terrible though. Easy to use."
5,Great quality scale,Awesome scale. Works great for everyday weights. Would reccomend this scale and company to anyone. Looks and works great for the money.
5,LOVE THESE SHOES,"THESE SHOES MAYBE DONT HELP MY SON JUMP HIGHER, BUT THEY ARE MADE REALLY WELL AND STURDIER THAN MOST"
1,Simply dreadful... half a star.,"As a Senior Financial Advisor of this country&#65533;s largest brokerage house, Registered Investment Advisor, and previously a University Professor for over 20 years, I found this book purely dreadful. The ""Five Steps to a Successful Exercise Strategy"" and Case Studies that Mr. Ungar and Mr. Sakanashi wrote were worse than some turned in my by my first year students. ""Your Employee Stock Options"" may have helped a minority of the readers (some very suspiciously skewed reviews here) who lacked the good sense to call their accountant or financial consultant. And for &#65533;Chicago&#65533; who suggests cashing in their options &#65533;now&#65533; rather than when they might have had some value? Does &#65533;absurdity&#65533; mean anything to you?Do a search for &#65533;Stock Options&#65533; here on Amazon. You&#65533;ll find many choices, all better than this one. Believe me, I&#65533;ve read nearly every one of them."
3,It was okay,"This video was okay...I mean, the basic premise is that of a few other videos out there...it's okay to be sexy. That in itself is great.This video is too similar in alot of ways to The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women, which is one of my favorites and I've had for years! It just isn't as good.Yes, I was disappointed. I suppose I learned a little bit more than I already knew but it wasn't worth the $20+ ."
4,pat benatar vol.2,"all of her greatest hits,the cd is awsome sounds fantastic,one of the greatesat collections put together."
5,They ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've got nineteen Webkinz and they all ROCK. Everyone wants more and more. I don't think this trend will ever die. Ganz company makes millions of dollars every week, allowing them to continue their fragile but fun business. Every day, more markets demand an extra order of Webkinz to sell. Toy companies try to compete with these master-peices of fun, but none have succeeded. That brings us to 'Shining Stars'. I have two and they're awesome. BUT, I MUST admit, Webkinz last longer and they are more accurate. Ganz makes more money than ever every year, and, with that money, they are able to make wonderous expansions to their fabulous website otherwise known as 'Webkinz World'."
5,Hit the spot!,The Webkinz Black Lab was a gift for my 6 year-old grandson. It is his reminder of the family lab that passed away earlier in the year. The toy dog turned out to be his favorite Christmas present. He carries it with him everywhere.
3,Not as complete as you think...,"The complete book of Pasta and Noodles is a comprehensive and focuses on Italian pastas. In the back it hosts several recipes for rice noodles--the reason I purchased this book. Problem is that there a several recipes and details about how to make all kinds of pasta, however, none for rice noodles.Basically, this book describes how to purchase rice/asian noodles, and what to look for. There are no recipes on how to make them yourself. You have to purchase the noodles at a store and then use this book to complete the meal.I purchased this book because my neighbor cannot eat any wheat products and this book should have one recipe and doesn't."
5,Excellent book...,"I like that the basic principal sauces are covered and then deviated from. Really nice recipes and comprehensive instructions. The taste testing of recipes is covered also, so you hear why they did it this way, or used / didn't use a specific ingredient.Wonderful book."
5,Pasta Book,"Not enough recipes to make the noodles and pasta; mostly on texures. Otherwise, great book. This is not a recipe book."
4,Great Behind-the-Scenes look at how Chrysler capitulated,"An excellent and captivating look at the behind-the-scenes machinations that would ultimately result in Detroit only being a domestic Big Two.The book is slightly lopsided, with perhaps excessive exposition on the Kerkorian takeover efforts and ending with somewhat compressed detail on the post-Daimler acquisition troubles.Ranks with ""Comeback"" and Car"" as recent great reads about the people and events that shaped and are shaping today's automotive landscape. A good read read for general readers and plainly wonderful for auto industry enthusiasts and/or professionals."
3,"Heart and soul, with depths","This is a thoughtful and carefully put-together book with a story that touches you on many levels. Its weakness is trying too hard to be literary, and you never really forget there's an author pulling the levers. But it's definitely worth reading."
1,What a Rip Off!,"Poor picture quality was just the first problem with this documentary. The information is misleading, and in some places, down right incorrect. The quotes are taken out of context to make Hitler seems as evil as possible. Do not buy this video."
5,Just like the title says - very smooth,"This album is a must for true lovers of contemporary solo piano. My true test of an album of this nature is if the tunes ""resonate"" in my mind after having listened one time. The album passed with flying colors. Two tracks in particular are exceptional in my mind - the title track and ""Taking the Back Roads"" This is very dynamic and passionate playing without the backround clutter that is typical of other artists. Mr. Gray never overplays and ""crowds the piece"" Very few players have ability to take a single instrument and create the fullness that can satisfy my musical cravings. This CD does very well in that respect. My 5 year old daughter asks for Smooth Water in lieu of Raffi. That says something about the age appeal of Mr. Gray's brand of play."
5,Wonderful learning in this book,This book taught me so much and is easy to read and understand. I think everyone should read it.
3,OK; Could have been better,"Lord Rossley saved Diana March from a watery death in the Thames. Too bad you heard so very little of that part of the story. That would have made the book interesting. What happened at that point -- what made him save her and make her the guardian of his child? Instead you just find out that perfect Diana has made his house a home and his child a wonderful mother. Now he has returned from war rather than dying and now what kind of a life will they have. Diana decides she loves him and sets out to make him notice and love her. Of course there is a happy ending but it was a little too cut and dried. The daugher ""Melly"" was a nice touch. Quick read --"
2,Very comfortable but too tight around the calf,"As other reviewers have noted, these boots are well constructed and are very comfortable on the feet however they grip the calf and it becomes very uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear. I am a thin woman, 5'5 so I didn't think I would have a problem but I had to return. Ordering a larger size wouldn't work as they fit very true to size in the foot. If you have thin calves, I think these rainboots would be perfect."
5,THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE,"If you have had the desire to read the books of the Bible and haven't been sucessful, this book is a must. Pam gives you suggestions and options as to how to accomplish it. She knows the barriers that have prevented us from reaching our goal as she has been there too. She categorizes the books in the Old Testament under Law, History, Poetry/Wisdom Literature and Prophesy and in the New Testament under he Gospels, Epistles (letters) and Prophesy. She tells you if they are easy, moderate or difficult reading which really helped me to decide where I needed to start. She has really motivated me and I know that I will suceed this time. God has blessed her with such wisdom and I am so grateful she has shared it with her readers in such an honest way. It is a book that you will always come back to."
3,This movie was hard to watch,This movie was hard to watch cause i teach and i can feel the frustrations of the students and teachers
5,A Rough Watch But Excellent Film,Adrian Brody performs another spectacular lead role that turns the eye on the public school system and shows the complete breakdown of parents missing from their childrens lives and placing the responsibility on the teacher to raise their children for them. This movie doesn't pull any punches and shows kids at their worst and the fleeting hold on sanity the teachers have. There really aren't any feel good moments to be had and it shocks you into thought. I highly enjoyed it but be prepared for the melancholy of processing everything that happens as the movie is very graphic.
2,Not too good,i like Adrien Brody so i thought i would like this move but i did not. Did not like the story line
3,mediocre,"While A. Brody's performance was above average compared to most Hollywood actors, the movie was bleak much like the educators depicted in this movie. All of whom appeared to be either mentally unstable or troubled.Having worked in public schools in the inner city, suburbs, rural areas, on the east coast and the west coast, I can write with certitude SOME scenes are rather believable. For one, the educational system is in a state of disarray. SOME teachers are jaded, SOME caregivers are indifferent, and SOME students (and parents) are disrespectful.If a director wants to portray the negatives of public education in the United States of America, they will start with THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, and our OPEN BORDERS."
4,thought provoking,"At first the movie was a little slow so it took me two days to finish it, but after viewing it once I think I am going to view it again.This movie has so many meanings behind it.To the kids who don't care about school and think like these kids to the people who are out of school looking back at their school years.I'm starting to think about sending some flowers to my old schools or maybe anonymously donating some school supplies as a way of saying thank you for putting up with me(I was the quiet kid)"
5,Margaret Laurence is the mother of Canadian Litature!,"My last year of highschool we had to read The Stone Angel, and it was the only book assigned to me in highschool that I managed to finish ahead of sechduel. I have since been out of school for two years and when I found The Diviners I jumped at the chance to read it. And I loved it and everything about it, unlike the other reveiwers I was neither forced to read it nor was I looking for a book about a middle aged women to relate to. I read this book simply because Laurence is a great storyteller. She manages to wave the past and present flawlessly never losing the reader anywhere in between. I fond that the realisionship between Morag and Pique was much like the realisionship between Deliah and Cissy in Dorthy Alison's Cavedweller. So if you like The Cavedweller then you like this book. The same can be said for if you like Laurence's books you will Alison's books because she is the next step for Women's litature in North America!"
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I bought it based on the other reviews that said that it was for beginners but i was out of breath and i work out every day and i am not overweight either.It is NOT for beginners, I have several tae bo videos, I like some more than others but this one is too hard for me."
2,Wasn't that tough...,"Wasn't that tough. There were some tough moments, but overall, it was a pretty easy hour. A lot of explaining and setting up for a 30 second fast move."
2,key code ;(,i bought the game used and i couldnt use it because the key code was already active on someone elses computor so boooo i had to send it back
5,Perfect for small jobs,"I love Le Creuset enameled cast-iron cooking equipment. It works wonderfully and clean-up is pretty quick. I've had this piece for a month and have used it 4 times already. The ""precision pour"" lip lives up to its name as I could pour a thick sauce into a serving dish easily without making a mess. I purchased it during a promotional sale and it was a steal considering how useful it's been to me already."
5,Cooking is a pleasure......,"This is my second Le Creuset item. I like the fact that I can use lower heat to cook and it seems to spread the heat so evenly. The weight of this particular item makes it sit firm on my electric burner...a bit of safety factor, to me; and it goes through the dishwasher very well.Amazon offers some Le Creuset items at great prices. I'll be looking for my next piece."
4,"A good, fast read.","Brent Monahan's follow up to ""Book of Common Dread"" is as good as the original. Basically, its a tale between good and evil, human versus super human (Vampires) and the devil. Fast read, nothing too thought provoking though but occasionally, one starts to think, hey, yeah, that could happen! ="
5,Weaving the threads the memory_no one does it better,"Thomas H Cook weaves together the threads of memory to make a fabric, real and tangible, of events, place, people, and evidence.A Master."
1,Not his best work-,"I can't believe that this is the same author who wrote ""Evidence of Blood"" & ""Breakheart Hill"". I was very disappointed by this book. The main character was not likable & whereas in his other books, where the suspense just kept mounting until the very end, this book dragged so badly that I looked at the end to see if I wanted to read the whole thing. Read some of his other books instead!"
1,Problems with SanDisk Memory Sticks,"I had the same problem with 2 4GB SanDisk Memory Sticks. I took numerous photos with my Sony camera and everything was fine. I put the memory stick into my digital picture frame to view the photos I took, and they would not show on the frame. I put the stick back in the camera, and it would not work, I got a error message flashing C:13:01. I took the stick back to Radio Shack and they exchanged it, but I had the same trouble with the second stick. I have used the Sony Memory Sticks for years without an issue, but I will never buy a SanDisk stick again."
4,sandisk 1gb memory stick pro,It was a really good deal from amazon.i couldn't wait to buy it as i have been waiting for a deal like this for quite a while.
5,Great product,My son LOVES this set. He is a self proclaimed dinosaur expert at four and just loves getting into his bed at night!
4,Hungry for more,"To me, this book isn't great literature, but it's a great read.Some reviewers have found this book ponderous in its attention to technical detail yet scant on piercing insight into the human condition, but I personally think its straightforward narrative is its strength.Greenlaw is no Tolstoy, but she's handy with a turn of phrase. She describes a world so alien to most of us, so full of activity, and so completely demanding that I can't help but admire her for making the effort to write this book.I read a lot, and one of the reasons I read is to look into lives different from my own. This book definitely achieves that.In the future, I'll never take swordfish steaks for granted."
2,"disappointing, flat","I read this book because my 25-year old son is a commercial fisherman. He left school at 17 to go salmon fishing in Alaska. I still remember his descriptions of the glorious sunsets and the thrills he found in the day-to-day exposure to nature at her best and worst. I felt this book was very flat, all the boring day to day details with none of the excitement and special exposure to nature that fishermen are drawn to. Why else would they put up with all the negatives of this lifestyle?"
1,Why We Need To Protect Ocean Creatures.,"Let me quote. ""A 7-foot blue shark hung from the Hannah Boden's rigging, where it thrashed wildly. Swaddled in rags saturated in lighter fluid, the shark was slashed at with knives and poked with gaffs like a giant pinata until a single match set it ablaze. Slowly, the thrashing reduced to a writhing, and finally a squirm.""I don't think these people are professional fishermen. I think they are sociopaths, choosing the anonymity of the ocean to hide behavior towards animals for which they would be jailed if done on land. Shame on Greenlaw and all her crew. This book was filled with an unmistakable, greed-driven hatred of the ocean and all its creatures."
4,An account of a challenging endeavor,"Quite a story for anyone interested in the sea and adventure. Written in a Captain's Log point of view, it puts you right near the activity. The Mug Up chapters were thoughtfully placed. Rarely has there been a book this easy to lose oneself in."
4,HUNGRY OCEAN SATISFIES APPETITE !!!!,"After I read Junger's book, ""The Perfect Storm"", I thought I had hit the jackpot. I am an Ocean Fishing fanatic. Loved Jungers work and then saw that Greenlaw had her own tale to tell as well.This book fills in the details(WAY DETAILED) that Junger left out. Great rituals, humorous anecdotes and great character descriptions make this book a ""must read"" if you liked ""Perfect Storm"". It reads like a Captain's Log, rather than a real ""Page turner"".Loved it.Tim Heyer"
4,Ocean Politics,"Author Linda Greenlaw captures the highs and lows of commercial fishing in the North Atlantic. Her prose is simplistic, but to the point. We are constantly reminded of the sea and how it adjudicates over fisherman, ships, and the lives of anyone who dares to venture out into it. The author is an amazing woman who chased her dreams and found a home at sea. The book does go into a lot of detail of day-to-day existence aboard a swordboat, but if you find that boring, you are missing the point entirely. Riding on the ""wave"" of publicity surrounding The Perfect Storm, the author tells it like it is. If you are remotely interested in factual sea-faring stories, this is the book for you. A fascinating read and another chapter in man/woman's fascination with the sea and it's inspiring, but sometimes deadly politics."
2,A poorly written book full of jargon.,"I enjoyed the Perfect Storm and that is why I read this book. It was a great disappointment. It is full of fishing and technical terms and descriptions without a singe diagram to explain what is being described. I also did not like the exploitive nature of the entire book. I have fished all over the U.S. and outside of the U.S. and I have come to release all of the fish I catch with few exceptions. I know comercial fisherman must keep what they catch, but I hope someone is monitoring the swordfish fisheries. I would not recommend this book."
3,am i sea sick or was that sordfish bad?,"Greenlaw's Hungry Ocean rode the wave of the Perfect Storm's immense popularity to best seller lists, but left me hungry for more. No, not a longer book or a sequel, but vision that revealed more about this presumably interesting figure. Greenlaw's account of her experiences as a swordifish captain is filled with potential. I rooted for her- she was afterall a woman winning a man's game.But ultimately I felt cheated by this tome. I wanted Greenlaw to reveal more. How did she become the top swordfish captain? I sensed she was at once ruthless, incredibly intelligent, and extraordinarily hardworking, but I felt as I filled in the blanks from the too often cursory information provided by the author. Her minimalist style opens the door to the world of deep sea fishing, but I found the water murky."
1,don't waste your time & money,"Author wasted too many pages on unnecessary info where he could have had more pics, and include some basic drawings with dims included, and the pics included were dark and lacked detail. The author mentions his designs in great length about muzzle brakes on 22's and 50 cal and describes them, well thats great but if you go thru that trouble to talk about them why not include some pics or drawings of your work. I'm sure the author makes some great stuff and good quality at that, but when you write a book so you can teach others give more detail then just words. The suppressor part was all text with a few flashy pics of them finished and installed, no drawings with specs."
1,"Also-Problems for small dogs, especially","I am thinking of adopting ASPCA rescued small dogs. After looking at books re dogs, many are unable to eat: garlic, onion, chocolate, avocado... (See for example the ""Everything Chihuahua Book""-available as well on Amazon) Also, most dogs are not supposed to have diets high in fat or salt. According to one author, dogs can even have seizures from too much of some of these ingredients-even salt. By the way, I also know birds are allergic to some of these ingredients-as well. Apparently, smaller animals are effected the most immediately and seriously by these foods. Unfortunately, the first recipe for dogs (in the intro provided for free on Amazon) uses garlic and 1/3 cup oil. I guess I will have to improvise myself: as I have found not one brand of dog food that would be safe per the rules listed above. (If I adopt.)"
5,Gotta love books!,"I love this book too! Four months before the commercial dog food scare last year, I had begun to make my two boys' food at home. I read the ingredients in a popular bag of dry and canned dog food and was disgusted with all of the chemical/additives that they contained. I went online to find safe recipes for homemade dog food, making sure that my dogs received the correct portions and nutrients. I decided I needed some cook books for my boys, so I bought two from Amazon. This one has vegetarian style and meat filled recipes. It also has recipes for treats and special meals. 90% of the recipes are grocery items that you already have at home, ""real food"" as the title suggests. One of the best parts in the book are the nuggets of helpful hints about care, dangerous foods, and nutritional info etc. found scattered throughout. My boys can't wait for me to try these new recipes on them."
1,Un-realistic,"I got this book based on the reviews. I also got it to help supplement transitioning my dogs to a natural, raw food diet. This book is unrealistic for the typical dog owner and is supported by commercial dogfood makers. The author encourages using the receipes in the book AND kibbled dogfood. Also, there is miss information regarding serving raw food and bones. The author suggests rawhides, as oppose to raw bones. Rawhides are a leading choking cause for dogs. Not to mention, some are not made in the US and contain unhealthy meat products. If you serve bad meat to you dog, of course they will get sick. Dogs do not have the same digestive system as humans and we should not impose the same principals. Kibble does not help maintain good oral hygine, as is suggested in this book.This book does provide receipes, but please do not use it as a resource for providing a balanced diet for your dog."
5,"MORE cheese, please!","When all the news started about the dog food problem, I was so glad I'd purchased Arden Moore's book. My ""fur children"" LOVE the 'Say Cheese, Please"" treats from REAL FOOD FOR DOGS. I've tried other recipes from this book and they've all been given the 'Paws of Approval.'"
2,probably not vet-approved,"Ok, a few of these recipes are good and very healthy for dogs.But others contain ingredients that will certainly make your dogs sick. Another reviewer already pointed out that some recipes contain rice. While rice isn't something dogs would eat in the wild, most commercial dog foods contain rice and it's not harmful.However, dogs are lactose-intolerant once they are adults, so any recipe calling for cheese is a no-no.Also, some recipes call for onions or garlic. Alliums are poisonous to dogs. Do not put onions or garlic or anything that is related to onions or garlic into a dog's bowl. The effect might not be immediate, but alliums will damage their red blood cells and make your pets anemic."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This book is terrible. They bend so far over backwards not to insult men that they insult women. It tells you basically, yes he is a jerk but YOU must bend over backwards to accomodate his jerkiness. It adds to the current family court system that says that you can do whatever you want and the person pooped on must be the one to give in to the selfish one, the one who is morally wrong. That is right. We live in the west. Morals are relative.Don't buy this book unless you want more frustration."
1,Not worth opening the cover,"Not much information to find in this book, though it can be entertaining if you are bitter and need to find something to read while you are in the same situation. Don't look for answers from this self helper, there are none. Spend your money on ice cream instead. You'll be happy you did."
2,This book is incomplete in it computer jargon.,Many times I have read other updated computer books and have not found them listed in this glossary. I am an intermediate computer user that reads other computer architect books. If the word is listed it will often give a very good explaination. I have many times learned things from this book that the authors from other computer books didn't make clear.
2,Had to return it..,After finding out that this camera was cheap and flimsy and had no audio when recording a video. This camera is only good for outdoors and mid range distances... And mabie taking pictures.. of items for ebay but not up close.I can't find any more use of this camera.
3,"Good, but expecting much more","I really enjoy reading Coffe Will Make You Back, and I couldn't wait to read the sequel. I was hoping Steve would have made up her about what she wanted. Stevie was stronger in the first book and in this book I found to be to much of a follower or pushover. I enjoy April Sinclair's writing style, and I like the way the book flowed, but I was just expected so much more at the end."
1,Golf in the Kingdom,"If you like far fetched stories about leprechauns, this is the book for you. I found it tedious and lecturing."
1,I rarely return a book for a refund...,"but this one just had to go. While this book offers tips on neither golf nor life it IS rife with stereotyping and lacking in continuity. The point of the book will elude you - guaranteed. The 'spiritual' ending makes you wonder why he didn't ask a real writer to suggest a suitable conclusion (and while he was in the area, a little editing was in order as well - this offering is in need of more than a little revision). At any rate, I read these reviews before I bought the book and failed to heed the sensible warnings posted herein. Do yourself a big favor, check this one out of the library BEFORE you buy. What a total waste of good paper."
2,An acidhead's philosophizing of golf,"This was Out There. I'm not sure if it is for burnout golfers or just burnouts. I don't think I would classify this as a sports book, more like bad philosophy. I couldn't even believe in the main character, Shivas, I was too aware of his being a mouthpiece for Murphy's attempts to revolutionize one's conceptualization of golf...or life...or something like that...I still don't know. What the heck was his point??"
3,Plastic type,I haven't had a chance to use it but I am slightly disappointed that the type of plastic is different than what is pictured.I was sent a polycarbonate version but was expecting a high/low density polyethylene.
2,Didn't help with heel slippage.,"I bought these for a pair of shoes that kept sliding off my heels when I walked in them. Shoe still slips off, even with 2 pairs of them inserted. Definitely not worth the money."
3,Nice item but pretty basic,This portable Cd/cassette player is nice but pretty basic. Not a lot of technical features. The keys all feel a little on the cheap plastic side. The size is nice and small so it is very portable and doesn't take up much room wherever you put it. Overall a nice basic product as long as you aren't wanting a lot of features.
1,Che mai vegg'io?,"I'd like to nominate this as the worst modern ERNANI. Besides the rudimentary conducting (the muffled orchestra sounds as if covered by a blanket), the four principals - wooden actors whose names I don't even care to remember - are wobbly and seem to gasp for breath while phrasing their lines (extremely painful to hear). Though Dynamic is known for its note-complete sets, in the light of such a poor performance, the excision of second verses is more than welcome (there's also a short cut in the finale). The performance does improve a little in Act 4 (too late). Dynamic's release of this production on DVD one year after the CD version has added insult to injury. A full-price cipher (the star above is Verdi's)."
5,Sad,"I hope some publisher will do the world a favor and keep this book in print. It's a classic that belongs on the shelf right next to D'Arcy Thompson's ""On Growth and Form."" This might seem strange for me to say, but if I were to design an educational curriculum for people learning my profession (oncology), this book would be mandatory. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in morphogenesis. If anyone knows where I can buy 10 or 20 unused copies, I'd appreciate hearing from you (wmshea@earthlink.net)."
5,Stupendous,This is the fastest paced Dick I have read. Some people may think the ending is 'trick' but I found it absoloutley delightful. A masterpiece of 'human' sci-fi.
5,Perfect Math Desk Reference Book,"I am studying to pass a teacher certification test for High School Math. Barron's Mathematics 129 page book is the perfect desk reference. It is a mini-encyclopedia of remarkable scope. Descriptions are short, informative, and interesting. Brief examples, diagrams and simple English explanations are precise and clear. Hundreds of fast math facts through pre-calculus. Don't throw out your math books that go into more depth but for quick lookups this book can't be beat."
3,Java Software Solutions,"This book could have shown the examples, especially the complicated ones, a lot more in depth. The basic information of the book is good, but it is very dry. The chapter on recursion is not very helpful at all. The author could also make better examples for exception handling."
1,Dvorak Saint-Saens Concertos,"Dvorak/Saint-Saens: Cello Concertos - Mstislav Rostropovich, Carlo Maria Giulini, London Philharmonic OrchestraI have not received this product yet. Please advise when I will get it.Thank you,Sarah E. Stanton"
2,Rather poor,"OK, in my opinion this album is basically a flop. Very little stands out. Much of it just flows along with nothing terribly interesting. Lyrically it leaves a lot to be desired. U.R.S. at least had some real good songs on it. About half the album was really good. And S.F.I.J was absolutely her best album. I'm beginning to think it was her peak back in 1998. It's stupid for me to think I can restrate what's been said in 80-some reviews before me, so I'm keeping this brief. Many of the reviews below give it 5 stars. I don't know why. I think this album is very poor, and was a waste of my money. I expected much more from an artist whose proven she has a lot to offer. In my opinion, just pretend this album was never released, and listen to her past two studio albums. But then, that's just my opinion....."
4,(((this so- called c . h . a . o. s .))),"This betters ""Under Rug Swept"" and has more radio friendly quality to it, I randomly bought this thinking what the hell but this is not ""JLP"" but this just may be one of her best albums since ""JLP"" I Really love The Opening Track ""Eight Easy Steps"" and then it goes on to ""Out is through"" and nearly track after track is listenable, ""This Grudge"" for me is the highlight of the album itself its a wonderful track and 2 songs after ""grudge"" ,"" Everything"" kicks in, another great song. This album deserves a #1 spot more than ""Under Rug Swept"" which was just average, instead this album can be reffered to as a Top 5 AlbumKey TraX:Eight Easy StepsOut Is ThroughExcusesKnees Of My BeesThis GrudgeSpinelessEverythingI Reccomend ""S-CC"" at about 89% or 92% very good album"
4,True to Form,"""Jagged Little Pill"" was the best -- but why? Because we were starving for something different and along came Alanis with an edgy, rocky, verbally honest set and a unique new voice. Picture what it would be like if there were no ""Jagged Little Pill"" and suddenly you hear ""So Called Chaos."" Although not as edgy as JLP, it certainly is a return of sorts to a similar style tempered with the distinction of her other work. It is immediately likeable. I put it second to JLP. If this had been the first thing she ever did, it would probably be a smash. But what are we looking for, Alanis music or something different? If you want something different, go somewhere else. If you want Alanis music, you will not be dissappointed with this one. Those who naysay this album and give it poor ratings were probably looking for something else. Those of us who like Alanis because we like Alanis will not be dissappointed. Enjoy."
4,So Called Chaos,"Come on everybody -- give Alanis some credit for growing spiritually and artistically! I thank her for continuing to reach out and sweep us along on her journey. And Amazon, I would like to disagree with your editorial review -- the track ""Doth I Protest Too Much"" is not about a woman with Zen-like serenity. On the contrary! Revisit the lyrics! It's about a woman in agony as she PRETENDS to project calm detachment. (See the source of the title: ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks"" from Shakespeare's Hamlet.) At least Alanis is trying, and that's progress. Her honesty and flare continue to be a breath of fresh air ... you won't be disappointed in this album if you believe life is a journey of never-ending lessons to be learned. Thank U !!!"
2,...,"Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk. This album is one of those three."
3,dot dot dot,"This CD is alright...Alanis has obviously taken to the trend of glossy, polished studio recordings, with the likes of Avril Lavigne. But at least Alanis writes her own songs ( without the aid of famous songwriters ) and can carry a melody without having other vocals tracked over her ( once again, see Lavigne's first album's notes ).Erm...and Melmoth, I hope you were joking, but the lost continent you were thinking of was ""Atlantis."" Maybe watch the Disney movie? It's about as mediocre as ""So Called Chaos."" The raw Alanis we once knew is forever lost."
2,Dissappointment,"I just don't like it, it doesn't appeal to me. I am normally blown away by her work but this new album couldn't be any more grey and boring. Her voice appears more whiney than usual, and is not complimented by the backing tracks, she sounds too harsh! Not a pleasurable album ""who is whining now?"" you are alanis."
5,Beautiful,So-Called Chaos is worth buying just to hear Alanis' beautiful voice. It sounds incredible on this album. Alongside her gorgeous singing you get incredible melodies. These songs are catchy and thought provoking. Don't miss out!
2,Very disappointing,"Lets get this straight at the outset - I LOVE Alanis.Her first album was without a doubt one of the most powerful female debuts ever. Her follow up album (Supposed former blah blah), was to be quite honest - dirge. About 18 tracks, 5 of which had any tune worth humming (ironic really, considering it spawned the stunning Thank You).Then came Under Rug Swept. A happier, more commercial and brilliant cd. Nt as angst rideen as Jagged little Pill and not as innovative, but a great album non-the-less.Which brings me onto this, her 4th album (excl. the Canadian releases).This is NOT a good album. It lies somewhere between the 2nd album (remember- the dirge) and the 3rd. Half of it is virtually tuneless, the other half is 'nice'.She always has so much to say for herself - sometimes Alanis, LESS IS MORE!!!!A big disappointment. :("
1,TOTALLY UNORIGINAL,"Alanis' video for ""Everything"" is a COMPLETE rip-off of latin singer Jarabe de Palo's video for ""Bonito"". I could not believe my eyes when i saw it. This totally lowers my expectations for her album and for her."
2,For kids only,"I remember getting this and being quite disappointed. The figure sculpt isn't nearly as good as the original Darth Maul figure. The ""fighting"" action when you press the buttons is pretty unrealistic. Also, because the arms are so loose to allow that ""action,"" you can't pose the figure without the lightsaber hilt. Overall, I'd only recommend this to young kids."
4,Viva Allegra,"I first saw Allegra Kent perform with the New York City Ballet when I was five years old, and it was in large part her performance that turned me into an instant ballet fan. The beautiful Ms. Kent--whose autobiography is an entertaining and sometimes poignant account of life in the competitive, back breaking world of professional dance--was one of George Balanchine's celebrated muses, and one of the most brilliant ballerinas of the 1950s and '60s. She could be alternately lyrical and funny, frightening and sensuous, ethereal and earthy; her pliant, stretchy body and dramatic flair made her a fascinating purveyor of the Balanchine style. Her life story, complete with the ups and downs of family life, motherhood, a rocky marriage, and the intense pressure of working with some of the groundbreaking dancers of mid-20th-century America, is presented in unsparing detail...making it an engrossing read for all balletophiles."
3,"Great for Mom, but kids got lost","I think it's a good review for parents, however, my 3.5 and 5.5 year old were quite lost with so many human characters and numerous ""creature"" characters that it made the story rather confusing and hard to follow. Also, the topics of romance, marriage, engagement, etc are still beyond them at this point. We have 4 other Jim Weiss Cds and we are throughly in love with them and play them often. This one might be better for them in a few years."
5,Great product for the price - I take it everywhere,"I have had this player for about 10 months now and I love it. I use it daily in my car and take it with me on business trips. Battery life is OK with regular CDs and excellent with MP3 CDs. One of the reasons I originally bought this instead of the Slim-X is because I can use AA sized NiMh rechargable batteries. I bring along my recharger and AA batteries for this and my digital camera. You can find a charger and batteries on sale for about $15 - $20 and up depending on the charging time. Although the lid may seem ""flimsy"", the player has held up well despite many plane and car trips. I take it everywhere.The sound quality is great, I have yet to find a disc that it won't play and the remote works fine. I love the remote volume control and I use the remote fast forward and reverse for language tapes in the car. I bought my wife the IMP-350 and we both love that as well. It's really a question of how much money you want to spend versus the features."
3,Not very good art,"Deibler covers the basics well, but his pictures clearly demonstrate that a lot more is needed than the basics. I suppose this is a matter of personal taste, but to me his pictures are cliched and obvious, his handling of color sometimes harsh and unmodulated. Anything more complex than secondary colors seems beyond him. His pictures resemble ""art"", but I don't think they quite rise to that level. I guess the success of Impressionism is still reverberating in the minds of some; Deibler is a third rate Impressionist."
3,Not a good book for beginners,I can't really recommend this book unless you have a good grasp of the subject already. If just starting out and want to learn about navigating with a compass and map I suggest Wilderness Navigator. I couldn't really get out of the beginning of this book with a good comprehension of the subject.
2,Not impressed. Disappointed. you get the picture.,I am a Pussycat dolls fan but this song is not one of their best. Their song is all over the radio and #1 on VH1's top 40 songs of 2006. but i don't get it. this song sounds just like all the others.
4,Arkady Renko finds the rhythm of post-Russian Cuba.,"M.C. Smith is gifted writer who, through the eyes of Arkady Renko, an ill-fated Russian investigator, has shown us sable smuggling in the old Soviet Union (Gorky Park) and the floating Gulag aboard a Russian trawler (Polar Star). Renko introduced us to the Russian Mafia that filled the vacuum left by Soviet collapse (Red Square). Now Renko's back, revealing the dark rhythms of Cuban drums and the fetid aroma of socialist decay, Caribbean-style. In Havana Bay, Smith's careful crafting of the prose and his sharp insight into the Soviet world are several cuts above the magnetism of the plot, but you'll love the way he tells it."
4,Another wonderful Renko novel,"Taking Renko to Cuba for an entire novel seemed a bit of a risk, but it worked out beautifully since so much of his cynicism about the Soviet system translated to the situation he found in Cuba. Smith's manner of offering settings and dialogue also continued to provide great fun. Some have complained about not fully understanding the plot until near the end, but that was one of the things I loved. My only complaint was how quickly and conveniently some characters got dispatched at the end. Still, I certainly had a good time with this, and can strongly recommend it."
4,Luminous setting - murky plot,"Havana Bay, like many of Martin Cruz Smith's books, works becasue he recreates the milieu of his story so well - and because it is so interesting a setting. The plot itself is so dense that it recedes behind the scenery. Arkady Renko, Russian and self-conscious to the core, stands out like a sore thumb in Havana. His clothes, his attitude, his singular search for the truth about what happened to his late 'friend', all set him apart from those around him and propel him to the less than exciting conclusion that Cruz serves up for the reader. Far from the best of the Renko series, Havana Bay is still an interesting story and deserves to be read. Cruz can conjure up locale and scene better than any writter I know. If for no other reason than a vicarious trip to contemporary Havana, I would recommend this book."
5,Claridge's and caviar ...,"In London, Claridge's and caviar is at the opposite end of the spectrum to fish 'n' chips (or a burger from a drive thru in the States). ""Havana Bay"" is by far the best thriller I have read of Smith's for many a year. The decaying waterfront scenes of old Havana redolent of Steinbeck in his heyday. If you haven't yet come across MCS's character/investigator Arkady Renko, I urge you to do so. If you like quality, you'll love this work. As his British namesake John Templeton Smith (his 'White Lie' is every bit as brilliant as 'Havana Bay') MCS is for my money the best of the American novelists and destined for the classic shelf."
3,Who wrote this book?,"As with each of the other Renko novels, the author displays an amazing knowledge of Russian/emigre customs, habits and Weltanschauung. Too bad he doesn't have the same skills with the non-Russian aspects, with which he should be much more familiar.Judging by the typos, awkward idioms and plain misuse of English, I wonder, who actually wrote these books? Is the author really an American with the background he claims to have? Is he two people? Or somebody else?"
2,Stuck in a Rut,"Mr. Smith has a beautiful gift with the use of descriptions to paint mavelous pictures. His plot,at least in this book, takes a loooong time to take off and by that time I really didn't give a hoot about Havana or the Bay."
2,"Rich on atmosphere, but the plot is a mess","I liked the descriptions of Cuba -- evocative and interesting. It was a good idea to put Arkady in Cuba, a country that is connected to Russia in its shared history, but is its polar opposite in culture and climate. I was frustrated with the story because it meandered, confused and, after plodding through it, the ending was disappointing."
3,Naboo Royal Security Guard,I hear there were two version of Naboo guards available on the market but I have only seen one. This guard is well equipped but there are other guards in the movie that should have been developed as well as Naboo pilots.
1,Not great....too many flaws to mention,"Poor production values, a lame script and some heartfelt but otherwise lacklustre performances all contribute to drag down what could have been a good story. If the characters were any more one dimensional they'd be cardboard. The whole thing is so over simplified in the set-ups and then the acting doesn't help the story's credibility at all. Truly a shame.With a different cast and a better screenwriter this story may have had a chance. It wants to be The Sum Of Us, and it ends up not adding up to enough to hold a movie together."
1,bad acting,The actors and the dialogue in this movie are very very bad. I cant believe anyone can take this seriously...
1,A disappointing waste of time and money,"Too bad . . . this movie has narrow market appeal and I like to support such efforts, but I am ashamed to own such a feature as this. Low-budget isn't an excuse. It took four minutes for me to realize that the acting by the small cast, not to mention the silly screenplay, were abysmal. An utter disappointment. Wish I had read the online reviews before I pressed ""Order."" My copy is in the garbage. I wouldn't share this with anyone."
3,Historical inaccuracies mar an otherwise great read,"This is a refreshing change of pace both as to the historical setting and the main characters. I have to agree with a prior review that some parts do stretch credulity but that is the nature of fiction. However, historical innacuracies can be jarring: they alert the reader to read more carefully and thus detract from the fun of reading the story itself. One would not expect to see rumrunners off New York in July, 1935, nearly two years after repeal. And if George VI ascended the throne of Britain in late March, 1937, who filled in from December, 1936 when Edward VIII abdicated? Neither of these examples is essential to the story, but littering the story with this sort of thing does detract from it. Still, a good read."
5,Peegy Sue,Whoah....a better Sweet Valley High. This book was very entertaining and one of those books to be read in an hour. I cant wait for the mystery to be solved! Spike is a very cool character and the dweed rocks. It has a very realistic setting unlike Sweet Valley. Lacey is a very complex character and Raven gives it a bit of a realistic touch.
4,"very good, a bit longer time than the old mercury ones","I have no trouble shaking this thing down unlike the old mercury ones that seemed to take much longer. However, it does seem to take longer to get the accurate reading. We tested a few times when we first got it, and the longer we waited (3-4 minutes) the better it got. I would not recommend any shorter than 3 minutes..."
2,One of the best movies of recent years,The NTSC region 1 blu-ray looks terrible. too much noise reduction smeared it's colors and contrast completely and created ugly artifacts...Get the pal region 2 version. it's way better than this crap.5 stars for the movie.
1,Spanish with English subtitles,"I bought it, found out that it is only in Spanish with English Subtitles, and promptly returned it.I have bought DVD movies that have English, Spanish, French and German. But, all of them had English as an option. This DVD does not give you that option. Too bad since I WAS interest in the movie, but I will never watch it until it is offered in ENGLISH."
1,Return to sender,"There needs to be a warning, ""This movie has no English audio track!"" When I ordered it, under Product Description it said Language: English and because of that wrong information (that has now been fixed), I am allowed and will return it for a refund. If others are unsatisfied, I would advise them to do the same.If an actual English version is ever released, I will give it a shot, but I just can't enjoy a movie with subtitles."
1,A Horrible Piece of Crap,"When I came to this site to review, I was NOT SURPRISED to see 54 one star reviews already. I stopped the movie at the first brutally violent (and totally unnecessary ) scene, with the intuitive knowledge that there would be repetitions of this kind of sickness. I see from the other reviews I was correct. I wasted my time and money, and got my expectations up that this would be along the lines of a well made fantasy... it had all potential to be... i for one would like ratings for violence and cruelty in movies from now on! I had to smudge my room and light white candles after this! And go out for a long run. I felt insulted and violated."
5,Great! Wonderful! Wow!,"This is a beautifully made movie with such twists and turns that you find yourself on the edge of your chair throughout most of the movie. It is not for young children and is appropriate for older teens and up. It is well made, with phenomenal acting and draws you in to the story in such a way that it stays with you. This movie is one of the truly greats and I cannot say enough wonderful things about it. Everyone I know who has seen this movie says the same thing, ""Great!"" You have to see it to believe it."
5,Dawn2Dusk2,"I LOVE IT!!!! It was bittersweet but awsome just the same. I plan to buy it later. I am also considering buying the soundtrack one of the songs was very soothing!! The sub-tites made it even more intersing!!! Again the movie was awsome!!!Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!: The Brother Grimm, Jorge Luis Borges and Guillermo De Toro's all of you were awsome in working on the movie!!!AWSOME!!! AWSOME!!!!"
4,Pans Labryinth,"creative, imaginative, and graphics beautifully done. Director and editor did a fantastic job. The ability to capture such a compelling villian in the movie was truly amazing."
2,This is not a very good movie to me,This movie was billed as a fantasy movie and as it turns out is about 10% fantasy and 90% war. Truly this was unnecessarily violent and brutal at times. I don't think any of the characters were that interesting either.
2,Why was this movie so well received?,"This struck me as a fairy tale version of Anne Frank goes to Narnia, where lack of common sense, bad dialog, predictability, and graphically brutal violence carry the movie. At many times I felt there was no real logical flow between what a character did, their motives, or what they'd tolerate as an acceptable situation."
2,Beautiful depressing movie,"I like the fact that they have made a fairy tale with a darker plot. I'm tired of these popcorn Disney fairy tales as much as the next guy. The movie itself was beautifully done, and was a visual feast. The acting was amazing. But I watch a movie to be entertained and all this one did was depress. From beginning to the very end i kept hoping the movie would have maybe a couple of cheerful moments or that maybe something good would happen for the main character and no such relief was ever at hand. I'm sorry but if i want to see someone tormented for two hours, I'd at least like something good to come of it by the end of the movie. For those of you who feel that it deserves five stars I really got to ask, are you tormented yourself, or just really into pain?"
5,A magical fantasy for grown ups.,"This is a masterpiece of modern cinema. Created by master filmmakers Guillermo Del Toro, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is magical, fantastical, and frightening. Its melding of a fantasy world with the very real atrocities of war is mystifying and terrifying. One of the most visually stirking and inventive films I've ever seen."
5,Excellent product,"Product was cheap in price but not in quality. Arriving still encased in the original cellophane, the movie was in peak condition. The description was reliable and honest; I would recommend others to buy from this site."
4,"Excellent ""Fairy Tale"" just not for kids","I saw this movie in the theatre last year and it was an excellent film. Visuals were great, the story was well crafted. It was much more brutal than I expected (those of you who saw it know what I mean). It is certainly not for children. While stories with similar events might have been told to children in years gone by, children didn't ""see"" it. I don't think the violence is gratuitous.I would recommend the movie for adults who like dark fairy tales. While there I s a lot of ""war movie"" in it, all the pieces do fit together well."
5,definitely get it on Blu Ray!,"oh...when this film was released on dvd i was so disappointed with the transfer, quality didn't look too good. but boy..the blu ray version is so awesome that you really want to watch it again at that moment, in the comfort of your own home. It's a great movie by the way!"
1,Fantastic film! LOUSY DVD PRESENTATION!!,"You'd think a big money making hog like New Line could get their **** together and release such a visually magnificent piece of cinematic art with AT LEAST a watchable dvd presentation. Ppffff! Oversaturated colour, serious artefacing, no shadow detail, flat picture, blacks turn to red. It didn't look like this in the cinema! Way to go big soulless corporation! You've taken our money and turned a piece of heart felt art into another McProduct..."
3,"Refreshing, Imaginative, Different","If you seek refreshment and innovative storytelling this is it.A Spanish language film, Labyrinth is the darker more sinister sister of The Chronicles of Narnia. It is a haunting allegory set in an unlikely place - if you pay attention you can see the Biblical references and follow the line all the way to the end, where it becomes less subtle.If you're not into that 'stuff', it's okay - it's still a magical ride that is also a bit of a mystery. The visual effects are understated and lack the 'look at me' Hollywood glamour, makes them all the more attractive.The backdrop of the story adds historical realism and another layer to follow but complements the underlying meaning of this paradoxical tale of light and darkness.If you don't mind watching and reading you'll like this little bit of escape."
4,Pan's Labyrinth,Definite addition to my collection of Dark and Dreamy Fantasy Collection. Right next to Mirror Mask
4,on of the best grown-up fanatsy films,"excellent picture quality but no english language. if you like this film you must watch also ""mirror mask""."
5,Excellent Movie,"This is a dark and beautiful work of fantasy, and I would recommend it to anyone who liked Lord of the Rings or similar. It has an incredible cast, but is not for the faint-hearted. There is some really graphic violence in the movie."
4,Haunting!!,"I saw this film at the cinema and came out shell shocked. What an amazing film!! I just had to get this on DVD because I was constantly haunted by the storyline. I have since ordered and watched the film again and loved the film even more. Many of the scenes are quite brutal and I found some hard to watch, some are heart renching and had me in tears, whist others had me on the edge of my seat. One of my favourites!!"
1,Disturbing,"This is a film that appaled me the first time I saw it, and just thinking about it brings back unpleasant memories. I feel it's because of the attempt to mix childhood fantasy with adult violence (sorry, the two don't mix). The brutality is unbelievably gross, and the entire film needs to be reclassified as being in the ""horror"" genre. I'm sorry I saw this, and am trying to forget it."
2,PAN'S LABRYNITH,"This had to be one of the WORST movies I have ever purchased. It is in Spanish & has English subtitles. The story is dark & violent. The father is nothing but a murderer. There is nothing remotely good, or kind about this story. Don't buy it if you have children. Very graphic. A horrible, horrible movie!!"
2,I must be missing something?,The blurb on the cover of the DVD I have indicates that this film is in the tradition of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. What an insult to the great master. I found the mythical characters so poorly depicted as to be ludicrous. The guy with the eyes in his hands is so ridiculous as to be truly laughable. The story is fine and the acting of the 'humans' fine also. Overall I see nothing to rate this picture four stars.
5,Fan's review,"During the years of Fascist oppression in Spain, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) moves to a creepy mill in the countryside with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) and violent stepfather (Sergi Lopez), who is a military officer hunting rebels in the surrounding mountains. Ofelia discovers that she has a powerful connection to a grotesque, wonder-filled world of magic and fantasy and undergoes great drama as events come to a head in both the realms of magic and reality.Director / writer Guillermo del Toro has established himself as one of the premier fantasists of cinema. His distinctive visual sense is used to great advantage here. This fairy tale is not so much for children as for adults who may have forgotten the horror at the root of all fairy tales in this Disneyfied era, as well as their mythic connections to real world events. Del Toro remembers and incorporates this understanding in his powerful film."
1,Lasted a week,"These boots arrived very quickly, well-packaged, and they were really cute. The size chart is exactly right-on; they did fit, but they twisted around on my dog's feet with every step she took. Unfortunately, however, the boots literally fell apart within a week. My dog did NOT chew on them, as she is not a ""chewer,"" although she does tend to lick her feet sometimes, which is why I had the boots on her. We never even went for a walk in them; she only wore them in the house, and only while I was there. I'm thinking that if dog saliva ruined these so quickly, then they probably aren't going to last in ""extreme"" weather conditions as is implied in the name of the product. I'm glad I didn't take her out in the cold and snow with these on as I'd originally planned."
3,more for a medium dog,"These boots are made for a medium size dog. My dog is about 121bs, but he is very hyper also. I put these boots on him and they would soon be off his feet as he runs in the snow outside. The black strap that holds the boots together doesnt strap all the way around. I had to use another tie to wrap around his feet so they can stay on when we went outside."
2,A well told tale about predictable characters,"The strongest part about this smoothly written tale is its description of Manhattan as the seasons reveal their distinct personalities. Unfortunately, the people who populate this group border on stereotypes( the ice queen, the shy accountant ready to blossom, the forceful therapist with a deep secret)whose imminent struggles are predictable and anti-climatic."
5,Miss Nelson has a Field Day,"Great book. Grandchildren loved it. They are ages 3 5 & 7...they have enjoyed the entire "" Miss Nelson"" series."
5,Excelent Bible!,"This is an excelent Bible!Handsome red leather, small size, full of devotional material for firefighters and first responders!I want to buy more and give them as gifts to every firefighter and first responder I know, it is that good!"
5,Definitely worth buying.,"Cathy Mann is an excellent up-and-coming author that takes love, despair, friendship, and bareknuckle brawling and makes a captivating tale called Code of Honor that draws readers in. As in most of her books, there's serious treatment of sometimes shocking and serious issues, but everything fits the story, and her characters still know how to have fun. The descriptions are vivid enough that I've still got a mental image of a street cafe lingering weeks after reading about it."
5,Amazing weird experimental smart music.,"So here is the thing, this album its great, but only for those who truly understand and appreciate music, so I guess its not for everyone, which is why I understand the mixed reviews, you almost have to be very hypersensitive to music otherwise you won't get it. Most of the songs are very mellow and deep, reminds me of a hybrid between Sigur Ros and The Smiths, his voice its very unique and he utilizes it very well, altough the big shocking its the music, it almost sounds like it comes from another planet and I love that."
1,i gave it one because u cant go any lower,"described in mexico as one of the young promises of the alt/indie scene, well theres nothing of that nature, im sorry, i find this band and album horrible, they r totally overrated, from the image of the disc to their songs there is a lack of creativity., they look like clowns and act like them, they sing in spanish and english, they seem to do ok with spanish, but english songs seem so fake and quite forced. dont buy this record!!!"
2,Did Not Fit True to Size,Length of leg was shorter than displayed in the photo that accompanied the item; not a very good fit -- returned.
3,Not as good as Icefire,"I read Icefire and thought it was a great book filled, with action and likeable characters. I looked forward to Quicksilver and if I hadn't of read Icefire I would have given up on it. The first 200 pages could have easily been shortened to 50 or so. I also didn't like the wimpy peace-loving male character. Don't get me wrong, I didn't mind, at first in this novel, the strong female characters, but it got a little much how they both thought of him (Tom Chase) as ""thick"" and a ""nuisance"". It almost sounded like the husband and wife writing team were communicating their frustrations about the other through the novel.The story, after the first 200 pages is however filled with action and will keep you reading.I will wait for reviews before reading another of Reeves-Stevens novels."
3,"Not as advertised, but works ok.","These batteries were 900mAh, not the 1100 advertised.I picked them up in 2008 and they worked ok in my cannon rebel.They don't hold a charge for long, but I just charge all my batteries before a trip if I want to use my camera a lot and when one dies I have more handy. These were pretty cheap, but I got another one for a little cheaper that works much better. I recommend a different battery."
3,Misleading,"The discription says ""by Canon"" but it is untrue. These are actually generic versions of the Canon batteries. If I had known I wouldn't have bought them. It's my mistake for not reading the reviews first, shame on me. As far as the quality of the batteries, I have not used them in my camera yet. I bought these for backups for the summer and am hoping for the best."
5,Great Deal on Batteries,"WOW, two batteries for less than the price of one name brand. Haven't used these a whole lot yet, but the intial use was great!"
2,Definitely Not 1000mAh,"When I recieved the package and pulled out the batteies there was a sticker on the boxes with large text that said 600mAh per batt which this does not meet or exceed canon's requirements since the canon batteries are over 700mAh per batt. But none the less, you get what you pay for, and for 8 Bucks you cant really be mad. Amazon should have the seller edit the description for this product since it is false advertising!"
3,Dragon Reels has jigs,"All in all a good recording and some interesting arrangements. Not technically bouzouki in the fore front like advertised, it's an English Cittern, but I enjoy that as well."
2,Rc Killer Whale toy boat,"I bought two of these boats. I didn't think the quality was very good. They were very light with thin plastic bodies. The instructions were difficult to read because the translation in to English was not good. My boys has a ball with them for about half an hour. Then one of the boats stopped working and even after recharging, we could not get it to work again. I probably would not buy one of these again."
1,Yuk! not the 80's synthesizer sound again...,"I hate to be cruel, but this CD is such a waste of resources. There is no traces of the quaint singer-songwriter of the 70's Andrew Gold (Thank You For Being A Friend) here. Instead, you hear the ""hip"" and plastic synthesizer sound/dance beats of the 80's repeated relentlessly in song after song."
4,Good book to understand 1 person's journey to wellness,"I think the book gave an interesting perspective of the affect that Schizophrenia can have on an individual. It's not everyone's story, just a unique individual's perspective. I could compare his story with the situation that is closer to me and actually feel good about the hope that is possible. It also reinforces the importance, to me, of how important it is for family to support those family members who suffer from this terrible disease. It was a bit repetitive after about 3 quarters of it, but reinforced his story of his many trips into mental institutions. It's wonderful that there are new medications that help to control so many of the negative aspects of the disease."
1,Horrid Title UnLike O'Reilly,"Terse explanations, poor diagrams, poor coding style, poor writing style, and poor information covered on each topic listed in table of contents with probably the exception being the Huffman algorithms for data compression. The book is out of standard with most of O'Reilly's rich text and exhaustive detail and real world working code blocks and monitor like diagrams, but this book is nothing but fill and a terrible disappointment. The book is listed at Amazon as having 400 pages, not true, do not believe it, the book actually has 600. I suggest for the critism that Sedgwick gets, his Algorithms in C++ Parts 1-4 is truly the most detailed book on algorithms and data structures there is and it is the best to be a guru software engineer in problem solving and algorithm and data structure mastery. The next book to read that may be better than Sedgewick's is Sartag Sahni's Algorithms, Data Structures, and Applications in C++ by MacGraw-Hill."
3,"good, concise algorithm book ruined by comment","compare to most algorithm/data structure books out there, this book is not as complete as those, but it's much easier to read, and diagrams in this book is well drawn and much eaiser to follow. Why would I only give it 3 stars? One thing really ruined this book - obviously the publisher/editor/author try to increase the total page number by putting ridiculously big comment block in sample code(single line comments takes about 5 lines, all surrounded by '*' and spaces) This made the sample code difficult to read, imagine a 5 line function has to be printed in 2 or 3 pages."
4,Pretty Thorough,"This book is pretty thorough, but provides the exact information you can find on the web. Check out at the library instead of purchasing if you must read it."
5,Another satisfied customer,"This is a beautiful ""coffee table"" book that transcends its status as the last word for Disneyland post card collectors. It is actually the best book on the history of Disneyland that I've ever seen (and I'm constantly looking :-). It is also fascinating just from a cultural history point of view--the complete oveure of all postcards from any landmark would be interesting to study changing styles and mores, and of course Disneyland is so rich and varied. Hats off to Mumford and Gordon."
3,Disappointing,"Normally, I love Pamela Dean's works - the literary allusions always keep me thinking. However, this book while it still had the same flavor as Tam-Lin (my favorite book of Dean's), didn't have the same emotional impact.Also, although I won't spoil it for anyone, the ending seemed unfair the the main character and comes out of nowhere. It isn't a book that I would recommend to everyone unreservedly"
1,I've read better...,I began reading this book thinking I was reading a true FANTASY. It was very tedious and hard to get into. I believe Dean went into too much detail on the subjects of Shakespeare and astronomy instead of writing an actual book that people could enjoy.
1,Lubricant sent from the Devil,"This stuff was made in Satan's lair. My bf put it on and when it got in me I swear I thought my nether-reigon was on fire. It was like having 100 fire ants in me--OMG! If your significant other pulls this out of the nightstand, run for your life!!!"
3,Weakest Live album,"Better off not getting this record if you're checking out Live for the first time, Buy the ""Awake:the best of live album which includes the best track off of this one... Or if you just want to pick one, Throwing Copper (1994), or Distance to Here (1999) is better with more good tracks beyond the singles and you can just let them play without hitting the track forward button. This album has too much slow stuff; and very vanilla until the last few tracks and I find myself track skipping a lot when I play it. Only a couple of stand out tracks which they smartly used as singles: Lakini's Juice and Freaks; and Turn my head, although sounding rehashed is pretty good. The rest of the record ho-hum.Personally I think even the V album from 2001 is better than this one."
4,Not Live's Best,"I am a huge Live fan and though I didn't enjoy Secret Samadhi as much as I enjoyed their other albums, I still liked it.It definetly has a different style than Live's other CDs. It's much heavier, and the lyrics are much more grim, and very disturbing compared to Live's other albums.Unfortunatly, it's just not as good. The songs aren't as wonderful as those of Throwing Copper, and the lyrics aren't as powerful as Mental Jewelry's.But the CD was still fun and good like the rest of Live's albums, the best song being ""Lakini's Juice"". Hell, I'll give it 4 stars just for being by Live."
1,Live Drops a Bomb,"I bought this CD with high expectations after Throwing Copper, and what a letdown it was. I have to wonder if Ed Kowalczyk was sniffing glue at this point in his life, because the lyrics are just that bad. To compound the matter, the music is actually good, but the CD is rendered unlistenable by the aforementioned Mr. Ed. Look them up on the internet, I'm not exaggerating. They include the most horrible rhymes, have little discernable content or value, and aim for knee-jerk enlightenment by invoking a few Indian words and Hindu Gods. You will not be enlightened by listening to this CD, however, you may have a few good laughs."
4,Only one page of female hands,I was disappointed to find 99% of the book is drawings of male handsand felt misled. Good drawings though...
4,""" In No Shadows At All ""","""Shadowlines"" Is a great example of Jazz/Fusion. I must thank Amazon.Com for providing such an incredible amount of music like this to the public. I recomend this recording to anyone who makes their own choices as to what music they listen to and purchase. A real class act!"
5,Traci Lords: The Newest Diva of Dance!,"FANASTIC! Unlike most techno albums, Lords debut goes beyond simple rave standards and packs an album full of meaningful energy and alot of feeling. It starts off with the hit single 'Control' (from the film ""Mortal Kombat"") and takes you into a virtual dance wonderland. The songs inculde hardcore pieces ('Good n' Evil'), soft ballads ('Distant Land'), and even campy tunes ('Okey-Dokey'). Every track is a winner, not one fails to loose your intrest. A standout piece includes 'Father's Field', an emotional account of a painful (and true) experience that happened to Lords. Her openess in this song is amazing and reveals a vunerability that isn't very common in techno. Lords has established herself as a true artist, and proven that there's more to a ""Melrose Place"" star than good looks. She's a Madonna for the 21st century! END"
1,utter crap,"even for 1995 this sounds horribly dated. Uses the most cliched ""techno"" sounds you can think of. sounds like bad mc-303 presets. utterly disposable crap. thank god she never made any more. this is techno for people who have no clue what techno is. she shouldve stuck to getting slammed on film. she was much more talented with her legs in the air."
2,some of the girls are disgusting,"When I first heard of this book, I became slightly excited, assuming that it would finally be my entrance into a scene that is somewhat limited when it comes to foreigners. However, upon cracking open this one, I realized that I haven't really been missing much. To be honest, the girls are mediocre at best and stomach churning at the worst. Pick up a good porno mag instead."
4,A non-dual interpretation of The Gospel of Thomas,"In this book, Robert Powell interprets the Gospel of Thomas from a non-dual perspective. What I mean is, he interprets Jesus as an enlightened teacher who is simply pointing to the kingdom of heaven all around you, the oneness of everything. Jesus is saying you are not separate from God, and never were. You need only to drop all religious concepts and see. This is what esoteric Christianity is all about. There are other books about this. 'Inner Christianity' by Richard Smoley is also very good."
5,Mission Accomplished,"I purchased the item to replace the starter motor on my 25-years old Sears lawn tractor. It looks different from the original one and has the electric connector on the opposite side of the casing. However there was no problem with installation and it fit in place just right. 10 minutes later, when I put all parts back in place, the tractor started without any hesitation. Considering the price, I don't expect the new starter to last 25 years like the original one did, but chances are I will not need it for that long anyhow. Very happy with this purchase."
3,Pleasant fairy tale...,"Admittedly I had a lot on my mind when I read this. But to my taste, this rambling fairy story moved very slowly and just barely kept my interest with good period detail. This is about beautiful Elise, whose family died in the Mortality and who was married to the evil Maelgwyn. Travails, travails, travails and yes, she ends up with...ah, can't spoil the ending. If you want really excellent historical detail, find a small book called Down the Common. That's a jewel I still think about a year later. If you want a fairy story, Nectar from a Stone is a pleasant but predictable one."
5,Great Bath Toy,This bath toy is great. It keeps my child entertained and not fussy during bath time...the drawing crayons are great and my daughter enjoys the songs and the piano.I would recommend it for parents to keep their children entertained during bathtime...
2,not a good bath toy,"The crayons dont work well on the mat, the singing and counting is way too fast for someone to learn from and the suction cups do not stay."
3,Please explain this book to me...,"I have to admit it. I do not understand the stories in this book. Its he making them up, or is he just reporting the news storied of the day.The first book I read of his was 'Smile' which was pretty straight forward and enjoyable, so I am not sure what this book is supposed to be. Please fill me in.BTW, I saw Henry go 2:40 minutes in Chicago earlier this year, and it was simply amazing!"
5,Five stars,"Great read by a great man! Pulls you in from the very beginning, it's hard to put down until the end!"
5,A lot of detail,The flip side of the key word is more detailed than I thought. It gives an brief explanation of why the key words are important. I do not like how the book is connected I thought it was flash cards but I think I can get used to it. Great book :D
2,"Wheresooth, Mantooth?","The big, in-most-cases two page layout of these tunes makes for easy reading. It's a great selection of tunes, which is why I bought it in the first place. However, I was really hoping for some creative chord change alternatives. I mean, when I read ""... with professionally altered chords"" my impression was there was some in-depth thinking about substituting the chords from the original. Unfortunately no or at least, not so much."
2,Confortable Adidas Sandals,"I love them... so confortable... even my wife steals tem sometimes from me :)) Use them for inhouse, outhouse I use my Crocs or for more social events my Birkenstocks.20th April 2010Today I'm reviewing my rating... was 5, but now went down to 2... after 6 months of use they started showing small cracks all over... since there are so many small bumps on them (which are kind of nice to keep your blood circulation going), they accumulate dirt and are kind of difficult to clean... after a while start smelling bad.After leaving them in the sun (forgot them for 3-4 hours), they bent completelly and now I can't use them anymore). Won't get them again..."
2,Disappointed,"Although I still occassionally use them, these may be the most uncomfortable sandals I've ever purchased. The top flap is too hard, biting into my skin. The whole sandal seems too rigid and inflexible---I don't find it comfortable at all. It's also too narrow for my foot. The Nike sports sandals I had before were very comfortable, but they've worn out and I can't find new ones online."
3,Runs large,"Not a great shoe for the price. Runs large and hubby did not like the way it stayed on his feet. Have returned, but, still no refund yet."
5,Price and quality OK.,Good fit and quality. Adjustment helps when using with either socks or barefoot.Seven more words required to submit? x x
4,Very Good for Shower and around Hot Tub and Pool,"The shoes are easy on the feet. They don't slip on the world's best but good enough considering either dry or when wet. They provide excellent traction around wet areas. I don't know how long they will last, but I imagine for my limited daily use, I'll get great value."
5,Beautiful and functional!,"This is a lovely garlic keeper -- not too large, not too small. It holds several bulbs of garlic, and the terracotta clay keeps them cool and fresh and inhibits sprouting. The keeper fits perfectly on my countertop and is a joy to look at -- like a little work of art. It is surprisingly well crafted and detailed for such a very reasonable price. This is the nicest garlic keeper I've seen, and I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy it for many years to come."
5,Best garlic keeper,"Best garlic keeper I have owned. Very attractive style and finish, holds two large heads of garlic, or three small ones."
5,Required reading for ALL environmentalists,"It would be a shame if this seminal work on environmental destruction and the environmental movement were pigeonholed as a ""California book."" It is of equal interest to East Coast opinion-makers, Washington policy-makers, and all of those with an interest in environmental protection throughout the state, nation, and internationally. Thoroughly researched, it includes astonishing, little-known facts; but it is also highly accessible, written in lucid prose, blessedly jargon free, and including the telling, memorable anecdote. The photographs are stunning and will have an impact on even the casual browser - so the book will have an effect beyond ""preaching to the choir."" Perhaps most important, the book ends on a high note of hope, describing and lauding those environmental heroes and heroines who have made a genuine difference, one protest movement at a time."
4,A beautiful history of California environmental degradation,"This book beautifully chronicles the damage that has been wreaked upon the California landscape in the last cnetury and a half. Particularly interesting is the commentary about the miner ethos that has prevailed not only among miners but also among loggers, agribusinessmen, and developers, leading to the pillage of the land for the gain of a few. However, the book was also weak here when it contrasted this ethos with that in Italy which has resulted in the preservation of the countryside. It seems only fair that the weaknesses of the Italian system, including the negative impacts of a slower economy and weak central government on the people's well-being, be at least acknowledged here as well. However, all in all the book is still very worthwhile. I will now never be able to forget what this state might have been."
2,Dead on arrival,"Purchased this product from Fry's and their recommended power adapter. Connected it all up; no lights no nothing.I selected this unit primarily for its $15 price tag which was the least expensive unit at the store and it came with cables. Thanks to another review (the only one at the time) I recognized that the $10 power adapter might be necessary since my laptops don't have PS2 connections. The clerk at the store confirmed that when he opened the instructions. Note the instructions also say not to touch the keyboard or mouse during startup to prevent glitches.I'm returning this product and will try a manual switch this time. It is the same cost, but requires no power. I didn't select the manual one initially, because it didn't clearly state the supported resolution, and had no cables."
5,An easy album to review.,"This is quite simple. I have loved the Happy Mondays since the early nineties. Somehow, Black Grape always eluded me. Not until September of 2009 did I even hear it. Song for song I like it a little bit better than any single Monday's album. And I love every Mondays album. Bottom line: if you like the Happy Mondays or Manchester music in general, do your self a HUGE favor and buy this now. What do you have to lose? It's only a penny! (yeah, plus shipping, but hey, it's good for the economy!) ""It's Great when you're Straight...Yeah"" sounds like any Mondays album but with something extra. I'm not a good reviewer, just get it and you'll see what I mean."
3,"Saying ""No"" to Bootlegs","Back in the day, the Ramones were ""captured"" live on any number of bootleg recordings, but it took until the 1990s to find the band issuing a number of live albums.This is the second of three live releases from the decade - recorded on February 29, 1996, at The Academy, NYC - and it features Joey (v), Johnny (g), C.J. (b) and Marky (d). It is roughly one-half the numbers from the show, which was a pretty standard set list for the time period.Two bonus studio tracks - R.A.M.O.N.E.S. and Any Way You Want It - fill out the roughly 34 minutes taken from the performance. The band was about six months away from breaking up after touring virtually non-stop for 22 years.Though the finish line was in sight - with Joey already waging a battle against lymphoma - the band may not have been operating on high-octane fuel by this time, but they were not sputtering on fumes just to stay on the track."
2,Not worth the money,"I got this blow dryer because it is a Chi and usually anything by them is perfect. Well this time they got it wrong.The Pros:*Super super quiet*The air flow isn't strong so it doesn't blow your hair all over the place, but it is still as hot as any other dryer.The Cons:*It doesn't dry any faster than any other blow dryer*For the life of me I could not get it to stay on for more than 2 minutes. It kept on clicking off.I have very thick curly hair and it takes me 20-30 minutes to dry my hair, and 2 minutes is all this thing would give me. After about 10 mins of trying to get it to work (holding in front of my fan to cool it off) i went back to my conair. This is getting packed up and taken back to BB&B; (where I got it for $90)."
4,Nice tip holder,I use bits in my work every day and this holder does a good job at securing them in my driver.
3,Meesa ashamed of this one,"I have come to loathe all things ""Prequel,"" but when the hype surrounding the (then) upcoming Episode I was at its peak, I enthusiastically bought all of Kenner's 12"" figures in the Episode I line, yes, even this Jar Jar Binks (shudder) figure.Pros - This is a pretty good looking figure. It's detailed and has a good head sculpt and outfit.Cons - My gripes have everything to do with the character, not this figure. What can I say? Kenner did a good job here.Despite my feelings about the movie, I have to admit these are some of Kenner's better 12"" Star Wars figures. I still can't bring myself to recommend a Jar Jar Binks action figure, but if you're collecting this series it's not like you can pass it by."
1,Poor Outing,This is the worst BAD CD there is. None of that great sampling and funky beats. What made BAD BAD is missing from this CD. If you want a Clash Album buy this CD.
5,Absolutly perfect.,"This chart has so much info on it, that I was able to pick up on quite a bit of information. It is not like a book you have to carry or turn to a certain page, you just learn at a glance. There is info on both sides of the chart so you can imagine how much they have packed this chart with. Perfect for learning and practice."
3,Didn't Make Its Case,"This IS a story of soul mates reunited, so if you are looking for that angle and like a light read, go with this book. However, this is not the complete story of soul mates. There are plenty of horror stories (not in this book) that would make for a more balanced picture.If you are looking for evidence that only love is real, you are going to want something meatier. Weiss has a lot of snippets of brilliance, but fails to weave them together in a way that leaves you coming away from this feeling like he felt in the moments where he thought, ""Only love is real."" I think the raw material is there, but it just didn't come together well."
4,A Classic Collection,"A good collection of classic cat stories, beautiful photos of beautiful cats, and the incomparable Cleveland Amory is a good addition for the ailurophie's library."
4,It could happen!,"The plot is high improbable, but in a crazy world it could happen. Once again, this young Korean actor, Jang Geun Seok is compelled to grow up and take responsiblity for his life. His interaction with his fellow characters, his inate ability to move from extremes of emotions and his facial expressions are truly what makes him a exceptional young actor. Although the story line is somewhat far-fetched, who could say it wouldn't happen. Just enjoy yourself as a viewer!"
4,Useful,"At the age of 57 in the space of 2 minutues I lost the sight in my right eye due to a vascular event. This book was recommended to me and I read it about 10 days later. As I am a physician most of the concepts were not new to me but they are well laid out and there is no medical jargon. Most of the techniques to compensate for monocular (one eyed) vision are fairly simple and you figure them out for yourself. That said, this book is a very useful guide for the newly one eyed and I would recomend it. It will probably shorten the time it takes to become fully adapted, to the new visual reality."
4,There'll Always Be a Christmas,"This was one of the very first Christmas albumns from my youth. From the time vinyl changed over to CD's I've looked and looked for this title. I was very excited when I discovered it on Amazon, and ordered extra copies to give to my mother and siblings.When I received the package, I played it right away. It sounds just like I remember....except..., there's an extra track.Yes, it sounds petty, but when looking for the nostalgia of one's youth, that extra track spoils the image. The name of the albumn is ""There'll always be a Christmas"" because the last cut was, wait for it, ""There'll always be a Christams""!If you're an Ames Brothers fan, and never had the pleasure of this albumn""back in the day"", This is a great find. It's classic Ames Brothers harmonies will resonate well with fans. But if your like me and like reality to match your memories, the extra track will make this just ones more Christmas CD on the shelf."
2,Grown Ups (2010),"The most disappointing anticipated movie. I love Adam Sandler movies, even You Don't Mess with the Zohan, but this one was just awful. I was very disappointed with this one. I'd say SKIP IT and go watch Pineapple Express or Youth in Revolt, they are a lot better."
2,Too many dumb one like jokes,"This movie should be called ""How many dumb one line jokes can we say per minute.""It seemed there was a dumb joke every 15 seconds. The best way to see this movie is if your drunk!The movie is still ok to see as long as you have lots of beer to drink. Good luck.. :)"
1,I felt embarrased watching this,Really? Seriously? This is amazingly bad. End of story. Don't waste your $4 renting this. Donate it to the library.
1,seriously unfunny,"Somewhere between a routine Disney film from the 60s and Beavis and Butthead, this film was just embarassing for all concerned. The only saving grace is the parade of songs from the 70s. Was the whole thing ad-libbed or was it written by Sandler's 10 year old kid? Just imagine the absolute worst skit you ever saw on SNL and then stretch it out for 90 excruciating minutes. Those involved with this bomb who have a salvageable career had best do something really good fast."
1,don't waste your time,not one joke made me laugh the whole time i was rooting for the movie to pick up but all for not very disappoint in adam sandler and chis rock
5,Looks funny,"I bought this movie for my son as a Christmas present.I have not seen the movie but my son is a big fan ofAdam Sandler. He is always pretty funny, so this will be great."
2,Sandler cashes another paycheck,"In spite of a laugh here and there and a few chuckles, this film is essential a paycheck for the 5 male comedians courtesy of Adam Sandler and his production company. The movie is just 100 minutes of gags and stunts that have little relevance to the bare bones plot. Even the set up is ridiculous. Adam Sandler is a rich talent agent in Beverly Hills and is married to a successful fashion designer played by Salma Heyek. Think about it. Adam Sandler married to Salma Heyek! Who wrote this stuff? Oh yeah, Sandler. Well who let them get away with it? Who produced this wreck? Oh yeah, Sandler."
4,Cute!,Great movie for the whole family to watch!!! Plus I am a big fan of Adam Sandler and Kevin James.
4,"Wonderful, hypnotic, headphones required music","This CD is in my ""heavy rotation"". It's especially great to listen to in headphones, at night, with no lights on. The sound harks back to Galaxy 500 with a harder edge. The lyrics are creative, twisted, and sensual. In ""Lady In the Lake"" you think you're listening to a story about lovers at a lake -- but as the song goes on you get more and more info. about what's really going on and then the line in the chorus ""I'm on the wrong side of the water"" starts to really makes sense.Also, unless I'm mistaken, the lyrics in one song sometimes clarify lyrics in another song ! An album integrated lyrically without being some sort of rock opera. This is one of the few CDs of the past several years that's really caught my attention. I never know for sure why I like certain CDs and not others -- but this one I love."
5,"Very compact, battery lasts a long time","I use this driver every month to fabricate wood handicap ramps, 3"" deck screws into treated lumber. No need to push it hard, just enough to keep the bit engaged. Far fewer stripped screw heads than with regular drills, corded or cordless. The battery has plenty of charge; I have not had to wait for the second battery to finish charging before swapping it in.This is a very strong driver - there is NOT a clutch as you find on drill drivers. In soft wood, the screw head just keeps sinking further into the wood. In hard wood, the screw head will twist off if driven too far. It IS somewhat noisy when the impact feature engages, so you may want to consider ear plugs for continuous use."
5,Background Music for Living,"This CD leaves me feeling peaceful and calm. I listen to it when I'm studying, cooking dinner, or reading on the sofa. It is truly lovely music and I like to think that if my life were a movie, this is the soundtrack upon which it would play."
3,Wiley was better,"The film was fun, more or less faithfully replicating John Wiley's original. Unfortunately, Wiley's graphic/erotic tension was largely missing. The dialog clumsy and unconvincing. Enjoyable, on the whole, but lacking the edge.The most serious problem was technical: voice and image were out of sync. Everyone, not least your customer, deserved better."
3,Getting to the point,"Yes, those scenes you wanted to see that weren't in the original release are there.They're just very very brief.I wanted to see this film after seeing it in Prevue magazine before it was released, and when I finally saw the VHS version, virtually none of the scenes those stills came from were in it. As I said, they're in this version. Although one or two moments from the original cut of the dungeon scene seem to be missing, nothing terribly important is gone.This is a VERY bare bones release. There's nothing in the box except the disk itself. It's mastered in some kind of widescreen format that had me reaching for the format button on my remote. I think on a regular TV you'd be stuck with the Cinemascope effect."
4,the perils of gwendoline in the land of the yik yak,"this is a fun, action movie with tawny kitaen (an ex playmate).imaginative andinteresting and the actors are respectable. an oldie but goodie."
3,Left Behind During Earth's Chaos Period Joke?,"Rather than indulge in premarital or extramarital sexual activity of any kind, in any way shape or form, throughout one's lifetime, should one not marry, view an occasional film such as The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak. Satisfy yourself with the fantasy. Do not indulge in out of wedlock mutually consensual or nonconsensual sexual activity. Regardless how legal or illegal, moral or immoral such activity, or activities throughout your life, you will deeply regret your sexual involvements DURING your life, and, most importantly of all, at the END of life. A few aforementioned words to the wise that will prove true in everyone's life experience. Remember these words if you read them. Richie"
5,Great old songs.,"I have had a copy of this CD for a long time, and love it. Thought I would have a spare copy to share with someone else."
5,Awesome!,"A friend told me about this book and I purchased it the next day. The bookstore only had one copy left so it was definitely meant for me. What an eye opener! I bought the book in 1984, and I still have my original copy which is marked up and dog-eared throughout. It is one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. I found copies in the UK for my friends who fell in love with it (the U.S. copy is bigger than the UK book and has large text). I refer to the Mission often. Was it fact or fiction? You decide. Who cares."
4,"Rosemary Gladstar's Family Herbal: A Guide to Living Life with Energy, Health, and Vitality",ok reading full of information
4,"Nice book, need more though","Ok, I am no writer so will just give my little ol opinion. Book is very nice, tons of great information and wonderful pictures.However, it is not a book if you want to learn how to plant a garden, keep a garden or plant herbs etc..This books is mainly full of information of what herbs do, not what I wanted, but still a lovely book..Now I need to find a book that can help me to grow a nice vegie and herb garden without killing everything;o)"
5,A++++++,"This is a great book chok-full of great information and recipes, many of which you can modify to suit your own tastes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Key Reference,This book is a go to time and time again. The recipes are wonderful and have become a staple in my house.
5,Best Yet,"I think this is one of the best for Clutch, they always seem to reinvent themselves on every album. I just saw them in Columbus, OH and it was the best concert I have ever seen.Having The Bakerton Group open for them was great.I hope the new label will get them the recognition they deserve.I Love the jabs at our current state of society.If you don't know Clutch, you need to.Hidyman (New World Samurai)"
5,This album absolutely kicks @ss.,"This album rocks, and it rocks hard. In my opinion, this is hands-down Clutch's best effort to date.Blast Tyrant almost feels like a crossover album to me. There is no doubt that existing Clutch fans will dig this in a big way, but it is also their most accessible album ever. I think Clutch was definitely an acquired taste before this release, but now even the uninitiated can pick this up and enjoy it right away.Now it's not perfect, as some of the lyrics will leave you scratching your head:""Condoleeza Rice is nice, but I prefer a-roni...""Are you serious? Wow, that's bad. But the music more than makes up for it as they drive an awesome hard beat throughout.This is a can't miss for Clutch fans."
4,Classic,"Energetic, Classic, And Revolutionary. A throw back band with an edgy sound. Nobody pulls it off like Clutch. Southern stoner rock, meets metal, meets classic rock. Kicks arse."
3,Lyrical Political Garbage/Music is Awesome,"Im sorry, but this has to be the 100th album with tacky political lyrics in the past 3 years. But then again, maybe im just an idiot for loving ""Pure Rock Fury"" That was a fun creative album. This one is just plain depressing. With anti war, anti Christian, Anti Bush and just plain gloom and doom all around. Just read the lyrics, Cluth sure feels the end of the world is coming unless John Kerry is president. Sorry but to me, almost all politicians are full of themselves, at least their are those artists out there who see both sides, and not only one. This has been a political rant provided to you by the athiest republican, a breed all his own just looking to hear some kick ass music and not worry about POLITICS!!!!!!!! on either side my friends.. but maybe if it was possible to edit all the lyrics and just listen to the music, this album would be greatest instrumental album ever made. Enjoy!"
3,"Non-mainstream is good, but I resent this album!!!!!","Reminds me that this band is been around since 1991 like Fear Factory has been around since 1990. Most bands have died dead by now but Clutch's self-titled effort is better than this piece of elongated crap here. Gave it up after awhile and waiting for the Robot Hive / Exodus album to come out. Keep trying????? Met mainstream after the millenium then kaput. Cheers, fellas [[[[:-|"
2,too much to read,"bought this book to help with my LADC test, lots of good tidbits, and history in it, but GOD, nothing in here was on that test, if you want some good trivia to bore people with at the next party, get it. other than that, you probably wont need it."
1,"If I could rate it lower, I would","I'm the type of person who will keep a book, even if I have no intention of reading it, because you never know when it will come in handy. Since I have enough wood stockpiled for my fireplace this winter, I'll be taking this one back.The most frustrating thing about this is the constant ""ATM is great, as long as other technologies don't advance, don't become cheaper, and retain their current popularities."" Additionally, the fact that this book was written five years ago, and refers to ""upcoming plans for later implementations as late as 1998"" makes me wonder just how much of technology mentioned in the book is not even valid anymore."
2,Shallow and Repetitious,"If you think you won't be able to understand ATM, this book will help you fulfill your prophecy. It avoids detail to the point of being useless - as a result it has nothing substantial to talk about. Reading it is like reading a collection of sales brochures.I wasted a lot of time on this book - please do yourself a favor and find a real book on ATM."
3,Good,"Algenfish good album, but only for those who are even fan Shirley Manson , Garbage, only so in my opinion"
5,Not Garbage....,"Like many who have already reviewed this album, I too was interested in this album due to Shirley Manson's part in it.At first, I must say, I wasn't much into the music of Angelfish; but after a few listens I definately started to latch onto it. I'd actually have to say, that some of these songs remind me of Blondie.The lyrics are morbidly up-beat, and the music itself is quite catchy. I'd give this album a try..."
3,Precursor to a superstar icon!,"I was already a huge Garbage fan when I got this album for Christmas in 1999, so naturally I was excited to see how Shirley's former band compared to the popular and critically acclaimed band I love today. Lesson learned: Do not expect this to be as good as Garbage. It can't compare. That being said, it's still a really cool, moody rock album, that still showcases Shirley's fantastic smoky vocals. Garbage fans will probably enjoy the primal ""Dogs In A Cage"", ""Suffocate Me""(the song that attracted Butch Vig's attention to Shirley when it aired on MTV), and the wild ""Mummy Can't Drive"". The album ends with a bang with the appropriately titled ""The End"". Any Garbage fan should buy this, not only because they will enjoy it but because it is very interesting to hear Shirley at this point, unaware that she was just two years away from becoming a global rock n' roll icon. Shirley's vocal style is what makes this album unique, I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
5,Cheesy popcorn seasoning,"When I couldn't find this product in my grocery store or other stores I shop in I decided to check out Amazon and yea, it was here! My husband and I love this seasoning on our popcorn, really good!!! Speedy delivery, thanks!!"
3,ok but extends beyond lamp. Skip this wattage and go for the higher wattage for more comfort.,"It works ok but it extends beyond the cover of our fixture in the ceiling (about 1/4""+). You should go ahead and get the higher wattage as I find 125 W is not enough to make a difference when you come out of the shower or bath."
3,Just a collection,"This duo epitomised the ""california sound"" This album is okay but nothing spectacular. The few songs that were hits are great but there could have been more hits on this CD. Definitely just a ""Collection"""
1,One more negative vote,"I was hoping to come here and post a review to warn everyone away from this book, but it looks like about two dozen people have beaten me to it. I am an avid sci-fi reader and the description on this book had me excited. Interstellar travel! Alien artifacts! Colonization! These are all subjects that I enjoy the heck out of. But I couldn't get past the very explicit sexual references in this book. And coming from me, a self-professed pervert, this is a resounding denouncement. By page 20, I had been confronted with at least 5 explicit images that would give a trashy romance novel a run for its money. But unlike a romance novel, most of these images were dark, disturbing, and fairly pathological. I'm the last person to want to sensor a book, so if you're into filthy, detailed descriptions of sexual vice, this is the book for you. But if you'd prefer a good story that provokes thought and doesn't rely on shock value, steer clear of this not-so-great book."
1,Needlessly complicated and filled with fluff,"I purchased this book to review for our language school's ESL program. Though it is a useful tool in presenting all of the complexities of the English verb, as a practical tool for ESL students I cannot recommend it. It is needlessly complicated in its format. The book contains unusual and infrequent English verbs, such as ""to cleave"", ""to yes"" or ""to be hemmed."" It even provides two conjugations for ""to hide,"" one meaning to conceal and one meaning to beat. However, this difference is noted only at the bottom of the page. These sorts of verbs permeate this book. It seems that English has plenty of high frequency verbs that make inclusion of so many bizarre and passive voice verbs unnecessary. This book bears little resemblance to its excellent cousins in the series: 501 French or Spanish verbs."
4,Very useful,"Conjugating verbs is not as easy as it seems (lay, had lain?...). What 501 English Verbs does is show you how to conjugate a verb so you don't sound like a hillbilly. Especially useful for irregular verbs."
1,501 English Verbs (Barron's w/CD),Never received nothing either the refund. I would not buy never kindenly another time. It was very bad experience. I called customer service and nothing.
2,Best of Al Martino,This CD should have been remastered. It has a flat sound and little or no stereo effect. It is very disappointing. Look for the remastered version of all his greatest hits.
5,Something For Everyone,"Planning a holiday party? Don't exactly have much to choose from your collection of music as far as Christmas music? Get this Billboard Greatest Christmas Hits 1935-1954 AND the followup 1955-Present. You can't go wrong, all tunes are major hits and extremely recognizable; and these 2 collections are enough to start your collection of Christmas tunes. So get them both and have a blast!"
3,Van Damme always gets his man,"I loved this movie when it first came out, so when I saw it cheap I had to buy it, only to be a little disappointed. It certainly wasn't as good as I had remembered it being. It is very early nineties in every way. Van Damme's acting is just dreadful, but that comes as no surprise, no-one watches his movies for his acting abiliteis. All of his awesome martial arts moves are here, along with his corny one-liners. It is sad that his stunt double was obviously used quite regularly.There are a couple of other good performances by Ron Silver as the bad guy, and Mia Sara as the love interest, who is so tiny, Van Damme could snap her in half. This one is for fans only, for anyone else it is merely just lost in time."
3,Abuse of power versus the need to bend rules for right.,"Jean Claude Van Damme's chracter of TE agent Max Walker has a terrible quandry, break his time travel agency's rule of no one goes back to the past to alter the future to save his murdered wife from a slimy and unethical Senator from his own time(2004), or stay in the future and allow his time travel agency's head, Senator Aaron McComb, take over the agency and the presidency by altering the future for the greedy benefit. This ethical dilemnia forms the basis of the plot,I think, for the movie. Forget the bad language, just focus on the love story between Walker and his wife, played by Mia Sara."
2,Gotta give the ppl what the ppl really want.,"Well in the beginning of the early dvd stages movie studios were adepting anyways. I had this film on laserdisc and its orgnial oar was 2.35:1 so whats the problem universal. As many films in there library the shadow also was in widescreen in laserdisc also maybe in the future universal will start producing more titles in there widescreen products. Even more studios double dipping these days thats what i call a re-release of a film special editions blah blah better late then never right or trying to make the ppl spend more money when they double dip or dont wanna spend the extra time and quaily and money even bad movies get nice transfers look at the newly released gymkata geez. But universal its 2007 jump on the widescreen bandwagon from all the older release you've released from the beginning twins,timecop,the shadow,kindergaten cop,i'm putting faith in you now give the ppl what the ppl really want thanks for reading."
4,surprisingly good,"when i first saw this i was expecting another predictable, timetraveler movie, filmed entiarly in the present time. i was wrong. it was spred out, throughout the past, present and future, and left you guessing till the end."
5,Timecop - a classic!,"I love this film when it first come out on the big screen, i have owned the VHS version aswell as the DVD too but when i found out this was coming out on HD DVD, i was baffled as i thought maybe this film would look good in quality as old film transfers dont look the best in 1080p, however, this film looks brillaint in detail, obviouslt dont expect modern HD quality images but for a classic film turned HD, it looks brilliant, better than most old film transfers!Only grudge is that it doesnt have any special featured :("
3,LUNATIC INDIE ROCK DANCE HALL,"Brooklyn-based dance punk you can DANCE to. Catchy, bouncy, will make you shake your hips and smile. Less abrasive Les Savy Fav meets a less heady Mission of Burma. DANCE, DANCE, DANCE"
3,Children of the Corn V,"Although the COTC movie series is a great series, this particular movie is in my opinion the worst one of the series. I have seen all of the others and my personal favorite is the first one; so if you're thinking of watching one, watch the first one."
4,Great watch.,"I have used Casio Databank watches for many years. I bought this one to replace a DBC150, which does not seem to be available anymore. While I would have prefered the 150 for its countdown-timer, this watch is a fine and the price was right."
4,Casio Databank is a great buy,"Casio databank is a great fit for any wrist or any budget. Love the ease of use where you can get your favorite phone numbers, tell time around the world or time your jog.I've loved these Casio's for years and the price just keeps getting better."
4,CASIO WATCHES-GREAT ON YOUR WRIST,"WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED CASIO MENS DATABANK DIGITAL WATCHES, I WORKED AT A MOTION PICTURE STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD. I NEEDED A METHOD OF KEEPING PACE WITH THE BUSY STUDIO AROUND ME. I NEEDED INSTANT PHONE NUMBERS ON MY WRIST, TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT TALENT. THE VARIOUS ALARMS TO WARN ME OF COMING EVENTS WAS SO HELPFUL. THE STOP WATCH FEATURE WAS INVALUABLE WHEN I WAS TIMING SHOWS, COMMERCIALS, AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE SHOWS I WAS EDITING. THE WORLD TIMES AROUND THE WORLD HELPED IN KNOWING WHAT TIME SOMEONE ELSE IN ANOTHER TIME ZONE WAS FACING WHILE WE DISCUSSED WHEN THEY WOULD GET ME VARIOUS SHOWS, AND COMMERCIALS. I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED MY CASIO DATABANK WATCHES BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDABLE. I HAVE PROBABLY GONE THROUGH 5 OR 6 WATCHES, SOMETIMES WEARING 2 AT THE SAME TIME, JUST TO KEEP UP WITH THE FAST ACTION OF THE CARTOON VOICES I WAS EDITING! THANK YOU CASIO! THANK YOU AMAZON FOR GREAT PRICES!"
5,Very Versatile,"I have used this model of Casio Databank Digital Watch for over 20 years. In my agricultural business, my watch is exposed to temperature extremes, water, dirt, and impact abuse at times. It has always performed flawlessly. I routinely use the calculator and stopwatch functions for important calibrations we use for monitoring irrigation equipment and fertilizer and chemical calibrations. I used the telephone index and calculator years before cell phones with these functions were in existence. I still rely on my Casio for more than just telling time on a daily basis. This is a wonderful watch!"
1,Did not receive order,Did not receive order. Ship to address was my previous address not my current address. Did not notice this when order was placed.My mistake. CD ordered at same time from another vender was forwarded. This order was not.Should add that credit was issued and situation was resolved without difficulty. No complaint against dealer. Just a mix-up.
1,If you've heard one.......,"I was curious about this band having heard their ""Paranoid"" cover which sounded ok (Probably because Black Sabbath pounded that song into my head forcing me to like any black sabbath cover song) But, listening to this cd is like listening to any other rap/rock album out there. It's all the same. If you want decent ""Nu-metal"" (I hate using that term) You should check out Deftones(Adrenaline), Korn(Korn, Life is Peacy) hedPE(self-entitled)I strongly recommend you check out Kyuss or Monster Magnet. Now there's music to listen to.... forget 3rd Strike, Linken Park, Incubus, Creed, Limp Bizkit, or anything else those poppy buttock kids listen to these days......"
5,All of you making fun of this Cd are funny guys!,"I don't get what's so bad about this cd. Yes it is Rap/Metal, but there is no other Nu-Metal That has this much melody and GREAT singing. Lisa, No Light and Redemtion are 3 of the best songs I've ever heard. The only song I don't like on this cd is ""Flow Heat"" It's WAY TOO Limp Bizkit gone Deftones."
3,Worth a listen,"I found this CD average or a little above. It sounds like Sublime and Suicidal Tendencies jammed together one day. It is very melodic at points, and very thrash metal at others. I must say, I enjoy the singer's voice a lot, and he is very versitile. He has a good singing voice, and can yell with the best of them. It is not terribly original, but done well."
4,"mythic characters, hillarious stories","Like many of McManus' readers, I am neither a hunter of a fisher (Though I have fished a couple of times). What draws me to McManus are the near mythic characters he has created in his works. McManus puts these charaters in all kinds of unfortunate but hilarious situations. Years after first reading some of them, they are still with me. McManus is one of the true literary geniuses of our time. The stories of ""A Fine and Pleasant Misery"" are a prime example of this. Get it for yourself and see if I'm telling the truth."
5,Laugh Out Loud,"I bought the book for my father who luckily already had it and gave it to me. Makes you really remember what it was like being a kid playing outside...yes, I actually did laugh out loud - over and over! My 8 year old son wants me to read him the short story ""The Two-Wheel ATV"" repeatedly."
3,ok,when I was putting one of the hub caps it cracked right in the middle not all that ok for the price
5,Nice external battery,"I found this product to work very well, lasting about 3 hours after the initial charge, certainly long enough to view a DVD movie. As others have mentioned, there is no light to indicate the pack is charging or fully charged, so just have electronic faith when you plug it in and give it 12-24 hours to charge completely. It will be slightly warm after charging. I like that it comes with several different plug in tips - it will work with either of my portable DVD players. It's also a convenient size for traveling."
4,Great Battery,"This is a helpful item. I bought two on sale. The batteries I have give a good 4-5 hours. It works for me since most of the smaller portable DVD player batteries only last a couple hours. Overall, worth having just in case of power outage or long travel. Wish they'd go on sale again soon. My only two gripes are that they could have colored the charge outlet, so it can be seen easier and added a charging light/meter so you know when the battery is fully charged. Make sure your charge a good 24 hours prior to using. Enjoy."
3,NO DATA FOR DATABANK,"NO INSTRUCTIONS CAME WITH THIS DATABANK WATCH. IMPOSSIBLE TO USE ALL THE FEATURES WITHOUT THE INSTRUCTIONS. LUCKILY I HAD A SIMILAR MODEL BEFORE AND I REMEMBERED WHERE I PUT THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT...AND THEY APPEAR TO HAVE COVERED EVERYTHING THIS MODEL CAN DO, IT IS WORKING FINE"
3,Casio databank,"Pros:This watch have enough room to store many names and number, good design.cons: size characters are not equal to read the name and phone.do not have password protection, anyone can view the numbers stored."
2,"Come on, Casio!","Casio still doesn't get it:--Why have a gizmo that can store 300 memos without providing for data backup via a PC link?--Why do away with perhaps the most useful function--schedule memos--aside from telling time?--Why make people scroll through a list for a calculator math function? They had this right in the older models, but are going backwards in terms of feature set!Definitely a waste of money."
4,Great watch,"I had another metal casio calculator watch for about 7 years. Since they don't make the other model any more, this is the replacement I chose. It is very stylish and functional. Although the format is very complicated, it can be learned with the aid of the quite thick instruction manual. It actually took me several hours to get it set like I wanted. Note: there are no instructions on how to adjust the band, which is somewhat difficult.There are really far more features in this watch than I will ever need. I just wanted a good time piece that displays a 24-hour clock, a calculator and a backlight. This watch contains much, much more than this. It is really overkill for a watch."
1,Pictures are best component,Disappointing content. Pictures are nice but not worth more than a quick browse.
2,hmmmmm,"I was disappointed in this toy, it is boring! The baby fish don't fit in the big fish's mouth, so I don't know why it's called a fill and spill. The little fish are cute and are finger puppets which is kind of neat if you have small children, but that's about all the positives I can say about this toy. The big fish fell apart the same day we got it, and it was only played with for 5 minutes. My son has no interest in any part of this toy, so I gave the little fish to my dogs...they like them!"
4,Oxford Regional Economic Atlas,"This book is out of print and very dated, but it still is chock full of useful information on where the Untied States and Canada produce their regional economies. I've had this book since I took a geography course at the University of Minnesota twenty years ago. Nearly every map is in serious need of revision and updating, but the concept of the atlas is sound and valid.The maps range from physical to dot maps indicating tomato and cotton production, non-ferrous metal mining, transportation, and climate. No geographer should be without something that supplies this essential information.Again, the information presented here has its limitations, but if this is available at a garage sale or used bookstore, its worth the dollar or so charged."
2,Chinese Junk,"It opens cans just fine, but I wonder if any of the other reviewers tried to actually sharpen a knife with it? The knife sharpener doesn't work, it doesn't spin at all. I opened up the can opener to see if I could fix it and the stone is fixed on a plastic hex shaft that is part of the blow molded case. There's no way the stone was made to spin, I guess the Chinese figured we would just spit on our knives and run them over the stone by hand. There's a shaft coming out of the motor but it's too short the even touch the stone, it was never meant to spin. I guess I'm off to Wal-Mart to get an opener with a knife sharpener that really works, too much of a hassle to send this back for what I paid for it."
1,Garbage - Do Not Buy,"Received this item today and has no driver support.Windows XP couldn't find anything to make this work.Complete waste of money and time.Item wasn't even shipped by BestDealUSA, but rather eShopic.com"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"As with all the others, it does NOT work. It is either hit or miss with these adapters. Cost more to send back than to it is worth. Threw it in the trash. Best way to get a working adapter is to take your computer (if possible) to the store and keep trying one until you find one that works. That is what the salesman at the local computer store told me to do and after trying several I found one that works. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
1,Does not work at all with Vista,The product does not come with Vista drivers. I contacted the seller and they don't seem to have them either. The listing needs to make clear that this product is for legacy systems only.
2,"Will not work with Vista, good luck searching for Drivers- FIXED NOW!","Title pretty much says it. The cable is a ""no name"" Chinese product. Which is fine! Only trouble is that the drivers DO NOT work with Vista, and since there's no company name easily found on the product or packaging you'll have a real hard time trying to find drivers.On the other hand, it does seem to be a fine product as far as the cable istelf goes. If you don't have Vista, it may work just fine for you!UPDATE- This has been resolved. The company apparently got a driver together and Microsoft pushed it as part of their ""Problem Reports and Solutions"", so it just started working one day. Seems to do exactly what it's supposed to do now, and I would probably increase it's star rating if the edit function here would let me."
1,Non-Functional Item,"Purchased this product because of its good price but, as others have found, I quickly learned that it does not actually function to connect my Serial Magellan GPS to Windows Vista. Returned for refund. Purchased the TRENDnet product which seems to work with both vista and GPS devices with no trouble. Save yourself the hassle and pay a little more for a better product."
5,Hard to find electronic cables and adaptors,Got an electronic cable or adaptor that's a little out of the ordinary? You can find it right here on Amazon.com with just a few clicks!
4,Bermuda Depths,"Thank you so much for shipping quickly and shipping great merchandise, But the movie sucked!! Im not downing on you and your company, I just didnt like the movie. So if you feel like wasting a bunch of time and have absolutely nothing else to do, this is the movie for you.Thank you again for your quality merchandise and prompt timing!!"
2,Would be great costume - if it included what it said it did,"My daughter had been bugging me for this costume for weeks. She was so excited to have found it on Amazon.com, but imagine her disappointment when only half of it arrived. It was supposed to ship with a dress, headband, wings and tail -- but all that arrived is the dress.We're returning it now and are reordering (hoping this was just an isolated error), but be warned if you plan on ordering this close to Halloween that it may not be what was promised (and then it will be too late to exchange)."
1,horrible!,"it didn't fit, it tore on halloween! it has cheep fabrick! don't buy it! it is not comfortable at all!"
3,A good basic watch,"This is a good basic watch that can hold quite a bit of info, like phone numbers. But it is not up to the same standard as some of the more expensive Casio databank watches. I use this one while playing sports and it's just the thing. This watch would be good for a kid, too."
5,Hasbro Does It Again,The recent Star Wars line has mixed playability and likeness perfectly and the Royal Starship is a perfect example. While gorgeous enough for display it's huge enough to play with for hours at a time. The different features are too numerous to mention which is the first time in 25 years I've ever experienced that. All in all an outrageously excellent effort.
3,Smaller than you'd think from the pictures.,I'm in the military and use real aviator kit bags all the time on jumps and simply for packing my gear. The only problem with these bags is that they are half the size of what an actual aviator kit bag should be.
4,I'd rather have this,"I've never been a Springsteen fan, it was the Dave Edmunds track (reportedly never recorded by Bruce) that got me to buy (I'll buy just about anything with Edmunds on it). I don't have any need to buy any Bruce, since this is a 'best of' in (I admit) a bizarre sort of way."
2,Product not provided as listed.,"This product requires an interactive CD as listed. It did not come with one. When assistance was requested, I was told they could do nothing about providing the CD as was listed, but they could give me a 50% rebate, which I accepted as better than nothing. Still, clearly listing it for sale with the CD, then not providing a CD, and claiming that there is nothing they can do to get a CD even though that is what they claim to be selling, is pretty much bait and switch. :("
3,I was hoping for more,"Coming as it does at the conclusion of Stephen's days with the Buffalo Springfield, I was hoping for a little more."
3,"seriously, it's not THAT great","Look at all the other reviews of this disc. They either say ""I love Crosby, Stills, and Nash's music, so I love this"" or they say ""I love Stephen Stills' music, so I love this."" But what would you say if you didn't already know this music from its later, more polished versions? You'd hear a good but occasionally sloppy guitarist singing folky, country-tinged songs, about half of them of very good quality. Some of these songs didn't show up in his later records for a good reason: they're dull. These demo versions of ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes"" and ""Helplessly Hoping"" are well worth a listen, but ""Wooden Ships"" has often been performed better."
5,Best concert ever!,This collection is awesome. The DVD has one of the best concerts you will ever see. The choreography is perfect. Madonna does songs from old albums and new ones with never before heard remixes. You will love it. I absolutely love the remix of the song Erotica.
4,Should have been 5 stars....,"This is a superb concert - simple as that. The DVD loses a point for having 4x3 menus though!! it is SOOOOOOO annoying and very VERY strange! My TV is set up to auto-zoom 4x3 material to fill the (16x9) screen - this works great for me except on this disc the buttons on the main menu disappear off the bottom of the screen! I have to change the aspect ratio every time i go to the menu. Never in my life have I heard of a widescreen DVD having 4x3 menus! But, aside from this annoyance, this is a truly excellent DVD/CD combo. Fantastic value for money too. Buy it - you won't regret it!"
5,Best live show ever?,"This CD is definitely worth buying - just for the DVD that comes with it. Fantastic live-show from Pop Queen drifting into dance/club/hip-hop rhythms, with 16:9 aspect ratio and DTS surround sound. Must have - not only for die-hard fans..."
2,Confessions from a wannabe fan.,The production quality is high but the dance routines are too much distraction. I have never been a big Madonna fan but I do enjoy many of her songs. For me the songs stand alone and do not need the overdone glitz.
5,Best show I ever saw!,I saw this tour in person in Philadelphia so I just had to get the dvd. Again this is the best show ever! I love Madonna!
5,Madonna is still the Queen.,I have always been a huge fan of Madonna since the first time she appeared on the scene in the 1980's. While not all of her albums since then have been great at the same time they haven't been horrible. This collection we have the live version of some of her songs and an great dvd showing Madonna at what she does best....Entertaining a crowd. She is a charismatic and provocative performer. She may not be the most talented singer or songwriter but she is a great entertainer!
5,AMAZING!!,"Amazing memories of the most amazing Madonna's show to date. I got the chance to see this concert on July 23 in Miami, it was just an great experience. This DVD is totally worth it. And if your not a Madonna fan, you might become one after seeing this show. Play it really loud on your home theater, and you'll feel like you're right in there back in the concert!!!"
1,misguiding,"Fans of Mr Vargas' singing will probably be satisfied.His voice is beautiful, well educated and this repertoire is most apt to show it to advantage. His technique is good (some problems with pianos), his agility commendable.People looking for an adequate rendering of old arias will find this compilation lacking instead: he chooses (as declared in the booklet) to ignore philological and stylistical issues, singing them beautifully but also romantically, as late Donizetti or early Verdi. Problem is that this, to educated ears, sounds incredibly wrong, nearly inaudible.A pity: with more attention (much more attention) to style this could have been a useful compilation for singing students too. Such as it is, it is only good for Mr Vargas' fans if at all."
2,"Good idea, weak execution","Light, comfortable, well made-- but not durable for active use. The internal metal plates that make it shapable crimp and break with use/wear. Once broken the metal edges were not comfortable, creating sharp lumps in the otherwise comfortable strap and band areas. Replaced with more expensive, less comfortable leather model within two weeks of use. If you can put it on, and not re-shape it much, it will probably be a wonderful tool, if not you will only be frustrated by what it isn't-- durable."
1,Freekey's CD Sucks,"This cd is wack. Freekey can't rap. 2 or 3 good songs, if that many. If it goes gold blame it on the marketing. Cause it can't because it's hot. Hell Rell's Eat With Me Or Eat A Box Of Bullets mixtape is better than Freekey's. ...and I like Dipset, but this cd is garbage."
3,Better than I thought,"Not as bad as it could've been since Freekey really isn't a rapper, but it's not bad or great, somewhere in the middle. Guest appearances by JR Writer & Hell Rell make it worth a listen, but Freekey's lyrics are definitely the worst out of Dip Set. His skits & overall comedic tone throughout the album show a lighter side, but are mostly just filler. Stand out tracks are ""Shoot 'Em Up"" & ""Daddy Back"", but that's about it."
5,"Grease Band needs no ""Help"" from Friend Joe Cocker","The guys who helped Joe Cocker smoke Woodstock1 have put together their own bag of tricks on Leon Russell's Shelter label. From the first ethereal chords to the last pounding bass of 'Down Home Mama', this disc is a delight for fans of gospel, RnB, Rockabilly and good ol' southern boogie (these guys are Limeys, I swear). The lead picker went on to tour with McCartney and the bass player wrote 'I'm Sorry Babe' for the dance outfit Kokomo. A show opening for Rod, Ron & the Faces' 1st tour (70?, Municipal Auditorium, Atlanta) is still spoken of with awe by those who can remember! ..."
4,High Octane Driven Piano,"This cd is a bit different from the original vinyl - but not much, the raw energy and pure joy of thumpin the hell out of the ol' pee-ann-nee shines thru' the speakers, especially at a million or so decibels (try it, you'll see that I'm right). This is definitely NOT for the faint hearted, although in sayin that, there are very beautiful lyrics coursin thru' this album like golden threads thru' a tapestry.A grand introduction by Leon !As a cockney Vulcan once said...Live long an prosper ol' son!!"
1,Skullcandy Junk Headphones,"These Skullcandy headphones broke 5 days after the expiration of the 30 day return policy. The bass rattles and sound is terrible. They are junk. Since they were ordered for Christmas and we celebrated late, the return policy had expired by the time they broke and we cannot return them. We are out over $50 and would not recommend Skullcandy brand to anyone. 30 day return policy on junk electronics is not acceptable. I will not by Skullcandy brand again, especially from Amazon with their 30 day policy.Skullcandy SCS-SCBP3.5 Skullcrushers Subwoofer Stereo Headphones (Black Pinstripe)"
1,Didn't believe bad reviews :((((,"I just got the headphones. Opened the package (took me about 10 min). Plugged them in and.........what??? Those bad reviews which I did not believed in blew out in my head. The sound is CRAP!!!! That subwoofer works like a plastic can!!!! Not loud AT ALL!!! VERY VERY bad sound!!!!! So u ether buy expensive ones like Bose or use the earbuds which are way better. So, those bad reviews are true!!! Returned them right away"
4,Loved them,Bought them for my son for Christmas. He runs heavy construction equiptment. He said they block out most of the noise and he loved the base element..really appreciated how they folded up to be put away.
2,good bass but not much else,"I bought these headphones to use them at work. I tried them before and was quite impressed, but could not use my own player and music samples then.After normal use it was clear that they are all about bass reproduction. The bass was impresive, but higher frequencies were muffled. The sound insulation was poor. The folding design make them fit awkwardly and uncomfortably.I returned them and tried other models instead."
4,Great Experience!,"Great product, high quality, works well. Not a fan of the battery pack, gets in the way a lot but no big deal. shipped quickly, half the price of what Target offers."
2,Not Your Grandma's typical Headphones,"I bought these in hopes of getting a great superb sound with great base..... ***Do not buy these*** if you like listening to different Genre's of music. These will not work with classical, pop or jazz. These Headphonese are strictly for {{{{BASSSEEE}}}}. Without the Base turned on these are basic .99cent from the corner store headphones. Don't waste your money on these..... invest in some good quality headphones. Spend the time and do some research, I must say my kids love these though..... go figure, not a total waste after all... (*.^)...."
3,Overrated!,"If you try them out in the store display they sound awesome... orgasmic! But honestly I don't know if they're running on a higher quality sound system. First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was the Bass Amplified Subwoofer device. I have to put a battery in it just to get the bass to work and its also cumbersome to where it needs its own clip. So imagine listening to music on your phone or ipod, changing music, having this piece attached to another part of your body that your listening device must also clip onto, changing the settings on the clip, unclipping, clipping, etc. Oh yeah, without the device sound is like from a cheap pair of headphones and one side is weaker than the other. I'm returning mine immediately."
2,"Not bad headphones, but the bass is a gimmick","I got these headphones relatively cheap. They're fairly compact, lightweight, and comfortable. The sound is okay, but the bass is way overhyped. The subwoofer amp takes a single double-a battery, and has a wheel to adjust the bass levels. If it's not turned on, the bass is nearly absent. If it is turned on, it's muddy and thumping. It literally tickles to wear because the headphones are vibrating so much. My daughter loves to wear them and have me pump the bass to full because of the tickle effect. I have a pair of ATH-M50s that I bought for $110, and they richness of the sound is a million times better.tl; dr: if you're buying for comfort and mobility, these aren't bad for the price. If you're buying for sound, especially for bass, get something else."
4,good for price,Skullcandy SCS-SCBP3.5 Skullcrushers Subwoofer Stereo Headphones (Black Pinstripe)Saw a lot of reviews on these. To be honest they are.good for the $33 I paid for them butfor retail value $70 is ridiculous for these. They are very comfortable to wear for many hours. Iwith the woofers these are amazing the bass hits hard and the vocals are pretty clear. They.aren't very sturdy they are made.of cheap plastic but if u aren't throwing them in a gym bag carelessly then they will last.Without the battery the headphones suck worst than the free ipod ones. My advice is to buy them with the 120 av adapter compatibility which enables u to listing with subwoofers without a battery. All in all I love them but only because how cool the bass and style not because of sound quality.
5,Absolutely Awesome,"If you are the average or even above average music listener, these are great! When I got them I was so excited but when I listened to music with them for the first time I literally was jumping around, (crazy I know). Some people may not like them and some may love them like I do, it depends on the person but these are awesome and the bass is absolutely amazing, phenomenal! I have never heard such bass, I know that it gets help from the sub-woofer which is attached and it is great. In addition to everything, the music does not leak! I hate when I'm listening to music and others around me are disturbed and telling me to turn down my music but with these you do not have to worry about it. Long story short, they are great, especially for the money. I originally wanted beats by dr. dre but was not willing to spend all of that money on headphones so I got these and I am beyond satisfied."
2,Painting problem,"So, I bought an authentic Skullcandy snoop signature headphone. Great, cuz i'm a big fan of snoop. The sound quality is good nough for the price. But here comes the problem. After 2 months, the painting on the headphone start to lose. And the cheap plastic material that made this headphone started to show up, which is really really really ugly. After another month, the connection in the middle of the headphone is broken. So, I cannot wear them. I tried to use glue, but it wouldn't last long. So, If you really looking to get a headphone that can stay with you for years, don't go with this pair. Instead, get the beats pro. or mixr. If you don't mind the looking, get those professional sennheiser, AKG, Beyer dynamics, they definitely make better headphones. Though beats sucks."
1,Oportunity of improvement,"I live in Costa Rica, i was buy this product 1 week ago, and the subwoofer dead, the sound without the amplifier is terrible, the cable have a circuit, you move it and the sound dissapear.$50 to the garbage.I'll to reparing, because the process for devolution and warranty from costa rica is to long."
5,Right for the money,They are priced right for the performance and quality.Quality of sound is good and the head phones are wirth the money.
4,Sometimes they WOW me sometimes they DONT,"Let me start by saying that if ur into listen to Salsa or Merengue these are flat out INCREDIBLE, they just seem to be soo compatible with that style of music. That's what gives me the WOW factor. Now when it comes to RAP, thats when it tends to become inconsistant. Some songs are right on point but it seems like most songs sound either too low or the bass is too distorted. The low volume is evident when out in the hustle and bustle of the city, buses, trains, sirens, crackheads, etc. But seriously if ur into the Latin music TWO THUMBS WAY UP, RAP is hit or miss. Overall not bad for the price I dont regret getting them I just wished the Rap tracks had the same feel as the latin ones."
2,Not great - save your money,"So, I purchased these thinking they would be an upgrade to my skullcandy brand ear buds, the ink'ed ones. Anyway, while it is an upgrade it didn't last. I have had them less than a month and already managed to get a rattle in the speakers when any level of bass is applied.I will be going back to my ""cheap"" ear buds and these will be going in the trash."
2,Cheap,Well I got them had them for a week loved them but I was listen to a song with little bass and when I turned the volume up a little got a really harsh sound from both headphones changed the song and found it even worse so I sent them back got another pair same thing in the middle of a song so I wasn't being hard on them at all so they are good while they last but very cheaply made
3,paid to much at best buy,"i bought the skull crushers at best buy and paid 70.00 after seeing on this site they could have been had for as low as 25.00, so i feel i paid to much. i am an audiophile and bought these to use with my tv and i like them very much for that. especilly for action movies the subs bring out even small sounds like engines idling and the explosions are great. I also use them for gaming and it is cool i can actually hear enemies in the game walking up behind me.For listening to music the bass is muddy and i have to adjust the bass volume alot. the music does not have the depth and width and clarity it should have. i like them for what they are and i did not expect more."
1,Avoid,"Avoid buying these headphones, there great if you like bass and only bass. Music quality is poor after that. The other thing that I didn't care for is there is an additional piece on the cord that boost the bass with volume control and which requires a AA battery."
3,Some Product Flaws,"Great headphones, but the bass amplifier on my pair hardly worked, and required a new battery seemingly every other day."
2,No good,"the subwoofer sounds like falsely added bassthe cord has a massive on/off switch on it (its like the size of a small cell phone!) that holds a AA battery in it.I have to jiggle the cord in the headphone jack to have the volume come out evenly to both sides of the headphones (and yes, ive used separate headphones in the jack and it works fine, so the issue is def the headphones, not the jack)After i deal with all that, the sound is ""ok"" at best.Cheap for a reason!"
5,Love it,"My husband and son are totally into their music and they go through headphones like crazy. My husband saw these and wanted them so I purchased them for him. He says they are perfect. He loves the fact that they reduce outside noises. Great buy, Great look."
4,Great headphones... but,These headphones are very comfortable for a couple hours but after that my ears start to get a little achy. They do have amazing sound quality but the sub-woofer is not as great as it is portrayed. The added bass is great but when the sub is turned up all the way it just vibrates and tickles my ears. I do definitely recommend these headphones for people shopping in this price range.
4,Ummm.,"So i paid 35 dollars for these headphones. Sounded like a bargain indeed. I listen to electronic music mostly, music with heavy Bass, mostly Dubstep and electro. I am also a video editor and a movie buff. So i use the headphones for work as well. When it comes to sound equipment theres always brats who would refuse to buy anything short of Sony or Bose etc All i can say is, if your looking at these headphone your probably not some hi-tech sound engineer. But honestly these are really awesome. So comfertable. Ive worked with 250 dollar headphones on and they have literally cut off blood supply to my ears, and i have a normal sized head with normal sized ears. These are amazing, in terms of bang for your buck and generally. The Bass is amazing for headphones, off course the sound quality i would give it a 3.5 - 4 / 5. Still really good."
3,not for audiophiles,"not what i expected, kinda disappointed really. fashion statement, yes. high quality bass boosted tunes infused into my brain, not really. i'd rather have the money back at get a few pairs of ink'd buds which offer much better sound quality at 1/3 the price."
3,Good at first,"When I got these headphones I was really surprised how good quality of music they played. After two months of using the bass makes weird annoying noise. So, I'd never buy these again."
3,Great sound but poorly made.,"I ordered a pair of theses just recently. After they arrived, within the first week, there was a short at the jack. So the bass frequencies constantly cut in and out. I have contacted Skullcandy through the warranty page online shortly after it started messing up. It's been about 3 to 4 weeks now and have not yet been helped. The sound quality is well worth what I payed for online, but definitely not worth them becoming useless within the first week of owning them."
4,pinstripe design,"Great Comfort was brought down by the bass boost module in the audio cord. When the module slides off of a surface it falls and pulls on the headphones briefly. My units quit producing sound from the right side 4 weeks after getting them. Skullcandy has a great warranty so not terribly upset but I am inconvenienced.I am receiving a new pair from Skullcandy, so I take the malfunction as an anomaly. The bass boost is truly a boost, also note that it is not just butting to boost but you can moderate the level of boost."
5,i like em,"I like them a lot, extremely good for the price!! Glad I didn't buy those overly pricedBeats by Dre headphones. Same quality for a lesser price!"
1,"**WARNING** DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, THEY WILL BREAK!!","In the past I said these headphones are great. I was very very veeeeeery wrong.They sound great until they break a month into use. Apparently they are NOT designed to handle the great sound they produce. After a few weeks the bass cut out.I called them for a refund, which I could not get because I got it through amazon, so they sent me another pair. THESE BROKE TOO. I look at their website for warranty stuff and turns out the 3rd time they fix it they wont give you a new pair so I just took the money and bought their Heavy Medal Ear Buds.Those have been working fine, but again DO NOT BUY SKULL CRUSHERS!!!"
4,"Cool, but fragile","I have purchased two set of these headphones, one for each of my kids. They really like the fit, doesn't pinch the ears, and sounds really great. They have both mentioned, don't buy these for people who are rough with there toys. They are lightweight and so comfy, but need tlc for care instructions. The more mature the child, the better they will last. Both of my kids wear their set a lot, and we haven't had any trouble."
3,Bad sound quality.,"These headphones are awesome if you are a bass lover, though turn the bass off and all you'll hear is the sub-par sound quality. I've owned a pair of in ear skullcandy for 3 years until it stopped working, I bought these as an upgrade but was deeply disappointed."
4,A unique work - A soundtrack for a book.,"To start with, this album and the books it are associated with have NOTHING to do with Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard may have marred his reputation as a truly great sci-fi author with his later 'wierdness'', however, let me assure you that this album or the associated books aren't similarly affected.This album is the soundtrack to the bestselling Mission Earth series, not the hopeless Battlefield Earth book, (the one starring Travolta).Whatever you think of Hubbard's beliefs and other 'strangeness', don't let that marr your opinion of this sterling album and the superbly funny and very clever books on which it is based.Please have an open mind about Hubbard's fiction and the other derivative works."
4,Men's H-D Pecos Boots,"I read all the reviews before purchasing. Several made it clear that these boots were a bit on the large size so I ordered a full size smaller than my normal size. When I received them they were still too large. Volt 99 customer service said I'd have to pay a $20 re-stocking fee in order to exchange them for a smaller size. I call CS and explained that there was nothing more I could have done to avoid having to exchange the boots, they waived the fee, I returned the boots for a smaller size and received them without a hitch very quickly.I am very pleased with the boots now as they are very comfortable, solidly made, good looking yet rugged. Great for riding my motorcycle. The only draw back is the fact that the size is quite a bit larger than anyone would expect making it hard to get it right the first time. Once they're right...They're Great!"
4,Fun Awesome and have a great time,"My fiance and I paid for this toy we got it home and opened it and since it hasnt been put down , when it has it goes on our little shrin of star wars and it looks Just awesome. The fireing Range is great , it fires between 2-3 feet directly up in the air every time ! TWO thumbs up"
5,I love this DVD!,"I bought this DVD a few months back, and I love watching it every opportunity that I get! My favorite part is the concert shot in Italy in 1980, along with the Uncle Floyd segments. I love the part where they perform ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" even if they are lipsynching, and I also loved the clip from ""Rock'n'Roll High School,"" when they play ""Do You Wanna Dance.""The backstage footage is interesting, although a lot of it consists of inside jokes that only the band understands.Now that three of the four original Ramones are gone, I'd highly recommend getting this DVD, so you can see the magic over and over again."
2,Get out your magnifier!,"This book is for the serious collector of vintage valentines. I bought the book wanting to look at beautiful victorian images of love, cupids, children etc., but was extremely disappointed when the cards were too small to view comfortably. If you are a collector and want to know dates and monetary value of antique Valentine Day cards, this is the book for you. There are hundreds of cards. I wanted something altogether different. Just wanted to clarify what you should expect if you purchase this book."
1,Yet another Eminem track for the pre-teen crowd (1.5 Stars),"Seriously, when is Eminem going to actually use his rap talents rather than waste them on songs geared at making elementary school kids laugh? Aside from a memorable hook, (sort of) Ass Like That is just another marginally-clever but generic Eminem single reminiscent of Just Lose It, Without Me, The Real Slim Shady, etc. etc. Ass Like That also happens to be the least amusing, proving that Eminem's ""funny"" singles are becoming less and less welcome, a trend that started with Just Lose It."
1,em must have popped some x pills while doing this,bring back cRAZY AZZ SLIM SHADY come on man you're losing us here. booty songs are not em's style at least he could have it interesting drugs is killing his career.
1,Very Bad Product,"DOA. Could not sync. Tried everything in the manual.Then searched on the web, it seems this happens often.Buyer beware."
4,I Really Like This One,"""Bark Like a Dog"" didn't do it for me; well written and produced, it seemed to be missing something. Basically, it was a last-gasp 'classic line-up' Weasel record that didn't sound 'classic'. They'd stopped touring and somehow that detracted from the whole thing too. Well here they are a couple years later with a fast(really fast)drummer and a second axe slinger, with Ben singing and sounding like he's got the fire back in his belly. Biting, somewhat bitter social commentary type vocals. You're not going to find a ""Veronica hates Me"" here, but this is deifinitely Screeching Weasel. Think one of Ben's MRR columns set to fast, extremely tight punk music. The following long player ""Television City Dream"" is more of the same."
2,Not the worst book I've read this year,"I was looking for something light-hearted and this book lived up to that expectation. It gets off to a slow start though and the characters are not so interesting and pretty shallow. There are several bad puns and references to recent popculture weaved through the predictable storyline. I'm a little over half way through and having trouble picking it up -- that never happens. If you think a farmer naming his cows Britney and Jennifer after Spears and Lopez is sweet, you might enjoy it more. I just finished the Corrections before this. It was not lighthearted but it was funny and engaging. This book reminds me of the disappointing 8 O'Clock Tuesday (or something similar and not memorable) that my book club read last summer. It is a ""sweet"" book though and some may enjoy it for that alone."
2,Quickly going nowhere...,"I have to agree with those who said that the first two-thirds of the book are much better than the last third. That said, the first two-thirds aren't that great either.I liked how the story switches between the two main characters, but by the end, the author obviously got lazy/tired/anxious and made Samantha cliched and completely stopped telling her story. And the boyfriend kind of dropped off the face of the planet. And the farmer? She's in love with him for 200 pages but then the rock star is introduced and in one paragraph the farmer meets and falls in love with some lady who saw his singles ad? Puh-leeeeeze.This book was written by someone with no sense of pacing, no creativity, and thank GOD it cost me, what, $4.00 or so? I feel ashamed having such a crappy book on my bookshelf."
2,"entertaining, but disappointingly lightweight","""Farm Fatale"" starts off as a Bridget-Jones-style modern Brit comedy, but by the end I felt like I'd been reading an updated Harlequin romance. Holden does put unexpected plot twists into her book, but many of the characters who start out interestingly dwindle into stereotypes, and I was very disappointed by her unbelievable ending. The story includes mildly graphic but hurried sex scenes that are not particularly well-written. (Holden's mention of the ""hungry throb"" her character Rosie feels in a certain part of her anatomy irritated me for weeks.) This book might amuse you on a plane, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
4,Fun Summer Read for Young Ladies,This is a fun read! I read it almost as soon as it came out and I had finished within a few days. Keep in mind that this is a fun read for someone who doesn't want to think. That is not an insult either! I have a very demanding academic workload and sometimes I need to kickback and drift to la-la land. There are some racy scenes that get your blood pumping. This is one of my favorites by Holden.
2,Read the signs - one track album,"I heard the excellent Tom Lord-Alge remix of 'Waiting' on the Six Feet Under soundtrack. I was immediately keen to hear more. However, the fact that the album is called 'Waiting', and that the sleeve notes contained the lyrics for that song only says a lot. It would seem that they are banking on that one song selling the album. Unfortunately, even the version of 'Waiting' on the album is not as good as that on the SFU soundtrack.Increasing the bass can thicken the album a little, as I have done on all but the first listen, but it is mosly bland forgettable pop. Lord-Alge produces some of the other album tracks (not the version of 'Waiting') but all of them seem to need a kick to be at all memorable. Some of the songs aren't bad but they fade into a mire of similar, forgettable fare - especially when held up against the near incandescent version of Waiting that led me to them. This album has gathered dust since the first few listens. Disappointing."
2,not that good,The dvd case was broken so the movie was just floating around and now it has scratches in it. So much for being new.
5,Blast from the Past,"I gave it this rating because it was delivered quickly, it is in great condition and I would recommend any baby boomers to get this item."
3,Classic Holiday,You must have patience and relax into the colors of this Laurel & Hardy movie based in Toyland and the March of the Wooden Soldiers.
1,March of the Wooden Solders,"Unfortunately the video is not as clear as when it comes on TV during the holidays. I was hoping it would be clearer than when it is shown on the local channels as it is a Blue ray DVD. It does have the option to be viewed in either black and white or color, but both are not up to standard. Very disappointing, Very bad copy of original."
1,Original please!,"The pleasure of new formats like DVD is to provide the original, remastered versions of classic films. This film was originally ""Babes in Toyland"", and featured more music and longer scenes. American Movie Classics aired the original in BLACK AND WHITE, and it was a great experience. Release this classic in it's original cut and in BLACK AND WHITE, clear and crisp, the way it originally was. Do they colorize the beginning and the end of the ""Wizard of OZ""?"
2,There is a NEW and much BETTER version available!,"There is a brand new version of March of the Wooden Soldiers just released for Christmas 2006. It is from Legend Films and Genius Products and it looks SPECTACULAR. They have a gorgeous black-and-white version, a stunning new color version (done with a fancy new technology), and tons of really fun bonus material. I viewed the Legend version (in the red box) alongside the Goodtimes version, and the Legend version is many times better in quality in both b/w and color. Well worth the extra few dollars and a must buy for Christmas or any other time of the year."
5,March of the Wooden Soldiers,"Excellent.All versions included, plus many fabulous extras.A 'must have' for your Holiday Movie collection."
5,Fantastic,Love this movie grew up watching it I can't believe it was on dvd they used to play it every year around Thanksgiving but I haven't seen it on T.V. in years so when I saw it had to have it I got the movie relatively quick so kudos to the seller
2,Why do they persist in ruining classics in color,"This film is perhaps an all time classic, i have watched this film endlessly over the years. My only complaint with this version is that it is in colour. This film despite it's fantasical elements is actually in black and white. What a dissapointment."
3,"Inferior DVD presentation, there are better copies out there.","Skip this version, there is a better RESTORED version that offers the film in both B&W; & Colorized versions:March of the Wooden SoldiersSee the excellent reviews about that restoration."
5,A great Holiday Movie Classic,"I remember this movie on TV every Thanksgiving when I was a kid. For some reason they stopped showing it in the mid 80's - to early 90's it has become a forgotten classic. Though I am not a fan of colorization for old B/W movies, I really like this version. It is very well done the colors do not look fake and bring out the details of the film which one could not always see in B and W. This movie color or Black and White is a true wonder to see. It is a gift from the not so distant past. The back drops and props bring in memories of the grand old amusement parks like Coney Island, or roadside America and The late Great Danbury Fair in CT. Full of fantasy and bewitching fun. Laurel and Hardy bring a magic to this film that should be seen by all. Buy it it is great for the kids and for the whole family"
5,Works really well!,"I am a skeptic. I have been taking enzymes and probiotics for a long time and believe they add positive value for my digestion. I've taken many different products ranging from cheap to quite expensive. I was pleasantly surprised when I started taking the papaya plus enzymes. It is a simple product that tastes good (I like peppermint), is not expensive, and definitely helps with digestion...no more indigestion and bowel movements have improved, too! Highly recommend. (Just wish amazon was better at showing the ingredients of supplements.)"
1,I hated the adulterous heroine!,"This book was not a romance IMHO. I wish the hero would have just kicked the heroine to the curb and found someone that was at least faithful to him. If I don't like the protagonists in a story and I'm expecting a romance, then for me the book did not do it's job. Jo Beverley is a good writer but I find her stories can be quite dark."
4,Very Sweet Dreams,Every so often a cd actually meets my expectations. I find this work more beneficial for us than for our new daughter.
5,WOW!!,This is an incredible book. A must read for every entrepreneur. This is Marilyn Ross at her best!! I could not put it down. Tons of resources. A BEST BUY. Where were you Marilyn when I started my own business 20 years ago?
3,Good...outdated,"There seems to be alot of debate on if this book is fact or fiction. FICTION.It is set in 90's Japan and tries to give a sence of different aspects of the country, but if you are looking for a view of modern Japan I wouldn't look here. Japan has changed alot since the book was written.The stories are for the most part very entertaining, and the book is great light reading.Book consists of short stories about different kinds of folk in Japan you don't see on the news."
3,"Ok watch, hard to set time","Watch and band are ok. The band strap o-ring (holds extra band) has elastic which stretches too easily.The set up is a nightmare. It is impossible to remember hot to change time.Illumination is OK, but button hard to find in the dark.Watch is great for keeping time.No other features of the watch I can use, because I do not want to take time to figure them out. It is not intuitive."
4,casio watch,"watch is nice looking, practical, and much better quality than comparably priced watches found in stores. like the 10 year battery feature."
5,Nice watch,"This watch has all the essentials, it looks good, 10 yr battery is cool and can't beat the price. Highly recommend it."
4,Casio watch,"This is a good watch for people who still use them. I did find that setting the analog hands is a little complicated. Who knew that setting the hands of watch would become harder than setting the digital time? In order to ""fall back"" from DST, you have to push one button six times, then two at once, then another to stop the hands before you get to the correct time, then another to advance them twenty seconds at a time. I can only foresee this being a problem once a year, (""springing forward"" will be the same operation, just not so time consuming), unless changing time zones frequently."
4,Nice watch for the money,"I needed an inexpensive sport watch that I could wear for working / playing outdoors. I think this one will fit the bill just fine. I like the color, the face and the fabric band. I don't love the velcro strip all the way down the one side. I'm sure it's good for making the band adjustable for many wrist sizes but it covers the band too far for my taste and I'm concerned it will collect dirt and grime. Other than that the watch was fairly easy to set and the light works well so I can see the time in the dark. Well worth the price."
2,Plastic casing breaks,"I purchased this watch in September of 2009. Nine months later the plastic casing broke, making the velcro strap lose its point of connection. I'm not engaged in the kind of activity that it tough on a watch, so the breakage appears to me to be a problem with the material used in its construction."
5,Funky,"Wear it all the time. Accuracy is adequate. But its appearance is just too funky. However, the band is a little fragile."
2,"It's good, but...","A few tracks are missing. While you do get the 1989 remix of the Time Warp and even Superheroes, you don't get Sword of Damocles, Planet Schmanet Janet (Wise Up, Janet Weiss), or Once in a While.Just hold out for the 25th Anniversary soundtrack. It's more complete."
4,Off the wall fun,This movie is a classic and love by most people that I've come in contact with. It was great to be able to find the orginal soundtrack with the orginal cast. To be able to sing along in car with the CD is great.Loved it!!
2,Good price...Not so good smell.,"Since ""Realities"", had good reviews, and a low price, I gave it a try.The wife said it smells like bug spray. I can't trust the Amazon reviews.I was just trying to save money; but I'll have to go back to ""Pleasures by Estee Lauder"".The price is much higher, but it smells very good and doesn't hang in the air for five hours.You get what you pay for."
1,Worst I have ever bought.,"I bought this along with Victoria's Secret Very Sexy For Him2, and Locoste (not sure of the name, the bottle is clear, the liquid is green, and of course there's a lizard on the side). The latter two smell wonderful and I get a lot of good comments, but this crap smells like alcohol and i wouldn't even put it on my dogs. I might as well put it in the trash.... on that note i think i will."
2,hohum,"This movie is something you may have found 10 years ago late at night on the old USA channel, or maybe even the sci-fi channel. It reminded me of the old cheesy roger corman movies. Your left with an ok (over done) plot, you have some ok actors, mixed in with some bad actors. You have some nice computer generated FX, mixed with some cheesy Halloween alien costumes. As a matter of fact I thought the aliens in the movie looked like a complete rip off of the aliens in the movie ""Enemy Mine"" made back in 1985. This movie was very so/so. I would pass on it. You might be able to see it for free on tv because it has a made for tv feel to it"

3,There's Not Much Here!,"I have just received this. I ordered it because I will be teaching Senior High School English in a new District this year, and will be responsible for the Research Paper. Three factors attracted me to this source -- The pages were standard 8 1/2 by 11, so they could be easily copied; the copyright was 2004, which was much more updated than most sources I was finding; and the price was right. But when I received it, I was disappointed. There is very little ""helpful information"" here and it is really only a sample of organizational sheets that students can use in taking notes. The calendar (see sample in ""Search This Book"" is just a basic 7-day page with days and squares. These can be printed out FREE on-line. Most of the pages within this collection are just as basic. As a teacher, I can't do much with this. Sorry."
1,"Utterly useless, the wood bows and the shelves fall.","I don't need to say more than that. The side wood is not straight, it bows outward and the pegs are too short, so the shelves literally fall off the pegs and your DVDs go crashing to the floor. This thing is terrible and a waste of money, don't buy it."
1,cheaply made,"This product has already fallen apart, and all I have in it is DVD's. I would not recommened this product to anyone, since it is junk."
1,no good,"this product is not worth the money, the shelves do not stay in b/c the sides are too far apart and you cant tighten it b/c its a cardboard back and is awful"
1,quality not good,"The day after I ordered this I was shopping at Meijer and found a similar, but narrower unit for $20. I put it together and was going to refuse this item when it came. Unfortunately, it didn't work where I wanted it, so I kept this piece when it arrived. The quality of the $20 unit I bought was much better than this! The finish is nice on it, but that's about the only good thing I have to say. The shelves don't sit evenly- the unit side walls feel unstable- the directions are awful and it is awkward to assemble. I've put together a lot of this type of thing, the latest project being a captain's bed, so I am comfortable with assembling these types of items. Definitely not worth the price."
5,very cute,"pros: very cute and useful and does not take a lot of space, has a lot of shelves to put a lot of things on it, easy to assemble, high quality...cons: don't be fooled by the pictures, they make the self look bigger than it really is, read the dimensions and that will tell you the real size."
1,Don't Buy. Look for a better one.,"A Dust collector, for some reason dust loves this item. Veryflimsy and unreliable. I wish I looked harder for a betterbookshelf."
2,Lasted for a few years,"This was a decent item i remember buying from a target/walmart type store. super excited to get a volume to price ratio that was good for me. While yes it did work for awhile it did eventually bow and i mean every piece of press board bowed. i kinda put it in a closet and forgot about it over this last year and when I checked on it all the shelves had fallen down onto the tops of the dvds below. this happen on each level. I think it lasted for about 3 to 4 years but now it pretty useless, unless some one knows how to warp press wood. the problem with the design is that it just doesn't have enough support, the walls are thin and the pegs are short."
3,Kids love it,"My kids found this at our library and love the old baseball songs so we had to buy it. They especially like the Abbott and Costello ""Who's on First?"" routine and the Dodger song by Danny Kaye."
2,Only slightly better than none at all,"This sheet makes the Cool Bed look slightly more like a typical dog bed but the quality of the fabric minimizes the improvement. The fabric appears to be a low quality, very low thread count synthetic fiber weave. Perhaps the sheet needs to be this way so as not to impede its heat transfer effect, but $20 is way too much for what you get here."
3,K&H Cool Bed 3,"It is a good cover when it is new but the first time you wash it, it shrinks and pulls the mattress in a bit."
3,"Cool Bed, but my dog wouldn't stay on it","I purchased this cool bed for my aging, arthritic labrador. It is hot here in Texas and I thought this would be perfect for his aching joints, and the bed seemed wonderful to me. My dog did get on it one time, and took a nap. When he was ready to get up he had a hard time getting off of it. He would not get back on it. I put it in his usual napping place, but he wanted nothing to do with it.I gave it to my daughter, and her younger dogs (pugs) love it."
3,textual criticism,"Wachtel is co-author w/Kurt Aland on another book, that puts him in good company! This book is in the field of textual criticimEric"
3,Still clunky.,Still a clunky interface compared to TurboTax. Had to get both this year as TurboTax didn't have one of the forms I needed. In TaxCut Home & Business you actually have to install 2 programs from 2 CDs. They almost seem like they're written by 2 different companies and the Businss one seems to be buggier. All I get is the welcome screen and thne the program disappears. Have had to reinstall several times.
1,Dead on Arrival,"After building a bunch of PCs I got lazy and decided to buy one for the parents. But unit arrived dead as a rock. Power on light turned on when you hit the on button, but no startup. No fan movement. No monitor signal. NOTHING.Had to return unit."
3,WARNING FOR SIZE,"Hello, Okay so I liked the product very much. I have to send it back because it was way too large. I am a short guy 5'5, weigh about 155lbs and have a small frame. I put this pack on me and I looked silly. It looked like an extra body part hanging off my back. Not cool. If i were a taller person I think it would suite best. Next time I am going to be more mindful about the size. Just wanted to give everyone the heads up. Aside from that. I wish It fit me. =("
1,Lousy customer service,"I order this magazine in March. Received the first issue towards the end of May, 2 weeks after promised. Received one more issue, then nothing. The distributor said they were pulling Madame Figaro from Amazon because of distribution issues and cancelled my order.Amazon was going to cancel my subscription to Elle in error. I see that Madame Figaro is still offered online, in spite of distributor claims.I give it NO Stars, but to publish the review you are forced to put in at least one!!!!"
3,this book makes you feel corrine's frustration,"When I first began reading this book, I thought that the heroine was a snob and deserved everything she got. By the end of the book, I wanted to castrate her husband. Definately a must for spurned lovers!"
1,NOT ROMANCE!,"THIS BOOK WAS SO FULL OF HATRED THAT I JUST WISH I THREW IT OUT SOONER. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY SHALLOW AND JUST TOO HARD TO COMPREHEND. I CAN'T REALLY TELL IF THEY ARE IN LOVE OR NOT.THE FACT THAT THE HERO ABUSE THE HEROINE IS JUST TOO MUCH. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT "" TAKING A HAND TO YOUR BACKSIDE"" BUT ""A FULL HAND TO YOUR FACE AND KNOCKING YOU TO THE TABLE!"" HE DIDN'T EVEN STOP AT THAT. HE WOULD HAVE HIT HER AGAIN IF SHE HADN'T BEG HIM TO STOP. I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF SELF-CONTROL IS THAT? THE MAN IS A MONSTER.I DON'T FEEL VERY CERTAIN ABOUT THEIR FUTURE. IF A HERO CAN ABUSE HER NOW IT JUST MEANS HE CAN'T CONTROL HIMSELF. HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.VERY DISSAPOINTING..."
1,No Japanese track,I find the lack of the orignal language track to be quite disrespectful to the original.
1,Styrofoam,doesn't taste like ranch at all or good and is pretty much like chewing styrofoam! doesn't have a cheese flavor either! same for the jalapeno.. have yet to try the white cheddar or nacho cheese flavors i also bought but i am sure they will suck as well. i will stick to my pork rinds because they are low carb and taste good!!!!!!!
2,Won't buy again,Like other reviewers I found these to be way to salty. They do not need to add extra salt when cheese already has enough on it's own. If they change the recipe I will be more than happy to try again but not the way they are now.
1,Not a fan,"If you like burnt cheese this is the snack for you. I'm not a fan, but im sure someone likes them."
3,Merely okay,"Some people really get into the Just the Cheese snacks, but I think they're just okay. They *are* crispy and salty, but there's something odd about the texture. Like a flattened dried chunk of styrofoam. And they don't taste particularly good, either. There's no real jalapeno flavor, nor do they taste like cheese. Sort of a nondescript crunchy thing. But if you're low-carbing it and jonesing for a crunchy snack to munch on, they're better than diving into a bag of Fritos. I like the popped cheese better - probably because those are much saltier and crunchier, so they satisfy me with just a couple of bites. However Just the Cheese, like the popped cheese, can be turned into croutons or floated in soup to give it some texture.It's kind of the snack equivalent of Totino's pizza - crap food that sometimes just hits the spot."
5,Loves them,"Our son has celiacs and had to give up his beloved cheez its these snacks taste just like them, he was thrilled and couldnt get enough. They are a bit salty (just to warn you, but they are good)"
2,"Too, too salty","I love the idea and was so excited to try these little nibbles that I dismissed the reviews that said they were too salty. I purchased the Wisconsin Cheddar, and I couldn't even eat all of one of the little bags, it was such an OD of sodium that I literally made a pucker face. I'm not shy about salt, but these are pretty much unpalatable...and I have 15 more packs! Maybe the other flavors don't taste as salty, but buyer beware."
3,Take getting used to.,I bought these (for a lot more money) in the health food store. They are a bit strange but if you are on a strict diet and desparate for something crunchy they grow on you. They are quite strong and salty and I would not eat them every day but at least it is a snack I can have on my low glycemic diet.
2,will not re-order,"I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state."
1,extremly salty,I was expecting cheese as it states. I can't even tell you how salty these cheese crisps are. I brought them in to my job has three different people try them and I couldn't give then away. Every person I had try said they were gross.... Please re think this product.
4,"Perfect for low-carb dieting, super salty.","Sometimes you want some goldfish crackers, but you don't want to cheat on your diet. These are good for those moments. They are really really salty, but it fulfills that craving. Tastes like baked cheese--which is exactly what it is."
2,Too Salty,"I saw these made on the TV show ""Unwrapped"", and they sounded like something I'd enjoy. Wrong. These cheese isn't sharp enough and they add way too much salt - it's all I can taste."
4,Pretty good but very little for the price.,"These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts. A lot of the space in each bag is air. I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.Flavorwise, they're alright. Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of. They're not amazing though. You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time. This is very light flavored."
4,"Inspiring, but the detours were heavy-handed","A great short read about the live recording sessions that led to the creation of one of the seminal R&B albums. The writing is punchy, respectful, and never overwrought -- except for the glaring and jarring detours into the Cuban missile crisis. The episode is clearly relevant to the story, because the concert in question took place in roughly the same 24-hour time span that the crisis was unfolding, but while everyone in the Apollo that night may have had the crisis on their minds, the digressions into what the fighter planes and the decision makers were doing at exactly the same time that James Brown was wiping sweat off his brow as he switched gears and tore into another song are distracting and ultimately tell us little about why the crisis made the night charged. Wolk should have stuck to the performances and the music or else found a better way of weaving the crisis into the book."
3,More Fun to Just Listen to the Music!,"I like good music writing -- it can be as lyrical and inspiring as the music it is about, albeit in another art form -- but sometimes, some music defies the written word -- Volk has worked hard here and brings us lots of facts -- but James Brown on this record in particular defies the written word -- all you can say is that some yowling and howling is so other-worldly that you gotta hear it to get it -- thanks for this valiant attempt -- but I think that after all is said and done, maybe words are not much help when it comes to this particular transcendent experience...."
4,Great product for the price,"The quality doesn't feel as nice as the other brand I bought at my local drug store and feels a little harsher on the skin when brand new, but they last a long time and come at a great price so I will continue to buy."
2,not worth the money,"Get a more language specific set of CD's. This is rather boring, it teaches basically 85 words and phrases in each language. They have characters say the words for you, but pronunciation is hard to mimic because they did not actually video tape the people saying the words. They video taped them in English, and then dub the sound over. You cannot tell where your lips are supposed to be, where your tongue should be or anything helpful for correct pronunciation. You do not learn how to order anything or conduct business. You learn ""Where is the bank?"" and ""Where are the suitcases?"" From there you could probably substitute other vocabulary words, but there are no activities in which you are asked to do so. There are no sentence formation activities. The only thing this is good for is a tiny collection of vocabulary with generic pronunciation instruction. If you have never heard a language before, it gives you something at least."
2,"Good for price, but very limited","This is a good program if you are going to a foreign country and would like to know a few words. But, each language is very limited. There is words like Thank you, you're welcome, yes, no, etc. I would reccomend this program for people who like to explore new languages, like me. But don't plan on learning a new language with this program. I suggest getting a book or a program that teaches just the language you would like to learn. But, not a bad price for just $20."
5,NO HAY QUE TOMAR AL BUDISMO,"COMO UNA RELIGIÓN, SINO COMO ¡UNA FILOSOFÍA DE VIDA !Comprenderloe s sencillo hasta para un niño, ya que en este libro se expone copmo historias con una lección...Nos enseñan a vivir SIN CODICIA, SIN ENVIDIAS, CON AMOR Y SERENIDAD !Puedo uno leer las historias mil veces, y cada una de ellas, obtener beneficios nuevos!Si eres desdichado, no dejes de leerlo.Y si ERES FELIZ Y QUIERES SER AÚN MÁS FELIZ...TÓMALO COMO A UN COMPAÑERO DE TU VIDA !"
2,Sin Eater not as good as expected,"The Sin Eater, has a good story line, is a little intense for family viewing of all ages. However I felt the film never really came togather and the plot a little thin."
2,Only for fans of sentimental evangelical movies,"Cadi is a young girl of Welch descent, living with her people in the ""wicked mountains"" where people believe in various pagan myths, such as ""The Sin Eater"". Cadi thinks she caused the death of her sister and needs the sin eater to eat her sins. She then meets a travelling preacher who tells her about Jesus.For such a bad story, the movie certainly goes on for far too long, at almost two boring hours and the acting doesn't make it any better. Liana Liberato (Cadi) is one of the few actors in the movie who do a decent job. The rest range from awkward to awful. Not even the great Louise Fletcher gives a good performance. The accent all sound fake; Henry Thomas is especially painful to hear.There is one scene towards the end that makes me give the movie a weak 2 star rating instead of one. Recommended only for fans of sentimental evangelical movies. Others should stay away."
2,service,"II bought the product twice but unfortunately is very weak, not shockproof. actually very good price but not recominedo for hard work."
3,ECONOMICO,"VARIEDAD DE MODELOS , BIEN ESPECIFICADO, ECONOMICO Y RAPIDO DE ENCONTRAR, LA RESPUESTA INMEDIIATA, EL ENVIO RAPIDO ME GUSTO ."
4,Good little watch for a teenager that looses them!,"Purchased this watch for my son as his previous one was falling to pieces. It is a very nice looking watch and one cannot go wrong for that price. It looks a lot more expensive then it is, which is great because I never know when my son will forget it somewhere! It's light and seems well built and sturdy, another important criteria for the teenage years!!!"
2,Stiff band,The watch's band is so stiff that it keeps sliding around to the side of my wrist and I have to struggle to get the watch face back so I can read it. If I tighten the band so it won't twist it is too uncomfortable. The watch itself is attractive but I was unable to set the small hands because I couldn't feel the double click on the winder stem as described in the instructions. All in all I just gave up and after a few days went back to my trusty Timex.
1,Ripoff,"This is a fine watch except for the band. I've had mine for about a year. The cheap resin band is cracked where it passes through the buckle and is about break at the slightest strain. I went to Wal-Mart (where I bought it) to buy a band. None of the available bands would work due to the odd configuration of the watch body. I called Casio and learned that their proprietary bands are not available in retail stores and that I would have to order it from Casio - almost 22 dollars, including shipping. I'm left to wonder if this is a deliberate ripoff strategy or poor product design."
4,"Good price, nice watch","I've had this watch for about a month and wear it daily to work. For the price point I feel it's well made. All hands function as they should. Time and day of the week are easy to read, but the smaller date hand can be hard to read at a glance. The band is comfortable to wear during long hours at work and it does not retain water as many link bands tend to do if you have to wash your hands frequently. The stainless steel case is attractive; a nice size for a man's watch--too soon to comment on durability but for around $30 you can't go wrong.Follow up:This watch served well while it lasted. After approx 2.5 years the band has broken. The watch still works fine but at this price point it's futile to pay $20 for a band and then likely a battery in the near future. I am going to try my luck with the Timex Men's T49772 Casual Diver Watch as a work watch in the clinical setting."
2,Nothing compared to my live experience,"I remember seeing MSL live in Chicago one time, totally random chance meeting. I was captivated at their live show! Fantastic stage presence combined with mesmorizing instrumentation and melodies. However, this is about 5 years later now, and I ran across this CD in the bargain bin. Excited to listen and recall that enjoyable evening experience, I was let down quickly. It's just so boring. Having listened to much more interesting stuff like Theatre of Tragedy, Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, and even Left Hand Solution, this doesn't even come close. There are moments of delight scattered throughout, but too far and in between to bother. I tried to like it, but am dissappointed to conclude otherwise."
5,I love Ramona!,"Beverly Cleary and her Ramona books helped me to love reading. Even as an adult *I'm 20*, I've bought the series because of the good memories I have reading them. A must for anyone with elementary aged children, this along with the ""Little House"" series will teach them the joys of reading."
5,Very Funny,It was great to sit with the kids and enjoy the cartoons from when I was a child. The cd is a great combonation.
1,Probably the worst Sparks album ever,"I'm an unashamed Sparks fan but in this album they sound like a sad shaddow of their normal original selves. The songs feel thin in production and the electronic edge lacks the sort of originality that one sensed in ""No One Song In Heaven"" (which I never really liked but could appreciate for those who like that sort of synth-rock)It feels like they were trying to get back a bit of their 1970s sound but without giving up the euro-pop feel. And the result falls between two stools and simply doesn't really work.It's only an album to buy for completeness if you're a diehard fan and feel so inclined."
4,Great Harmony,"This CD came through Amazon. This is a trip back in time, as the Chordettes stopped recording, I think, in the early sixties. Having said that, by the end of the CD it's enough. I'm guessing that some of the masters could have seen better days also. But it's worth the price."
5,listen the chordettes...it's a grrrs band...,"chordettes sound like me the music of mike myers's halloween, their sound is a element of the past and the ambiance is unique."
5,It Actually Works!,This is the first Rubics Cube book that I actually understood easily! Well written and some what simple to follow.
4,A Bumper Collection,"Never mind what the other reviews say,some episodes on this DVD don't feature any snow because it's that it's supposed to be a collection of 7 seasonal episodes. The episodes on this disc are...1.)Mice Follies(This episode doesn't exactly take place in winter but it does feature ice skating.)2.)Desings On Jerry3.)The Tom And Jerry Cartoon Kit(My favorite cartoon by William L. Snyder because usually the rest of his cartoons are bad.)4.)Snowbody Loves Me(Oh,yeah...the DVD continues with my favorite producer,Chuck Jones!)5.)I'm Just Wild About Jerry6.)The A-Tom-Inable Snowman7.)Advance And Be MechinizedBut if you like Mice Follies but don't want it on this DVD,then buy Tom And Jerry's Greatest Chases(another DVD including the same episode.) But if you love Chuck Joones and your favorite Tom And Jerry cartoon from the Gene Deitch years is ""The Tom And Jerry Cartoon Kit"",than than this the disc just for you. So good-luck."
1,Picture is not what you get!,"Okay so i was searching for a new Wireless N adapter and searched very specifically on Amazon for that and wound up buying this, lo and behold i should have looked closer because Amazon had this under wireless n adapters and it is a g adapter. Yet the picture is the exact same model i recieved except that is says G not N on the adapter and box, the information and the picture are not the same do not be fooled!"
4,Overall Satisfied.,"For the price the balls are perfect. I am an instructor and I use them in my classes. They seem to not hold air very long, after one class they need to be blown up again. But overall I am satisfied."
5,Very Sturdy!,"I love the ball for Bender Ball type exercises of course, and I keep the inflate straw in my jewelry box to keep away from my grandson. But he has found and beat the heck out of this ball a few times, and the material just keeps holding up. Such a reasonable price for a high quality product is a rare treat!"
2,Sticky ball,"I had hoped to love using this ball. When I took it out of the wrapper, the plastic is so sticky that it is going to pick up lint and pet hair instantly. I am very disappointed."
4,"Rehash of Familiar Material, But Still a Good Read","Piper's book focuses on the call to pastors to see the ministry as a calling instead of a business. While I have read similar material in other books, Piper's book is still a good read.Among the topics he covers include:1. Do not put your trust in man. Fear God instead.2. We are dependent on God - our job is to wait for Him and let Him work mighty things through us as He chooses.3. We cannot produce fruit apart from God. Time spent in prayer is not wasted time.4. Good thoughts on the importance of reading good books.5. The dangers of legalism.6. Our afflictions can be used to comfort others.7. Live a simple lifestyle so that others may simply live.8. Pastoral ministry is serious business.While the book's contents may be familiar to several readers, it doesn't hurt to be reminded periodically of the basics, lest we stray from the faith.All in all, a good read."
5,The Design vs. The Outcome of America,How did it come to be that we give Congress and the President approval ratings of less than 10%? Where are the checks that kept the federal government on a leash? Where the early fears of a federal machine consuming its creator valid? Are we experiencing the United Sates as designed in 1787? What were the possible turning points?I suggest you read this book. What an enlightened trip into the past. This book should be required reading for citizenship and all citizens.
3,"Didn't read it, but made it pretty","I designed the interior of this book, and did the 16 page inserts. I think Jack is great, and felt honored working on this project. I haven't read the book, though. I have too much respect for him as an actor and don't want to know what he's like offscreen."
2,Very dated and biased in approach,"I bought this for my son and wife as they have a child that is a very picky eater. However, this book seems very dated and more of a commercial for breast feeding. The male parent wasn't mentioned at all - at least in the part I read. And the information seemed very 'old school'. I did not attempt to finish."
1,Not for children who CAN'T eat,"If you need encouragement to stop forcing your child to eat, then this is the book for you. If you want encouragement to keep breastfeeding, even exclusively, for a LONG time, then this is the book for you. However, if your child CAN'T eat due to oral motor issues or sensory integration issues, then this book is NOT for you. This book does not address the gagging with ALL foods that can occur when baby has real physical problems preventing him from eating when he wants to. The book is pretty repetitive, and could be summed up in one sentence: Don't force your child to eat. It gives no help in trying to teach a child to eat when he wants to but can't."
3,warning label ( buyer beware),"this is a great looking player the picture is perfect better than the one my daughter got last year that one was half the size of this one but.....and you know there was a but this dvd player contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm. that is not hearsay either another website that also sells it has that disclaimer posted along with the product details even though my daughter loves it especially the bigger picture it is going back better safe than sorry we will stick with the old one"
1,"I love bad movies, but this one was WAY too bad to see twice","I love cult movies and this one is, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The plot seemed interesting enough: one Siamese twin commits a murder, but what will happen to them? They can't put the innocent one in jail, but can't let the guilty one go free. However, there is really no conclusion and it was so slow that i almost couldn't finish watching it."
5,Great player,"Totally compatible with my old Kenwood CD changer. Works 10 times better than my previous cassette Kenwood, even though that one worked great also. The sound is good and is great with my woofers."
2,Warning: Re-recorded versions!,"Juice Newton is famous for her country hit 'Queen Of Hearts.' The song gained popularity back in the 1970s, and was a top country single. And, it was so big that it was featured in the hit video game 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' in 2004.And, she got a her own compilation in Madacy's 'Golden Legends' series. They take 14 legendary songs from your career and put them on a CD for a low price. Sounds great, right?Wrong. These are RE-RECORDED VERSIONS AND ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS!!! This shows a lack of effort on Madacy's part. And, the sound quality is very poor.No wonder this is so cheap! Do yourself a favor and buy the originals. But avoid this one at all costs.Not recommended."
1,Poor quality,"This costume looks so good in the advertised picture, but it doesn't live up to the photo. It is of very poor quality and the hat is really not at all like the photo. In the photo, the hat looks like the brim would be stiff and the red stitches actually look like stitches. The actual hat that you get is floppy and not at all stiff and the red stitches do not even look like stitches. I ordered a size larger than my daughter normally wears and it is still almost too small. The material feels like it would rip quite easily. Overall, I would not recommend this costume. Sorry that I bought it."
5,Fantastic CD's of a Fantastic Ellington Band,"I have both this set and the more common RCA ""Blanton-Webster Band"" version of this peak Ellington band (The RCA set was issued on October 25, 1990, ASIN: B000003EO4). The Definitive Records set is much better than the RCA version.The RCA version over-uses noise reduction to the point that the sound is muffled and bland. RCA should really be ashamed. What they should do is reissue the set using the excellent remastering that was employed for their massive Centennial box set (they did this with their ""Mid-Forties"" box set, which I love).Definitive Records is located in Spain, but they easily ship to the USA or anywhere else. You can find them by plugging their name into your favorite web search engine. In this case, ""Definitive"" is the ""Definitive"" version of Ellington's Blanton-Webster years - avoid the current RCA version (which has a black cover and a sketch of Ellington). The sound is vibrant and clear - without noticeable hissing or popping."
5,Heart-warming story!,Thoroughly enjoyed the story and character development in this book - very inspiring. I felt as if I knew the characters as great friends!
4,Neal Yard apothecary shop,"This book was a gift to me, and it offers a description of ailments, and gives you a choice of appropriate remedies from homoeopathy, aromatherapy and herbalism.These remedies are suggested to bring about relief or cure from the Neal Yard apothecary shop.This is a nice little book for anyone interested in alternative medicine."
5,All 3 books were great!!!,Loved the trilogy!! I got one for free and it was a good read. I got all 3 and read them in one week!! =D
1,Deceptive Product Advert ...,"The one review on here was to down other reviews which somehow did not show up. I can only assume the seller posted that. There is not much in the details here. While it shows the blender in the image and items frequently bought together - when you get to the product detail it tells you of a blender metal shaft that fits models this or that and M5550 , the review talks about whisk attachments and voltage ratings. No where in the descriptions does it mention anything like that. I can understand people being misled to thinking this is the blender and not just the attachment for the blender. It became much more clear what was being sold - looking on the review page. If you are looking for a BLENDER - this is not the blender but an attachment for one. UNLESS you own one of the models DON'T buy this."
2,Okay but wouldn't buy it again,This software is So-So. Face it who has all day to take a history...and all day is what it would take if you try to use this. Just suck it up and go take a night class. This software was no help to me..Maybe I will buy the tapes.
5,The Family Guide to Homeopathy,"Easy to understand,concise book,that you can use when you have some health condition that you do not need immediate help."
3,"Poor Quality, Billy has better DVD's","If you are a fan of Billy Cobham, as I am, you may be disappointed with this DVD. The drums seem really low in the mix and you can see him doing a lot more than you actually hear unless you listen hard. I would have given it 4 stars for this but Michal Urbaniak and his electric saxophone ruined the performance further. He sounds so corny and smooth jazz-like=irritating. He doesn't have the groove in his playing that we get from Billy and the great Mike Stern (really young here, but an awesome performance). If you really crave a Cobham DVD as I did, go with the Culturemix Paris Concert. Get this only to complete you Cobham collection or hear young Mike Stern (his live DVD is worth checking out, too-by inakustik (they also put out Cobham's Paris concert--they always put out high quality concert videos)."
4,Another Artist from Nova Scotia,"Until I saw the movie ""Terry"", I had never heard of Stan Rogers. His song ""Turnaround"" plays three times in the disc, including the end and the gallery of pictures during the filming. Stan could have written that song for Terry Fox, although he recorded it long before the Marathon of Hope.I have always like Anne Murray, so I thought I'd take a chance, if anything to get that title song. I found the folksy flavor a treat, and a trip to Nova Scotia. Canada lost quite an artist when Stan died in a freak accident in 1983."
3,Song Excellent/Album not really my thing,"To be honest I bought this for the song Northwest Passage only. I had heard it around 12 years ago played in a bar whilst I was in Canada. Finally managed to find it and bought it from the Amazon US site which turned out to be cheaper than Amazon UK even taking account of postage to UK! Anyway, my family may have connections with John Franklin the explorer who is mentioned in the song hence the reason I bought it.I like the song Northwest Passage a lot and I'd give it 5 out 5. The other notable song is The Field Behind The Plow but to be honest, the rest of the album is a bit too Country and Western for me."
5,Excellent Book!,I've been painting and taking classes for over twenty years and found much of the information in this book to be new and most helpful.
5,one of many of my favorites,It came on time and it was exactly what I was expecting. I look foward to finding more of my favorite movies on here
1,ITEM IS NOT THE SAME AS PICTURE,"BEWARE, the Pink hat you see is not what you will get. Instead you get a deep Red hat. And it's not worth it money-wise to ship back for a return.FORGET IT!"
5,Great introduction to contemporary tribal legal struggles,"This is not a video about Africa and it does not include Peter Ustinov. Instead it is a video about three contemporary Indian tribes, and the different ways law intersects with their struggles for survival. I highly recommend it for educators teaching in the area of Indian law, studies, or policy."
2,Lazy Writing Makes This More Grueling Than an Instruction Manual,"This book is an excruciating read and, if it didn't hold information I need, I'd toss it from my book stacks with satisfaction. Holman is clearly not a gifted writer and appears to have little interest in attempting to achieve such status. What you get with SOUND for Film and Television is like a condensed instruction manual for the study, technical names and mechanics screwed together with lazy, careless language. Forget skipping through to the middle to read up on a particular microphone, the crammed description will be completely composed of references to complex information from past chapters. You will have to read it through, as arduous (and potentially impossible) as the task may be, to access any of the valuable details buried within."
5,Amazing - really lessens crepe....,"This eye cream is BY FAR the best I've ever tried. All others pale in comparison. I've used LOTS of different eye products and this one lessens lines FAR more fully than any other. The AHA in the eye cream probably does the trick. You can't get it TOO close to your eye before bed - in case you rub it, or it travels in your eye, but WOW, the results - AND I have great skin to begin with. The crepe is GONE after 4 weeks of use....I would recommend to anyone...."
5,Beautiful voice!,"This isn't going to be a very sophisticated review; nor is it necessarily objective. I loved the CD mostly because I really enjoy her voice; I find it nice and mellow and fun to listen to in the car. I heard her first on the Napster commercial and decided I had to have her CD, pure and simple. Little known artists need all the help they can get in the form of CD sales, so any type of illegal download is out of the question. I think America has to vote with their wallets in this type of situation.And yes, I do believe others will enjoy her music as well, although I understand this style is not for everyone. So, if you liked her sound-bite on the commercial, you won't be disappointed by buying the full version."
5,Best new artist in a long time!,"This is one of a VERY few new albums I've purchased recently, after hearing Love Song on the radio. All I can say is wow. This is the album Fiona Apple SHOULD have made. If she had she would probably not be floundering in obscurity right now. Great songs, great lyrics, and a good solid 4-5 singles on this album. Thank you Sara for making good music in this day and age. There aren't nearly enough of you out there!"
4,Jim's Review,Different type of music from an artist who should be getting more airplay. I'm glad I bought it.
4,Worth hearing,"I was a little hesitant buying this album...her lead single ""Lovesong"" got so much airplay and seemed to be on every advertisement for every new show that I was over it quickly...too much sometimes can be too much. But it had been a while since I'd heard the song and anything else by Sarah so I purchased this not long ago and I was pleasently surprised. What an amazing album.Her voice is strong, the lyryics are very personable (I'm sure she snuck into my brain to write Gravity).I wont compare her to Tori as no one should be...She is a one off and completely unique.Some pop influenced tracks mix in with some ballads and numerous radio friendly tunes.It's a great album to put on your ipod if you have a long trip ahead.I can't wit for Sarah's new album, I'll be buying that one the day it comes out."
4,Grows on You,"Well written, well sung. LOVED her inital single...Love Song....enjoyed her album after a few spins. But I was not immediately taken to it."
5,awesome!,"Deliver was fast and I definitely love the little voice album, I enjoy listening to this album on a rainy day."
4,Pleasant creation (a'las) ... Accoustics vocals & instruments!,I liked a number of songs on this CD. I'm happy to know that the song which first caused me to get this CD is the first track! I absolutely adore it. I expect more surprises coming from this fine and becoming artist in the future. Sara Bareilles's LITTLE VOICE CD is actually heard in a magnetically loud voice. Her songs are strong and uplifting as well as real as can be without the punching bag lyrics. I give her high accolades for this effort. Most songwriting (music) today have a lot of punching bag aura. * * * * *
4,Female Jason Mraz,Great artist... Soulful and Bright. Have a unique way of expressing her wording of emotions and situations. Between the lines is one of my fav as well as Come Round Soon. Her titles sound a lot like John Mayer titles.
2,Overrated,"I guess she's the current MTV darling. If you've never heard better I guess she's ok. Michelle Branch is much better, so is Natasha Bedingfield, and that's just listing who you'll find on MTV , which isn't saying much.The songwring is adequate..the instruments are nothing great.Her voice is nothing to write home about but she's about as good as Sheryl Crow..""Love on the Rocks"" is one tune I might play, the others rely too muchon lyrics and major label promotion.I'd like to like this album for the lyrics but her voice and the arrangements underwhelm."
2,Dead after 6 months,"After 6 months of use, I'm sadden to say that it had died. It worked okay for a while, and I felt it was acceptable. But when I heard clicking, I opened it up to see what the problem was. I found the insides had cheap wiring and other inexpensive junk. The 3 lights? Those don't mean anything.I had 2 of the 3 fans die out on me, and the last one now chips away at the plastic. There's just no durability in this cooling pad. I don't recommend it at all."
1,Not a good product,This product is not powerful enough to even begin cooling my HP laptop. The fan speed is too slow. The plastic body retains heat that reflects back onto the laptop. The reviews I have read here must have computers that don't generate as much heat as my HP. Both the top and bottom are hot to the touch. I cannot recommend it.
3,satisfactory,"well, it seemed to be working great for the first week or so, but soon after, the bottom fan gave out and started clicking and making a bunch of noise. occasionally it will stop all together and the bottom fan will make a loud buzzing noise and not move until i give it a ""bump"". it cools my laptop down without a doubt, i saw changes immediately as i plugged it in, but i don't foresee it being too long lasting."
3,Okay for short term laptop cooling,My laptop was having a big problem of overheating before it died altogether. This fan probably helped to prolong it's life for about six months. Then one of the fans stopped working and the whole thing would just get so hot from the computer it wouldn't even matter it was there. This is good if you need something right now and can't afford a really nice chill mat or other cooling pad.
2,"Cools well, but can be very noisy","This cooling fan does what it's supposed to do - i.e., cool your comp. It tends to be pretty noisy, though... especially if one of the fans tends to get offline like in mine. I bought a ZALMAN notebook cooler to replace it... and the Zalman is fanastic.In short, the propensity for being noisy substantially outweighs its cooling prowess. Don't buy it."
2,"great idea, needs some work...","This fan would work much better if it had some support legs ""inside by the fan-blades"". The light weight of the laptop causes the top plastic cover to rub on the fan blades."
4,cooling fans,Yes the Data Stor 3 fan notebook cooling pad works like a dream. Although a little small for my laptop 15 1/2 in. screen it doesn't hinder it's performance.The fans are very quite and the three led light are a nice feature along with the front switch to power it on and off.My laptop is much cooler now.Thank you
5,I LOVE IT!,"I bought this for my Xbox 360. Because as everyone knows the Xbox's overheat so easily. And i have been trying to find a way to keep it cool. So i tried this out. And the past 2 days i have used it, it has been great! It doesnt keep it ice cold, BUT it when i play for a couple of hours it keeps it nice and cool. I would recommend this to anyone that has an Xbox 360, and is trying to find a way to keep it cool."
4,Review for Datastore 3-Fan,"Pros: 3 fans, up to now it has supported my 15.4"" PC and working good.Cons: It is made of plastic, is not 100% silent but with acceptable level of noice. In general is a good product price wise."
3,good for price,"You really have to think about how you are going to be using this when thinking about buying it. It is feels extremely cheap. Honestly, I feel like I could break it simply by putting my laptop on it too hard. I definitely would not buy this if you intend on moving it around a lot since I doubt it could take the abuse. I keep it in the same spot and use it only when burning dvds, or running programs that cause my macbook to heat up a lot, so it works for me. I've only used it a few days, but it seems to cool my laptop off."
1,Worst cooling pad ever,"very bad quality, the plastic melted in two days due to the heat from my laptop. do not spend your money on this one."
2,"Worked well, but....","I've only had this product for a little bit, but I'm already sending it back. It worked great for the first week that I had it at school. I took it home with me over the weekend and the port came loose. After that it worked if I wiggled it around. I tried to email and call the manufacturers only the email bounced back and the number goes to voicemail.I'm sending this product back and will be purchasing a similar product but from a different company."
2,what about flavors?,"These are a pleasing size and retain a good texture, without the ""rubber eraser"" taste when chewed for a while, but all the various colors taste the same, with no decernable fruit flavors. The purple (grape?) may have a slight tang. They are not overly sweet, which is good, but have no interesting flavor(s). A disappointment."
3,Its Good But.......,"I like this album, it has some great songs like ""Honey Hush"" ""Wild Cherry"" etc. but my big complaint about this album is how they recorded Lonesome Dave's vocals on ""Fly By Night"" ""Golden Arrow"" and ""Nothin'I Won't Do"" his voice sound's muffled on those songs like he has something covering his mouth, its not as clear as the other songs, otherwise it is a good album."
2,Good to know RM but not good to learn,"If you just want to know what Revenue Management (RM) is all about, then this is a good book. But if you actually want to learn RM, even at a very basic stage, then this is not the right book for you. This book is all about what RM is, places where it can be used and how the author did what he did but doesn't actually get into teaching people about RM."
1,"Concerns about ""Calculus: A Modern Approach""","I own this book. It dives straight into derivatives and continues on from there - a very steep dive indeed for anyone new to the subject. In my opinion it proceeds with excessively complex explanations of what should be easily comprehended concepts of calculus. It may, in my opinion, be suitable for the calculus-adept student or teacher but falls significantly short in any attempt to teach the subject to a novice. I do NOT recommend this book to anyone attempting to understand calculus on his or her own (i.e. beginners). If this method is considered a modern approach, then perhaps we should fall back to methods that have turned fewer newcomers off to the subject. Consider ""Calculus Made Easy"" by Silvanus P. Thompson and ""Teach Yourself Calculus"" by Hugh Neil instead."
3,"Book is OK, not great.","This is a decent book, if you have little or no experience with games. Some of the tips on optimization for Flash are very helpful. However, many of the more complicated issues around building games are left out. For instance, there is a chapter on making ""scrolling"" games, a la Super Mario Bros. But, the whole chapter is devoted to building a level editor for the game. While very necessary, this is a much much simpler project than building the actual game. The difficult (and critical!) parts of making a game, like the engine architecture, are not explained at all. To find out how to make a working game, you really need to download the source code from the Friends of Ed website. This you can do without purchasing the book."
2,An Awkward Treatment of Time Series Econometrics,"Patterson's text is perhaps one of the worst econometrics textbooks that I have come across in recent years. The writing is cumbersome and unwiedy, the exposition is awkward, and the overall treatment of the subject is rather tiresome, uninspiring.The only reason that I did not give this book a ""one-star"" is that it could serve a useful purpose: it can show budding econometric textbook authors how not to write a textbook."
4,"Clever, but ...","This knife's blade mechanism is clever and different enough that you should probably add it to your collection. I've had none of the screw loosening problems mentioned in another review. That said, as I interpret the sparten instructions, you're supposed to be able to both open and close this thing with one hand. I cannot. Opening it is doable and probably would be smooth if you're blessed with gigantic hands. Closing is another matter. Once the release is pressed, the blade will ""fall"" from the open position to the mostly closed position ... then there's trouble. I can open and close dozens of knife designs one-handed -- some of them which aren't meant to be. But, for me, this is a 2-handed closer no matter what I try. Even Strong-Like-Bull, my son-in-law, can't single hand this one. (If anyone knows how, send a video.) But this ""problem"" isn't enough for me to dis this knife or CRKT. Very cool blade."
3,"Meh, there are better places to get into plato","This was a much more difficult and unrewarding read than I would have thought. The loops of rhetoric that Socartes and Protagoras weave around each other, while occasionally intriguing, often seem clumsy and confused, especially about how to respond to one another. I guess its useful in that it shows that misunderstanding worked in the ancient world as well as it does today. If you really really want to read Plato, there are better dialogues out there to choose from i.e. Meno, Gorgias, Timaeus."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"The magazine is fine, it is basically an advertisement for Canadian retailers however it does give some fashion tips and trends. The problem with Lou Lou Magazine is the Customer Service -- it is terrible. If you receive a damaged issue or do not receive an issue at all, you have to send an email to Customer Service. After sending six emails to so-called Customer Service, my issue was never resolved. Basically they send a canned email stating they are sorry for your inconvenience and we are investigating but my problem was never resolved. I had to keep following up and dealt with the same two individuals in Customer Service who did not have the ability and/or authority to resolve the matter. It was completely frustrating and with service like this it is no wonder the publishing world of magazines is in such dire straights."
2,Not great story for little ones.,I got this book for my 3 yr old son. He loves ABC books and pirates. This story is dry and doesn't engage him like other ABC books. H is for Haunted House is much better. It is engaging and he love sit.
5,Works as expected,No complaints. Best price I could find on the net. Will go back when I need more filters for next winter.
1,I had similar problem with water leaking.,"I have used other replacement filters and never encountered any problem.However using this particular filer, I ended up having the same problem with water leakage."
2,"beautiful color, few broken... terrible flavor","I have no problems with the seller or the shipping, but I really didn't expect these things to taste this awful. They aren't inedible, but what I get out of most gumball machines tastes far better- these have a definite rubber taste, a weird sweetness (not real sweet, just... chemically sweet I guess? it's weird) I am hoping this odd flavor isn't from sitting in a warehouse for years on end.If it seems like a cut an paste review, that's because it is. all 3 products (three flavors of gumballs) were identical."
5,The best cat care book I've ever used.,"I have used this book for 21 years, having had the same number of cats over those years. I was able to determine if I could do at-home treatment or they needed a vet. Excellent reference, information is easily found and very clear. Highly recommended by ""Phisty"", et al."
1,never expect to receive,I had been waiting for 2 months for this item. And was kept telling the shipment would be delayed.
1,Unofficial documentary thats officially a waste.,"Unofficial documentary that's officially a waste. A lousy scrap book style edited film of old David footage/photographs, unofficial, with ""Interview Exclusives"" with a handful of nobodies that claim to have known David, don't bother with this one. Buy some of David's official autobiographies instead."
3,DOA,"I put the card in with all precautions (wrist strap, etc.) in place. After running my recording software sound card installation tools,I tried the inputs and outputs. The inputs worked well (Mic in 1 & 2, and input 1 & 2), but the right output was very low and distorted.After a day, to make sure I wasn't plugging things in wrong (the wires are marked just output 1,2,3 ETC., NOT output 1 Left & Right, etc.) I realized the board was bad.On the plus side, the return process was very easy and quick.I might try another 1010, but I'm going to look into the other products out there first."
3,I cannot play all the speaker together when i watch movie.. or listening song.,the recording is fine... But I cannot play all the speaker together when i watch movie.. or listening song. Can any one help me??
2,Not that good...,"I was disapointed when I heard this CD, I was expecting catchy songs like Cool Kids and Dummy Up, but now this CD sits in its case except for the occanisnal playing of Automatic Rejector... I reccomend buying Emo, Television City Dream, or Beat is on the Brat instead..."
2,Stan Rogers Lives On,"This album is a dilemma for me: I enjoy Stan's writing and performance a great deal--and I dislike concert recordings. For me, the audience sounds and the performers' patter detract from the music. The ""liver"" the recording, the more it disappoints me--and this is one of the ""livest"" I've heard. There's plenty of spoken intro & banter and lots of shifting volume level as the performers move around the mikes. If you truly love Stan *and* if you truly love intimate concert ambience, you'll treasure this recording. Otherwise, stay away."
3,Wrote Herself Short,"I have the entire Donovan series and I have to say I was most disappointed by this particular book. Captivated, Entranced, and Charmed were all outstanding books with well written characters and plots. I'm sorry to say that Enchanted fell very short of the previous three tales. Yes, the story was cute and the characters of Liam and Rowan fit into it well enough, but there wasn't any of that sensual punch you found in the other books. Overall, as the last book in the series it was quite a let down."
2,"Same old Same Old, but undeniably creep!!!",Nora seems to be running out of ideas so she resorts to writing of the supernatural. Quite frankly the idea of a man turning into a wolf and then sleeping on the bed and watching the heroine take a bath is just plain creepy. The books was most assuredly not her best.
3,Ehhh,"I usually love Nora Roberts but this time, I was left confused. Some things were explained others weren't. Then at the end I was left hanging. Maybe the rest of the Donovon Legacy will be better."
5,Stan's usual high quality.,"""Barrett's Privateers"" alone was worth the price of admission. The rest are a treat. No turkeys here. I especially liked ""Athens Queen"" and ""Giant."" My one complaint is that the stepdancer's taps in ""Plenty of Hornpipe"" could barely be heard. As a stepdancer myself, I found this frustrating. But that's scarcely a fraction of a star off the CD's worth. Recommended."
3,Snarky and Bittersweet,"This memoir is funny,clever and engaging. Knipfel is an interesting guy to say the least. If ""Slackjaw"" hadn't come highly recomended to me, there's no way I would have read a book about a mentally-ill, guy who tried to kill himself several times before going blind. However, since I did, it was rewarding, humorous, proud and never depressing."
4,LED BY THE BLIND,"Slackjaw By Jim KnipfelThis well-written memoir of career setbacks, divorce, brain tumors, encroaching blindness, and miscellaneous failure is -- well, believe it or not -- it's funny and even warm-hearted. Knipfel has a gift for appreciating the quirky, the smart, and the loveable, whenever they appear in his world of both metaphorical and literal darkness."
5,"Good, fun read",A nice light hearted romance with totally believable characters.I really enjoyed reading this book.Looking forward to reading the author's next book.
3,good book,"alot of text, bit wordy, illustrations nice but lacking in color. great messages though. for older kids. wouldn't try to read it with a child all at once."
5,Yes of course!,"Of course all Sondheim fans should have this in their collection. Really a MUST HAVE. Then there's the Mandy and Bernadette thing and we all love them don't we! (If not, then maybe not for you!) Lovely, poignant and one of his best works, so it's lovely to have a DVD version of it !"
2,I don't know what people see in this show ...,"This is a very popular musical show, and yet I find it to be completely boring, and had to fast forward to get it over with. I'm not a fan of Mandy either, until his recent foray into the story of Homeland, which is the only thing I've ever seen him in that I liked."
3,great songs don't necessarily make great radio plays,"The heavy handed dramatic interpretation of ""harris and the mare"" rendered stan & co.s' interludes, although beautiful, somewhat forced and awkward amid the melodrama. I didn't realize stan had meant for his protagonist to come off as a cradle robbing christ figure. Bookended by the program's twilight-zone-ish camp, the work's folky feel seems mismatched. But hey, its still stan and i'm sure i'll give it quite a few more listens before any dust settles on it."
1,lame,"It Was very lame.Maybe if you and some Girls from work got together and had a little to much to drink this movie may get 2 stars.It is a chickflick,not a good chick flick but thats what best describes it."
4,Savoy Brown Redeaux,"As a devout Savoy Brown fan I had high expectations for Foghat's debut.I still remember putting the record on my turntable and cranking up my air guitar when I heard the crunching chords of the Muddy Waters remake, I Just Want to Make Love to You. Rod Price (RIP) never rally got his due in the pantheon of British guitarist, but he was, indeed, a fine slide player.And the late Lonesome Dave's blues howl, was unlike any other.This LP was worth the purchase price for the classic, Sarah Lee alone.Although it probably made many a blues purist cringe, for my money, Foghat's debut was their shining moment."
5,A 70's classic,"What can I say, the first album in a long line of terrific albums of the 70's. Classic rock at it's best."
2,so-so,I wasn't to crazy about Greg Kihn on a Whole but Jeopardy was the cut.it still rocks to this day.Much of The Songs here are so-so.But when he hits upon a good track it's Worth Checking out.
5,Gotch: An American Hero,"The life of Frank Gotch,world wrestling champion from Humboldt, Iowa, is very well presented in this book. It captured my interest from beginning to the end."
1,Poor research or maybe questionable motives,"The author seems to ignore some basic facts that any amateur researcher could easily discover. The most improtant being this: Gotch did works! He did them often. Wrestling was almost as worked then as it is now. Read the newspapers from that time for yourself and don't rely on the author. The reporters covering wrestling back then were in a position to know what was legit and what wasn't.Chapman seems to have some agenda built around creating a mythology of legitimate professional wrestling from a bygone era. Unfortunately, he has resorted to stretching the truth, and that's putting it kindly."
1,Problems,"This device worked OK, although I am not sure how high the through-put is. I had it for almost two months and had only disconnected it once. The last time I disconnected it, the RJ45 connector was more difficult to remove than I remember it was the first time, and then the cable would not latch. It would latch but as soon as the cable flexed a little it would pop back out. In the process of trying to get it to latch the little door broke. Linksys says they do not repair them and it was not covered by warranty so I threw away $30+. I would not recommend purchase as the RJ45 connection is very flimsy."
1,flimsy piece of hardware,"The plug to which the RJ-45 connector attaches is incredibly flimsy. It's very difficult to get it connected, and once it is connected, it very often becomes unattached. I've been using two of these for TiVos over the last couple of years. One adapter stays connected. The other breaks loose at least once every two weeks or so. This is a terrible design."
3,Good for what it is,"Yes, what others say is true. The door will break, eventually. I have had mine for 3 years and the door has just came off, but I was able to snap it back in place. It is loose though. As for holding the cable securly, I have never had the problem of it comeing loose, when the door was completely intact.So the bottom line is: the product works well, but it is not something you will have for ""many years to come."" It does travel well, though. I have dropped it a couple times and nothing has happened.Would I buy it again, no. There are other prodcuts available that I believe will work just as good and last longer."
