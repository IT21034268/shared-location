2,Poorly bound history book,"The history is nice, but that's something the professor should be interjecting. Also, this book is poorly manufactured. I bought it brand new and several pages had fallen out of the binding just weeks after purchase."
1,A Skeptical Disgrace,"Park probably debunks a number of false claims, but a significant number of valid claims are trashed as well. Park's methods are ridicule, character assassination, and an arrogant omission of published data that disagree with his premonitions. This book is a perfect example of Science becoming Religion in the hands of a master of public relations. Skeptics must address the literature, especially the peer-reviewed kind, and refute the methods or conclusions. In the case of global warming, cold fusion, magnetic healing and other topics, Park most certainly did not do this. Of about 12 published reviews, only 3 showed outrage at Park's methods, and only one was written by a reviewer who bothered to look up the facts on one topic."
1,Not a balanced portrayal,"I've been reading Bob Park's What's New column from the American Physical Society for some years now and this book appears to be a booklength version of that column. Park is not an objective physicist by any means. Physicists must walk a fine line between skepticism and open mindedness. Unfortunately, Park is simply skeptical and prefers to attack research which he doesn't understand (and doesn't try to understand!) rather than look at the research with an open mind. Admittedly, there is a tremendous amount a bad ""science"" out there such as creationism and belief in UFOs but people like Park are just as bad as creationists in his dogmatic and inflexible beliefs."
5,Best earplugs for swimmers.,"I have tried foam ear plugs of various types, wax, Doc's Pro-plugs (vented) and none of them work as well as these little purple things. One big advantage is that if it leaks, or if you need to take them out after you have been in the water, you can put them right back in, unlike the wax or foam plugs."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought these a while ago when I was swimming several times a week and soon realized that they are not worth the money.They did not last very long and within several weeks, they started tearing apart. They didn't seem to fit well and maybeI have small ear openings. With difficulty to put them in, they hurt. I ended up not wearing them. I suppose it's one ofthose things that can't be helped because they must be soft and pliable. But I won't buy these again. Logged on to Amazonto see what else is on the market so I can start swimming again in the winter."
5,The best written technical book I've read in years!,"If you want to learn how to make a professional looking website, with a minimum learning curve, then this is the book for you. I've been programming for over 21 years and this is one of the few books that I would rate as excellent. HTML alone will not produce a very good looking website, although it contains the basic foundation you need to start.Jim gives you ample information about the various tools to allow you to build your site with confidence. Using tools such as CSS, Tables, Frames, JavaScript,DHTML and XML. Each of these subjects is a book in themselves but Jim gives you enough knowledge to build a professional looking site without overwhelming you. The writing is clear, concise and fun, the examples and practices are straight forward and plentiful.If you're not an expert but want to build website's like one, then this one book you must own."
3,"Funny, but not a good reference book","If you wanna laugh, then this book is great for that, but I really don't reccomend using it to learn the language itself. There are far better books out there for that. I bought it simply because i did want a good laugh, should I want to learn actual Japanese, I'd get actual textbooks (should that be possible) or maybe an up-to-date dictionary to start out."
5,You're undecided?,"I can't believe I'm writing a review for Danny Elfman's best score and the single, greatest heroic score written for a comic book hero . . .Elfman's orchestral powerhouse begins immediately with the main theme. Elfman does let us breath sometimes but the finale takes the energy out of you!Highlight tracks:""The Batman Theme""""Batman to the Rescue""""Descent into Mystery""""Charge Of The Batmobile""""Attack Of The Batwing""""Up The Cathedral""""Waltz To The Death""""The Final Confrontation""""Finale""""Batman Theme Reprise""Why are you still reading?! BUY IT NOW! this soundtrack is what makes film scoring fun!"
3,"I like the pan , BUT","I have to agree with others , the pan warped on me also. The lid will not fit securely on the pan.... But other than that the pan seems good.... After reading other reviews , I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop."
5,Great Purchase!,"This is a very decent pan, at a very decent price. I would strongly consider purchasing other products from this company."
5,Essential for the everyday cook,"I had been using my stainless steel skillets to cook and left the chicken always overcooked no matter how I adjusted the temperature. I decided to purchase this because of the reviews and I""m so happy I did. I use it daily from cooking eggs to cooking main dishes and side dishes. Like I said in the title, essential items."
3,Low-quality anti-stick coating,"Over the years, I have noticed that the quality of T-Fal products falling. No exception for this one.The surface is coarse and even if you wipe the cooking surface with paper towel or tissue, the sand-paper-like (much more coarse than 00 sandpaper!) would gather paper fiber.The additional handle is a welcome feature. The grooves on the bottom prevents contacts with certain ranges and makes it hard to clean."
5,One fine read!,"I liked the way Kristine had to struggle to find the truth about herself and all those around her. Each of us does the same thing every day, we just don't stop to think about it. That's what made this book a fine, realistic book for me. In a word, wonderful. Katie Mc Innis"
5,A Real Delight,I have always been a fan of Ferm Michaels but I found this book to be exceptional....I laughed and I cried it kepy my interests and I loved the way she was able to intertwine all the characters...a definate read
5,"It has love, suspense, mystery all rolled into one exciting story.",I've read several of Fern Michaels books and I would rate this one as one of the best. It held my interest throughout the book. I especially enjoyed reading about the dogs and their antics. It's because of stories like this that will make me continue to read her books. I haven't been disappointed yet.
2,"Annoying, frustrating main character","The main character is frustratingly weak and trusting even when the object of her trust has proven to be a liar. I've liked Fern Michaels' books in the past, but this one was painful to read."
1,Ridiculous!,"This was one of the worst romance novels I've ever read. I expect to have to suspend my disbelief somewhat, but this book was ridiculous. The dialogue was beyond believeable, the situations were contrived, the characters were not appealing. The heroine was a total weak-spined wimp. I cannot believe there are so many people who enjoyed this book. Don't waste your money or your time. It does not get better as it goes on."
1,Too painful to even finish!,"I would like to believe that there are few women in this world as idiotic as the main character of this book. But, hey, I'm sure most women would welcome a man into their home after they stole eight million dollars from them. Please. Give your readers some credit and your characters a brain. I wouldn't even recommend this book as a quick read for the beach. Horrible."
1,YUK,"I must admit I haven't finished this book (listening to the audio version) but I already know I hate it. This sap of an immature women seems to spend all of her life sobbing her eyes out, passive aggressive in the extreme. The story line was incredulous. For example, she starts a dog business and can afford a full time veterinarian, what the heck is she running some kind of super puppy mill. Her children leave in a huff, she has no contact for three years when she shows up at their college graduation and all of a sudden she mom of the year. What a roll model for motherhood. What a pile of sophmoric garbage."
3,Not the same without Esther Rolle!,"This was the season that Esther Rolle had left with dying Carl for Florida. SAdly, I am giving it only three stars because the show was still good but not as good as the first three seasons with both parents. Anyway, Willona Woods played by the sassy and entertaining Janet Dubois adopts an abused girl, Penny, played by Janet Jackson. JOhnny Brown as Booker is also a regular and the three Evans kids are still here. While the show may have hit it's peak two seasons ago, the show still has our favorites. Janet Jackson's performance as abused child, Penny, was relatively done with dignity to entertain and inform the audiences about the dangers of child abuse. Like so many issues, Good Times had always managed to deliver a realistic portrayal of such a timely issue."
3,"What you see, is what you get.","Decent belt. Nothing special, what you see is what you get. Takes some time to break in, but afterwards does the job."
2,Zero emotion!,"After reading about this guy in Guitar Player, I can only say I'm majorly disappointed. The uninitiated should be warned that they're not buying a ""regular"" CD. There are no vocals in any of the songs - just a bunch of tracks that sound like jams by a bunch of session players. Which is essentially what Hiland is. Yes, the playing is technically proficient. Hence my 2 stars instead of just one (which is really where my satisfaction with this CD lies). But this guy is no new ""master of the Telecaster"" or anything close! There is nothing jaw-dropping here, folks, and all the hype is definitely UNjustified. Don't buy."
5,Versatile,"This CD showcases Johnny's versatile playing talent and style. He plays some sweet guitar 'licks' the whole way though the CD. I enjoy all types of guitar music, so for me, it's a great CD. Those that want just one type of song on this CD are forgetting it's his first CD and is impressive exactly the way it is: a compilation of great sounding tunes! 5 stars go to his playing ability/talent, no matter what you think of the song mix for his first CD. Branch out and enjoy, this CD is awesome."
4,Some valuable ideas for establishing a Web-based store.,"Basically a nuts-and-bolts behind the scenes guide to what it takes to establish and run a Web-based store. Doesn't get deeply involved in true E-commerce; more focused on a one-to-one type of Web store, rather than Amazon.com-type of E-commerce.It was exactly what most small Web stores would find handy.I had to cut 2 points because of all the typos. Seems they rushed this to press..."
5,Works fine for me,"As others have mentioned this is a nice slim unit that comes with two power cords (an 18"" and a 10 foot) - you choose which one you want to use. It is mountable with 4 holes (I have mine mounted behind my plasma TV). It has only two outlets. The indicator LED lights let you quickly check on the status. My only complaint is that the metal strip logo doesn't seem to stick too well and is coming off - that doesn't affect the functionality though."
2,What a waste!,"This book tells us a story of some terrorist that kidnap five girls in France and ask for five things, each thing that the french people does they release a girl, the problem with this story is that the french people wanted to make an international problem and they made all the meetings in New York and nobody in the world care except Israel, In this book never goes out the secret service of any country, the French police makes all the arrangements and they solve the case, just boring.This is the first book that I read that the prologue doesn't has anything to do with the rest of the book, so you can skip this part of the book as well as other 100 pages that just have words that doesn't have to do anything in the book.SKIP this book, it doesn't worth it."
3,Reggae hits 2001,"This is another installation of the popular reggae hits series from jamdown records. All in all, it is a good album. All of the songs are enjoyable, unfortunately, a full 6 of them use the same riddim (rythm) and this makes the songs get old pretty quickly. If you are a big fan of reggae or are a collector of the series, go ahead and get this album then copy the songs onto mix CDs so you dont have to hear all the songs with the same riddim one after the other."
3,Is the thrill really gone?,"""Spend The Night"" is hardly a good album when compared to the stellar work the Isleys did in the 1970s. It is however a reasonably decent (if a bit trite) attepmt at the kind of elegant sould-R&B music the group usaed to make before the Isley-Jasper-Isley split in '84. Angela Winbush's production tends to be a bit sparse and synth-heavy, but the total effect is classy, if a bit dated nowdays. Lyrics are a sore spot, especially on the second half of the album. Overall, unless you really love the stellar title track, or the equally good ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" you would be better served to buy the Isleys earlier work, an Angela Winbush album (where the same themes are repeated and done much better), or the mid '90s smash ""Mission to Please,"" which marks the real returm of guitar virtuoso Ernie Isley to the mix."
4,My Shirt is Buttoned at Last,"I bought a button hook. Not quite what I had in mind, but it does the trick. I couldn't button cuffs on my shirts or sometimes down the front because of arthritis or my long fingernails. Now I can button everything and can use it for a couple of other things too (can't remember what now, but I know I thought of other applications for it!)."
2,"Poor Seller, defective product","This product should not have been shipped.The product was bent and the lid would not stay latched. Whether this was an exception, I don't know.I had to bend sections of the basket with pliers to get the lid to stay latched. Consequently, the white coating got damaged in the process.This seller demonstrated a lack of concern and attention to detail."
5,book review,comprehensive review of the ceremonies and customs that I needed to know for my job as XO.
4,How very sad,"I thought this book was very well written. About Mary Bell, well I sure wouldnt want her around my children. I feel very sad for this woman but here is the definition of antisocial personality disorder: Hostile to or disruptive of the established social order; marked by or engaging in behavior that violates accepted mores. A personality disorder characterized by chronic antisocial behavior and violation of the law and the rights of others.Could she have been different in a more positive enviornment, I think so, but I believe she is still a creation of her upbring.I would be afraid.VERY GOOD"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I can't believe everyone is giving this five stars! This CD is very entertaining indeed...for a minute or two (and only if you're one who is tickled by such kitsch [and if I weren't, I'd probably give this just one star]); however, the spooky organ, the gongs, the thunder claps and several ""Hail Satan!"" refrains that accompany the Black Pope's monotous baloney will likely cause you to consider this as your haunted house soundtrack come next Halloween. (Hint: repeat track one--which clocks in at over 18 minutes--ad infinitum.) Alternatively, I recommend putting your money toward the documentary Satanis (1970) instead. --One gets to see The Black House which is no more! LaVey's lion Togare! And naked chicks on the altar! Hail Satan!"
2,"Interesting, But Not Impressive","For anyone who has already read The Satanic Bible or practiced Satanic Ritual, this CD will bring no surprises. It's basically a ritual exactly as LaVey described in his book. Nothing spectacular. LaVey uses J.S. Bach's Hymn To God as the intro, although he rather unoriginally calls it The Hymn To Satan. The Battle Hymn is included, which is the high point of the recording. An unlisted march is also present, so after you think that the CD is over, keep listening. Readings from LaVey's Book of Satan chapter in the Satanic Bible are included with backgroung music by Wagner, Sousa and others. Again, no real surprises here; only worth the money if you're really interested in LaVey memorabilia, but guaranteed to tick the Christians off."
4,"Decent book, ok photos","One of the drawbacks of buying gardening books online is that you can't see the photos. If I had thumbed through this book in a bookstore I don't know if I would have purchased it. Not that it doesn't have a lot of good information and ideas, but the photos could be better: the color is garish and over-saturated and the images actually look blurry. Also, many of the plant combo photos are very close up, which doesn't help when you are trying to figure out how to place your perennials when planting. For me, a good gardening book has to not only give useful information and how-tos (which this book does for the most part), but it has to inspire with lovely photos! And that is where this book disappoints. I do like the illustrations of various combinations.Addendum:Four years later, I find that I still look through this book every spring for inspiration and ideas. So overall I'd say a good addition to one's gardening library!"
4,A must-listen for Floyd fans looking for an alternative,"This band is NOT trying to be early '70s Floyd. While its instrumental work may remind you of Floyd at times, there are completely different inspirations. Check out Signify, a work much more indicative of PT, but don't miss this one."
4,Pretty good...,"The instructions are fairly easy to follow, and the recipes I have tried are great. However, the pictures of marinated dishes don't show the marinades as mixed together, which is weird. Also, I wish the author(s) were a little more clear on exactly which cuts of beef to use on the dishes...it just says ""sliced beef"" or ""tender sliced beef"". I'd like to know which cuts they would recommend."
3,North American Wildlife: Birds by Reader's Digest,"The book arrived in great condition, no problem with that. It should be great to use to identify any birds you might see. It is much easier to use than another book i have ""The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Birds. It has the text and the pictures in one place, which makes it WAY easier to use than the formerly mentioned. You wouldn't confuse the artwork for photographs, but the depictions seem pretty accurate."
4,Nice ingredient in moisturizers,I use this product to make a hydraspray that is a wonderful way to keep skin soft and moist.
2,Creepy,"This is a fairly well-written book, but when I read it as an eleven year old, it scared the heck out of me. The whole concept of the living dolls and the dead-but-not-gone uncle -- it's just too weird, and not in a good way."
2,ultimately disappointing,"The story premise was very good, but... The characters were not fully developed. How or why a change was effected in Maggie was not clarified. How Maggie moved into and got accepted into another family and how she became a loving person is unknown. Uncle Morris is a mere sketch of a person, and the aunts are outlines of a sketch. Seems that the author was up against a deadline and had to tie things up before the story matured in the author's mind."
4,Kara's Review of Behind the Attic Wall,"This book was about an orphan, Maggie, who could never fit in at orphanages, or girls' schools. She would get thrown out of everyone she stayed at, until finally her great aunts took her in. Maggie hated it at first, and thought it was just another school, but after a couple of days realized that she was the only kid there. She still pretended to hate it, but liked it a little more. Maggie started hearing voices. At first she thought of it as nothing because they were so faint, but then one day she truly heard a man and woman talking. She thought it was her aunts having people hide to tell her what to do, but her aunts did not hear it. Maggie grew to listen to them always, and found out they were looking for someone. It was Maggie.In this book Maggie is telling the story. I thought it was a great book, and that any age would enjoy it."
2,Ordered wrong product,"I guess I would have liked a written desciption of the ingredients while I was ordering. I thought ARTH-X was the same as ARTH-X Platinum. I was wrong. ARTH-X does not contain glucosamine or chondroitin, the two main ingredients I was looking for. I ordered the wrong item, and did not realize it until after I opened it, so can;t return it. Other than that, the prouduct was delivered timely."
2,monster bass!,"This game really bummed me out after I played it. it didn't have the excitement that we were looking for as we played it, nor did it have the idea that was given from what we read about it. Sorry"
4,"Very witty and well written, but a little slow.","The writing in this book was fun and full of interesting insight and metaphors. But the plot was pretty shallow and repetative and boring. I kept waiting for some BIG thing to happen and nothing ever really did. Just small blips then a ""big"" ending that left me underwhelmed. Good book, worth the read, but don't get your hopes up to high."
4,Excellent beginner book,"I teach programming at the university level and have recently switched to this publication as the main text for my classes. The book provides fantastic examples and explains concepts at a level a beginning programmer can understand. As with any text, the solutions are available in the instructor's manual (available from the publisher). The extensive support provided by the publisher's web site and by the authors themselves is unmatched. As this book was written to be instructive, it lacks somewhat as a reference guide, but is still a valuable resource for any junior programmer."
3,"Want information about mainframes & cobol, it's not here.","This book is excellent for the Cobol language, but when it comes to talking about Mainframes, only in the title do you find the word Mainframe. I could have missed the import of the book, but when 'mainframe' is not even in the index, nor is MVS (Multiprogramming Virtual Storage), CICS (Customer Information Control System), TSO (Time Sharing Operation: a program that allows the typing of the Cobol program) JCL (Job Control Language, a batch like computer language used to link and compile and interface between the programmer and MVS). I welcome ""Constructive"" corrections to that fact. I truly find the title ""Cobol: From Micro To Mainframe: Preparing for a New Millenium"" to be misleading! Had there been a better description of the book contents, I would have not ordered the book directly from the publisher."
2,Disappointed,"I had great hopes for this book. Upon reading it, however, I was grossly disappointed. Too many cliches, poor grammar, a limited vocabulary, and a disconnected theme all detract from what might be a very nice story. Get a new editor!"
2,Wanted it to work out... but just too noisy.,"I purchased this for my crawl space a few weeks ago. We've had dampness issues and with all the Atlanta area flooding/rain, I figured it would be an asset. I'm sure it is doing some good with air movement but it's so darn loud despite having exchanged it once already and making sure to install it to manufacturer's specs. From the reviews I had read, I expected to not hear this at all. However, in my essentially ranch style home with a 3-4 foot tall crawl space, it's as loud or louder than my A/C. Even my wife who normally thinks I blow things out of proportion and am too sensative thought it was just too noisy, especially at night.I'll probably move it to the a far corner of my home and set it for ""biblical floods"" only, the humidistat at 80 percent or higher. I'd give it one start but I'm sure it is moving air under the house, so it's probably doing 2 stars worth of good-but at a price."
5,what a find,I don't have a crawl space. I have a pre-war coop with a small bathroom window. It has been impossible to find a fan to fit it & there is no other option for venting moisture.This little machine fits perfectly. I turn it on when using the shower so I can't speak about efficiency in automatic mode.
2,Weak Movie,"I was going to only give this a one star, but Joey Lauren Adams is really in the movie even though it's just a supporting role. Supporting what? A very stupid movie !"
3,It tries...,"Despite apparently suffering from a director without a funny bone, more less experience directing comedies there are a few really good scenes. The satirical treatment of rap videos was hilarious. It does drag at points and some of the humor is esoteric. Overall it's worth watching if you're not expecting Oscar nominations for best comedy... Silly, rediculous situations, satire and goofy are keywords for this movie. As romantic comedies go, guys are more likely to like this one than most."
3,"too much rambling, not enough exercises","This book may best be used as a reference book. I bought it thinking I could learn the program by going through the book and doing the exercises, but I quickly lost interest due to the dry, very technical presentation. There are very lengthy dicussions, followed by extremely simple and short exercises that do nothing to prepare you for the exercises at the end of the chapter (and the book does not contain solutions to those either, nor am I sure how word scrambles are supposed to help one learn the program. This book does contain a lot of information and once I do learn the program (with the help of a different book, I imagine), I think it will come in handy when dealing with a specific problem."
2,"Frosty--5 stars, Frosty Returns-0 stars","Frosty is a perfect classic as always. Great story and characters. But, boy Frosty Returns makes this one you should probably skip. First, the story and songs are weak. Second, Christmas isn't even mentioned. The directors have fallen for the left wing anti-Christmas agenda, resulting in the kids school having a ""Winter Carnival"" instead. Pathetic. The real Frosty would melt with anger."
2,Frosty Returns?,This is the worst cartoon I have ever seen. The original frosty is really good. I will never watch Frosty Returns more than the once I have seen it.
1,Frosty the Snowman/Frosty Returns,I was looking for the original Frosty the Snowman that I used to watch on TV. This was nothing like I expected
2,"Wonderful Original Frosty, Frosty Returns is HORRIBLE","Everybody loves and has grown up with the original Frosty. The movie Frosty Returns is AWFUL! It portrays the parents/adults in the movie as being grumpy and actually nasty and mean about the winter season. The teacher is a mean old ugly character that is on the verbal attack on the child(ren). In Frosty Returns the children tell the adults how it is and why, very disrespectful. It is also a movie that has some political correctness in it.. mentioning recycling (which is all good but we know what we need or not need to be doing there) never did we once hear the word Christmas. WE have never seen a holiday movie so NEGATIVE, MEAN and EVIL spirited. We are returning our movie combo. We already had Frosty but thought Frosty Return was the one very similar to the original Frosty but the one where he gets a bride. Anyone know the title to that movie?"
1,disapppointing choice,Great selection of beautiful songs--that's the plus. Too bad they are arrainged in such an abysmally slow tempo with every note drug out to the max that it's almost painful to listen to them. I'd think twice (or three times) before buying this CD unless you can preview it in advance and the tempo is to your liking.
4,why not more?,"just one listen will be all it takes for you to think...why don't we have more cd's like this now? For pure enjoyment, this is perfect for anyone who likes to listen to an orchestra at it's peak."
5,Beyond The Sea/ New Limelight CD by Frank Chacksfield,My husband and I have an LP record of this music that we purchased many years ago to play on our stereo set. We have searched a long time to find it on a CD so we could play it on our Bose'. I finally found it this year on Amazon so I purchased it for my husband as a Christmas gift. Once again we are enjoying the music we love. We particularly love Ebb Tide and no one plays it like Frank Chacksfield and his orchestra! Thanks to amazon.com we found this CD.
4,cool watch,works great...stop watch is easy to use. only downside is setting the time and using the window clock when the main hands are over it. still worth the annoyance.
5,Excelente reloj deportivo (resistente),"Excelente reloj, se ve mejor en ""persona"" de lo que muestra la foto. Es especial para personas jovenes (y tambien jovenes-adultos), ya que tiene un diseño deportivo. Ideal para personas que trabajan al aire libre o en trabajos que requieran algun esfuerzo fisico: este reloj es bien resistente.Lo compre de cumpleaños para un amigo, y quedo fascinado! Se ajusta facilmente y es rapido de programar.*********This review is for Latin American customers (like me), you ""americans"" already have enough reviews and information to check about it."
3,Face/dial is small,Its a good watch for the money i paid -- but we aware that face/dial of this G-Shock is smaller than new models. And you cant really reach the digital time unless you 'hit' the light button...
4,Pretty good,"Love this watch, especially love back light. The only problem I have with this watch is the calendar, it would jump a day and not be accurate sometimes."
3,An okay watch,"Great watch with a few annoying flaws1. the digit display is only thing that lights up... dont expect the hands to glow bright enough to make any kind of difference2. there is no contrast between the hands with the background and that makes it very hard to see3. to set the analog hands you got to literally go only by the minute hand... which can take a good 5 minutes to set4. the buttons are to small.. they really should be extended a little bit out more5. when the hands are at 6 o'clock its kinda hard to see the digital displayI probably wouldn't buy again, but i am content enough to wear til it breaks"
4,Very nice watch,"It is a very nice watch, the design, the ability to have 2 different times, G-Shock, etc. It is not as big as I thought it would be, but nice."
2,"Don""t waste your funds",The watch too small and look cheap when it is on your hand. The light is not enough for the watch so it doesn't really serves a purpose. remmendation- watch should be bigger and better light.
4,Great Watch,Love this watch. Only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is the face is a little small for a guys G-Shock.
3,ehh,It's nice but not as big as I'd like. Plus I would like if it said the date. And It's hard to see the time.
3,Entry level watch at best,"This watch looks ok, but is a basic entry level watch (overall an not only for a g-shock). I have cheaper Casio watches with more functionality.It does not have world time (varying time zones), a very simple stop watch (not multi-stops), one alarm (all my other casio watches has at least 3), no hourly signal, no countdown timer, and no DST settings etc.This watch is very basic, and is suitable for a child. If you love functionality this is not the watch for you. If you dont care and want an inexpensive G-Shock then this is a great entry level watch."
2,Repair Disappointment,This manual is probably suited for more advanced do-it-yourself repair individuals. Step-by-step instructions are vague and confusing. I identified an error (PCV valve location on '95-98 engines) on my first review which threw me off totally. I'm sure there are plenty of other errors. I'm not thrilled at all of the blow-up drawings. I just don't trust the book period!
3,Ouch! Bumps ankles,"I have narrow bony feet with a low profile (don't laugh). I usually wear a size 8.5. In these shoes I'd go down 1/2 a size. The shoes are comfortable in many ways except one-the outer edges are too high causing them to hit my ankle bones. Sadly, I am unable to wear this shoe because of my low-profiled feet."
3,Indigo Women's Duchess Shoe review,"The shoes are very cute but unfortunately I had to return them.The right shoe hurt my heel. It could be because I wear sandalsmost of the time here in Arizona, and my feet aren't used to ahigh backing rubbing against my heel. My sister in Indiana has a pair andfinds them very comfy, so they could still be worth a try for other interested customers."
1,Waste of money,"Material is too weak to hold standard wheelbarrow. Bracket broke immediately after wheelbarrow was loaded on it for the first time.October 5, 2009: I should mention that I bought the LeHigh Crawford Wheelbarrow Holder #WBH-6 afterwards. It cost less and has been holding up my heavy duty wheelbarrow reliably for almost two years now."
4,Works well,"I read the other reviews for this item and was leery about purchasing one. However, I've had my wheelbarrow hanging on the bracket for about six months now and haven't had any problems. Installation was simple andit was obvious how I was supposed to hang the wheelbarrow. There are other hooks out there that serve the same purpose, but I like the clean lines of this one."
3,Great for ladders and wheel Barrows.....not so Bicycles,"Advertised as a bike storage rack..... Main Bar on my bike is at a slant, it becomes a balancing act."
5,Functional - Does What It Was Designed To Do!,"I have a fairly heavy clay soil and feared it would just bog down. Generally, it doesn't bog at all. Roots can obviously be a problem if it hangs in them, but it then easily reverses out. I have a fairly strong cordless drill motor, and suspect that contributes a lot to the success. It can gum with mud under some circumstances, but I probably shouldn't be planting bulbs in those circumstances, and, anyway, it's easy to just wipe the mud off.Great item at a good price."
2,Best for younger readers...,"I had to read this book for a college class (Literature for Adolecents) and was less than thrilled by it. I think it is certainly on a very low reading level, while at the same time using stream-of-consiousness techniques that could be confusing for some younger readers. The plot is very predictable and the characters are not very engaging. However, younger readers would probably not see the predictablness in the plot as much (they haven't had as much experience with plots as older readers and so don't know the patterns as well). Also, maybe a younger reader could relate to the story and the characters better. It is written from the point of view of a young girl and the scentence structure and language, as well as the mentality, show it. I don't know. I never read it when I was younger so I can't say that a younger reader would enjoy it, but they would very likely enjoy it more than an adult......"
2,This book is simply not worth it.,"I'm sorry to say, I found it rather boring. But this is just one opinion. If you read this book, add your opinion."
4,A little too short,"There were some recycled tracks on here, so that took away from this release, but the tracks were definitely off the chain. One of the best form the Bay working with THE best rapper out Southern Califonia? It was bound to be tight. I really loved ""Playin Hard"" even though Daz wasn't on it, ""Think Smart"" cause San Quinn came way to vicious on this kicked back beat. ""Still Hustling"" has to be dope, it got a funky beat and when Daz busts, it makes me nod my head and just say ""Hell Yeah."" ""Street Life"" has to be my favorite since the beat is gangsta to the fullest and Daz's opening verse is enough to make the album worth buying. I know it seems that I enjoyed the tracks only with Daz on them, but this album is a great representation of the best SoCal rapper teamed up with, in my opinion, the best region in rap music, The Bay."
3,atleast its funny,"I was dissapointed in the book. I truely hate to cook, and found many of the recipes seem to be for those who actually want to chop onions and green peppers, or spend time hunting for all the right spices. I'd rather buy a prepackaged mix, or something frozen. The author does have a good sence of humor though, and you cant help but chuckle."
5,What a treat!,"This was such a treat, to read a children's book by John Lithgow. I have only known him as an actor, so this was interesting to pick up. I loved this story! It has a magical element that both children and adults will love, I am sure. The choice of vocabulary he uses, alone, is amazing. Children, (and maybe even adults), will find new words, or artists mentioned in this book. This squirrel loves art. It makes one almost giggle how he after observing many works of art, he comes to make his own, and...(well, you just have to read the book to see how it ends.) It is a very cute story, and if you are like me, it will get you thinking about the sqirrels you have seen in your life that have more than one color on their tail. A very cute thing to watch for with the children. It will bring a smile to your face."
1,A Waste Of Time And Money,This dvd is incredible short and not very informative. You could ask the guy at the plumbing supply store how to do the things they show you in this dvd. No wonder they don't list the dvd's contents...It's not much of a list. I think there is a used copy for less than a dollar (plus postage). If this thing was free it would still be a waste of time.
1,Absolutely Rubbish and an insult to the depth and scope of the African culture,"Unbeknownst to non-Africans there is a strong movement to end the co-opting, exploitation and misrepresentation of the African culture. These cards are a prime example of the lack of knowledge that the 'artist' (and I use that term loosely) has of the scope and depth that African culture encompasses and it is clear that a non-African produced these cards. It is time for non-Africans to stop using the cultural and intellectual property of Africa for monetary gain. These cards are rubbish and foolish and so are the people who choose to use them (assimilationists are included in that category)."
2,Don't Waste Your time,"If you want to learn about different areas of New Zealand to assist you with planning your trip, don't waste your time watching this."
1,Didn't Like it,"I previewed the songs before I bought it, they sounded nice. When I got it and heard the whole song they were pretty painful. Choose wisely."
1,Skip it.,I enjoy Bank's non-sci-fi work. At least I did until I read this book. Its pretty terrible.
3,Good insights,"It's very helpful to read this book since St. Teresa gathered the wisdom from her own experience and the life experience of many others. There's a lot of wisdom to be learned. However, I am not sure if everything is biblical. I would approach it with a prayerful and humble mind."
5,SPECTACULAR ACOUSTIC COMPILATION,"Much Respect to Peter Tosh, the musician. Awesome acoustic guitar and vocal work on display here. Tosh truly was an extraordinary guitar player. Well chosen interview clips intermixed with the tracks, similar to Bob Marley and the Wailers' ""Talkin' Blues"" Album. Essential to overstanding Tosh's ability as both an orator and a 'player of instruments...Must have."
3,NOT for airplane travel,"I bought the item to take my dog on a plane when I travel. The advertisement shows it under a plane seat, however, it is way too big to fit under any plane seat. Its huge! If you intend to take it on a plane, dont buy this. Anything else, and it could be perfect. I am going to return it.So after emailing the company about this return, I was informed I would pay all the shipping to get it to me, the shipping to get it back to them, and most likely a 3% restocking fee. In other words, I will get nothing back even though the picture in the advertisement shows this huge crate fitting under a plane seat. Which, is simply impossible. False advertising! This is a crock. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
1,A Great Show Butchered...No Sale!,"WKRP is one of my top 5 favorite TV shows ever, but I won't be buying this shoddy release."
5,Big Deal!!,"OK - so we finally get a 'KRP box set - episodes are for the most part uncut for the first time since they aired and people are complaining the music isn't the same?So what! We're talking about a very small part of the show - OK - so seeing Johnny Fever zonk out with sunglasses on to a generic rock band instead of Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" isn't still funny? Don't most of the fans of this show have massive music collections already? The show is smart enough to transcend this small defect and I for one am enjoying it all over again for the first time since the mid 80's - especially all the scenes I missed during reruns then. ""Fish Story"" alone is worth the price of admission. There's far worse things in the world then this very minor editing ""snafu""!!! And for the record, Bailey Quarters is much ""foxier"" than Jennifer Marlowe! Have fun and enjoy these! Please!!! I want more seasons on DVD soon!!!!!"
1,WKRP,"I was going to buy, until I read the reviews. I see Faux is screwing us again. What is up with the syndicated versions, we want the orginals. I can over look the music thing, but not the cutting of scenes! Wat to drop the ball Faux!"
1,Disappointed,"I saw the negative reviews earlier. I decided this problem would be rectified, and I would make my purchase. I consider this program ""an old friend"". I would purchase all seasons, if shown in their entirety, unedited. What a shame for fans like me, who would have paid the price neccessary for the complete shows. Only an idiot, with no idea of what this show was about, would take out the music from this program. It would make as much sense to delete all scenes with Johnny Fever, or Heaven forbid, Les Nessman. The music was as important as any of these lovable characters.So now, this show, like some of my other friends from high school days, have changed. And not for the better. Shame on those responsible."
1,Will not buy,"I will not buy this based on the review of edited scenes and deleted music. This show was by far one the best comedy's to date on television. We still use lines from it, and it holds its own with content. I hope Fox reconsiders this move, and tries harder to get it right. Maybe they will get it, I doubt it though."
1,Pre-order cancelled,"After reading the news about what is actually on these DVDs, I had to cancel the pre-order. I was so excited when I heard this was coming out. The early info said that Hugh Wilson was involved, and I had hoped it would be the same quality effort as was put into the short lived Sledge Hammer! series when it came to DVD.I can live with the music changes to get the DVD's out, but I cannot justify spending money for episodes that are just 22-minute syndication cuts. I can hardly watch them on TV-Land or wherever they show up now and then because of that the cut scenes.Can't get Pink Floyd ""dogs""? Don't cut the scene! Go get some audio of some freak'n dogs barking and dub it in!Unbelievable.Sorry Fox, you will have to do MUCH better for me to spend money on this.Just to make sure there is no confusion; I *LOVE* WKRP, but not enough to spend money on crappy DVDs."
1,"Huge, huge disappointment","I was all ready to pre-order and then thank god I read some of the reviews. I knew about the controversy surrounding the cutting of original music but I was not aware that some of the episodes are not even the full version but instead are a cut syndication version.Sorry, but I won't be buying. Give me WKRP uncut and with original music and I'll buy it in a heartbeat.EDIT - To all those giving this set 4 and 5 stars....You do realize that the episodes are edited right? They are the truncated syndication versions. I could possibly live without the original music, but I can't live with ""edited for syndication: versions of my favorite TV shows."
4,"Good show, very dated","I never watched this show as a kid. Watching it now is funny--it's VERY 70's. Very dated, but in a fun way. I enjoy watching it. Many people have written about being upset that the original music isn't there, but I found that it didn't detract from the enjoyment at all."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"DO NOT BUY THIS ABORTION! This is an abomination, a show about a RADIO station where the MUSIC has been RUINED! It's like the Mona Lisa with no SMILE! Like Gone With The Wind without TARA! BOYCOTT ALL FOX DVDS UNTIL THEY FIX THIS!"
3,He said that he loves this gift.,I bought this DVD for a friend and he said that he really did love it. I think that he has watched it twice so far.
4,just the way i remember it,"I wanted to get this because I always enjoyed the show growing up. Some of the past reviews stated they were disappointed that the original music used at the time is not used in the DVD's now. It is a little strange when you know that thats not the song that is suppose to be playing, but, the show is still funny. I am glad i purchased it and will continue to watch it when i want a great laugh."
4,Memorites Restored,I'm not quite through watching this but ith only 4 shows left to go I am amazed at how well I remember this show considereing that I saw it once and not again till now. It holds up remarkably well. (Though I wonder what someone today would make of the teletype machine.) It doesn't need a laugh track. I deduct one star becuase they weren't able to license all the music but the acting remains one of the fine example of comedy.
2,Dissapointed,"I have to agree with many of the nay-sayers about this DVD. I loved this show and they've blown it by editing the soundtrack. Some of the jokes and the whole theme of certain shows were highlighted by the soundtrack. I bought it because I loved the show, but it's with a heavy heart and big dissapointment. I hope they release season 2 as-is...heck...I'd rather have crappier quality and an intact show than the crap they give us in the Season 1 set. As for copyrights...what a bunch of crap...these artists should be thrilled their music is getting airplay through this popular series. Heck...they would even boost their sales for a new generation if they'd let it alone!"
1,Butchered- do not reward Fox for this!,"Two unforgivable decisions: 1) editing out the original music; 2) using the shorter syndication versions vice the original aired episodes. It's a show about a radio station switching format to rock - and THEY REPLACED THE ROCK MUSIC WHICH WAS OFTEN TIED DIRECTLY TO THE PLOT?? I love WKRP, and would have happily paid double the price listed for the original uncut versions, but cannot buy this shameful hack job. YOO-HOO IDIOTIC TV EXECS: STOP DESTROYING THE TV MEMORIES OF OUR YOUTH BY BUTCHERING THESE CLASSICS! I hope the marketing genius responsible for that decision loses his/her job."
1,"I was ready to fork over the cash, but ... no tunes, no sale.","I was really looking forward to this release, until I read about the removal of the music that was originally used, and even parts of certain scenes, from the show.This was very disappointing news. But at least I still have my $26 ..."
1,Aiiiiiiiigggggghhhhh!!!!,"Thanks for all the tip-offs in the reviews here. I was eagerly awaiting this, but now I've canceled my pre-order. This show was about a _rock_ radio station. If they cannot play the music, then it guts the core of the show--a great show. And why the heck would I want chopped down versions of the episodes rather than the original length versions? If they're doing this to the show, I would not be surprised if the image transfer, the audio, and the other things like the menus are lousy too."
4,Still Great,"I read many of the reviews prior to the show being released and wasn't sure what to expect. I've seen about half of the episodes and I found the show still just as funny and entertaining as when I saw WKRP when it first aired. Two of my teenage children have been watching them with me and they both love the show. Neither have seen any of the episodes before this.Yeah, the music has been replaced but I can't say it's that noticeable. The replacement music matches the sound of the 70's. If you didn't already know the music had been replaced you wouldn't think anything of it. It wasn't the music that made this show a clasic. It was the stories and the acting and they are still great. I am looking forward for the release for season 2.It's too bad so many people gave this a 1 rating without having actually viewed this release. The low overall rating is undeserved. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the music was replaced."
4,"Boogers, turkeys, and the Buckeye News Hawk Award..oh my!","Alrighty folks...I got the set for Christmas and sat down and shamelessly watched the entire thing in two sittings. I was ten when the show first aired; thought Johnny was cool and wanted glasses just like Bailey's. Okay-so the music isn't the same (except for the Boogie Oogie Oogie song)and you don't hear Foreigner's Hot Blooded while Les is getting dressed for his big date with Jennifer. The shows run full length (20-25 minutes)each and I couldn't see any editing. If you enjoyed the show and can live with ""different"" music (which is actually pretty good-it's not elevator music) you won't go wrong buying the set. I will be buying the second season set when it becomes available."
1,no good,"Sorry. The music, to me, is as important to these episodes as the actors. I will hold out for a complete season, or, continue to watch my bootleg versions of ALL the episodes"
4,I had forgotten how funny this series was!,"I hesitated before buying this series on DVD after hearing they had replaced the original music. I'm glad that I went ahead and made the purchase. I'd forgotten how funny the series was, and especially how much Gordon Jump (the Big Guy) contributed to it.Barring two instances, the changed music wasn't that jarring to my watching experience. Don't get me wrong, I truly wish the original songs were there, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment except when ""Hot Blooded"" was missing when Les was getting ready for his date, and the conversation between Mr. Carlson and Johnny Fever about Pink Floyd's song ""Dogs"" was missing. I wish they had spent the money for music rights to at least those two songs.But other than that, the comedy was still there! If you were a fan when this show was on the air, don't let the changed music keep you from enjoying the series again."
1,I also cancelled my pre-order,"I understand that all artists should get their ""fair share"" from this - but how greedy can people get?? The list price of this watered-down IN""Complete"" version is $39.95?? For that, you think they could have worked out their differences and produced something the fans actually want. I just got ""Maude"", uncut and nicely presented, for $22.95 - HELLO?? The original music was a key part of this show, especially in the closing credits. And lastly, the whole point of buying a series on DVD is to see the FULL, UNCUT, ORIGINAL shows. VERY disappointing."
4,WKRP is not THAT bad,"OK, I understand all the angst about the removal of the music from the show. Yes, it does take away from it, yet you need to understand that the music did not make WKRP what it is, it was the writing and the cast. From Les Nesman telling Venus that there ""..are a lot of negros in sports"" to Herb dressing up like a carp, the show's greatness is there, not in the music. The Thanksgiving Turkey drop, the concert with ""Scum of the Earth"" the on air drinking demonstration where Johnny never gets drunk and Venus is gone after two drinks, the DVD shows why WKRP is (next to Andy Griffith) the best sitcom of all time. I purchased the DVD after reading all the reviews about the music and am happy I took the chance. The show still stands out without the music and I hope that those of you who are considering this DVD give it some thought and make the buy."
1,WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!,Yes this show is great!!! But with that said.....I wanted to give this set a no star review but Amazon wouldnt let me!!!!!!This set stinks all the music is gone episodes are shorter ... should have read all the reviews ....now I own a Cr*ppy box set !!!SHAME ON YOU FOX!!!!!
1,Add me to the list of unhappy fans...,"Thanks to everyone for posting the reviews and saving me the trouble of placing a pre-order which I would just then have to cancel. Butchered scenes? Come on. This is a classic show that has plenty of fans willing to pay $$ for it on DVD, including me - spend the $$ and do it right. You won't get my sale. What a waste."
1,canceled!!,"I cannot believe I actually canceled my order for this since I own almost every Classic TV DVD but after reading scenes were cut out, I couldn't go through with it. As far as the music being cut. Some of the music is part of the plot, how do you cut that. What about the episode with the Russian trying to stay in this Country(a defector)...""Hold me closer Tiny Dancer"" Remember? What song could they put in it's place? Big disappointment!!"
2,Not authentic,"Of course you should expect authentic recipes from a book like this--why else would you want to buy it? If you follow Bruno's directions, you make a lousy deep dish that tastes like a hunk of bread with tomato sauce on it, not real Chicago deep dish pizza. I have duplicated Uno's, Giordano's, etc. at home and Bruno is way, way off the mark."
1,Don't waste your money,"I used several different brands and was the least happy with the Medela brand. After just 1-2 washes they were so wrinkled and misshapen that they were unusable as a breast pad. No, I did not use the little bag that came with them or hand wash, etc. I just threw them in with the rest of my little one's laundry. however, I tried 4 different brands and these are the only ones I had trouble with as far was washing and losing shape."
4,"some witty writing, though much is lost by time","This book is a collection of what appear to be dinner speeches by Simeon Ford over the years. The speeches are over 100 years old, and parts of them appear to have lost their wit due to the jokes and understandings of that age no longer being known. Others, however, are rather funny, and the author is quite good at using plays on words and double entendres to make his wry jokes. An enjoyable book overall, despite the parts that did not survive to be timeless."
3,Don't judge by the cover,"As a guy, I looked at the cover and though ""Boring girl stuff!"" But then I opened it and found for some parts I was right. BUT, I agree with the previous comment. I'm used to reading books with plotcs n stuff that are really long and have some sort of structure. Little did I know that Mandy's diary IS sort of like a story telling about all her happenings. Her poetry is really cool because she always surprises you at the end. Her short stories aren't half bad either. They have a cool twist in some of them. All in all, I thought it was a decent book. Yes, maybe something more for girls, but i enjoyed reading all the site updates. Being a web person myself I think that's another reason why I liked it. Web chicks are awesome!"
3,disappointed,"I know this magazine from Germany and love it, but it is not the whole magazine that came to the USA, parts are missing!"
2,It is supposed to hold 2 SD cards?,"Sturdy little case. Should have chosen something that had images of the inside. It was a gift for my father. He couldn't figure out how to get 2 SD cards in it, assuming they should be side by side. They will not fit side by side. Had to stack them? Run the risk of card falling out when opening."
2,GOOD at FIRST,"The idea of a self cleaning litter box is great especially when it shampoos and disposes the waste and dries the cat litter. But after a couple of use small parts of the waste get left behind in the litter box because the scoop doesn't do a great job and that left over waste gets washed and dried with the litter and you whole house ends up smelling like shampooed poop. It's disgusting.I have purchased this item about 2 months ago and I have recently found out that im pregnant and the smell of cat waste is very harmful to my fetus so I decided to return the item back to Amazon but they won't give me a full refund and are making me pay for shipping. Amazon you're loosing your touch. For those who are looking to but this item DON""T save your money and just keep looking for something better."
3,great at first but.... in a few months....,"You will love this product at first. But... in a few months it will start making a funny noise. Or perhaps have a terrible stenchy sewer smell that will not go away. You will call the company. They will tell you how do disassemble this product. Be prepared for the worst, most disgusting job of cleaning out a cat box you have ever done in your life! You will need a mask & eye protection. when I say gross I mean it! Funny the Cat Genie people & video's don't mention this. If they did... I really don't think anyone would buy it. The cat hair gets stuck around & on everything! & is covered with sewage. guess how it gets clean!!!!!! You take it all apart pry of the hair & sewage scrub it down & out it back together. Months of caked on raw sewage!"
1,Poorly designed and prone to failure resulting in worst case results,"Since buying this product I've had to clean out clogs 4 times. That is completely unacceptable and for the money this ranks with the worst purchase I've ever made. Had the company that put this out spent even the slightest bit of effort into tweaking the design this would have been perfect. But alas, it'll leave you cleaning up liquified waste at a regular interval depending upon how often it is flushed.I'd avoid this product completely if I had only known."
3,"Would be great, if only the cats would use it.","I received the Cat Genie. It had some operational issues, but the company is very easy to talk to and we were able to get it up and running. The problem is it's been a month and the cats won't use it. I have worked with the company to use all the tricks to make the cats use it, and they won't. Maybe you can't teach old cats new tricks! If they would this machine is slick and you truly would never have to scoop cat litter again! But it is too expensive to have just sitting there unused by the cats. Also if you buy this item at Amazon, you only have 30 days to return it. I may have been able to get the cats to use it if I had had more time. If you buy directly from Cat Genie, it will cost you more, but you have a full 90 days to work with. So keep that in mind when deciding where to buy it!"
2,Would NEVER own another one,"We bought our catgenie 6 months ago and so far we have replaced 2 motors, 1 bowl and the scooper arm. The only thing that we have NOT replaced is the base and I am sure that will be the next thing to go out. I have spent so much time on the phone with the technical support I am on a first name basis with Nora, the customer service representive. Customer support has been great. They always take the time to help me figure out what is wrong and they have sent out the replacement parts quickly. We have 3 cats, 2 of which spend at least a part of each day outside, so they should not over work the catgenie. However, I have to take the machine completely apart and work on it monthly because it is blowdrying cat feces. Which is a smell you cannot forget! I will say that when it works it is the best thing imaginable, but it does not work consistantly. For what it costs I would expect a much better built product. Thank God for a two year warranty!"
3,SCREW THE CAT GENIE!,"I bought this piece of crap last year. I promise in the beginning you will love it, it will make you wonder why you never bought one before. AND THEN, it does what mine has done and that would be completely break down and get full of crap, then your cat starts crapping and pissing everywhere else too!!! I've been calling the company that makes the cat genie and I have yet to get in contact with them. This piece of crap is expensive, real expensive. The granules (litter) is thirty bucks a box and it doesn't last long enough, neither does the cartridges, they're expensive as hell and honestly it's a waste of money. I wish someone would have wrote a review like this before I wasted my money on this piece of CRAP! My cat has been pissing all over thanks to this waste of money breaking down on me. Now I have to go buy ANOTHER litter box AND litter all over again. It's definately not worth the price."
3,"I wish it scared the poop out of my cat, not just scared him","I'm sure this product works great. Now if only my cat would use it. If I were granted one five-minute period where I could fluently communicate with my cat, I would use all of that time to explain to him why he should use this product. But alas, I cannot speak cat. He is set in his ways. Apparently this thing isn't even good enough for my cat to poop on."
1,Worthless,"This item is absolutely worthless. Whatever you do- do not purchase it.1. Random break downs2. Granuales get EVERYWHERE. Your cat is used to covering their own litter- the pebbles are kicked all over the place PLUS they cling to the cat's paws.3. Cumbersome in size4. Not easy to set up- we had to go to Home Depot to get various parts to make it work.5. DO NOT BUY THIS, especially from Amazon because returning it is impossible."
2,"Good idea, but...","I think this is a wonderful idea. However, my cats are older, 10 and up, and I still haven't convinced them in over a month that they want to use it. I am still fighting the good fight, but don't expect to just replace your old box one day and be done with it. In my opinion, CatGenie should consider some type of attractant to add to the litter that would not harm the product."
4,Very Handy,"I purchased this cat box because I have two healthy kittens and I didn't want to have to clean a litterbox all the time. It took my male kitten about a day and a half to start using it all the time. My female kitten would not use it for about a week. I would definitely get the side rails because they knock the litter everywhere and then track it into the house.I also would get the 120 model, as there have been some nice enhancements. I wanted to buy that model and actually thought I had (according to Amazon employee I spoke with), but I got the model 60 (original CatGenie) instead.The 60 does what it's supposed to and I'm happy with it.You have to make a decision, though, on what you value most: running it 3-4 times a day and not much, if any, smell; or conserving the solution (which will be used up very quickly) and running only two times a day and having some cat box smell throughout the day!If you want convenience in a litter box, buy this today. I think you will be happy you did!"
5,So Refreshing!,"I attended a conference at Heritage International Ministries (where Suzy often leads worship) in 2006. I heard some of these songs live, and I liked them, so I purchased the CD. My husband and I started playing it in the mornings to help us wake up. And what a wake-up it is! I have to confess I didn't like the whole album at first, but it really grew on me. Of course, as the other reviewer said, it's best to hear it live. BUT if you can't fly to the Carolinas every day, this is the next best thing. : ) The lyrics are so fresh and full of meaning. I'll be listening to this one for many years to come. **NOTE!*** Don't buy the remix album. It was disappointing."
5,Every church should teach a class based on this book,"Ken Sande provides an exciting vision of how God's covenant of peace can extend throughout the Christian community. Moreover, Ken's highly practical advice can help resolve conflicts in every family, church, school, workplace, and government. People who apply Ken's teachings will appreciate more fully why our Lord promises blessings to peacemakers. Every church should consider teaching classes based on Ken's book so that church members everywhere can more actively sow in peace and reap a harvest of righteousness."
4,Very Practical Application,"We are doing a group study of this book and the way it is written leads to very practial applications and discussions. As we use the techniques we are becoming better communicators, if not peacemakers. I am so glad I bought it and am using it."
5,Biblically sound and very practical,"Reading this with my then fiance was really helpful. The book is truly founded on the Bible, and the author relates scriptures in very practical ways. We use it often, and are buying the kindle version to have it on the go!"
5,fantastic,A Great read! I absolutely love books about bf's finding love and this one is the perfect example of how it's supposed to be done!
3,Still not secure,"I thought for sure that the third time was the charm for buying mailboxes. With the 90 degree angle on the door I thought it was tamper proof, until my wife stuck in her arm up to the elbow and picked up the piece of mail we had in it for testing purposes. I did see one similar online that featured a sawtooth pattern on the back of the door, I was thinking of sharpening this to a razor sharpness but the wife said no. ;^) Back to the drawing board."
2,poor cinematography,"Let me start this review by saying that I am not a dancer and have no ability to critique the dancing in this video. What is problematic is the cinematography. There are scenes shot from such a distance you can barely see what is happening on stage. Other scenes are so poorly lit, it is difficult to see what the dancers are doing."
5,personal,"Open His gift is so easy to read that an uneducated individual can understand the plan of salvation, and yet so powerful that our adult Sunday School Class spent last fall and winter studyingit.

3,AN ACADEMIC VIEW OF THE FUTURE,"is again presented by Daniel Bell, Stephen R Graubard and colleagues in 'Toward the Year 2000.' This ""work in progress"" was started in the 1965 by the Commission on the Year 2000 of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. It does not try to ""predict"" the future but rather to uncover and explore those social factor which will have a long term effect. The some 50 scholars contributing toward the study are mostly sociologists and historians with a liberal smattering of theoretical economists. They are not imaginative futurists, cultural creatives, or social activists so the chance of them being unbiased and perhaps right makes this an important resource for anyone seriously preparing for the future."
5,"Beautiful Sound Quality, Beautiful Price, Beautiful Music","I totally agree with the other reviewers and won't say more on the music contained on this CD - it is simply the most beautiful PURE solo guitar flamenco I have ever heard!I just wanted to comment and say that the sound quality on this CD is simply unbelievable. I am picky when it comes to sound, and own a 5,000+ pair of speakers. Whenever I want to show off my speakers capability to somebody, I put on this CD. The hand clapping, the guitar, and the clicking of the castanets are so incredibly rich in detail and vibrant in color that they often startle people who think there somebody is playing music in the room.It doesn't matter if you are new to flamenco, or a long-time fan - get this gem of a CD jam-packed with 80 minutes of ingenious flamenco guitar."
3,Good pair of scissors but not MADE IN CHINA!,"I specifically bought these scissors because I wanted to support American manufacturing as the description specifically states ""MADE IN USA"".They work great (can't deny that) but was displeased that these weren't Made in America.Dinged 2 stars for improper description Fiskars!"
3,Three great songs out of 9; but the 3 are truly great,"I disagree with some other reviewers. This is a good album, but most songs will NOT strike most listeners as enjoyable. On the other hand, three songs -- ""Love is the Drug"", ""Both Ends Burning"", and ""Just Another High"", are utter rock classics, meant to be played loud and screamed along with in the car."
4,Almost too basic,"This book is almost too basicc. I find myself skipping chapters because it starts as if the reader has never ridden a horse. Examples such as how to purchase a horse. Where to search for riding instructor. But, there are some good tips on how to prepare you and yourself for the trail. However the author doesn't explain how just what a rider should know."
2,Dragonball Z Series 16 Figure:SS Trunks,"The head fell off the figure and now needs to be glued on. It is not too durable for playing rough.Otherwise, the figure itself is ""pretty cool"" per my 7 year old son."
4,R.I.P. Blues Legend,"The blues community has recently lost many of its legends, including the great Little Milton Campbell, who made many recordings during his career. While `Feel It' doesn't add much to his discography, it is Milton doing what he does best, playing great soul-blues. Like most of his Malaco releases, the set list varies from straight blues (the two originals, ""I Gotta Get Away From You"", ""You're Giving Me the Blues"") soul (""Shot from the Saddle"", ""Born Yesterday"") and ballads (""Loveable Girl"", ""If You Give Me You're Heart""). There are a few surprises to, including the rique ""She Know How to Wear A Hat"" (rare for Milton to do a song like that). The last two songs are a bit of a risk for Milton (Patsy Cline's ""He's Got You"", Lionel Ritchie's ""Lady"") but he is able to pull them off.Little Milton left a large discography behind to remember him by. While `Feel It' doesn't rank near the top of his discography, it is still an enjoyable reminder of this true blues legend."
3,All New to Me,"I remember watching this show but I cant recall any particular episodes. The first 2 seasons are in my bookcase and for $20.97 the 3rd season will be joining me shortly. I will enjoy watching them again--I hope, that is why I gave it 3 stars."
4,The Seasons of a Fisherman,This book is written from the personal experiences of a life lived on and in the water. Haig Brown's love of fish is evident. Recommended for lovers of fish and their habitat.
4,Unforgetable Approach At Learning French,"Humorous and Educational Approach in French . There are phrases I may never use,but one day may find handy. The choice is there as to what I chose to learn and utilize. Thank you for the possibilities and the humor. People at the beach to this day are wondering what was so funny in your book.Especially a French instruction book.Learning is never dull ,nor need be, and either is this book."
5,Classic,"One of the best albums ever recorded. Great lyrics, great music. I'm so glad that this album is available again on CD by one of the best bands ever, and unfortunately one of the most underestimated as well."
1,Not what I expected...,"I did not like these boots... I am tall, 5'9"" or so and these boots were too big around the calves, even when I laced them tight it didn't work. Then when they are on they slouch majorly in the ankle area, it becomes really baggy. Also in just walking back and forth in the hall they rubbed on my heel and the side of my foot horribly. It is a great concept, but for me if I was going to wear them all the time like I wanted-because I am obsessed with knee high and over the knee boots-these are not up to par. Also they are about two inches at least below my knee.. So once again not what they say they are, they are more up to the calf boots. I just wasn't impressed at all, I was so excited and I just knew they would be perfect, but it was a major fail... I will be returning them. For those of you who get them, good luck! I really wanted them to work..."
4,an excellent staple in my wardrobe,the minnetonka boots have long been a staple in my wardrobe. I love how comfy they are and the superior quality in the crafting and materials. the best part: they have upgraded the sole to a non slip rubber sole with texture that is so much better!
3,Packaging leaks,"I ordered 4 boxes of litter and they all shipped in one larger box. Each of the 4 boxes leaked some of the litter during shipping. I think the litter packaging needs to be improved, especially considering the high cost of the litter. Adding an inner bag sealed with a twist-tie would resolve the issue."
2,new cat genie washable granules,"The new box of granules that I recently received looked a little bit different from previous boxes. The granules were darker in color and I keep having issues with ""clogging"". The ""clogged"" error has come up 3 times since I started using the new box and the only thing I see is granules in the hose."
2,You are going to need a few boxes a year,I hope you got your side walls and any spacer upgrades to keep in as many of these things as you can. they are not cheap and you will need to fill up every few weeks or more. if you can get them to stay in the bowl they seem to work as intended.
3,Cat Genie Washable Granules,I was disapointed in your advertisement. It led me to believe that when I put the number one in the order form that it meant that I would receive 3 boxes of product. That is why I just placed the number 3 in the order blank as I thought then I would receive 9 boxes of product. I have eight cats and now that I am using CatAttract (kitten) (regular) (long haired) & (seniors) the one cat that did use the CatGenie seldom uses it anymore. In a way I am glad I only received 3 boxes as at the present rate this will last me several years. If for some reason one or more of the cats decide to use the CatGenie then I will order more washables.
2,Be prepared to vacuum ALOT!!!,"These granules are so small that they get stuck between the pads of your cats feet. Then the cat spreads it onto your bed, all over the floors, on the sofa, down the length of the stairs, and around the house. BE PREPARED TO VACUUM ALOT! Petnovations needs to redesign these so they do not track like this. Either make them bigger or by some other method. These seem to be a work-in-progress that the customer is charged for as an experiment."
5,awesome alternative to clay or pine litter,"These granules work great! We have them on the monthly delivery option thru Amazon, alot cheaper too!!"
2,it'll spread throughout the house,"The cat genie itself has probably clogged up about once a month requiring complete disassembly and cleaning. I run it multiple times a day so that the system stays cleaner but this will only help so much. The ""granules"" for some reason spread all over the house! not cool always cleaning and vacuming them into the trash and having to buy a new box every other month!!!!!"
3,From Bad To Better,"I must sayWhen opening this cd, i was happy that i could add another Frankie Bones project to my collection. I absolutly love the man and his music :)So i press play on track 1, and EEEEEEEEEEEK!!This had to be the worst opening to a cd EVER! The first 4 or 5 tracks are HORRIBLE! Absolutly heartbreaking disgustingly horrible! It isn't till the 6th song that Frankie himself comes on and totally changes the pace the cd is going. He basically saves this cd from getting no stars at all! From track 6 and on, the cd keeps a decent tone to it and so, i give from tracks 6 through End : 3 stars... and tracks 1 through 5 : -20 stars!"
1,What's Hawaiian about it?,"Perhaps it was the misleading title, but I was very disappointed when, thinking I had purchased this CD for a Hawaiian music lover, heard the contents. Why not call it Original music that isn't traditionally Hawaiian from folks who live in Hawaii. Then I wouldn't have purchased it for a gift, gotten it back, had to call Amazon, receive a return authorization, send it back, etc."
1,worthless,"I bought this adapter in the hope that it would actually work. But no it is the worst product I have ever used for an intake adapter. None of the holes lined up, the square port adapter that comes with it is also the wrong size, and the quality of the piece is far from perfect. Rating out of 10 I would give it a 1."
4,"Nice watch, but it's big!","I got this watch for Christmas after putting it on my wish list. I wish I would have known how large it is however. I have small wrists, and this watch is too large for mine. It is well over 1/2 inch thick making it quite tall above my wrist. Had a jeweler take 4 links out so it fits around my wrist fine. Just wish it weren't so bulky. Pretty cool how it sets the time for you!"
4,Much Assembly Required,"Overall great product, but instructions were lacking. Two foriegn language instruction sheets were included in the package thus leading me take it all appart and reassemble. The base of the bed was very difficult to put together. Overall, It is a very sturdy and beautiful bed. My toddler loves it!! It just needed instruction in English for me."
3,Whats the hype about?,"I really don't understand why people find this album so mind-blowing. It is not all that heavy, and the vocals are pretty off base, with horrible lyrics as well. I realize that the main focus of the album is to be a guitar players wet dream, but I don't find the songs to be composed very well. There are many solos, and lots of arpeggios, and lots of skill involved here. I would recommend this album to people who also like me, enjoy wild guitar soloing. The truth is that the songs themselves are mostly not that good. I would give it a solid three stars, with a warning that you may find this album to lack taste when it comes to strong compositions. If your not bothered by this, and mostly just want to hear Suimez destroy the fretboard then by all means pick this up."
4,"It's Angel, What's Not To Like","Pretty good story. Moved at a decent pace, and held my interest, with the exception of the chapters with Wes in the mine. That didn't interest me in the least. Everything else I really enjoyed, especially Angel and Gunn out and about trying to save Wes. Loved the action. Recommend to all fans of the TV show."
4,Italian cook book,"My Mother told me of this cook book,so I bought her one too,we love Italian food.Great Cook Book."
5,Excellent - one of my favorites,This is by far one of my favorite ever cookbooks. Everything is delicious and easy to follow. I have A LOT of cookbooks and I always go back to this because the meal is guaranteed delicioso!!!
5,Deanna Damiano,This book is definative...easy to use...complete...compeling. It makes you want to knoe Lidia and cook with her. A must have for any serious Italian cook.
5,great recipes and my mother loves the book,My mother loves Lidia so I got this book for her. She loves the recipes and more.
4,Very nice,"The box/case looks very accurate. I give four stars because, there was no chain, rope included as it was captured on the picture."
3,Deceptive Photo,The case is too bulky for only 4 SD cards. I expected two cases. A large and a small. I would not have purchased this if I knew I was only getting the 4 SD case.
1,NO CLIP,"The case I received has no clip. Must be ""new and improved"" version.... Too bad because the case itself is nice, there's just no way to clip it to anything."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a very sturdy case and it's stayed closed for me so no concerns there, but when I open the case 1 of the slots is a bit looser then the others and the disk will come out of that slot on its own. Open slowly to ensure it doesn't fall out. Overall still good, happy I have it. 4 slots, 4 cards, all I need at this point so it works for my needs."
1,Disappointingly large,"I didn't expect this case to be almost 1/2"" thick. It uses up about the same volume as the 4 memory cards in 4 separate plastic cases. It does have a lot of padding, but I don't believe that SD cards are that sensitive to damage on being dropped. This case looks like you could drop it off the top of a tall building and your SD cards would still be OK. I'd like something slimmer in my pocket."
1,Not What I Was Looking For,"I have been told that the key to gluten free cooking is weights not measurements. This has to do with the fact that gluten free flours may be more or less dense than conventional flour. So I decided to purchase a kitchen scale. Since all the recipes that were tried and true with weights were in grams, I decided to find one that weighed in grams. I did not want an electronic version as I do try to be good to the environment. Upon reading the description for this scale I thought it was exactly what I wanted. If I want to weigh in kg it is perfect, but my recipe calls for 2 weights of 15g. I can only approximate. If I wanted to approximate I could use a measuring cup. I have sent this scale back. I see no practical use for it at all."
1,not worth its value...,"im an intermediate flamenco guitar player. i bought this book thinking it would add to my techniques and knowledge. IT DIDN'T. its written for BEGINNERS. and the price its valued at is way too high for the material presented. I've seen books incuding materials, both better in quality and quantity, yet are sold for half the price or slightly more. unless ur a beginner wanting to waste ur money... look for other books."
1,excellent idea - poor execution,"The main bar of the hitch hand is heavy steel, fitting into a 2"" receiver and with a socket welded to the other end. This socket receives a lighter guage steel T-bar into which go the side extensions. Unfortunately, the socket on the one I received was not welded straight - it was off enough that the T-bar, when attached, was off from level nearly 1 inch over its approx. 3' length. In addition, there were no instructions (assembly is intuitive enough, though), and the very torn cardboard packaging was inadequate for such a heavy item. The one I received new was scratched up and rusted in places. There is barely enough height adjustment to reach the bed height of a 2001 Chevy 1500 Z-71(not HD). This one gets returned."
5,Wonderful Work!,"This is an amazing book for anyone who is bisexual or just plain interested in gender studies. It is well written, informative and all encompassing when it comes to the many realms of sexuality outside the terms ""gay"" or ""straight"". Through reading this book I was able to realize that although I am a bisexual women, I often identify myself as a male gender phsycologically. That you Marjorie for this wonderful piece of literature!"
2,Mediocre at best.,Two great and gifted actors and very mediocre scripting. Actually the idea for the story line wasn't too bad. Just very poorly written and too predictable. The actors really never had an opportunity to act. A few good laughs. But the movie drug in several parts and believe it or not I had to get up and move around to stay awake. Somehow I think this story could have been much better protrayed. It just never connects. A great label does not a good wine make. No awards here.
4,Fun to watch again!,"I have seen this movie many times, and enjoyed it more each time - Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen are a very charming couple and work well together."
3,for richer or poorer,"The movies are fine, but I ordered two new movies and they weren't new. They were both opened and one had some small scratches on it."
4,Quiet Suspense,"Lisa Jackson is wont to surprise her readers as much as entertain. If you are anticipating typical Jackson jargon in this novel, well, you may be disappointred, as I was. I'm a Lisa Jackson fan so you'll fine no complaint from me, but I was a little surprised at the content of ""Whispers"" which found me trying hard to peice together the jist of this story, but typically, it all drew together as the last pages loomed and I again planned to buy more Lisa Jackson. Funny how some of your pre-conceived notions of an author slant your thinking until your come to the realization that it's just like you knew it would be. Read it and find yourself pleasantly suprised. I did. I'll be back at Amazon, my main source of Jackson books, very shortly."
1,"Skimpy, with errors as well","In short: too much English -- most of it irrelevant -- and not enough Deutsch. Also it has errors. In the Chapter ""The case of the Declining Noun"" we are told that most German nouns are pluralized by adding er to the end.I am just learning German and bought this book. A waste. I have found ""German How to Speak and Write It"" by Rosenberg a useful book."
4,Works for Me,"With this cable adapter I am able to charge my iPhone 5 and sync it with iTunes. Both connectors are slightly larger than the Apple ones. The build quality seems good, but time will tell. The cable is stiffer than the Apple original."
2,Not what I hoped for,I have to wiggle it to get it to work. I guess you get what you pay for. But a good price.
1,definatly not a Apple quality cord,"I bought this as a extra cord for travel as I travel quite a bit. The extra length is nice and the cable looks of good quality but I have had problems with the cord since the first time I used it. My Apple cord that came with the phone DOES NOT have any of the following problems that the new sync/charge cable does. The new cable cuts in and out of charging if the cord is moved, I recieve error messages saying that charging is not supported even though the phone shows its charging. When I put my phone on the charger for the night i need to know its will be fully charged in the morning as I dont have time to wiggle the wire and let it charge for a bit before I have to leave for the day.I have sent TWO emails to the sellers customer service and have had NO respoce from them. It is clear they do not stand behind their product and have no desire to replace the cable or refund the cost of the cable. I would not recomend this product."
2,The cable did not work.,"I plugged in the cable into my iPhone 5, and it displays the message ""this accessory does not support charging"".I repeated by unplugging and replugging constantly getting the same message."
4,Nice Cable,I needed extra cables for my wife and I. These have done the job perfectly. The only issue is that they do not click into place like the OEM cable.
1,chow can you give less than a star?!?!?!?!,"A product is only worth something if it works- or if it is replaced promptly. Neither has happened with this product. It didn't work a bit when I got it, and I still haven't gotten a replacement as promised. Do yourself a favor- buy the apple cord and save yourself the aggravation."
1,Wrong item ordered,Was sent wrong item and can't exchange it. Tried multiple times and says contact customer service unsuccessful! First time disappointed.
3,Plug a bit to tight,For a back-up cable this works fine but the Lightning connector is a little too tight for my liking.I guess I'm just used to the high quality and smoothness of Apple's products so I worry this my cause undo wear on the iPhone Lightning connector.
1,Did not work for me,"I wanted a spare cord for charging in my car and after reading the reviews I thought this cord would be fine.When I first plugged it into my car adapter, I heard the phone begin to charge, but it wouldn't hold. Tried a number of times, but it would not connect. The fit is very tight into phone. Also the plastic sleeve/collar around the pin came loose. It did not work at my computer either. Sending it back today."
3,It works but,"It works but it does not connect to the device right away, you need to adjust and re adjust until the connection is lock, unlike the one provided by apple that it connect spontaneously on first try."
4,Works as expected,Charges and syncs just like the cable the iPhone 5 came with. Only differences are lightning connector end is larger and it has a snugger fit. 4 stars for functioning correctly. 1 star taken off for the snug fit and larger lightning end. I would buy another.
4,A little snug...but it works.,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a little snug. The fit doesn't seem to be tight enough to damage the port, though. Decent alternative to the (much pricier) apple cable."
3,So-so,"You get what you paid for.The cable connects to my laptop, recognized my iPhone, and can charge it.However, my computer cannot sync through this cable.I'll just use it for recharging.Okay-price, okay product."
5,Works great,"I have used this for my iPhone 5 and iPad 4. Works great. Didn't notice a ""snug"" fit as other reviewers suggested."
1,"Worked, for about 3 weeks...","Bought this cable on 12/28/12, like others was hesitant to buy a non-OEM cable. It worked for me for bout 3 weeks before it started constantly flaking out when trying to sync to my laptop. Relegated cable to charging iPhone in the car which it did for about another week before completely failing. Lesson learned and will be forking over the extra $$ for the real cable."
3,"Good overall, but some problems...","Farrelly creates interaction between teenagers very realistically at times, but other characters, specifically the father, seem less so. It is had to imagine a maturing teenager tolerating being called ""Dildo"" by his own father. At times, the father appears down right cruel and very ignorant (and not very believable). Of course, Tim, the main character, must overcome his father's glaring callousness and the arrogance of his rich friends at his private school. But this does not seem to ever occur. Instead, Tim leaves the school still bitter about his experience and of course must go back home now to -- guess who? -- his father who he dubiously loves. Farrelly's prose saves this novel; he can write with question, but he surely should have considered some of the weaknesses in his plot."
1,Yuck!,"... This is great. Everything you need to to learn about the Old Religion and the tools to do the Craft. I take the Goddess coin with me everywhere i go as it is a very powerful tool. So don't listen to those lesser witches, take it from me, this is ALL you need to be highly successful in magick.For one thing, having a different opinion than you doesn't mean they are ""lesser witches"" ... This kit implies that tools make the craft. They don't. ..."
5,excellent,"this kit is great for those who are just staring withchcraft and cannot afford the expensive tools needed to make it in the craft. i kit itself can be used or it can be used with her book teen witch. i wish that it had been around when i needed. enjoy, merry meet and merry part until we merry meet againMerlyn-Nevada"
1,You've gotta be kidding me!,"I'm a 16 year old practicing Wiccan/Witch, and I have been for 5 years. I've been blessed with an understanding though flawed mother who bought me the HORRIBLE Teen Witch book as the first one I ever owned (I forgave her, for we promptly took it BACK to the store for a full refund!). One would think that $ilver would have realized her mistake with the book, but now she comes out with a cheap kit? Does she think that she's just playing a game? WHAT IS THIS? Thank Goddess I never spent my money on this (...); I can and have made better items with my own two hands and a bit of imagination! I recommend that for any serious practitioner. This kit is a joke!"
1,Horrid!,"This whole thing is an insult to the Pagan community! I am truely outraged! A plastic pentical, a fold up cardboard altar?! I hate to cuss but, Mrs. RavenWolf is acting like a true warlock by putting this out! If anyone who is reading this has half a brain they're figure out this is pure B.S. and nothing more, maybe something less! One of my friend's, sister has this, the book tells almost nothing about the faith, and has more spells then information! Never buy this."
2,I feel degraded by this kit,"Ok , first off , as a serious teen Witch I find this kit very offending! How can a teen that buys this kit be respected by other teen witches? Even better, how can you expect to be taken seriously by Wiccan elders if you wear the cheesy pentagram offered in the box! In my opinion, you can get all the ""supplies"" included in this...card box thing, for under the retail price of the Kit.About the card box altar... how the heck are you supposed to light a candle on a card board box without burning down your house!?This kit would be good for initiating your young child (between 5-10 yrs of age! Not a teen!) to your practices, but besides that , buying this Teen Witch kit is like setting fire to a 20 dollard bill."
1,Let me jump on the band wagon,"Having read the many reviews here that trash this kit, let me tell you that there is very little I disagree with in those reviews. Although a few of them were down right nasty and over the top.Now don't get me wrong, I would never recomend this to anyone too old to play with barbie dolls but I do see the need for such tripe in popular culture, which is the only place I'd bet it sells.Frankly, I wish the author well with her future commercial efforts. Things like this are fun in the mass market, but I am a bit insulted that it is marketed within the Wiccan community."
2,Spoonfeed Your Teen Witch 101,"PART - A MAJOR PART - of being a witch involves learning to make and bless tools yourself. Sure, telling someone ""just use your imagination"" is similar to telling a 2 month old to perform brain surgery. I don't care ""how loving"" a religion Wicca is, they are reasons for using altars, rituals; and the making and consecrating of your OWN tools.Maybe Mama Silver blessed these items with money-drawing power.I fear for the next generation of Wiccans. If (and hopefully when) they find a seasoned practitioner/believer, they will not use this ""kit"" to try to impress the elders. The Kit-users will probably have their Ravenwolf-blessed crystals handed back to them with some rather curt words.I've been a Wiccan for thirty years (first ten solitary) and survived fabulously without a ""Get Witch Quick Kit""."
1,"No way, not at all.","$ilver Ravenwolf can not stop, and that is bad for those who are interested in Wicca. As I wrote in my review of Silver Broomstick, she writes not to entertain or inform, but for the $ilver she is named after.She already sanitizes Wicca to remove anything that might offend anybody with the slightest sentisitivities. That leaves fluff and light without substance, sugary, and much cuteness without anything beyond it, like a Fluffy Bunny.Then she abandons even the ethics her ""blockbuster"" trilogy managed to keep, when she wrote Teen Witch, which is nothing more than a spell book. No theology or ethics, even the sugary and watered down version she gave before. There really is nothing in the book.Now, get it while it's hot, get it here, an actual kit that will make you a witch. Extra Extra, you want fries with that witch kit? We got your pentagrams right here! No work, you're an instant Witch just because you bought this box.No, it doesn't work that way."
1,Don't even buy it if you want to burn it!,"This is the most pathetic thing I have ever seen marketed under the word Witchcraft. The book gives you spells to distract your bus driver but claims you should take the thing seriousely. The cardboard and plastic box doubles as an altar?I find this kit to be of absolutely no value to anyone other than the people who will probably make money off of it. Their is almost no mention of religion and the instructions on spellcraft are so cute, it should have been made by the people who made those little toy ovens that use a light bulb to make cake."
1,Silver FluffyBunny,"I am sooooooooo disappointed in Silver RavenWolf. When I was just starting out in the Craft, ""To Ride A SilverBroomstick"" was my Bible. Now, looking on her ""Teen Witch"" book, I realize how far a very good author has fallen. When I have children I MIGHT lead them to this book, but I DOUBT IT, since there are other books related to young kids that will suit better. The way she talks down to teens is very demeaning, and I also don't like the way she fills half the book with spells without further explaining the tenents of the religion. ""Hey, forget about that boring belief stuff, try some spells!!!"" Riiiiiight. All you teen seekers, go for Scott Cunningham and Jennifer Hunter, or even Silver's first book, ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"". Otherwise? Don't waste your time on this one."
4,Protection stops me from buying,"The c.d. would be well worth the money if not for the copyright protection. The last c.d. I bought that had the much hated protection would not play in my Chevy Colorado c.d. player. And I might add, the stereo system was standard, I did not take out the system and upgrade. Now, why, pray tell, would I buy a c.d. that may or may not play in my vehicle? The last c.d. (Joss Stone) played fine in the Toyota Tundra but it sounded like a scratchy 45 in the Colorado. It popped, skipped, and basically sounded terrible. While I understand (I guess) the rational behind copyright protection I do not understand why anyone would think that the average person would spend money on a c.d. and hope against hope that it would play. Sorry Mr. Cagle, I would like to purchase the c.d. but not when the chances of it playing are slim to none."
2,Decent CD but not worth the trouble,"All in all, I enjoyed the CD as far as the vocals and songs but the content protection is terrible. I could not get it to save onto my computer and play. When I tried it ended up crashing the whole system, and when you play it back it sounds grabled and scratchy. They say this helps protect the software but I was just downloading it to my computer for the first time and it still did not work. Be wary of these content protection unless you just want to listen to the CD in your car or stero, otherwise they are useless. I am extremely disappointed by not being able to copy the CD to my computer."
1,COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKSSSS!!!,I love the songs but I am PISSED!!! I have spent HOURS trying to get the cd into my itunes and now I am ready to break it into a million pieces and SCREAM!!! I paid good money for a cd that is completely USELESS to me. I want the music but on principle I will not download it...the record company does not deserve my business after the evening I have had. Not only that but now the cd cannot be enjoyed by someone else (i.e. recycled) when the original purchaser is ready to pass it on because it does not even work when new so pretty much these cds are just garbage someone needs to be slapped for coming up with this idea.
5,This is SWEET!,I loved this video! It showed me alot more than I knew about Cardcaptor Sakura than i did before and i love the one when she faces the illusion card! that one really got to me:_-) there were also some profanity but i can see why they used it. there was a ton of battle costume that were spectacularly drawn and i love kero's check at the end of each episode! can't wait for the new one to come out g2g!
3,Strong's CD rom,"I was amazed at the price for this great concordance. It was advertised with a CD rom included. There is an envelope for a disc, however the disc was not present. Also indicated was a new product, with no visible prior use, but had no cellophane or wrapping, which could allow disc to be no longer with the book. I cannot really complain though....The BIG book was only a few bucks. and well worth the price. I would still recommend this book for your bible study library.Roger"
2,Strong's Concordance,"The book is very old and used. I expected a better copy than I received. It is still useable. Since it is a reference tool, I am happy with the content but the outside cover is really beat up."
2,"Strong's Exhaustive Concordance, Complete and Unabridged","It is very comprehensive, very good. Won't need any other book for references. But, the one thing wrong with it, by me, is that I did not have large print.!! Must use a magnifying glass to read the small print. Do not know if there was one with large print?Or otherwise that is what I would have asked for!Thank you. Vera"
5,great,exceeded my expectations and great arrival time the concordance was in great condition and the purchase price remarkable im am very pleased what a blessing
3,"OK, but disappointing","I really wanted to like this book. The first chapter was pretty good. However, in the second chapter the author starts talking about spanking. It is hard for me to take parenting advice from someone who physically hurts their kids intentionally. This author needs to read Supernanny's book."
5,Don't Make Me Count To Three,"I loved ""Shepherding A Child's Heart"" by Tedd Tripp. After reading it however, I was left thinking, ""That was awesome but where do I go from here?"" Ginger Plowman's book goes hand in hand with Tedd Tripp's. She gives practical wisdom that is easy to apply and really helps in the ""training"" of your children. It also helped to point out bad habbits and areas of laziness in my own training."
1,a license for abuse should not be tolerated,"child abuse is already too prevalent in todays' society, we do not need any more episodes or anyone advocating and giving license to such dreadful acts."
1,If only i could give it zero stars,Disgusting book written by someone who must really loathe children. Unless you want justification for child abuse do not buy this book.
1,even the title is THREATENING,"do we want to teach children respect, we most model it. do we want to teach children to think, and provide an enviroment for whihc they can feel safe and secure in asking questions, making errors, challegning etc?- or do we want to conditon them to listen to one in power over them... do you want to raise a follower or a leader.... do you want to raise a healthy secure productive adult - not by reading this book, do you want to raise an insecure, anxiety ridden, rigid perfectionist?-- Then this book may be for you! I guess it would depend on how you were raised... but it truly never is too late for a happy childhood!-- though reading this book will not help"
3,"Green, clean smelling .... musk?","I expected a true musk, but this is more green and woody than any ""musk"" I've ever smelled. I've been using it as deodorant because it smells like soap on me. Not a stellar perfume, but I don't hate it."
3,Not as impressed,"I honestly thought this would be a ""Bible"" given her influence in the industry. This is better suited to someone with the business already started. For a better start up guide try Shirley George Frazier. However, This book spent a considerable amount of time on customer service, appearance and marketing. Not enough of the basic how to's."
5,PNYC DVD Rules....,"I already owned the VHS tape... but when I saw the extra content that was offered on this DVD I had to buy it. BEAUTIFULLY DONE and worth it at twice the price. Dolby 5.1 audio, cool menus, and material unreleased in the U.S. and of course, then there's the MUSIC."
5,Tales from the Ghosts,"I agree with all the other reviews. Michelle Whitedove captivates the reader with her bewitching tales of magical ruins, eerie hauntings and mankinds acts of inhumanities. She makes you feel like you were right there with her in the mists of all the intrigue and mystery."
1,An insult to Apollo,The clock ran without trouble for about 2 weeks. It then went dead. I purchased 2 new batteries(which cost $1.79 + tax each at Circuit City)and it ran for 1 day and died again. Don't waste your money on this clock.
3,different size - different mold,"I bought a size 14 first and it was molded larger than an average size 14 boot but very easy to get onto my foot at the ankle part of the boot. I then ordered a size 13 to see if it felt any better. Well first of all the boot had a different pattern on the rubber itself than the size 14 boot. Also it was very hard to get my foot into it because it was mold much, much, smaller at the ankle area. Although both boots are stamped with the tingley brand name, it seems as though they may have not come from the same factory due to the different mold pattern on the toe of the boot, and the different boot removal lug on the back of the heal."
5,The PERFECT boots for yardwork!,"Can't find Wellies? If not, these boots are the PERFECT compromise. The shipping was super fast. The quality was better than expected and they were true to size. The price is a ""deal"" and the boots are perfect for yardwork. VERY pleased!"
3,"Not like the picture, boots won't stand up","Although these boots are correctly sized and waterproof, they are floppy. This means unlike higher quality boots, you can't just step into them, but must hold them open to put them on. I got them for my husband to put on when popping outside as he always slips on his work shoes (fastest to put on) and they get muddy. Given these are not easy-on I think he will still put his slip-on work shoes on and not use these. If you're looking for inexpensive rubber boots these still make work fine for you."
4,Cute fairy cottage,"I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and it was a big hit. She loves the little characters and carries them around the house. I also liked that it was a little bit of a different theme than some of the other dollhouses out there. It is very nice for a little one, with chunky characters and furniture and the doorbell on the cottage is especially cute. The only reason that I don't give it all 5 stars is the fact that I wish there were a little more inside the house, to give the fairies more to do in there. But my daughter loves the little slide and I have to admit, the little catepillar is adorable! The handle breaks off the top of our house from time to time, but it is pretty easy to snap back on. All in all, a nice toy and a good purchase."
2,Black & White filmmaking ...,"Oversimplified, but entertaining attempt at capturing the history of the rise of the Black Panthers. The film is overblown and obvious in its depiction of the events leading to the group's downfall (and more than slightly racist in its depiction of every single caucasian portrayed in the film.) Its a shame, because some of the performances are quite good. Peebles really missed his chance here to make a definitive, grand statement about the Black Panthers. The film goes for all kinds of conspiracy theories (like Oliver Stone's ""JFK""), but is dilluted significantly by dumbed-down dialogue and schmaltzy music that is completely out of place. A disappointment."
4,Great,"Outstanding everything I expected. I am ok with stuff, but not an expert this was easy to use and great picture. Only problem did not know that I had to have firewire to get it on computer. Once I got a port it gets great pictures. Only reason I did not give it a 5."
4,Sony DCR-HC38 Review,"Great value, easy to use. Good quality video, can't beat the 40X and features. I would recommend this camcorder to anyone looking for a quality, easy to use product on a low budget. But don't be fooled by the price, this camcorder has a better quality picture than my JVC that I paid $700.00 for three years ago."
3,LCD Blows out,"I have an HC32 camcorder and my LCD display just died without much notice (it flickered one day and became dark with red hue and died). I searched the problem and it appears that a lot of people have shared a similar story on the net. It happened to my when my camera was about two years old. Similar problems have been reported on HC42 model as well. You may want to research this problem. I am not going to buy another SONY camcorder (it was my 3rd Sony Camcorder in 17 years...one of them still works). I was very happy with it till it worked. But, the LCD problem appears to be a widespread problem. Once the LCD display dies, you can't do much as most of the controls are through the touch screen."
1,down with the puppets,"The puppets in some of these dvds are just terrible. My son hates them as much as I do.To everyone with Caillou loving children, I recommend doing what I have done before I buy any Caillou dvd- go to your local library and checkout any Caillou dvds they have to check for puppets before you invest!"
1,Great BUT ONLY 22 MINUTES!!,This would be an excellent show - if it wasn't 22 minutes! Wait for iTunes to get this and download it for a dollar - It is definitely not worth buying the dvd!
1,"IT IS A JOKE, NO WAY IS LIKE CORRECTOL OR SIMILAR","the pill are like fun candy, they do not have the action of the rose pill you get in the farmacy, don buy it, does not work like the others"
1,Rip off,"My cheap Oster blender that cost $29.95 on sale far outlasted and outperformed this blender. The polycarbonate pitcher cracked after about a year of sporadic use--and mostly to puree soups. When I contacted customer service, they said that they discontinued this model and have no replacement parts. For that money, buy a KitchenAid--their customer service is excellent and you can buy spare parts even for an old model--and they stand behind their product."
2,Jar Cracked after 2 years use,"I purchased this blender from Williams-Sonoma 2 years ago. I am a raw vegan so I do lots of blending...pretty much daily. I have been pretty happy with this blender overall, but I noticed a few months ago that the jar was cracking on all 4 sides. In the past few days now, its actually leaking through the cracks. Today I called Villaware and they said if I ship the entire unit (base and cracked jar) they will replace it free of charge. I am ok with that since hopefully I get another 2 years of blending out of my initial purchase, but obviously once my replacement jar cracks again, I will definitely choose another make/model. I also noticed on Villaware website that they currently don't offer any blenders in their product line. Hopefully they are working on redesigning this one!"
4,Great for kids -- Elmo keeps getting better,"The people at Sesame Street seem to keep improving the quality of their Elmo shows. The songs and routines are imaginitive, and certainly keep the attention of my two-year-old. He's addicted to Elmo, so that's the best indicator of success.This edition focuses on things of wonder all around us, e.g., sky, moon, etc."
2,MisleadingTitle,"I bought this book as a refresher. The author goes through the material very quickly. His writing isn't very clear and I'm frustrated by the format of the book -- too much text, not enough examples or summaries. I'm sticking to my old college textbook."
1,TOO MUCH IS ENOUGH!,"As I write this, Amazon shows six different version of this very same title. Throw in a 1998 Canadian version (that I own) that deletes one song from the original LP and that brings the count to seven.Apparently, any label can reissue this album as long as they vary the track selection slightly.Folks, these are the same demo tracks (more or less) that have been circulating since 1977 from the days when the boys were kicking around Philly trying to score a record deal. By demo standards they are pretty good but no remastering job in the world will make them into something that they are not. I'd be willing to wager that the artists aren't seeing a penny off of any of these sales.Now, look at what the original vinyl is selling for, I'll wait...less than a buck. Even H&O; completists wouldn't touch these reissues with a 10 foot pole. Don't you either. There oughta be a law!"
3,Convenient for weekend getaways,"This is very convenient for weekend getaways or just being able to sleep in! The timers allow up to 48 hours. My cat didn't have a problem with it the first couple of times, but now he doesn't really eat food from the second container that opens, at 48 hours. There is an ice pack, but I can't imagine that it stays cold long enough for it to be effective on the second tray."
4,Quality Product. Some fine tuning of fitment required.,"Love the look of these now that they're installed on my truck. The front ones went on with very little hassle, the rears required some filing to fit the body lines of the box."
4,"Looks great, and was EASY to install - BUT..........","I would have given a perfect 5 star rating but of the HUGE time consumption of installing the ""COSMETIC"" bolts. There are like 30 bolts that you have to attach to the fender which are just for cosmetic purposes. It makes it look nicer, but you have to sit your butt down and fasten all of them. Then you have to put the rubber trim on. It took me 3x longer to setup the bolts and apply the rubber trim then it took me to actually install them onto the truck. So, just expect to spend over an hour setting up.The other issue is that if you own the Diesel, the CUMINS DIESEL logo is in the way. I was able to use a plastic tool to gently remove the logo. I went ahead and purchased new logo's because the old ones were a bit aged any way. Just be aware of that, as the logos cost about 20-30 bucks each, and there are two of them.Looks awesome."
3,Wrong cable - no ferrite cores as pictured,"Do NOT purchase this if you want one with ferrite cores installed, like the picture shows (as I write this). I wanted a firewire cable with ferrite cores installed and stupidly assumed the picture shown was what I was ordering. It wasn't. It's still a decent price and I'm sure it works just as fine as the regular firewire cables I already have, but it's NOT what I thought I ordered."
5,The Very Best of Bert Kaempfert,"Listening to this album, especially ""Wonderland By Night"", I find it easy to transport my musical spirit to a trendy German nightclub circa 1961. I have owned recordings by Bert Kaempfert in one form or another for over 40 years. I've always kept them close.My love for Kaempfert's orchestra started when I heard ""A Swingin' Safari"" in the early 1960's on KENI-AM in Anchorage, Alaska. It was my first Bert Kaempfert album. Next was ""That Happy Feeling"" and ""Afrikaan Beat."" This music can instantly brighten and lighten your mood.The best of the best, of course, are ""Wonderland by Night,"" ""Moon Over Naples,"" ""Danke Schoen"" and ""Magic Trumpet"". Kaempfert was unique in his use of the jazzy sound of bright twin trumpets (""Bye Bye Blues"") and barking saxaphones (""Strangers in the Night"").This album really is the very best of Bert Kaempfert and should be in the collection of any lover of jazz."
5,I Love THIS MOVIE its Defiantly a Classic,"This movie is classic,you have to have this movie in your movie collection you can watch it whith your ladies or cuddled up with someone"
4,Rosie O'Grady DVD,"Glad this movie finally came out in dvd. The dvd has the movie in good quality. Too bad this movie hasn't been colorized, cause it would be wonderful with color."
2,Chemical Process safety fundamentals,"This book could definitely have used more examples with many practice problems. instead it had plenty of questions with assignment problems. no answers provided in the back of the book; therfore, there was no way to check your work. the book was well organized and definitely engineering related. not an easy subject."
5,A paradigm shifting read,"This book tempted me with its description, treating love as a psychosis, and I wasn't disappointed. While I wasn't entirely convinced to relinquish my belief in what the author would probably call ""whismiscal"" love, I was both entertained and enlightened by this well researched and eloquently written book. I look forward to reading future non-fiction titles from this author."
5,Common Joy II,"Almost the same book as Common Joy. It is a very nice book about sculpture in the city of Madison, WI"
2,Dangerous product,"Like a previous reviewer, the handle(s) on my crock pot totally disintigrated. Luckily, I was just lifting it from the counter and did not get burned. I contacted Euro Pro and they are willing to send me a replacement, but they do not have a different model with the same 7qt capacity. I for sure won't be traveling with this one and once it gets put down somewhere, I am not moving it. Not the greatest solution, but I guess acceptable. They would in no way acknowledge that this is a hazard to people, even though I pointed out that I had read other reviews on line where the handles fell off."
4,Helpful for the price,"While this is a Haynes manual, not an in in-depth repair manual it is inexpensive and a time saver, especially if this is your first run at one of the featured engines. It lets you know what your getting into before you start...you can estimate your time. It includes many wiring diagrams and identifies many parts and things that you could figure out on your own, but it might take you a while. Although it is not an in-depth injection pump repair manual-""refer to a professional repair shop"" there are many quirky tips like the factory tools for setting things up. Once you see the drawings, you can rig up your own. So the book is cheap, it will save you some time and is worth having on your shelf."
2,Cliched and Painfully Slow.,"I realize that I stand fully in the minority of raters here with my opinion, but I found this film to be intolerably slow moving and featuring characters who were too clichéd to be believed. The dialogue was very stilted with the talented Dreyfuss and Hoskins coming off as caricatures as opposed to people. There's little risqué about this picture today, and very little that is of interest. No great human truths are illuminated or even alluded to. Overall, I was highly disappointed."
3,"Good Plan, weak on implementation","I agree with the other reviews, it describes benifits but no explicit method for the beginner. I think he tries to make it easy for Westerners but it seems like a rehash of what you can find in some Eastern text, I prefer listening to Alan Watts lectures and books, much more interesting and direct.Listening to Alan Watts, you can understand the Source as the Tao, or the Way, or natural law/flow of the universe and how to let go of your ego (which often opposes the Tao), observe the world, including your internal thoughts and emotions as background noise, without prejudgement of how things are supposed to be, and to experience this true reality (""source"") without the illusion of being a ""self"" in a artifical boundary called our skin, it extends beyond that. Then you will be awakened to great new things."
5,www.valderbeebeshow.com,"The Power of Intention (AUDIO CD) by Wayne W. Dyer - Hay HouseReleased in 2004, The Power of Intention demonstrates that the principle of intention (which is an energy) is timeless metaphysics. Wayne Dyer brings forth information for us to see intention in a new way, for intention to be used as an energy of creation, wealth and abundance. Explore The Power of Intention. Dyer is POWERFUL as he offers this principle to be seen and used in a different way: ""Change the way you look at things and the things you look at will change."""
1,Sounds like someone else jumped on the LOA wagon..,"I haven't read the book and not going to. From just reading some of the reviews you can already get a good idea how the book portrayed itself. You get the feeling Dyer just wanted to add a few more digits to his bank account. Based on his popularity, why not?If your going to read about these laws, then read of Emerson and his comrades on Transcendentalism. THose fellas put it in clear concise form without gummi bears to give the book flavor."
1,Bad recording,Disk one would repeat at various times and not continue. I consider it defective. Can it be returned?
3,Wayne Dyer Not Quite There Yet,"Genuine Mystics, or those who've reached a higher level of consciousness, do not find it necessary to prop up their false selves (ego) with titles (Doctor).However, there's worthwhile information in this book, even if it's in support of ideas you've already read or heard. Repetition, from different sources, aids those on the path of enlightenment.Wayne espouses service to others which is an ego based activitity that, from a higher level of consciousness, harms those you're helping. Get out of peoples way and let them hit bottom so they can find the spiritual path to truth. If every individual practices on raising their own level of consciousness there will be no one left to help.Wayne Dyer is heading in the right direction however his books are still written partly from the ego. If you want to read an easy to understand, common sense mystic, try Vernon Howard."
2,Important if True,"For me, the book does not read nearly as well as the associated promotional literature. Much of the book seems to me or strikes me as a plenitude of powerless platitudes. It all seems that it should be very nice if it actually works. For some person who somehow gets it to work properly, I'm sure it would be life-changing and very important. My own experience doesn't suggest very well how it actually could work---at all. If the book were actually as good as its promotional literature...."
2,"Mediocre, Like Dyer Himself","I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books."
1,New Age Crap,"This book is nothing but new age (...). Everyone nowadays is looking for something to fullfill this emptiness they have in their life. Everyone has it, but you just don't know how to fill it. Thus, everyone is searching for something. This is just another new age crock to attempt to fill that void. Why not just embrace the only thing that will fill that void - a saving relationship with Jesus. He is the only way you will fill that void. Everyone wants to fill it, but they are so afraid of filling it with Jesus. Don't buy into this stuff - it's non-sense."
1,No New Age,"I purchased the book because of a recommendation from a friend. I had never read any books by Dyer and was only remotely familiar with him through channel surfing. So I did feel that I was fairly unbiased before reading the book. Came away with the sense that the author is very, very, new age which puts many of his beliefs at odds with my own. I do not believe that I have to agree with everything an author writes, but from my perspective the book offered little help other than reinforcing my own beliefs. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,A must for everyone striving to reach the next level.,"I was bored one afternoon and switched on the TV. I saw Wayne's familiar face and heard his wonderful voice. This caught my attention and I watched the entire show for the next 2 hours. Impulsively I ordered the entire set (including the DVD, audio CD and the meditation books and CD).These promptly arrived a few days later. Both I and my wife thoroughly enjoy watching the DVDs when we are at home together. The book is very powerful as well. I have been a great fan of Wayne this has been one of his best works. ""You'll see it when you believe it"" being my all-time favorite."
5,"First rate writing, singing, influences and performance.","This was my intro to Graham Parsons. I did not know what to expect. I find this CD to be more country than country-rock. I believe Graham relied a great deal on country influences and captures them quite well. There is lots of pedal-steel, violin, harmonizing with Emmylou Harris (which right there makes it worth the price), and songs of regret, lost love, foolish behavior and the like. As another reviewer put it, this music will make you want to hurl whenever you hear stuff by those new country stars. In fact, it will increase your appetite for for those fundamental sounds that drove Graham Parsons to make music like this in the first place. For all you boomers out there who did not know this (as I didn't), Graham Parsons originally did the song Love Hurts - you know, that rock anthem done by Nazereth back in 1975 or so. The things you learn."
3,Spastic,"These guys are a bunch of spazzes. Song #1, #2 are great songs, and so is Ole Black n Blue Eyes, the last track. In between it just sounds all the same and it gets tiresome real quick. One star for each of the great songs."
2,Never Buy a CD off a Commercial,Oh that never works. Flathead is a fine song that holds up beyond the 30 second soundbite. The rest of the CD just doesn't go anywhere and is fairly repetitive. Flathead is also the most orginal song on the CD- lyrically and musically. The Fratellas sound like a good local bar band no more no less
1,I don't usually write reviews ...,"This product does indeed let you make wi-fi Skype calls. BUT, there are many problems. Probably the biggest is the fact that you can only talk for 20 minutes before the battery dies. In addition the screen is very slow to respond to keyboard inputs. This phone in no way lives up to the expectations created by comparably priced cell phones. Skype should not have endorsed this piece of technology."
1,Quite Useless,"I bought this 802.11G Wireless Skype Phone thinking that I can extend the use of Skype from my home to the many external location which offer WiFi. However, I don't seem to connect from this phone to ANY of the free WiFi networks and the keypad if quite difficult to type your Skype unserID and password when I did connect. The phone is a complete waste since I cannot even use it at home. I am now going to have by a wireless Skype phone for home use."
3,"Hair Today, Tomorrow Deadly Weapons...","It is silly with both parts of the tape taken up to fully tell the story. A couple of bald guys who have heads that look like food, want a magical hair that ranma wears on his pigtail for hair! Ranma of course fights for it in classic Ranma style with even Happosai and his father getting into the act. If you're looking for a Ranma tape that has it all, comedy, lots of fighting, chases, transformation and food, then get this video."
5,Wow!,"This is the first anthology I got years ago that made me say, Wow! Includes Sappho, Rabia, Yeshe Tsogyel, Hildegard of Bingen, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch of Antwerp, Lal Ded, Mirabai, Bibi Hayati, Tsvetaeva. The best collection I've found of women's voices in sacred poetry."
5,Don`t leave Lee`s Ferry without it.,Provides an excellent sequence of maps useful to people running the river plus considerable background info on notable past river runners. Published on water resistant material. Very useful!
4,The Song Remebers When....,I can't wait to share the thoughts captured in this book by Al and Donna with my firends and soul-mates. Music truly reminds us the and in our lives.
5,a must have!!,You will need this extra base!! I ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have. The day after it arrived my mother-in-law was sick and couldn't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up. I had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened.
3,Does not work with snug ride 35 car seat,Bummer. Does not work with our Graco snugride 35 carseat. Shipping was fast and product is what it says but doesn't work for me
3,Not what we were looking for!,"The carseat itself was in perfect condition, but it does NOT fit the Graco Snugride 30 car seats--we found out they don't make those individual bases the hard way!"
5,Outstanding!,I probably have over 25 books dealing with product development/inventing/marketing inventions and this book ranks in the top 5% of these books. Outstanding ideas to get your invention to market.
2,Not at all what I was hoping for,I put this audiobook in my Wish List several weeks before it came out. What I was hoping for was some good info on the psychology and execution of the lost art of conversation. What I got was an endless list of do's and do nots. I ONLY recommend this for EXTREME introverts. If you are looking to polish your social skills or socialize with anyone other than friends then keep looking.
4,Not just Alchemy,This is an intriguing and new approach to understanding the intensity of the process of painting. Elkins offers unique insights and theory not on the subject matter that is presented as much on the metaphoric possibilities that link to painitng and its involvment. This book as his others open wonderful doors into further reasearch via thier bibliographies and references. Simply readable this book is worth the read. unforgettable. His newest book about the body should be another book to have.
3,VERY FEW TRACKS,"LEN BARRY WAS ALWAYS RELATED TO 1-2-3, THIS CD SHOWS HE HAD SOME OTHER VERY GOOD RECORDINGS, AND ALSO THERE ARE MANY MORE. IT'S A PITY THAT THE LABEL HAS INCLUDED VERY FEW TRACKS"
1,Horrible directions & product,Very thin material and it completely curls up and melts when you apply the glue as directed. Patch material then shrinks up when glue dries so patch looks awful. I strongly suspect it won't hold water well and won't last even if it does.Take a $1 inflatable toy and cut it into strips. Add a $1 can of PVC glue and you have this entire kit.
5,Worked as advertised,"I bought this just in case I got a hole. Didn't feel great about the buy because I didn't 100% believe it would work under water. Days later I got a large hole on the bottom of the pool near the edge. I think my son caused the hole, but that's another story. My son called for me and told me about the hole, water was gushing out. I had him put his foot on it, then ran to get the repair kit, jumped in, read the directions quickly, applied it under water and held it there. After a few minutes I let go and wow, it worked. I thought it would come off after a while, but it didn't. It stayed on for the rest of the summer. Great buy!"
5,The Best,I have used this through three kids and never found something I couldn't locate in this book. GREAT baby shower gift!
4,This book has been a good guide for me,"Definitely a must for every mother or father who wants to know about his/her daughter/son's growth yearwise. Everything is explained in detail...A big book and a bit heavy to carry around..but if you are not moving around with this book, then a good buy."
4,Berd,"This works fine, simple and has worked with no issue for a week. There is no cover for the battery which would be nice. I didn't realize I had purchased the model that DOES NOT have the ice pack, I will just purchase another. If you are looking for something to help relieve your worries with a busy life, this will do fine."
3,"Interesting and Thorough, but too simple","It's all there, from the beginning to the end, but at a level more fit for elementary school students."
4,Great Book for Intro to Roman History,"No longer the most up to date version (they added two more chapters so keep that in mind students looking to buy this book for a class) but that being said the information is consistent throughout with the newer version. As opposed to many textbooks, this is very well written and anybody with an interest may even find it to be a page turner"
3,"LOVE the shots, hate the machine","I bought this camera in November 2005 and have taken some of the most incredible shots of my life with it. However, it died 6 months after purchase, so I sent it in for repair thinking the warranty would cover it-not so much. I spent the dough to get it fixed and now (6 months later) it has died again. I am so disappointed I could scream."
5,A very telling tale about the human race,"With messages of duty, responsibility and the value of family, it's likely that this book will apeal to a more mature reader. While this last installment of the RAMA tales holds all the magic of the past 3 books, it also holds some very real, if disapointing truths about mankind. We are not the creators chosen race, indeed, we are simply an eliment in one universe of many by which the creator seeks a simplicity only a god may aspire to. Some refreshing ideas on the origins, purpose and existance of the universe and our place in it."
3,A little disappointed,"My son is two years old and he loves Caillou but when I bought the dvd I didn't realise there were other stuff in it besides Caillou which he does not like so after each cartoon part of the dvd I have to fast forward to the other one, but all in all it's a nice dvd."
4,Value for Money...,I really find the product very good..i m looking forward for another purchase soon....bye and keep it up
1,Outdated,"Based on fiction rather than fact. All over the UK convictions are being overturned, in light that Roy Meadows (the creator of MSBP) has been exposed for giving ""fanciful tales"" in court.This is not an accepted diagnosis by any medical body...not the AMA or the American Psychiatric Assoc."
1,So Poorly Written That It Is Distracting,"Sadly, what could have been a really cool book (no shortage of fascinating material) is absolutely unreadable due to the poor writing, which makes it impossible to get through the short tome. The author seems pleased with himself, and while I do not doubt his knowledge, the writing is so flawed that the information is presented in a confusing and irritating and unclear manner. Poor."

1,JUNK,save yourself the time and energy and buy quality air tools. i should have known better. the impact wrench broke and the gun is weak! the soockets are the only thing i got use out of in the whole kit! im pretty sure they will fail somehow as well! again dont waste time or money on this item!
5,Awesome,"This 2 hour DVD is a heart warming, and well-documented story of the ""kingdom of lions"" and the ""world's fastest animal"", the Cheetah. Viewers also learn to appreciate the devotion of researchers, and the fragility of life in the wild. One comes away with a keen sense of environmental stewardship. Wonderful DVD."
1,too small,"My baby is 3 months old, weighs 12.5 lbs and is 24 inches long. These just fit him. They are cut too small to be 3-6 month! They are more like 0-3 month. They also have a slippery feel to the material and there are no snaps on the legs for easy diaper changes."
2,Good Garden Flag But Fades Fast,"I loved everything about the garden flag except that it faded rather quickly. I purchased the flag at the beginning of the 2011 football season and the flag has already faded significantly. So, if you are looking for a garden flag to be placed routinely in the sun then expect its colors to fade within 2-3 months. This product is a good buy if you intend to keep the garden flag indoors or outside in the shade."
5,Polarizer Filter,When you are building are a professional tool box there are some pieces that one must have. I have always considered a c-pl one of the essentials in my camera case. I often shoot where reflections can be an issue. You need this piece to make a quality shot. It stays in the lens all of the time. How else are you going to give bald eagles their due on the water? Shipping time was excellent. I use Amazon because they do not fail me.
3,Not good for many cribs,"My baby does enjoy this toy. He likes to kick it and hear the music, and I like that it has 3 modes - it will just play music for 10 minutes, the baby can kick it to play songs, or it can be set to play like a keyboard when kicked. The only problem (one I see with many crib toys right now) is that it doesn't fit my crib. It has 3 ties that are meant to be attached to the spindles of a crib. The problem is most cribs now (such as mine) have solid ends, and you can't tie anything to them. This toy is meant to be used at the end of a crib, and it simply won't fit. If you have a crib that has slats or spindles on the ends then you will be fine. I don't, so the only way for me to use this toy is to hold it while my baby kicks at it.Fun for him, but not for me."
2,My 5 month old ate the beek,"My baby loved this piano when he was really small, but by the time he got to be 5 months he ripped the beek off and swallowed it. I think that this could be a choking hazard and should be used with CONSTANT supervision and should be taken out of the crib when naping."
1,How basic can one get?,"I bought the book based on two positive reviews. What a disappointment!The book gives childish and extremely basic tips that you would have definately thought of yourself if you were planning to undertake such a project. Try Homemade Biography by Tom Zoellner instead for an inspiring read and a more practical aid. As for this one, I wonder if perhaps it is more suitable for a teenager's school project - though I am more inclined to toss it to the bin..."
1,Pre-opened?,"The bag arrived pre-opened and was spilled all over the other items in the box, there is no good reason or excuse for packing an open bag."
5,one of berts best,i have the original album and i found the cd also. it is one of berts best. i grew up listening to bert kaempfert as well as other artist when i was kid thanks to my mom and dad who had a big collection of records and also had a lot of reel to reel tapes of music so i had a lot to listen to growing up. anyway this is a must to have in your collection as well as orange colored sky album and his christmas album. so if you can get this cd and enjoy.
4,An indispensible guide for river runners!,"This guide has detailed, mile by mile account of the most popular river runs of the Canyonland region. It is an excellent map with notations and topographic contour lines. Locations of the major features of the river, rapids, archaeological sites, etc. are shown. Must have if you are planning to float these rivers."
1,Carafe Height Different From Description,"I ordered this as a replacement for an existing carafe that became cracked. The existing carafe looked the same and was 6.7"" high, just like the product description for this product. When this product arrived it *was not* 6.7"" high but closer to 5.9"". It is not tall enough to work in our Cuisinart coffee machine. Obviously, someone made a mistake in the product description or the one we received was placed in the wrong box. Fortunately, Amazon agreed to give me a complete refund."
1,didn't like it,"I came across this book looking for one about cancer and thought it sounded (and looked) interesting. It wasn't! The whole book is just reading different e-mails the author and her friends wrote to each other, and more than half the time I didn't know what they were talking about. I didn't even know who these people were to the author (like sister, Aunt, etc., I THINK they were friends,) and what some of the things and places mentioned were. It got confusing the more I read and there wasn't much explaination about subjects being discussed, since these were just letters between two people. I found the book very boring and couldn't even get through the whole thing. Very disappointing."
4,Another hard-boiled thriller from Vachss,"Andrew Vachss takes the reader on another journey with his well-known cast of characters embroiled in another child pornography ring crime. Burke's sense of right and wrong remains unerring and Vachss ability to make the reader turn that page is unscathed. Unfortunately, the book loses steam at the end - an all too often problem with Vachss' work. Even so, worth it if you enjoy his other Burke works"
5,Does not disappoint,"The first book in Vachss' Burke series, Flood was hard-boiled and engaging. After completing Flood, I was anxious to read the second installment in the series. I wasted no time purchasing Strega, and can remember actually being excited to read it as I waited for it to arrive in the mail.Now, about 3/4ths of the way through Strega, I can honestly say that it does not disappoint. If you enjoyed Flood, I'll bet you'll be equally enthralled by Strega. I look forward to completing this book, and to starting the next in the series."
1,I want to return! !,"This was horrible for the price! No hardware, no slats and it was too short to fit full size mattress!! I want to return!!!!"
5,great book,I bought this for my grandmother she's from the oldschool and makes pretty much everything from scratch. i thought this would compliment her extrordinary skills and it has. It has recipes from things she you to eat growing up.
4,Many essays,"A partly whimsical excursion into the nooks and crannies of computing, as offered by the editors of PC Magazine. Ostensibly, for each day in 2004, they offer 2 things. The first is a brief retrospective of a significant event in computing history on that day. Some of these recollections may leave you queasy. Was it really THAT long ago that this [event] happened? Strewth, it feels like yesterday!But the bulk of the discussion for each day is some recent article from the magazine. There is really little correlation, if any, between it and the nominal day entry under which it appears in this book.It is really best to treat this book as a stapling of recent articles spanning many computing topics. The quality of the essays is consistently high. There will be an element of serendipity here. Some essays might be spot on to your needs."
2,save your money for the original artists,"I recently became engaged, and my sister, in a very generouse gesture, gave me a set of four of Drew's Famous CD's to help me get started in planning my wedding (Reception Party Music, First Dance, Daddy's Little Girl, and Here Comes the Bride). While the song selection is useful, the recordings are pretty bad. Vocals remind me of American Idol auditions, and the use of electronic music synthesizers is distracting when it comes to classical pieces. You're better off reviewing the song selections and finding original artist recordings, because you won't want to listen to these for long."
3,"Nice kitchen ""gadget""","Convenient for frequently used spices.An identical one that I looked at in another store had plastic that was so hard to move that my wife could never have used it as opening the compartments would have been too hard for her fingers. This one is ""stiff"" but usable.For her it's more of a ""novelty"" in reality but it does keep the spices she uses most frequently where she can find them rather than searching through the cupboards to find them.It was a good ""gift"" item for somebody who's hard to buy things for."
3,you or the post office?,"The CD itself was fine and of course I love the music. However, the plastic jacket was smashed to the point that it is not usable. The other two CDs in the same package were fine."
1,Highway 101: Greatest Hits,My husband and I liked this CD and would recommend it if you like Country Music.We had just seen this group perform and like them and looked for a CD.
3,"Some major problems here,","While the quality of photos I printed are good, even at 8x10, my problem is elsewhere. Anytime the photo isn't in bright sunlight, the photo is garbage. With the flash on the background all but disappears in blackness. Without flash the image appears like a multiple exposure (fuzzy outlines). Action shots are also problematic because of the delay from pressing the button and time until the photo is actually taken. Outside of those problems the camera has held up well to my constant abuse and the short battery life is solved by turning off the auto-display of each picture after you take it & by using rechargeable batteries."
2,"Piece of junk, shouldn't bear the Olympus name","I just bought this at the CompUSA sale where you get a 64 mg card for free with the purchase at $149. My 1.3 mp FujiFilm camera from three years ago takes better pics. I'm on my way to take this back. Yes it is easy to turn on and point and shoot, it takes awhile to ""rev"" up, focus, and shoot... maybe if you want a present for an 8 year old but even for point and shoot it's a big bummer!"
2,Disappointed - can't recommend this camera,"I was looking for an inexpensive digital camera for my daughter, and the Olympus D-395 seemed to fit the bill. We ended up returning the camera, however, because it had some serious flaws:- changing camera settings (picture quality, etc.) resets to the standard setting after turning the camera off. This means if you want pictures at a lower quality, you have to set this every time you start up the camera.- the battery life is poor. Standard AA's don't last long at all (we did not try NiMH or other rechargeables).- the response time from depressing the shutter to taking a picture is longer than any other digital camera I've tried.- the on-screen menuing is very confusing and not intuitive. We always had to consult the manual to figure out how to do simple things like erase all pictures on the camera.So even though the price is right, the camera is not, and I suggest you look at something a little more expensive and more capable."
1,bart gameboy,that is hard game ever single one of bart games made on snes nes gameboy sega ever hard if you ask me. have one on gameboy one bart vs juggernauts
5,Love it!,"Impressive image, big for my big couch and pleasing quality. Spent ages pouring over dozens of different possibilities , finally settled on this. Glad I did. This is truly a nice tapestry throw, I recommend it."
2,Beautiful Shams with Wrong Color,"My daughter bought this for me for Mother's Day because she knew that I like blue and white. When I opened the package I was very disappointed. The color was not as the website described. It was navy blue with ""light pink"" stripe not ""white"" stripe. It was a beautiful design just with the wrong color. Would look nicer with either white or ivory stripe. I won't buy it if I known it was pink stripe."
2,What the Heck?,"The product was good quality, But the Product did not match the picture. It had a slot for a antenna and holes in the bottom.I sent it back."
5,An Excellent Campaign Novel!,An outstanding book about the campaign season in Louisiana. This book features the comeback of the colorful Edwin Edwards. This is an excellent coverage of Edwards sucessful comeback as the Governor of Louisiana. You are able to witness first hand the fundraising machine that Edward's put into motion to unseat an incumbent Republican governor. Also interesting were the numerous campaign rallies that was put together by the Edward's organization. You would definitely have to say that there is not a better book about elections in Louisian than this one. This is definitely a must read for all students of politics.
2,Novelty for Beginners,"Thus book is not well-done. The pictures seem over-colored and blurry with hand shadows. The instruction section gave me a headache. All white yarn on a blue background. White is not a good yarn to demonstrate things in. It tends to bleach out in photos.This book does have a good description of novelty yarns (eyelash, fur, fuzz, flat, chunky, multi-strand, metallic and jelly) in case you didn't know what to call each of them.And the patterns? Just would you would think. Garter, garter and wait for it....a little stockinette! Lots of fuzzy cuffs, a denim jacket ruined with some kind of novelty knitted sleeve and some simple top patterns. The only thing that was interesting to me was a jelly bag mainly because I was not aware of jelly yarn.This is just another book capitalizing on the knitting craze and marketing itself to new knitters who love novelty yarn and need simple patterns."
2,No new idea!,"It's just a direct ""copy"" of the marketing classics by the same authors ""Positioning"". Not many new idea there."
4,Good overall reflection on the present market place,"I found this book very easy to read, and well referenced to many easy to understand company situations. While I can't compare it to the previous book ""Positioning"", I would recommend this is as good value for money"
5,This music will live forever,"With the caliber of musicians in this band this music is destined to live forever. How will any other group hope to mach the diversity of the late Doug Sahms, from down and dirty blues to the twangy pedal steel guitar, this home grown Texas superstar will shine forever. This collection of various Tornado tunes highlights well the sound and soul of the TEXAS TORNADOS."
2,Pricey for little,Beginner/Intermediate level book. What little there is is ok.The content is rather skimpy for the price. Most bridge books that cost twice as much give you 3-4 times the material.Better to buy a book liek Card Play Made Easy.
5,She's Back!,"I bought the album and cassette versions when they were first released many years ago and loved the witty lyrics and catchy tunes Mr. Barton created. The fact that I am an Oz fan and this ties in with the classic movie was a factor.I got the meet Mr. Barton in Atlanta at that time when he was assistant musical director for a touring company of Caberet.If you are a fan of Oz and want to know the true story behind Miss Gulch or if you just like a good caberet act including such great songs as ""Born on a Bike"" (a great take off of Garland's Born in a Trunk, ""Pour Me a Man"", and ""I'm a B#$*h"", you will love this CD!"
4,A necessary addon for your lens,"A camera or camcorder shuold always equip one of the UV lens, it is a necessary protection for your beloved machine. This one is good, and price are fair."
3,Shape,"The details are good, but the laptop from the side view shows it with a thick monitor display (almost 45 degrees) instead of a thinner upright monitor to the laptop. But still a good mold. I ordered this and found out later that there are laptop suckers. I may purchase those with closer inspection."
2,disappointed for the price,"This filter cost about two to three times as much as other filters so I expected a product made in Japan. Instead the seller probably made a few extra dollars selling a Philippine product instead. The ring is flat black and doesn't match the shinny black color of my Japanese camera. The filter itself doesn't seem to make any difference in my photo's, I've shot the same phot with and without the filter. The whole experience was a waste of time and money. I'll probably throw the filter away and order something else since it is too much of a hassle to get what I wanted. This was my first bad buying experience on Amazon."
3,"Music is good, DVD disappointing","The DVD contains no footage of Virgil Fox playing the instrument, but an art show on the screen; so the DVD isn't worth it, but the music is typical Virgil Fox, full of expression and fun to listen to."
5,THIS CD IS RUSS BALLARD...*NOT* RENAISSANCE,"For some reason, AMAZON has this cd artist at the top of the listing listed as 'Renaissance' but it's really Russ Ballard's BEST OF/ANTHOLOGY CD.Russ Ballard is the writer behind the band: Argent, and wrote several independent hits for Bryan Adams, Roger Daltrey and many others.This CD doesn't have anything to do with the band: Renaissance with Annie Haslam.The company that produces this cd is named: Renaissance and that is where the confusion is.I just didn't want anyone to get the wrong cd. These other two reviews are for the TOTALLY wrong cd by the band Renaissance."
3,It works,It works but it can be difficult at first putting on and off. I had to try many different things till he couldn't take it off himself but it has been effective.
5,A hardcore clubhead's dream-vocal lovers look elsewhere,"Richard Vission gives us a continuous bangin' mix of funky house tracks on Disc 1 that will make you feel like you have arrived at a rave during peak hour-with 20 tracks continuously mixed, no song on Disc 1 runs over 4 minutes, and many run under 3 minutes, but you really just have to go with the sounds and not try to pick out favorite songs here. Disc 2 is the gem for collectors, with 9 non-beat mixed, full-length remixes by Vission, including a remix of ""fearless"" by The Bravery (not on any of their CD singles), as well as a hidden bonus track at the end of track 9.CD2 song lengths:1. automatic (6:40)2. somebody (6:32)3. fearless (5:33)4. freeze (3:27)5. higher (6:04)6. rock n roll part 3 (6:13)7. bucci bag (6:57)8. I said (6:00)9. never let me down (14:36)(""never let me down"" runs about 6:51, hidden track begins at around 7:01)"
2,Unsatisfactory Quality,"The glasses arrived promptly. Upon first use, two of the four glasses show condensation between the two 'shells' making them unsuitable for use as intended. With half of the set of four being defective, the price is excessive. With this experience, we would not likely order a similar product. You need to market a more reliable product."
4,MORRISSEY B (SIDE) GOODE,"It's funny how Morrissey is the king of the re-package. But at least this is a great one. This record serves as an example of everything Morissey was and what he should be today. Clean production, witty, insightful lyrics, savvy musicianship. The man is talented, no doubt. It just seems when he concentrates on full even albums, his work shines the brightest. But nothing takes away though from this collection. (If you want a dose of crummy studio outtakes, just pick up My Early Burglary Years.) It's interesting that, with the exception of Hairdresser on Fire, these were all b-sides. Most bands would kill for this selection to make their best record. Unfortunately, Morrissey has hit the skids from a creative point of view the past few years. This record demonstrates just how far he is going to have to come back to show the talent he obviously has. Maybe he will. But let's face it. He never promised he was going to get better."
5,Morrissey is THE BEST THING next to mayonayse!!!!!,OOOOH Morrissey ! WOWIE ZOWIE !this is one fine CD showing off some of his talents as a genious. This CD is full of songs of sorrow but have a happy tune to get you out of your depression. These songs will stick in your head and you'll hum them all the way to the disco. If you are looking for a CD for the car or a nice long trip ......... go for it you STUD!
3,One More Step Beyond?,"I recently purchased this CD along with the new 40th anniversary Twilight Zone 4 CD box. While the opening ""Fear"" and ""Weird"" are truly creepy pieces, I kind of felt like the rest was just 50s TV stuff and not all that ""Beyond."" It's really not much compared to the new excellent TZ CD. Obviously this is a straight reissue of an old early 60s album. It would be cooler if they included more of a description of the conditions and inspiration that composer Harry Lubin worked under, and definately more scary pieces would be appreciated. It's still pretty neat on the whole, though, and if you're a old time SF fan or classic TV fan this probably belongs in your collection."
1,Holster came unglued after one month of use,"The holster is attached to your belt by a leather covered, metal clip. It worked properly for a month, then the glue that holds the clip to the holster failed. The last time I removed the holster from my belt the clip stayed on the belt."
2,Wish the Clip Attachment Was Better,"I bought my case about 2 months ago, and I loved it. However, recently, the clip came detached from the case. Until this happened, I never noticed how poorly the clip is attached to the case. Amazon replaced the case for me, but the new one looks to be made worse than my 1st one, and I don't think it will last as long as the 1st one. The daily attaching to a belt or waistband really stresses the glue keeping the clip attached.I dread going back to the plastic holster, or paying for the case from Cingular. I will check it out though, to see if it is constructed better.It's too bad, because this case really fits my Razr well, and I love the magnetic flap.Edit: Just got back from lunch and the clip came apart. I'm now 0 for 2. I bought the Cingular case, as well as one from Mobile Glove. The latter one has the magnetic closure, so I'll see how it is for a day or so. I'm fairly certain I'll return the Cingular case, as it's more expensive ($27 vs. $20)"
4,Leather Pouch built to last,"This is one way to not lose your phone and keep it in good condition. The magnetic flip-cover allows for quick access, once you get the hang of first, flipping open the cover, then pushing the phone out of the holder with your finger from below. Sounds like a two-step process, but once you use it a few times, the process becomes more natural. I initially liked plastic holster-type holders, but they had three negative points: 1) the top clip will eventually break and 2) they sometimes poke upward when I carried my baby infant and 3) they could get bumped hard enough and eject your phone onto the pavement. I'm one that is on the go, so this Pouch fits me just right. The only two drawback are that you have to wear a thin belt, as its clip is quite tight and difficult to place on the belt. But it will definitely not come loose. But I'm getting better at it. And second, I cannot see the front of the Razr so I have to remove the phone in order to see the call info."
4,Realistic? Yes Disturbing? No,"While the sad childhood of the author has recently been documented, I could not disagree more with some of the reviews submitted for these books. The inappropriate actions of the younger characters, Little Bear and Edith, are representative of the impulsive, sometimes ""naughty"" things that children do. In each case, the children feel remorse about their bad behavior, are disciplined (yes, sometimes spanked -- HORRORS!) but then the story ends with the parental figure (Mr. Bear) understanding and forgiving the children for their actions. Just the fact that so many people remember the photographs and characters so vividly (some 35+ years later), is a testament to the universal appeal of these stories. Perhaps the flaky parents of today could learn a few things from Mr. Bear. Children are children and they need to be called on their bad behavior, understand why it is wrong, and then quickly forgiven."
4,could use improvement,"We installed this in a sliding screen door. It was easy to install and looks good. However, our cat could not learn to use the plastic cat door. The magnet was too strong, and if we ""helped"" her through, the plastic door would fall on her tail and freak her out. I contacted the company that makes it hoping there was a way to remove the magnet. There isn't. They had no suggestions. We replaced the door with a makeshift screen door and it works great. This door should be made with a screen flap option. If you are putting it in a screen door, then you don't need the flap to be solid. It would be nice if they provided a screen flap with a lightweight frame and a weak magnet."
5,the Complete Idiot's Guild to Assertiveness,"I love the way these books are put together. Although I do feel the name is a misnomer, I feel the name should read ""the Average Persons Guild"". All in all a good read with insite & good examples.Also makes for good reference. Thanx"
2,A wasted investment,"I thought that by actually reading this book, I could be a more assertive person. Unfortunately, all the information in the book did very little to improve me. All this book did was give examples of when and where to be assertive but did very little on HOW to be assertive. By reading this book, you get theoritical knowledge not the practical knowledge which is really what you want to get out of this book."
2,Unhelpful to me,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I found myself questioning the quality of the ""Idiot's Guide"" series (that I had previously had good experiences with). I was in a situation where I needed practical effective skills that I could use and this book provided none of them. Instead of practical skills it suggested many unrealistic long-term sometimes gender exclusive excersises that felt more like the author wanted to SOUND like someone in a possition to help you but realised that he wasn't qualified to do so and instead offered excuses and diversions. The chapters are short, juvenile, and loaded with uncomfortable ugly illustrations and bogus trite little bits of pseudo-wisdom that you forget in an instant, because that is their true function as space filling gibberish and insultingly dumb statements of the obvious. I read the whole book, waiting for the next chapter to contain helpful information, and it never did."
5,The Best,"This film is powerful, poetic and highly evocative of the most likely real relationship between Vincent and Theo. You constantly feel the underlying stress and yet great love between the two brothers.It takes an artist like Robert Altman (and his son Stephen the set designer) to make great film about a great artist."
3,Good value for the money,"This semi-bootleg set features three discs of 1927-1931 Brunswick sides, and one of the late-40s radio transcription sessions. The sound quality is okay although at least one track has the ending clipped. A nice intro for those just starting their Nichols/20s jazz collection. I'm not sure what the source materials are - possibly the Classics CDs for the Brunswick sides?"
4,Our Two Year Old Loves It,I purchased this advent calendar to keep for next year since our daughter has just turned two. Then she played with some Playmobil toys at her grandmothers and I decided to give her this now. It was much easier to assemble than other reviews said. I was worried that she'd want to take each piece away and spread them around the house before seeing the whole scene but she's enjoying watching the park scene unfold. She loves animals so she's happy even if the box just holds a couple of little birds. After Christmas she'll love having the parts to play with. She's also good about only opening one box per day which is a huge surprise to me.
2,Bad research on my part,"8/10/12 I bought all three of his books at once from Amazon. A big mistake. All three are much the same. I expected to learn the methodology behind his approach to meditation. and none of them address meditation at all, let alone the methodology. I thought about returning them but I can't get 10 cents on the dollar. I might donate them to some one but I don't know who? They have a center in Buena Park Calif. which is not to far from me. I think I'll send them there.Ed Holzinger8/18/12 PS. I stand corrected. The last book ie, World Beyond World, discuss the meditation metodology but not the process."
5,Entertainment with depth,"Refreshing to read a book with characters that posses a full range of human characteristics rather than being cookie cutter good and evil, even when they are somewhat despicable as in the case of Gwynn. I enjoyed the soul searching the characters undergo, including the ongoing debate over a higher power and the nature of said God. The philosophizing maybe a bit much for readers in search of something a little lighter, but I found it thought provoking even if I lack the depth of character to mull Bishop's weighty philosophizing over for long periods of time.In short a great read even if you are in it only for an entertaining story with some very memorable characters."
5,Incredible,"I am a professional church musican. Wren's book is inspiring to the point of reminding me why I'm in this business, A ""must have"" for any church professional or anyone interested in music in the church."

4,If only more languages had a book like this...,"While this title probably won't help your development skill, it provides a great deal of insight into the design of C++. Parts of C++ may seem a bit odd (crufty, overly complex, however you want to think of it). In this book Stroustrup clearly explains the motivations and tradeoffs that went into every feature of the language. While you may not agree with the decisions, understanding the thought process behind them is incredibly interesting and will give you a better appreciation for the language."
5,Great to accessorize with for the convenience,"Product was well wrapped, delivered in original packaging, delivered on time. A great product for mobility, I would definitely recommend this merchant, it's worth the investment."
5,Wonderful book.,Gorgeous photographs in both color and archival B&W. This well-researched book covers the brutality of Chinese foot binding and its societal impact in very objective detail. No feminist rants or amateur anthropology. Definitely a worthwhile read for anyone who's interested in women's issues and the best book I've seen on this obscure subject.
2,Not so much!,"I was expecting slow, fluid movements, also Hawaiian style movements. The video starts slow, then jumps to an extreme fast pace and doesn't give you enough time to hold the movements. After doing it once, I gave it away."
5,Joseph- You Love The Show? Get This Book!,"This book is wondeful! I was a little weary about getting it because I wasn't sure what songs it contained. I read a review that said all songs were included, but I was still unsure. I got the book sooner than I expected and it surpassed all of my expectations! EVERY song is in this book. Even chorus parts! I am so glad to have found this book before I purchased a ""highlights"" book for the same price. If you love ""Joseph"" and want music for auditions or just to have, this book is the definite choice!"
2,Not what you think,"Though this is an actual choral score, which sets it apart from all the Piano/Vocal/Guitar junk one usually finds, BE AWARE that this score does NOT contain all the songs from the Joseph production that has recently made such a splash. Most importantly, it opens with Jacob and Sons, not the Narrator introduction to Any Dream Will Do. Unfortunately, I purchsed the score on the basis of the first review I read here (by Michael from Commerce, TX), which is inaccurate. I was disappointed and returned my copy."
1,Small face more suitable for a woman's watch,Disappointed in the watch face size - it is very small. Product photo is somewhat deceptive. Definitely more suitable for a woman.
5,One of my all time favourites,"For 35 years, this album has been THE basement lounging album. Long in my parents record collection, It is now mine, on cd. To listen to it brings back memories of my parents swaying and swinging together. The highest quality in production, with a fat bass sound way ahead of its time. A gem."
1,NO BATTLE SONGS PRESENT,"I bought this album with the full expectation that the battle songs would be on it. After all, the CORE of the ENTIRE movie is based on the battles. So, tell me then, how could it be that NOT ONE battle song is present on the CD? I felt completely misled, and ripped off. The songs on the CD have nothing to do with the movies core energy....DANCE BATTLES. So, your lucky to see even one star here, there should be negative 5 stars for the incredible 'bait and switch' that the studios have pulled on us moviegoers."
1,"Two Words ""SUCKED AZZ!!""","First of all, why spend $15 dollars on a cd that sucks such as this one. I thought the movie was awesome with all the dance moves so you can kinda figure that the soundtrack would be awesome too. ""WRONG"", the soundtrack sucked and there was no battle songs. Here is a list of some of the battle songs. Got Bless imesh!DMX-get on the floorTimbaland and Magoo-dropNas-HeavenRedman-time for some actionHopefully this is not a money scheme trying to get people to buy two cds. They wonder why people file share. With cd's such as this, it makes perfect sense."

3,WHAT SONGS ARE IN THE MOVIE??????,"SUP YALL I JUST SAW YOU GOT SERVED AND I WANNA KNOW IF ANYONE KNOWS ALL THE SONGS THEY BATTLED TOO.....LIKE THAT SONG IN THE TRAILER.....THAT GOES LIKE THIS "" YOU DONT KNOW BUT YOU GON FIND OUT"" I KNOW ITS NOT THAT DROP SONG BY TIMBALAND...CAN ANYONE HELP ME?

2,Monotonous,"The premise of this book is fascinating: what happens to a man when he does nothing but watch television over a two-week period? I expected a fun narrative about how the author spun out, going deeper and deeper into his TV hell. Instead, the author gives a play-by-play, often at 10-minute intervals, of what he watched and what he thought of the show of the moment, which takes us inside his world but does not comment on it. The book could have been titled ""Reports from the TV Front: An Examination of What's on TV at This Very Moment."" This book would have been far better if Brownstein had sat back after compiling his diary and had written a more general description of what happened to him on his journey, rather than what was on the tube (because who really cares?). The diary entries would have worked best as add-on elements rather than as the core of the narrative."
1,Cheap junk that takes 3 months to ship......,"These are low quality, seem to be chrome plated plastic, and while the picture has a polished/brushed look, it isn't. Also the backside has sort of sharp ridges. In the end, you get about what you pay for. Finally, it takes months for Amazon to ship it out."
5,Jewelry is great,I love this jewelry kit. It is great quality and the variety has everything that I needed for my new piercings.
4,Decent Razr Pouch,I bought this pink pouch for my wife and she likes the feel of it and the protection is very good.
5,An amazing piece of work,"INSIDE THE WILD WILD WEST is one of those marvelous books that is so well-written that by the end of the book you feel as though you were actually THERE on the set of this classic series, and you have some knowledge of the personalities of all the people involved. Great, funny, fact-filled writing and a must-have for any fan of this tremendous Western/sci-fi/spy TV series."
3,Polluted Waters,"I liked the mastering of these movies. I liked John Waters' commentary. (He even makes a funny reference to Osama bin Laden!) I did NOT like the unnecessary letterboxing of these full-frame movies (a problem that the Touch of Evil DVD also had). I know, from reading Waters' autobiography Shock Value, that he'd cropped the tops and bottoms of these two films so the films could run in most theaters. Still, couldn't AOL Time Warner (!!!) have put both the widescreen and full-screen versions of these trash classics onto each disc in this two-disc set?"
5,"""I WANT MY CHA-CHA HEELS!!!""","THANK GOD ""Female Trouble"" is finally available on DVD. I can't wait to see Chicklett and Conchetta taunt the ""definetly-reeeetarded"" Taffy into the attic to play ""car crash."" Or watch as Dawn Pigport chops off Aunt Ida's hand and put her in a big birdcage. Poor Gator. Poor, poor Gator. Thank you, John Waters, for making one of the ALL TIME great movies."
2,you MUST have an open mind....and I mean really open...,"I have yet to understand why Pink Flamingos is probably one of the most popular films of Mr. Waters. Personally, I do not like Pink Flamingos, but I do like Female Trouble (minus the ending-that was just stupid). I would definitely buy the Hairspray/Pecker combo over this one. It's much more enjoyable."
5,FEMALE TROUBLE: One of the best comedies of all-time!,"""Female Trouble"" is, by far, John Waters' best film. Ironically, it is also the most sadly neglected of all of his films. Long unavailable for several years, I am ecstatic to see it remastered and rereleased on DVD (with ""Pink Flamingos"" added in).There's a reason why the majority of reviews of this release focus on ""Trouble"" instead of the more well-known ""Flamingos"": ""Trouble"" outclasses ""Flamingos"" in almost every respect. While ""Flamingos"" may be more visually shocking, ""Trouble"" is much funnier ... and meaner.While Waters' skills as a director have improved immeasurably since 1974, ""Trouble"" is his best script. In conclusion, ""Flamingos"" is an occasionally funny freakshow, while ""Trouble"" is a masterpiece and should be ranked with ""Duck Soup"" and ""M*A*S*H"" as one of the best film comedies ever made."
1,"Too small, not declared size","While outer size is, indeed, 8 inches, the frying surface itself is barely 6 inches. Had to send it back, have no use for this tiny thing."
1,Distasteful diatribe against the average American,"A casual read of this book conjures up the question: what type of person could have such a despicable and distorted opinion of life and values that most Americans hold important to themselves and their families? Having just seen this woman on O'Reilly, my picture of this despicable person was confirmed. She had her own agenda and totally disregarded the topic of conversation and failed to answer any questions she was asked. She forced herself and her attitudes upon the television audience much like she attempted to force her opinions upon the readers. She would not shut up and allow others to share their opinions. In her personal life, the subject of abortion or anti-abortion should not be an issue at all since I believe she is one person practicing abstinence that is certainly not by choice."
3,Good Enough but Not the Best,"This computer desk is good enough if you just want something to use and are in a hurry, but there are better ones for the money if you want to take the time to look. The finish on this bubbles and peals easily and looks bad right away when it does. Mine was pealing within a month of owning it to the point where it looked really old. It also isn't as sturdy as I would like since i have young children."
5,The best horror book I've ever read.,"I first read this book about 15 years ago, and to date, I have read it more times than I can count. This is THE book to which I compare all other horror novels. I have recommended this book, and will continue to recommend it, to absolutely anyone who wants a good scare. I still get chills when I read this book - and usually even have a nightmare or two. Pike shows in his adult novels, especially this one (and Falling, another book that I highly recommend) that he has much more to offer than teenybopper stories. If you haven't read this book yet, you're missing out!"
5,sensational!,"I've read this book about a million times and I still do not get sick of it. The book is a scary, well told horror story that made me constantly question my friend about it,(who read the book before me) saying ""So does this mean...?"" and afterwards wanted to strangle me. The writting is great as it kept me reading on and not skipping pages like I normally do, and the characters were very individualistic.Basically it's got a sensational storyline that is well told and that's very rare."
5,Best book I've read on parenting,"Between the two of us, my wife and I have looked at 30 or so books on parenting and read about 10 or so.This is *the* best book on parenting we've ever seen.She gets the theory right in terms of ""intrinsic consequences"" rather than ""extrinsic punishment/reward"" as Alphie Kohn describes so well in ""Punished by Rewards. But she goes much further by providing a lot of real-world insight and examples that really ring true. She's also admits that she's had bad parenting moments. That helps to put the reader at ease."
3,How translations differ!,"I've read two translations of Popa's works. Some individual poems were in both collections. The other translation seemed far better--more poetic. It is called ""Homage to the Lame Wolf"" -- translated by Charles Simic. In fact the difference in the two translations for the same poem was virtually unbelievable. This one may have been more literal, I don't know, but it's far less satisfying and lyrical. The other seemed to better reflect the poet's feelings. I discovered Popa by listening to the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago audiotape, ""The Yawn of Yawns: On the Psychology of Revelation--An Exploration of the Poetry of Vasko Popa"" by Josip Pasic. The tape's catalog description states: ""the work of te great 20th century Slavic poet...talks about the most basic geometry of the human mind--the archetype of archetypes."" It's great. The translator has done a wonderful service to the English reading public."
2,lame,"me and a couple of friends wanted to rent a scary movie and somehow we picked this one. what a mistake. it wasn't one bit scary/creepy, and most of the acting was sub-par. we found ourselves laughing at times, which isn't good. the first story was just plain boring. it's about some indian statue that comes to life. 30 minutes of torture. the 2nd story was the best, but that doesn't say much. its about 4 kids who swim out to a raft and some killer blob chases after them. pretty funny stuff. the last story is called the hitchhiker. some parts were funny, but it dragged on way too long. Overall, creepshow 2 doesn't live up to the first. 2 stars for making us laugh."
4,Animated Join Ruins It,"Creepshow 2 is almost a very good sequel except for the awful animation that looks totally out of place here, making the film look cheap and shoddy.The stories are quite good with a the second story being the favorite as horny teenagers get trapped on a raft surrounded by (what appears to be) a hungry flesh eating oil slick.So try and ignore the animation if you can because the stories here are well worth a look."
1,"A negative review by a talented ""loser""!","Ok, I wrote a review of CREEPSHOW 2 not that long ago, and I just read a review by ""Tyreek, from the United States of America"" who I think called me a ""loser"" and with ""low-quality"" opinions"". Whatever, TYREEK youre a low quality writer! I can say anything I want about this film! And you, with your poor ""taste"" of films, can't even spell director George Romero's last name! RAMANO! He's not a Soprano, you know! Anyway, later people. Hopefully you should think wisely by reviewing a good movie and not a bad one!"

2,COMPLETE RUBBISH,"AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, THE FIST CREEPSHOW IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE. BUT SADLY, THIS ONE FAILED TO LIVE UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS THAT CREEPSHOW LEFT BEHIND. LOT ONLY IS THERE BAD ACTING, BUT THERE IS UNACCISARY NUDITY AND LANGUAGE. UNLESS YOU ARE DOING IT TO COMPLETE TOUR COLLECTION, DO NOT BUY."
3,Creepshow Lite,"Creepshow was a howling horror classic. With a great set of stories, and fun twists in the story lines. The animation in this second film set the bar much lower than the first. It is only the first let down among the many revealed in the stories told. These stories could be considered the story lines rejected for the first film. All of them are below the standard of the first. If you are looking for an equal to the first Creepshow you will be disappointed. If you expect less it may be entertaining to see... once. I have seen loads of crap DVD's so it still gets 3 stars."
2,story #2,"The raft is the best of the three. This is the only one that creeped me out! This is creephow right? Then why didn't the others short movies pull it off? Story #1 was more about teachin us a lesson of what goes around comes around, which is fine but make it scary. That silly story with Sephen King from creepshow one was more entertaining than this one. And that last story was just too predictable. So go with creepshow 1 first and if u do decide to try this skip to the RAFT it was scary, nasty, gory and downright disgusting. Picture being surrounded by the BLOB but it can't get to u cause its in jail but if u visit the jail or fall asleep where or when the inmate can get u. That's the raft!"
2,Carttoonish Horror Romp,"Well, it's better than the first Creeshow, but not by much. It's so bad it's just bad."
4,Must have filter,This filter is great and a must have for any lens. I don't know if the S-HMC filter is worth the extra money since this one seems to do the job quite well.
5,Its a Hoya HMC filter from a good seller.,"Product arrived in a quick and fast ship time. Packaged well and product is as described. Good seller, good product. enuff said."
5,TazMania,Good game if you like taz then this is the game for you because this whole game is about taz and it's just a really good game you'll be playing this game for hour's on end. get this game you won't reget it.
4,It is sturdy and runs smoothly.,I bought and installed a less coarse sanding belt and it doesn't track as well as the one sent with it. It runs with a half inch of the belt off the rollers on one side and not to the edge of the rollers on the other side. Maybe a problem with the belt.
3,not had a problem,"I usually buy better name tools, but picked this up as I didn't think I'd use it often but I do. I use this for sanding plywood as well as solid woodedge trim pieces flush to the plywood to hide the grain.I've not had any problems with belt running everywhere, you just adjust it till it tracks and i've changed the belt several times and neverhad to fuss with it.That's said this is a pretty basic use and pretty much the only wood i've used it on is birch ply or poplar wood, but i've not had any problem there."
1,A trash was sent to me!!!!!!!!!!!,The item is NOT what it is supposed to be: dust can is missing and it can NOT work normally.Be aware of this seller.
5,This is an awesome CD,"Robbie Williams' masterpiece ""Swing When You're Winning"" is a great ablum, with outstanding covers of Capitol's classics. This is really great to play at night. I don't know anything about Robbie; I am not a big fan of his, but I liked this CD. A must have for music fans."
1,Give this a wide berth,"What a hateful album this is. Each song, a classic in it's own right, eviscerated by this glorified club singer. The song ""It was a very good year"" illustrates my point, you hear Williams's voice, and it's dire, but then to have Sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed.I would be surprised if this sells even one copy, especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this. Which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original? Do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs, if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh."
4,Pretty good actually...,a new sinatra? i like this cd a lot...wear the silk robe..get a glass of cognac light a cigar go to the library light up the fireplace...get the girl and make out with this music...
2,Go buy a Sinatra album,"Every singer has his song, on this album Robbie nails Beyond The Sea and the rest of the songs suck. Louis Armstrong nailed Mack the Knife and Frank Sinatra nailed It Was A Very Good Year. Robbie William does not have the depth these singers have to pull off these songs. Sorry. Hope you did not purchase this album. You can get the Finding Nemo soundtrack for half the price and it has Beyond the Sea on it."
4,Very pleasant book,"This book is like a hot cup of tea. Simple, uncomplicated, and sometimes just what you need as a little pick-me-up. This book can make life just a little bit nicer, without any of the contempt for Americans heaped upon us by other condescending French lifestyle books. Robert Arbor just seems like such a nice, likable man devoid of pretentious snobbery who could get along with anyone, anywhere he goes. It's a very sweet book."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought there would be more receipes in this book; it is mostly a glowing tribute to appreciating life in the countryside. I tried a few of the scanty receipes in the book and they didn't turn out well. I'm just a so-so cook. So if you are looking for simple, easy, French country cooking, this is NOT the book for you."
5,crystal clear,"I'm a newbie to SLR's and came across several reviewers who said that this protection filter was worth the money for the Nikon 18-200mm lens. So far it's been excellent -- at least for my peace of mind. Sturdy construction. Distortion free. Tested it against different backgrounds without any hint of yellow. Pictures shot with my D90 and Nikon 18-200mm lens look the same with and without the filter to my untrained eyes. I'd say that this protection filter was worth the money. Shipping time was reasonable, about on par with most merchants on Amazon."
1,iStuck,Extremly hard to push ipod 4G into case. Forget about getting it back out. Had to break case and risk scratching the ipod. Good only for users who intend never to take it out of the case.
1,Exercise caution when ordering,"The designation of iPods is confusing at best; there are model numbers, but which constitutes third generation, fourth generation, photo model, etc. is vague. I purchased this case for a 20 GB color display model (not designated as a ""photo,"" but does display photos) and it did not fit. Half way into the case, the ""required"" plastic (cellophane-like) sleeve bunched up and the iPod was impossibly stuck. The retailer I purchased both from had no idea of the incompatibility (Contourdesigns fault), and I was forced to use a hacksaw to break the case open and retrieve the Pod.Be sure to check the thickness of your iPod model before ordering. If it is over 0.57"", it will not fit. The case is made of a VERY strong polycarbonate material and I'm fairly sure I would have liked it except for the unfortunate situation resulting from the company's poor specifications of which model would fit properly."
1,doesn't fit!,"The case as described should have fit the model of ipod that we have, but did not. In attempting to make it fit, the case was damaged and so could not be returned. All in all an unfortunate purchase but lesson learned."
1,Case is not that good...,"First, the buttom cap cannot really fit well. It's not a big deal, but the top is a big problem. From the description we know it can let people attach an iTrip w/o removing the case. However, itrip cannot really attach the ipod well. The problem is that itrip cannot boradcast the signal well. You will get lots noises from radios and doesn't matter you change to other freq. Anyway, if you are not using itrip, it's a good deal."
3,Get the book from a library,"If you're a novice you'll learn something from this book. Book contains a lot of general information in the abstract, but little if any nuts and bolts on the specific details of financing and putting together deals. Obtain the book from a library rather than spending your money."
3,Audio Version,This audio version is loud and shrill and often hard to understand. The 5th cd is only some music. I am certain I would prefer the unabridged reading of this novel. This does not deliver the real drama and excitement of the book.
5,Neil is on fire!,"This album is hard to listen to in one sitting, but it works really well in doses. The whole thing is one firey explosion of noise. Neil is absolutely on fire here. This is my second favorite NY album after Tonight's the Night."
4,Like a wall of sound wrapped in stainless steel,"You have to admit that ""Ragged Glory"" has stood the test of time well, like a wall of sound wrapped in stainless steel. This recording exhibits that take-no-prisoners energy and brimstone Neil Young and Crazy Horse generated in their finer moments. Mr. Young has tried his hand at various genres of rock, but this set of flat-out, hard-core rock and roll numbers shows how great he can when he delivers a focused rant.It sounds best, in my opinion, played at high-volume through vintage stereo gear and speakers."
4,album review vs. person review...,"to ""A music fan from Littleton, CO USA"":I believe we are suppose to write a review for the material presented on the album, not our personal opinion of the artist as a ""human being"". And if mr. young does have to step on/over a few of his friends (which is very debatable) in order to create his art, then so be it. To us, the fans, neil young is here to entertain. I could not care less about what he does in his personal life. So keep whatever neil-hating propaganda you have to yourself and let the rest of us enjoy the beauty that is NEIL.no damn-near-60 year old man rocks like neil... hell, NOBODY rocks like neil! long live the king! ...and don't do drugs."
5,"A great, great album","I love this album. The crunchy grunge rock never lets up. And it is not mindless noise, either. Young has a marvelous sense of melody as well as the heart of a rocker. And so even crunching rockers like song number three and ""Mansion on the Hill"" have tuneful melodies. And even the song with the bad word (song number three) accurately describes something we all do. It describes how I feel after a particularly rough day at work. And the long rockers (""Over and Over,"" ""Love to Burn"") will brand their melodies in your mind and have you humming them for weeks. Buy this essential 90's recording."
5,THIS IS IT,...so i'm cruisin around amazon just checking things out readin some reviews and thinking about my favorite albums when i decide to see what others have said about my all-time fav ragged glory and i just about sh*t myself when i see there are none so the world is my oyster now what do i say i say i'm still so stoked over this album i dont think i'll ever hear anything better it blows my mind gives me goosebumps and i want everyone to hear what i hear i'm not sayin this is one of the best this is it
5,Buy this filter!,"I wouldn't say much if the Amazon dos not require at least 20 words. This is not UV filter. It is lance protection neutral color (NC) filter. My review for this filter is: Made in Japan is not made in China. Sound different, and looks and feels excellent. I did not believe on my yes, but it is!Happy!Amazon deliver it well. Clean and not opened, In hard clear box.George"
3,Not much of a fun game,It came in early and fast. This game is kinda boring and frustrates me when the sim lasts 2 minutes without things like food and sleep. It and OK game.
3,Fun until 50% done.,"This was a fun game until I finished helping the castaways. After that it became pointless because I could escape the island. After helping the castaways, the only reason to stay on the island is to finish your collections, which is pretty boring. The game also freezes at times so to continue playing I needed to restart the DS. I would rent the game or not buy it at all because it just isn't worth all the money, for the time you actually enjoy it."
2,One of the Most Frustrating Games I've Ever Played,"I too am a big fan of the Sims franchise, and had a blast playing the (highly addictive) Sims 2 for the DS. But I am ready to throw Castaway into the sea.While a cool concept and fun to get started on, it becomes very frustrating very quickly. I spend all my time now hunting one particular kind of fish so I can progress through the game. It's been three days and I still have not caught the stupid fish.I guess the game is still too new to have a helpful walkthrough online, but from what I've read in the forums there are a lot of people as frustrated as I am at other points in the game which makes me not very anxious to move forward anyway. There is something to be said for a challenge--but not to the point that it makes you become so frustrated you want to put down the game!"
4,"Simple, Different, Overall-- fun","Sims 2 Castaway was a great addition to the Sims line. When I first got it, I couldn't stop playing it. It's quite addictive, but not too lengthy. The time in the game passes quickly, making it hard to fish for certain fish or catch certain bugs at points in the game. My biggest complaint would be the other people you interact with: they have no patience and require you to drop everything for you. If you don't finish their task, they become angry with you, and it takes a while to make them happy again. For some people, you have to give them items you do not have yet because you have not finished other quests yet.All the same, it was a great game. I had a lot of fun playing it. I absolutely loved the use of the stylus in this game, especially in the games. It added a degree of difficulty that I thoroughly enjoyed.I am eagerly awaiting the next installment of the new era of Sims games on the DS."
2,Not worth it!,I thought this game would be something like Ubrz in the City or Bustin Out with missions to complete and fun things like that. But this game is no fun at all! You are stranded on a desert island and you have to try to get off. The conversations with people are no fun and the objectives are unclear and no fun to complete. I like sims game but not this one! Save your money and buy something fun like Thrillville.
4,"Payne's Among Whales is a rich, lovingly told story","My favorite parts of the book are the chapters in Patagonia, the descriptions of the wind, the culture of the Patagonian people, and of course, the behavior of the whales who lie in the shallow ocean beneath the cliffs. The mother whales and their calves sleep in the shallows, just below the observation center that Payne established. His delight in having found these elusive whales is infectious."
4,Pretty good,"The projector serves its purpose. I needed to make some party decorations, so I enlarged Mario, Luigi, and a piranha plant on poster board. The light wasn't super bright, but they still came out well. The plastic is cheap, and it gets a little warm, but I think this was the cheapest one I found. There was a little issue with the company that I ordered it from (TCP Global Corp). I was worried after I read some of the comments about them, but it was too late by then. I still hadn't received shipping information about the projector by the time the first day in the estimated shipping date range came. I called and they had never received the order, but they did bill me. It turned out that there was a ""glitch,"" and I wasn't the only one it happened to. They were very nice and sent it right out. I received it about 2 or 3 days after calling. Overall, I would recommend it for the price (about $39.00)."
1,NOT MICROWAVE SAFE,"The bowls looked nice. But are not durable. The first one broke while washing it, and the smaller one literaly exploded in my hand when i took it out of the microwave. within two weeks both of these bowls broke. Im not sure if i just got a bad set. But i would definately not recomend them unless your a fan of cuts and burns."
3,Wish I read ALL the reviews first,"Like a few others I tore my Netbook apart, added a third antenna, installed the intel card, put it all back together... just too find out I can still only connect at 54Mbps. Not 130.Long story short....my router only works at 2.4GHz this card only send/receives the N channel at 5MHz. I would need a 5MHz or dual band router to get the speed increase. Wish I bought the 5100 card. Buyer beware. This card did increase my range though so it wasn't a total waste of time."
3,Beware this is the Intel Link 4965 not the Intel Wimax Link 5350/5150,"The card itself performs fine.However, it is important that you read the product description well as this is the Intel Link 4965 and it will show up in a search of the Intel WiMax 5300/5350 series card. There is no WiMax functionality with the card Amazon is shipping. Please be aware.Amazon, please do a better job on listing the series in the title of the product too to avoid confusion."
3,So so CD.,"Though I loved Michael Martin Murphey's Christmas CD, this one isn't as good. Maybe I just have to listen to it more."
5,I love cowboys,"Michael Martin Murphy arranges and sings traditional cowboy songs in a straight forward manner, i.e. the way they were written. The liner notes give the listener the history of the song and the origination. This CD brings back the ""county and western"" genre that has been missing for the past several years."
3,OK,I'm not convinced this was brand new when we bought it so I don't want to be that harsh. It may have been refurbished - although it did not say so. It worked ok.
4,Good reference material for English classes,"This is my son's high school sophomore English textbook. We purchased it recently from Amazon because he had misplaced his copy, and had an assignment due that required the use of the text. Besides being the necessary book for assigned work, it is an excellent reference for writing styles, rules, and formats. I refer to it often when proofreading my son's papers in many subjects....it contains many clear example.The only drawback is the cover...the paperback cover bends & tears with use and being tossed around between lockers and backpacks. Buy the hardback!!!"
4,The Complete Book of Bible Trivia,We use this book every Sunday before Church. To get info on a question to ask for the next Sunday.
1,I never received this DVD,I ordered this DVD months ago and never received it. Will you be sending it soon? I still would like to have it. Thank you.
2,Great picture when it works !,I have the WD-57731 Which is in the same family as other similar models for this TV.I purchased it on 1/20/07On 3/29/09 I am without a tv once again and am going on my third lamp replacement.The Tv often overheats and shuts itself down.@ $200 dollars per lamp this is a real problem. Mitsubishi will not even admit that there is a defect wtith these sets.Shame on Mitsubishi and I sure wish I had gotten the JVC that I was going to buy.
5,Help from Chilton and Amazon,"This was by far the best investment I could have made, it was very helpful in the repairs that were needed . I would recomend this item to anyone that has to work on a vechicle."
4,very original and entertaining!,"Well, first off, this is the kind of book I like. Throw in a few plots that doesn't make sense with each other and then throw an UHA! ending ending that connects them. The story was very well written by this newcomer. It just had some of the flaws every new writer has, like, sometimes I had to go back to say ""Oh! THAT was what he was talking 'bout"". I saw the movie at a special screening back in January and it was very good, and it had some major changes(the main character in the book is a dude and in the movie is a chick, Katie Holmes- she did a great job). I think I liked it so much 'cause I've felt some of the pressures this guy has felt, though I'm NOT crazy, I think. I'll describe the book as Donnie Darko meets A Beautiful Mind. overall 4/5."
1,Loathesome cast of characters in this book,"This book has the set-up of a great suspense novel: Three friends go swimming one evening and one of them mysteriously disappears. The intriguing premise, however, quickly devolves into not so much a mystery as a soap opera. Even that would be fine, except that all of these characters are so deeply flawed as to be thoroughly loathesome. I found myself rooting for the worst to happen to all of these people. And, when the big ""mystery"" is unveiled, the protagonist -- Kayla's -- actions are completely unbelievable and moronic. This is the second Elin Hilderbrand novel I've read and it will certainly be my last. Even Nantucket's charms couldn't save this mess. On a nitpicking note, the author shows a decided lack of imagination. For example, the three friends who go swimming one night each year nicknamed themselves -- wait for it -- the Night Swimmers. YAWN."
2,Not her best...,"I purchased this book and a few others of Hilderbrands' after loving Barefoot and The Island. This book doesn't compare at all. For being one of her shorter books it still dragged on. It has a mystery twist to it. But halfway I realized I didn't really care to find out the ending. The plot seemed a bit idiotic, and it somewhat saddens me to say it because I really enjoy many of Hilderbrand's books. This one is just a waste of time."
4,Made me homesick!!!,"As a former 10 year resident of Nantucket and reader of the author's previous book that had the island as the setting, I was a bit skeptical because I wasn't crazy about the last one but this book I couldn't put down and read it in one day! Now the only problem is waiting two years for the next...."
3,Destructive secrets and lies in Nantucket,"This novel dealt with a group of 3 women who have an annual midnight party/swim off the coast of Nantucket. They keep a tradition of each woman telling a secret that they have kept. When one of the women disappears, instead of pulling together, their lives veer off course dramatically. Hidden secrets, lies and agendas threaten to tear apart their formerly perfect seeming lives. I found this a little hard to read as I found none of the women to be particularly empathetic and watching them betray each other and themselves was not pleasant to read. At times, the character's behavior seemed out of place and out of character. Int the end we find out the truths as they begin to rebuild their lives."
4,Engrossing Story - Ending a bit of a disappointment but would read the SEQUEL,"I read Beach Club by Hilderbrand (which I loved) and really liked the way she sets up a story. Nantucket Nights was somewhat of the same but different enough to keep my interest. I had a hard time putting it down and found it a very engrossing story along the lines of a ""who dunnit?"". I must say I was disappointed with the ending because I wanted MORE but would highly recommend reading it anyway. You will just have to fill in the blanks yourself which is okay. She could definitely write a sequel.... hint hint"
5,This CD was TIGHTTTT!!!! REAL HARDCORE!!,The lyrics on the CD are tight..PIZZO flowz are tight and so are the beats u'll be bobbin ur head to this..real gangsta music u can cruise or smoke too..... TEN StarzZz
4,Cast Iron Skillet Review,American's Test Kitchen had recommended this product. The skillet itself has a very minor inperfection along the edge of the skillet lip - should not be an issue.
4,Van never sold out,"This is another solid release by Van Morrison, as are most of his last cd's (What's wrong with this picture, Days like these, Down The road,...) where Van does what he knows best. ""Celtic New year"" is a celtic flavored song, and one of the best in this CD, although if you have heard his previous releases he has done it all before. It is not better, still it's a great song. Then he does some more jazzy song, and also the catchy repetitive ""They sold me out"", again about the commercialisation of music, he's done that theme before. ""Keep medicority at bay"" is more bluesy, with harmonica and all, and so on...Nothing really new, but the cd made me happy, as it will make most of his long time fans.I would not recommend this cd as the first Morrison CD - Start by Moondance, astral weeks, or the jazzy Veedon fleece, the 70's seem to be his classic period, or later ""No method no guru no teacher"" or ""poetic champion composes"", you see there are quite a few cd's to buy before this one.Enjoy."
1,"Van not the ""comeback man"" and this ain't magic...","I used to be the world's BIGGEST Van Morrision fan. That was in 1970s...and '80s...and even the early to mid '90s. But Van has lost ""the magic"", and this CD, bought in great anticipation after reading a number of good reviews elsewhere, is just another disappointment. The songs (with one or two exceptions) are all clunkers. The same tired, simplistic structure; weaknesses amplified by Van's late-life tendency to mostly shout his lyrics instead of sing them. Poor to simplistic arrangements (he hasn't had decent horns on a CD since the song ""Russian Roulette"" off ""Days Like This"") and lackluster musicianship make matters worse. I can't find a redeeming reason to purchase this CD and it pains me to say so, but Van has lost it and unlike peers Steve Winwood & Santana (amongst others), it doesn't appear any future redemption is in sight. In a word: AVOID."
5,"Still , One of The Very Best","Sensitivity , charisma , good music and lyrics , always with the times and space . Magic Time fills me with Hope and Joy in a World Gone Mad ( We are all Animals anyway ... ) Just keep on Van and we will all be happy to Be ... Enlightnment is where is at , it's up to you , What do you Think ? ... Well , we know what I think ..."
4,A must see for movie buffs and Star Trek fans.,"Many may not know that Captain Hornblower was actually the inspiration for Star Trek's Captain Kirk. In this movie you can see many similarities, and some notable differences. In some ways Peck's Hornblower is more like the later Captain Picard. Watch again the TNG episode ""The Naked Now"" and see Patrick Stewart's ""Hrrrumm"" tribute to this little-known bit of Star Trek History. E-mail me for more details."
1,Sent me the wrong DVD!,This company sent me the 1950's Three Musketeers movie in the Hornblower sleeve. Tried to contact them twice and never heard back.
5,Wonderful movie,"If you follow the books, this follows the story of ""Beat to Quarters"" and is played perfectly by Gregory Peck. It is certainly a must watch if you followed the A&E miniseries or the books. (or both)"
4,"Pretty Good ""Buckle your swash"" movie..!","This is not one of Pecks best roles, but serves fairly well as an action adventure story. Mayo is OK but has never been a very good actress. She adds a certain romance to the movie but her role could have been left out.Lots of action, cannons blasting, and swordplay. If you liked ""Captain Blood"" and ""Black Swan"" then you'll like this movie. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, Peck leads the British to victory over the French. 4 out of 5 stars. If you like ""swashbucklers"" then get the set of ""Horatio Hornblower"" starring Ioan Gruffudd that aired on A&E; TV......it's a better story and a lot better setting. Better acting, too."
1,Really awful,"I gave up on it twice. Wooden actors, horrible interpretation of hornblower. Absolutely no comparison to the british mini series from several years back. Never could sit all the way through this. Typical 1950s cheese."
3,"Sorry, his best work was with Capitol in the 50's","I find the Reprise work to be of lower quality when compared to the work Sinatra did in the 50's.Some gems here, but a lot of the songs have a mawkish, almost desperate element to them as Sinatra struggles with growing old. Also, too many of the arrangements are heavily weighted with strings...the music just doesn't swing like his earlier work."
3,it's ok,Not as much fun as I thought it would be. Takes too long to gather materials to build things. You spend more time running around than doing anything.
4,Great game - but beware!,"I won't get into the gameplay as it's already covered by the other reviewers. However, this is real important, if you don't live alone or expect to have other members play Castaway on the Wii, do not get this version. There is only 1 saved game allowed to be running at a time. Why EA was unable to program it where other save positions were allowed is beyond me. But I could not find away around this. And if you're wondering it does say this under ""Saving"" in the instruction book.Good game, but we had to take it back because all 3 of us wanted the ability to play separately."
3,They work but not as advertised,"I choose these because they claimed to be multicoated. I already have many uncoated diopters. I don't even think that these are coated at all. These are very nice otherwise, but disappointing to me."
2,What a disappointment!,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from the title of this book. There is nothing ""unofficial"" about the information it contains. The hotel descriptions are very standard guidebook material - lots of facts, but not enough of a description to give you a feel of the properties. I have stayed at several of the properties listed in this book and they could have easily included some information that IMHO would have been crucial to your enjoyment. Also, very little information is provided on things to do on each island outside of the usual tourist attractions. Maybe I am being too harsh. After all, Frommers and Fodors aren't any better, but since this book is touting itself as the ""unofficial guide"", I feel that it's a bit of false advertising."
3,It's pretty good.,"The main issue we have with this is getting a valid outdoor temperature. This is a replacement for The Weather Channel clock/weather forecaster. I love the projected display but can't seem to get the outdoor sensor in a good spot to give an accurate temperature. It seems to be much more limited in the distance it can be away from the base than our prior device, thus it must be too close to the house and gets too much house heat."
2,First-Time Skiers Only!,"The book was too simple for my tastes. I have been skiing for about a year and most of the information was way below my ""beginner"" level. There is really very very little information on actual skiing. The book basically covers the snow plow and simple turns as related to your ski lessons. There were some interesting tidbits in the book but on the whole I found it very lacking. If you have never ever been skiing and know absolutely nothing about it then the book might be helpful....but if you have skiied once in your life I don't think it will be that much more helpful."
1,Trash !!,Do not buy this item. I've bought 2 and both of them leak dish detergent all over the place. A waste of money.
3,works fine for me,"I like to stick with what I know and I've been using these for a few years now. In my opinion, they work perfectly fine. These scrubbers only leak if you store them with the sponge end pointing down or sideways. Store them upright and there's no leakage."
1,Pass on this waster,I bought two of these on sale and what a mistake. A total waste of money. The concept is a good one but this wastes dish soap like crazy!! I thought the first one was defective so I tried the second one I bought and the same story. Way too much soap. I never even press the button and it dispenses way to much. Don't fill it with soap and it's not a half bad scrubber. But don't waste your money here. 3M....... you should be ashamed for marketing this! I only gave it one star because the system wouldn't allow me to do ZERO.
5,best,"very good, music is clear and good song. the enigma is very well and olso the D- Emotion. l'impronta di Enigma è presente in tutto il Cd ed assieme a D-Emotion ne è uscito una melodia ricercata e pulita"
4,Good and Very Strong,"I threw away my old non-stick skillet after the coating wore out. and now I don't have any problems with this one. I don't fry a lot but I tried it to fry eggs with little olive oil and no problems at all, I thought the cleaning will be really hard with the scrubbing but it wasn't..just use the right brush (harsh one) with hot water right after you finish cocking while it's still hot, it's just I find it way better and easier to get everything off the skillet. and just dry it right away and rub it with little oil and that's it. now I literally do all my cooking with two basic cookwares (this one and the Calphalon Triply Stainless 2-1/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan with Glass Lid) and I love them.Calphalon Triply Stainless 2-1/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan with Glass Lid"
1,Disappointed,"Do not buy this squeegee! I purchased it for my shower and though it looks nice, the rubber portion is much too hard for its purpose. Totally disappointed... could not use it with any decent results so I threw it in the garbage."
2,Blade Too Short,I got this one to use on a shower door after house guests broke my original squeegee. The price was right but the blade is too short and too hard to fully dissipate the water. You're better off spending a little more for a silicone blade.
5,"Great product, New lid design is great.","When you buy Hayward, you know you will get a product that was made for pools, by pool people and wasn't a old stolen design that another company just copied to put a chlorinator on the Market. I bought a knock off chlorinator and had to return it twice because it was faulty. You get what you pay for the first time with this hayward chlorinator."
1,"what the heck is ""Nature and Nature Identical Flavors""","what the heck is ""Nature and Nature Identical Flavors""-- the soup sounds excellent except for that bit of subterfuge jargon; if you are afraid to list the real ingredients... here's a great idea--don't add it to the soup...!"
3,"6 Literary Classics, 2 Good Films","I wouldn't waste my money on this set. '3 Musketeers', 'Madame Bovary', and 'Captain Horatio Hornblower' are mediocre 'Hollyweed products'. The only worthwhile films are 'Billy Budd' and 'Prisoner of Zenda'. So my own recommendation is to purchase these 2 seperately. Personally I found '3 Musketeers' probably the worst interpretation of all time (with the exception of the Charlie Sheen version, of course) with Gene Kelly and June Allyson woefully miscast. 'Hornblower' is just plain dull, and I have seen 'Bovary', but have no memory of it, which says something about the film. This is one of the few times I would recommend the later versions of these stories, with Richard Lester's 'Musketeers'and the A&E Hornblower series being far superior to the films here."
3,I CAN BUY THIS CHEAPER AT THE UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE,WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON? THE UNIVERSITY IS THE LAST PLACE I WOULD EXPECT TO GET THE BOOK CHEAPER. DO YOU CHARGE S&H ON TOP OF THIS TOO? I CAN GET THE BOOK FOR $81 DOLLARS TODAY.
4,Why only hardcover edition?,"I like this book and have been reading it since 1985. I would be very pleased,if I am able to buy the student series edition, which is much cheaper than hardcover and practical. Why don't you supply also this edition?"
5,Every new mother needs the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"My sister-in-law recommended this swing to me and I am glad that I listened to her!!!!!I highly recommend the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing for all new mothers!!!! My daughter who is now 3 months old spends many hours a day in her swing, she loves to look up at the lights and the fish and she loves the music too!!! I let my daughter fall asleep in the swing every night before I put her in her bassinette. This is the best gift that I could have ever gotten, my dauther is very content in the swing!!!"
4,Though a life-saver too big!,"This swing was bought for us as a shower gift that we did not register for, however, it turned out to be one of our favorite things we recevied. This is a great swing with the two different directions, and different settings for music. However, there are cons to this swing...our son loves it and we cannot transport it anywhere without taking it apart. It takes up a lot of room and the swinging motion can swing to high for small babies. I would want it again but make sure you have something portable as well!"
1,Swing of Horrors,"I was given the swing at my baby shower so it was available for use from day one. My newborn son, a two weeks, was nearly thrown out of the seat. He weighed 9lbs at birth so he diffinetly met weight requirments. I havent noticed a difference in speed from the 6 settings, they all go entirely too fast for newborns. The mobile and light display is not entertaining for my son either, he will glance at it, but could care less about its existence. With the loud motor, fast speed, over-rated 'aquarium' display, I'd have to recommend you purchase a differnt swing."
2,Slow Down,"I think this is a great swing....but not for a newborn. I put my son in it when he was 1 month old and I felt as if the swing was going to thrown him out of it. I am not sure if the swing is broken but all the speeds are exactly the same...there is no difference between the first speed and the last speed, they are all equally fast. I think this swing will come in handy when my son is a little older."
5,Great present,"Gave this as a present for a new mom of twins. The mom loved it so much, she bought another one for the other twin!"
5,The best swing EVER!,"This swing is one of my son's favorite things. I absolutely love the cradle feature, the fish and globe, & the amazing power it has to soothe my son! Sometimes nothing will calm him down-once he sits in his swing, he is almost immediately quiet and delighted. He loves staring at the lights and fish. It was a bit fast at first, but we simply draped a blanket off of the seat and it slowed the swing down. He's now 14 weeks and loves it.The only 2 drawbacks are:I don't like how most Ocean Wonder items are on a short timer. I'm constantly resetting it.I wish the tray lifted up instead of having to completely remove it.Other than that, I LOVE this swing! He has a few other ones (at work and a take-along) he doesn't like so much. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good item to have,"My son wasn't sure about the swing at first, but within a week he grew to love it. He takes naps in it, loves to watch the fish go around and listen to the music, and can stare at the side panel of fish for a long time. It did go too fast for him in the beginning, but you can tie a bottle of water or something heavy to the back of it to slow it down. He doesn't seem to care that the motor does make a noise so not a problem. The biggest drawback- he's only 3 months old and his shoulders are already getting too wide for the seat! Also, be prepared to buy a lot of batteries if you use it often. Overall I'm glad we purchased it. =UPDATE= Beware: if your child has neck problems do not put them in a swing, bouncer, etc for long periods of time! We found out the hard way and need to fix the flat spot on our child's head."
2,There are better swings out there..,"I really don't like this swing! Even after putting brand new batteries in the swing, it still takes forever for it to start swinging. We have to prime it by pushing it!! I hate that the mobile and music stop after a certain time because it has a tendency to wake my daughter up when it stops since she is lulled to sleep with the noise. Other then that I like that it has 2 swinging directions."
2,Great swing that breaks!,"We received this swing as a gift for our daughter a year and a half ago and she used it with great pleasure. I like the features of the swing although it is HUGE and takes up a great deal of space in the room. However, when we got it out again for our second child after being stored well for a year, it has broken within a month. The mobile (which both kids loved) broke and the Fisher Price people won't replace it since it has been over a year. We either have to spend $30 to replace it or buy a new one. Seems like a company as large as Fisher Price would stand up for their product for over a year."
5,A Must Have,"I received this swing as a gift at my baby shower and left it in the box until my son was three weeks old. He was very fussy and nothing was calming him down, so I quickly put the swing together, which took about 45 minutes. Within five minutes of placing him in the swing, my son was sound asleep! He just loves it - I recommend it as the #1 must have ""toy"" for new moms!"
5,The swing to have,"I just love this swing. My daughter is 8wks old & has been using it since the day she came home. She loves watching the fish move around. We use the swing alot as I keep it in my kitchen. It is a great way to keep her entertained while I am doing dishes, cooking, or eating my meals. I love the option of the different music. I recommend this swing as the swing to buy."
4,"Great swing, but more bells and whistles than necessary","We have this swing, and it proved to be pretty handy when our daughter was a newborn. However, I think we could have been just as happy with another, smaller swing. We only used the cradle swing motion, so the fact that it has 2 modes of swinging were lost on us. The music/sounds do stop after about 10 minutes, which is just about the time my baby would be dozing off to the sounds....then wake up when they stopped. It is huge and although it ""folds"" for storage, it's still massive. The swing is inconvenient to move around the house. I wish we would have gotten a smaller, simpler, cheaper swing. I do really like the nature sounds on the swing and the moving fish have proven very entertaining for our baby. I would think that if your baby is comforted by the swinging motion, it wouldn't really matter which swing you decided to get."
4,Ugly swing but baby loves it!,"This swing really is quite dreadful looking (tacky blue fabric), so I put it in my home office instead of in the family room. But looks aside, my 12-week-old absolutely loves it. She is mesmerized by the colored lights and the sound of the waves.We have the Baby Papasan swing in the other room, and this is basically the same design with different sounds and a different mobile. But I have to say she likes the aquarium one better. She just smiles and coos at the colored lights. It is adorable!"
4,sanity saver,"Got this swing after a disappointing trial with the ""Rainforest"" swing. Swings fast enough and is entertaining enough for our fussy boy. Music on it is decent (for a baby swing)and has volume control, cute design with gentle lights that catches his interest, can swing front to back or side to side. Only four stars because it doesn't plug in, the top doesn't swing up out of the way for putting baby in & out, and the seat is only one position (only reclined, can't sit-up). Small grievances for the ability to make a sandwich or go to the bathroom without a screaming baby in the background. Will recommend to my new mommy pals."
5,Lifesaver,"Yes - it is bulky, takes up a lot of space, a nightmare to transport and takes FOREVER to get to a decent swing - but it has saved me LOTS of headache or should I better say back-ache from carrying our little guy around for hours...The great thing about this swing are really the fishies- - whenever he is awake and I really need a hand free, he swings happily talking to the fish without getting bored at all, and when he is tired it is just a matter of seconds for him to close his eyes. I never use the sounds and I find them very loud, the music is a little melancholic - neither a lullaby nor a happy-child-music. Well, I am glad it works for us even without the sounds."
5,LOVE IT,This swing is visually great...my baby loves it. He has fallen asleep many times and loves batting at the fish above him. He also plays with the little toys on the tray. The different types of music are awesome; he never gets bored. He is a special needs baby and will be in the swing longer than a typical baby and I am soooooo glad I purchased it.
5,Lifesaver,We've used this with our daughter since she was born. She falls asleep in it all the time. It's a little fast for small babies so I just draped a bath towel over her lap and let it drag the ground until she was 6 wks old (>12 lbs). I changed the batteries for the first time when she turned 2 months old. It's not a space-saver but it's worth it!
4,This is a great purchase!,"This was a great purchase for my baby. It has so many features that it keeps my daughter, who is now 6 months occupied for a while. The only down fall is that i have to change the batteries every two weeks, due to the fact that she loves it so much. I would reccomend this item to any parents, it's easy to assemble and very entertaining."
3,It swings way to fast!,"The look of the swing is perfect and handy. The main problem is it is not the right swing for a new born baby at all. It swing way too fast. I need to push it myself evey 2 minutes. Little kid is heavy enough for the designed speed. Even I use the slowest speed, it still make the baby cry because it is too fast."
1,Faulty from the beginning,"This swing didn't work properly from day one, the mobile broke first. It made a horrible grinding noise. We should've taken it back. We just kept the mobile off, then a few months later the music and lights started messing up. The switch on top has a short circuit or something. Now, it won't swing and play music at the same time. For $100 I thought it would be the best. Iwas very wrong. Maybe, the newer model has improved but I'd be weary."
1,Poor Quality,Piece of junk. Very noisy. Leg lifts off the ground when rocking. All six speeds are exactly the same speed. Poor quality. It's going back.
2,Great to not so good any more...3 months and it breaks down,"The swing was exactly what we wanted. We have had it for about 3 1/2 months. About a month ago the music started sounding like a skipping CD so I thought I must need to change the batteries. That didn't help at all. Now the sounds do not even work on a regular basis. If you thump the top of the machine it will start up for a second and then turn right back off. Also, my son loved the fish that would swim around over his head and now they have stopped working as well. He has been in this swing since he was about a month old so when ever he gets in it he always looks up to see the fish swimming but now they don't move. It makes me feel awful that something he liked so much from a very early stage has aready become a disappointment. This swing is supposed to last until age two?????? I don't think that is accurate. Now we are stuck with this broken thing because it has been too long of a time frame to return. Thanks Fisher Price."
5,One of the best gifts we recieved.,"We recieved this item for our baby shower. My husband was a little unsure of how our daughter would react in this swing. Turns out, it was the best item purchased for us. Our daughter is now 6 1/2 months old and still loves this swing. This is great for teaching your baby how to focus their eyes. Our daughter loves the globe, not to mention the lights and sounds. She didn't like to swing forward to backward until she was about 3 months but it didn't matter, she loves this swing and never cries in it. I have also found that if your baby is congested your pediatrician may recommend allowing your baby to sleep in this till they are well (this saved us quite a few sleepless nights). I can't say enough of positive things about this swing. I know many people who have them and none of them have any complaints either. In my opinion this is the only swing out there good enough for our little girl!"
3,What is Amazon thinking with this price???,"I'm not sure what is going on here. This is not $300 swing. Don't get me wrong, it is nice ... but even Babies r Us, which is usually more expensive than Amazon, is selling it for the regular price of $109.99. Amazon really needs to pay closer attention to the vendors it allows if it wants to keep business."
3,goes too fast,"My baby loves this swing, but i can't use the swing function because even on the lowest setting it goes way too fast. She only weighs 5 kilos but we tried it with an 8 kilo baby (which is almost the limit for this swing) and it still goes too fast on the lowest setting. Anyway, i agree with everything the other reviewer said in his pros and cons. The motor is loud, but the fish hypnotise the baby and she loves the lights changing color. It's very nice to have the variety of sound options (music, ocean waves, rain, etc). Also it is important that it is a ""cradle"" swing in the sense that a newborn baby can sit in a reclined position."
3,not bad for a little while,"I loved this swing when we first got it when my son was born. He Loved it too, the way it would go from cradle to regular swing was neet,and he loved to stare at the sea creature mobile and the sounds where nice too. It seemed to swing too fast on high, but it is ajustable. I did notice as the weeks went by the swing wasn't working so great as in the beginning. The motor got very loud and the music would start to sound funny. The mobile was loud too. It wasn't so easy to recline eather.I definantly went threw a lot of D batteries too. Now I am due for my second baby and the swing dosn't work at all! The motor makes a terrible noise and the swing dosn't swing. I don't recomend this swing if you plan on using it for long, and especially for a second time around!"
4,Like running into an old friend,"I recently became aware of Maura again while browsing Amazon & seeing that she's got a new release coming out this summer. I think this was the 1st CD of hers I bought many yrs ago & I love it still. All the tracks are good, but standouts include: Burning My own Rowboat, When your heart is weak, Ireland & her cover of Lennon-McCartney's For No One. I've seen her perform live several times over the yrs & even once had the privilege of meeting her. She's a great performer & a delightful person."
4,great for small projects,"My family asked what I wanted for Christmas, and I replied a sander, expecting an orbital or belt sander, useful for the many furniture refinishing projects I seem to get myself into time after time. What I got was this.It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand, and after even long periods, there's no pain from gripping it, only the numbness that comes from using any sander, sending the vibrations up my arm. It is, though, only useful for the small parts--the carved details of the molding, or in the corners where a regular sander can't reach. Despite following the picture instructions, I'm still not sure how to get the finger attachment to screw in, but that's probably just my own ineptitude... Even without, this sander has been extremely helpful, but I will still need to invest in a larger one for the projects that I do."
3,Ok...,I bought this for my daughter and she loved it! The only thing she didn't like about it is that the velcro started coming undone and the insulation did not work so I do not recommend this lunch box.
1,Very disappointed,I am very disappointed in this lunch bag. I bought it for my daughter and after only one month of school it has molded between the outside and the insulation inside. I will never purchase another product from sugarbooger again!!!
2,moldy,"This is the most adorable, excellent little lunch sack- except for the mold that has appeared between the lamination and fabric. Similar reviews indicate this is a common problem for this item. BUMMER! I will hate throwing it out. I will also hate having to buy a new one...and needless to say, it will be a different brand."
3,Cheap,"This looks very cheap in comparrison with the rest of the line. I suppose it does get the job done, so I gave it 3 stars. Generously."
4,Great service!,Item exactly as pictured/described; great quality; prompt shipping. I am very happy w/my purchase!
1,Very Disappointed,"This is a poor quality, made in China, product. It arrived damaged with sharp, as broken glass, chips around the rim of the pan. I won't be buying any other Sante Cabin/Camp Chef [or any other made in China] cast iron products.Sante Cabin Kitchen 14-Inch Pizza Pan"
1,God awful,"I hope the reviewer who said that Contour Design took care of their little problem was telling the truth... because mine's completely stuck and won't come out at all.If that wasn't bad enough, it scratched my player on the bottom while I slipped it in for the first time. This case also does not allow for some car kits and mini home players to connect to either, because of it's thickness.Believe me, I've seen a lot of cases for the ipod mini, and unfortunately got this one for my b-day... the worst one I've had to deal with for sure.Your choice, save your money or end up scathing your mini..."
4,another volume from gram and grams,a wonderful non text book for young people to begin to realize that they aren't the firsts to experience so many things in the world and that history can repeat itself.
5,"Great,","Even though condensed from a larger work. There are places where you want longer stretches of information, but it does the job, and Durant is always wonderful to read.Wonderful little tidbits all over: In 50 B.C, the poet Catullus complained, ""I must sprinkle my poems with filth to have them read."" Today, best selling authors sprinkle their filth with....ah...hum..."
1,History Lite,"This book is nothing more than selective edits from the Durant's History of Civilization. Which is fine, I understand the marketing motivation to sell more in whatever form (!). However, Heros of History should be advertised for what it is so that people who have already read the original books won't waste their money buying the same in a newly packaged form. This is basically Cliff Notes, or less, of History of Civilization. Cut and Paste."
5,Even Easier,"This is a great short version of the history of civilization by Will Durant who was probably the most outstanding historian/philosopher of the 20th century. If you would enjoy a review or a quick education, this is the book to read. I enjoyed it immensely. And, for an even easier education on what I would call the ""philosophy of history"", I know I enjoyed, and think you will also enjoy, Norman Thomas Remick's ""West Point: Character Leadership Education, A Book Developed From The Readings And Writings Of Thomas Jefferson""."
1,Not Helpful,"Writing is horribly obtuse; author goes on at =length=, building elaborate analogies and illustrations long before he ties it to any sort of useful point. The advice and strategy for ""finishing whatever you start"" doesn't actually =start= until chapter 10; almost halfway through the book! Assuming the reader has trouble following through with things (otherwise they wouldn't have picked up this book), the author should have started helping them sooner than chapter 10. The advice is far from ""revolutionary"". It rehashes techniques already written about with more clarity. Try Tony Robbins 'Awaken the Giant' for a clearer statement of 'personal leveraging', the classic Alan Lakein's 'How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life', or the more recent 'Getting Things Done' by David Allen."
4,"Good Book, but too Basic","This book is teeming with clear, color photos and diagrams. It is a good reference for performing routine electrical work.While the title purports it as including ""advanced projects"", however, almost all of the book is devoted to new installation work. An ""advanced"" book, in my opinion, should include more information on modernizing old wiring, and things to watch out for when modernizing, such as bad splices on knob & tube wiring, and even rewiring.This book is really not much different from dozens of other books out there, but it gets 4 stars for its clarity and reasonable price."
3,Alright... All Night,"While I do not have the exact album listed above, I have the original TRB TWO from back in the day. The entire disk is listenable, although some songs are edgy (its attraction!) such as Law & Order. Black Angel is an excellent gospel piece. On the whole, Tom's ragged voice lends a real rock sensibility to the issues of the day, of which many still hold true. An urban grittiness.Incidentally, I am recording my vinyl version onto CD, and came here for the Album art. The original TRB TWO is a dark orange cover, with the same black font, not the yellow shown here."
1,Total Garbage - You get what you pay for!,"I am amazed by all the positive reviews for this filter. This filter is total garbage! Dont believe me, check the horrible reflection it produces. My advice: STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Low Quality!,"Given the price, I was doubtful these would be good, but I was convinced by the two positive reviews. I was sorely disappointed! They felt pretty smooth out of the package, but after the first wash the fabric's true quality was revealed -- they were SCRATCHY and rough. (And not rough like nubby old cozy flannel - I mean like bristly.) This is because cheaper fabric is made from shorter fibers, and so the tiny ends poke out. You can actually feel them. Even the cheapest sheets from Ikea feel better than this!"
4,I liked it!!!,"Reviews are simply people's personal opinions, I thought this movie was great! I saw this movie with my teen daughter and her friend's. It makes me laugh and I have to wonder these people that bash movies on here have a ""real"" job or not!! Get a life! It's 1 1/2 hours of fun entertainment! The scares and ghouls in this movie had us girls screaming a few times! LOL Very fun!!"
4,One of the handles is broken,"One handle was broken when I received the oven. I found the updated handle larger and prettier but you see, so can't judge the look. I will have to settle with one handle oven."
3,Good and a half,"When the Performance soundtrack is on, its REALLY on. A lot of this 1970 film music features Ry Cooder's slide guitar, mining the rootsy sound Jagger's Stones personified so well onBeggars Banquet. Listen to Randy Newman's ""Gone Dead Train,"" or ""Memo From Turner"" by Jagger.The instrumentals here are ok, but are soft pieces that break the country blues feel of the strongest songs. It may have worked in the film, but the running order here fragments the album--grouping them by sound may have made this good album even better.If you like this, get the Stone'sMetamorphosisto hear a much faster, funkier version of ""Memo From Turner"""
3,Good history background.,"'Time of Fear' is a good background study of injustices that we have placed upon our own citizens. At lot of people in our country claim that they are mistreated by the masses. We usualy do not consider the injustices that our Japanese citizens were forced to indure at our governments hands. Of the few Japanese internment camps, two were located in Arkansas. Both were located in in the same general area of the state. The areas were not very suitable for the thousands of people in these camps. The Japanese proved to be very resourceful and survived the hardships of being interned. They actually improved the lands on which they were forced to remain. This would be a very good cd for all children that live in the state to view, so they may learn from injustes that we as a people inflict upon others."
1,Line Dancing,This video is not what I thought it would be. They take you through steps real quick and expect you to keep rewinding the tape to learn the dance steps. It really sucked. I would not recommend it to anyone.I thought they would have music that played the whole song after you learned the dance -- it would have been nicer at a slower pace.
5,One of the best blues 'live'albums!,"Undoubtedly,one of the best 'live'blues albums,ever released yet.Eric Clapton revisiting the roots,the early years,with phenomenal performance.A sensual,refined cd,for those that really love the best music! The most exciting in this work,is the silence of the audience at Albert Hall during the tracks! The sensation of peace,innebriates the air,and all we can do is listen...listen...listen.........and love...love...love....."
5,A Show of Style,"Eric Clapton is not the fastest guitarist around, he is not the most powerful. He certainly doesn't have a great voice. So what's to like? A lot, just in the guitar alone. The soloing is great and his style shows through in every note... this style is his fluidity and ease, particularly in various keys of soloing. For example some soloing bridges on neoclassical, which is not heard often from Clapton but he finely executes here."
4,"Sorry, not Eric's best live. . .","That honor goes to Live At the Fillmore with the Dominos. Even Just One Night and EC Was Here are much better than this. The blues section of disc one is the only real reason to own this. If only this were two cd's worth of that material. And the Cream covers are technically superb (this IS Clapton after all) but decline into bombast obviously calculated to sound impressive on FM airplay. Disc two is an unfocused mess, too many abrupt style changes and an embarrassingly horrible version of Bell Bottom Blues. Only ""Hard Times"", with tasty piano from veteran Chuck Berry sideman Johnnie Johnson redeems here."
2,Es un video no un concierto.,"Si esperas ver un concierto, no te gustara este DVD. Es un vulgar doblage, (lipsinging). Las canciones no estan del todo mal, pero me molesta sobre manera que pormocionen este DVD como un concierto en vivo, cuando en realidad el tipo lo que esta es doblando."
4,Great knife,I love this knife. It slices through chicken filets like butter and chops veggies to perfection. This knife runs circles around my old henkels.
3,"Great knife, but dulls quickly.","This is a great knife (weight, balance, etc) but it seems to dull quickly despite the fact that it is rarely used on anything more than fruit and veggies. Don't buy it unless you are willing to invest in a sharpener to go with. The one on the back of our automatic can opener seems to work great. DO NOT use an automatic sharpener with this knife. Three to four strokes on a manual sharpener does a perfect job. An automatic will take too much metal off."
5,One of my favorite cooking tools!,"I've had this knife for 4 years now, and it still looks like I bought it yesterday. I sharpen it ever three uses or so, as recommended on the packaging, and I use it pretty much every day. It cuts things beautifully and without hesitation - I'm not sure what I would do without it!"
5,This is a great mulyi-purpose knife,"We have many of fine German knives in our kitchen but this one is our all time favorite. We grab this little gem any time we need a handy knife to do a quicky job. When you want to slice a few radiches for a salad, make a sandwich or whatever small job you have, this is the knife you will go to time and time again.We also use our 8"" Chef's knife when we are getting dinner ready, but a lot of times it is just too big for what you need. That's when this knife shines through.And of course it's from Wusthof so you know it is the best.We love it."
5,"7"" Chefs Knife","I am a novice cook who was tired of the cheap stamped knives I got from my wedding. I discovered Wusthof knives at a friends house and have been hooked since. I bought this because the price was too good to pass up and I have been very happy with it. The knife is comfortable in my hand, I prefer the Classic handle over the Grand Prix. I like the heft of the Wusthof chef's knives compared to their competition. I bought this as a secondary knife as I normally use the 10"" classic but it has come in handy when I am preparing several things at once or when my wife needs to use a knife, she likes the smaller 7"".If you are someone who is buying their first knife do what I did, go to the store and hold all of the knives to determine which one you like, then purchase online for the best price."
2,Disappointing,"First, it's misnamed: although there are several scenic multi-day walks depicted, about half the locations visited are drive-up tourist destinations like the Taj Majal. Second, the writing is uninspired, with the narrator intoning generic phrases like, ""It is one of the most spectacular views in the world"" for virtually every location - you get the sense they could have put some of the narration behind any of the locations and it would have made no difference. I watched it through a couple of times and donated it to a library."
2,This book should be condenced to just a magazine article.,"The title to this book can be verry misleading, chances are anyone with enough ambition to build a motorcycle, already knows the basics that this book covers, if you are looking for power hungry tech info, this book will let you down for sure. This book would however make a great part one of a two part book, C'mon Timothy Remus, where's part two?"
1,WELL TEHN HOW DO YOU BUILD ONE,THIS BOOK WAS VERY BORING! AND RELLY DIDEN'T COVER HOW TO ACTULY BULID A BIKE. TIM REMUS JUST RAMBLES ON ABOUT CERTIN PARTS OF A BIKE AND WHAT THEY DO.AND HOW YOU PICK PARTS FOR YOUR BIKE. IT DID HAVE SOME INTRESTING TIPS BUT NOTHING SPECIAL ENOUGH TO EVEN TALK ABOUT (I;LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT) I RECOMMEND LOOKING AT IT AT THE BOOK STORE THEN PUTTING IT BACK ON THE SHELF.
3,Latin soundtrack,This is a pure Step video in Spanish with a latin music soundtrack. This is the program that is shown on ESPN. There are no Salsa steps in it. It is still an enjoyable mild dance exercise video.
1,low quality,"All 4 glasses developed cracks within 2 months time. they look nice but I was extremely disappointed with the quality, especially since the other items that match in the set were of good quality."
4,Great glasses!,"These are great, especially since they were a freebie with my dish set purchase. I'm giving the item 4 stars versus 5, as it would have been nice if they were a bit larger. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Gets to those hard to reach spots between the shoulder blades!,Totally worth it! This is great for really working out the knots in my upper back! This is so much better than standing against a wall with a tennis ball trying to roll out the knots :)
4,Coolest Thing EVER,"I bought this for Christmas for a friend with chronic back pain. When he raved about it, I decided to try it for myself. WOW. This thing is amazing! I have MS, and I frequently have muscle spasm and stiffness that require some pretty heavy duty meds to unlock, but this thing can really take the edge off in no time. I spent the entire weekend before this arrived unable to turn my head and in extreme pain. When it showed up I put it to use, and literally after 3 minutes the Thera Cane helped more than all the muscle relaxants and back rubs from my husband did for 2 days. I am seriously sold on this! My only gripe is the cost, which is a bit high. Still, it's worth it!"
5,Pain Free,"While it is weird at first to use the theracane, it takes no more than five minutes to get the hang of it and the results are amazing. It is able to get all the kinks out!"
5,Getting rid of the hard to reach sore spots,"I have problems with tight neck muscles and back muscles from working out with weights; I was spending a lots of money on massage therapy until my a physical therapist told me about the Theracane. It has been a life saver (and money saver). Now I can give myself a deep massage on my neck, shoulder and back muscles, then take a hot shower and I'm back in business. This was a great investment for me!!!"
4,Item/Shipping review,"The item is useful and my physical therapist recommended it. My only suggestion would be the concern I had with the shipping. The package was torn apart---papers that were enclosed gone---did manage to get the book (thank goodness) but the post office sent a dirty, torn paper under separate cover wherever it had been found. I would suggest a better packaging option for future shipments!"
3,one size for all people = not great fit,one size for all people = not great fitshould make a large one for those with shoulders 4 ft wide..
4,great!,"Have chronic myofascial back pain. Have tried the tennis ball in the sock, lying on a ladel, etc. as recommended by PT or massage therapists- they help a bit but can't get right pressure to the knots like I need. This works great- simple to use, allows me to put just the right pressure in just the right spots. Certainly does not replace professional massage, but nice for in between sessions."
5,Thera Cane Message,"After using my daughter-in-law's cane while visiting her in CA I know I needed one of my own. I have had muscle pain for many years on my left shoulder blade. It times it would get so bad that I would not be able to turn my neck from side to side. Being able to use the Therma cane by myself is wonderful. Each night I sit on the edge of a chair or the bed and massage my back to take out all of the tension and massage the sore muscles around the shoulder blades. The Terma Cane has given me back the movement to turn my heck from side to side with out pain. Because you can use the Therma Cane by yourself and get the relief you would get from a deep message, it is the best product I have found that really works for me."
3,Useful,"The Thera Cane is useful in getting to places that are difficult alone and I have followed the instructions and watched the DVD. That being said I haven't found it to be very useful is reducing the pain I have had in my upper back, neck and shoulders. It feels good as you work the area but in the long term I have not seen it's effectiveness."
4,positive help,"the cane helps the pain, i had been using a tennis ball, the cane makes it easier to fined the pressure points, i learned not to do the points so long , with the cane a little pressure is all it takes, if in pain this does help. i am obese so this is one way to reach the points without help"
4,Interesting Product,"This product is interesting to me. Maybe I don't know how to use it very well, but I can't see how this would offer ""fixes"" to my issues. I frequently have tons of back pain and neck pain. This product feels great kneading my back. I've been using it every day to knead my back for 30-45 minutes. I come away feeling pretty good, but the back pain is still there, just not so irritating. I guess what I'm getting at is this isn't some miracle tool that will fix your aches and pains. I'm going to have to make some lifestyle changes I'm sure, just not really sure where to start. If you have aches, and you don't mind spending a decent portion of your day rubbing your own back, this tool is nice. I find that standing up is the easiest way to get at my shoulder blades. I have tried using it on my neck, but the plastic nubs that you're supposed to use have sharp edges because of the way the cane is made (manufacturing flaw). I would recommend this product."
5,A seriously deep massager,"A seriously deep massager. I have a chronic problem of my lower back. I spent $50 for chiropractic or $35 for body massage each week to ease my back pain. I was skeptical before buy Thera Cane Massage because I wandered how a ""stick"" can relieve the pain of my stiff muscle. But I am glad I was wrong and I can't live without now. It does work and it gives me a better sleep since then. After using it for couple weeks, I have to press my muscle harder with Thera Cane Massager. Don't get me wrong...my back pain is getting better so I have to press harder to reach the sour spot."
5,Second one,Loaned by Thera Cane to nextdoor neighbor when she had some back spasms. Decided to let her keep old one and I got a new one.
3,No User Manual As Advertised - Disappointing.,"Product was advertised as ""Includes 14-page customer user manual"" but did not come with anything.Just the cane in a box. That was a little disappointing."
5,Baritone Heaven,"This album was released in 1974, along with the 15th anniversary edition of ""What is There to Say."" The latter album was first released, that year, in true stereo. It had only been available in mono. The way I figure it, I have listened to it in mono about 500 times, and in stereo about another 500 times.""Idol Gossip"" is great. Gerry sings. Gerry talks (17 minutes). Gerry plays ""Waltzing Matilda,"" the #1 most beautiful jazz recording of ALL TIME. He does it in four parts. The first part is a funeral dirge. The second part is the most beautiful waltz that I've ever heard. The third part is a twist! Get it? It's a body twisting at the end of a rope. The fourth part is funky, 4-4 time. That is also known as ""jazz"" time or ""blues"" time. The guy who was going to be hanged, jumped into the water and drowned himself. He had the blues in a big way."
2,Boring ... a big disappointment.,"As much as i respect Ian Irvine's effort in writing this book i have to say that, ""A Shadow on the Glass,"" is a big disappointment. I have read many fantasy novels by numerous authors and none of them not even the worst of them was as bad as this one was. For example, Ian goes on and on describing the surroundings in so, so much detail that made me feel dizzy and sleepy! Then there is this problem of stretching the story of one character for so long! He talks about Karan and her confrontation with the Whelms chapter after chapter after chapter! I thought it'll never end! Excitement level = Zero. I threw the book away just before reaching half way because i got so bored. It just didn't have the ""It grabbed me from the start"" element."
1,"A movie,where everthing is boring !!!","Very ,very,,very ,very very Very ,very,,very ,very very ,Very ,very,,very ,very very Very ,very,,very ,very very .VERY VERY VERY,VERY,BORING !BORING"
5,Emotional love between men without labels.,"I bought this dvd based on customer reviews and enjoyed it very much. After you view the dvd with friends, talk about it and get their reaction. My gut feeling was that neither of the two male characters had ever felt, or experienced, love toward another man until they met. This was a beautiful, well done motion picture. What a shame that 'Priscila, Queen of the Desert' gets mass release and this wonderful film about male bonding is only available to those who search for it. This film is about homosexualtiy and not about being gay (have you seen a gay pride parade or festival?). The beauty of the film is the male bonding. I loved it."
3,Southern Love story,"Timeless Southern story of madness, love, fidelity, commitment, heartbreak and endurance, in short life itself, in the raw!"
3,Better ways to spend your time.,"It seems most of the reviewers here either love this movie or hate it with a passion. I fall right in between. The lead was cute, but that didn't carry the movie. The cinematography was very good. The acting was mired by over-the-top fake southern accents (that thankfully, at least some of the time, the actors forgot to use.) At least Lee sounded authentic.The dialog was awful (""we're of the same flesh"", give me a break. Who says that?) Despite all that, I did get drawn into the romance. Alas, the ending was a big disappointment. I certainly wouldn't buy this movie. In fact, I just ""Netflix""'d it so it didn't even cost me as much as a rental. If you're faced with an evening of either watching this movie, or flipping channels for 2 hours, I guess the movie is marginally better and you can always freeze frame the nude shots for a little bit of a 'wake up' as the story slowly plods along."
4,History I never knew,"I rented this at Blockbuster and I thought this was a good show. There is not much video of the actual ships as there was in the Titanic show. But the history lesson is a good one and the personal recollections of the several survivors held one's interest and compassion. I was not aware that there were over 20,000 souls lost when these 3 ships were sunk in WWII."
4,They almost got it right.,"This would be a good solid addition to anyone's collection who loves mid 70's to late 80's country music, but they missed in a couple of ways; first they left off one of (if not THE) very best song of his career ""Devil In The Bottle"". In my mind, they could have left off ""Somewhere Down the Line"" or ""Finally"" and put ""Devil"" on there and it would have rated five stars."
1,Don't Buy it,"In all the world i cannot see why someone would want this game, unless you just HAVE to have a football game for your original Gameboy. If the orignal Gameboy is your most current system then i would suggest you get a new one."
3,the presence,i enjoyed this book very much. It was a good read. Didn't want to put it down. I love old castles and ghosts stories
4,"Excellent bowl, but a little pricey","I bought this bowl to raise bread dough in, and it is definitely large enough and heavy enough for that purpose. My only regret is the price--I have entire sets of mixing bowls that didn't cost this much!"
5,A personal favorite.,One of my personal favorites. The alternate takes of Jazz Band Ball included on the CD are better than the original LP version.
2,Not Good!,"This game isnt good. I've never played the old version, but this certainly isnt much fun...a fetus could win it, and its boring.The music in this game is decent though. I'd say this is a good kids' game but for older folks it stinks."
3,"An ok book for beginners, but.....","This book is good if you're a beginning C++ programmer or if you're a C programmer with no knowledge of MFC (Microsoft foundation classes). The book is easy to read and the samples work. Most samples follow a ""step by step"" programming guide. The book is well over 1400 pages, but atleast 600 of them are useless( typical step over pages ). After you have completed a sample the book lists all the code from the sample (with generated MFC code), this listing of code is in my opinion a complete waste. The code can be found on the cd and if you typed the sample you already have all the code. The book doesn't cover anything about COM, oleDB, or ATL which is a little disappointing considering this is a book with over 1400 pages. The editor probably paid the authors for the weight of the book. There are probably better books on VC++."
3,Too much wizardry.,"The first few chapters are a great overview of C++, but after that I became quickly disenchanted with the direction of the instruction. The text jumps directly to using wizards to perform all of your MFC needs. The author freely admits that this is his intent which made this book the wrong one for me. Maybe I will continue reading it once I have mastered the connection between the API and the MFC by means of a different book. If wizards are what you seek, this may be a utopic tome for you..."
4,Excellent portable workbench,"This is my second workmate work bench. I use them both, usually at the same time. I often clamp a thick 2x2 ft piece of plywood to the top of one of them so I can drill without damaging the workmate if I drill too deep. The workmate is great as a portable workbench. I move them around my tiny work space and fold them up against the wall when not in use. The wheels are somewhat superfluous. The plastic cog inserts on the table top for clamping are handy for quick work but are not very precise. Clamps are better. The workmate does what it was designed for very well."
4,Don't notice it,"This filter slipped right on my lens. It seems solid, but most importantly I haven't noticed it while taking photos, which means it's doing its job just fine for me."
5,GREAT,I bought this for my mom and she uses it all the time in the kitchen! It's really helpful for crushing garlic or spices or making guacamole
4,Great experience of the rural west.....,"The thing I always enjoy about Hemingway isn't his stories, it's his cadence and use of language. I enjoyed this book in much the same way. The story takes place in a working-class small town in eastern Colorado, and Haruf weaves the lives of citizens young and old in ways that all with small-town experience will recognize. The story doesn't feel as though it has any destination in mind, but the journey is what I enjoyed anyway. I'd love to see what any respectable freshman English professor would do to Haruf's dialogue (C+ with a ton of red-lines I'm sure), yet that is what allows the reader to experience rather than observe the community that Haruf has created.I listed to this book without reading Plainsong (the first in the series) without feeling overly lost. I have already ordered Plainsong for my queue."
2,This game wasn't tested before being brought to market,"In what should have been a fun challenge, the result is very frustrating. The makers of this game rushed it to market before the bugs were worked out. There are several errors and nonfunctioning elements, like many ""visual clues"" that are nothing but white boxes, where the image is completely missing. The experience is a big disappointment. In the Final Jeopardy segment, a mere 5 seconds are given in which to enter the question. That is a huge error in programming. At other times the game goes to the theme song without finishing the game being played. Save your money for a fully functioning game."
1,Save your money. Don't get this.,"I bought 2 copies of Customer Manager for my office. It worked pretty well at first until you sync it. It messes up Quickbooks. Contacts had their own Quickbooks customer accounts. In so many words, double entry. Made tracking very difficult. It also screwed up Outlook when it was syncing with that too. I can't even uninstall it now. Save your money and just use the notes feature in Quickbooks to work on."
1,I thought 2.0 was bad,"I have used this upgrade for about four months now. The biggest piece of junk ever. I had 2.0 and had problems. The customer service person talked me into upgrading to 2.5. Now my databases in both Quickbooks and customer manager are all messed up. They combine random people together or totally change a group of customers to list them by first name. How great when you have 25 Johns, etc. I use the calender for contacting customers when they are due for service. It has messed this up so bad that I am constantly missing names on my list and it tells me a customer is due for service when it isn't. At least with 2.0 it kept things more organized. I wish I would have stuck with that, and it was bad enough. It just gets worse with time."
5,Fascinating and Instructive,"Completed this book two summers back during a quick study of the Horn of Africa---and as an arm-chair law buff found the author's work extraordinary in scope and import. Instead of the usual soft racism that derides much of African culture and heritage, Mr. Van Notten offers real alternatives to traditional Western legal remedies/methods---with added benefits of examining the legal/economic constraints of Somali custom/law. A first rate read and highly recommend to those interested in innovative alternatives to traditional Western jurisprudence."
1,"Bad, unpleasant film","LUMINOUS MOTION is the kind of mess that just can't escape certain people who praise it because it's so ""offbeat"" and ""different"" and ""low key"". Yes, it is all three of those and I myself certainly like something offbeat, different and low key in my movies too. However, those qualities don't necessisarly translante into ""Good"".And LUMINOUS MOTION is definitely NOT a good or even OK film. In fact, it's pretty bad. It's not that it's badly acted...Eric Lloyd is very good. The film goes way overboard with the ""motion"" theme, pummeling it to death. People also apparently don't mind that this boy ends up doing some pretty nasty things in this movie. It left me feeling empty and depressed with hardly anyone likable or redeeming in it. The movie rambles on and on with occasional fringes into the surreal. Surreal stuff like this is tricky to handle, and LUMINOUS MOTION can't get a handle on it."
5,Desperately seeking this movie,I have been looking for this movie for my 6 year old daughter for her birthday and it is impossible to find. We both love it. I watched it when I was little. She likes the way the girls sing and dance and all get along together. If anyone has the where abouts of this movie please send me and email. Thank you.
4,quite interesting specialized book,"for traders who use option selling strategies this is one of the few books available, because the commun bias toward selling options is generally negative. The authors take a very strong position about the convenience to sell options and this is encouraging. Very interesting is the idea about seasonality and they perfectly illustrate why this factor is so relevant. Also brilliant is the review of the different selling options available because every trader can have a specific inclination towards one of them. What I was expecting was a chapter dedicated to how to build a plan for selling options. Pity one cannot find this issue in the book"
3,Not what I expected but ok read,"The book basically only discusses how to sell far OTM options. Was expecting more a market maker perspective, how to hedge/manage your greeks/adjust your positions etc.Having said that, the book offered some interesting insights and the strategy actually works reasonably well.Half of the book is a discussion of various commodities market which isn't very useful to everyone (at least to me as equities guy)."
2,Men's Minnetonka Moccasins,The Moccasins were received very promptly. When the catalog suggests that Moccasin sizes run small you should pay attention and really believe that. Attention should also be paid to the term Ruff Leather as that means a couple grades more coarse than a suede finish.
5,Superb holiday movie!!,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is a great holiday movie with a superb theme and ever better acting/storyline that you rarely see on broadcast TV anymore. My only addition, even though I this Amazon does a great job with prices - this movie is available from the Hallmark Hall of Fame website for $20."
1,PLEEZE! BORING!,"beach head 2002 [stinks]. dont buy it. wow, a few new guns, but they all sound the same. Also, nigh-fighting is cool, but gets extremely repative. in fact, the whole game is extremely repetive. dont buy it. the new M60 is cool, and so is the vulcan, but they have the same rate of fire. if you have seen the movie predator, the vulcan in that movie sounds like a vacuum cleaner and in the game: 1. It fires no faster than the M60. 2. Is has the same amount of stopping power. ..."
2,Made in China poorly!,"We have the entire set of Phaltzgraff French-Quarter dishes, including the small salt/pepper shakers. There are several things wrong with this piece. The measurements are incorrect and this bowl is only two inches deep, not four as indicated in the ad. The multi-colored side stripe is not straight and the bowl wobbles due to the base being misformed. Very poor workmanship. We would have given it one star but it does not leak, yet! The dishes do not stack eveningly and the bowls are misaligned, too. They are attractive and cheap."
4,great book for first time breeders,"Lots of good, solid info for first time breeders, or those that need a refresher."
4,A good addition to his first book on water lilies,"There is a lot of information on the newer lilies,but I was disappointed there weren't more pictures of the lilies."
5,Amazing,Implements traditional gothenburg thrash melo-death metal in a superb fashion! Need I say more?
4,Revenge of the nerds,"It's easy to let your memories of Devo boil down to whip-cracking dweebs with red hydrant-shaped hats. Don't let it happen. Get this CD. You'll be surprised how many MTV memories will come jumping from the farthest corners of your head (if you're around 30 years old, that is). You'll recognize more songs than you think, and you'll never get the grin off your face. Incidentally, if you want man-machine music with more potency but without the chuckles, listen to the original robot band: Kraftwerk."
1,Not the right place for politics,"This book is another attempt to politicize issues related to kids. Any evidence suggested in here is based on the authors' views; that, or he has found a very few ""educators"" and ""experts"" who regurgitate his words. It is abundantly apparent that the book was NOT written with the best interests of children in mind...rather, it was intended to further the authors' political viewpoint."
3,For animation buffs,"Rather than going for ""banned"" or ""censored"" material (see my review for CARTOON CRAZYS: BANNED & CENSORED), this collection merely aims to be ""weird"" and at times successfully encompasses all three categories. Other than that, there's no real theme running through the 18 cartoons and short films gathered here. Cartoon favorites like Betty Boop, Daffy Duck, and Felix the Cat are represented, along with obscure works by Walt Disney and Max Fleischer. Outrageous racial stereotypes are provided by INKI AND THE MINAH BIRD, HOLD ANYTHING, LITTLE BLACK SAMBO, and SCRUB ME MAMA WITH A BOOGIE BEAT. Bizarre examples of stop-motion animation are on view in Charley Bowers' IT'S A BIRD and Wladyslaw Starewicz's FROGLAND and THE DEVIL'S BALL.On the downside, the print quality of some titles varies wildly, and not all the selections here can truly be categorized as ""weird."" Overall, this collection is best suited for animation buffs looking to augment their cartoon library."
2,"more like 'random, fading pre-50's cartoons...'","Just because it's weird, that doesn't make it original or entertaining. Some of these cartoons do have colour, but most seem stuck in the fairly plain wackiness of early American animation. Of course, anything Betty Boop is craaaaazy and trailblazing in that style, but too many are a series of bland rip-offs or racial stereotypes. There's one Robert Clampett cartoon and it's not even any good.What I liked best was the puppet animation (an obvious kind of gimmickry) the characters are at least more interesting.You'd be better off with 'Masters of Russian Animation', 'Animation Show' (which is fairly current), or the feature-film, 'Fantastic Planet' which is incredible! 'Cameraman's Revenge & Other Fantastic Tales' includes the best short on this disc and many different ones from the same inovator!"
1,Broken,The item came in completely broken due to poor packaging by the company. There is absolutely nothing to protect the handles (which were broken off) and the lid.
5,Too heavy,"I purchased this dutch oven to be used in my home - we no longer go camping. It was too heavy before I even mixed up a recipe so I did return it. If I were 20 years younger & a lot stronger, perhaps I would have kept it!"
3,OK for everyday use but no bargain,"When I needed to get replacement dishes I dicided to do some research over the internet. I was familiar with the Pfaltzgraff name and visited their website to find out more. I was impressed by the tradition of the company and came away with the impression that this was ""american made"" stoneware. This aspect was a very important in my decision to make the purchase. I was disappointed when the shipment arrived and found out that these pieces are chinese made. I thought I was getting a bargain for an american made product ... I'm not sure is such a bargain for a chinese made item.That said I would say this set is ok for everyday use and the color and design are atractive."
5,in awe,"I am in awe of the power of the title poem. I have read it over and over again for many years. So much power, truly awesome."
4,'Dark Rising' the movie,"I originally bought this movie because Cure Gravity (the Oshawa rock band) sings 'So Amazing' at the big finale. For sure it is a 'B' movie. But it is a good one. If your into scantily clad women running around slaying monsters and then having a big party to celebrate, then this is for you.Finally it actually has a pretty good story line but gets corny a lot."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"The best things this movie has going for it are the cast and the production values. Cast issues are obvious. Production values are surprisingly high, and take an otherwise bizarre, absurd concept into watchable territory. Frankly, the movie concept is not at all interesting, and will largely appeal to fans of D&D. Further, the gradual unfolding of the story leaves far too much to be wanted; it simply makes little sense and cannot rely on a David Lynch or Tarrantino level of artful telling to save it. There are a few scenes featuring battles with monstrous figures; the figure are, putting it mildly, laughably bad. Perhaps that was the intent (in an Army of Darkness kind of way, there are obvious parallels), but the whole thing just fails. So...the production values (i.e., image quality, camera work, etc.) are good enough to make this watchable, just don't expect a thriller."
5,amazing pattern,toasts are amazing looking/tasting with all the patterns..love to make b'fast now..so much better n safer than the long griddle i got for my ceramic top stovesuggestion to lodge: make a hinged or fitting top with a flat surface..that way you have both the panini n flat surface to take care of all b'fast items n many more
4,Boomer's Story,"Good stuff from one of Ry's most productive periods. (But if you already have ""Paradise and Lunch"" you don't need it)."
4,Extra thin polarizer,"After installing the filter I immeadiately noticed a remarkable difference in the sky background. I found the filter to be very clear and superior in quality. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the knurled portion for making adjustments is on the front of the filter as opposed to the side, as I have seen in other brands or thicker filters. It is somewhat difficult to turn the filter while setting up the shot and looking through the viewfinder at the same time, which causes fingers to come in contact with the glass portion of the lense, thus fingerprints. Other than that, I highly reccomend this product for its quality and lightness. ( have the weight of a convential filter )."
1,bad quality,"while adorable at first, the collar did not last. for $25 (after shipping) it should have lasted much longer than the 9 months i got out of it. the ""leather"" started peeling after about 6 months and the sparkles were gone after only about 4. i'm amazed at the poor quality."
2,What a disappointment!,"I thought these colors lookes so rich and beautiful, but when I received the dishes, they were much paler than the picture on the box. It really was not at all what I was expecting.Also, I will have to agree with the review by ""Dishman"". I read his before ordering, but just figured he was being too picky. But after receiving the dishes, I see what he's talking about. The pattern has a raised texture that seems to me (not that I am a dish expert by any means) that it would scrap or wear off after awhile. Dishes should be glazed so that there is a smooth surface to protect the pattern.I will be returning my dishes."
4,Not what I expected.,"The quality of the dishes were as expected but the design (pattern) on the dishes was not. The design was off a mass production line and not glazed, which is typical of other companies wanting to extend the life of their products."
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT LESS STARS,"I am proud to be Jewish, but this book has embarrassed me and my culture. What took 2,000 years to accomplish has been destroyed by one idiodic book. The subject matter is fascinating, but the legacy of the Jew has always been hard work. This was a quickly tossed off project with no real substance. I also find it humiliating that it was released in time for Christmas. Guy Oseary should stick to hanging out with Madonna and getting lucky by signing Alanis Morrissette."
3,Sparse,"This book has short profiles of Jews in rock n roll. One reviewer accurately set forth many serious omissions including two great Jays, Jay Segal of the Tokens and Jay Black of Jay and the Americans. I also noticed that the great producer for Atlantic Records, Jerry Wexler was not listed. This book includes very short profiles with little substance. Therefore, this book is not much more than a list.I found a profile of Carny Wilson interesting in which the author stated she is Jewish on her father's side. Really? Since when is Brian Wilson of the Beachboys Jewish?? Also, people who have some Jewish blood from their father's side but never lived as Jews are included so, the definition of a Jew is stretched. The book was a good idea but, it just doesn't cut it."
5,Instant Classic,"Ms Cruz has done some excellent work (e.g., Captain Corelli's Mandolin), but I think this is her best. A wonderful film!Correction: She did not return to her ""Italian roots"" to make this film; she's Spanish, and had to learn Italian for the film. Also, in this film, she's supposed to look ""awful""; it's part of the character."
5,"INTERESTING, GREAT ROMANCE STORY",THE BEGINNING STARTED VERY SLOW. BUT IT GOT INTERESTING FAST! IT GOT SAD TOWARD THE END. PENELOPE CRUZ LOOKED VERY DIFFERENT. TIMELO (I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW TO SPELL HIS NAME) LOVED ITALIA.
4,Great,The book is easy to read and keeps you curious to the point that you don't want to put it down. I met the author at a military post exchange. He was a real charmer and convinced me to buy the book even though I hadn't heard of it. I'm glad I did.Part of the appeal is not knowing how much is true and how much is fiction.
3,Disappointing recording,"Grumiaux is an both an excellent pianist and one of the finest violinists of the 20th century. He won 1st prize in both instruments while at conservatory. Consequently, he accompanies himself in the Brahms and Mozart VERY WELL. Very nuanced, terrific ""ensemble"" within himself. He didn't have to do this, Clara Haskil was still alive and well, but I suppose he just wanted to try the experiment. Unfortunately the Philips engineers let him down because the only problem is the sound quality. The piano sounds like an upright that has been pushed against the wall; it has no presence. It is almost as if they played back the prerecorded piano track over speakers while he overdubbed the violin part. The violin on the other hand, is quite forward and present. Surely Philips (one of the great recording companies) could have done better than this sonically drab effort.The Grieg sonata with pianist Hajdu is superb in every way."
3,Lost in translation,"It is no small challenge to translate Heidegger's's German, and though most of the time the translator's choices are felicitous, some other times her choice of words is disputable. However, what is really preoccupaying is that on a couple of occasions some of the translator's clarifying remarks, instead of being put in the footnotes and duly identified, are incorporated in the main text and come accross as Heidegger's own remarks. Whether it is the translator's or the publisher's fault, one thing is clear and that is that this is not a critical edition, and that the academic reader of the text should have the GA text at hand."
3,Damaged Booklet,"A good selection of numbers by Powell, who didn't make enough recordings, and a mostly all-star group. The CD is in good shape but the booklet was obviously water-damaged with some pages stuck together."
1,Did Not Receive Correct Product,"I was supposed to get a trumpet mouthpiece pouch. Received a carrying cloth to carry a french horn. I decided to deal with it later, and by the time I looked at how to return it, it was passed the returning window. So we just gave it away to a french horn musician. Annoying!!!"
5,kind to split ends,"30 years ago a Japanese mill with whom I was doing business, gave me this fabulous towel. It was nothing short of revolutionary. Of course I had to discard my beloved towel many years ago and was DELIGHTED to find this product again on AMAZON. I bought the large size to use for my hair - only because the smaller towel is just a tiny bit skimpy. It litereally drinks the water from hair. The time needed under the damaging effects of the hair dryer is now minimal and the styling of my ""DO"" is not effected. Really a marvel and so heatlhy for your hair. If you are considering this product, hestiate no more!"
2,Typical Sociology,"The book is not dense reading. Typical Sociology-oriented stuff about discrimination and whatnot. Not worth reading unless you need it for class. A decent textbook, though, if you need one."
2,Wow - what happend?,"I can't go along with the crowd on this one. I got a copy of the demo tape for the debut album and have enjoed it for years. Recently picked up the first album w/all tracks and it was good (unreleased demo version of ""drifting falling"" better though). Purchased Cerulan and was surprised by the lack of ""edge"". Songs seem deliberately soft without the new wave CHINKA-CHINKA that marked the first effort. You could play most on a easy listening station and not raise an eyebrow. I read the reviews that the 3rd and final album cuts a bit harder - I'll give it a try."
3,cane wrist strap,The cane wrist strap is a useful product and pretty well executed. I would like the strap to be a bit longer but then I would also like to be 20 years younger and not in need of a cane.
4,"Monkeys, bitten-off ears, and spies for an atheist group","Everything I want in a book: engaging characters, a bit of a plot, a little fun, a tiny bit of underlying seriousness.Sampath Chawla has grown up to become quite a disappointment to his family. He works in a post office where he spends most of his time reading the mail that comes through the office. His father is in despair; Sampath has no ambition.One day, Sampath leaves his job and, almost without thinking much about it, climbs up into a guava tree. He doesn't come down. As time passes, a mythology about Sampath begins to develop, and villagers come to sit under his tree, observe Sampath's tranquil state, and ask questions of Sampath. Sampath becomes known as a holy man.There's more, involving monkeys and romance, bitten-off ears and spies for an atheist group, but you get the idea. Fun, but not necessarily frivolous."
4,Sensuous treat,"If you love language and revel in its subtle crafting, this is the book for you. A short, dreamlike read that recounts a simple, sweet story of a middle-class family that finds it may have a young guru in its midst. How each family member reacts to this matter is the meat of the book. (A bit thin in story, yes, but I can't shake the feeling that there is a great political satire here that I am not quite smart enough to figure out.) Either way--enjoy this treat and watch for more from this wonderful author."
5,Where's the ending???,"The book goes along enjoyably enough for 99% of it, then stops abruptly. I think the author needs to go back and write a few more chapters! Extremely disappointing."
4,Helpful In Classes,"I was required to purchase this textbook for my BioAnthropology Class but just in general, it is a pretty good resource to learn about humans and primates. There are sections that are not very useful, but as long as you grasp the important concepts, it is a well-written textbook overall."
4,Mythic spirituality of the Hindu ethos,Good intentions often don't translate into cinema of true worth. Sanjay Jha's Strings takes its young protagonist Warren Hastings (Adam Bedi) through a voyage into the mythic spirituality of the Hindu ethos.The journey is at the most a hal
4,It's the best PSP hockey title,"This game is fun and fast paced. Unfortunately there is not a newer version, but I have a website that maintains a current roster for free at [...] Check it out, it definitely makes the game more playable."
5,All you need to know about growing bamboos in cool climates,"The author is one of those true bamboo experts, with lots of hands on growing experience under a cool British climate. The excellent photography, good descriptions, and many personal observations make this book so unique among the other, often repetitious books on bamboo. If you live in USDA Plant Hardiness zone 6 or cooler, this is your best book!"
2,"Too thin, wrong material","I bought this jacket thinking that the outside material would be a nylon. I was so disappointed when it arrived because it's very thin and the outside material is a velvety texture. Also, I agree with the other review that the jacket is too long and too large. The large did not follow the guidelines and is much too big for my dog (basset hound). If you are purchasing this jacket for cold weather, I highly suggest looking for a different one."
5,This Game Rocks!!!!!,"I saw this game at a store and decided to buy it. Well, I am glad I did! This game is awesome! The gameplay is nearly identical to NBA JAM TOURNAMENT EDITION for the SNES! It has all the NBA JAM moves and more! You can jump through the roof and jam in this game! It's very fun to play! I also like the fact that the CPU is very competitive. To me, it's very satisfying to win with a buzzer beater instead of being up by 40 points in the second quarter in games such as NBA IN THE ZONE. Simply put, this game is the best basketball game to own on a GAMEBOY."
1,Bait and Switch,"Like several other reviewers here, I too was taken in by Crawford's bait and switch tactic - I ordered a Hoya multi-coated, HMC circular polarizer, but was sent the inferior single-coated version. I'm amazed that,even after considerable negative feedback, Crawford continues this deceptive practice. It also appears that Amazon condones this fraudulent behavior since they do nothing to correct it. I suspect the folks at Amazon don't even bother to look at these customer reviews, Amazon's policy seems to be don't bother us with your complaints - you're on your own."
4,nice photos and reading but not much practical material,Good for a beginner to horses or a horse lover that wants some easy reading and pretty pictures but not much in the how-to department for actual horse training. The right ideas are there but not the specifics.
2,"Pretty, but little substance","It makes me angry that ""Pony"" has so slickly marketed his Native American heritage *and* jumped on the marketing bandwagon that Monty Roberts has engineered. To be sure, the photographs are quite nice ('though I'd prefer fewer of ""Pony"" and more of the horses), and while I'm all for the popularization of ""kinder and gentler,"" methods of horse training/relating to horses, I hate the unabashed and tacky slickness of ""Pony Boy's"" whole self-promotion industry.If you want *real* information and insight on horse-human interaction and true relationship training, do yourself (and your equines) a favor and pick up one (or better yet, all three!) of Mark Rashid's books."
2,Horse Follow Closely,"If you're looking for a book of Gawani Pony Boy photos this is the book for you. If you're looking for information on American Indian culture, you'll find that here too among the full page photos of Pony Boy riding his horse(s). If you're looking for a book on how to communicate with horses or what works for gently training a horse, you can spend half as much money on one of Mark Rashid's books and get 10 times as much human/horse relationship information. This book has a few good ideas on relating to a horse, too bad you have to pay for all those full color photos of Pony Boy to get that information."
2,It gets boring,To me it sounds like a weakened version of a good death metal band. Vocals are terrible (I get bored after the first two songs) and the music doesn't get better. If you're looking for awesome death metal album buy Origin's Echoes of Decimation or Nile's Among the catacombs of Nephren Ka.
4,first of all......,"... the mother facko's who are giving this album a bad review are probally the same people who bought the latest in flames cd. while their not as brutal as in goremageddon, they still have claims on ownage. i saw them live w/cryptopsy and suffocation here in seattle, and they rocked, i've been listening to these guys since goremagedden and personaly knew i might not get to see them again. so jumped at the opertunity to rock out with my c*ck out to thes belgium f_*ks, and was not dissapointed. as far as the album goes, i actually hated it for months after i bought it and untill recently when i saw their new video, i thought i might give the new cd a chance again, and found myself listening to it over and over at work. now i'm freaking hooked after seeing them live. shiznit i didnt even notice they had as many guest vocalist's on the cd untill i saw them live, a little bit let down that they resorted to another mans voice, but still it owns"
5,"Good gore, this is great!!!","This is precise gore/death metal. The vocals are insane, no talk about the guitars, they make good riffs and the drummer makes an interesting change of tempos and bombastic double bass. They're have a couple of solos too. Recommended if you like Carcass, Impaled and Cannibal Corpse."
3,Too Serious in places,"This is a pretty fun book but I found Lily's parents aggravating,I like christain stuff but this is too goody-goody.For example,when Lily decides to try modelling,her parents are afraid that walking down a catwalk isn't going to change the world.They make her ""find God in this"".Oh for Pitys sake,just let her model.They were idiots anyway.They told Lily they still loved her even though she was funny looking.""Lily,why would you ever think you were ugly?""...DUH!!!!!!!!!!"
1,OC product un complete!,"Well, I was skeptical of the price! The box was nice! Only one problem, Crucial season 3 disc 22 was not in the set, but disc 21 was in there twice! Great! Totally disappointed!"
4,oc complete collection,quick shipping. this is a christmas gift so have not viewed yet. looks like everything seller said.
1,Why would you buy this when you get can all 4 seasons seperately for less than $100?,This is dumb. You can buy all for seasons of this show right here on Amazon for only $95. Why on earth would you buy this?
1,An Abortion of Sound,"This music is seriously the worst thing I have ever heard. Richie Havens is just too talented to produce this kind of trash. Two thumbs down, way down."
4,Good little stickers.,"These have a nice texture and rich color. I'm sticking them to my black melamine desk (to cover screw holes), they don't stick very well, but that's likely because the surface is slick. On paper, these would be excellent."
2,Hoya HMC Skylight1b Ultra Thin - IS NOT Ultra Thin - Not even thin,This is unfortunately not a ultra thin filter with a thin filter ring. This is just a regular Skylight 1b filter. This is totally misleading. I am surprised Adorama is doing it. Got mine and no difference from my existing one :( and no mention of thin or ultra-thin in the box of the filter or the filter itself.
1,The crapilicious album of all time.,"For my version of this album, O.G. means old guy. For my opinion, he is not a very good rapper. He should retire pernamently."
1,Generic Survivor Lite,"This is NOT metal, its not even rock. Every song sounds like a Pepsi commercial or movie soundtrack during the travel montage. You will forget each song ten seconds into the next song. Its that generic. Heavy keyboards, guitars buried in the mix, and Appice's unspectacular drumming sounds like a drum machine. This is a very pale and very weak immitation of Survivor's ""Vital Signs"" album. If you like Survivor clones, then the search is over, here is a big one. Album comes in an ""environmental friendly"" (read cheap) cardboard cover. If CD are supposed to last forever, why do you need a degradable CD packaging? Guess they were anticipating alot of people throwing this CD away after one listen. So you get cheated out of a CD case along with getting cheated out of a real CD. I could have at least reused the CD case."
5,Very good melodic rock!,"If you enjoy 80's rock melodic bands like Survivor, Journey, Europe, Van Halen, Starship, full of keyboards and guitar solos, this cd is for you. I simply loved all songs. But note that this album is quite different than the other two! KK have changed their style in this album possibly to earn big bucks with the ""Iron Eagle"" movie soundtrack. But be aware that if you are an extreme headbanger, this cd will make you sleep. Anyway, Mark Free vocals are simply fantastic!"
3,Better than I expected It to be.,"I think this album was unfairly scathed by critics and fans alike. ""Kill uncle"" wasn't tantamount to Morrisseys debut opus ""Viva hate"" artistically but, in my subjective opinion, it was good enough to meet my satiety. Defintely one that will be lost in the shuffle. Worth checking out in my opinion just to hear the brilliant ""King Lear."""
1,Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review,"""Kill Uncle"":Weedy instrumentation backing weedy songs,many intentionally 'comic' but unintentionally 'horrible'.Notorious for depth of lyrical plumbing viz.""King Leer"".Low Point:""Found Found Found"",love song for Michael Stipe."
3,Some good songs but the rest is flat,"""Kill Uncle"" is a good album if you listen to selected songs instead of listening to the album as a whole. Songs like ""Sing Your Life"", ""King Leer"", and ""Driving Your Girlfriend"" are Morrissey classics but songs like ""Asian Rut"" and ""The Harsh Truth Of The Camera Eye"" break the flow of the album. Most people consider this Morrissey's worst album but it doesn't even come close to some of his other work. If you are a Morrissey fan then get this album. If you are new and looking for a Morrissey album to get then go get ""Bona Drag"" or ""Your Arsenal"". If you are cynical about Morrissey's work then you should skip this album. ""Kill Uncle"" is in the middle of the worst and best of Morrissey."
5,Great for small animals,"It weighs my baby tortoise perfectly fine in grams. I've been using it for over a month now and I like how when you use it the backlight is blue and easy to see. This scale is great for casual use. Not sure if it could handle constant daily use.I dislike the front protector, and how the AC adaptor doesn't come with it. It's worth the money and it better than the ones I've seen in several retail stores."
1,Scale is great; shipper is terrible!,"The scale itself is great, but someone at PC-GURU is a liar. First, in their rebuttal of my first rating, PC-GURU claims I never asked for a refund of the return postage I paid to return the broken scale I first received. This is absolutely NOT TRUE! I did request they pay the return postage in my e-mail about receiving the broken scale, and they did not even acknowledge the request except to refer me to Amazon policies stating I would be responsible for returns. Amazon itself refunded my postage. Second, PC-GURU claims they sent me a replacement quickly; this is also untrue. I sent the broken scale with signature confirmation per Amazon instructions; the replacement took TWO WEEKS to arrive at my home. I STAND BY EVERYTHING I SAID IN MY ORIGINAL REVIEW AND RATING OF THIS SELLER. NOW I ADD--WATCH OUT!!!! PC-GURU LIES! Order the scale from someone else--it's a great scale, but PC-GURU is NOT trustworthy!"
1,They turned off within less than a minutes.,"I purchased this because of good reviews. But they turned off during measuring within a less than a minutes, I gave one more try and happened again, today I am going to return it. Very disappointed."
3,"MacBook Pro 17"" Protector","The item it self is very good, how ever it didn't fit my macbook pro 17"".RegardsSawsan"
1,Oh Dear!!!!,"I called Amazon and asked if this item would fit a PowerBook G4. I did not understand what the women said so I called back and tried again, to no avail. Finally I called and spoke with someone who told me, Yes, it would fit the PowerBook G4 OK. Well of course it did not and the whole process was a waste of time. I gave it away to some one who had a Mac it did fit. So my comment is, I could have spent more time with my cat's pet duck!!"
5,"Case gives good protection, is tricky to install.","The case was delivered promptly and in perfect condition, Had too much packaging which gave me pause, but products made for Apple usually have too much and China isn't close. The bottom half was easy to attach but I found the instructions for attaching it unclear. Some credit cards held very close to the card's edge for support and inserted between the case and computer will force-bend the case to make room for the computer. The computer surface tolerated this without being marked by the card.I've been very satisfied with it and it allows the user to put an arm on the case when not in use, without fear of denting the aluminum. One day I carried it in a heavy wind and a few specks of black blew between computer and case. Not wanting to remove the case repeatedly, I now usually carry it inside something wind proof. They do warn you about leaving specks there where they can scratch."
4,"Action Picks up as Series Moves Toward Conclusion, but Consistency Thrown by the Wayside","Into the Labyrinth is book 6 of 7 in The Death Gate Cycle. Each of the four worlds have been explored (one each over the first 4 books), and set-up is complete for resolution over the final 2 books. Into the Labyrinth has the most world-hopping thus far in the series, but unsurprisingly given the title it is our first major exposure to the nightmarish Labyrinth the earlier books hinted at.Into the Labyrinth is probably the most action-heavy book in the series. If that's all you're looking for, you will be more than pleased. There are some great sequences. But unfortunately Weis and Hickman throw much of what we have already learned about to the wind in bringing things to a head. There are just way too many contradictions of what we learned earlier in the series."
2,Typos Galore,"I love these authors and was glad to have found some of their books on the Kindle, but this book was so full of typos I was tempted to stop reading it several times. I think it would have been better to read the paper copy then this flawed electronic copy."
5,A classic collection of some of Silvio's best songs,"This cd features some of Silvio Rodriguez's best songs. There is nothing quite as beautiful as ""Unicornio"" and ""Playa Giron"". These are my two favorite songs on the cd, but this cd is simply great and serves to prove that Silvio Rodriguez is one of Cuba's finest contemporary singer/songwriters."
5,"Richard P. Havens, 1983","I have listened to this for many many years and this is the best sounding disc yet!!! im very happy with this for many reasons, but the sound is like brand new!!!ENJOY! i met Richie years ago and i had him sign my other copy of this cd. he asked me if i wanted to get rid of it, he never got a copy from the old label. what a shock! he is wonderful and so down to earth. keep on doing what you do Richie!"
5,The memories linger on,"I first purchased this on cassette about fifteen years ago it knocked me out then, when I listen it today I still feel moved by the mature and sensual lyrics. I personally feel that it's not a bad song on the entire disc."
4,Great for any director,This puts the duties of a director into perspective. It emcompasses a lot of the tasks that amateaur directors neglect. It was an easy read and hit a lot of bases that film books miss.
1,Unhappy customer,Tried this product on two different occasions using different doses. Both times experienced vomiting and headaches. For the first day felt a small increase in tear production but the side effects were too severe to merit taking the capsules.
2,lost in mail,"i orderd this ring for mine and my wife wedding aniversary well in advance, and it got lost in the mail. then once i got it, after our aniversary, i was not impressed at all in fact it really sucks."
1,Not What I Was Expecting,I needed a travel size replacement for my Conair hot air brush. This thing doesn't have any power. It's useless so it's going in the trash.
1,Not what I wanted,I was trying to find a small curling brush that was 3 /4 inch and metal so that it would hold the heat. This one is plastic. it does not hold the heat nor does it work well. It does not curl on the larger 1 inch. I wish there was a way I could return this item.
4,good way to style hair,"This brush is a good way to style hair. It is easy and fast. Would like it to be a wee bit hotter, but then maybe it would burn my hair. I am happy with the way my hair turns out. The soft brush makes my hair smoother than the hard brush types."
1,Disappointed,"Have had numerous Conair products that I loved, but consider this one worthless. It is too low power and too cool of a temperature. I'd love go back to my 10 year old hot air brush, but that would require me to grow out my hair because of the bigger size. Do not buy this unit!!!!!"
2,conair blowdying brush,"i bought this item because i used the older model that a friend of mine had. i liked how it made my hair fuller and shinier. when i bought this newer model, i never used the smaller attachment because my hair is pretty thick and it would take forever to style with. the larger attachment didn't make my hair as full and shiny as the older model i used. maybe i wasn't using it correctly, but i just put it away and never use it anymore. i might pull it out again one day and try to use it again, but not any time soon. also, i wanted to curl my hair with it, but that does't work so well on asian hair, so don't buy it for the curling option if that's the case."
4,Excellent,It was my very first game I ever played in my life when I was a little kid and I want to play it again
2,Strong Bark But No Bite,"I bought this grinder knowing that Black and Decker tools have had great reputation in my family. Also this grinder looks and feels like its built tough. For the first months of use it was very impressive. Strong motor, comfortable grip, and less vibration too. I was impressed.That is until the spindle lock button started sticking and then the rubber molding on the sides began to come undone. Finally after three months the button finally broke off.I work in a Industrial trailer and truck repair shop...not exactly the heaviest grinding atmosphere.Hope this helps you hard core welder/fabricators out there."
4,Broad view of archaeology of military orders,An academic study which provides reference to earlier workers and brings up to date the latest findings. Full of fascinating detail and easy to work through. Logically presented the book discusses and amends where necessary the ideas of other students of crusader archeology. Very readable.
3,Nice for the intermediate painter,"This book covers equipment, processes, and project planning very well. There is minimal ""how to"" for the novice, however. I'd definitely recommewnd a beginning painter start elsewhere, and move into this book."
3,Hard to understand!,"I bought this book for my class, but honestly I felt hard to understand the concepts presented in this book."
5,Excellent CD & Worth Every Dollar,"There is no doubt that Frank Sinatra was one of the best singers and entertainers of all time. This 20 song CD of his greatest hits proves this statement as it includes fan favorites such as ""Luck be a Lady"", ""Love and Marriage"", as well as the ever popular ""New York, New York"".Before I bought this CD, I was debating whether to get the two disc CD that's available at amazon which contains all of the songs on this CD and more. But I ended up buying this one, and even though it's great, I kind of regret not buying the two disc.If you only want some of Franky's hits, this CD is just for you. But if you're looking to have a complete collection, buy the two disc edition entitled ""The Very Best of Frank Sinatra"". You won't regret. Especially if the two disc is just as good as ""The Very Good Years""."
5,Superb,"If you like Sinatra, you will love this album. If you love Sinatra, it will be one of you favorites. It collects many of his biggest hits and these are prime recordings.Sinatra's vocals speak for themselves. His talent is evident here. His orchestration here is first rate as are the musicians. The recording quality is superb. There is nothing not to like.It's a deal!"
1,I Can't Stand Frank Sinatra!,"I'm not a fan of Frank Sinatra! I purchased this CD because there are three songs on this CD which were performed by Gordon MacRAE during several concerts during the 1970s that I cannot get a hold of on a record or a CD! The three songs are ""My Kind Of Town&#34, ""Send In The Clowns"", and ""My Way"". Sinatra invited Gordon MacRAE onto his show back in 1952 and he told Mr. MacRAE that he was fat! That was the real reason why Sinatra's career was in the toilet in the early 1950s. He was a jealous, nasty, vicious, and stupid person for having done that to Mr. MacRAE If anyone reading this now can get any or all three songs performed by Gordon MacRAE on a CD or record I would appreciate it!"
4,He did it his way.,"Choosing the best 20 tracks from ""Frank Sinatra"", is like choosing the best 20 from ""Elvis"", hard to do. But as an intro for casual fans, this is great. Pretty much the best of the best is here. Nice that it runs in chronological order, from early songs like ""Night and Day"" and ""Way You Look Tonight"", to ""That's Life"" and ""Theme from New York, New York"". Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything obvious missing. My only complaint, is that every time I hear ""Love and Marriage"", I think of the show ""Married With Children"", which annoys me. If that's a concern for you, check out ""Classic Sinatra"". It's a similar 20 track collection. So get some ""Frank"", then move on to some ""Dean"" and ""Tony""."
3,Some Tweaking Required,"When I first purchased this book, I installed the software, only to find that it would not compile after Chapter 3. This was frustrating and very discouraging. After reading the Microsoft technical documentation for Direct7, I learned that you may need to go to Tools->Options->Directories and make sure C:\mssdk\include and C:\mssdk\bin appear at the top of the directory lists there.Once I got it working, I was impressed with the graphics. If you are focused on writing 3D games for Win32, this book is a good investment. Otherwise, don't bother - read the SDK and use the examples there."
2,Awesome power . . . is a better buy,"Fortunately, I didn't break the CD label so that I could take this book back. The book had little more to offer than is found in the Direct 3D help files. In fact, I have not seen a good Direct 3D book yet. In my opinion, the best book on Direct X is the ""OpenGL Programming Guide."" Really, I'm not being sarcastic. I use it to learn how to make the calls, then look up the calls using the Microsoft Direct 3D help files. This approach works especially when using the D3DX interface.Kovach's previous book ""The Awesome Power. . ."" was definitely a better effort, especially since he has now updated the book for Direct X 7.0"
4,WOW!,"I can't believe I almost forgot about this album! Duh. It's been years since I had heard this, and then actually heard ""The Wagon"" on the radio(?) and went, ""Whoa!"". So many bands have borrowed from J.Mascis' style on this album- it was really very different in the time when everything ""grunge"" was cool. AND- every song on this album is good, something you never get nowadays. I'm actually purchasing this CD (and that says alot) to replace my old cassette. haha"
4,Wow.... best cookies EVER! Delicious!!!,I can't keep these in my house because I can't stop eating them... better than any other store bought cookie I've ever had in my life... YUM. These will now be given as gifts for ANY and ALL occasions.... simply to die for!!!
4,The Corn is Still Green,"Despite the ugliness of the packaging - all that cheap plastic is definitely Un-Kate - there is one gem in the collection that deserves its own separate release: The Corn is Green. It's a made-for-tv movie directed by George Cukor, shot on location in glorious Wales. Hepburn is divine, but supported for a change by a galaxy of marvelous players. Rent the Bette Davis version so you can see how good this is by comparison. Warner's early version of Emlyn Williams' play is dreadful, and Davis was much too young for the role. There was no location shooting in those days, and black-and-white wouldn't have helped it either. All that's left is the value of a good teacher at the right time, and they blew that. Remakes are sometimes a gift to us (think Lord of the Rings) and this is a lovely gift indeed."
5,police car,my disabled son certainly had fun putting it together. he loves police cars and never seen one that wasn't tyoe two.
1,HUH??,"This lamp has absolutely NO art deco characteristics whatsoever!Just look at it! It's horrid!To me, it seems to have that ugly 70's ""Mediterranean/Spanish"" flair to it. The only thing missing is red crushed velvet somewhere on it."
1,Disappointing...,"I hate to be negative, but this book is bad - it's poorly written, and I can only assume poorly researched - the author said he heard the band 'Fish' (complete with quotes) play in Burlington, VT. The band is Phish, and whoever fact checked the book should have picked this up.I actually expected typos, considering the caliber of the grammar. Luckily I didn't find any, but I didn't spend too much time looking. And Love Canal? I can't imagine it's a great place to visit/live no matter what the EPA says."
2,Uncomfortable,"These were kind of stiff and uncomfortable from the start, and after 2 years nothing has changed. I don't think I'll buy this brand anymore. I hadn't actually tried them on prior to buying, but normally leather shoes adjust to your feet."
3,The Mcgraw & Hill guide to Starting your own business,"I feel this book has alot of good information, but for me some things were hard to understand. It has given me new views and I do think this is a great book if you already know alot about business. For me I am clueless so I think I need a more direct guide."
4,"Blood Types, Body Types and You",Great read. I love how the author uses language that the lay person can understand and gives prime examples for the average person to follow. Will be starting the plan to eat for my blood type very soon. Thanks.
5,NOT A DIET ...A new way to live!,"This book was recommended to me and since adopting it's suggestions, I have lost a total of 130 pounds and kept it off. All of my allergies have completely gone away. I am no longer athsmatic. I have a fantastic amount of energy! I no longer have heartburn, constipation or sleep disturbances; things which plagued me all of my life. I would encourage purchasing the book in hardback, as a large section in the back is recipes... I would encourage you to try it- and if it looks dificult, take it a few steps at a time: do what you can do, then adopt stricter practices when you are ready. Everything in the book has been tested scientifically, although not with a human test group. It's not a diet, it's a new way to live! Once you go off of it, all of your problems will come back. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD EVER FEEL SO FANTASTIC!!!"
5,Blood Types,This is an excellent book that gives the reader knowledge of what foods work with their blood types. Highly recommend this book to everyone!
3,hard to do,"First of all, I do not believe in infomercials. Second, I do not see any hard evidence to support this theory.This author calls himself a doctor. I do not see MD behind his name. Some of what he says is true, but most of it is only theory. It is impossible to get many of the products he mentioned in the book. Ezekiel bread, millet bread, rice bread,spelt pasta,Braggs Amino, i can not find in my GNC store. I live in a small town and we do not have any other health stores. I don't even know what some of this stuff is!. Now I like the meal replacements and snack products. Naturally he sells these on his web site. In spite of all of this I am going to try the 21 day starter program. I have to be suspicious of anyone that writes a diet book and sells the products. I wish he would sell the products I can not find."
2,misplaced heat,"Bought this 3 1/2 qt. version a year ago to replace the venerable old version. It looks fine and has held up well. However, the handle can get too hot to handle at times. Most aggravating, and causing me to throw it out, when you pour, it almost always spits hot water on your hand. There is no way to hold the handle differently so you don't get sprayed with scalding hot spurts."
1,product manufacture,The product was defective and did not produce the whistle because the top was not spring loaded properly and did not seal the boiling water steam. The supplier did not realize this as he had not opened the box to inspect the item. He accepted full responsibility and returned my purchase price. I am satisfied that the supplier is reliable and honest.
5,Great Graphics,"The game has unbelievable graphics, you feel like you are there. I love this game and don't ever get tired of it. There are many different settings you can play on the game. The game can be challenging depending how good you are and how hard you want it to be. So much fun!"
3,5 stars if you've never gone up Against the Giants before...,"I agree with the previous review; for an old timer like me (started playing D&D back in the 70s) the Giants modules are absolute classics. However, I felt the new campaign section was weak, adding nothing to the original modules. That said, the original Giants adventures are phenomenal for someone unfamiliar with them. I suggest finding a copy of the old supermodule Queen of the Spiders that collects the Giants, Descent Into The Depths Of The Earth, Vault Of The Drow, and Queen Of The Demonweb Pits. It far better fulfills the promise of the Giants adventures, integrating them into a very fulfilling campaign."
4,Simplified Russian Grammar by Mischa H. Fayer,"I have been teaching Russian Grammar for 21 years. This books is great for the students to understand grammar better. I always use it together with the main teaching Textbook. It is well written, easy to understand and work with.This book should be used for GRAMMAR, some words are outdated. But this textbook is very helpful as additional one."
4,part two?,"I'm holding out hope for a part two. There's some myspace rumblings about a College Prophets 2. Focusing more on the Well. This is the kind of stuff Troma used to be famous for. Watch the film or ""That's not Sexy""!!!!"
3,Bad Boys,"Boys behaving badly is my favorite, this film becomes a tad too cartoony towards the end and some of the thoughts don't seem to connect but the narration is cool and the military guy is a good looking chap."
4,gorgeous painting,"A complicated paint by number. Rated a 4 because I think the paints could be better quality. One of my first but turned out beautifully. Learned some technique, did some free style on the eagle wing (the print was not true to the pic) but it turned out well. The mist/fog was the hardest part. Made my day when neighbors stopped by and ooohed and ahhhhed about my ""talent"", not knowing it was a pbn. :) I'm going to seal it with an acrylic varnish; something I learned by researching an art supply site. Should include this suggestion with the key. Overall a great buy for a quality product!"
1,Sheesh ! What was I on when this was watched !!!,"Sheesh ! What was I on when this was watched !!! Good lines are worthrepeating,This is one crazy flick.The fact it is PART 3 ,Is amazing in the least. The script ,WEGUESS,Brings back multiple characters from PARTS 1 & 2.Poor,Poor WALTER ?,This guy seems the the glue to storyline. If youmight like SNL skits( The really off-put awkward ones),Maybe MontyPython-ish nonsense,Some of Mel Brooks-scribed ill thoughts onfilm,Think we can stop there.Cannot tell you would ever search out parts One & Two now,AfterThree...Think We are up speed on these crazy beings that inhabit thisflick."
1,Poor mitre gauge.,"This attachment is a waste of money for one simple reason: The mitre gauge flexes left to right when set so there is no way to get a perfectly square cut. It doesn't matter how tightly locked in everything is, the fence on the mitre will move. I called Dewalt directly to see if there was a fix for this. They told me they were aware of the issue but that it was not a significant variance to warrant a manufacturing correction."
4,Good product,"My experience so far isn't different than many others. I like the table a lot. Like many, I'm sure, I lifted the nasty up there by myself and thought I was going to lose 11 of my 10 fingers for the momentary insanity. As luck would have it, I remain whole--in body anyway, but it is a pretty heavy table. Anyway, it was packed well and undamaged when I got it. My only complaint so far is the same as you've read here. The miter gauge has play even after I went through the prerequisite rituals of tightening anything that looked like it might tighten. I tried rigging something, and I tried facing the table toward Mecca while prostrating myself. Finally, the only thing that worked was getting online and buying a worthy replacement for the miter gauge. I'm taking the dewalt miter gauge in the house and see if I can't work my way through the system to see where it's breaking down."
5,Excellent Add On,"I had absolutly no trouble with reading, understanding and following the instruction when installing the DW7461 Heavy Duty Table Slide to my Dewalt Table Saw.To me the key was. Don't go to the following step until the prior one is completly understood and inplemented.Well worth the cost."
2,Minimally helpful,"All information in these lectures can be found in other sources (Brunson's Super System, Caro's Book of Tells, etc.) in much, much greater detail. Of the hours and hours of information on this DVD, I found maybe 5% of it useful. For the price they're charging... that's not very good pot odds."
4,I bought this saw...,"a while back and, I have to share space in my garage with those darn cars so...I got the base for it so I can easily move it around. It was my first table saw purchase and I did some pretty extensive research on the various models and price ranges and decided on the DeWalt.It came in a box that looked like it had been sent through Haiti before the earthquake and survived but, all the parts were there and set up was relatively easy.To me, and my price range, I feel it is an excellent saw."

3,School Bus is Fun!,"I searched in most toy stores in the UAE for a Yellow School bus like the one my children ride to school daily and I couldn't find one. I thought why not checking it on Amazon. and to my surprise, I found several options available one of which is the metro bus. I bought 1 large Schylling Large Bus along with 2 Metro Buses. (One of the Metro buses reached with a broken stop sign; The Schyllin bus reached in a perfect condition).The kids liked them so much but got bored with them after 2 days. One the second day, my son threw the large one on the floor for some reason that he doesn't know.....the good thing is that the bus is still working, but with back tires un-alligned :)"
4,It's Okay,"My son loves school buses so he really enjoys this die cast replica. It is not very durable though. Within the first day, the stop sign was broken off as well as the front doors. The doors could be reattached however, the stop sign was a goner. I would have rated this much lower if not for the look on my son's face when he received it."
3,Bus without Stop Sign,"The bus arrived without the stop sign. In fact, it was packaged without the sign at all. It had clearly broken off but had been shipped to me anyway. Now, being it's going to a 4-yr-old boy, I never anticipated the stop sign to last long but it would have been nice to present it to my son with the sign still in tact. Not worth returning it for a replacement. Hopefully the rest of the bus will last a little bit longer."
1,No good for beginner -- It turned me to other books.,"I just read couple of pages and it dosen't attract me at all. It watsed me much more than 24 hours learned nothing about how to master MFC! As the title indicates, it should give you a easy way to learn some basic skill about MFC, but it just explain some code the App Wizard generated. You cann't learn how to add your code in it."
4,Quite complete guide for a Welsh Terrier owner,"I found the book quite complete, except it teaches nothing about an important subject as stripping the Welsh Terrier, which was one of my basic reasons to buy it! Besides that, it has a lot of general info about the breed, how to take care of your dog, etc. It also has half a dozen very nice pictures of good examples of this breed."
5,Love it!!!,"I love Lion King and I love the game! I used to play it all the time as a kid until I lost it, and I'm so happy I bought it again! :D"
3,Shoulda done this a long time ago!!!!!!!!!,This CD has just about every great song he ever made. Other than that........NO LIMIT will still get VERY LIMITED revenue off this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,this product is made by cuisinart,A necessary replacement part. Will extend the life of your blender. Why is this more than what's offered direct from the manufacturer?
5,Good Value,"Sure, you could make your own out feed table, but the 7463 is designed specifically for the saw and attaches from the box in about 5 minutes with a couple of wing nuts on the rear fence support. The 2 rear legs are sufficiently sturdy and height adjustments are easy to make to compensate for what most of us have to deal with in uneven garage floors. The miter slot was routed in perfect alignment with the saw table slot and the top material matches the 52"" fence side extension table. Dewalt should consider offering this in a wider model but for most of your outfeed needs it works fine."
1,Not big enough....,"Your outfeed table should be at least as large as the main table of the saw. This one seems quite small to me. Also it takes up floor space and only serves one purpose. I built an outfeed table a little wider than the table of the saw, with storage below, and a router table insert built in to the top. Makes more sense in a small shop where you have to optimize the use of all your space. I used 3/4 in plywood for a subbase and covered it with 1/4 hardboard. When the hardboard gets messed up (glue, dings and dents) its easy to unscrew that piece and replace it with a new one. Cheap too, I figure I have about $50 in the table and an hour of my time. Can't recommend this extension table."
4,Good book if you are new to Hold'em,"This is a clearly written and well organized beginner's guide to low-limit Hold'em. If you want to understand the basic concepts, this is as good a book as any to use. However, you may need to supplement your study of this book with several hundred hours of actual play before the concepts really sink in. Be sure to read more advanced books while you are at it, such as Doyle Brunson's ""Super/System"", Sklansky's ""Theory of Poker"", and get a good reference on Hold'em statistics, such as Tablanette's ""Statistics of Hold'em Poker"". You might also want one of the videos on tells. And above all, if you are going to play in a card club or casino, observe the winners - those who actually end up with the most chips - and see if you detect patterns in how they play. Nothing can replace your own observation and analysis."
5,Great useful book,"Of all the poker books I have I think this one might be the best for the intermedaite player. Easy to understand, well planned chapters, and vital info throughout. Add a Sklansky book on Hold Em and your will be tough to beat."
3,accuracy???? not so much!,"Fortunately I am not trying to get an ""exact"" measurment. For my purpose this works ok because I just want to get to the closest ""foot"". Sometimes I have to ""measure"" 3-4 times to feel confident that it is close."
1,ATV Offroad,"HELLO!!!! We didn't get the game OR the movie that was supposed to be included with this PSP. I must say, we are extraordinarily disappointed."
1,Very small car,"I suppose I should have read the measurements for this car before I purchased it, but when I received it I was astonished at how small it was. It is only slightly larger than a Matchbox car. So while I am sure it is a fine toy, it is not very large."
2,Belly Dancing Enlightment,"I received the DVD, and was NOT impressed with this Enlightenment program. I also ordered her ""Fitness"" DVD, and it is spectactular, GREAT!!! I would not order the Enlightenment DVD...go for the Fitness one!!!jmd"
4,"beautiful, BUT you definitely have to IRON it every time.","I really love the colors and the style of this tablecloth. I need this odd size and it is hard to find this size at a reasonable price. However, you Definitely Need To IRON it. I would probably purchase this again. But really need to find a blend that is wrinkle-free next time."
4,One of the best for the money,This is a great blade for cutting heavier guage mild steel. Runs smooth and can be resharpened several times to extend the life of the blade. Works well on my milwaukee saw.
1,"DON""T BUY THE MP3s!","Even thought it doesn't say so, the mp3s are the ones with the piano soloist, not the ones where you can play along with the recording. The recording itself is fine, but I already had a few versions and only bought it for the music minus one aspect of it, so I just wasted my money."
2,"""Crazy"" is amazing. Too bad the rest isn't","I recently caught the video for ""Crazy"" by Seal on VH1. After years of having heard this song on the radio and not knowing who it's by, I finally know. That song is amazing. As for the rest of the album, I can't say it has much of an identity to speak. of. Seal definitely has similar vibe to Sting (check out the vocal similarity on ""The Beginning""), but ""Crazy"" is the ONLY good song on his debut. The rest of the songs are dull and have no hook. Buy the single instead. If you loved ""Crazy"" like I did, check out ""House of Stone & Light"" by Martin Page and ""Just Another Day"" by Jon Secada. They are both excellent songs that have an identical style to Seal's ""Crazy."" Who knows, you might even like these better than ""Crazy."""
5,Wow,"I decided to pop this thing back in my car tape player the other day. I was blown away all over again. If anything, eleven years later this music is even BETTER than it was the first time around. Now that's saying something. Seal has crafted timeless, simply excellent, singer-songwriter influenced R&B Britpop. But I'm being somewhat ridiculous; this music defies label and perhaps even description. What matters is that it clearly fits into the ""good music"" category, not the ""bad music"" rubbish heap. Kudos to Seal for making such an important artistic statement. Danceable, lovely, thoughtful, thought-provoking."
3,pretty good,"as a writer,vocalist&musician this man is a great talent.this disc is a pretty good debut.Crazy was a catchy song."
3,Should have been first in the series.,"Enjoyable as much for the historical backdrop as anything. There were, however, many times when I wondered where the story was headed, although the characters are well developed. I would have preferred to give an extra 1/2 star, but that option was not available."
3,"It's the end, Adric, but the moment has been prepared for.""","When I first viewed Logopolis years ago, it was as someone who was watching Doctor Who for the first time. The whole idea of regeneration was great. I was awed by the performance of Tom Baker and moved by his death scene. Years later, in retrospect, after watching other regeneration stories, I find that Tom Baker's departure was rather lackluster. The story was pretty simple to begin with and his actual death, losing his grip on a tower and falling to his death, just seemed not as large as life for the character Baker portrayed. Kind of a letdown."
4,Initiatives for Quality Improvement,"A customer is the King ! If there is Quality product, the customer satisfaction ratio level rises up. Customer chooses its high-end needs and service follows. This is the point when this Book comes in too informative to fill in service based approach. With the case studies, the book provides the Executives to go for a solution to satisfy a customer not only with quality but with the service to boost up the sales thereby with cost cutting factors and provide transactions quick and easier with added services and yet not adding the staff. The delivery process can be made much effective with the cost cuts with the clear examples and like other Six Sigma in Business, this one is sure pick for all Manufacturing unit Executives who also believe in Quality Service. Good Read."
5,A DRILL OF DISTINCT QUALITY,"THIS DRILL IS AN EXCELLENT DRILL WITH EVERYTHING YOU WILL EVER NEED WITH ITS ELECT. BRAKE, 1 HOUR CHARGER, 360 IN/LBS OF TORQUE AND EXCELLENT BALANCE AND FEEL. AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON DIFFERENT MAKES AND MODELS OF CORDLESS DRILLS THIS WAS THE BEST DRILL ON THE MARKET IN MY OPINION. TRY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
3,Excruiating Detail,"This author goes into excruiating step by step detail, in a connect the dot kind of way, without adding enough perspective to get an overall picture. But digging deep enough and re-reading will teach you how to build a forge burner."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this book. You might as well buy a textbook for the same price that you would be buying this book. Save your money and use 501 verbs instead. The main problem with 501 verbs (according to reviews) is that it is bad to study/learn with. Duh. It's meant to be a reference when you don't know how to conjugate a verb. And most of the verbs that are not in it are regular anyways, so why would you need the book...?"
1,The Super NintendoVersion Is Better...,That's right i said it. The Super Nintendo version is better. the gameboy version sucks.
1,Worst cd that I have ever bought,"I just bought this CD and was thoroughly disappointed. I have been listening to my two old Crash Test Dummies CDs for years...and they have never gotten old. So, I thought I would buy another CD to see how they have changed over the years. I own over 1,000 cds and this is the worst one in my collection."
2,"Out of date, try Pale Ale, Revised from the same series...","This is a good book, but a LOT has changed in the brewing world since it's publication. Especially in the realm of the homebrewer. For a more complete and up to date reference on this style I'd recommend Terry Fosters revised book of the same title. It is book 16 in the Classic Beer Style Series. Happy Brewing."
2,Grade school level,"I love World War I and this book had received a lot of attention this summer, so I decided to read it. Fifty pages into it, I gave up. This book represents so-called popular history to the extreme. It is simplistic, and quite frankly boring. It reads much like a grade school or high school history textbook. The only thing I found really worthwhile in this book were the appendices, which actually documented the diplomatic correspondences leading up to the war. If you want a good book about the coming of World War I, read Dreadnought by Robert Massie. It is far more thorough, and nowhere near as mindlessly simplistic as this book. Don't waste your time, Europe's Last Summer is a huge disappointment."
4,Excellent narration,"As in all other books I have read by Prof. Fromkin, I find his narration style quite exquisite. This is a very readable popular history book, excellent for beginners on the topic. As pointed out by another reviewer, I ran into some excessive repetitions too but did not find them that irritating. I felt that some more information on seemingly secondary events (such as the Balkan wars, state of the Ottomans, etc) could have been included.The book is not the result of a special research or new findings by the author; it is a narration of events that gave way to WWI as told, reported and recorded by historians and researchers. There is no asserted thesis or a claim and that is how a book of this type should be. It is a beautiful narrative with some questions and opinions by the author inserted here and there."
1,Shame on the Crayola Company,"I just bought the Crayola Floating Art Desk for my four-year-old son. I filled the tub, he got in. I set the ""Floating Art Desk"" down and he immediately took it and sank it. It then suctioned to the bottom of the tub. My four-year-old son pulled it up - but the suction cups pulled out of it and became stuck to the bottom of the tub. I pulled them off, but cannot stick them back into this ""Floating Art Desk"".The crayons mushed the first time we tried to use them.His interest lasted about five minutes with this thing since everything keeps disintegrating and breaking every time he touches it.How sad that the Crayola Company isn't what it used to be."
4,The Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking,"I've met someone who recommended this book. After reading 260 pages, I quit one week before Thanksgiving 2011. For me it was soooooooooooo easy. Don't know why but it was for me ! If I only knew why, I would have quit many years sooner."
2,Not the book I thought it would be,"I was not impressed at all with Allen Carr's Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking! I read the book all the way through, and when I finished, the only thing I could think was that Mr. Carr is making a lot of money, but not producing a good product. It did not help at all with me. Just saying I am a non-smoker doesn't get it with me! That is basically the premise of the whole book. Don't waste your time reading this book if you really want to quit. I went to a doctor and got a prescription for a pill that really seems to be working. I have smoked for 30 years a pack a day. I quit, but not because of Mr. Carr!"
3,great book but did not help me quit,This was a very good book but again did not help me quit smoking. Wish this helped but hopefully it will help others.
5,It really is easy!!,"I smoked for 30 years. I long ago accepted the fact that I'll never be able to quit. After reading this book, I'M A NON-SMOKER!! I never would have believed it. I wish I would have found this book years ago. I strongly recommend this book. The worst that can happen is you're no worse off than when you bought it. All this book does is destroy all the myths and in the process show us how EASY it is to quit once we know the truth. You owe it to yourself or someone you love to buy this book. It's the best investment of my life!!"
3,did me some good,"There were some helpful points made in the book, different ways of looking at smoking, which I really found encouraging. The book is poorly written, however, so the reader has to muddle through that. He repeats himself hundreds of times and he belittles some major issues, like nicotine addiction, as no big deal,with show-me-where-it-hurts flippant comments. Nevertheless, the book became my friend and inspired me to escape smoking, as he calls it. I also agree with him that replacement therapy does nothing to address the true problem of nicotine addiction, but I needed a security blanket and got an e-cigarette. It's only been 2 weeks, but I feel great and often forget to use it. The book was a big part of my escape, can't deny it."
5,Back in the Day: The Best of Bootsy,LIKE THE TITLE SAYS (Back in the Day The Best of Bootsy)THESE WHERE THE BEST TIMES WHEN MUSIC WAS MADE NOT COPIED.BRINGS BACK THE MEMORIES OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS...............
1,Very Poor Warrantee Service,"I had previously rated this item a 3-star since the clutch quit working after about 250 2.5"" screws. Sent it off to the nearest service center who had to send it to the factory. Approx 7 weeks later I get a drill back but not the one I sent. It is very scarred up and the battery they returned is not functioning. The work and aggrivation so far is more that a cordless drill will save me in years. Suggest buyers avoid Porter Cable in the future."
3,"Needs to have a 52"" fence option","I wish I could add another 5 * review as I'm a fan of DeWalt tools, but I have a problem with this base. The base is ""supposed"" to work with the 52"" table saw base, but compromises have to be made.1) No matter how you adjust the legs, you must shim the legs on the 52"" table. There is not enough play in the adjustments to do otherwise. As a result, if you have to move the saw around and your floor is less than level (whose isn't), you will have SOME degree of twisting of the extension table relative to the main table.2) When you do move the saw with the extension table, ONLY the saw is supported. The table is not. So you have a 52"" MDF table and it's hardware being supported by it's attachment points along one narrow edge of the extension table.As a result, I may look into selling mine and buying an HTC design which supports both the table and the saw."
5,Honeywell Charcoal Prefilter,Ordered one for the big unit and one for the smaller. The smaller filter was a few inches too high and just cut it off. The large one fit just right. Don't know what to say about the filter except I needed new ones and now I have them!
5,World War II Memorial book,I purchased this book for my husband who is a WWII veteran. He is also a member of the American Legion. He shared the book with other members of the American Legion. Several others planned to order after seeing my husband's copy. All of them thought it was a very accurate and riveting book.
4,It's a Sony product...'nough said.,"If you have ever used any of the Vegas or Acid products this product should match your expectations for music mixing (keep in mind the cost of this product when trying to compare the functionality to a full featured product such as Vegas). For some reason it seems that I have to switch tools a lot more than I did while using Vegas, but still the funtionalities I need are there. If you have not used one of Sony's video or music editing suites, there may be a small learning curve, but very well written and easy to follow on screen tutorials are included."
1,Not worth your time,"I try to not look at the Amazon reviews of a book before I start reading. However, when I'm unable to finish a book and become annoyed, a scan of the Amazon reviews almost always captures my thoughts and feelings. This book is one of those moments. Don't waste your time trying to plow your way through it.I'm going to give those reviews a little more of a glance in the future!"
2,Call me illiterate but I was bored,"After 2/3 of the book, I dropped it, and read the last 5 pages to further assure me I had not missed anything worthwhile. I have no idea what the hype was about. I was reading Moby Dick at the same time (diverse tastes) and reading ""real"" literature and this Light book that some purport as literature...puh-lease."
2,Not for all tastes,"This seems to be a love it or hate it work. I prefer a prose style that is clean and non-intrusive. Reading this was like reading through a layer of gauze. I found it pretentious, nigh unto plotless, and a major disappointment. It seemed to be working way too hard trying to be Important Literature.I do cheerfully acknowledge that it does appeal to some; I think the observation that others have made that ""if you enjoy Mielville you'll enjoy this"" is probably right."
3,"Don Vanpool's Review of ""What is Lean Six Sigma?""","I expected a short review of lean Six Sigma, but mostly found a quick reminder of some of the basic fundamentals of Six Sigma. For the long time Quality professional, this book is an expanded reminder of the foundational aspects of our movement. For the investment of time, it is worth while, however ""What is Lean Six Sigma?"" is more for the Six Sigma novice."
4,On the other hand....,Well here are the negatives... no video out.. no adapter available for 4th gen nano (chromatic)Contrary to what is written on the internet.. the HG does NOT charge 4th gen ipods. also to make matters even a bit more stickyit doesnt have a sync connector. (I use a sync connector to charge my nano on a mm50 which also doesn't charge chromatic) The problem is that 4th gens use usb 5v for charging older generations use firewire to charge the older ipods. (think about it its apple and the macs all were firewire) what will happen when usb 3 is mainstream?Sound is exceptional as long as it isn't cranked... contrary to other reviews elsewhere you cant get boombox sound out of it.. its a good (very good) small room speaker. If you want boombox volume and bass look at the kicker ik500 or ik501
2,Alarm cannot be set to specific CD track,"I like this alarm clock, but I didn't realize when I bought it that you cannot set the alarm to wake you up to a specific track on the CD. It only wakes you up with the first song."
4,Very good,"This is a great book, it really opens my eyes to women's issues in a religion that is obviously very liberating to women. I wanted to see what it was that was converting so many women to the religion and this book gives several answers as to why that is. I bought another one of her books because I really enjoyed this one."
2,Upgrade to Professional Version,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
5,The Time Saver,"I am a welder/fabricator. To me, time is money and this saw is a TIME SAVER! I mostly work with 2""x1/4"" angle iron, 2""sch 80 Pipe and 4"" channel. This saw is the best! Cutting time is literally 1/10 th the time of a band saw or abrasive cut-off saw and NONE of the of the clean up. I have 2 extra blades and alternate them at the sharpener. Unfortunately, I only get about 600 cuts out of a blade but, man is it fast. It's light weight and portable and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save time."
2,Multi Cutter Saw,This was a overpriced low speed chop saw that was supposed to cut steel with a carbide blade. I bought it to cut oilfield J-55 tubing for fence construction I could not get the blades to cut more than 15 cuts before they would not work anymore. This figured to cost me $7.00 per cut.The saw may work on milder steel but dont buy this to cut oilfield pipe.
3,Not quite up to the billing.,I have had the saw for a little over a week now. I have been satisfied with the speed of the cuts but am really dissatisfied with the amount of cuts I got before the blade had to be sharpened. I cut 14 ga square tubing and got less than 600 cuts before having to have the blade sharpened. As a result I am undecided as to whether or not I will be keeping the saw...
5,Must have for any Beasties fan,"If you havent seen this, you should. Even if you arent that big of a Beastie Boys fan, but like music and live shows, you should give this a watch. Really great music and movie. I still watch (well, just listen while Im cleaning, etc.) this frequently and I find something new to love about it every time."
4,Good dvd,Very good dvd. I've watched it a few times. Wish i could of made it to one of their shows before the death in the band.
3,It's Okay,"I bought this to get the Redskins burgundy color for a cake I was making. I could not get the burgundy color I was looking for, it didn't get as dark as I needed it to be. I know sometimes to get a darker icing color you have to give the color a few days to set in and I was trying to rush it in one night. I ended up using to much and the icing started to taste bitter, so I scraped that batch and ended up using red icing instead."
5,Great ideas in a nice sized book,"Though I do not recommend the authors book :""The Tiny House Book"", this book is great! Great photographs and drawn pictures that detail the building being written about. More of an idea book for the home handy person than a detailed instruction book, it contains enough information to easily build a number of the buildings illustrated. This book focuses on very small buildings most under 600 sq ft but the ideas presented could be used to build any sized home or out building."
1,MUSICIANZ WHATEVER,musicians are people who can play instruments this is just ying yaNG TWINS MUSIC WITHOUT KAIN maybe kain was somewhere getting high so d roc got his 2 untalwented siblings to rap with a very trashy album too bad lil jon's not on here it m ight have sold some copies.
5,Absorbaid helps!,"Absorbaid was recommended to help symptoms of my IBS...and it has done just that! I take only one capsule after each meal, sometimes two if I know I ate something that might cause a flair-up of my symptoms. Absorbaid is gentler than other digestive enzymes and has made a big difference for me and I'm very grateful."
4,A good guide,"This book is a very good ""guide"" to have if you want to start with parapsychology. It does not describe what parapsychology is, if you want that then this book is not what you want, but it does have a list of recommended books to read, webpage's to visit, journal to subscribe to, parapsychology foundation you can join and a lot's of more.A book where you have everything on one place and books that is worth reading (we all know how many parapsychology books there are and how difficult it is to find really good ones)."
4,"Too much ground to be covered, but ambitious nonetheless","This wonderful book has an ambitious scope - not only does it have a well-detailed description of the first magic item-selling shop ever published by TSR, it also includes the gold piece and experience point values of thousands of magic items - with hundreds of illustrations to enhance play! (So what does a currach look like, exactly, anyway?) Even better, from a collector's point of view, is the TSR Product List - a summary of every single release ever put out by TSR from the very beginning (1974) to 1992, complete with product codes. A veritable treasure trove of reference information for the discriminating DM!"
2,Over paid and over rated,Whilst the book itself is quite well written the contents reveal a professional footballer expecting sympathy for the fact that he has to travel long distances for out of season friendly matches and he had to sacrifice a lump sum payment to play for one of the best teams in the world. There is little real insight into the professional game or recognition that the top players are priveleged individuals who are extremely well paid but who have responsibilities to their adoring public. The book fails to provide a good insight into the pleyers views on the key issues facing the sport. It is a major disappointment.
3,British b-rated movie,"Not bad for a brit film. I gave it 3 stars b/c the ending was not predictable. I did however have to keep asking what the movie was about, and that is what sucks you in.British b-rated movie!!!!!! I thought he could be the next James Bond."
5,Good value,"I give this 5 stars based mostly on value. Good product for the price. I'm not a mechanic by trade, but I spend a fair amount of time puttering around my garage on small projects. I have the Waterloo PMX2704 Cabinet to go with this and they are perfect for what I need."
4,Inexpensive quality with one major problem,"The Skil 1840 is one of the least expensive plunge routers you can buy, but the low price tag is not reflected in the quality. The router handles smoothly and doesn't feel ""cheap"" in any way. The low price does make itself felt, however, in the lack of bells and whistles that are found in higher-end routers. There is no dust extraction system, no soft-start, no multi-position turret.The most serious flaw with this router, though, is its depth gauge. In a nutshell, depth adjustment is far from accurate, and is best described as ""eyeball and guess."" If accuracy of depth is important to you, you'll have to make several practice cuts in scrap followed by minute adjustments to get it right. In fact, if accuracy of depth is important to you, you're better off with a different router.Still, you can't beat the Skil 1840 for value. If you're on a budget and just want a quality router without the extra features, this is the one for you."
5,Great book,"As someone who writes about customer service, I found this book very interesting. It's an excellent read for a customer service representative and I'd recommend companies getting the book for each of their employees. It covers some customer service basics, how to handle certain situations, and is really a great overview of what great customer service is and how to deliver it."
5,The Book,"If you're in the need of a FORTRAN90 reference manual, here it is: don't buy anything else.This book contains everything one needs to know about F90. PAY ATTENTION: there aren't a lot of examples in this book. Just a few lines here and there. If you need a book like 'how to...' this isn't the one for you. Here ytou'll find every keyword, construct, syntax used in F90."
3,When it eventually arrives,"I still haven't received this item, when it arrives I will be happy, just hope it arrives before my son has to do his exam for this subject."
4,"Good story, pedestrian writing style.","I would give this book 3.5 stars, but since I don't have that option, I'll go with four. I enjoyed the North Carolina aspect, since I haven't read much about that part of the war. I also thought the author did a good job of portraying the caste system of the South outside the plantation/slave portrait most people are familiar with. His battlefield descriptions were also very good. He does write like a historian though, so the prose isn't anything special. There are also parts of the book that read like he just dropped his research into the pages. Still, I am looking forward to the sequel."
1,Total Workout,This is a DVD of a dance class filmed at Bally Total Fitness. There is no step by step instruction. The class is just going through the moves and the titles of the moves are flashed across the screen. Not at all what I expected. If you are looking for step by step instruction to learn the moves this DVD is probably not for you.
2,Don't waste your money!,"I spent $7 on this DVD and still feel ripped off. It was a tape of a class at Bally's with little instruction. The dancers in the background weren't even good and there was a 7 year old in there! I don't want to spend money to watch a class. I was hoping there would be combinations or something, and there weren't any. I turned it off before it got to the end because I got so bored. The shoulder shimmies lasted forever, to the point that it was just ridiculous. I haven't decided if I am going to keep it or not."
4,"Good, but for some reason not in CD player often","This is a very good album, but I tend to listen to the next two (One Hot Minute, Californication) more often than this.The ear is intrigued at first at the typical Peppers blend of funk and rock, charged with a creative sexual energy...also one of their trademarks (remember the socks??). But for some reason, with repeated playings, this album loses a lot of its edge...I guess the shock value on songs such as ""Suck my Kiss"" and ""Sir Psycho Sexy"" has been nearly eliminated on repeated playings, and that is what gives this album 4 stars instead of 5. 5 is when you listen to it for the first few times, and it makes you guffaw, dance around, and set up an Anthony Kiedis shrine in your closet because you feel the energy...the bloos sugar sex magik, if you will. But the magik becomes less potent as time goes on, unfortunately."
5,the chili peppers can't go wrong,"one of my favorite cd's ever. when i first got it, i only listened to tracks 1,2,3,4,6,7,9,11, and 12 (actually that's a lot of songs). but then i listened to the whole thing straight through, and its the best thing ever. there's not a single bad song on the cd. the bass parts are awesome (speaking as a bassist). definitely a great funky album that i would recommend to anyone."
3,Not bad!,"It has some bright spots, but I thought a lot of it was weak. Songs like ""Suck My Kiss"" and ""Give It Away"" are really energizing and catchy. But some of the others just felt tired and half-hearted. --Kelly Magovern"
5,Psycho is right!,"I couldn't let the opportunity to post a review about THE album that made me pick up a bass guitar go by. I used to have a copy way back when until I lent it to a friend of mine (who subsequently moved and was never heard from again) I finally was able to source another copy recently. In short the album is jaw-dropping. I am hard-pressed to pick a favourite from the album, but I think Sir Psycho Sexy, Funky Monks and Give It Away will always be up there. In short, whether you play a musical instrument or not this album drags you kicking, screaming and partying through 75 minutes of pure funk/punk/rock excess and the world would not be complete without it!"
5,A funky roadtrip,"Fantastic!!! So far the best album they've made. Although having made other great albums such the new one ""By the Way"", the magic on this album is outstanding and perhaps impossible to create again."
5,great,"this surprisingly was one of the last rhcp cds i got. wow thats messed up to even think about. this is the breakout album it set them off, released on the same day as nirvanas nevermind, it surpasses nirvana's completely because nevermind is slightly overrated and BSSM is not at all. notable tracks: the power of equality, suck my kiss, give it away, under the bridge, funky monks, if you have to ask, naked in the rain, i could have lied."
2,Good advice but way past its use by date,This is a huge collection of antiquated advice on marketing your business. Most of the recipes have shown to not be cost or time effective and so would be naturally avoided by even half-informed entrepreneurs. The authors have newer books out [2010[ so may be try those but I regret to have spent the $$$ on this one; it may not even be in my bookshelf in a week but disposed off completely.This was written in 19989 and reflects the technology from back them. Not by any means useful today!!!
3,It's a rollercoaster,"It's zombies, which I like. It's personal growth, which I like. It's a protagonist that's dragged from good to bad, to good to worse. By the time I reached the end of the book, I was sure the final ending was going to be monstrous. And it wasn't. Which threw me. It's an okay read, but I'm not sure I'd grab the sequel."
4,"Fun, Quick Read","I had a quiet day at work, so I read this book. A lot of people have compared the beginning to The Mist by Stephen King. I get that. I like The Mist and I don`t think that comparrison is a bad thing at all, but these stories are only similar in that they are about a group of people trapped in a store during a seeming apocalyse situation that there is no explantion for. If they leave, they die. This book does go into religion and I wasn`t expecting that. Some books in these situations do, but not as much as this one does. I liked that. I thought it was nice to see because it wasn`t over done and it was done it a well thought out way."
5,thanks,On time and just what was expected. thanks I am not sure what more to say except good job folks.
2,Not Impressed,I wish I wouldn't have bought this saw. I would be very willing to spend $50 more in order to get a saw the works well. This one just doesn't have enough power.
3,Sharing my shaver opinion,"Good delivery from Amazon of my Braun shaver, but I quess I didn't do the order correctly because I did not get my $50 coupon for buying Braun product in October."
1,Do Not Buy!!! Overprieced of Junk,"I purchased this thing a few months ago and it will NOT give you anything better than a stubble shave. I went back to using my Remington triple header.I wish I knew where I could turn this worthless ""razor"" in too.I bet this will not be posted on the review site.A totally dissatisfied cuatomer"
2,Not worth the price,"I spent a lot of time reviewing different shavers and this one had, by far, the best reviews. It was also the most expensive, but I thought I would try it anyway. I was very disappointed with the performance of this shaver. I had high expectations based on the reviews. The Braun 360 doesn't shave near as close as the $80.00 dollar Remington that I had been using previously and the Gillette Blade Technology doesn't seem to work as advertised. The shaver is comfortable and light weight and the cleaning system seems to work well but overall the quality of the shave is not even close to that of a razor or the Remington I had been using."
3,Not completely satisfied,"I got this as a gift, I like real razors better, and these units are mostly for people who want something close to shaved skin not really smooth skin.Not for me."
3,Meh,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad shaver. But after a month of owning this product, I don't think it's noticably better than the 7000 series shaver that it replaced. There's certainly not enough difference to justify the price increase (or the fact that replacement cutter block + foil packs cost about twice as much).My verdict: stick with the 7000 series. They work just as well, and you don't have to take out a second mortgage to buy one."
5,FAST!!!,"Not only do I use my shavers to shave my face, but also my entire head. This shaver is so fast! It used to take me 30 minutes to shave with my Panasonic Linear shaver, but now with the Braun I am completing my shaves (including my head) in less than 8 minutes! This shaver also saves me time with the automatic cleaning! My only complaint is that it does not shave *quite* as close as my Panasonic Linear, but it definatley shaves close enough in much much less time!"
1,The worst Shaver ever,"The thing simply does not shave. I have top go over the same stretch of skin several times in different directions, never had this problem with cheaper Norelcos. The result? Constant skin irritation.To add insult to the injury, Amazon is refusing to take it back. My wife bought it for me as a birthday gift, so it sat there for a week before I used the shaver. The instructions say to give it three weeks to get your skin to get used to it. As a result, the month return period was up, and now I am stuck with this horrible thing."
4,Better than all the triple header shavers,"I really like the 360 Shaver. I have used many triple header shavers in the past and it normally takes me one half hour to get a close shave. With this product, I can have a close shave in half the time. The cleaning mechanism is also nice, although I have not used it for traveling. I am worried about taking it on a long trip because of the need to use the big cleaner for a thorough cleaning."
5,Great Razor,"It cuts the beard, easy,and smooth,no pulling whiskers. Easy to use, fast clean-up.Overall a great razor."
1,Much money for a poor shaver,"Having had previous Braun razors, I decided to try this one given all the advertising hoopla. After about 2-3 months, I called Braun & told them I was very unhappy with the unit. They sent me a new set of blades.After about 2 months, the cutting was just the same as previously...very bad! I reverted to my old Norelco (about $40) got a new set of blades (about $20) and got a far superior shave than that from this expensive Braun. It was too late to return to Amazon and was stonewalled at Braun.I suggest that anyone contemplating purchase of this product think not only twice but three, four or more times. What a wate of money."
4,"work as described, but not perfect","The razor is not perfect, and I have to shave my face everyday now."
4,braun shaver offer,"love the shaver, but I was offered a 50 dollar Amazon coupon that I never received. Is this a amazon plot to make people buy?"
5,Great Product,"I bought this shaver for my husband and i cant say a bad thing about it. It was definitely worth the money, my husband says its the closest shave he has ever had. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family."
4,"Good, Solid value","This rip fence *should* come with the saw, but doesn't. It isn't fancy, and has no frills, but performs exactly what it is designed to do. I'd love it if Skil would include this one with the saw and offer one with a micro-adjustment at additional cost - but they don't do either of those things. Being able to find the right one to fit my saw at a reasonable cost is the next best thing. Thanks."
1,Not for the Bosch CS5 Saw,"While Amazon links this rip fence to the Bosch CS5, it is a Skill product.The miter bar is far too narrow to fit the Bosch slot (half the width), and the supplied thumb screw is too small in diameter for the Bosch mounting hole."
4,Wing screw doesn't fit my saw.,"If the wing screw which came with this rip fence fit my saw, I would give it 5 stars. Otherwise, I had to purchase the screw for $1, and it works great. I have a very standard saw, and am surprised that this wing screw didn't work.Other than that, I am ripping fool now, cutting down hardibacker, plywood, etc. Indispensable and cheap, this is well worth the purchase, and the search for a proper wing screw in my case.I do wish there was a feature which could bring the rip fence closer to the blade. I do a lot of trim work with hardwoods, and I would love to get 1/2"" from the blade with my high powered saw. Guess I'll stick to my table saw for now. Not sure how close you can get to the blade, but it about 2"" on my Bosch left hand radial saw.If you do work around the house get it."
2,too silly,"Sarah has many great singles, but not this one. It's very simple and silly and so far her first flop."
4,Excellent Quality Shoe,"The shoes were all that the advertisement said.They are very sylish, fully lined with a comfortablefeel inside and out. The only reason I didnt give a5 rating was the total fit. The size feels right inlength but there is a little more room overall thanI am comfortable with. If the fit were a littlemore snug they would be the perfect shoes. Overallthey are great."
5,A class act,"I bought this CD several years ago and it remains fresh each time I hear it. Every year, it's like a brand new Christmas present. The song arrangements and the execution are authentic and unique. These guys are no two-bit operation; they really know what they're doing. They know what to keep of the familiar, and what to play with. Clearly, they love what they do and they believe the message they're trying to convey. It's a simple pleasure to listen to this CD, and a great way to add a festive feel to your Christmas reveling."
5,Perfect Fit,"Fit perfectly into the grille of my 2002 Chevy Trailblazer. I had to clean some of the polish grease left on it, but it's very shiny and just what I was looking for. Much less expensive than buying an original one from the dealership and extremely easy to install. Delivered very quickly."
5,Great band doing a great show!,"This is the Allman Brothers Band doing what they do best, play live. Great versions of ""Rockin' Horse"" and ""Desdemona"", not to mention the 1-2 punch of ""Melissa"" and ""Midnight Rider"". Closing the show there's a smoking version o ""Layla"" sung by Mr. Haynes, that also provides a top-notch slide-guitar work to the song that would make Duane proud. You can't go wrong here."
5,One of the greatest tool ever,"This one of the greatest, multiple use little tools I have ever purchased. Its small size makes it easy to carry and handily available. I bought several and keep them all over the place, office, home and craft room."
5,Great,"The Follow Jade dvd's are great. There are two, one going to Kindergarten, and one going to the market. Only thing is that she teaches you the name of things, but doesn't teach you how to ask for it in a sentence. Hope she expands on that with more dvd's.Also, we love the Mei Mei DVD's. We have all of them. The best one is the Sing and Learn one because the songs are very catchy. We also bought it in a cd.Plus, we also bought this gorgerous ""ASIAN AMERICAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL"" from EBAY, and my daughter absolutely loves to play with the beautiful doll and watch her Chinese dvd's.Highly recommend."
3,Not as great as it sound,"I bought this based on great reviews I saw online. I loved that no batteries were required and my two guys, 2 and 4, wanted a race track. The race track didn't survive my kids although the cars did. The cars are in the diaper bag, ready for emergency play and they're a lot of fun. The track, however, is kind of boring. You can't race the cars and there's only so many times you can pull the car back and watch it go. This would be a much better toy if two kids could race their cars side by side."
4,"Great track, car OK.","The darda track is great. However the car only worked once, then it wouldn't work at all. The company was great about sending out a replacement motor, however it was very disappointing to have a new car track and no car to run around the track."
4,FAST cars!,My boys really like how fast the Darda cars go around the race track. Need to make sure the children use the cars correctly so they don't break.
3,Adorable -- but small,"This is really adorable... and I wanted a bag that didn't scream ""I am carrying an expensive piece of equipment"" the way most laptop bags do.This looks more like a tote bag, which is what I was hoping.But... I am definately gonna have to carry my laptop accessories in my purse or another bag.The bag snugly holds my computer (which is about 15""x9"" I think)... and nothing else.No room for CDs or DVDs or even the power cord.The outside pocket has no depth, and maybe you could slip a file folder or two in it, but that is about it.And the cell phone holder on the side looks cute, but I don't know many people that have a cell phone that narrow. And this is from a person who always wants the cutest cell phone.In short, it will hold my computer and look cute doing it.Nothing more."
3,not a huge fan,"I got addicted to this series to find out who was stalking, but this book was very disturbing. I was expecting it after reading the reviews but read the book to continue the series. Part of me wants to say it was a good book but part of me had a hard time reading some of it. The abuse flash back scenes were hard to read. All in all the series was okay. The story line of the brothers sharing their wives is different but hey its a story and suppose to be fun to read. The sex scenes were different and defiantly not romantic. I love Lora Leigh which was a big reason I started this series to begin with. I look forward to reading the 4th one jut to conclude it but not a book I could read over and over again."
2,"Disturbing, and then some...","*****SPOILERS*****Right on Donna Myers ""Book Worm""! Now, I don't have to think up what I want to say in a review, since you said it so well. I didn't mind that they were brothers and shared their wives, but what I did mind was the continually disrespectful way they treated their wives. The men acted like the women were so pathetic that they couldn't possibly tell them why someone was trying to kill them, and that the ""someone"" was related to Marly. Cade is an absolute jerk, and I would sacrifice him in a pagan ritual... If I could think of one..."
5,"Small, Lightweight and Functional, but Expensive","As nail pullers go, this one is first rate for just about anyone but a professional framer. It is extremely lightweight (obviously since it is titanium), but it is also well-designed with two pulling surfaces and excellent angles for generating leverage. It also has a design element represented by the hole near the larger head that allows you to access nail heads that are flush with the wood. This is a big plus and works well. If I were a professional framer, I would like the light weight and ease of use, but might be overly careful of it due to its expense. As a weapon for the Zombie Apocalypse, it would be nice as a backup piece, since you wouldn't get so tired from swinging it. I would, however, want it a few inches longer."
2,Too bizarre,"I made it through the first 200 pages, but I didn't get much further. I started skimming through the final 150 pages to see who was guilty of the murders.For one thing, the narrator, Frank Clevenger, spends too much time doing cocaine, and talking about his cocaine habit. And there was too much detail about Frank having sex with his girlfriend and the stripper he hooked up with (two different women). And the murders described in the book are really gruesome. Mutilation stuff. Gross.I won't be reading any more fiction by Keith Ablow."
4,I kept coming back to it!,"Frank Clevenger is a burned out psychiatrist whose present course in life can be compared to the Hindenberg. He is experiencing an on and off relationship with both his girlfriend and cocaine. Clevenger is called in as a consultant to a grisly murder in which the victim's breasts have been removed. Eventually the mutilations rise to four, qualifying the perpetrator as a bona fide serial killer. There is a thread among the victims though, and Clevenger will not like what he is about to uncover.Denial has great characterization. Several of the people have gone through horrific childhood experiences in which they have been abused. Keith Ablow is a practicing psychiatrist in Massachusetts and it shows in this book. The jargon and BKM's (best known methods) abound, making for an interesting read. I like to think of this book as a variation of The Verdict in which the loser gets one more chance to pull himself up from rock bottom. I do recommend it!"
5,dvb,"I did order this unit however,after getting it I realized it did not come with a mounting bracket(and you can not buy those separate) so I ask for a return thru Antonline and they would not provide because I had opened the product package(duh??) -so Amazon stepped in with their A-Z guarantee and made it right-however I did reorder the exact same three finger mount that was exactly for my C340 and it came with a mounting bracket and it is fantastic -so easy to switch between our autos and holds the GPS very securely in place. Definitely recommend it over the suction cup mount."
2,Does not come with stand,This item does not come with stand to mount to your Garmin. If you need all the parts to mount to your Garmin do not order this product. If you are replacing an old warn out gravity stand this will be fine.
4,not for the pro but still pretty good,So far i haven't had any of the problems other people mention in their reviews. i'm gonna say right now that this router isn't nearly as good as the porter-cable 8529 (my other plunge router) but the skil is the one i find myself reaching for the most. i don't reccommend using this router in a table (very hard to adjust that way) but as a plunge router its just fine.my only gripe about this router is the plunge lock lever needs some improvement.
3,Was this really on dvd?,Is this scheduled to come out soon or did it see the light of day already? I had the 4 VHS set but I want more!
2,Save Your Money,"I've always been a huge fan of the Ramones, but this album is junk. The best thing on it is ""Carbona Not Glue"" (great lyrics!), whihc was cut off of one of their earlier albums after a lawsuit. On thw hole, this album doesn't sound very good, and it is certainly not the Ramones at their best. It doesn't do justice to their talent. Stick to the studio albums if you want to know what these guys are capable of."
5,... magnificent glance & INTRODUCTION ....,..... TO THE MAGNIFICENT ..... PERSIAN CULTURE .... somewhat opaqued by western HISTORIANS .....ANCIENT HISTORY INTEREST ... has become a fast growing activity & OCCUPATION in my country ( COLOMBIA ) ... thanks to the excellent job done by reknown historian & narrator DIANA URIBE ...who's weekly radio show is broadcasted every sunday on [...] radio station ... appealing to thousands of history interested audiences ... which led to a succesful publication of two best-seller publications accompained of 5 audio c.ds each : HISTORY OF CIVILIZATIONS (2008)& HISTORY OF THE INDEPENDENCIES (2009)... consequently ...this special HISTORIC RELEASES are as valuable as any source of research... that I surely declare a must HAVE collectible.
3,Control issues... make a OK game worse,"Pointing to target with the remote and move the camera make this game an exercise in frustration. I liked some parts but the ""force ball"" that you roll around in is not a fine controled object and makes you have to try repeatedly to get across chalanges that wouldn't be so hard with a better camera and targetting method.. the guy who designed it should be smacked with a yard stick into unconsciousness"
4,What do you want- egg in your beer?,"I needed a hammer drill to attach ledger boards to my house's concrete foundation. This tool was 10 bucks less to own than a full-day rental would cost at the local Rent-A-Tent. I didn't experience any problems and I poked a dozen holes in the wall. It seemed to work as well as a Makita drill I have used in the pastOf course, when I see a tool start to smoke, I take a break. But that's just me. While I didn't wait for flames to shoot out the side to turn off the drill, I don't deny that more expensive drills with more metal parts will stand up to heavier, more prolonged use. But hey, I already have a good general use drill. I guess the question you have to ask yourself is, how often do you need a HAMMER drill? If you're Harry-Homeowner hanging some peg board in your basement you will appreciate how much better it works on masonry than a regular drill, and it's a bargain to boot."
2,"Skill 6443 1/2"" Slugger Hammer Drill","Im not impressed with this drill. It's ok with wood but the hammer is not that powerful, and it also neede regular maintenance."
4,Great Parallel Bible,"I love this Parallel Bible. (Except for the NIV, which after more than a little studying, I think is such a loose translation that in many places it actually alters the meaning of the original text! So much so that I would not recommend the NIV at all and, in my opinion, it should never even be considered for a serious bible study.) I love the NKJV and the NLT, but for a true understanding of every nuance of each word in the Bible you can't beat the Amplified. I have over the past 36 years read, studied, and referenced my Amplified Bible to the point that it is literally falling apart! It is not necessarily an easy reading Bible, but it is unsurpassed as a study Bible! I ""cut my teeth"" as a baby Christian on that version and it has served me very well even to the present day. Very, very contrary to the previous reviewer, I would not consider being without it! Today I am buying this reference Bible AND a new Amplified Bible as well!!!"
5,Royal Doulton Provence Rouge Light All Purpose Bowl,"Beautiful, durable bowls for everyday and more formal use. The only drawback is that they are deeper than other everyday bowls so they don't stack sideways in the dishwasher as easily; otherwise, I absolutely love them!"
3,I kinda wish it had been recorded 20 years earlier...,"I'm sorry, but this just absolutely is not Brenda Lee at her prime. It would've been nice to have heard here sing these songs during the sixties, and I will agree that maybe it's better to have these recording than not to have any at all. But unfortunately, the Brenda Lee here just isn't quite the Brenda Lee we all love to remember."
5,keep stackin,"I just want to start by saying 2 che is a bunch of guys keepin it real. The album is great the songs are great and the vocals are perfect. i dont know how yall do it but keep it up cause with these beats you'll be up there with snoop, nate dog, and dre. I think that the best tracks are 1,3,4,12,13. these are then songs to listen to. So i'm telin all yall gangstas out there who havent heard this yet betta get out there and get it cause your missing the real stuff. signed KH"
4,Star Trek- Armada,"What can I say?? My husband loves playing this game. He plays this game constantly. If you like Star Trek games, this gameis meant for you."
1,"Hardcore Fans, beware","I originally intended to purchase this book along with the two others that came out on the same subject. The West Wing is my favorite show, and I consider myself a very hardcore fan, one who can quote long phrases and cite details, if awoken in the middle of the night. This book has more errors in it than a 7-year-old's essay, and I felt I'd be better off never turning my eyes its way. It's just upsetting how little the author paid attention to what's going on in the show."
2,Buyer beware,"I bought this item for the $14 asking price and received it with a 25 cent sticker on it, which is what the buyer obviously paid for it. I really felt stupid...."
4,Good story for light entertainment,"Bob Hoskins plays Jack Moony, a policeman following a suspicious criminal lawyer played by Denzel Washington. The lawyer is murdered. The policmen has a heart attack and receives his heart from the lawyer. Now the spirit of the murdered lawyer wants the cop to capture his killer--he also wants his transplanted heart to be taken care of. Nice summer movie, light entertainment"
4,Heart Condition,"Jack Moony, a white cop, has it in for a black lawyer to the drug crowd, Napoleon Stone. That Stone is now dating his ex-girlfriend doesn't help matters at all. Stone is shot after Moony suffers a heart attack and wakes to find that he not only has a new heart, but that it is Stone's and that Stone's ghost is now his constant companion. Stone is insistent that Moony not only take care of his heart now but that Moony solve his murder. This movie is a fantastic action comedy where there are suspense, humor, enjoyable romance. A good movie and worth seeing."
4,Great bargin for the price,Nice sound. Nice features. Easy set up. To be honest I like almost everything about this unit. The only disappointment is there is no clock. I wish it showed you the time when it's turned off.
5,A Nice Region Free Upscaling DVD Player,"1. Remove discs from tray.2. Close tray wait for 'no disc'5. Press enter on remote. (There will be no on-screen response.)6. Press 8, 4, 2, 6, 9 on the remote. (There will be no on-screen response.)7. Press enter on the remote. Player will automatically shut off.8. Turn player on.9. turn off.10. Turn player off then on again.11. Player is now region-free.Enjoy your REGION FREE DVD PLAYER!"
4,Great beginners book,"So far it's the best book on building model aircrafts for beginners I've seen. Three column layout might be a bit annoying, but still I owe few sleepless nights to this book. The author guides you through building several models which get gradually more complex."
1,Horrible amount of time to receive this item,"I have been waiting over eleven days to recieve this book and still nothing. I received all of my other books that I ordered the same day. There is also no tracking number for this book. I would no recommend using this seller. I have never had an issue with Amazon, before this purchase."
2,wimpy heater,"This heater did not put out enough heat. it helped only a little, even when placed between two chairs and just above us. I would not recommend this heater."
1,Don't buy it.,Looks bigger than it is. Makes to much noise when the heater is on high. Does not heat much of an area especially if wind is blowing. After 2 uses gas leaked out of the side of the heater and almost ignited the wood table I had it on.
4,Protocols of Zion,"I gave this review 4 stars because of the concise nature of this documentary recounting Anti-Semitism in America.Very clearly this was conveyed within this DVD. I am glad that I did not pay attention to the myriad negative reviews on Amazon before purchasing this DVD. I wanted to see this documentary for myself before rendering any opinion.Mr. Levin painstakingly points out the prevalence of Lies and deceits over the ages. Overall, this was not boring to me and the clarity of the cinematography and the audio was crisp and to the point. I urge clear minded thinking individuals to view this, as I have and come up with their own synopsis of this documentary!"
1,Book Fell Apart,"The outside cover and back of this paperback comic book came completely apart from the pages in about 1 hour. Now, the pages are coming apart. The same thing happened to another Donald Duck comic book we bought on Amazon. Buy at your own risk..."
2,Slow and one port didn't work,"I bought this to replace a GS108 that fried after many years. I installed it with 9 ports used. Turns out one of the ports showed gigabit connection, but the throughput for the device was 10mBit/s. I plugged the same device into another port, and throughput increased to 100 mBit per second. Maximum throughput on transferring a large video file, both devices Gigabit Ethernet, was 120mBit/s. So, I returned this router and replaced it with a 16 port cisco that cost me about $40 more. All ports worked on the new device, and throughput - same two computers, same file - increased to 320 mBit/s. The Cisco router may well have been capable of higher transfer speeds - I suspect the transfer was limited by hard drive speeds."
5,Lovely on my dining room wall,"I really like this tapestry as it contrasts with my dining room decor very well. The tapestry is on a wooden rod but there is no hanging hardware included and you must provide your own mounting hardware. The bottom of the tapestry is weighted which makes it hang nicely. I purchased two white tassels (tiebacks) to hang on each side of this tapestry and it really sets it off very well and hung a sconce on each side, very pleased with this purchase. The tapestry reminds me of rococo paintings --all that is missing are cherubs and a courtier in a pale pink gown on a swing!"
4,Euro-Pro True HEPA filter,The Euro-Pro True HEPA filter work nicely. Since they are small you have to clean them after each use so they are a bit high maintenance but they work well.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. A friend emailed copies of the art to me from China. The images were in full color. I bought the book to learn more and for that purpose it was fine. However, the images were black and white and lost all vibrancy and dimension."
5,Awesome classic Castlevainia.,"This was the best Castlevainia on the Gameboy period. Awesome gameplay, some new tricks and great graphics for the time. Lots of fun!"
3,Nowhere near as good as The Unseen,"Thats it. I'll await the attack, but unfortunately too many reviewers are on Madlibs d**k, and can't see for the haze of pubes in their eyes.This new LP is OK, but you will find yourselves flicking through tracks you like as opposed to listening the whole way.Too many unfunny skits, movie samples et al do not make a good album.Madlib does need to go back to his old ways five or six years ago cause he seems to have been hanging out with Doom too much. Boring."
1,What Happend to Lord Quas?,"Firstly, I'd like to say that Quasimoto's ""Unseen"" is by far the greatest rap album of the underground scene to hit the streets. This new album, however, is AWFUL. The beats all sound the same, his lyrics are not as great as the first album, and his themes are whack. What was Quasimoto thinking when he wrote this stuff?Do yourself a favor and don't buy this cd, it sounds nothing like the Unseen and was a big disappointment.Peace"
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,I did not like the cord tether on this clip. The clip is nice and works as you would expect a clothing clip to work but tether for cord is not user friendly.
4,Works great if you combine it with a rubber band,"Other reviewers have complained that this clip won't hold their wires securely, and they're right.I can't believe the designers of this clip screwed up so badly and made a clip that's more appropriate for a high voltage wire instead of a little earphone cable.There IS a spring inside, but the hole is just too big for most earphone cables.I solved the problem by twisting a small rubber band around the wire holder part. Now it grips the wire tightly and can still be adjusted, opened, and closed.The clip that attaches to your clothes seems substantial enough. For the few dollars I spent to buy this clip, I'm totally satisfied with it. If I can figure out how to post a photo here, I will."
5,"""Amazon Verified Purchase""","The recipes in this book are very easy to follow. Most of the Ingredients can be found in your pantry or spice cabinet. The meal plans are great if you're like me and have trouble deciding what to eat for Breakfast, Lunch and dinner. The only drawback to this books is the lack of photo's but then again the price is right!!!"
5,Best Diet Cook Book I Ever Bought,I love this cook book. The recipes are delicious and easy to follow. Some of the recipes don't seem like they can be as few points as they claim because they are too good. I would buy this book again. It's great for counting points if you are doing Weight Watchers but the recipes are good even if you aren't.
3,"Eat well, quick","eating fast usually means fast food. Which I do not have the easiest time handling, besides, YUCK! This book will help you be able to gethome from work after a long day and have something tasty, healthy and more important, fast. Then force the kids to do homework, oh well, hapinessis short lived. Enjoy and be healthy."
1,Weight Watchers Make It in Minutes,I did not find any recipes that I would be trying. A lot of the items would have to be special purchase items bought in the grocery store and I do not care for that.
4,Weight Watchers Does it Again!,Weight Watchers never disappoints me. They have packed together a wonderful cookbook filled with great recipes. This book is colorful and has many pictures so you know what you are getting. I love this book as sometimes I get a little tired with my current menu of WW recipes. The recipes I tried were very tasty and quick and easy to make.
3,Not quite Superman,"The costume made my 4 year old happy but Everyone should know.....these are NOT superman colors at all!!!!! Superman's cape (or boots or shorts) are not supposed to be PURPLE! It is very disappointing. I guess that I missed looking for some real licensing logo....so this is not really a Superman custom. If you want a true superman costume....look elsewhere. If you don't care...its fine. Personally, I feel a little misled."
2,Peking Bag,"This bag is suggested for the Aiptek MPVR 6MP MPEG4 Digital Camcorder. So, I purchased it for this camcorder. Unfortunatley, this bag is too small to hold this camcorder!!"
3,James Ingram - The Greatest Hits,"This recording is nice, but I like the album ""Forever More"" which has many of the same selections. Given a choice, I would take ""Forever More""."
5,Deeply moving,This album is a real showcase for the depth of James Ingram's talent. He sings with deep emotion that sets it apart from many in its generation.
3,"BASIL DEARDEN, OPUS 35","Enjoyable British movie partly shot on location in the Egyptian desert. If we except a belly dancer and a few extras, there are no women to be seen here. Consequently Khartoum is a movie about men, about career soldiers, about politicians and inspired Muslims. Basil Dearden certainly knows how to give heart to the battle scenes with subjective points of view of the horsemen rushing into enemy lines or shots of grenade blasts filmed from below. Recommended."
3,As good as the book from Wilbur Smith?,"Watched this monumental movie after having the read the book from Wilbur Smith, The Triumph of the Sum.Although the main story remains of course the same the film does not provide the depth and different angles I was hoping for.Most striking is that I cannot remember one woman playing even a less important role in this film."
4,The vainest man alive,"Did ""Chinese Gordon"" suffer from Asperger syndrome (aform of autimsm) and was he a latent .......? Well, these issues are certainly not addressed in this classic movie which has Charlton Heston - well in character as the uncompromising, cold bath-addicted Victorian hero - cutting a swathe through rampaging hordes of whirling dervishes and Jihad-happy Islamic folk.By Jingo! It looks a tad dated now but Charlton cuts a dashing figure in his Governor General's uniform arriving at the Mahdi's camp. Sir Larry Olivier wins the ""ham acting of the year"" award for his portrayal of the gap-toothed Mad Mullah (""Oh my beloveds!"")"
4,Great CCTV Text Book,I purchased my first edition of this book in the 90's - this latest edition has been updated and includes the new technology in CCTV. A must for either students or professionals to keep handy. Well worth a read.
4,For Gene Tierney fans,"Lighthearted romp with the always dependable Henry Fonda, and the lovely Gene Tierney, who is always a feast for the eyes. The dvd quality is very good, but as with most mod titles could be better. Recommended"
4,Solomon's Club,This is an excellant game. No blood and guts and teaches you to learn reasoning and stratagy. It also teaches you patience. Three of the elements missing from a large number of young people today!
3,Nice B-sides,"This is NOT a real Dinosaur JR album but a new song and some B-sides. It's still fun to get though for this price. The title track and the live tracks are the best songs, but the other songs (mostly the acoustic Quicksand) are worth getting the CD for."
1,The name is not reflecting what I got,"The title ""Retractable Network Cables"" is not accurate. I thought I was buying a network cable (Ethernet RJ-45), in stead I received a retractable Telephone Cable (RJ-11). Not worth the return."
3,A bit wild for me,"I'm going to tell you like it is:I went in with the information given by ET Bell when reading about this curious character and came out of this book wondering what the hell? I looked on the back of the book - fiction. Thank God. Founding a religion on X? I had to check because some people are actually that crazy.Tom runs wild with imagination with Evariste Galois. It's a nice story for the most part, but there are some parts in this book where you just sit and wonder if Petsinis was bored, drunk, or a combination of the two when writing some of the stuff in the book."
3,Simple and affordable.,"Good buy for the price. My daughter said the wig was a little itchy, so I would buy the hair net to go under the wig next time."
3,Ughhhhh.,"I was so disappointed with this film. I search out and buy everything I can find on Baden Powell. Most of the time, sadly the result is pretty bad but this one is almost unwatchable. I gave this a 3 only because it is about Baden Powell and there is not that much out there on him. Otherwise I would have sunk it to a one.This director was more fascinated with filming Powell's eyeglasses, mustache and leg scratching then in giving us good visuals of a great guitar player. So much was lost in this film. It is a terrible shame since Powell is gone that this guy squandered this chance to document his playing better.This is art gone wild and horribly astray"
5,Still listening 20 years later.,L7 Bricks Are Heavy still makes the rounds in my car today. I enjoy all of the songs but my favorite is by far ****list. It's one of the great up yours anthems of all time. Simple and to the point.
3,It's OK,"I should have paid attention to the previous reviewer. ""Great product, however it seems that I did not receive an adjustable NPA. Instead of the orange one in the product description I got a green one- which is not adjustable. I mean- an NPA is an NPA. Good product, just now what was described.""I received a clear Soft PVC NPA. I'm not going to cry bait and switch over a $3.50 item, but come on now BP Medical Supplies, if I wanted an NPA without the adjustable flange I would have ordered one. Only 3 Stars because ""It's OK"""
5,recieved,I recieved exactly what was ordered in a timely fashion .... Thanks. If I needed again I would use them .... Again thanks for expediancy and accuracy
5,"Great Rythyms & Beats... Don't Fight It, Feel It!!!!!!","""Screamidelica"" is a genuine classic, from a band that is totally awesome. I never got into this album until I got the ""Trainspotting"" soundtrack, and then ""Vanishing Point."" This album is so incredible... it starts with a big bang-""Movin' On Up""... takes you ""Higher Than The Sun"" (twice)... and lands down on Earth with ""Shine Like Stars."" The whole album rocks, but I am particularly fond of ""Slip Inside This House"", ""Inner Flight"", and ""Come Together""- you will be fond of them too. If you are going to start off your Primal Scream collection start with ""Screamidelica""- a true masterpiece."
4,loaded,"my fav.tracks are ""higher than the sun"" & ""damaged"",which are heartening & high. i think overall Vanishing Point is as good as Screamadelica.it's glad anyway to see primal scream getting better all the time."
3,I don't get it... or do I?,"It's kinda hard to understand an album's historical relevance when you buy it 13 years too late. So I won't pretend to. All I can say is that if I heard this on the radio, I wouldn't believe it was all the same group. They don't even sound like they belong on the same record label sometimes. Still, if I heard it on the radio, I wouldn't change the channel. So what kind of music would I call it? I'd call it good early nineties music. No genre."
4,Was what I wanted.,"The song LOADED is the reason I bought this CD. It has some quirks/tweeks, what ever you want to call them that are,.....let me say this. ""A Little Ahead of their Times!"" It is all unexpected, but very well recieved. I can see why they were not main-stream, almost just a bit to _electiq(<Spell check), but I liked it! All I can say is this. Buy it! I bought it used, it is one you should have in your collection. GREG"
3,Not kitchen towels,"The towels are made of nice material, but even though they have a ""kitchen collection"" sticker on the back (presumably labeled this way in the warehouse) they really are golf towels. They certainly can be used as a kitchen towel set, but they are not standard size kitchen towels."
2,BMG should stay with their strength,"I have enjoyed the innovative and pecussive sound of the BMG for years. The addition of vocals has, in my opinion, really decreased the enjoyability of the group. I would hope that BMG would stick with their original success factors and go back to the pure instrumental sound."
5,FANTASTIC,Fun and intelligent. Extreme sonic depth - full of surprises but firmly rooted in rock & roll. I love this album. Great guest vocalists.
3,a classic,"a true classic. The original game that put the sega on the map, until sonic came out. A very short game, total of 5 levels. Very repetitive. But a definite must have for collectors of genesis games. It is available everywhere so it should not be hard to find."
4,A VERY GOOD INTRODUCTION TO ABSTRACT MATHEMATICS,"This book has an innovative teaching approach that encourages the reader from the beginning to work independently on writing proofs and learning basics of the discipline. The text is written in a precise and enyojable way, and therefore recommend it for introductory courses, or for people interested in learning basic math topics."
5,Gnomon always delivers,"This is a very helpful material, i've been working on max for almost 4 years, and I like the Lighting area a lot, have bought a book by Darren Brooker that is intended as an introduction to the various ways you could light up a scene.This DVD focuses more on a production workflow, it goes a little in depth on the various types of lighting rigs, their pro and cons, but one thing that i liked the most is where Tim introduces composition workflow to avoid re-rendering in early stages, he explains in not much depth the advantages of rendering in 32 bit depths (floating point)So if you have a little knowledge on lighting and want to learn on how to achieve better results and learn a little bit on composition, this is a good tutorial.Also Tim works with V-ray and Fusion."
4,"Would've received a 5-star, but......................","This film was banned in a few countries, and as a result the film went through a lot of editing; different versions. This DVD may be the closest you get to the original version; plus it has good bonuses. From memory, when I saw the film back in the day, the scenes with the child molester character had been extended. As a side note, I didn't know that in real life that actor was an Olympian athlete, and the girl that played his victim won an award for her portrayal in that movie. A definite superior addition to your DVD collection!"
2,"Plodding, uninteresting film","Supposedly this film has a cult following, but the only reason I can see for that is the stars: Jack Palance, Donald Pleasence and Martin Landeau.Donald Pleasence is the head of a mental ward and the patients escape. Sound familiar? Unfortunately, Michael Myers is nowhere in sight. The film just plods along while the viewer is unengaged. Nothing interesting going on here. Patients escape and kill a few people, but no suspense, no gore, the story isn't interesting, the characters aren't interesting and even the stars don't shine. Jack Palance has a halfway amusing scene at the end, but it was the only scene that reminded me of why I like these actors. A film not worth discovering, or rediscovering.The Image DVD is anamorphic widescreen for those interested."
2,Pretty average slasher film,"The premise of this film is exciting...5 maniacs escape from the local mental hospital and I think if this movie were re-made it could be pretty good. This is a slow paced early 80's slasher film. Good idea, poorly executed."
3,Good job-More action,"W.E.B. Griffin does the series justice in this episode however, in contrast to the others the book lacks action. Too much time is spent on the Germans in establishing background information at the beginning. The majority of the rest of the book follows suit to a lesser extent with character development, what each is thinking, and so on. The book flows well when discussing flying characteristics of a ME-262 or some other WWII aircraft, but these areas are fewer and farther between than in Mr. Griffin's other novels. A return to action is needed for the follow-on."
4,With what are we comparing it?,"While I would agree that this is one of Griffin's weaker entries, it is still substantially better than the best of most other authors. Interestingly, it was the third title in his Brotherhood of War series (The Majors) which I also considered its weakest volume, but it did much to set up the rest of that series. Similarly, his third Corps novel, Counterattack, spent most of its pages in weaving new characters into the continuing series. I think that the same sort of groundwork is being laid out here.Like one of the other reviewers, I purchase very few authors' work in hardback, but Griffin is one of these few (usually the first day they're available) and Secret Honor does nothing to change that practice."
2,Disappointing...,"This book gets the second star only because of the previous books in the ""Honor"" series and the books in ""The Corps"" series. There is almost nothing that happens in this book that couldn't have been covered in the last 10 pages of the previous book or the first 10 pages of the next book. 50% of the book was a summary of the previous 2 books! Don't waste your money on this book; you can catch up in the next book easily. Mr. Griffin, please do better next time!"
4,interesting start to a possibly excellent series,I first read this book when it was new in 1988. The characters were well thought out and the plot line was engaging. The author however left us hanging. What happened to Valk the Ear? Did she return and get him? At the end of the book the author promotes a second book but none was ever written to my knowledge. Ms. Salmonson if you are out there please finish this tale.
3,disappointing,"I really like Talking Heads, They are one of my favorite 80's bands. The thing is that I only like their popular songs: Once In A Lifetime, Burning Down the House, Psycho Killer, and one or two others. The rest of their music is much less catchy and original. I bought this because I thought it might be an album full of songs like Once in A Lifetime, but I was disappointed to find out that the majority of their songs are very poor creatively in comparison to their very popular hits. Of course their very popular hits are wonderful.So if you buy this don't expect to get an album full of songs like Burning down the House, you will be disappointed."
4,the last good Ministry album,"This is the last really good Ministry album, despite the fact it is basically a retread of the far superior Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste. Musically it's more or less heavy metal, with a few electronics thrown into the mix for some variety. A few slower numbers create a better sense of flow. In other words it doesn't just bash the listener over the head like some of the last few Ministry albums have. A keeper."
4,Your Ministry vinyl fix.,"Though I equally love the ""Rape"", ""Mind"" and ""Pig"" albums, it's hard to argue this not being their best release. Easily their most popular. If this was just a single with NWO and Just One Fix I'd probably still get it. Of course Jesus Built My Hotrod is here too, love it or hate it. Side two starts with the epic Scarecrow and brutal title track, then finishes off with some good noise.This album might be the best example by any band of hitting the perfect combo of industrial and metal. I've heard NWO hundreds of times, and it still blows me away. It's so damn mean. Killer artwork too, and 180gm vinyl."
4,A.J. does a brain good,"Like many folks, this was my first exposure to Ministry. Since then I've had the opportunity to listen to almost everything else they've released, as well as many of the recordings/musicians they influenced (NIN, Skinny Puppy, etc.) This album will always have a warm place in my heart, from the machine-rockin' ""Just One Fix"" to the Butthole Surfer vocals on ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"" to the ever-dark ""Scarecrow."" They even have a couple of instrumental numbers on this record that are a nice relief from the more typical song structure that is found on a number of this album's tracks. I'm more of a fan of their older work, and while this release is not as much industrial as it is rock, I highly recommend checking it out. And of course, ignore all the hype. Nothing like tons of hype to make a record seem much better/worse than it actually is."
4,This cd is smack!,"Seriously cool, super hard. Jesus Built my Hotrod is one of the hardest, coolest songs around. The rest of the cd is great too, some innovative stuff but not that much variety."
4,Great size,Hard to find batteries work great in my wireless drill. Really like the cylinder/modular design.
1,Trash...do not purchase,"I tried not to believe other reviews but ended up wasting my money. Bite the bullet, throw out the tools that use this battery and update your workshop. Trying to continue using this battery system is useless and dangerous."
4,Very good workout,This is a very challenging workout. You do not get bored because it is relatively short and it alternates between sets of ab work and sets of chest work. The only very minor complaint I have with the video is that the instructor does not count all of the reps out loud. This is a problem when you are doing the chest work such as pushups and you cannot look at the tv in order to keep pace with the instructor. After a few times doing the video you can figure out the pace pretty good though.
5,Intensity and complexity follows the traditions of The Real Thing,"A fantastic follow-up to the masterpiece known as The Real Thing. Funky is some places, hard core in others, Faith No More further defines itself as the protypical alternative ensemble. Angel Dust is and will remain an essential piece to the alternative rock collection."
5,Great to be English?,"Just been reading your reviews while browsing amazon.com. Then one thing occured to me. These reviews don't mention ""Easy"". And it isn't on the tracklisting, whereas it is on my CD. Is it a bonus track on European versions or what? If so, thank god I live here, not in America! But this is a quality album anyway."
5,Revolutionary to say the least...,"What can you say about Angel Dust? It has all been said before. However, every new generation has to be reminded of the importance of this band, and particularly this album. Faith No More changed the face of music, as it has produced Alternative music yet to be topped. This one has to be experienced, as it is one of the most important records of the 90s.I'm a Death Metal guy... that means I listen to: Opeth, In Flames, Soilwork, Arch Enemy, Bloodbath, Hypocricy, Carcass, etc. and I am the first to recognize Faith No More (with Angel Dust) as being the top of the line for Alternative music. I respect what they have done with this record, as they constucted a true masterpiece. An unorthodox masterpiece that requires many listens. Listen to this record and listen to history. If you're a fan of Rock/Metal/Alternative/Pop in any way, this album must be experienced.Faith No More is a band of champions. Mike Patton is a god among men."
2,not,this isn't so good i recommedn you to get real thing! there's great lyrics but the melodies are boring!
5,OH MY GOD!!!!!!,"This album is simply amazing. It will pull you in, chew on you a little while, and spit you out a sweaty broken little animal. The rollercoaster ride of emotion put forth by this INCREDIBLE band for the Angel Dust album will leave you shaken and crawling back for more like a beaten puppy."
5,Angel Dust a Must,This album blew me away! Mike Pattons amazing vocal abilities really make this CD.
5,Listen to this CD,"I was first introduced to Enya as a little girl. A short while ago, I found Michelle Tumes. Both have that way of inchanting small words and making words and music seem like a fairytale. This album of Enya's is a encredible work of lyrical rhythem and emotion. She makes everyday words seem like a fairytale in a forien langueage."
4,Beautiful Music!,"I was already familiar with this album. Nonetheless, listening to Enya is like a breath of fresh air every time. Her compositions are unusual, colorful and ethereal and put me in a good mood. Personally, Enya's music has helped me get through difficult times in my life. It really is THAT special."
4,Good album,This album had a wide variety of music that was enjoyable to listen to and allow yourself to go where you wanted in your own mind. I do recommend this and there isn't a whole lot of 'fluffy' stuff on it.
5,Life changing music.,"This album literally lifts your soul. It is so beautiful and so fluid, as if it is cleansing your soul. It is so inspiring and healing. The songs are so rich with imagery, leaving your breath taken away. I have never felt as strongly about an album as I do this one. It is definitely her best yet. It has changed my life."
3,Super Reader,"The first Bond novel not written by Ian Fleming, this book was written by Kingsley Amis under a pseudonym.In this book, M is kidnapped, and of course Bond has to rescue him. He has help from a Greek agent, and the title of the book is the name of the villain of the piece, a Chinese agent himself."
3,"Good, however it's the same thing as Turn on the Music","We had this video for years. It mainly showed hygene in Amanda Schlupp and some learning tunes were included. We had this as Turn on the Music. I can tell it's the same thing as this because it has the same people on the front. When we moved back to New England, we sold this video at our yard sale because it was for babies. If you want this and have Turn on the Music at home, don't buy this because it is the same thing."
1,Disgusting!,"We used to have this video and it just was disgusting (they made a mistake, it's Turn on the Music)! Chomping Gum was really disgusting, especially the teenage girl at the end, trying to close the drawer of the cash register and then putting her gum on it! My kids used to watch it! I almost barfed! We sold this at our yard sale to a lady who had kids. She's probably barfing by now! It's not a good movie for babies and it's a movie that makes you want to throw up!"
1,No help at all,"The wiring diagrams were no help all .There was nothing about the rear washer/wiper,nothing about the heater blower or the side door sensors. I will never buy another Chilton orHaynes manual again."
3,Eh....not impressed.,Doesn't seem to make any difference for me...bubbles don't come out either. Not sure what the purpose is and how it got good reviews.
2,Pronzini's done much better than this,"This is the weakest Nameless detective novel I've read.A couple of college kids go missing. Nameless traces them to a town composed almost entirely of bigots. Without giving anything away, I can only say that once a possible motive for murder is discovered (fairly early in the novel), the rest is slow going.Though Pronzini clearly has plenty of anger towards racism, he has no real insight to offer, and I didn't have much interest in seeing which of his mob of cardboard villains is guilty of murder.For a much better Nameless Detective novel, try Hardcase."
5,Vietnam Vet,"I recently purchased your book and happened to glance at the back cover. From that point on I could not put your book down until I had read it from cover to cover. I was memorized! I AM YOUR MOTHER!I'm a Vietnam combat veteran and used the same ploy as your mother - denial and never talk about it. My wife and three sons bore the brunt of my walled memories. And, unfortunately, in order to bury Vietnam I also buried most of my youth.I recently retired and the unexpected free time has caused my walls to crumble and my nights are filled with nightmares. Part of my counseling is to write about my trauma. You have inspired me to take these outpourings, organize them and get them published. I intend to ""look fear in the face"" and share my burden with others who may face the same hardships I do. Like your mom, I want to ""be here now."""
5,"Thank you, Fern Chapman","This book is easy to read but difficult to put down. It is also historically compelling yet has the ability to slap the reader with emotion. It is a story about the healing of two generations, a mother and daughter, during a trip back to memories that were buried deeply in the mother's mind. By returning to Germany, the mother is finally able to begin to heal, and the daughter is able to begin to understand a mother she knew only superficially. This author has bravely shared with us an unforgettable story."
1,RENT was STOLEN from Sarah Schulman,"RENT was STOLEN from Sarah Schulman's ""People In Trouble""...Check out ""Stage Struck: Theater, AIDS, and the marketing of gay America"""
5,"RENT it, buy it, just get it.","I've been a fan of RENT since the day a friend played the soundtrack for me. I adore the play, and when I got ahold of the book, I adored it even more. I finally realized how much work was really put into getting RENT out to the audience. I was especially pleased to see that no one thought they had to be extra nice when speaking of Jonathan Larson. They admitted he was pushy and demanding when it came to adjusting the play. I was glad to see that he was so committed to his vision that he fought to keep it as close as he could to what he wanted.At the same time, there are moments of plain sweetness to be seen. The pictures are wonderful. Including the note Jonathan wrote his father when he quit his job, and the shots from the stage. The picture of Collins and Angel is enough to make the book completely worth it.Wonderful for anyone who likes to see how behind-the-scenes really was as the group was getting ready for the performance."
5,"if you're a fan, this is a must-have","After having seen RENT several times, but never having been able to see the OBC, reading this book was like taking a walking tour of backstage during the days of the original cast. But not only that, it gave me so much more information on how Jonathan came up with the story and how the characters became who they are. It details very carefully and lovingly who Mr. Larson was, how he spent his time and the evolution of his idea. This book is chock-full of interesting, encouraging, and insightful information, and if you're a fan, not necessarily a total RENThead, but just anyone who wants to know a bit more about the show, I highly recommend this beautifully-put together book."
4,Good Coffee Table Book,"I wasn't a big fan of ""Rent"" until I saw the movie, and when I read this book, it gave me a bigger meaning to the play/movie.Warning: This is just for fans of ""Rent"". Those who haven't seen the movie will get into the story of how it was made, but not as much the screenplay."
2,copies with missing symbols still around,"I just returned to amazon.it a copy with missing symbols - it even misses two consecutive ""f"", i.e. ""ff"" wherever they can possibly occur. I loved the first pages, but going on that way was almost impossible - more a puzzle than a normal reading. So my review is not particularly on the content, but just in order to say that unfortunately wrong copies are still around"
2,Very Frustrating Electronic Apparatus,"Well let me start off by saying that this game is inhumane irritating. The controls are as slippery as games like Pagemaster and Decap Attack on the Sega Genesis. This Alex Kidd guy is weak as hell, the slightest touch sends him to heaven, literally. The stages become a maze after like the 7th stage, and the Rocky Mountain stage is one of the most grueling things you can accomplish in your life because of the awful controls. The theme of this game is also dumb, like why the hell would someone want to play a game where they play rock, paper scissors all day. The only way that this game can be beat is by trial and error, you would have to be extremely lucky to beat it without dying. The music is awesome in this game I would admit, but in a overall sense, this game isn't worth digging up to reexplore. Thank god that Sonic came two years after this game to save Sega from failure."
4,Quick charging for Skil batteries,"As this charger holds 2 battery packs simultaneously, you will never run down again in that weekend project (if you charge 2 batteries, to begin with).This is an excellent way to save time at little extra cost - When the first battery is totally discharged, just replace it with the other and keep working. You can even start recharging the first battery, while working with the second (in 3 hours it will hold enough charge to operate again).Nice solution for an excellent tool!"
1,Must have been defective!,"Bought this to replace my very old one. Upon 1st use, it overheated & stopped. Must have been defective. I have no idea if it ruined my older batteries or not. Can't return because by the time the new batteries arrived that I'd ordered the same day, the time was up for returns with the seller."
5,Great for the back,I purchased the upper and lower back package together because I have problems in all areas. I have been using this DVD for about a month. I do ultrasound and had severe pain on the right from my back through shoulder and arm. I have found much relief if I consistently do at least a 20 minute segment. I alternate and many of the exercises are similar in both with some more specific to the upper or lower. What I like is that he prompts every move including breathing and the movement. The movements are slow so I can keep up with them. One would think that slow doesn't work but I'm starting to feel more flexibility and less pain in all areas of my back and I'm seeing more definition in my stomach muscles. I like variety so having the 2 DVDs with 3 sessions in each is good although many of the movements are similar. There is also a segment that describes each movement and proper position. I look forward to doing these and feel that I need to do them or I feel more pain.
3,I like it but...,"Gets kind of stressful for my lower back after a bit, not bad but definitely a bit more tough than expected"
2,I thought I would fall asleep,"I know part of yoga is to be calming, however you have to get tot the yoga...He just goes on and on and on and on...by now everyone in the world knows what yoga is.Also the 3 segments are the same exercises...please...it wasn't worth the money"
4,Good DVD,I use this DVD 4 times a week. It helps with my back pain. It's not a cure but the main thing is to keep your back strong and clearly this is the therapy needed for that.
2,Wrong aspect ratio,"I'm not here to talk about the price, that has been talked about to death. I'm here to talk about the false advertising of uncut. They crop these episodes from the original 16x9 format to 4x3, which is just weird. I mean, we are in a 16x9 for everything format. And yes, it does make a difference. Characters body and heads are cut off. Words are cut off when they show the opening episodes cards. If any anime fans remember the whole crop fiasco of Dragon ball z from 4x3 to 16x9. Well, this is the same thing, but in reverse. I hope Viz fixes these on future releases, although the last 2 sets have been this way as well. Viz is only getting worse by: first the lack of extras, second, the price and less episodes, and third the crop of widescreen to 4x3. Viz do not care about there customers."
3,A little sticky and heavy,"I've used a ton of oils and treatments like this, and this isn't one of my favorites. I love Enjoy luxury shampoo and conditioner, but the shine and smooth made my hair a little sticky and heavy. Although it felt better once I dried it with the hair dryer, I find that the smoother oils work better and require less drying time. It did make my hair shiny, in a non-oily way, though. This is better than using nothing, but not as good as, say the L'Oreal Mythic Oil."
1,Beware of Bait & Switch,"I attempted to purchase this product on April 27 and I received the following email on the following day:Hello -Thank you for shopping with Good Looking Discounts. We apologize, but there was an error with this listing and we are currently working to fix it. The price you paid is for (1) Enjoy Shine and Smooth 4oz and that is what we will be sending, but we wanted to confirm it with you first. Please let us know if we can ship the order.Thank you,GLDSo it is good to know that Amazon tolerates shady business practices that make lesser online retailer notorious."
3,"OK, but not good enough...","The use of modern plastics instead of something that looks like bakelite makes it look like a knock-off, instead of a replica, which killed the retro feel for me. It was also difficult to tune accurately."
1,doesn't fit,"Just like the other review this does not fit. Holes are in wrong location. Maybe the manufacturer should actually try to install one before implying that they will fit. The studs are at least 1/2"" away from where they need to be now i will have to buy a different one and hope for the best or start drilling holes in my grill."
3,Barry's Opinion,"The video recording was too dark and Alfredo Kraus was disappointing in the tenor role of Edgardo. As always Giorgio Zancanaro was outstanding and despite a shaky start,Luciana Serra eventually became confident in the role of Lucia. However, the stand out cast for this opera for me is Pavarotti,Sutherland and Milnes."
5,Excellent Author,"While I have not read this book, I was one of Marshall's students back in the dark ages of computing history. :) His writing style and class materials were always top notch and well written so that people could easily understand the underlying concepts.I will be getting this book for my children as a Christmas gift."
1,Disappointed,"That was the reaction when gift was opened. I paid over $12 for the set, not counting the $6 for shipping. When I saw the set I tried to return it. I had to pay for shipping, HOWEVER, it was going to cost me over $12 JUST FOR RETURN SHIPPING COST. When I advised I had originally paid $6 for shipping why was it more than doubled to return shipping cost. I was told that sellers usually had set cost with whoever ships for them. But I had no choice. So I had to reluctantly keep the set. DISAPPOINTED was the look of recipient. Was suppose to be for 6yrs and up, not at all. Was quality of cheaper toy. Not as described. Some items cannot be returned. I would have had to pay MORE than I paid when I bought it. Lesson learned some of these descriptions are not quite honest. Will be more selective with sellers. I lesson that cost me over $18."
4,Does not include War of the Worlds!,"I agree that this is a great cd, and I enjoyed every story on it. HOWEVER, do not buy this expecting to hear War of the Worlds, because it is not included. As noted on the back cover, an ""introduction"" is included, but not the reading itself. I think it is misleading to use that story for the cover art, and to word the summary the way they do.Hopefully, you can enjoy it for what it does include, as I did."
4,Welles captures the essence of each of these classic works.,"Orson Welles uses his sonorous, mellifluous, matchlessly expressive voice and his legendary gift for characterization to delineate these oft-told tales in a way that will make you hear them as if for the first time. And if you are indeed hearing any of them for the first time, it will make you want to run to the library to read them and to savor them as they were meant to be experienced."
4,Don't judge a book by looking at the cover...,"""Duck and Goose"" look like they'll be simplistic and overly-basic -- both the artwork and the text are deceptively plain... But these two little guys actually have a richer and more believable emotional life than many picturebook characters. They might not have a long shelf-life (kids will probably move on past them fairly quickly...) but while they are your book friends, your lives will be enriched. Definitely worth checking out. (ReadThatAgain!)"
5,sweet,this is such a sweet book. it's funny the way that the characters speak to each other and the resolution is hilarious to my 2 and 5 year olds. nice bright pictures
3,Just ok,Was expecting this to be a detail by detail account with vivid pictures and instructions on what proper table manners were. It was not what I was looking for.
3,Cleans well,Works great but can eventually she the dirt build up the pad even with cleaning it after every use. One pro is that my skin feels great..
4,A worthy effort and historical gem,"This is my rebutal to the ill advised likely a bit youthful fantsy or drug induced ""review""posted. This is a book about people many Americans who worked the coalfields (mines) of Colorado the late 19th and early 20th century.The reviewer is likely ""on drugs"" or worse. It's(the book)about people;mostly immigrants as my famiy who worked in the mines and died in the hundreds but many of their children went on to become America......The negative review should have never been printed as it is not a review but some likely racist and sad soul playing around with a serious facet of how America was formed into what we are today.It is an honorable and important book that documents life that was harsh but full of promise for America: coal was fuel;fuel equated America's future: to supply the world with the tools to stop wars of aggression.......it is simple:how the West was won.........Joe ""Doc""son of a coalminer;grandson and more....."
5,"Duran, Duran...??","Dude, What??? This band(Led Zeppelin)is one of the most influental bands of all times! Haven't heard to many successfull bands quote Duran, Duran as one of the most important bands ever. You better re-think your comments. This music is great! Bonham kicks serious butt on this album. That's all I can say, he was the best drummer ever!! Buy this album! I have to go now, I have to go listen to my Wham album! Amateurs!"
4,Could be better,"Jimmy Page tries to make a perfect product when he should leave well enough alone. Anyone who owns the bootlegs of the two shows which make up HTWWW knows that we're missing some tasty treats from both nights. (Louie Louie from the 25th and Blueberry Hill from the 27th, for example.) Find the bootlegs and give 'em a listen; you'll thank me later.When Page finally gets around to releasing what's in his vault like Pearl Jam, The Dead, and Phish are doing, I'll start buying the live shows, but for now I'll stick with the unofficial live recordings."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this because of great reviews, nothing below 4 stars. I have Mothership and have owned the old albums, but I am comparing ""How the West was Won"" to ""Mothership"". HWWW has little bass, which was biggest disappointment. The studio cuts rock with clear deep bass while HWWW does not. Second, the long versions become tedious, especially Dazed and Confused. There are long stretches where they are just tapping drum sticks. I can't imagine what the audience was doing. I have never been to a concert where this would have been tolerated in silence. Not recommended."
2,Be careful when ordering,"I ended up getting a refund as this was not what I had hoped to get. The shipment included two dvd AUDIO disks only. I could only play them on my dvd player, and they displayed a still shot for each song. NO VIDEO. The seller claimed I got what I ordered, but both the Amazon and their(Caiman) descriptions mentioned a dvd. Thanks to the Amazon guarantee, I received a refund. Thanks guys."
4,"Always nice to have ""live"" Led Zep material","Some good ""live"" cuts. Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp and Bring It On Home are my two favorite on this release. Always nice to get any ""live"" Led Zep on cd, I would also recommend the recent ""live"" DVD release. If you do pick up the DVD, you may also want to check out the BBC Sessions cd, also."
5,Better late than never....,"The live CD ""How the West Was Won"" is excellent (I wish I could have been there to hear them in person)!!! The sound quality is excellent....it is very much like the double CD released a few years ago (Live from the BBC).Led Zeppelin are truly masters of imprvisation. We all know the songs; but they are performed as though I have heard them for the very first time. My personal favorites on the CD are ""Since I've Been Loving You"" and a nearly 26 minute long version of ""Dazed And Confused.""Also included is John Bonham, performing an excellent solo on ""Moby Dick"" (a fitting tribute to the best drummer ever).Led Zeppelin fans: THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!"
5,Very Good,"This CD is good. Im not sure its better than the 71 live bbc cd they released a couple years back, but it has a few more tracks, and the sound quality is a little better, a little less bass heavy as well. Page was ripping and Plant still had a great voice. Only a year later at the NY Madison shows (Song Remains the Same material) Plant had lost the top end off his voice (thats why you dont hear Immigrant Song or the high parts of rock and roll etc...). So this in my opinion is one of the last great zepplin tours. From 73 on it seems the crew were pretty into drugs, bonham is fat, plant's voice is cracking all the time, page is sloppy. Listen to the bootlegs and you'll see. But this is a great show, as were almost all shows before and up to 72. That dumb [*] who said Duran Duran was a better band and better musicians needs a beating."
5,So This Is What All The Hoopla Was About!!!,"There was such a cult feeling surrounding this group when they were huge in the 70's, and their previous live offerings don't come close to showing what this group was capable of. This release, however will not only refresh the memories of those who knew, but a new legion of fans can now become obsessed with this supergroup. The 3 cd set gives each member of the group to shine, but it is truly the Jimmy Page / John Bonham show. Zep was obviously focused at this time in their career, and it shows. Buy this set and enjoy...."
2,very disappointing,"For years I heard the hype about live Zep not being fully captured on Song Remains the Same. Much of this hype is repeated in the many reviews here. This band was my first great rock band love, and Jimmy Page is why I play guitar and own a Les Paul. I was so excited to learn of this release and grab the discs. But--wow, the band was weak at these shows. Jimmy is sloppy, random and soul-less, and Bonham and Jones can do no more than pound loudly along under him. I wondered if I had just outgrown the band, so I just listened to No Quater and The Rain Song from Song Remains the Same, all of Presence, and the studio Dancing Days and The Crunge-- No I haven't outgrown Led Zepplin, they were brilliant. This release, though, is just for the those who like it very loud and very simple. I can't recommend it."
3,The Bloated Excess of the 70s,"Ok, there are some great moments on these three live discs, I admit it. But, 23 years after this band dis-banded, do we really still need ""new"" albums from them. Is Jimmy Page still really hurting this bad for money. I thought he was really just trying to cash in when he did that Coverdale/Page album. Led Zeppelin is the great hard rock band of all time, but how many more 20 minute versions of their songs do we really need to hear? Get their original albums, and leave it at that."
4,Another good one,I've been playing the Need For Speed series since its introduction.This is another good one.
5,Pure Brilliance!,"Found this book in Greenwich Village on my last trip to NYC. I was just flipping around and waiting for my friend to finish browsing; so I opened up this book and started reading. Every poem is a paragraph long, under a page in length, and by the time I had read two or three of them, I couldn't put it down. It was so real!!! I left the store with this book that day and have purchased several others (including ""Nice Fish"" and ""Just Beneath the Water""). Buy him, read him, love him!!! I went to Duluth, Minnesota, last year to see the area he often writes about. It is incredible too!"
1,Avoid,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. What I was looking for was a quick introduction to give me a grasp of the basic concepts of NT Server. What I got instead was a book that is extremely lacking in direction and filled with jargon it never really fully explains. It does have some useful information but it's so misplaced within the text that you kind of have to know exactly what you are looking for to find it. Even then it leaves you hanging. This book proceeds to tell you things like (and I quote) this feature is ""one of the most powerful methods available to administrators"", however it ""is beyond the scope of this book"".Don't waste your money on this book like I did. Instead pick up any book by Mark Minasi like the one in the Sybex ""Mastering"" series. That guy is just plain awesome. He is probably one of the most talented technical writers I have read. You read his stuff and all sorts of lights go on in your head.Cheers."
4,Excellent supplementary book,"Simply stated, I don't consider this ""the book"" on the subject, but it is a most-have. It begins by developing some of the mathematical foundations needed to solve the problems; followed by some Newtonian mechanics (basic concepts: force, energy, motion in 1D-3D, and many examples and applications), and ends with special relativity. The topics are presented in a clear and straight-forward manner, although some of them were too simple and not as thorough as I wished.This book corresponds to a regular 1st semester in mechanics. It should be complemented with the second book (Classical Mechanics) which deals with non-inertial reference frames, systems of particles, rigid bodies, Lagrange equ. and Hamiltonian Theory.I give this book 4.5 stars (I'm a tough grader)"
1,I love all of Neil's offerings ....but....................,"I saw that incredible 1990 tour and it CRANKED!!!! Also, Neil is probably one of my favorite performers and I can find something to love in just about every album he has released. Dare I say I even love: ""Life"", ""re-ac-tor"" and ""Trans""! However, another reviewer keenly noted that ""Arc"" really can only be listened to once, therefore, it should not be purchased! It is not even enjoyable on the first listen. It is downright annoying after about 3 minutes but you feel you should suffer through, after all you just paid the $15 or so.This so called ""album"" is Neil's only mistake in his wonderful career."
2,Arc,"Arc is a must have for feed back freaks- its a bit tough- I think seeing Neil Young live and watching him prowl around the stage immersed in his music is something that shouldn't be missed, but to be sitting in your living room listening to feed back, As I said its a little tough."
1,audio torture,"buy this cd if you want to tourure your friends, or clear the house after a party. one long painful shreik of a collage of ends of songs. sometimes neil young is simply out of his mind. stay far, far away from this one unless you want to play a cruel joke on someone (and all the yoko ono cd's are sold out). one star was awarded because zero wasn't an option. you have been warned!!!"
1,Know about MRP? Dont buy this book!,"If you know anything about MRP or you have the instructions that come with Navision, then dont buy this book.This is a lame rehash of basic instructions on what the individuial fields are and has little or no explination on how to put it all together.It has no advnced ideas on how to improve the use of Navision.Scott Hamilton has copied the help files on field names and then put them in a book. There are small sections on how a company may use a section, however these are around six lines of vague text, not of use to anyone.Basicaly it is a dictionary. The help that come with Navision are of more use.Unfortunatley I purchased this one, however you may benefit by looking elsewhere for another option."
5,Accumulaire,Awesome and for the price you just can't beat it. It came earlier than expected which was also great. I would order this item again.
5,This is my all time favorite CD.,Jane Siberry is God and proves it here with When I was a Boy. This CD is full of beauty and emotion and really showcases Siberry's talent.
2,"Like a jazz open mic -- good for the performer, weak for the listener","I love Jane S's voice and got this CD because her version of ""Calling All Angels"" was the song my son and daughter-in-law danced to at their wedding. The rest of the CD just doesn't appeal to my taste -- a little too ""experimental"" and what I'd call non-musical."
3,Unique,"Soul-full emotions from the core of hurt and success. Most likely hurt first and then success. If you're in a mood to listen to words and let them touch you, this is a CD for you. Some of the music accompanying the lyrics is good but does require an open mind to appreciate Siberry's expression of the art and her interpretation of it.Reflective, different, and a bit depressing, but still unique."
4,dryer=death,"you know how when you wash something cotton and air dry it, after that you can put it in the dryer? this theory does not apply to the mop pads. no. not at all.you may have luck dampening the ubershrunken ones to get them on, but don't be like me and think, ""oh, it's just that the drawstring shrunk. i'll cut it off!"" because that, friends, is a bad idea.this mop is basically the greatest invention since the gutenberg press, especially when paired with the dirt devil sweeper vac or some other stick vac+swiffer combo. hi, i am lazy and have a bunch of animals and these are a total dream. when i pick all the laundry up off the floor, i can actually get it clean in no time.anyway, just bear in mind that AT NO TIME should these mop pads go in the dryer, however desperately you may want them dry."
5,Break Out the Cappucino and Biscotti!,"I love operatic arrangements for small ensembles--which on this CD include accordion, oboe, violin, viola, mandolin, cello--and a violinist with a marvelous voice! Quartetto Gelato has fun with Donizetti, Puccini, Ravel, Bach and others. Some traditional Italian songs had me reaching for the cappucino. And just for spice, they toss in ""Dark Eyes,"" ""Danny Boy,"" and a Russian Medley that will have you dancing around the living room (close the blinds first!). All of the pieces are extremely well-played. Listening to this CD will make you happy."
5,Good alternative to fictional movies,"My eight year old son really likes this movie. I got it for him because he watches too many fictional shows and I thought this would be a nice change. He finds it entertaining and informative, so it was a good choice in my opinion."
5,Swords Make the Flag,"Out of all the Jolly Rogers that you can buy I found this ""Brethren of the Coast"" model to be most appealing. I ended up getting two for use as backdrop in a series of videos I've been making. As for the other versions, I don't like the red that's in them as this is more sedate than most of the others. Really though, the cutlasses add a bit of flair and grandeur to the effect and are better than bones. With all of these flags it should be remembered that polyester is not an outdoor material. If you buy this for the purposes of flying it indoors then you'll have no problems. Young Jim, the pirate flag certainly is a jolly bit of good fun."
2,I suggest Sviatoslav Richter,"With nothing but good intentions, I suggest that the recording of this Bb Schubert Sonata by Sviatoslav Richter is unequalled. Other pianists are good; Richter is great.Richter is, simply put, a genius at the keyboard, and this most memorable Sonata by Schubert allows him to express his mastery of not simply the keyboard, but of the music itself.I have several of Leif's recordings, and while he is a decent pianist in one sense, I am always left wanting more; sometimes even a bit confused...a feeling that is satiated immediately after swapping Leif's recording out and Richter's in."
5,An Overlooked Billy Crystal Classic!!,Rabbit Test is an overlooked Billy Crystal Classic.It's a must see especially for Crystal fans!!
3,An Enjoyable Book for WWII lovers like me.,"I read this book when I was 12 or 13 and loved it. These three young boys who defied Hitler who was one of the biggest leaders of the time, was putting their lives in danger. This book made me want to stand up for my beliefs a lot more and not worry about what people think. It was a good book and I highly recommend it!"
3,Some news,"According to AMG, THE GIPSY has been rereleased, with its lovely gatefold cover intact, on 180 gram vinyl LP in the UK. And, it contains the brilliant Carol Anne Pegg arranged song 'Mendle' (not Grendle-as was prev. noted), astoundingly left off the 2-for 1 CD."
5,The Arnica Rub,"Wow, this product is amazing. I live in Australia and we have nothing this affective. I have Plantar Fasciitis and this product has helped so much, I use it about 3 times a day and almost pain free. Highly recommend this product."
3,"The Rub, Arnica cream",The item is just what I expected and works well. However the cost of postage was exorbitant and the length of time to reach me was six weeks.
5,OUTSTANDING,"i stumbled across this book in the library, sheer accident. I am glad i did. After reading it, I immediately bought the trilogy. cover to cover, it was read. Jim Hollister is currently my favorite literary character. Well written and plenty of action. I learned alot from these novels. Dennis Foley is a MASTERFUL STORYTELLER."
5,Trumpet mouth piece holder is great,This item holds my son's mouth pieces. It seems to be working out fine. Quality is good and so was the price.
4,Fun toy,My son loves this toy. He has played with it daily. It does not hold up well under rough treatment. He has dropped it a few times (on carpet) and I have had to glue 2 of the corner bolts back together. It is still much sturdier than the cheap versions that have plastic pins.
2,Broken on arrival,"I went ahead and bought this even after reading other negative reviews...I should have listened. One of the corner pegs holding it together was broken when we opened it. A second one (on the same end) broke a few days later. Now the two black panels are coming apart and the pins are all out of allignment. My son was so excited to get this for Christmas. It's such a disappointment to have it break only a couple weeks later. I guess that's what you get for only $14, but it's not worth that amount either."
1,pin art,it is AWFUL !!!!very dangerous as the pins are very sharp.. DO NOT BUY THIS IF THERE ARE YOUNG CHILDREN AROUND !!!
1,arrived broken - twice,"I ordered this for my niece for christmas - was really excited about it. It arrived broken - half of the plastic screws that hold it together were broken. I sent it back, they sent another one - and same thing happened again. So, Amazon has a great return policy so that wasn't an issue - now I Just don't know what to get my niece for christmas!!"
3,sizing slightly off,"A great pair of shoes, fairly comfortable, and gorgeous, but I feel the sizes of the two individual shoes was significantly different. Nothing unmanageable with the use of some padding, but a little irritating.Also, the lace inside can be a little uncomfortable, so the pads are definitely necessary."
4,as a mother of 3 kids on the spectrum,"Wow, loved this book! Such an interesting and different POV (an autistic teenage boy). I loved getting into Christopher's mind, it was really unique. I would've given this book 4.5 stars but didn't like the way his parents treated him."
4,"Disturbing, Enlightening - and Simply Wonderful","Without going into all of the details of the mystery of autism, let me say that this is a truly wonderful, personal narration of a guy named Christopher, with many clever and witty diversions, and yet still a story of heart-rending compassion. Some small bits are a tad tedious, but that's a small price to pay for Mr. Haddon's personal experience and humorously wise tale of a child in pain, striving (almost valiantly) to become one of us... although maybe that's not the smartest of desires. Give yourself a treat and read this as soon as you can."
2,Bad ending,"Interesting book, but it left you wondering what happens? Plot needed to be developed a bit more, as do some of the other characters."
5,best on CD,"I think the 6 hours of CD listening is the best way to absorb the book since you can slowly get the deatils of what the autistic protaganist is thinking.By the way, one reviewer notes that the author is wrong about the math puzzle mentioned. The reviewer has also been fooled, along with some mathematicians. I didnt understand it the first time either, but the solution in the book (as Marylin Savant writes) is correct."
4,A great book,"I read the book because my son has a mild form of autism, but much milder than the boy in the book. Explaining to family and friends what is different about my son is difficult and I hoped the book might be one way for others to see things from an autistic viewpoint. The book certainly explains well what life can be like for those who are autistic, regardless of how severe or mild the autism. The story line itself was a real treat, and interesting but the love the father had for his son was most moving. The frequent use of expletives is something to consider when recommending the book to others."
3,A Most Read,"The author writes about how Christopher thinks, which interests the reader. He thinks like an adult at times, and in a split second he is thinking like a two-year-old. This character shows how everyday situations can be interpreted differently. Thoughts aren't always wrong, right, good or bad. Perceptions of events are important and always vary among individuals. I learned people have different perceptions of the same situations. I can't say I understand all behavior disorders but I can say the book made me more aware. I can at least show kindness and patience to all people. It's not everyday a book can be enjoyed for the story and appreciated as a learning experience. I'm able to appreciate thegrowth and change in my own life. I owe Christopher a big thank you."
3,"amusing, informative.......",the title itself is enough to catch your attention! A wonderfully funny book that makes you relate to the world of autism and wonder if we're all really THAT different inside....
2,Boring!!,"I read this book because it recieved so many good reviews, and was very disappointed. I thought the plot was dry, I didn't care about any of the characters, and there was absolutely no suspense. Unless you want to understand how a autistic person thinks I would not recommend this book."
3,okay,"I enjoyed this book, but it was just okay. Frankly, it's not really a book for adults--it's a kids book, and the author is a children's book author. It's being marketed as an adult book, and I'm not quite sure why. Like most literature for children, it's fun to read, but it's only skin deep. You will forget this story as soon as you close the covers. So if you want to spend your money on a book that you will enjoy for about two hours and then forget about, then go for it. For me, however, I wish I would have waited for the paperback."
3,ok.,"It was a good book. I had to read this for summer reading. The only problem was that the main character, Christopher, would often go into random ramblings about math and random things that the reader didn't really care about. I understand that he was autistic, but seriously! I liked the actual plot, and that's about it."
5,Buy this book!,"A librarian, from Frostburg, MD:Perhaps the most amazing quality of fiction is its ability to put us into the heads of those who cannot - or never get a chance to - tell their own stories. THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIM is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too. Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love.Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez"
5,Must read.,"Quick, good read. Gives a glimpse of the autistic thought process and world. I especially enjoyed the clear gems of wisdom embedded within the story."
1,Weak,"If you don't like Catcher in the Rye, don't bother reading this. I should have listened to the reviews I read comparing the two. Pointless rambling....."
