1,nothing to review,"Difficult to review. I have not got the order yet. Lately, it takes ages until I get the orders. So, once I get it, I will see."
4,leaves a little on the table,"im not a follower of garmarna, but i was neither delightfully impressed or dissapointed with this purchase, the nordic vocals offer a change of pace from most hildegard modernists and sometimes the strings seem to cover them up"
4,"andrea martin is a well kept secret, ready for release","i am very pleased to have met and interveiwed Ms. Martin. her debut cd is a collective compilation of accoustics, tight beats, and an innovative inclusion of carribean influence. under her writier's belt she has, (Monica) Before You Walk Out of My Life, (Toni Braxton) I Love Me Some Him, and (En Vogue) Don't Let Go Love. As an artist, Ms.Martin is sure to sore even more so than as a writer. The first track of her new cd is my absolute favorite (Let Me Return the Favor). Her choice of Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill as Producers on a couple of tracks, was definatly a wise decision on her part. I am not an easy ear to please, but Ms. Martin has won my vote!!!!"
4,un-noticed,"I'm very surprise to see this artist on your website.She's very under-rated.She worked with many known artist,haven't received the recognition she deserves."
1,worn out after 3 months' use,"Very disappointed! Bought a new one in Aug. for my Son, after 3 months' use (about 3 wears/week), it is completely worn out!"
1,Mike Batt FAILS,"I guess Mike Batt can't get it right each time. Vanessa-Mae... fantastic. BOND.. Absolutely GREATThe Planets?....CRAPThis is just sad. If you want to hear crossover done right, get Vanessa Mae's best of and bond's born, shine, or classified."
2,Try Something Else,Not very helpful. The practice questions are too easy and too few in number to be helpful for the 70-087 exam. And the layout drove me buggy. Sorry Sibex.
2,Not a very helpful book to pass test or understand IIS,"I've been using Exam Cram/Transcender to get through the first five exams for my MCSE (TCPIP was other elective). I felt that they were the best and fastest way to get MCSE'd. When I started looking into materials for IIS, this book was recommended over Exam Cram. I found it very difficult to get through and not very useful during the test or for understanding IIS in a meaningful way. I think I got used to EC's straight forward, direct style and couldn't go back to this checklist, ""light"" style. I don't know if the EC book was really that bad or if Corlois has improved it so scan it at the nearest bookstore. Otherwise, if it weren't for brain dumps and cramsession, I'd still wouldn't have my MCSE!"
5,Van Morrison is STILL putting out quality music,"Each of Van Morrison's CDs in the 90s has been of quality. His prolific music writing is impressive. Before I listened to ""Back on Top"", I thought that Morrison might have run out of creative music. After listening to the CD, I quickly put that thought away! Morrison's music today is fresh and alive. His reflections on career, spirituality, and home is refreshing. It is dissapointing to hear music fans regard Van Morrison as a 70s artist, it truely shows that they have not listened to Van Morrison lately."
3,Van is still the man,"Back On Top is a good album but it does need alitte help.Track 2 will grow to be a classic for Van I believe,I love that one.If you are not a real big fan of Van Morrison I dont think this one is for you.Go try a classic like Moondance or a greatest hits album.But still its Van you cant go wrong."
4,"Ho, hum, another terrific Van Morrison album.","It was a lot less expensive being a Van-fan back in the 70's and 80's when he would put out an album every 2-3 years. All us fans should be very grateful that he has become some much more prolific (or maybe just more confident if you've listened to The Philosipher's Stone you know how much good stuff never made it out). Well this is another excellent effort. Van is, and always has been Van, and I for one am very thankful for that."
5,"Back on Top: Superb collection of songs, inspired.","As with all his music, Van Morrison never disappoints or gives anything less than his very best. Back on Top is as good as his best work. He has drawn from various influences, rock, blues, jazz, and created songs that are original in their scores and lyrics. You can always rely on him for fresh, original and creative music. I have listened to this CD over and over, and I love it more each time. The CD starts off with a good, rollicking rock and roll song, great energy and rhythm, with interesting lyrics. Then it continues with The Philosopher's Stone, one of the most gorgeous songs I have ever heard - pure poetry with a lush, rich orchestal score, it's captivating. The rest of the CD is also magical. Great work, Van!"
4,A fine piece of work,This effort is better than Van's last couple of albums in the fact it's mixed better and it doesn't sound like he is trying too hard to make a classic.
5,I LOVE this...,"I finally got around to buying this dvd a few weeks ago.. and every video on it is great! I have watched it several times. In my opionon, Placebo is one of the best bands out today... and this captures how unique they are. It includes a long interview with the band members telling stories, and some live footage as well. If your a placebo fan, you must own this."
4,Sweet book!,"""Near Mama's Heart"" is a very sweet book! There are wonderful photos of mothers nursing their little ones, from birth through toddlerhood. There are photos of tandem-nursing, co-sleeping nurslings, acrobatic ""monkey-nursing"", and many more! I love that these are real families, and they have all decided to give their little ones the best start in life! BREAST IS BEST! :)I agree with the previous reviewer... I would LOVE for this book to be available in board-book form... The paperback version will not hold up much longer to my (still nursing) 19-month old's not-so-gentle treatment! Also, then our favorite bookstores could feature this book right there on the shelf next to ""Good Night Moon""!"
1,Dissapointing,"I bought this book expecting useful information on toddlers. The fact that the book is presented as a manual is ""fun"" (ie: some ""models"" instead of ""toddlers""). But nothing beyond....the content is too light. It didn't contribute at all to my basic knowledge on toddlers."
5,"It's a good story, a good love story!","I have one chance to listen to a part of this story,""The Furnished Room"",in my class.Telling the truth,I feel that it is not easy to read because of some recondite words. However, on the other side, with the detailed description and the radio reading, it makes me go through the situation personally. Esepecially the surprised ending, it also touched me much and I shut myself in a world of fancy for a long time. I think that it's a good story, a good love story. As a whole, I like the story very much!"
5,Career defining album for Bruce Hornsby,"With ""Spirit Trail,"" Hornsby has put together a superb collection of songs that define his unique piano-based style. With his technique at its finest, with this CD Hornsby has reached the pinnacle of his recording projects to date. Each of the two discs is produced by a different producer team (the first by Hornsby himself, the second a collaborative effort with Hornsby). While I prefer the acoustic-based rock of the first CD, the second, which is more electric and somewhat more pop oriented, is still very enjoyable and does not betray Hornsby's style. If you're a Bruce Hornsby affeciado, this CD boxed set is a must --- The Beatles White Album equivalent of his career."
5,"Worth the 3 year wait - this is his best, bar none","I was hoping and anticipating a major breakthrough for Bruce musically in this new CD set, and I wasn't disappointed. An extraordinary musician who just gets better and better through the years. He's exploring many new areas of musical expression, and lucky for us, he's sharing his journey with the world."
5,"The best since ""The Way It Is"".......","This was one of my best buys in a very long time. It is amazing that there is still someone left that writes his own songs and plays his own instruments. This is a perfect balance of diverse piano and vocal stylings. This is, by far, his best CD since ""The Way It Is"". Aside from the songs listed on the cover, ""Fortunate Son"" is one of the best tracks I have ever heard by Bruce or anyone else. By this CD now!!!!"
4,"Bloated, But Still a Great Album","""Spirit Trail"" is a 60-minute masterpiece buried in 90 minutes of music. ""Fortunate Son"" is Bruce's most hauntingly moving ballad since ""Mandolin Rain,"" ""Sunflower Cat"" is irresistably funky, and ""Sad Moon,"" ""Shadow Hand,"" and ""Swan Song"" are just great songs. It's a pleasure to hear some instrumental interludes as well (""Song C,"" etc.). ""Spirit Trail"" is a unique and worthy contribution to American music.However, the album could have been improved tremendously by leaving out a few weak tracks. In particular, ""Preacher in the Ring"" (recorded in two different versions, no less) is both musically uninteresting and lyrically stupid (is Bruce trying to make fun of actual religious fundamentalists, or is this his ""clever"" way of comparing Christian conservatives with snake handlers?).Buy this album, but don't be afraid to skip over a few tracks."
3,Spirit Trail has its highs and lows.,"The most recent of Hornsby's music is an interesting combination of songs that seem to show off his capabilities and other songs that seem to show him taking a backseat to his capabilities. The album seems to be created with a more laid-back Bruce Hornsby. The style and pace seems light years away from ""The Way It Is,"" Bruce Hornsby that we used to know. This album does have its share of brilliant piano playing that only Bruce Hornsby can create. I have collected every album Bruce has made in the past and I will continue to get everything that he makes in the future. I hope that he will one day release a live album. As for this album, When it all stacks up it does more good than bad and I recommend it to any Bruce Hornsby fan."
3,SELENA AT HER BEST,"THIS IS TYPICAL SELENA. ALTHOUGH, WE ENJOY THE CD, I DIDN'T FEEL THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW TO HEAR."
3,Okay for the time being,"I used to listen to this album a lot in the mid 90s when it first came out. Some songs like ""My Night To Howl"" and ""1800 Used To Be"" were fun at the time but now they just sound silly. I literally LOL when I listened to MNTH 16 years later. Lorrie Morgan's a great singer no doubt, but War Paint is a reflection of the country pop era and the steps Nashville was taking to imitate pop (the Madonna like cover, pop-rock flair and overly dramatic musical arrangements). Some songs are more straight ahead or contemporary country like ""If You Came Back From Heaven"" and ""A Good Year For The Roses"". It's a mixed bag and I think that the album lacks consistency because it's trying to be too many things all at once.I don't think that this is a bad album, but it isn't Lorrie's best either. Vocally she's right on as usual and that's why I gave her a 3 star rating because the album's respectable."
5,Fabulous kids CD,This is a really wonderful CD that will appeal to both kids and adults. I'm not quite sure why it's so unknown -- it deserves to be a best-seller. I'd recommend it to everyone and have sent it to lots of other people who all love it too. Give it a try!
3,Older Concert - Not Up To Par With Brutal Planet,"The first few songs almost make Alice appear he can't sing a note. As the concert progresses, the concert does get better, but this VHS tape has nothing on it compared to his most recent work - BRUTAL PLANET! Get the Brutal Planet DVD and leave this one on the shelf."
1,"Great graphics, lousy playability","I was quite excited to buy this after I read the reviews. After I rushed home, installed it and tried out the difficut training missions it still looked pretty good. Then when I actually began a campaign I discovered the fatal flaw of this game - it is boring. You have two choices, you can micromanage the bomber (too complex for anything but gunnery) or you can sit back and watch as the computer plays for you - although you will have to wait long periods of time for anything to happen even if you 'time skip'. My final verdict is that this was a great idea, but poorly executed. The designers were so excited to try to recreate the experience of crewing a B-17 that they forgot to make the game enjoyable. Also, the realism they try to present through the complexity of anything but shooting the guns is mocked by an extremely unrealistic flight model. My next hope is Europa Universalis..."
3,Cool factor wore off after 15 minutes.,"If you like well simulated flight and controls, Do not plan on enjoying this game. This game was obviously aimed at the arcade style gamers and has little to offer real simmer's that spend time with FS2000 or the like. The graphics were great, and the depth of the mission were superb. However, you are funneled into predesigned sets of activities and don't have the control you are used to if you enjoy pure flight simulation. In short...IF YOU'RE A GAMER/FLYER - BUY IT. IF YOU'RE A SIMMER/FLYER - SAVE YOUR MONEY."
2,Frustrated B-17 owner,"This simulator has great potential but the game needs a lot more ram than the published minumum. Infogrames technical support is totally non-existant! Also, number of additional aircraft is severly limited as is what you can do with them. All in all, a very disappointing product."
2,bombers and bugs,"While aspiring to be a challanging and realistic simulator, this program falls short. It has potential but is plagued with programing bugs, lack of program configuration documentation, and technical support. Infogames is relying on a user's forum and having customers share lessons learned and fixes amongst themselves. In my opinion, the game must have been released prior to any beta testing. Two patches have been released and another is on the way."
5,"Il Trovatore, Verdi's greatest opera",This is the recording that turned me onto opera. The cast is thrilling throughout. Definitely worth buying two copies (in case something happens to the first!)
1,not that help,not that help for new immigrant except listen some English conversation without text. The DVD will not play in computer and the phone call get answering machine. There is no help for tech support on its WEB which only list the product.
2,fish tank light,"I purchased this and after 2 months the light bulb went out, so I just want to inform you on your purchase, be ready to buy another light bulb fast."
2,Decent premise that did not pan out,"The premise here was good enough but most of the film suffers from what I call excessive-tracking-shot-itis, which just drags it out and does not add to the story or mood in any way.Weird music and a story that doesn't go much of anywhere.Stars for location and Peter Stormare."
5,Excelent,"Nice product, nice shopping with this guys, ships really fast, i'm really satisfied with everything and I recommend this guys."
4,Two great classics,"The title is a little misleading, since it hints at creaky old victorian tales about spectres haunting the houses where they died. Anyone stumbling blindly into this volume will therefore be shocked by ""The Willows"" and ""The Wendigo"", two of the best horror stories ever written. Most people today don't find the idea of ghosts terribly scary because they are so easy to understand (spirits of the dead). ""The Willows"" is frightening because the forces involved are almost impossible to understand! And ""The Wendigo"" will scare you away from wintry forest landscapes (and probably most of Canada) for a good long while!"
5,Very good Cd,The singer is a good friend of my dad from when they were little kids. It was nice to hear all this songs. The CD does not disappoint.
2,"For fans of the band, not fans of music","The Flaming Lips live performances are impressive, but it does not translate in this very raw and roughly edited DVD. It is hard to translate the energy of a live performance to a video being watched from a couch, and if you are not reliving your own live Flaming Lips experience, it will disappoint any music enthusiast. The actual singing and playing are average, and it seems the schtick of a space craft at a zoo overshadows real music and entertainment content. The footage and editing have been done much better in other Flaming Lips DVDs as well. If you aren't buying it to relive a previous Lips concert you attended, it will fall flat."
1,This is is one of the worst cd's i have ever bought!!,"i always love to check out the reviews made by the listeners themselves, so when i saw that practically 99.9% of the people who wrote their reviews thought this cd was just the best ever.i remember how anxious i was to get this cd, really thinking that this is the next big thing.boy was i wrong.sure krystal has some amazing vocal talent, but come on,how many times do you hear a voice like that, it's not like krystal actually takes her vocal talent and does much with it, except the very expectant vocal tricks.and the songs are just terrible.they were practically dripping with the typical sugarcoated manufactured pop sound.the lyrics are very predicatble, and i seriously don't know how religious you have to be to enjoy music like this.what i look for in music is originality,proffesionalism,soul, and talent combined with that, and krystal failed to combine all these qualities into a somewhat decent album.with work like this, she will not go far."
5,I love what she stands for and what a voice!,"I took my daughter to see the BSB's in concert and she was the opener. I never enjoyed my self so much at a concert. I was so sad to see her exit the stage. I couldn't wait to buy her CD and after listening to it at least a thousand times, I still discover I like it more and more. Every song is great but my two favorite songs would have to be My relgion and When you hurt. I bought two CD's and plan on getting a few more for friends and their children. She is someone you can be happy your children are listening to... I hope she makes it big. We need more like her."
4,finally,"Finally an average looking girl who can sing and play an instrument at the same time! krystal has such an angelic voice, I love it. The songs are diverse and I think everyone can find something in this cd that they like. Buy it, it isn't like the other stuff that is out there right now."
5,Can't go wrong with Veggie Tales!,"My kids (ages 2, 4 and 5) love Veggie Tales. If you're looking for G rated movies for young kids that teach great lessons, try any of the Veggie Tale videos."
3,Kids love it. Me...not so much.,"My daughter is into princesses, so she loves the stories on this video. Personally, I found the songs less inspired than usual. The main song in the Sweet Pea story quickly began to irritate me, in fact. The tune, the irregular rhymes and rhythm...gah! Where is the simple song stuff? Don't make it complicated, like some weird early '90s love croon.Then there's the editing. Seriously, guys, how can you put out a product this disorganized? In the Sweet Pea story, the queen's curse gives her blemishes, but in one shot right after she gets them, they're conspicuously missing. Later, the queen's crown gets stolen, yet in several different shots of her during that part of the story, she has it on her head again. It was so obvious that my eight year old noticed the problem. Fail.Seriously, if this wasn't my daughter's favorite VT video of all time, I'd chuck it. It really feels like they just phoned this one in."
4,Great Workout,"I get a great workout from this rower. I especially like the individual arms. With the pulley system rowers you can't tell if both sides of your body are working out to their potential. I also like that the movement simulates actual rowing. This is a very good machine, and fine quality for the price. I would definately recommend it. I do not have trouble keeping my feet in the braces, I wear a woman's size 11 shoe, and I wear my old running shoes which have a pretty sizeable heal on them.This was super easy to put together!I have now had this rower for almost 2 years. It is still in fine working condition. I did let someone try the rower who was over the 275 lb. weight limit, the underside of the seat cracked. I replaced the thin board underneath the seat with a thicker piece of wood and there was no other damage done to the rower then or since.This is still a very effective piece of equipment for exercise."
5,Must Have for Family History Research!,"This book is an essential piece to family history research. In it you will find county boundaries for various years, which helps you know which county to search in the census records. I discovered that the county my family was from didn't exist in earlier years. The book helped me identify the county that pre-existed the one we see on maps today. Highly recommended!"
4,Cool product,"I love all but one thing about this Sound Spa...the display is way too bright even on the ""dim"" setting. I sleep with a washcloth over it! Not very handy for checking on the time when you wake up in the middle of the night!The sounds are great & you can listen to them all night or set a timer to shut them up."
1,:gag:,"zero stars. who actually listens to this crap? frickin' A make good charlotte look like the modern saviors of rock music. no substance, no meaning, no nothing. this is ""music"" at it's absolute worst. I'd almost recommend a britney spears record before this one, only because BS is more memorable. please do yourself a favor and skip over this terrible excuse for a musical act."
3,Not a very Merry Fraggle Holiday,"I really loved the Fraggles from childhood, and I was trying to get in the Christmas spirit, but the DVD after the first episode did not really help me get there. The first one is very cool, and talks about the Winter Solstice and how different people around the world celebrate the holidays, but the other two episodes seem to just be filler!However, my little cousins loved the games that are under the Bonus Features, and seeing an episode of the animated version on the DVD is also cool...so I can't be too hard on it. Just be advised...the DVD is not ALL about the holidays"
3,"BOLD, BUT DISAPPOINTING","Although the concept behind Timecode is highly unusual and creative, the technique of showing four different scenes at one time by dividing the screen into four windows is distracting. Three windows will continue their action silently while the viewer is privy to the soundtrack to one of the four windows. And the soundtrack changes to different windows throughout the film, so you are never quite sure what is happening and where. Eventually you piece together the whole story and easily see the interconnectedness of the four screens, but it is, like I said, a distracting technique. However, I applaud whatever person attempted this concept because it is groundbreaking and different and strives to be something more than what we are used to. Interestingly, you would think that the character development would suffer immensely from this kind of format, but oddly, you can tell a lot about each of the characters by their actions with and without the soundtracks."
3,"brilliant execution, lame story","Timecode is quite simply a well-executed but failed experiment.The concept is brilliant, but it is not supported at all by a good plot. What we have is basically mindless hipster dross; jet-set stereotypes stabbing each other in the back with their cell phones, and not much else. And yet, I was entertained by the film on a technical level. Certainly worth a look, but I would love to see this idea done again, even by Figgis, with a more engrossing story."
2,Blah,"When I rented this, I was under the impression it was a good movie. Well, I was wrong. True, the four-screen idea is innovative and couldn't have been easy to do, so I'll give Mike Figgis credit for that. In addition, the movie was shot in continuous takes, so the actors involved have proved that they have the chops to pull off something like this. And in case you're wondering if you can follow four stories at once, the volume is usually muted for three of the screens, so it's obvious which one you're really supposed to focus on at any given time. On the minus side, any time actors are given the chance to improvise their dialogue, the viewer learns anew that we really do need screenwriters, and this movie is no exception. Most importantly, this movie doesn't have ANY interestng stories or characters. Movies need those things! So, if you're interested in the techniques Figgis used, by all means check this out. But don't expect to be entertained."
2,Dissapointing Novel,"Interesting topic. Fantastic setting, but the author didn't seem to do anything with the picture she painted. I picked up the book while living abroad in Mexico and had just finished a trip to the high desert country where this novel takes place. While Anita Desai painted the picture of where I was, I lacked the convincing plot and story to the novel to keep me entertained. I finished the novel, but not because it was a page-turner."
5,Awesome CD!!,I wonder where she went? She has a great voice and listening to this CD brings back tons of memories of days gone by. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to female country artists with beautiful voices!
5,Great Album,This is a great country album. Mindy has so much emotion in her lyrics and vocals. Her voice is very unique as well. No one else really sounds like her.
3,music fan,I do not know if this is the same Jailhouse from the late 80's that had a few ex-Rough Cutt members. From what I could here the album is not bad. Not heavy but melodic. A nice change if you ever get tired of the 90's music.
4,A must-read for Southerners and wannabe Rebs,"Grissom truly captures the essence that is the South. If there was ever a book that comes close to the task of distilling the difference between the South and the rest of the nation, it's this one. READ IT!"
2,"Mississippi String Bands, Vol Two","This CD was issued by County Records, Roanoke VA in 1998. It reminds me of Saturday nights during my youth when we would gather at a neighbor's home and listen to locals play tunes like those on this CD on the fiddle, guitar and haromnica. However, the quality of the recording on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 & 17 is the reason for my two-star rating. These tracks give out a very annoying hum that seriously alters the listening quality. Music on the other tracks, while delightful in itself to those of us with a heritage in in early Mississippi music, was statisfactory and about as good as could be expected in view of the fact that it was originally recorded in the 1920s & 30s. Other than the annoying hum, I thoroughly enjoy the CD but the hum is a serious defect."
4,good buy,"This was a good screen at a great price. I had it shipped to Afghanistan and it had a broken end, but still worked."
5,Very pleased,"I was a little hesitant due to the low price and some of the reviews. I can tell anyone interested that this screen is great. It is very smooth, easy to lower and raise and the metal casing is very durable. It doesn't bow and you can't beat the price. It is heavy so be prepared to mount properly to your wall. Highly recommend."
3,Damaged in shipping - Third time's a charm,"This is an extremely affordable screen, 1:1 aspect ratio, 70x70 inches viewable area. It does not have a reflective coating that increases brightness by narrowing the viewing angle. That feature costs more anyway, and this is an entry-level screen. Construction is cheap but good quality. However I returned two of them over the course of a month before I got one that survived shipping. These are really not packaged to survive UPS. Between bending in the middle and smashed ends(ruining the windup mechanism), you'll need to be persistent and patient. The third one worked and had only minor dents so I kept it. Think positively."
3,Mixed Review,"I have had this screen for almost 3 years now. The clarity and brilliance of display on this screen is truly amazing. However, after less than 6 months of use the retracting mechanism started to act up. The warranty through Elite would cover any needed repairs, however, since you have to pay for shipping and handling too and from them, it would be cheaper to buy a new screen than to actually use the ""warranty"". After 3 years of fighting more and more to keep the mechanism working, I am now looking at powered screens for a permanent solution."
1,Don't waste your money,"This screen is okay quality. It was pretty much what I expected for the price. The reason I gave it such a low rating though, was because as soon as we mounted it & pulled the screen all the way out, we could not get it to retract back. It eventually does retract, but it takes so many times of tugging on it. Its ridiculous and so annoying!It never worked from the very beginning. I definately wish I wouldve spent the extra to go with a nicer one!...Don't waste your money"
1,Broken on Delivery,"Elite Screens sell at a very good price, which sold me on this one. Well, I got what I paid for and it came broken with the center rod (on which all the winding is done) was disengaged and unusable. This was the second Elite Screen I have had which had this problem, and after doing more checking I found it is a common problem.I recommend considering other companies at this low cost end of the screen market."
5,Great picture.,"Very low cost and good quality screen. The retracting mechanism works very well and feels solid. I am using this with a 1080p projector and color, brightness and resolution are very good. In my opinion, this screen gives as good or better a picture than screens costing many times more."
2,Cheap,Screen looked pretty good when I took it out of the box. The second time I pulled the screen it broke and now it won't roll up.
4,Excellent screen,"This is a very good screen for the price. It is easy to manipulate and the installation is easy. The box arrived slightly damaged (FedEx again) but I did not have the courage to return the unit and was able to mount it this way.This is a relatively wide screen (110 inches between the mounting brackets) and it has a tendency to bend a bit due to its weight. Things get better when it is unrolled.IMHO, it is a much better deal than a motorized screen, much cheaper for the same exact screen. The black contour allows for a sharper image cut with the videoprojector."
1,cheap but ok in some rooms,"Let me start by saying you can't beat this price wise. Once you get past that you get what you pay for. This is great for power points in a confrence room but for movies or HT it does not cut it well for a better projector Colors are not quite accurate off this screen, if you use a 1080p image the screen materal is ruff enought that it is bigger than the pixles there for you will never get full resulation. Amyhow I can go on and on about all the bad thing but it is cheap and will work in a pinch or for a cheaper projector for the kids."
5,Looks Great,"I ordered this on Friday and received this on Thursday. When I received this, I didn't realize how big it actually going to be. I know 106"" is big, but I didn't expect it to be as large as it was.The installion was very simple. I ended up not needing any hardware besides the 2 dry wall anchors that I already had in my toolbox. I mounted this with the keyholes on the back so it is against the wall. The installation was simple and fast.I just wish I could say the same thing about getting my projector mounted"
1,Damaged,"The screen is awesome, the dent it came with is not. This thing is so massive (which i like), i imagine its hard to transport it without getting damaged. My money I used to pay for this product was not damaged, so the product purchased should not be damaged either."
3,It's okay,"Good book, great transaction but I was looking for a book with stories using L.A's lessons from the story."
5,West redefines the jazz standard Idiom w/ talent,"Paula West an emerging jazz singer has hit the mark with her new CD RESTLESS. The 15 songs chosen are a mixture of ballads and sultry new and rarely performed standards that highlight her smoky assured tone. Backed by 10 musicians, such standouts are Who Will Buy - sung as an anthem of hope and euphoria, Waters of March- the Jobim chestnut - never performed better than by West, Some Cats Know- a sly Leiber & Stoller tune that West purrs all over it Lover and Witchcraft- two often done gems that swing with controlled abandon and expertise under Ms. West's tenure, and a Hoagy Charmichael tune- Bread & Gravy- introduced by Ethel Waters. West sings it in homage to Waters but brings us in to the new age with her assurance. A fine listen from an artist who is one of the finest at her craft!"
4,Wisegal,It was well written and showed a struggling mother doing what she had to do for her family. Good acting too.
2,Natural Nutrition for Dogs and Vats,"A friend explained this book to me and the way of nutrition worked for her, so i thought I would get the book and try it for my Pom who was 10 years old. Unfortunately he was too old for this method of raw food. He died shortly afterwards. But if I had a new puppy I would use the raw food method that the book explains. Too bad, but I hope this helps someone out there."
3,A decent place to start,"If you're new to raw food for your cat or dog, this guide will give you a good introduction to the idea. It's not the most comprehensive or well-researched text on the topic, but it will certainly open your eyes to what you *shouldn't* be feeding your pet, and steer you in some good, alternate directions. Worth a look."
2,Not enough hands on information.,"The book was not what I expected. A lot of redundant information on nutrients and bioavailability, a lot of lists, and a whole appendix on references and resources. The list of three diets by weight, a ten pound, fifty pound, and a hundred pound animal was not very useful. My dog is seventy pounds. I was looking for something much more basic in the how to and where to get it. I wanted to know more about chicken necks and turkey necks and not the vitamin or nutrient components of them. The large number of antidotal stores running for many pages may have been interesting if your pet had that specific problem but they are not definitive as to cause and effect or anything else. I wasted my money."
5,Buying Again - Can't live without it!,"My kids love this, and as an adult who has to sit through it, the banter and dry humor between A and Z is hilarious. They dropped and scratched it when it fell out of the car on a family trip and I'm buying it again for my youngest who misses it so much. The kids didn't seem to mind the less overwhelming presence of Elmo and really appreciate the great music. It's a nice break from Elmo and I was surprised that they picked up on the great underlying lesson about not boasting (A), and not not always being the most popular (Z)."
1,Horrible,"Too much talking, boring actors, not something that holds children's interest. I should have never bought this."
1,Not a good buy for little ones.,"I have a 16 month old and a 6 year old. At the beginning of the DVD it is quite boring and the kids have no interest at all. The letter A starts with Elmo singing a song and the kids are interested again. I guess because it says ""All Star"" in the title, I assumed it would have more actors/Sesame Street characters in it. The Special ""All Star"" guests were only on 6 of the letters (Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge, Norah Jones, Larry King, Martie Maguire, Natalie Pasdar and Emily Robinson- I don't know who the last 3 even are). The Sesame Street Characters were on about 5 of the letters and some with hte actors. My kids had no interest and both love watching Sesame Street videos all the time. My 16 month old loves watching the ""Sing Yourself Silly"" DVD over and over. I think this DVD was thrown together and didn't have much thought put into it at all. I know I wish I could return it at this point because it was a waste of money. Nobody wants to watch it."
2,not really good,"i bought this for my two year old baby, but she gets bored with it maybe because she is not familiar with the songs and people here like norah jones or any other artists so she doesn't like this and its hard for her to watch movie like this with lots of adult artists singing their popular songs and yet those songs obviously are not popular for the kids..."
3,A great Texas rock n' roll band...,"I saw them near San Fransisco at the Shoreline Ampitheater several years back. They were great. The drummer rocked hard- she layed down the groove and generally played superbly- a real talent. The bass player looked like Dusty Hill of ZZTop and played as good as him. The guitar player, who looked like Keith Richards' younger brother, was very tastefull and played for the song. Yet another talent. Carolyn is like a combination of Janis Joplin and Bonnie Raitt. Four genuinely talented youngsters. If you like the Stones, Joplin, Raitt, Black Crowes, amonst others, you'll enjoy this one."
4,It's a nice toy,"I bought this toy for my 20 month-old daughter, she doesn't seem to be interested in it, but I personally like it becasue it is soft to cuddle and I think it might be a little bit difficult for her age to do anything with it yet. I'll put it away for now and will bring it back for her to play with when she gets a little bit older, maybe 6 months later and see."
1,useless,"Maps were useless. Lonely Planet always denotes suggestions on map. This book mentions a subway stop for your DETAILED directions. That is it. You are on your own from there. Sometimes there is no map, no address, and not even a phone - i.e. Megero Parasite Museum in Tokyo.I personally would suggest that a Paris map would be more helpful in Tokyo than the maps in this book. At least the Paris map would not falsely lead you into believing that any effort was spent on making it helpful for you to get around Tokyo.I assure you, the people of Japan will thank you for not buying this book, and asking their assistance every time your foolish enough to open it and try to follow the cryptic directions to a suggested site."
4,"Good value, good performance","These brake pads were easy to fit and with the scorched surface only required minimal if any break-in.They perform as expected and come with shims to make sure they are quiet.I have been on these for over a month with no issues. The brake pad surface looks to have quite a bit more metallic flake than others, but I dont know if this really makes a difference in everyday use. I installed these on the rear and have not seen any increase in brake dust or noise, overall a good pick"
1,KINDLE EDITION - Do not buy,"I bought the KINDLE EDITION of this book on sale at $2.99, which is not cheap enough for me to keep it.There are a lot of missing figures, and the mathematical formatting is heartbreaking. The footnotes are placed in aberrant locations, sometimes 10 pages later. There's not one single link in the book - it's a block of text. Forget a ToC or a ToF, there is none. It reads and looks like a bad joke.Do not buy the Kindle version. If you do, ask for a refund. Maybe the editor will put some effort into it instead of just scanning a paperback and converting to AZW."
3,a hodge podge pictorial,"There is nothing 'radical' about any of the projects here. Nice they are, I'll give you that. But only nice. Nothing a professional in the field could not come up with. The picture quality is less than tops, and there are even teeny-weeny unreadable B&W photos that are attached to supposedly famous names. It kind of gives you the impression that the author was either running out of material to fill the book with or had too many friends who wanted a piece of the action.If the only thing in common that is supposed to hold all the projects under one roof is that they are all 'radical', well, the author ought to choose another word, even if a more etymological meaning was intended by it (Radix, Latin, root).I bought it at full retail price and feel I've been jipped, but at half the price, I suppose it's worth having...It's a CATALOGUE, basically."
3,Review for EDL 501,"This book was required for a graduate course through Nova University. I used this book along with the information from the instructor's weekly lectures to complete assignments. Curriculum Improvement Decision Making and Process provided a historical foundation that was enlightening to me. As a classroom teacher I talk about and use the word curriculum on a daily basis. However, a sense of meaning developed after having read some background on the struggles and the efforts people have undertaken throughout the years to make the necessary curriculum changes to improve the nation's schools and to enhance the learning process for our children."
5,Curriculum Design at Its BEST!!!!!,"Curriculum Improvement: Decision Making and Process provides a thorough backgrond in the establishment of curriculum design. The text examines numerous aspects of curriculum design, such as political influences, cultural influences, selection of subject matter, the planning process, and numerous other areas of curriculum design. I believe all curriculum designers should consult Doll's text when contemplating the design of a school district's curriculum. It is that GOOD!!!!"
1,A Difficult Read,"While this text provided curriculum information in great depth and breadth, I found the format overwhelming at times. I think this book presented too many details and too much information in each chapter. The situations are thought-provoking and helpful."
3,Doll Review,"The textbook entitled ""Curriculum Improvement by Doll begins with an overview of the historical and philosophical foundations of curriculum. The book then focuses on the social and cultural issues affecting curriculum decision-making. Chapter four addresses subject matter selection for curriculum matter, while the fifth chapter discusses how decisions made by teachers directly affect the ways in which curriculums are designed. Part two of the book focuses on process. Chapter eight provides a comprehensive look at curriculum planning. The last few chapters in the book consider individual roles played by educators and their roles in the design and improvement of today's curriculum. Communication issues and leadership roles are also addressed."
2,Curriculum Improvement?,I did not find Doll's book on Curriculum Improvement to be very helpful. It did providesome insight to the steps we should follow when developing a curriculum and provided someexamples of the way some school districts align their curriculum.
5,Curriculum Improvement: 9th ed/ Doll,"The text is well organized and includes a comprehensive preface and prologue to give the reader an overview of the content. The text is organized in two parts which made it very easy to follow. At the end of each chapter, there is a summary review which provides the major objectives at a glance and gives the reader a chance to verify the major components presented in that chapter. There were several activities in each chapter to assure the reader is understanding the material. The text presented recent useful information to apply to my current workplace."
3,Curriculum Planning,"Curriculum Improvement,Decision Making and Process by Ronald C.Doll, is a helpful tool for new and veteran teachers to expand their knowledge base. The book is full of detailed information, and will hopefully help educators to make much needed changes to the educational system."
4,Curriculum and Improvement,"Curriculum and Improvement Decision Making and Process Ronald C. CobbI found this book to be very useful. While in my Master's program, I used this book extensively. It breaks the curriculum process into small units of information that anyone in the education field can relate with. This book takes each individual aspect of designing curriculums and explains how to create or improve an existing one. Also, this text provided numerous activities that aid the teacher or designer. I had limited knowledge of designing curriculums before I used this book. After using and applying the concepts from this book, I have found that I understand the process of designing a curriculum as well as implementing improvements on an existing one.Those individuals who are in the education field would find this book invaluable. Whether you are a teacher or an administrator, this book will give you the proper guidelines to designing and improving curriculums."
4,An Easy-Reading Text,"The book Curriculum Improvement by Ronald C. Doll was one of the easiest reading textbooks I've had for a university course. Doll writes in an easy-going style that sounds as if he's explaining it to you in person. The opening chapter alone was worth the price of the book. It contained a condensed look at all of the philosophical schools of thought, including Idealists, Realists, Pragmatists, etc. Doll's book also describes the fundamentals involved with the curriculum development process. The chapters on curriculum change and improvement cover the attitudes involved, problems that emerge in the ongoing process, and who the participants in the process should be."
3,Review of Curriculum Improvement,"Doll presents the information in a way that helps the reader understand and become familiar with how important matters of curriculum are to the management and cohesive structure of a school. The text is not repetitious or boring. In the writers experience, most text books are dry, repetitous, and require multiple read throughs in order to establish a good understanding of what is being read. Doll combines knowledge and examples to help the reader understand how a great curriculum can enhance the quality of education, administrators, and students in a school."
1,Nice bowls but lousy packaging and arrived all cracked!,"I was completely shocked and my fingers are cut when I try to open the parcel. The bowls are all crushed and to my surprise, there was only 2 bowls instead of the 3 bowls that are stated, I really wonder is it because of the ""missing"" bowl, that's why the packaging box could not hold the item in place and therefore it was damaged during the shipping process.I had placed orders for other items from Corelle, so far this is the only item that is damaged during shipping."
3,Could have been designed better,This product is useful. Its blocks more sun than an inexpensive one from the local store. However in Texas sun this is not enough. Also I wish someone would design a roller shade for all car models. The one you can stick on one side of the windshield and roll to the other side.This sun blocker is so bulky that it keeps getting moved around from one row to another in the back.An ultimately its sitting in my laundry room cause it occupies too much room in the car.
2,NOT PACKABLE,"Will this GIGANTIC shade keep your Odyssey cool-YES. Will you be able to pack it into packable size to store it in your vehicle-Absolutely NOT! It rolls up into a 6"" Diameter tube that is 4 feet long! If you are planning on storing your vehicle like a motor home this is your shade. If this is your family vehicle-forget it. And please don't take your passenger's head off while trying to wrangle it down from the dash(I almost did)."
4,Cool Toy,"I like Shark Attack because of the harpoon. I also liked the huge spear on the main deck. I also like how the shark can rip the ship in half.Detlef Nelson, Age 11, Seattle, Washington"
5,Great Product!,"Bought this to use on a 12 hour car trip and it worked perfectly. The cord is about 5 feet long which is a good length. Had no trouble with it falling out of the psp like some others have commented on. Overall, you cant go wrong buying this product."
3,"Super Heavy and Strong, but not true 10x15","This is VERY heavy, nothing like bakers secret or whatever it is I bought at walmart. But I hadn't realized from the picture that it isn't straight along the edge, which, if you're actually making a jelly roll, or cinnamon rolls, or the like, you probably want it straight. It is about 9 1/2 inches across at the ends and 10 1/4 or more in the middle. Also, it suggests you cook 25 degrees less, which I hadn't realized it fell in the ""dark coated"" pan category. and for metal utensils, it's not supposed to be a knife and is not warranted if you use a knife. OH, and I thought I'd love the larger lip but I bought 2 of these to fit side-by-side on one rack and they don't because of the lip. They don't even fit straight into my oven, I have to put them sideways like my 18x13 I was buying 2 of these to replace."
1,It's off the hook,808 is DEFENENTLY OFF THE HOOK. THE GROUP BLAQUE HAVE VERY BEAUTIFUL VOICES. THEY CAN SING. Thier suits in the video was the bomb.
5,Boom Baby! You doggoin' set it off,I'm a big music fan and I know good music. Blaque is definetly rockin' the charts. 808 is one of my favorite summer songs already. For those don't know what an 808 is it's a machine that makes bass sounds in songs.
5,The best funk album of all time!,"In the summer of 1976 I was a 14yr-old white boy and I would walk down to the local public school playground for the summer crafts and games - on Fridays they would have a ""dance"" in one of the bungalows - kids would bring their 45's and we'd play them on a portable record player and dance all afternoon...Someone brought ""Tear the Roof Off the Sucker"" one day - I freaked out on it and from that day on I was a music freak.You must hear this album if you like groovy bass and rythms and the electronic keyboards are so way out...""There's a whole lotta rythm goin round!"""
5,CLINTON CHANGED POPULAR MUSIC FOREVER!!,"With the recording of the MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION,George Clinton and crew truly revoulutionized the way people listened to music.This IS funk on a grand scale.What a concept.Black aliens from another planet with only one main objective in mind.To as George would put it`rescue dance music from the blahs'.The title cut P-FUNK(MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION)lets you know right away that this ain`t no disco.Disco NEVER reached the level of creativity,musicianship,vocal prowress,and scatalogical wordplay that Parliament achieved.The overall effect of this music is so profound that it really could have been devised by extra-terrestrials.In other words,no one on earth has or ever will approach the grandeur of this genre.Listen to it from start to finish to truly EXPERIENCE the funky space opera that is the MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION!!!!"
4,My recomendation if you read only one book this year.,"This book is one I hated finishing...it was wonderful. I read it in Italian but intend to purchase a copy in English, in case I missed any of Anne Tyler's subtlety!"
4,A Heartwrenching Love Story,"""The Snow Goose"" is not a very long story, but it is enough to tug at your heart. A love story like no other, ""The Snow Goose"" keeps your interest, and moves very quickly. If you read carefully and let your imagination flow out of the windows of your mind, then you will notice that many things in this story represent something. Paul Gallico has written this story in a very beautiful, poetic way, using the English language to paint exquisite, colorful pictures of nature and animals in your mind. You can just see the marsh and feel the wind blowing around the old lighthouse as night approaches. This story has a tragic ending, leaving your heart and mind in a state of sadness and loneliness, making you only want more from Paul Gallico! Enjoy letting your mind roam with this beautiful little book."
2,To small,The map was to small for my purpose but it is a good map to carry when in DC. I wanted a wall map to research real estate purches. This is a good by for vistors.
5,fold and go,easy to see and get myself oriented. Shows everything I need and also has enlargement of the popular tourist areas. The best part is it folds itself and doesn't tear like a paper map. I've used the Streetwise maps in other capitol cities with great success and envy from fellow travelers.
3,not my cup of tea,"we used this book in my formal logic course; my professor absolutely loved this book and insisted that there exists no better text for studying formal logic...I beg to differ. well, while I have yet to find a great easy to understand text, I certainly didn't like this book. It's very short and concise..very brief. Personally, I prefer the lessons to be a bit more elaborate, with a variety of examples. I think it really depends on your taste and style of learning; this book would definitely appeal to some people, who like this short and to the point...but not for me. I prefer ""the logic book"" to this text."
2,No fish yet on these!,"I don't know..But so far, I haven't got any fish on these.Only time will tell if there are any catfish who eat these."
5,Every Song is great,My kids love this. Its quite entertaining for the adults too. All songs are easy to follow and easy for kids to sing along.
5,A really enjoyable CD for all ages,"I'm ordering my 2nd - 5th copies of this CD today. The songs are wonderful, and Mr. Lithgow has the perfect voice (and enthusiasm) to perform them. The songs are very happy and catchy without being too sickly sweet. My son and I are always singing the songs around the house. My husband will catch up to us when we play it on car trips this summer, but for now he thinks we're a little crazy! My mother, a Danny Kaye fan, was excited to hear ""The Twins Song"" again. My favorite is ""Everybody Eats when they Come to My House"" and the ""Codfish Ball"" (watch out Shirley Temple). I'm giving this CD as a little Easter gift to my son's godparents. My son is giving a copy to his second grade teacher for Teacher Appreciation Week at school this May. This CD makes a great gift."
5,Just wonderful,"Danny Kaye was the object of my first crush and I never got over him. John Lithgow does such a wonderful job with these songs, they are a real tribute, and soooo much fun. Top quality."
2,Don't believe the photo,"The picture of the two sippy cups does not match what you get. It made ordering confusing, as the pictured cups are 12 oz., not the 7 oz. that you are ordering. In general it's a good product, the lids don't leak at all, the 7 oz. cups aren't shaped as well for gripping either."
5,Best Sippies on planet,"My twin boys are terrors. They can not destroy these or cause them to leak. We love these sippies! My only wish is that there was a metal and silicon version. We hate plastic, but the metal ones available are not as functional as these."
4,Entertaining,I simply loved this movie. It's funny and makes you cheer on the underdog. It was great that females were the top dog in this movie. I can't wait till it's on DVD.
4,Great Movie,This is a great movie. I'm waiting for it to come out on DVD. I have always loved watching it. Good action and it's funny!!
4,feds,I liked this movie it just cracked me up. It shows that no matter what you want in life you can get it if you really try hard enough.
1,No videos on demand.,"I removed this DVD from my want list because I noticed this: ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply"". Blech, I'm not interested in on demand DVDs."
4,It rocks,"I can't say this is my favorite album ever, but sometimes I like firing this up while I do other things as it is great background music. In my opinion some of the songs are a bit repetitive but that goes along with the genre, and I am not blown away by any of the guitar work, but they are catchy-themed songs. Good to have on while you are doing something mildly distracting, but not the type of album you can put on and purely focus on"
5,Absolutely Fabuloso,"Can this thing only give 5 stars? Ok, so maybe you won't believe me because I sound like a raving freak of a fan. I'll tone it down a bit and give you the facts. Cadallaca is Corin Tucker (of Sleater-Kinney), Sarah Dougher and STS (both of the Lookers). I would say that Cadallaca is a pretty even blend of the Lookers' pop sensibilities and S-K's rock-o-rama. And with Sarah and Corin penning the songs, you just can't go wrong. I'm really at a loss for words. Trust me and buy the damn thing."
3,1I found it helpful,I found the book helpful. I am writing a book and I needed help on how to find copyright owners.
3,Good Basic Info But Non-Specific,"I probably had the wrong expectations for this book but I was hoping it would (quickly) help me validate whether info I've used required permission. I suppose it did this in an indirect way, however, the free use stuff included old songs etc. that were not appropriate for my topic.Book is well written so long as it fits with what you need to validate."
4,A Useful Resource,"This is really a volume that is not designed to be read through, but to be referred to. Taken as such, it is a valuable resource for any number of fields, particularly in regards to visual or intellectual property.Unfortunately, the one area in which is falls short is the one in which I would find most useful, and that is recorded music. In truth, this is not the fault of the book - it is because the vast majority of recorded music does not fall under the category of Public Domain yet, and won't for awhile. Regardless, there is some useful information about using printed and scored music.This would be most useful on the shelf of any type of self-publisher. A quick check thumbing through its pages may save you some grief later. A caveat, though - I am no lawyer, and I can't make any strong claims as to the validity of the book's claims. Still, it seems like a good place to start."
4,How to Find?,"The text covers copyright law for a large set of materials: writings, music, art, photography, film and television, computer software, architecture, maps, choreography, compilations, and titles. The book does not provide much help in how to find public domain materials; it only explains how to confirm that a copyright has expired for a particular item."
4,Very interesting book with many good ideas and much information.,As a copyright holder myself I was sufficiently interested to request this book. I can only speak to the authenticity of the section (MUSIC) which I have specific knowledge and I didn't find any errors jump out at me. I would assume the rest of this rather large volume is equally accurate and If one is involved in any of these arts I would recommend this purchase. The value to the general consumer looking for some FREE goodies isn't as juicy as it seems ...the bulk of public domain material is silent movie level for film and pre-blues folk song level for music...buried treasure to be sure.
2,Don't buy this if you have the new iPod,"I bought this iPod case at a retail store, found it sitting on the shelf next to the new iPod I bought at the same time. One would think that a retailer would sell the new case for the new iPod, but no. The result is that this case doesn't fit the buttons for the new form factor on the latest iPod. While it is probably a good case for the original models, it doesn't meet the needs of the new iPod. Stay away from this case if you have the new iPods."
4,It is not that bad....,"Saw this movie on HBO yesterday, I will have to say the cinematography was a bit strange...but this film kept me guessing what was going to happen next...high action, and almost from the moment that it started!! I little vulgar, but hey I would be too if I knew there was a madman with a rifle looking to kill me...and I had no idea where he was. The ending is a major surprised...overall I liked this film!"
5,a great movie,This film reminded me of a 50's movie in some ways. I think alot of that feeling was the caller's voice. (Keifer Sutherland)There were no special effects. The intensity and clastrophobic feeling was brought about by the excellent acting and the way it was filmed. I loved the way it all took place in the one location. Over all I really enjoyed this...a great movie.
3,The preview was the movie.,"I wasn't to thrilled with this movie. The whole plot was in the previews and there was really nothing more to it. Colin Farrell did a wonderful job with his character and portrayed such powerful emotion throughout the movie but I felt somewhat cheated. Almost like if you saw the preview, you pretty much saw the film. Nothing else really happened except you get to see how the fim ended. That was about it."
4,4 of 5,"It's dialogue between a guy in a phone booth and his potential murderer that holds this movie together. The guy; a publicist who deceives people for a living; has a wife and a secret girlfriend whose lives are also on the line. At-least that's what the guy on the line tells him. He also says that if he leaves the booth, he'll shoot him from one of the windows in one of the buildings hovering above. To show he's really there, he takes a shot at a toy robot just outside the booth.It's a clever and captivating concept, and the plot, which seems to run in real time, sticks with it all the way to the end. Almost every scene takes place at the phone booth with a frequent array of shaky zoom shots and split screening for visual stimulation. But the gunman's motive is weak; he claims to be motivated by morality; and he doesn't really demand anything in exchange for his victim's life. So the mind game he plays starts to get a little redundant after a while.marcellee.com"
1,Hmph!,"I am a steadfast, loving, caring, diligent, and proud mother. I selected this movie to allow my 3, 5, and 9 year old children to have a cultural awareness of the hubbub of New york City life. It was but a learning experience, which turned it not something far more.This film is an outrage. Earplugs were neccessary to shelter my babies' ears from the vulgar dialects. Slanderous, primitive, adn vile, this movie fails to meet the standard levels of human decency. I regret showing it to my children, who now know a variety of curse words, but it is not my fault! It's the movies'!HMPH!(ha just kidding. That was just a joke. I'm no mother! Ha ha! I got you real good! No, but seriously, this movie is awful. The cursing was unneccessary and the acting adn story were of failing proportions. Pick another one.)"
2,"Plenty of Star Power, but..................","With names like Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker and Colin Farrell one would think you had a slam dunk for an entertaining film. WRONG!!!!! This film has a slow start and gets less interesting as it goes on. Save your time as this ""thriller"" dissappoints."
4,"Clever, Fast paced semi-comedy","I really enjoyed this film, the sniper had a great personality and I was laughing at just about everything he said. I think the plot was very good, but not as deep as it could have been, but all in all a VERY good movie, I'm gonna go and watch it again. Buy it, you'll enjoy it!"
3,One big confession in a phone booth,"This movie was okay. The thing that made me watch the movie was I really wanted to see how it would end. I found the movie to be nothing but one big confession in a phone booth. You never understand how ""The Caller"" knows what he knows about his ""victims"", but at the same time you can't tear yourself away from the screen. You wonder does the Stuart wish he had not picked up the phone, will he just say to heck with it and leave, can the cops do anything? How is it the caller can get in the head of Stuart the way he does. It's an interesting suspense thriller."
3,88 minutes of beeing in a phone booth..... hmmmmmm,This movie actually had a good plot for most of it involving a guy in a phone booth. i liked this movie alot the first time i saw it i was surprised how good it was but then after the first time its gets old really fast so i recomend u rent this movie dont buy it!!! but anyway stu(colin ferral) is a very greedy sneaky man he cheats on his wife with a lady he knows from work but he always call her in this phone booth outside her apartment but one day the phone starts ringin and u all know how hard it is to not pick up a ringin phonee...... right then he becomes a hostage while the head of police(forest whitaker) struggles to figure out what is happening if stu rele killed sum1 or if the person on the phone is the killer its a thriller very good the first time u watch 3 1/2 stars
1,1 1/2 hour in a phone booth?!,"This movie sucked!! I thought it might be ok, having Kiether Sutherland in it. But I was so wrong. If your a Kiether Sutherland fan, sorry guys all you see is a blurry picture of him at the end."
4,Low-Budget At Its Best,"Phone Booth is a low-budget thriller at its best. The fact that it is clearly low-budget takes nothing away from this stylish thriller (think Reservoir Dogs). Colin Farrel plays Stu Sheppard, a cocky PR man that finds himself stuck in a phone booth with a sniper threatening to kill him if he leaves. Three hookers soon steal the show for the 10 or so minutes that they are in it. The african american hooker makes one of the funniest comments I have ever heard (you'll know what I am talking about). The police arrive, following a shooting that the hookers blame on Stu. Forest Whitaker plays the officer in charge, the man assigned to figure the situation out, and to get Stu out of the booth. An excellent thriller that almost anyone will enjoy. I will definately be purchasing this when it becomes available on DVD."
1,I am confused,"The story starts quite well, draws the viewers' attention but the ending was terrible. I am still trying to figure out why Sutherland has to do this to Farrell, how can he find out so much information about him? Why and how the pizza man was killed? One of the worst ending I have ever seen."
5,hard rock's best release in years!,"the opening guitar crunches to ""old man wise"" sound a new beginning for a new millenium. the self titled lp by union is by far one of the most surprising, most welcomed sounds any fan of good rock music could hope for. yes the band is lead by the dynamic voice of john corabi(breif motley crue voice) and guitar wizard bruce kulick(kiss), and these two misrepresented guys have established themselves as the saviors of rock from an almost embarassing future of sample driven, lack of talent hard rock has become of lately. along with the opening track, the rest of the album moves along with a feverish pitch that kiss wishes they could find again, and motley has slowly been recovering. as an added bonus they included a cover of the beatles ""oh! darling."" which caps an album that has only scratched the surface of a band whose potential has only begun. so get this cd, pop it in, let it rock your ears into a head pounding insanity that has been sorely needed for far to long."
3,"Good game, but outdated...","Don't get me wrong, I love the game system. It's just with the Explorers Edition now out, this book is kind of obselete. All of the rules in this book are now in the new cheaper Explorers Edition, with updates, erratas, and new edges and hinderances.I would only recommend getting this if you have to have all the books."
3,"Hot chicks, poor plot","Dudes, we all know why you would watch this movie (it's not for the meticulous plot, the stunning cinema-photography, or the first-rate acting) it's for the babes (which, this movie delivers). Basically what goes down is this: After Kara (girl from the first Femalien) stays too long on Earth, two other ""extraterrestrials"", Xeda and Trion, are sent to find Kara and bring her back home. Along their journey to hunt Kara down, they observe humans doing what they do best, have relations. Eventually, it's just one giant love-fest. Truly, the only redeeming feature of this movie is the girls, because it's pretty weak in all other areas (even for a movie this type), but it's worth watching, at least once."
1,Don't waste your time,"Femalien is a fun, cheesy, AND sexy romp.... but Femalien 2 seems like it was made with leftovers from Femalien without the sex! The actors and plot are so bad that they are funny, but sadly there is nothing sexy about this flick, at least the VHS version I saw."
1,No good scenes in the whole movie,"This movie doesn't have a single scene worth watching. Femalien 1 is in another league, don't waste your time on the sequel."
2,Worst than the first one,"The first movie has an excellent actress(ypu know what I mean) Venesa Talor.This second has it but only 10 minutes of the film.The best plenty of fless good girls,good bodies and nasty hunks and also the price only ($).Enjoy!"
2,"My Baby is a PERSON, Not a Thing","While this book does contain good information, it's presented in a way I couldn't get past. In an attempt to read like the owner's manual for a machine, like a car or a stereo system, the book consistently refers to the baby as ""the model"". It was obviously meant to be cute but in my opinion it fails in that respect. I'm very much turned off by referring to babies in the same way you would refer to your washing machine. My baby is a PERSON, not a THING. To its credit, the book does explain how each baby is unique, but it does so by pointing out that ""some models do this"" and ""some models do that."" Again, I'm turned off by referring to the baby as a ""model""."
4,Helpful and cute,I bought this as a gift for some friends who were expecting their first child. I thumbed through it before I sent it to them and found it very humorous and had many practical step-by-step instructions for lots of situations. Definetly worth the money!!!
2,Just ok,Lots of reading. I think guys want pictures more. It is funny how they make everything sound like a car manual. Was kind of a waste of money since my husband will never actually read it.
5,"On our third child, and yet this is the best baby book out there...","My wife and I are 6 months into our third child, and we have read several baby books previously. This one has more useful information, and even stuff that no one had told us or was in any of the half dozen books we previously read. It lays out problems and solutions very clearly and makes appropriate jokes, without insulting anyone's intelligence.Let me repeat - I've read a half dozen baby books, and this one STILL had new and useful information, as well as covering all the information that was in the other books.Get this if you have a child, are currently pregnant, or are planning to become pregnant."
3,Shanice,"Shanice's self-titled 4th CD is a good one. The overall tracklist is pretty good. The album contains mostly mid-tempo songs. However, this woman has one of the best voice's the music industry has ever seen! She is very under-rated and deserves more attention. She can sing better than 90-95% of the female singers out today. I think anyone reading this should give her a listen. I love the tracks ""Fly Away"" ""A Reason"" and ""Yesterday"". They are beautiful, and definitely showcase her talent. SHANICE IS OFFICIAL!"
3,She came back pretty hard,"Considering her last effort went un-noticed by the public, this is a far cry better. She has hooked up with a sure fire winner in LaFace Records. The material produced by Babyface is by far the best and she seems most at ease with it. Some of her hip-hop efforts should have been left off the cd as they take away from the R&B feel of the total project and are really out of place. I recommend this cd to those who can appreciate good listening music."
5,"""YOU CAN BOUNCE...right on into the groove""","Shanice, Shanice, Shanice...the girl can sing, the girl can dance and the girl has gotten better. I cannot believe that this is the same girl who was singing ""I Love Your Smile"" way back in 1993. She has grown so much. It sounds to me like she hasn't just grown physically and mentally but spiritually as well and that is a must if you want to last in this business. But juding from the way her new record sounds she'll be making us bounce much more. I see $$ in her millenium.. God bless."
5,Your emotions will run the gamut.,"At the Heart of Every Great Father, Clark Cothern's first book, was a joy to read. Cothern is a master story teller. He gives us everything from make-a-grown-man-cry dramas to hilarious humor. Most importantly, the stories are not just pleasant verbiage; they convey real issues that will make any father consider the awesome responsibility of raising our children well. The nine character qualities, or ""fruit of the Spirit,"" from the Bible are the basis for the chapters Cothern uses to teach us the personal strengths fathers need. While overtly Christian, the author does not preach at us. His principles will apply to any moral person regardless of religious background. If you enjoy the writings of Max Lucado or Chuck Swindoll, you owe it to yourself to read this initial offering from an author who is destined to be named among them someday soon."
4,A Nugget Of Joy From Me: It appears they DO listen!,"When I reviewed the last album, ""Musical Bar-B-Que"", I stated they left far too much out for the sake of the silly comedy spots. I also stated they should have put in a specific song. Well, the people spoke - the company listened. This CD is the PERFECT companion to the 1st album, and even as a stand-alone it does pretty well. I was a bit surprised there were no karaoke versions of any songs, but glad to see they continued the ""Something To Think About"" and ""Brak's School Daze"" segments!"
4,Savant idiocy from the Cartoon Planet,"If South Park is for the 8-year-old in all of us, then the gang from Cartoon Planet has its sights set on our inner first-graders, and boy, does it connect. The egomaniac Space Ghost and bitter Zorak take a back seat to everyone's favorite, Brak, who embodies the fundamental childishness of the entire enterprise. Particularly recommended are the two Italian lessons, Brak's rap ""Fight the Power Bands,"" and Zorak's plaintive ""It's Not Easy Being Evil."""
4,Good Book,"This book is a good Group therapy beginner's book. It explains the various aspects that must be considered. It is a fairly quick and easy read. Has class, individual and other kinds of activities included in the chapters."
3,disappointed,"What happened, Ms. George? This book dragged. Also, it seemed like the spark from the previous book was missing."
3,A solid work from a great artist,"This isn't the headbanging death metal you might expect from Zakk Wylde--it's southern rock a la Lynnrd Skynnrd with a touch of metal riffing here and there. Some times it works, some times it is silly--but throughout it remains Wylde's honest take on a popular genre of music. I didn't buy the disc because I heard this stuff on the radio; I bought it to learn more about Zakk Wylde, and I imagine anyone who buys this is a fan as well. I enjoy listening to him doing something diametrically opposed to his work with Ozzy Osbourne, and this disc is a far cry from Ozzy."
5,buyer beware. . .,"i bought this cd when it first came out a few years ago, when it was only a single disc. like an idiot, i lent it to my friend and i never saw it again. so a few weeks ago i found it again and was delighted to find that it had been re-released with some new material on a bonus disc. but when i played it, track 12, which is listed as ""found a friend"" (and actually WAS found a friend on the original) was completely different. even the lyrics to found a friend are printed with the new pressing, but it's a completely different song. found a friend was one of the best songs on the whole cd. . . it was slow and sad. . . good for drinking to. i'm not saying you shouldn't buy this cd. . . you definitely should. it's great. but if you can find the original version, with found a friend, you'd be much better off."
3,"Restful Revitalizing Sleep by Griswold,Robert","I did not feel totally relaxed after listening to the tape.It was like ok what is next?There was not enough mental imagery or physical relaxation steps to calm the inner mind.A hint in the instructions says ""For best results, listen to each program at leat 30 times.""I didn't want to spend that many hours to get resulta."
2,A HIGLY ANTICIPATED CD AND A TOTAL DISAPOITMENT,"THIS CD WAS DEFINETLY A SLEEPER THE ONLY REASON IT WAS WORTH LOOKING AT IS BECAUSE NAS AND DRAG'ON WERE FEATURED. MASE SOUNDS TO MUCH LIKE A LITTLE KID AND IS TO MUCH OF A PRETTY BOY. TO SUM IT UP IN ONE SENTENCE ""I HATE IT I HATE IT:"""
4,"I like it, I like it, I really really like it","The album is really cool, with the exception of the female, listen, that style works for ma$e, the ""dude"" not for stace the ""chick"". Not to discredit her by anymeans but the female competition is pretty steep, stace they will have you mesmerize, but nevertheless you still have to do your THING, I just wanted to enlighten you on a few. peace"
1,This cd is horrible.,"I couldn's wait to go out and cop this album but when i got it i realized i had waisted $17 on this garbage. You really can't get into this music. The only good songs on ""the movement"" are ""100 shiestys"" featuring drag'on and ""we both fronting"" featuring JD. Please don't waist your money. IT SUCKS, WORST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT."
5,Question,"What exactly does ""commercial rap"" mean? I haven't heard the CD so tell me what I'm supposed to be listening for."
4,"Good, but weak","This show is dedicated to men, like most of the people reading this. This dvd I must warn you men is censored. I kid you not. There is some vulgar language that is usually bleeped on even South Park but no nudity. Something that you would expect out of a show like this. In the girls jumping on trampolines there was blurred body parts and I was upset, I hope by the time the second one comes out there will be some more vulgarity. Oh yeah unlike most reviews I actually saw this dvd."
3,"A Few great tracks, mostly just ok","This album concept is kind of interesting, as I am a huge fan of the original Blonde on Blonde. However, most of the tracks on this record bore me, with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 tracks. The majority of the tracks are blues shuffles and such, but a few of the songs that stray away from the norm were actually the best. My three favorites by far were Clarence Bucaro's Sooner or Later One of Us Must Know, Eric Bibb's and Anders Osborne's tracks. One of us must know by Clarence Bucaro is the most interesting and has a warm, sexy, lounge style. It sounds like something right out of the 20's! Eric Bibb's track is great too, I would buy the record for those 3 tracks alone!"
3,great idea -,"but not a great album. I feel as the other reviewers did, that a few good songs can't save this bland collection. I mean, this is a classic album, so it would take some pretty terrific music to do it justice. It isn't here. The track I really liked, though, was Walter Trout's ""Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat."" I think he captured the rollicking leer of the original very well. Overall: stick with Bob's version."
5,Hail Caesar,"Strong, heavy album, superbly produced by Rick Rubin who has captured the Classic AC/DC sound better than anyone since the days of Mutt Lange. Favorites are Furor, Hail Caesar ,Cover you in oil and Ballbreaker with it's simple yet brutal riff. Johnson's voice is terrific here, and on Hail Ceasar. As I've said, this album sounds fantastic, uncluttered and dynamic. Great drum sound from Phil Rudd!"
3,Some things never change,"Another fine, although not really heavy, rock album. No surprises. However, the lyrics on this album are amazingly stupid, even by AC/DC standards. They sound even worse in the context of the mid-90's, when hard rock bands had been writing more serious, intelligent lyrics for the last few years. But it seems like AC/DC will just keep rolling on, oblivious to all that surrounds them."
3,Typical hard rocking AC/DC,"AC/DC has one speed and that is hard rocking...you can't fault the formula because it works...another rocking album, just be ready for the sound!"
3,Lacking...,"This album was very highly anticipated after a tapeworm of hits off of previous albums. Here, Brian Johnsons vocals are low mixed, and the guitar seems to drown out everything. Angus' riffs are getting stale and repititious, and the drumming is very generic. There are a few good songs here. 'All Hail Ceaser' is a great tune, the best here. 'Hard As A Rock' is pretty catchy, and 'Ball Breaker' is well-played and very funny lyric wise. Speaking of the lyrics, they are pretty well-written here. The other tracks, however - are stale and repitious for the above reasons. It is not a bad album by any standards, but this is in no way 'Back in Black' or 'Highway to Hell'..."
2,Save your money - the boys have lost it,"Anybody who thinks this is a five-star album should have their head examined. This isn't half the album of ANY of the BON SCott albums and is barely worthy of the Brian Johnson collection. It's not terrible, just a typically boring album like the last four or five (Razor's edge, blow up your video,Fly on the wall) these guys have put out. Angus, I think you're just collecting your paycheck now, mate. You've forgotten how to write songs or maybe the well has just gone dry. The lyrics are really stupid too, although I know most ACDC fans don't care about that. Please go back and listen to Highway to Hell and POwerage so you remember how you used to rock. This album has three or four okay songs, but the rest sound like they were written by a disturbed 12 year old, but I guess that's your target audience now, isn't it, Angus? Old Bon must be rolling in his grave."
5,Chmpion Hill - Out of the shadow of Vicksburg,Timothy Smith brings to life one of the most crucial battles for control of the Mississippi that has previously been overshadowed by the final Federal push into Vicksburg. The book is filled with eyewitness accounts and painstaking detail of every twist and turn of the battle. The ground they fought over is a reminder of the setting for the Battle of the Wilderness. A captivating read for Civil War history buffs.
4,very good,"A textbook for graduadte students or anyone who has already a good background in classical measure theory and is interested in nonadditive measures and nonadditive integrals. Although the necessary background is included in the second chapter, it is clear that a detailed study of ""crisp"" measures is necessary before reading this book. Although going deep into quite advanced topics the authors still keep the stutent's needs in mind - each chapter is followed by well chosen exercises. The appendices E (New Directions in Fuzzy Measure Theory) and F (Representative Applications of F.M.T.) show the possibility of next research and may be valuable for researchers and postgraduate students."
3,Prayer for Beginners,It was marked up on most pages in red ink. The seller had said that it was marked. It arrived quickly as the seller had said. It is a short book that I read quickly and passed on to a friend. I had never intended to add it to my library. It served my purpose.
2,The Ipaq 1935 CAN fit in this case!,"The aluminum is bendable, so you can squeeze the inside end clips in, to fit the IPAQ 1935. This worked very nicely.There is an inch or at the top that you don't need, but I still use this case, and find it adequate to protect the PDA. There is no other hard case which opens from the top, allows the USB/Charger plug to fit in the PDA while it is in the case, and allows the headphone to be plugged in. So.... I decided to keep the case .... until something better comes along."
1,Don't waste your money,The two hosts of this dvd went way too fast! It was almost impossible to follow. And the various demonstrations in between were incredibly boring!! These were set up to be conversations between friends and family members while incorporating a few signs to learn. Very boring. Don't waste your money.
3,Not the quality I expected,"Length:: 0:30 MinsIll be BriefI paid thirty-some bucks for this, but i received the quality you get from a 20-some bucks lamPros: Looks very niceCons: Feels very cheapOveral: looks nice, does its job, but too pricey for what it is"
5,Beautiful fixture!,I had this put in and simply LOVE it! It makes my kitchen seem so much classier and the finish matches the knobs on my cabinets! Perfect lighting too. I'm thinking of buying another one for my living room!
4,COOL!,WHEN I SAW THE VIDEO AND I ENJOY THE MUSIC. IT GIVES ME A GREAT IMAGINATION AND MAGIC SO I CAN LISTEN ALL THE TIME I NEED.
3,Ladino-English Dictionary,Dictionary is not as complete as I would like. There is no key to some of the symbols used for pronunciation.
4,Down home in Libbiville,"Libbi Bosworth is an enthusiastic and talented singer and songwriter. All too often I find that enthusiasm is used to mask a lack of talent, but in this case they co-exist nicely in the same package. This album is warm and welcoming, and very down home. You'll never regret a visit to Libbiville."
1,The most disapointing album of the year,This is just very boring album. Wu-tang forever and other wu music is much better than this. Don't buy it!
2,ehh.... not worth it,"i love the wu. but this album stinks. It seems that especially with hip-hop, artists are usually better while they are hungry. Sure, there are a few tracks that are worth listening to, but the overall value of this CD ... 36 by far remains their best album, and this album just doesnt nearly live up to it. It just seems as if they didnt put that much effort into this album. Not to mention that every song seems to have some special guest. Even Snoop is on this album, and while i like Snoop, his style doesnt really go that well with the Wu's."
2,WU TANG THE Wrost,"I'm sorry but this album is the wrost I've ever purchase.I got the Wu Tang 36 chamber and Wu Tang forever,those two album are good.Wu Tang,The W is the wrost album,Rza is losing his creation of his own music style.Rza has been producing alot of artist like method man,ol'dirty basturd,reakwon and many other of his own clan.Can he make a tight fast beat on there third album(The W)all the track I listen is weak!the song is slow,what the deal with that huh! C'mon Rza you can do better then that!"
5,This is their best work so far,"I've been listening to Wu Tang since they first came out~ i have all they're CDs and every solo job they did too~ and i m proud to say that this is The Tang's best work so far. The rymes are smooth,never choppy~like some of the other rappers~ but instead they flow steadily. If you like dark music~ like me~ it's a must you pick up this cd. Most of the songs are much darker and more violent than most other rappers. This a must for rap fans to get.Peace out, vinnie"
3,It's still WU,"It's WU so you can expect something a little better than most of the nonsense that's out there now, but this has got to be the worst WU album to date. The production is the only redeeming quality on some tracks, the lyrics on others. There's only a few where the two come to gether, Protect Ya Neck, Gravel Pit, Holow Bones, and Redbull get's a nob. RZA should never have put his name on some of the tracks. The guests seems out of place in their songs, except for Isaac Hayes and Redman.""Let My ... Live"" should have stayed in RZA's head,Ghostface Killah still doesn't make sense,All in all this album's no where near 36,I'll just have to keep playin' Liquid Swords and Cuban Linx."
2,Mediocre,"I bought this album cos Gravel Pit was fantastic and it had nas and snoop dogg on it but it is really sh*t. MC Conditioner, Protect ya neck and redbull are the worst on the album and 'i cant go to sleep' can be likeable the first time but soon sends you to sleep yourself.AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
3,"Good, but could have been much better.","I bought the album the day it came out. As a long time fan of the WU I'd say this album has improved over ""Forever"", but it hasn't matched the quality of ""Enter the 36 Chambers"". The celeb colabs from the likes of Nas, Snoop Dogg and Busta are great, but the WU isn't operating like the fluid unit there were once. Still this CD is a must for any Hip Hop fan's collection. The RZA doesn't disapoint."
1,No ODB killed this cd without him the whole cd wuz ruined,this is bad because it could have been better with no ODB in this there was no originality like in the 1st 2 wu tang cd's.i gotaa tell the truth here but ODB is o amazingly talented 4 real. Without him i wasted my money on this ODB if your on Wu's next album i will be the first in line but here's an example of what your wu tang buddies make without you so get back with the group and stop messin with the police.it had some good songs like gravel pit and the track with redman the rest were slow and like horrible rapping. if ODb had been there this cd would have been added to the wu tang saga and i am sorry to say i am dissapointed.wu tang still rules though and that will never change
5,Flashdance ballad - Grammy winner!,"Album originally released with 10 tracks. This Cd includes 3 bonus track, including ""Invitation To Dance"" (from ""That's Dancin'!"" soundtrack).Lyric sheet / booklet is no enclosed.4 tracks charted on Billboard Magazine:- ""Invisible Hands"" (Pop Singles #40, The Billboard Hot 100 #40 - 1983, The Billboard Hot 100 #97 - 1984);- ""You Make My Heart Beat Faster (And That's All That Matters)"" (Hot Dance Music/Club Play #15, The Billboard Hot 100 #54);- ""I Pretend"" (The Billboard Hot 100 #74 - 1984, Adult Contemporary #9);- ""Hurricane"" (Hot Dance Music/Club Play #16).Phil Ramone producer invited Kim to write and perform a ballad for a movie in the making titled ""Flashdance."" She co-wrote with Duane Hitchings and Craig Krampf ""I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is."" They ended up winnin' a Grammy for this song in 1984.February 1984 - Kim Carnes was nominated for a Best Pop Rock Performance (female) Grammy Awards , for ""Invisible Hands."""
1,Bad,This sword is terrible. This is not a sword. Its a piece of flimsy metal. The sheath is even worse. It doesn't feel like a real sword. I bought this for a costume and i wasn't pleased. The sword is bent and the sheath is already falling apart.
4,1st computer,"I bought this for my 2 yr. old grandson for Christmas. Both his parents use a laptop, so he thinks he's ""big"", too. I bought it a year early, I think. It will be a great learning tool in a year or two, lots of great features. I highly recommend it. AND, boys will love all the hotwheel sounds that it makes!"
3,Jazz 2nd time around,"I love Sheila E. She is one of the best Drummers in the world. This CD is ok, it's jazz driven so dont expect A Love Bizarre type CD. This CD is good for chillin and kickin back for that mellow groove feel"
4,Such a quirky little movie,"Although White On Rice is one of those movies that many will shun or cast aside in the first 20 minutes because it is too different for them, I believe that this movie has the ability to captivate anyone who is up to watch something different from the cinema norm. At points, the movie feels like it drags on, but interest is drawn back in quickly due to its cast of strange characters and its reflection on the craziness that comes along with any family trying to seem normal."
1,horrible waste of time,"This is a story about a loser. Normally I love movies and shows that center around underdogs. They're typically awesome:Dumb and Dumber (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray],Workaholics: Season One,Step Brothers (2-Disc Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray], and so on. Sadly this movie sucked really hard.The main problem with this movie is that there is nothing likable about the main character. He's not funny (really important), he's not naive, and he's just really creepy and annoying. He doesn't have any redeeming qualities. He is essentially a really horrible stereotype of a male Japanese office worker (an old creeper pervert). What's funny is everyone else in the movie does a decent job, so whenever the main character comes on onscreen it just feels like he's interrupting everything. I feel that with a change in the lead actor and a minor rewrite here and there, this could have be a good or decent movie... Anyways just skip this waste of time."
5,Pastry Board and Cloth Set,I used my pastry board last night for making lefse and it worked fine. My only reservation is that the cloth in the center of the board gave way and became wrinkled or crumbled.
2,Burn out...,This product got so hot that it melted into the power strip. It must be connected to rather low wattage lamp or else. It might have caused a really dangerous fire. Be careful!
1,Nice Features...but only in theory!,"Bought the SL-6008 wireless RF dimmer switch to activate a light located in a bedroom with the unit plugged in to an outlet out of sight in the bedroom closet. Like other reviewers of this product, features are nice but I need to be standing within 5 feet of the plugged in receiver for the remote to communicate with it. Tried fresh 12 volt battery with no improvement. Will be contacting Heath-Zenith for replacement or refund soon."
4,PSO Music of the batlefeild,Well all u Phantasy Stars out there. this is a good one for someone who is really into PSO. The CD is great I've listened to it @ a friends. if you love the Anime Music of PSO like I do You'll want this cd...
4,a damned punk classic,"this cd rips and tears from the very get go with ""Neat Neat Neat"" and doesn't really let up. a great punk rock album that deserves to be played ""loud at low volume."" haha"
4,Perfectly good battery for a good price,"It's hard to review a battery... this one works, and it holds a charge just as long at the Palm model. Having a back-up battery in your pocket is just good sense, since recharging isn't always possible (Frankfurt, Germany's airport has no power outlets once you clear security, for example)."
1,amazon's BAD business behavior,"I had been watching this book for a couple of months and finally I put this book into my cart before I went to lunch and would buy it after lunch.When I came back, amazon.com told me this book's price has just jumped up $5 MORE!!This is not about the money but the BAD PRACTICE of amazon's doing business. I'm not going to buy it from amazon again.This is not the first time happened to me. Sometimes after I put anything into the cart and didn't check out at once and then after a couple of hours the price went up.Why the price suddenly goes up? Because they know someone loved this book and then jack up the price.12/28/2011 Online chat with Amazon12/28/2011 Evening: price dropped from 21 some to $18 some12/29/2011 Afternoon: price drpped again back to $16 some (the price before +6)Sorry!!!! I'm not going to buy even it is $0.01 Its not about the $$ but my principle."
2,Ho-Hum..zzzz,"Well I guess if you like cardboard hero's this is the book for you. Drizzt might be the most one dimensional bore of a character I've ever read, he's like Dudley Do Right and Superman morphed into one superhero. The battle scenes (which pop up every three pages) have no suspense as our protagonist is the fastest, strongest, most well trained warrior ever, who also happens to have a 500 lb panther as a sidekick. On the other hand I did enjoy the rest of the drow and they're twisted society, it was somewhat fresh and original."
5,tu meke aue bay,"all i can say is chur bay. i never really enjoy fantasy books, but these are the puha patch. Salvatore is the man and his characters are not only great to read about but show real emotions and actually have CHARACTER. any one who hates boring dungeons and dragons or thinks fantasy is for nerds should give this any of Salvatore's books the goings over with the karu's.the more i read about Drizzt do'urdan the more i'm convinced he is a lost decendant from my Maori tribe. tu meke to this book."
3,"Love ti or loath it, why is there no midle ground","R A Salvatore is not a great writer, he will be in time but at the moment is is just good. The dark elf trilogy is not easy to get in to for the casual reader but it is fun and provides excellent lightweight reading."
4,Exactly what I expected,"While it will not count among the greatest literary works of our times. This book makes for a nice read. It provides some insight and a nice perspective into drow society from the viewpoint of an outsider and, I believe, serves as a nice backstory for the Drizzt character and how he came to be.All three books in the trilogy come in a single volume, though I would have preferred that they came separate which would make them easier to carry around (I do some reading in the train to/from work). But other than that, I'm quite pleased with the purchase"
5,not too sappy to give to a guy,"This book gives good tips about every aspect of an LDR, but at the same time it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are funny parts, like a list of how you know you're cut out for an LDR, suggested songlists for mix tapes, even suggested scripts for those monosyllabic types who might be bad on the phone. It's a relationship book that you can give to a guy--which I did, to my LDP (long-distance partner), who's in grad school in Wisconsin. Hopefully he'll follow some of the book's advice and pull off a surprise visit."
3,"Poppy, with some good ideas","I am in the fourth month of a long-distance relationship right now, and was looking for some tips and ideas on what works and what doesn't. This book is by no means a bible of LDR's, but it has a lot of little ideas that can't hurt, and has little anecdotal stories that can provide both an inspiration and a reality check. And it only took about two hours to read, as you can skim the parts that don't apply to your own personal situation. LDR's are a huge challenge, and if you're serious about doing it, then the $8 and the two hours this will put you out are probably more than worth it."
1,The Long-Distance Relationship Guide: Advice for the Geographically Challenged,"I bought this book looking for advice, but the read is hard and doesn't offer anything in my opinion that one should already know. I wouldn't bother with this one, I actually just sent it to the recycler. It is one of those books that you just HAVE to put down, not the other way around."
1,THE ALMOST PERFECT BANK ROBBERY,"BUYER BEWARE....THE COPY I WAS SOLD WAS IN A CARDBOARD SLEEVE... AND THE LISTING DIDN'T INFORM ME OF THIS FACT, EITHER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I HAVE NOT PULLED A DVD OUT OF A CARDBOARD SLEEVE YET, THAT WAS NOT SCRATCHED UP FROM THE GET-GO AND CONTINUED TO GET MORE SCRATCHED EACH TIME I PULLED IT OUT OF THE CARDBOARD SLEEVE. POOR WAY TO PACKAGE A DVD...WHICH SCRATCH EASILY, ANYWAY. :( BE SURE TO CONTACT YOUR SELLER AND ASK BEFORE BUYING IT."
5,c-murder my edol,Ive notice c-murder though tru from there album true he is my favorite rapper on nolimit and in the world he comes real with his rap and I think he need to do keep doing his thing and never stop
5,The phattest No Limit cd since Unpredictable!,"This cd doesn't have one bad song on it. My personal favorite is ""Like a Jungle.""This also has the tightest production from BBTP in a long time. C-murder is a great lyricist. No Limit 4 Life!!"
3,not his best,"C-Murder became very lazy on this one. It seems like he was forced to go into the studio. There is no real effort in his raps and he sounds lousy often. The energy he diplayed on Life or Death is not displayed here. The cut with Daz was good and the cut with Goodie Mob was straight too. Ride on Dem Bustas should have been promoted, but apart from these tracks, there is nothing new on Bossalinie."
2,???????????????,only 1 song worth bumpin and that's ride on my enemies which he had from a unreleased 2pac cd. please pass this by.
1,rip off,"C-Murder:I have an idea!Master P:What's that whodie?C-Murder:i'll copy one of tupac's unreleased songs word for word and dedicate it to him and fool people into thinking it's MY song!I'll just call it ""on my enemies"" instead.Master P:Cool, that's how we get down anyway. I heard cash money say whodie and i ran with it!(how stupid did they feel when the damn song ended up getting released on one of pac's posthumous albums?!)moral of the story-don't rip off a legend and then dedicate it to him.(cash money aren't legends,just wanted to show a pattern)"
4,"Thuggish. Not as hardcore as ""Life or Death""","C-Murder is one of the most talented young rappers out there in the game. He doesn't get the respect that he deserves because he is over shadowed by his brothers, Master P and Silkk the Shocker.He symbolizes hardness, realness, with a touch of what I like to say, ""Ghetto Poetry""."
2,"Doesn't hold a candle to ""Vertigo"" (or ""N. Star"" either)","If you dig ""Vertigo"" and were hopeful for more of the same from GA's latest, you may be disappointed with ""Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub).""There is nothing as groovy as ""Chicago,"" nothing as fun as ""If Everybody Looked The Same,"" and certainly nothing even close to a Chill Out anthem as ""At The River."" In fact, besides ""Superstylin'"" and ""Raisin' The Stakes,"" the rest of this 68 minutes is extremely ordinary and easily forgettable.The current 4.5 star review is overrated. Do yourself a favor and carefully preview this album before shelling out the $. Perhaps you'd be interested in purchasing a used copy?"
2,Feels too rough for a baby,"The material looked a little worn, as if it had already been through the washer a few times. It was a little rough to the touch, too. I would not have bought it had I seen it personally first."
4,teddy pendergrast,THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF MUSIC BY TEDDY PENDERGRAST. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ARTIST WITH A SENSUOUS DELIVERY OF HIS LYRICS. HIS MUSIC WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME AND WILL BE COPIED BY WANT-TO-BE'S LIKE JAY Z.
4,What went wrong? They should have been huge!,"""We Got the Neutron Bomb"" is one of the best songs ever. Too bad it's so dated. My ears recently stopped ringing from their St. Patricks Day '81 show at the Starwood in LA. John Denney dressed like a leprechaun and Dix Denney was Godzilla or something. If the world was just and ""Happy People"" was the giant blockbuster hit that it deserved to be, the 80's would have been completely different."
5,guaranteed to relax you whether at home or in the car,"this assortment of melodies is the perfect gift for the new mother, the new baby, or anyone else who wants to be stimulated by the classical sounds and soothed by the melodies. a definite must for the car - where much stress occurs in traffic jams."
2,HOODIE KILLER,"The movie starts out with a killing by a guy in a hoodie. We then go to Angie (Allison Tyler) and Brian (Zack Stewart) at a suicide support group. Both their parents committed suicide...her mom slit her own throat (a Philadelphia suicide) and they both worked at the same hospital. Brian and Angie both wear hoodies. Co-incidence? They both receive a VHS tape of their parents, with film shots from a stalker. VHS? Seriously? They both still own a VHS player to play the tape. Maybe their parents didn't commit suicide after all. Angie suspects the creepy neighbor. Or could it be Brian's roommate? Or do we care because the film is boring?F-bomb, sex, nudity (Jillian Toby) Allison in revealing tank top."
5,Like Catching Snow on your tongue....,"Beth Orton? Hmmm. What can be said? I want to give you an idea of her sound in case you haven't heard her before...but Im at a loss...I would say mix equil parts of Cowboy Junkies, William Blake, and the 'magic panio' records of the 1970's. Shes Magic!When I was in Rome earlier this year they were playing 'Stolen Car' almost as much as USA mtv was playing Nsync. So, when in Rome...I picked up the Cd and havent stopped listening to it yet. Its soulful, heartfelt, smooth and raw....If you like vocalists and are privy to folk or blues music...check this CD out... Very worthy of your time...xo"
5,Fantastic and beautiful,"A beautiful album that gets better with every listen ( - but you have to give it a chance rather than listening once and discarding). And if you get the chance, try and see her live - it's an amazing experience."
5,Excellent and Honest Work,"This is a great follow-up to Trailer Park. If, as the above review says, she's like Beck, it's like the Beck of ""Mutations"", not ""Odelay"". Don't expect hip-hop, found sounds, and Afro-Cuban sampling. This album is much more straight-forward than that. The arrangements certainly venture away from folk, but they are never cloying. The best word I can think of to describe the music of ""Central Reservation"" is ""honest"". Her voice is so perfect, it elevates everything around you.If you're looking to take a chance on an artist you've never heard before, get this album.By the way, it bears mentioning that Beth may be familiar to some listeners as the eerie, lilting voice on the Chemical Brothers' Dig Your Own Hole."
5,Simply Brilliant!,"Following the style she set forth on Trailer Park, Orton presents a beautiful singing voice set against haunting arrangments. The sometimes lush background (a nice departure from Trailer Park and Best Bit) never overwhelm Orton's vocals which rightfully takes center stage. Her collaboration with Terry Callier on ""Pass in Time"" is a nice follow-up to their magical pairing on Best Bit's ""Lean on Me."" The wait was worth every moment for this outstanding record.Beth, it's great to see you smiling on the inside sleeve! You have every reason to be happy."
4,Cute accesory,"Got this because my Secret Santa assignment said she loved horses, her favorite color was pink, and she wanted a new keychain. From what I've seen since she got this she has not been disappointed."
2,umm....,"I didnt like this item....the back is open & you cant tell from the picture shown If you are big ""up top"" you are not fitting into this...I guess I just didnt like it the girl in the picture looks way hotter in this I will just let her wear it :) O plus I recieved the item a week late..."
5,Very up-beat and dancable.,I love the song. E.Y.C. is much better than 'N SYNC or Backstreet Boys. I love them!!!!!!
4,A Lot to Like!,"I don't agree with all McLaren's tenets, but I do like his relational approach to evangelism and his perception of faith as a journey--a process-and seldom a ""punctiliar"" conversion. This is a good book to get people thinking and talking about the various aspects and dimensions of evangelism. I like his nonjudgmental approach to evangelism and, in his words, we are all ""stories in progress surrounded by stories in progress."""
4,dont miss,"Carter Burwell is possessed with great feeling and sensibility. The first four tracks are worth the price of entry. Evocative, stirring, brooding. Play at 10 and worry the neighbors!"
4,Classical layman opines,"This is a good compilation for people with a large, gaping, hole in their brain where knowledge of what's what and who's who in classical music should be, like me!This is just a good, solid compilation with the sole directive of chilling out. I'd also recommend Aphex Twin: Ambient Works Volume 2."
4,Excellent content - please improve the photos,"This book consists of 2 sections. The first section describes guitar components and guitar making tools. The second section describes various steps used in building a variety of different guitars. The book also lists vendors of guitar parts.This book is very detailed and comprehensive. There are many practical suggestions and the writing is clear. There are no actual detailed plans. You are required to develop your own design. There are many guitar plans available from the internet so this is no problem. You must have some minimum wood working skills.I give the book a 4 star rating because the small black and white photos are difficult to see. For any future edition, please use better quality photos to illustrate the work done. Also for any future edition, it would be interesting to include design ideas for pickup coil auto-winding devices, custom bridges, custom tailpieces and custom designed headless tuning systems."
4,DUTCH TRANCE MASTER DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"I AM A HUGE FAN OF TIESTO....""JUST BE"" ISN'T MY CUP OF TEA REALLY, BUT THE DUBS ARE OK...THE KUDOS FOR ME HERE IS THE FULL-LENGTH MIX OF ""ANCIENT HISTORY"", A TRIBAL TRANCE ANTHEM BY ALL SENSES...ONE OF THE BIGGEST AMD BEST TRANCE RECORDS IN MY BOX, AND IT WILL PROBABLY STAY THERE FOR AT LEAST A DECADE..."
4,One of his best!,"Rev. Billy fans know that his work is a mix of hilarity and incredible blues piano playing, but for new fans, the Rev's style of music is blues about evangelism, wrestling and other highlights of white trash pop culture. In this album, the Rev seems to be taking a more ""mature"" (in the sense of getting older, rather than wiser) look at life, and as someone who owns all of his albums, this one has some real gems. ""I'm Not Too Old For You"" is an amazing flash of brilliance, even for the Rev, and ""What Did I Do?"" is in the vein of his many other ""relationship problems"" songs, but contains extra brilliance. If you ever get the chance, go see the Rev live, as it's always impromptu and full of audience participation."
5,"If you get only one Hedges, make it this one","Awesome display of Michael Hedges' prodigious talent, where it shines most: in his playing [this anthology has only one abbreviated vocal, and it's a tiny moment you'll really enjoy]. Cosmic tablature and wild percussive effects so basic/complex that it's hard to imagine they come from one solo acoustic guitar. The good news: you get to hear samples from his whole career, as he cheerfully but aggressively bashes in one aural door after another. The bad news: we will hear no more from this uncommonly gifted artist."
5,Loved by adults and kids,"I first bought this sauce when a local chief recommended using as base (with butter, plum wine, water, shallots, ginger, and garlic) for pork (yum) but it turned out my picky son LOVES chicken marinated in it (wouldn't eat chicken previously, now it's a favorite - thanks Koon Chun - he also will only eat steak with their BBQ sauce). I am writing this review as I make another order (for both). Shipping is a couple of dollars less at reseller's web site."
2,Shipped Quickly - but item not as pictured,"The item I received was not as pictured. Granted...it was just gum, so it's not the end of the world. But I would have thought with something so basic they would have sent what was pictured. I received 2 packages of different kinds of mint vs. the assortment shown."
4,A thourough guide but missing an engine!,This was a very complete and thourough guide to the GM series as well as the 4JH and 4JH Turbo models. The book is easy to read yet detailed enough for the serious mechanic/machinist. My only negative comment is that the manual over looked the 3JH series completely. I believe this oversight should be corrected in future versions.
3,dog slippers to protect wood floors,"I purchased the slippers to prevent scratches on our new wood floors. Our dog is 55 lbs. of muscle and sometimes hyperactive. Unfortunately, even with careful manicures, he creates long gashes in our floor from running and sliding. We were only able to put the front slippers on Cooper because he resists slippers on his back feet. When the slippers stay put they do prevent scratches, but he often wiggles out of one or the other throughout the day. His dew claw seems to be right where the slipper's strap encircles his ankle. The more expensive kinds have elastic at the opening; in hindsight, I realize the importance of the fit. I do like that they are washable and seem to be comfy on. He will give me a baleful look when I velcro them on, but after that he will ignore them."
1,Keep falling off,I tried so hard to make these fit. My dog was great. I thought he may try to pull them off. He didn't. What did happen was the boots falling off his paws as he walked around for a very short period of time. Nothing seemed to work. I measured his paws as was instructed. They just keep falling off.
5,Perfect Fit,This product arrived fast and fit the vehicle perfectly. Quality product and exact replacement for OEM part.
1,It's a waste,"I heard this cd from my friends brother and thought it was the worst thing that I've ever heard. The cd is just a bunch of theme songs from different wrestlers, which is boring. it would have been a lot better if it was a bunch of hard rock songs, then mabye I would have liked it a little. Wrestling is the gayest sport ever made. Save your money, PLEASE."
2,Re-relase capitalizes on current fad,"This album is nothing more than a blatant attempt to make back the money they lost when this album was originally released. I bought my copy two years ago for 99 cents! The content itself isn't that great, with the exception of the title track, which was actually used as the WrestleMania theme song during WWF commercials for a couple of years. If you want wrestling music, stick to the ""WWF The Music"" series. This isn't worth more than the buck I paid for it!!"
3,Too Many Empty Tracks,"I'm a pretty big OTC and E6 fan, but this cd doesn't do to much for me. There are several standout tracks like Hideaway, Peculiar Noise Called ""Train Director"", and I Have Been Floated, but there is also an annoying abundance of experimental tracks that are quite paltry compared to the aforementioned songs. The members of OTC are creative, excellent musicians, but the overly repetitive motif that they created for this disc is to much. Given those recurring instrumental snippets are interesting, but I think they're completely devoid of the real alluring music that OTC could make. My recommendation would be to buy Dusk at Cubist Castle before this. If you're a serious OTC and/or E6 fan, buy this, otherwise, stick to the other more straightforward cds that the Elephant 6 collective has to offer."
3,An Ideal Husband,My attempts to broaden my literary experience included this selection by Oscar Wilde. It was my first experience with this author and I have no idea if it rates as one of his better works or not. It is worth reading for those who do have a love of classic literature.
2,I thought this was a book. It's a play.,I'm not interested in reading who has what line or what the settings should be. I thought I was getting a book-it's not-so I didn't get past page 2.
2,"Good product, bad description","The shorts were top-notch quality, but they weren't what I wanted. The product's description did not adequately tell me what I was purchasing, so I had to send them back."
3,From the hearts of nurses,The most trusted profession. Most nurses have stories like this etched on their hearts.This inexpensive tome shares short essays of transformatory caring.
4,tons of great forms for everyone,"All this stuff you can find on the internet, but finding them is the challenge. There are great forms for everyone, not just businesses, like basic contract form from everything from accepting a job to hiring a contractor to do work on your home. They nice thing is that you can look through the forms to see which have the information you are interested in, then you can fill them out on your computer with the CD forms that is included. It's a great reference book for everyone."
4,Maria Christensen's catalog?,"Hearsay is that Maria Christensen was in this duo and went on to do two solo albums (MaRIA ChRISTEnSEN and Beautiful Now, a 2007 follow up) and albums with 3rd Party.Maria ChristensenAlive"
5,Your little one can learn their letters and sounds in a flash!,"I bought this set for my son at the recommendation of a relative that used to teach preschool. He was 5 and starting kg, but struggling with letter recognition and sounds. He enjoyed the DVDs and would watch them over and over at least once or twice per day. Within 3 weeks of watching the ""Letter Factory"" and ""Talking Words Factory"" DVDs, he knew all 26 letters and their sounds. These DVDs are amazing!The little flash card set that comes in the set came in handy. One side shows the letters while the other side depicts a scene from ""The Letter Factory"", sparking your child's memory to help them remember the sound made by the letter. I am so thankful for these DVDs and flash cards!! They have really made a huge difference for my son."
4,Was for gifts,I purchased one set for my 3 year old nephew and one set for my 3 year old grandson. They were gifts so I am not surehow they will like them. I hope they will think they are fun.
4,80's-tastic.,Incredibly-great bad movie. Sam Elliot with a great supporting role. Don't overlook this just because of the Swayze factor. Decent special features (Kevin Smith included.)Great flick.
5,Road House,"I love the movie but I do NOT like WIDE SCREEN. That is why I have taken it off of my wish list. Please add more of his movies that are NOT WIDE SCREEN, please."
5,A great movie if u want to see what small bar or club bouncers do,This is the type of movie u watch. If u wanna see what small bar and club bouncers do. If u watch this movie its a great time filler.plus it never gets boring.so u wont fill cheated.try it u might like it.
1,The greatest,"When can a movie be the greatest and still get one star? When it's the greatest drive-in movie ever made. People sometimes call entertainingly bad movies car wrecks. Well, this isn't a car wreck; it's more like a monster truck rally. It's doing exactly what it's supposed to do, but you can't believe how serious it is. And as for the viewer who called it ""perhaps the most sophisticated action film ever made,"" I can only quote our psuedo-existential hero, who says, ""Opinions vary."""
5,Wet g-string competition.,"I'm so glad that Kevin Smith talked about this movie on the Clerks DVD so that I would hear about it. This is such a ridiculous and ridiculously enjoyable movie. It's so violent, and there's sex and explosions and a monster truck running over cars. There's this one part where Dalton rips this guy's throat out with his bare hands. From the night Dalton gets hired for a new gig to the climactic scene where *EVERYBODY* shoots the evil Ben Gazzara with a shotgun, this movie is incredibly fun.Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier's commentary is hilarious."
2,Overpriced and Underwhelmed,I was under the impression that the volume (an overview of the many seasons of The Golden Girls)would be lavishly illustrated and well-written. It was neither. I have purchased books like this for far less and the quality was so much better.It was a mistake that I will be careful to never make again. There are also grammatical errors and misspellings in the text. But I suppose that it's the only viewing guide on The Golden Girls available. But ultimate is pushing it.
2,Yoga to the rescue,"It sounded like a good way to ease into yoga with my muscles being so tight. And the positions are great! However, the hostess does and intro for each pose and goes on and on about it and there is no alternative way to watch the DVD. I wanted to hear the intros a couple times and then play the poses without all the chatter after I'd learned them."
5,The Fourth Horseman,"An educator told me about this book while visiting Front Royal, VA. So glad I ordered the book from Amazon. It's an eye opener."
2,The *Irrelevant* Guide to Amsterdam,"This guide really doesn't live up to the promise of its title. I can't find anything irreverent about it, except for an occasional potshot at some local attraction. Its clear biases against coffeeshops, a major feature of Amsterdam life, and its skimpy treatment of both the restaurant and hotel scene made it fairly useless. The maps are inadequate: many important streets are missing, and we often found ourselves lost. (Fortunately, we were able to find a Michelin Guide at a local bookstore that gave us the more complete information we needed. This is not a book to rely on if you need much information about hotels, restaurants, or attractions in and about Amsterdam."
5,An irreverant guide for an irreverent city...,"Amsterdam pulses and buzzes with life, and a weary traveler can either get caught up in it, get run over by it, or stand and watch it from a safe distance. ""Irreverent"" features activities for any of these three speeds. This guide book accompanied me on a five month stay near Amsterdam, and it never let me down when I needed entertainment. It's smart suggestions and wry humor gave a good context from which to view the city, its inhabitants and habits. The recommendations for museums, concerts and resturants were second to none. Also, the author's descriptions of establishments accurately reflected the prevailing costs. The maps made a handy tool for any lost traveler, and it provided the neccesary warnings regarding the excesses for which Amsterdam is famous without shying away or judging. ""Irreverent"" was the guide I used the most in that neighborhood of Europe and I encourage other travelers to do the same."
5,Great work book,"My twin girls love Math Minutes books. These are their 3nd ones. They can not wait to do it. Also, they use stopwatch to track how fast they can finish each page."
5,exellent book,"i wanted to learn how to use photoimpact7 ,i found this book very easy to follow and have and have made big progress and created some beautiful things for the web, with the help of this book i love this book and do not find learning easy so it must be good."
4,Chilling tale of horror,"This is a chilling, well-written novel. The outstanding use of cliffhangers keep you frightened and on the edge of your seat. The intense descriptions and details make you feel like you are part of the novel, and that you are seeing what goes on. This novel had a fearful plot that portrays some of Stephen King's works. My recommendation is a strong one, but for readers of an older age, because this is an original tale of horror that may frighten younger readers."
1,"this man is mentally disturbed, steer clear of this paranoid pamphlet",This fella is the same peron who in the late 90's and early 2000's destroyed dozens of internet canoeing and kayaking news groups with his ramblings and barely coherent mass spamming attacks and bizarre rambling e-mailsThis pamphlet is a collection of his bizzare paranoid ramblings with no actual layout or plan.He rambles on about organizations such as the coast guard and the american canoe association and any one else he claims is in on the plot to keep his product he manufactures from the masses so they can kill as many people as possible.He's a wack job who cant write.The book would make a good coaster or maybe kindling in case you needed to start an emergency fire.whooo hoo- earth to Tim - put the tin foil hat back on now..DO NOT BUY THIS BOOKDont encourage this sad individual by buyinhg his self published pamphlet.nuf said
5,Looptroop - Modern day city symphony,"Allright, for you who don't know, Looptroop (Promoe, Supreme, CosM.I.C. & DJ Embee) are together a swedish hiphop band, that's been doing rap for 10 years or so. Modern day city symphony is their first long play album, and i think it's even better than the new 'The Struggle Continues' album, but that is ofcourse only my opinion =) All the songs are really dope on this album, and the beats are really well done and kicking!I can only recommend this album to all hiphop fans!At www.looptroop.nu you can find some info about the band."
2,"Great price, poor quality","Was doing rear brakes and couldn't turn the old drums, so I ordered these. The price for these drums was WAY less than the chain auto parts stores. So I took a chance on them. When I took them out of the box they looked very solid and heavy. Nothing cheap in the appearance. But after installation, I ended up with a pretty bad vibration when braking. Reinstalled old drums and no vibration. So something was out-of-round in one of the new drums. Decided to just use old drums and returned these. I may have just had a bad draw, but who knows. The price may be worth taking a shot, especially since Amazon will pay return shipping if you get a bad one."
5,A Real Treat,"I was lucky enough to see this band play dozens of times in Austin and they never disappointed. I certainly never anticipated having this music on CD, but man does it still sound great! I'm just blown away that these four kids from Texas created what's now a fusion classic. Each original cut positively sizzles. My only teensy tinsy quibble is with the subpar audio quality of the two live bonus tracks. Sounding like a bad bootleg recorded on a single microphone in the audience, they're not much of a bonus. I guess they provide proof that the Magnets had awesome chops in a live setting as well, but hey, I already knew that!"
4,"Enjoy ""The Invisible Invasion"" and cut Sony out of the equation.","Not a review so much as, perhaps, good news for Coral fans. Maybe I'm stating the obvious, but if you purchase the import version of this cd on Deltasonic (I have the 2 disc version which contains 8 BBC Session tracks on disc 2) you won't have to suffer Sony's version which, when I put the disc in my computer, opened up a ""player"" that did not give me an option to import the tracks (at least not that I could find, and with the other reviews that mention Sony's ""safety"" measures, I never inserted that dirty, dirty disc into my innocent laptop again). Of course, you could purchase MP3 downloads too, but if the import info didn't dawn on you right away either, maybe I've helped some Coral fans access The Invisible Invasion which is necessary to your collection without Sony's intervention."
3,Unsure as yet on this one,"The Coral fire off their 4th album in 4 years and this one has me scratching my head in puzzlement. It is a good album, but is it more? Does it compare to the others? Where does it stand in the full sound of the band?The answers are that The Coral's albums all sound totally different from one another, yet after 3 albums this one their 4th does seem familiar... but of course it will. The thing is... it doesn't really sound like their prior releases, yet there is a huge familiarity. ""The Operator"" sounds like something from the mini-album ""Nightfreak & The Sons Of Becker"" but that is really where the album comparisons can be drawn.I would place this somewhere in the middle of The Corals releases, it is definitely not the best, but it is probably the most interesting of the 4."
3,Engaging erotica which beckons consideration.,"The book makes a subtle display tool at my salon. For women who never allow themselves to express their own sexuality without shame.... well its a confidence booster. A neccessary catylist for self acceptance,this little pillow book stirs the imagination...ones very spirit is set free! Set free to discover explore and express. Thankyou Ms. Torres"
3,Why not teach one instrument at a time?,"Even though I don't personally own this DVD I've seen a video clip of it on the Homespun Tapes website. Its pretty good but David Holt teaches all the instruments on the DVD and its really impossible to learn all the instruments in one DVD. Even though David Holt is a great teacher, I think he should teach one individual instrument on seperate DVD'S."
4,The Tylenol Sore Throat Maximum Strength Adult Acetaminophen ...,"The Tylenol Sore Throat Maximum Strength Adult Acetaminophen Liquid worked well in clearing up my sore throat. I didn't care for the taste, but it did help me to feel better. So if someone just wanted to feel better and didn't care what it tastes like, then I'd recommend this product."
3,Alright,"This novel was fairly decent:it had an alright plot, it was written somewhat well, and was interesting in most parts. I did not like this novel, however, because i had to read it as a school assignment. I think that because of that, it took all of the pleasure out of the novel, and i didn't have time to appreciate certain things about the novel.I also did not like the ending of the novel. I felt that it didnt explain well enough what happened to Crabbe.Overall, this book would definitally be more enjoyable if you were not pressed for time to read it, and then have to do a load of work on it."
4,great help for Hebrew vocabulary memorization,"While most Biblical Hebrew textbooks take noble strides to acquaint students with basic vocabulary skills and memorization, a vocabulary guide like Van Pelt (or Landes) really equip the student with memorizing power. Don't waste your time memorizing words that only occur in BH a few times-this guide allows you to memorize the words of BH in descending word order frequency, thereby supplying the student with the skills early on to begin reading BH without too much help from lexicons and dictionaries. Also includes helpful statistics for the various verb forms that appear in BH."
4,Root for Hebrew,"This book is partitioned with multiple sections for learning Hebrew vocabulary, including frequency or words and by Hebrew root. For learning large portions of Hebrew vocabulary quickly, learning words sharing the same root is the most efficient method of acquiring Hebrew vocabulary proficiency. This feature, along with checking frequency of occurrence, is the strongest strength of this book.What may surprise the user of this book is the relatively small amount of vocabulary needed to be learned to recognize a large portion of the Hebrew text.For additional memory helps in learning Hebrew vocabulary very quickly I would recommendBiblical Hebrew: Vocabulary Made Easy!that provides memory helps or ""mnemonics"" for each words to learn Hebrew vocabulary quickly with a minimum of time and effort."

5,A MUST for anyone with Cancer,"If you know anyone with cancer, bless their socks off by giving them this CD. It is like listening to new Psalms. The songs are infused with ministry that goes deep into your spirit. I've listened to it for years and never grow tired of it because the Holy Spirit speaks to my heart everytime I listen to it. It is so much more than ""nice music""!!"
2,HG is too long winded in this book,"In the begining of the book, HG's sentences are whole paragraphs long and 3 pages to explain one emotional responce"
5,The Best of Lynrd Skynyrd review,"i have always had fond memories of this group and recently, while surfing, saw this item at a great price so i could not resist.i have purchased many items from the: [20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection] and have been happy with all."
3,compost,"I think it's just as easy to nail some old wood crates together to get the same result. You will place this in a out of the way place anyway and it takes a long time for the material to break down. It's like forget it. It fills up quickly. Take a composting class so you have a better idea of what you need. The product was easy to put together, but then so would nailing four wooden crates together giving you more storage."
2,The Tomorrow People,The tomorrow people is a 1960's style. Everything is peace related and child like. A child might be able to get through the show.
3,interesting,This movie is very easy to follow but isn't that grasping. I mean it is one of the better movies with CHristoper reeves in it. And has a interesting plot to it but I just do not prefer watching it
3,Not Camilo's finest hour,"The POTO stuff was a no-brainer for me, and it had nothing to do with Camilo's vocals or accent. I'm one of the minority who detests - ick! ptooie! - POTO. Not even Michael Crawford could save it for me. As for the non-POTO material, it's mostly ok (well, the re-working of Fresa Salvaje did make me laugh -- still got those hokey background singers doing their thang!). This isn't Camilo's best work, and I agree with a previous reviewer who said this cd is strictly for diehard fans of Camilo (and not POTO fans). I count myself among Camilo's fans. I saw him in concert once, in Zaragoza in 1977. What a blast! A bunch of us were singing 'Alguien' on the bus taking us to the show. I have only the best memories associated with Camilo's music."
5,Only face wash that works for me,"I dealt with acne problems for many years, went through countless acne-fighting products. I've used all the face washes (salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide), used the astringents and spot-treatments, and tried the natural stuff. I've found this to be the most effective product for me. I use it once a day as face scrub in the morning, and at night I use a mild cleanser. I've been using this for about 2 years now, and have been acne-free the whole time. Definitely use a lotion afterwards though, because this will dry out your skin. And use white face towels, because this will bleach the color out of anything else."
1,wizard of oz 4 movie collections,"I did not like the video at all due to the fact that it was not like the original movie at all. It showed it in the old, old, type of movie, fast movements, no sounds, had to read fast what they were saying. Was nothing like the original movie. I also ordered the original movie, The Wizard of Oz and was lost in the mail and was to be credited but have not yet seen the credit."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I really enjoy listening to this as i do my homwork or whatever. I recieved it as a gift when I was Sally in a local production. The director had added ""My New Philosophy"" (who knows why it was soooo hard!) but listening to this helped, and now my brother also knows it by heart and we sing it together. even thought my show was 2 years ago, it's still a fave to pop in the player if i'm down and want to hear all the joys of childhood on one track, ""Happieness."" (did i spell that right? =D ) but really, it is worth it! =)"
2,This version definately not as well done as original,"If you have seen or heard the original ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,"" you will be dissappointed with the new version. Poor Lucy has such a shrill voice that the wonderful (one of my favorites in the original) Moonlight Sonata song is totally lost. Also, the best piece is simply missing from this new recording- Snoopy's Red Baron. Some of the pieces are great though- The Book Report on Peter Rabbit and Charlie Brown's ""If I Start Writing Now."" This release will make you remember the original fondly and wish your record player still worked."
4,great casting,"good cast and i'm really a Broadway fan, so i truly appreciate this musical. :)you will not regret purchasing it."
5,Funny and entertaining!,"I can be rather picky when it comes to Broadway musicals, but You're a Good Man Charlie Brown is at the top of my list along with Wicked and Phantom of the Opera. Mix great vocalists and performers with funny lyrics and catchy tunes, you've got You're a Good Man Charlie Brown. A light-hearted show, I would recommend this musical to anyone who loves Peanuts, Broadway, or hilarious and entertaining songs."
3,"Good exercise, poor filming","As other reviewers have said, this series of poses does invigorate and energize. The only problem is the filming (as others have said). The shots are very often from a distance and in shadows which make it difficult to know what Shiva Rea is doing, especially when she is doing the mat work. This also creates a situation which can cause serious injury for a novice who does not understand the poses and what she is doing. At one point, it is virtually impossible to see what she is doing as she moves her leg and knee across her body and then twists. This is definitely a video for someone familiar or experienced in yoga or someone who has seen Shiva Rea in other videos and understands her poses. I did love the way it energized and calmed and the flow of the poses as I like Yoga that continually moves."
2,Wow... Just wow.,"Um, yeah. If you want to watch a movie with really bad acting and special effects, then have a party and invite all your friends. But seriously, that's all it is. Another thing: Usually the main character is the prettiest one, but no. In this movie, the main character's sister is really pretty while she's like... what some would call second rate. She's just average. Her sister takes the spotlight away from her when they're in a scene together. It's like... what's the point? Oh, and the ending is like so abrupt and stupid. I was like ""Really... that's it?"" Not worth the time...... but if you know about all of this stuff (like acting and special effects and stuff), it's a really funny movie to watch. Especially at 1:30 in the morning."
2,Didn't work on XP,"But it did work on my windows 95 computer for a little while. Then, it started having technical difficulties on there too. Probably will perform best on a windows 98 computer. Good luck!"
3,Nothing Fantastic,"I wasn't very satisfied with this book. It bored me REAL quick. Heck, I almost fell asleep reading it. It's not a bad book, it's just that it's nothing fantastic."
1,Is this meant to be Eberron?,"The idea behind the novel may not be too bad, but honestly I'm about half-way through and am not sure if I will finish. I wish I had known that the War Torn series books are stand alones, I would surely have gotten the James Wyatt book instead.There are so many errors (beyond the typos) that I'm not sure if the author even so much as knew what Eberron is. Someone mentioned the half-elf with the Orien mark already, but he can't even get the basic physics right. The fugitives travel on foot from Voorkesh to Taeris Mordel in one day, which is fine until you look at the book's own map and see that it is about a 300 mile journey (and through mountains yet!). So forget Eberron, there's no sort of internal coherence in the story at all.I'm sorry I just can't suspend that much belief."
2,Not what I expected,"This is my second Chris Falson CD purchase. It just seems a bit canned. He uses electronic-sounding background stuff, more what I would expect from a new age type of recording. Some people might like that type of music, but I prefer his album The Quiet much more."
4,Black Digiflex Exercise System - 9 Lbs,"Very well built. I was going to buy a different system but after reading someone else's review on that other brand I decided it wasn't very well built. When comparing features with this one and the other brand, the digiflex does not have ""ridges"" to help a guitarist build finger callouses, but I certainly don't need that as I have plenty of my own! I bought it primarily for guitar fretting hand strengthening and guessed on the poundage. Nine pounds is a bit stiff for my smaller fingers (ring and pinky), but great for the bigger fingers (I'm 56); however, I'm sure I'll appreciate the strength later on. Also, it's a bit difficult to do thumb exercises, but I suppose it's better than most. Though I have not yet used the other brands, I believe this one is the best on the market. If 9 pounds is too strong for you, remember that they make a variety of strengths."
3,toontastics cartoons,I would like to have one of the songs on this cd but I'm wondering why is the cd so expensive? can't you provide an mp3 download off this cd
5,McCaffrey at her best,"The Ship Who Sang kicks off a series by McCaffrey. Some of the later books were collaborations, but this one is 100% McCaffrey and a great start it is.Helga is well-portrayed and the reader (me) has no trouble caring for what happens to her.One of McCaffrey's ""trademarks"" is the uniqueness of her settings and story background. Some resonate with me and others don't. This one was a home run!"
4,Good fun book,This was a good fun book. If you like a good story and don't require your science fiction to be strong on realism you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for hard SF and need everything to be realistic this isn't the book for you.
1,Undeveloped in several areas,"Ok, right off the bat you have a brain separated from its body. How such an organ operates without sensory input is, well, better left to the science fiction writers. Anyway, the brain not only thinks but talks and even sings, with the ""voice of an angel"". Yes, I know this is a physical impossible without a mouth but hey, this is the space age and anything goes.While exploring and practicing for the Met, Ms Brain (Helga) suddenly discovers Mr. Right who, unfortunately happens to be a ""real"" person who is ""really"" attached to his brain. You'd think with all her great powers she could simply invent the perfect mate and do bad things in cyberland. But she wants the real McCoy and on the way battles a lot of bad guys. What can you say? It's like a combination of the worst of the original Star Treks (gorgeous aliens and cardboard rocks) and one of those ""books for the wellbred teenage young lady"". Belongs in the Romance Section."
3,Too Much Dogma,My Dog Skip and My Cat Spitz Mcgee were excellent works. Unfortunately his autobiographical work North Toward Home deviates into liberal philosophy to the point of distraction. I enjoyed some of the background material about his life and admire him personally for what he did with his life. I don't really need someone preaching liberalism. We get enough of that on the Evening News.
3,easy to use but has some growing pains.,"this product works well and is a great price but after i installed it i found that it did quite a bit of expanding and contracting with the flux in temp. in some places it wasnt that bad, like where i had dug a trench and it was part way under ground, in those areas it didnt move much but in other areas like along my driveway where it is setting on the cement it has buckled and bowed to the point where it has moved 3-4 inches from the end where i had used the spike to fasten it down and it compleatley slid out from under the spike. not a bad product just not great to use in certain applications."
5,"CD sounds better than LP, the original LP had no lyrics","Like all Max Webster CDs, the re-mastering makes the CD sound much better than the original LP version.While some other Max Webster LPs had a lyric sheet, this recording did not, thus you are not missing out on anything with the exclusion of lyrics on this CD.The CD is about 36 minutes long, same as the LP.Of all Max Webster recordings, this is the most experimental. It is much like Frank Zappa, especially with regard to the lyrics.Right now, the best bet for the money as the original LP contained no lyrics.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,Prepare to be underwhelmed,"If you're hoping to get something along the lines of ""in search of sunrise 1, 2 or 3"" or any of tiesto's earlier mixes then don't get this trash. Tiesto has run his coures and is no longer relevant. Don't misunderstand me - I'm a fan of tiesto - it's just that this album doesn't deliver the goods. It's derivative, redundant and flat out cheesy. Look into his other mixes such as isos or the magik mixes (6 & 7 are top notch) or of course Nyana (the last good thing this guy put out). DJs have a shelf life and I'm afraid tiesto's has expired."
2,*Yawn*,"This cd makes me want to take a nap. I was hoping for a more energenic, bob your head kind of album. This is a slow down, get ready for bed type album. If you need some music to put you to sleep...pick this up. Dissapointing production by Tiesto with only 1 solid track (#2)."
2,Trading experimentation with laziness,"2 1/2Along with their bloated full length WMTW, Tarentel's Paper White EP signified the end of a formerly intoxicating band's melodic enslavement into something far clunkier and uninspired. Whatever point the group decided to hop around to undercooked tempos while letting nearly all that used to be musically sublime dry out around heroin drumming was truly the nail in this promising band's artistic coffin."
5,Looping Q & A : 72 practical Answers to your Most Pressing,"As a teacher just beginning the looping process this book has been extremely helpful. It is quick and easy to read and will continue to be a valuable resource. It addresses questions not only from an educator's standpoint but also a parent's standpoint. It will continue to be of use to me before, during, and after the looping process begins."
3,Wonderful but...,"""The Romantic"" was, overall, a great read but it still left me wanting more on the last page. It 'forgets' to answer a few questions (for me), like ""Why does Abel turn into an alcoholic, since nothing in life seems to bother him?"", or ""what happened to Jerry after the retaliation?"". This book makes me wanting more, considering the words are put together so beautifully,"
5,"Don't give this to a friend, to read. It's gone!","This book is hardly ever in at our 4 county library system. SoI bought the last one ... had. I made the mistake of giving it ""to read and return"" to a train buddy. Bad mistake. The variety, workmanship and excellent graphics made this a treasure. Guess I'll just have to ask my master modeler friend and fellow singer about its whereabouts. Shucks, there goes a perfectly good friendship. In estate planning there is the old, old saying: ""Once you give it away, it's gone!"""
3,okay,"not the highest quality, but the my son really wanted a robin costume & I had a hard time finding one!"
3,Postwar Intrigue,"In this TV series from the early 1950's about the aftermath of World War II in Europe, Jerome Thor and Synda Scott portray American newspaper reporters Robert Cannon and Helen Davis, who tangle with escaping war criminals, black marketeers, and burgeoning Cold War espionage. Included are four black & white episodes: ""Flea Market"", ""Diamond Bullet"", ""Sleepy Village"" and ""Hall of Justice."""
4,"cute ""Odd Couple"" romp","Cute ""Odd Couple"" comedy with Nell Carter and Dinah Manoff. When snooty Tibby Bloom (Manoff) becomes a widow and loses all her money, she has no other option than to get a job. She becomes the maid to sassy singer Jasmine Jones (Carter) whose about to make her big comeback. Complications arise when her husband shows up dead in her house...and all evidence points to Jasmine as the killer, so the girls head out on a race against time to find the real murderer!Fans of Broadway diva Nell Carter and sitcom darling Dinah Manoff (""Soap"", ""Empty Nest"") will find a lot to love about this entertaining made-for-TV comedy. And the price is pretty good too."
5,Funky Funk,"Grand Funk has always been a favorite of mine. What they lacked in their early recordings they made up for with their instinctual soul and groove. They finally hit their stride in the mid 70s and put out some great music. Why this band's body of work (along with Badfinger) continues to be shunned and not taken seriously by the powers that be never ceases to mystify me, and this collection backs up my view (can you hear me, Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame ?). Any fan of straight-forward, melodic rock'n'roll should have a copy.Highly recommended."
4,Fast-paced adventure for girls!,"When 12 year old Emma's parents have to journey to southern France so that Emma's mother can recover from consumption, Emma is crushed that she isn't allowed to accompany them. She resolves not to stay in England with her aunt and bullying cousin, and decides to sneak aboard the ship her parents are sailing on. Her adventure really begins when she realizes that she is on the wrong ship, a slave ship bound for the coast of Africa. The action continues until the very end of the book. Emma is a spunky heroine that modern-day girls will enjoy reading about!"
5,A throbbing good surf flick,"You won't find a better surf video, Bruce Irons just kills it. (but you can get it cheaper from my homies at wavejammer.com)"
1,DANIEL IN THE DINOSAUR'S DEN,"Oh, my, this is one bad movie. Martial arts hero Daniel Bernhardt is simply awful as a ""runaway"" from the future who comes back to Earth, which his people think is really ""heaven."" There he joins up with a renegade nun and some hood boys to take on dinosaur trackers and cyborgs who have come to take him back. Special effects are atrocious, the whole cast is terrible and this movie is a complete waste of time. Avoid at all costs."
5,A funny quirky movie,"The basics of this movie is just there everyone has issues, it's how you deal with them. Oh, and the accomapnying movies to the problems. OH AND APPARENTLY THE AMAZON.COM EDITORIAL REVIEWER NEVER SAW THE MOVIE BECAUSE LIV TYLERS CHARACTER IS NOT ""a lovestruck sweet thing trying to get up the nerve to express her feelings to a fellow employee"". That was infact a male character. The Liv Tyler character wants to have sex witha pop star (among other story line). Although I am simplifing the story and characters (and there are more than only the the 2 or 3 mentioned), at least I don't make them quite so plain and 2-D as the editorial reviewer, who is clearly over-paid and not doing his job."
4,Empire Rocks!,"In the Seventies director Alan Arkush tapped into teen angst with the cult fave ""Rock 'N' Roll"" High School"" featuring the Ramones characterized by high spirits and anarchy. In the Eighties John Hughes made a number of films, notably ""The Breakfast Club"", which impressed you with Hughes' ability to channel the teen zeitgeist. Director Alan Moyle draws inspiration from these films with ""Empire Records"" without being as transcendant as them. It might be a case where I'm not exactly in tune with the Generation X mentality that gives me reservations. Regardless, the movie is characterized by high energy and youthful chaos that makes it infectuous. Strap yourself into your wayback machine and enjoy the party."
5,It looped around so many times my head span.,"Have you ever seen a movie that is so bad that it's good, but then it's so bad that it loops around back to bad again, but then it is actually even worse so it makes it back to good again?If you understand what I just said, you will probably like it.Besides! It has GWAR in it!"
4,"FUNNY, ENJOYABLE,SAY NO MORE MON AMOUR","I really like this film, and it's helped me when I've gone through some hard times. Good performances and the story's funny. I love Liv Tyler, there's always something honest about her performance.By Justine Ryan"
4,"Perfect...well, not entirely perfect","So, I was flipping through the channels and stopped on VH1 when I saw a flash of Ethan Embry in that punk orange shirt. Though I hadn't seen Empire in four years, I was totally drawn in. I mean, come on, the movie is about a record store and all the quirky, hilarious things that could potentially go on in one day! You have an over-the-hill rock star album signing, a pubescent shop-lifter, a few sexual encounters, and music from every genre. I fell back into step from where I had left off, and I could basically quote the whole thing. the only thing that pisses me off is the fact that the soundtrack isn't half as good as it should be. There are so many songs that were left off, hello--Snake, Little Bastard, Romeo and Juliet, Say no more, Mon Amour?!? Anyway, overall the movie is entertaining, has great music, and no one can contradict the fact that it just lifts your spirits after you watch it. So DAMN THE MAN! SAVE THE EMPIRE!"
5,THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"this is absolutely without a doubt the best movie that i have EVER seen. Not many people know about it but those who do all agree that it is grrrrrreat.dont ""take advice from fools"" who hate good movies listen to me YOU MUST BUY EMPIRE RECORDS you will be glad you did."
2,THE FILM YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT YOU LIKED,"It was good fun. This is the film you watch when no one else is around to laugh at you. I found it a good example of corporate suits cashing in on a sub-culture, but then it's not too far off the mark sometimes, you gotta admit......the soundtrack was obviously chosen by the kids of all the writers......pretty damn diverse. The one part I loved was the subtly-placed conversation between mark & eddie at the end ( primus vs. the pixies?!?!). how cool-schmool can you get!! a good one for drinking games ( drink every time someone whines/changes the music/makes a youth culture reference), & ethan randall/embry dressed as an indie rock kid is worth the rental charges, if just for perve factor."
5,great,The movie got to my grand daughter fast and she loved the movie.She loves getting packages from Amazon.Will order again
5,Great guide for workplace - regardless of your rank,"Wow-what a guide! How much more effective an employee, coworker, and supervisor I would have been in the past years had I had this manual at my side. The conversational delivery is so comfortable, and it helped me discover the places where I have been ineffectual, especially in communication complex issues. Thanks for putting into writing what so many of us need to know to be more effective in the workplace."
3,as expected,"it was a bumper sticker for a car, but i'm a mechanic, so i put on my tool box along with other stickers. how do you write a 20 word review for a bumper??"
3,"Hello, kids","This is one of the best Finnish bands ever (did I hear you laughing?). It ain't much, I know, but if you don't like Britney Spears or Korn you should check this out."
3,graphing calc.,"I only gave a satisfactory review because the product did not work when it got to me. It did however arrive on time, but still was of no use when I got it. I have ordered things from them before and this is my first bad experience."
5,WORKS THE BEST ~ FRAGRANCE FREE !!!,"Has 5% sulphur instead of the usual 3% sulphur of most acne/sulphur soaps on the market. No oils to clog the pores, and no fragrances to irritate the skin. Works better than anything else I've tried. Finally, someone has made a soap with high quality ingredients.Inactive ingredients: Aloe vera leaf, chamomile (Matricaria recutita) flower extract 5:1, fo-ti (Polygonum multiflorum) root extract 5:1, vegetable glycerin, glycyrrhetinic acid, hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) berry extract 5:1, pentasodium pentetate, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) leaf extract 5:1, sage (Salvia officinalis) aerial part extract 5:1, sodium chloride, sodium cocoate, sodium palm kernalate, sodium palmate, tetrasodium etidronate, titanium dioxide color, and water."
1,Very Poorly Written,"It is ironic that this movie should pertain to the subject of writing, as it is very poorly written.A MICROCOSM of this can be seen at the end, where the author reads his supposedly ""breakthrough"" novel: anybody over an amateur level readily recognizes what he is reading as extremely poor, extremely amateurish writing. It is also interesting that John Grisham is referred to once in the movie as a paragon of good writing--as though ""fast food"" writing ever qualified as very good intellectual reading meat.The stupidity of the protagonist in not procuring a contract for his services strains credulity.The likelihood that a well-known author would acquiesce to co-author his last book strains credulity.The very stilted dialogue of this movie strains credulity.Mick Jagger did a great job acting, but it's not enough to save this stinker.The guy who wrote this movie neither understands good writing nor was capable of it."
3,This band would sound great performing live,"All in all, ""Deluxe Edition"" is a fun CD that has some great passages in songs such as when Saturn, Lima, and Isle Of Langerhan. When the band gets down to business, they play a tight, well-meshed vibe that is great for driving or blaring through outdoor speakers at home---clearly, this band would sound great performing live.But sometimes things go a bit awry when the chorus keeps repeating and repeating and repeating. Also, the crash and burn ending of UFO is not very pleasant, and I'm not so glad about this rather dreary remake of I'm So Glad. Grandma sounds like a bunch of similar songs.Still, this CD has its place and its moments."
5,Great overview of the Presidents!,Got this for my 8 year old daughter who has been very intested in Presidents since the elecetion. She loved it and my husband & I are enjoying reading it too!
4,A neat way to learn,"My son, who is almost two years old, loves these things. We collected our deck from a Chick-fil-a promotion. One day he became interested in them. He pointed to each president and I told him the name. Soon he was bringing them to me at night to go through them at bedtime. Now he knows all of them! Of course, he'll probably forget them as time goes on, but it's been neat to see his mind work. I wish they were a bit sturdier, but nothing paper really lasts with a two year old. At least I know I can order another set if I have to.I've found them pretty interesting as well. My only (minor) complaint is that I'd prefer the president's bios to have more facts and real detail. Some of them have vague, meaningless sentences in the descriptions such as ""He always tried to do what was best for his country."""
1,Not worth the time.,"The Richard Boone movie is third rate. It seems that at the end of his career, Boone took on some badly scripted and plotted movies. ""Crooked Sky"" is one of them. Another is ""Madron"".The documentary ""Indian Wars"" was poorly done. The audio documentary does not jive with the video, which were mostly taken from stock footage of old cavalry movies.Lon Chaney Jr. in ""Battles of Chief Pontiac"" is not the typical B western fare. Not only is it bad, its worse. The print however is much better than the others available in public domain products.The color and sound in the Dale Robertson's movie, ""Sitting Bull"" with J. Caroll Naish in the title role are atrocious. It's typical 50's western fare. It was filmed in cinemascope and a restored or a better preserved version would have been enjoyable to watch. Since this was not produced by the big studios, I doubt if a better copy will ever crop up.I made a mistake in buying this product. I don't recommend it."
3,Don't Play it,This game got pretty boring really quick and with mac it always made my computer start to overheat when i used it. I won't buy any more games for my mac.
1,"Unless you have a BRAND NEW G5, DO NOT BUY!!!","Seriously! I thought I'd sneak by with my machine. I mean, come on! I can handle a game that runs a little slower. Well, you can't play the game when the control panel in the game flickers in and out, because you don't have the hardware to support it.People! Listen to the ACTUAL Mac users that bought this software, not the kids that played SIMS 2 on their PC. Don't even risk buying this if you have the ""minimum"" recommended requirements. SERIOUSLY! It DOESN'T WORK!"
2,Simple Sim...,"It's okay... This was my first Sims purchase -- I take that back! This was my 2nd Sims purchase; I HAD to buy it because I purchased another Sims product that wouldn't work without having this one installed first! After installing this one and then installing the 2nd one, I'm unable to use this one... It's like the 2nd one wrote over the 1st one. I assumed that having both installed, I'd have access to both (?)...."
1,sims 2,I cannot get it to work on my MAC BOOK PRO. I plan to reload it but I am very disappointed. I also purchased SIMS3 but I really don'ts like it.
3,READ THIS WARNING FIRST...,"i'm sure it's a fantastic game (i gave it three stars because i can't vouch for either extreme), but double and triple check the system requirements before you buy this game. i THOUGHT i checked everything, but the processor speed on older G4 powerbooks isn't as high as newer ones, so it doesn't run on my machine... oh well."
1,Make sure you have the machine to play this!,"I haven't rated this game correctly because I cannot play it on my computer. I very recently (we're talking less than a month ago) bought the new iBook G4 laptop for $1,300 straight off the Apple website, and was excited to have this game coming to me. Well, as it turns out, the new iBooks don't have the right video card to play this. So...not sure whether to mail the game back to Amazon and get the regular Sims game or what. All I'm saying is, if you have an iBook like mine, beware."
4,PRETTY GOOD,"The book spend alot of time with examples, which isnt bad, but if you are looking for a primer on the law, tax advantages, pro's and con's, I found googling just as effective without the hefty price tag, at $5-10 this book is great value, at $30+ retail, well..."
2,Too basic and repetitive,"I had high hopes for this book but it did not meet my expectations. The book does a decent job explaining the difference between an LLC and other entities like C corp, S corp, general partnerships, etc. However, it does not get to the point about (1) steps needed to file an LLC and the common paradigm of filing in Nevada / Delaware and then registering in your home state, (2) choosing where to file for LLC, or (3) ongoing legal and financial care and feeding of the LLC so you do not ""pierce the corporate veil."" Basically, the book is very light on specifics and does not justify its price. I am returning it, hoping to find a more thorough guide."
1,Very Deceptive Product Description,"As another reviewer pointed out, this product listing is for a single piece of Code 83 Super-Flex track yet the description contains ""(100)"" in the description which might lead you to believe you are getting 100 pieces (not realistic for this price). The vendor compares this Code 83 track to Code 100 track, but there is no logical reason to include the misleading ""(100)"" in the product title. The description needs to be edited to accurately represent the product. Great Atlas product, but I'll be buying my flex track from an Amazon vendor who pays more attention to honest and accurate product descriptions."
3,Very Confusing!!,"I have been dancing for 6 years now so nothing in this video is foreign to me, but it is an INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING choreography to learn because she teaches it part of the time facing you (so you are supposed to mirror her which is difficult) and then she turns around so you can't really see what she's doing. If you are a beginner, this will be exceptionally frustrating for you to follow. My advice to her is next time, do your teaching in front of a mirror like Jillina does in her instructional dvd's it will make for MUCH EASIER translation of the movements to your student. I've worked it several times and have ended up frustrated every time, don't know if I will pursue it to the end. On the upside, I could listen to that music for days!!"
3,Too Big And Heavy!,"Although this set contains everything one could ask for in terms of dominoe games, the whole set winds up to be immensely heavy and impractical. Unless one has a designated game table to place this humongouse set upon, it's way to big and heavy to be hauling in and out of a cabinet, and far too heavy for youngsters to carry comfortably - or safely!I ended up returning my set."
2,Book Club - a cheaply bound book,"While this book has wonderful information and assessment sheets that could be copied and used, this $25.00 paperback started to fall apart by the sixth week of school. It was one of four texts we were working with, so it wasn't from overuse, and there were eight to ten other people in the class experiencing the same thing. The publisher ought to be ashamed of themselves. A book like this is meant to be used often as a reference for a classroom teacher. Instead it's useless because it's falling apart. Shame on you all."
5,Love this book!,"This has been a family favorite, sent it to my Godson after reading him our worn out copy on a sleepover... a big hit!"
2,too small,"I thought this book would be good for my classroom,however; it was too small for the children to see as a group. This book is better suited for one on one reading."
3,Johnny Mathis Live in Las Vegas,I couldn't find any place to ask the seller what the names of the tracks are on this. I don't understand how they can think we would just buy it without knowing it's contents. I like everything Johnny Mathis sings and I was wondering if the track And Her Mother Came Too is on this. I also want to know the titles of the rest of the tracks. Thanks.
5,A Great Buy,Recently purchased to replace multiple unit system w/ Bose Speakers. The sound from this system is the same as the more expensive Bose system. Easy to use and install. A great buy for the money
2,Don't bother,"This might be an ok book for your first try at Swedish Weaving or Huck Embroidry, but it gets awfully boring after that. All of the Swedish Weave books by these authors have very similar patterns - any one of them is more than enough.A better choice for a first book might be ASN's Monk's Cloth Diamond Afghans, which offers a choice of traditional designs and somewhat clearer how-to instructions. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is.A much better choice for a second book would be ""Huck Adventures"" by Michiko Kuge with easy to follow instructions, more interesting designs and mouth watering colors. These designs show how far from boring a rather limited technique can be! Another good choice for a second book would be ""Plain and Fancy Huck Embroidery"" by Bonnie Datta. This is a slim booklet but has more interesting and original material in it than all four of the Tams/Duffin books combined. The graphs are also very easy to follow. The only drawback is that it may be difficult to find."
2,Too Simplistic,The writing style of this book was geared to a 13 or 14 year old girl. I stuck with it hoping things would evolve. They never did.
2,Not one of Judith Mcnaught's best.,"I was looking forward to this book, until I read it. Judith McNaught is one of my favorite writers, but I was very disappointed in her most recent effort. This book seemed to be more like a debut novel instead of one from a well written author. The story line and plot were good, but the developement of characters was slow and never really brought forth. It was no where in the line with Paradise, my favorite contempory novel by her, or Whitney My Love, McNaught's best historical novel. I only hope McNaught doesn't try to go the same route as Sandra Brown and try to write mystery. Brown bombed at it. I hope McNaught has better judgement, and realizes what a great romance novelist she is. They should both stick to what they know. I almost didn't finish this book, which is something I've never done. Anything I start, I always finish. I still wait with high anticipation for McNaught's next novel."
2,I don't get it!,"I have read all of Judith McNaughts books, and I have to say this has got to be the worst one. Usually there is a big build up and anticipation of the two lovers getting together. That is missing here. All of the characters are underdeveloped and I didn't really get why Sloan was so attracted to Noah, and the story of Paris and Paul is never gone into in detail so how did their relationship develop? To me Noah's sister Courtney is more interesting than most of the major characters. I hope in the future Judith McNaught returns to her old writing style. I'm sure some of the characters from this book will be the focus of other books, so lets hope their stories are more interesting than Sloan and Noah's! But if it's a quick read you're after this one is it."
3,Not one of her bests!,I love her books and I enjoyed this one also. However it did not hook me in as much as some of other other books. Sloan is not believable as a police woman. The plot seemed disconnected. Noah has his moments but the book did not get a chance to develop his character as much.
3,Interesting plotline,"Unfortunately, I read ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" first, and it was so good that ""Night Whispers"" suffered by comparison.The story and characters were very good if somewhat unrealistic. The Maitland family came across as more believable than the others. However, there's romance, suspense, betrayal and murder, good dialogue and interesting settings, so the book is an enjoyable read."
3,Not okay,"I'm a devoted fan of Judith McNaught and in fact have read and bought all her books. Sad to say that this one left me out in the cold. Sure its refreshing that she wrote a novel which delved more on solving mysteries rather than on romance... but she was identified with romance books such as A Kingdom of Dreams and I find it hard to identify her with anything else. The plot though it seems great was predictable. I was surprised to see Sloan's mom and Noah's dad ending up together in the end since there's no indication that they'll end up together. A lot of scenes doesn't concern that of the hero and heroine's love for each other since suspicion is the main player of the novel. If your a devoted fan, read it. If you haven't read any of her novels yet I suggest that you skip this one and read her previous novels."
4,Metamorphosis,"Nice panels. Will have to use a bit of creativity to find a frame for it, but definitely a very nice piece."
4,"""Vicious Man""","Ilove the book because it keeps me guessing, and exited in my warm bed,and I want to know what'll happen next.I like the characters, Mike, Shy, Bobby, and Pam besides Mike is a vicious man at the same time he's a diplomatic man as well. I was impressed by the way he handled his business, and his girl friend's business matters.I also like the way he treats his mother, and how his life ends up made me go hmmmmmm."
5,IS IT A CRIME,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME.IF YOU WANT TO READ A BOOK ABOUT, LOVE, MYSTERY AND DRAMA ALL IN ONE, WELL THIS IS THE BOOK."
2,SO NOT THE DRAMA,"OKAY, WELL THIS IS MY FIRST NOVEL BY ROY, THAT I READ, AND I WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED, HIS STORYLINE WAS GARBAGE, AND TYPICAL, BUT OVERALL IT WAS UNREALISTIC. I THINK THAT HE COULD'VE DONE A MUCH BETTER JOB. IT SEEMS LIKE HIS BOOK WAS BASED ON OTHER BOOKS AND MOVIES THAT HE'S SEEN IN THE PAST AND FROM THAT HE DECIDED TO WRITE A NOVEL THAT HE THOUGHT SUMED IT ALL UP. BUT IT DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE. THE ROMANCE IN THIS NOVEL WAS SO FAIRY TALE LIKE, AND NOT SOMETHING THAT I COULD IMAGINE WOULD HAPPEN IN ACTUALITY"
2,Very out-dated,"I found the story line to be very dated. The characters come straight from the author watching alot of B movies, or reading alot of gansters novels. The story has no surprises, it follows a formula that has been done over and over.The novel is in need of editing in the worse way."
4,"The Late, Great Claude Cahun","I love the book. My only wish is that the pictures were larger. For an art book, we only get thumbnail pics. Sadly, no up-close details."
5,Billy Idol Rebel Yell,"The ultimate rock star never disappoints!! Of course, a must have for any Idol library or for anyone who enjoys rock n roll with sex appeal!"
5,A Good Cd Gets Even Better,"""Rebel Yell"" is one of those rare CD's that is just slammin' from start to finish. The original CD featured only 9 songs but this remastered 1999 version includes 5 bonus songs. To me the remastered tracks sound better than the ones on my original CD and it's always good to have bonus material. Besides the radio hits songs like ""Blue Highway,"" ""Daytime Drama,"" and ""Crank Call"" still rock today. This is a timeless CD and a must have for Billy Idol fans."
4,One of my favourites,"I have two Robert Gellis' novels, Gilliane is the best, it evokes emotion. I had originally lent a copy of this novel to a friend, who then lost it, I thought it was such a good book, I had to track down another copy to put back on my shelves. A fabulous read."
2,book,very disappointed with the book..I would not recommend it because it is not very well written and exaggerated! the perfect American family in Europe?????????
4,Worth Buying,"I'm a great Micheal Buble fan since he has such great voice quality, can sing spot on pitch, and his style of basically easy listening suits me fine. I do agree with some other reviewers that he tends to lisp on some of the selections--that's a little distracting. The mix of selections is very good--I just don't care for ""That's Life"" with its gospel-sounding background. That arrangement ruins that particular song for me. All in all, this is a great CD to get."
2,What is with the lisping?,"I love Michael Buble's singing. But I have to say, something is up with his voice. Am I the only one out there who hears him lisping his way through this album? It is like he is singing with someone holding onto the tip of his tongue. Or maybe he got his tongue pierced. I don't know, but all the lisping is distracting from what would otherwise be a fabulous project. It ruined it for me."
3,Not bad.,"Some of the songs are good but overall it's a yawner. His past CD's have been better. If you're a big fan,as I am, it's worth getting for the few good titles, but if it's your first CD of his,opt for one of the past releases."
1,I can't get past the lisp,"I love Michael Buble. Love him. But I can't listen to this album. The arrangements are good, the song choices are good, but he lisps throughout it and it drives me nuts. I don't hear him doing this on any other album, so what gives? Just a bad day in the studio I guess. Try something else, he is good otherwise."
4,Good buble cd,Got this cd for my uncle also. He was very happy and listens to it often. Real cd's have better quality sound than mp3's because each song is about 10 times larger file wav. vs mp3. My uncle recommends this cd.
4,MICHAEL BUBLE AT HIS BEST,"Michael is an amazing talent. I saw him 2 years ago, and could not believe how magical his performance was. I think my favorite song on this CD is ""Me and Mrs. Jones"", and my second favorite is ""That's Life"". Michael is definitely the new Frank Sinatra. Buy it. You'll love it."
2,I hear a lisp in his singing,"I enjoy MB when I have heard him on the radio, and I really enjoyed his singing ""Call Me Irrespondible"" when I saw him on American Idol. Therefore, I was so looking forward to buying this album. I purchased it and started to play it in my car immediately. However, what did I hear in the first line of the 1st song.....a terrible distracting lisp!!! It got worst thru' next few songs on the CD. I loved the ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" arrangement but that awful distracting lisp kept rearing its ugly head. Did I get a defective CD?"
2,Does he have a speech impediment or is it just me?,"Doesn't anyone notice he has a speech impediment? He slurs some words and has a very pronounced lisp at times. I'm not making fun of the handicapped. If he was someone that I met on the street I wouldn't mention it, but he has chosen a profession that requires clear speech and should be held to higher standards. If he was my dentist, I would be good with it.The songs where there are fewer instances of ""s"" or ""th"" etc. are fantastic, but songs like ""World On A String"" are reminiscent of William Hung. I really like ""Me And Mrs. Jones"", but I can still hear a slight lisp here and there. I don't think I remember hearing the slurring and lisping on previous recordings??? I agree with a previous reviewer that asked how the studio could put this CD out."
5,did u convert 2?,"even if you weren't into his type of music before i bet you will be after you listen to this cd.this was the first cd that i bought of Michael's and i LOVE IT! it's like having a modern day Sinatra singing.he can just melt your heart with most of the songs on this cd, by far my favorite though is Everything...you just wish it was you that inspired that song.if you haven't listened to it yet..check it out...and buy the cd you Won't regret it...i didn't!!"
5,Michael being Michael,"This is a must have CD if you even think you might like Michael Buble. While the music is still in the same gendre, it offers a new variety of songs for Michael to master."
5,In love!,"This CD will bring you a lifetime of joy. A true masterpiece, it has every sound for every mood. I declare MB one our music Gods. Way to go MB! Love you!!!"
1,Not fond of...,"A friend let me listen to this CD -- Unfortunately, this MB CD and previous ones just don't cut it for me. Just thankful I've never had to purchase one of his CD's. Much prefer Harry Connick Jr and even at times, Sinatra over MB's voice. His so-called charm doesn't appear charmful to me. I've tried to enjoy his music, but I'm afraid with every CD friend has insisted I listen to, just makes me wonder why there seems to be no change in type of songs sung."
3,Run-on sentences make the book unnecessarily dull.,"I learned quite a bit from this book and do not criticize its content. (Other reviewers have covered that.) However, I feel that it is unnecessarily dull because the writing is at times tiresome.Here (from page 100) is a typical example: ""His ability to solidify the place of the new and threatening entity in a European system shattered by its emergence and to create a new international order in which Germany could live in peace and prosper may have been even more remarkable."" (What?) That was forty-two words, count 'em.And I don't mean to sound like Mr. Red-pen, but inadequate punctuation sometimes worsens the confusion. I often went ""Huh?"" and re-read a sentence because I was lost by the time I got to its end."
3,Basic Intro to the horse business,"This book was easy to read and had some useful information. It gave a basic overview of what different horse businesses entail. It covers too many topics to go into much depth, but a good book for someone who would like a general introduction to the horse industry."
4,Book For Those Wanting to Start a Boarding or Lesson Barn,"This is an excellent reference for those interested in starting a boarding and/or lesson stable. Lots of promotional advice, which though overlooked by many horse people, is an intregal part of having a successful business. I only gave the book four stars because I felt the title was a little misleading in that it would be more appropriately titled ""Stable"" instead of ""Business"" since the book is geared for a boarding/lesson operation."
3,Decent Movie,This movie was ok. Seem like this plot has been done too many times.Still worth watching if you have 1.5 hours to kill.
4,Embryo - 'Life' (Disconforme),"As I've heard {and, or} own several other releases by the long-running German progressive / krautrock band Embryo - like 'Opal', 'Steig', 'Rocksessions', 'Bremen 1971' (my personal favorite) and 'Embryonnck - No Neck', I have to say that 'Life' does hold it's own as - much as I had expected. The four tracks here are from several live performances from 1979-80. They are as follows: ""Cello Cello"" (15:26), the traditional composition ""Telisirama"" (7:25), ""Talatarangini"" (14:46) and the awesome-sounding ""Marokkanische"" (11:21) - Gong fans will simply love this tune. Check it out."
4,My husband and I liked these condoms. They ...,"My husband and I liked these condoms. They were very natural feeling and didn't inhibit our pleasure. Although neither of us is sensitive to latex, one of the nice features of this product is that's safe for those with latex sensitivity. We'd definitely buy this product again."
3,Voyage,This was a very hard game for me to play. There were lots of things to mix and fix. The saving and resume play was very smooth. The cutsie people on the menu really got old to watch. I could only find one walkthrough and it was very difficult to follow. I would get in one place (you had to hop from one place to another over and over again) and need something from another place. I had to quit several times because it got very tedious to play.
5,Another Excellent Must Have by Tiny Tot Sports,"My toddlers can not get enough of this video and the entire series by Tiny Tot Sports. It is a fun educational experience without being instructional. As a coach I recognize the need for toddlers to explore on their own and not be instructed on their attempts to shoot, pass, and dribble. They will learn from watching other toddlers dribble and shoot sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully. Again, as a coach this video gets 5 star vote!!"
1,Was not what I thought it was... I wouldn't recommend it unless you like 2 player games,"I thought this was going to make the card game 3-4 players, but it did not. This expansion only expanded the 2 player game with more options, which it already has plenty. I am going to return this."
1,Doesn't accomplish what it wishes it could,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is supposed to be a look at the sex industry in Nashville, but fails to create interesting characters or situations and falls for cliche after cliche. If we cared about the protaganist the story might mean something, but since we don't, the story ends up being hollow and shallow. Save yourself the effort and don't read this one."
3,A little effort would make this better...,"The movies are decent quality, and fine for wasting an afternoon. None of them are really stand out classics though.My main complaint about this DVD is the false advertising on the case. Not malicious, but obviously the company put no effort at all into this product. The case lists the 1938 Tex Ritter classic ""Utah Trails"" including its complete cast and summary. Unfortunately the movie on the disc is the 1945 Roy Rogers movie ""Utah"" which is unrelated. There are other similiar mistakes as well.It isn't enough to condemn this DVD, but it shows the sort of effort that this company puts into these releases."
2,Steam Machine Runs Out of Gas,"This movie is neither unique or good. In fact, what makes this flick so memorable is the lovely and sexed-up Joan Van Ark. Van Ark plays a radio psychologist whose parents were murdered when she was a young child. Now it seems the killer is after her. In order to protect herself and her young daughter, Van Ark turns to a cop, and the two have one of the steamiest love scenes in recent memory. Credit the director Nathanial Gutman for not sullying the scene with corny music . Instead, the scene is silent, with the exception of panting and moaning (Van Ark even grits her teeth at one point! ) This scene does make the movie wothwhile, but the hackneyed ending- complete with a did-you-see-it-coming? would-be plot twist, destroys all credibility whatsoever. Kudos to Van Ark, though. Forget Pam or Carmen or Jenny- for two hours, she's the sexiest woman on TV."
1,Wasted Joan,"I love Joan Van Ark as I love all of the former Knots Landing ladies, but this film was really awful and unworthy of her talents. The story becomes increasingly implausible as it progresses to its stupid finale. I hate suspense films that revolve around female protagonists being stupid, and this sadly is one of them."
2,"Engaging Story, Annoying Primary Character","Like other reviewers, I thought the dog training tips were interesting...but thought there were just too many inserted at times that didn't really further the plot.The main character, Jack Field, was a bit too annoying for me to give the book more than two stars. Just my opinion, but he seemed too smug and too clever for his own good. He had an answer for everything, and there seemed to be no limit to his abilities. Frankly, it was difficult to relate to or care about the character.Hopefully later installments in the series will have toned that smug perfection down a bit. I am truly on the fence (bad dog!) about whether to try any other books, though."
1,Send to the Goodwill or Trash?,"This has to be one of the worst books I have read and wasted money on in a long time. I found the story to be dull and juvenile in it's writing style.I find it hard to believe that this person claims to be a dog trainer.Now, my quandary is should it go to the Goodwill or the trash? I think the trash."
4,Review by a non-dreamy person,"As far as quality of writing, this book is simple and easy to read. The writing is clear and descriptive. The stories about the author's life are vibrant and real. They bring a richness to the book and help the reader relate to what is going on with their own life. As far as dreams go, the interrpretations are very authentic and the author truly knows her stuff. Although the jacket cover may not catch your eye, the inside of the book is what counts and I think if you are a spritual seeking type of person you will enjoy this book!"
5,NIJITA 2,The second season was more exciting than the first and to see how she takes on all villians wow wouldn't want to meet her in a dark alley...Everyweek it was another action packed story..Can't wait to see season three when she takes over the office
1,So factually inaccurate,"Wow. This episode was so wrong its just sad. I had a really hard time watching this episode because of all of the things they got wrong.1. Maxwell AFB is in Alabama not North Dakota. I know because that's were my paychecks come from, and where I did my training.2. Shooting a propane tank does not make it explode. Watch the Mythbusters episode about that.3. Project Starwars was shut down because the Geneva Convention made it illegal to weaponize space. It was never officially tested. Look it up, it's declassified.4. Blowing up a Nuclear reactor does not create a nuclear explosion. There is not enough U235 isotope to react with an explosive. Nuclear bomb=100% U235, Nuclear Reactor 2% U235. Do some research on the subject and you will see I'm right.This episode had so many things wrong it was almost like the writers were just pulling things out of their head and didn't look anything up."
5,Maggie Q and other actors keep action moving!,"I've enjoyed this series immensely. There's always twists and turns that keep it edgy. I wouldn't suggest it for the very young, partly due to adult content, violence and gadgetry that is over their heads."
4,The non-diet diet,This book was just what I was looking for.I needed to clean up my nutrition againand this is a sound plan.
3,the paleo diet for athletes,"Well what can I say about the paleo diets, somehow they include foods that were not around 200 years ago to most people. Macadamia nut and oil, not for everyone in the world and certainly not for europeans. Coconut oil is another example- limited to tropical island cultures. Originally when I read the authors first book- i just put the book away- canola oil not recommeded now- cultures far back whould have been eating animal fats and organ meats with the muscle meat- periodgood athlete recommendations though- especially about not over training and eating enough calories"
1,NOT Made in USA,"I bought this because it said in the product description that it was ""Made in USA."" When I opened the package, it clearly had a large sticker on the side that said ""Made in China.""It was a Christmas gift for my parents."
5,Racer/Shooter,This game is best of both worlds. Racing and Shooting. It has all the features of GT and NFS but it also brings in the heavy weapons to make the race even better. Great Game
2,Decent Game,"The graphics a pretty nice. The game play is average; the driving and steering are too easy however. Unless you are brand new to racers I would suggest Burnout Revenge, or Flat Out Ultimate Carnage. The game was o.k., but I was not too impressed."
4,Brings back memories and fun to play!,"The board is an updated version of the original but basically the same game. Mine arrived with some slight damage because the cue sticks were packaged inside the playing surface. The cue sticks knocked the little wood walls out of place-About 7 walls needed to be glued back in place so we could play. We bought small nails to permanently secure the walls of each hole. The walls are barely secured to the table with teeny tiny metal pins that barely stick into the game board. An easy fix with new nails. A few tee boxes are incorrectly labeled: there is the number and a ""th"" !!! So the 1st tee is labeled 1th, 2nd is labeled 2th, etc. The box states ""Made in China"".Set aside the little annoyances and you have a fun board game. It's a great buy. And it was a better deal than the ""Strokes"" Carrom table game. I have posted quite a few photos of the game board and packaging."
1,Big fiasco,"Simply awful, I thought I was getting a hit compilation by the original artists and it turned out to be some amateur group covering the songs and they can't do it, the music sounds like a joke. If you are looking for a compilation by original artists, we'll have to wait for a while! Note: The 1 star was given since it woldn't let me finalize this if I left the field empty, but really it's a 0."
2,Did not receive items as shown in picture,"I did receive my package very quickly but was dissappointed when I opened the package and did not receive all that was pictured. The picture shows a full sized tripod along with a table top tripod, I did not get the full size, not a big deal as I already have a full size triopod, it also shows a 9-1 media card reader that I did not receive, a carry case that I did not receive, a 256mb XD Card that I did not receive,and rechargeable batteries with charger that I did not receive. I will be contacting the seller to see if this was perhaps an oversight or is the picture misleading. I am happy with the other items that I did receive as they came quickly and well packaged."
4,Maximize your cupboard space!!!,Works great to add extra space in my crowded kitchen! Be sure to check the measurments closely to insure it will fit in your cupboard and your dishes will fit.Sturdy product.
4,Hillary's Scheme Leaves the Left With Nothing to Say,"This is an excellent and well researched book outlining more of Hillary's outrageous behavior. Reviews attacking this book are obviously presented by people who haven't read it and have no real ammunition to fire back. The paranoid ""Right Wing Conspiracy"" rantings that the left has used to dismiss the illegal and unethical behavior of the Clinton Dynasty are put to bed by the carefully laid out facts about Hillary Clinton. If you want to read a fluff piece full of distortions, read Hillary's book. If you want the truth, read this one. Highly recommended."
4,A Must Read,"When Hillary runs for President, all voters should read this book. Mr. Limbacher backs up his facts with named sources, many of which I have heard and read from those quoted sources. Sen. Clinton and her entourage are experts at finding and slinging the dirt, true or skewed, at their opponents, but she always seems to have a convenient case of amnesia when questioned about herself. The mainstream media, the majority of which admit to their left-leaning beliefs, have covered and glossed over eight years of Clinton co-presidency (more counting the Arkansas governor reign) of doublespeak and evasions. Mr. Limbacher goes right to the heart of how putting Sen. Clinton into the highest office in the land is a well-planned, long term goal. Now that's very scary -- a socialist-leaning, redistribute the wealth, tempermental, scheming president!"
1,So she wants to be President. ??,"I haven't read the book. I'm pretty confident that it's dedicated mostly to making a mountain out of several alleged mole-hills. So I'm a communist monster, dupe, etc. Read this anyway. You'll find it amusing.I'm just writing to mention to all you zealots out there that wanting to be President is a legitimate, common tendency among government officials of every stripe.I dare say your diety Mr. Bush at one point wanted to become president. His will-to-power however is the most common of human traits. This isn't one of his flaws. Don't pretend it's one for Hillary.Her largest flaw is that she disagrees with you. It makes your skin crawl. Even if she's misguided and wrong, is this so evil?I have to ask - is she really important enough to obsess over after three years out-of-office?Perhaps you should find some other, new people to focus your carefully cultivated loathing and anger upon - and maybe get real lives?"
1,Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda,"I can't wait until Hillary becomes President and the author of this book and his fellow idiots can impeach her for the 87 mysterious murders of people they met, by her and her husband!"
2,Legends & Myths slow reading,"While I love Hawaii and its histoy, I found this book to be on the boring side. Too many dates and names so closely related, that it was difficult to keep them all straight. I was expecting a book that was light and easy to read, but its not what this book is. If you are looking for a ton of detail, then this is for you."
3,a little short of expectations but ok i guess,I bought a new season 1 set that is supposed to come with a lot of little neat extras. there were no extras and the dvd cases were broken allowing the dvds slide around in the cases. the dvds themselves work fine but the total package wasn't as high a quality as i expected.
3,It plays in 720P and 1080P,The 2nd disc containing the Window HD content is the only way to go on an HDTV. I played it from my laptop with HDMI out directly to my big screen TV (1080P) and the picture was very very sharp. The menu gives you a choice of playing in 720P or 1080P format. The movie itself is decent.
2,Over priced and not very good,"I received a black rack though the colour is supposed to be silver/metal. It has only one screw (as in the photo) so it's swung over to one side. it ought to have two screws. It's pretty narrow for 2 bikes. You have to have the 2 facing opposite directions and turn the handle bars to get them to hang. I expected the rack to fold up, out of the way, when the bikes are removed -- no such luck -- and if I want them held up I'll need to tie them.This is worth $12 no more."
3,Not bad....,"Pretty basic design, got two bikes on there with no trouble, however if there are training wheels on the bike don't bother trying to put it up there, better off just buying the hooks at Walmart. Also if you have an alternative wall surface other than wood stud walls, or drywall. Go to the store and get you some plastic anchors w/screws. I have brick, and had to run to the store and spend .45 cents on fasteners for my hangers. Overall, I'm satisfied, and would recommend this for anyone."
3,Scarey but works,"I was a little scared to buy this after the mixed reviews, and my OCD forced me to check its fit a few times because I didn't want to wake to the sound of braking glass any my car alarm. It does stay up very well and with a little manuvering we were able to fit two bikes. One was even a weird cheap girls bike with goofy springs and everything. It is tricky though to get them on and off so for more than one bike I would just use it for long term storage."
3,Misses a part of Boston I need,"Not very good for the Northeastern University area of Boston. The detail map ends on the north end of campus. It is probably fine as a tourist map, which no doubt is its intention."
3,Definitely a downtown map,"I had seen the other reviews that mentioned this was a downtown *only* map but I was thinking the it would give a little bit more information than just the financial district, Bank Bay, and North ends - it doesn't.It's a good size to carry when you are walking the Freedom Trail or just looking to figure out where you are if you get ""lost"".And the lamination is sturdy... so don't worry about the rain and drizzle with this one! :-)"
2,A book for IWW fans,If you are a Wobbly or an IWW fan you will find this book interesting from a fellow who's been there. If you're not familiar with the IWW you probably won't get the inside jokes the writer is writing about.
4,"Great For Movies, Videos and Bad Weather","These are great treats that I wish Amazon.com carried as part of its regular stock. These are essentially wax bottles of flavored sweets in them that vanish quickly when you're doing mindless work. Just bite off bits and chew them until the liquid is gone, then spit out the wax. They taste great and nice treats for kids as well. Summer candy they ain't, and the wax can melt unless shipped with an ice pack. The downside is the shipping price."
3,Convenient,Product is very convenient and compact. They work great. The test will be how long they last and how long they keep retracting.
5,Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-USB,I bought the Hauppauge-WinTV-PVR-USB to use on the wife's laptop. Her laptop had the windows XP multa-media software and I thought that would be a good accessory. The software loaded OK but it took awhile to get the remote control to work. Windows problem not Hauppauge. The computer is used when we travel in our RV. On a recent trip I programmed the local cable channels and it took the guesswork out of finding the programs I wanted to watch. It made the computer into a additional TV and VCR as well. I have bought several Hauppauge products and this is the hi quality I expected from them. The only negative is that it doesn't include digital channels. I had to buy a HVR 950 for the HDTV channels. I see they now have a HVR 1600 which may be better for analog and digital.
3,Disappointed - couldnt get color picture to come in,"install doc ok. rest of doc for older versions and not for versions installed. Had problems getting color picture. Worked great but everything came in black and white. Scheduler worked ok for recording and recording works fine. Integration with MS Media Center is minamal. It doesnt work with Movie Maker but TV is setup thru Media Center software. I have a cable DVR and was going to us this mostly to save recorded programs from DVR to DVD and later maybe replace the cable DVR with this program. I also was going to use this to copy some of my VCR tapes to DVD. Another problem, I did not find documentation to use camcorder/vcr or other devices for input. I did figure it out but its not documented. Am returning this product since their support cannot resolve the black and white only picture."
3,Another good one from this band,"With this i already own their 4 lps/cds. Now they have to issue that fantastic album 'Solar Plexus' by Solar Plexus group whichinvolved Made in Sweden's guitar player and composer (afer the first 3 Made in Sweden albums) which is a spectacular album. This is probably their weakest as some USA funk fusion is definitely creeping in and leaving behind their folk/pop/psychedelic sound a bit (which is the reason i liked them in the first place). But, still, a couple of memorable songs, three instrumentals which show off the talents of Pohjola (who offers the best instrumental-a 10 minute tour de force in his particular style of composing), Wadenius and last but not least the forgotten great key player Gulgowsky. The singer is quite good but i miss their previous one. Anyways, a good one for sure but leave it for last after you get their other 3."
3,Entertaining for the first viewing...dull afterwards...,"I bought this item to see her videos, because I never saw any of her older ones. When I first watched the tape, it was cool. But after playing the tape for like the third time, the videos become dull.I like the video for ""Passionate Kisses"" as it has a lot of scenes from around Washington, D.C. and the quick takes keep you interested in watching it.I think that you should probably buy this only if you have a MCC collection of some sort. The ordinary MCC fan probably has seen the videos already and wouldn't need to buy this. It just becomes dull after a few viewings, even if you're trying to just see the ones you like."
1,Uncomfortable merchandise,"My husband and I are very disappointed with this item. It is very uncomfortable to wear, not the size we expected or the color green. We want to return this item. How do we go about it?"
4,A gem too!,"This compilation cd is a gem too. Just like its counterpart Bachatahits 2005 this cd reassures merengue fans that merengue is still a force to be reckoned with. I was not sure what to expect since merengue has slowed down somewhat over the past few years but this cd reunites the best of the best of 2004 for 2005 all in one cd. The cd has a nice variety of merengue golpeito, suave and tipico. You will enjoy it. No doubt about it."
5,One of the best movies that I have seen in ages,"Julia Roberts plays a struggling mother with three kids who lands a job at a local law firm working as a secretary. She stumbles upon a water contamination case that has been killing off residents of a small town. She fights to bring the water company who started it all to court. She is a sassy woman who will not take ""no"" for an answer and always gets what she wants somehow. This is a very touching and powerful film that depicts one of Julia Roberts' best performances! Albert Finney also does a wonderful job with his role. This is a movie everyone should see.Wonderful in every way! Oscar buzz abounds this movie!"
1,beware of format,"The movie Erin Brockovich is wonderful -- an important story, well-told. However, it was not clear at the time of ordering this particular video version that it would not be compatible with an HD Tv and regular DVD player. The format of the HD DVD version cannot be played without a proprietary HD DVD player. The 1-star rating is just to get your attention to the problem. The original film is at least 4-star!"
2,Disappointing,"I just can't find the Oscar material here. Keep in mind Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors (""The Limey"" is destined to be a classic, I believe) and yes, the film is well shot and edited, but I find the subject matter... well, boring and predictable. I'm told by female friends that Erin is a ""hero"" to them. Hm? Single mom dresses and talks like a prostitute, has an uncontrollable temper, and takes everything personally, and wonders why people won't give her a break. Ok.... Single mom can't pay the phone bills but seems to have an endless supply of cash for spiked-heeled shoes. Am I leaving anything out? Oh, right: Once the class action suit is in place, the participants are more comfortable with her than the trained lawyers. Very nice, people skills are important in the legal profession. So is knowledge of the law! This is a blueprint for a heroine?"
2,"if not for julia r, would we watch this movie?","so you have a female enpowerment film. ok, now problem. more power to you. but this woman uses her body to get things done. wait! a contradiction. what are we telling young girls--you can be a better man by being a bad woman?sad"
2,Too much attitude,"The story was fascinating. The more I followed it, the more intrigued I was with the workings of the big unethical corporation. What I did not care for was Julia Roberts as Erin Brokovich. Was Ms Brokovich really that much of a b****? I felt no compassion for her. But then, I guess Erin Brokovich doesn't want anyone's compassion. I'm the first to admit that I'm jealous of Julia Roberts' success as an actress. But when she plays aggressive, obnoxious characters and then gets Oscars, magazine covers with that big, grinning face, and praise as a result, I get irritated. I look forward to the next embarrassing National Inquirer cover with her on it. She has almost as much attitude as Shaft."
3,Sexy and Predictable,"Let's face it, though it was entertaining, it was little more than a TV movie of the week. If Julia wasn't so dynamic it would have bombed. Her performance was good, not her best. I guess it was just her turn to go home with Oscar. And from what I can ascertain, it seems as if she's not going to be the glittering star in the night sky for too much longer. Unless of course she manages to get a little bit more into acting, and less into these kinds of public approval movies that are made just for cash."
2,Highly Overrated,Julia Roberts won an Oscar for this??????? She can't act and this movie was tremendously overrated. Definitely skip this one.
3,Good but not Oscar Worthy,"""Erin Brockovich"" is one of the three films nominated for Oscars that i have seen, and I don't see this one taking home the statue. Okay, so it was a true story, that doesn't make it a great film. I guess my expectations were too high as I had heard that it was a great film. Julia Roberts was good as the title character, but I had no sympathy for her. It seemed as if as soon as Erin had a real job and was out trying to get PG&E, her family seemed to not matter much to her. This is just what I got from what I saw on film. I am just very surprised at the academy this year, for including this film in it's nominations. In my own personal opinion, I don't think it is deservant of it. Nor does Julia Roberts deserve a Best Actress Nod. There was nothing stunning or awesome about her performance. It was decent. The movie is worth a rental fee, but i wouldn't buy it."
4,Erin Brockovich,"This movie had a real STORY to tell and what one person can really do, if they're committed to doing something about a company who thinks it's above anyone and anything else! I enjoyed it because I thought it was very well done and was also a TRUE story.Very course language (probably for authenticity) and not for anyone under 17 or 18, I would suggest. Anyone younger probably wouldn't get anything out of it anyway. Its geared for adults anyway due to the subject matter (chemicals seeping into private wells, etc.)."
4,Wonderful performance by Roberts,"This film has something for everyone: If you're a guy, it has Roberts in skimpy clothing. If you're a girl, it has Roberts in skimpy clothing acting...and acting well. In a script that seems tailor-made for her, Julia Roberts makes the most out of being witty, quirky and beautiful. That this is based on a true-story is typically grounds for me to start groaning. Still, it had Roberts in skimpy clothing...so I bit. I'm glad I did. Albert Finney is a definite supporting Oscar favorite at this point and Julia should have a lock on a nomination as well (and should win the Globe for best comedic). The witty repartee between these two alone makes Brockovich a worthy film, but add in across-the-board solid acting by the rest of the supporting cast (including my favorite underused film actress, Cherry Jones) and you have a delightful film that should be the highlight of any dinner party you throw at home."
3,Good Value:Pleasing Appearance and Value for the Price,"I have to say, for what I paid I think this is a very cute, elegant set. It is not as thick as I would have liked as far as the bumper goes, but this is not an expensive bedding set, either. For the reviewer who was unhappy with the material, the fabric is rather thin, but this lends itself to the shabby chic theme. The colors were very nice and muted; I disagree with the reviewer who thought they were florescent. As far as the set goes, as a complete ensemble is works and is very easy to match with solid roses and sages. Not your plush, top of the line set, but a good deal for the money."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This book was a page turner. I stayed up late several nights, unable to put it down! Suspensful and intrigueing. Great story about the loss of faith and the search for inner peace in the midst of turmoil and hidden family secrets. Linda is vivid in her details of scenery and people. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great mystery."
2,Too Secular For Me,"I started reading books by this author as an alternative to secular fiction. This is the fourth I've read and I've decided against reading any more (I'm a little slow). While Hall's writing style is interesting and easy to read, I was disappointed to find incest, murder, premarital sex etc. in Christian literature. There was mention of church and some characters grappled with spiritual issues, but these themes were minor in my opinion. Perhaps I need to leave the mystery genre to find more wholesome topics.Other Linda Hall books I've read: Sadie's Song, Katheryn's Secret, Island of Refuge"
5,Good Wrench Rack,"I did a lot of research before I bought this wrench rack. Lot's of Googling and web searching was involved. I went to Sears, Lowe's, Home Depot, Harbor Freight, Walmart, etc. (I had some down time during a medical recovery.) This wrench rack was the winner. It holds the wrenches quite securely so they won't pop out in the tool box when you are digging around for some other tool. Good price, too."
3,Alec Empire plays with keyboards.,"Although all DHR-related releases tend to be a bit self-indulgent, this one is the champ. Most of the album is just semirandom keyboard noodlings. A couple of tracks are good (2, 9, 10) and ""opus 28; pour la liberte des mille universes"" is great, but overall it's a bit much. Don't expect any breakbeats or yelling if all you've heard previously is Atari Teenage Riot."
5,Wonderful! I'll read over and over,"This book has quickly become one of my all time favorite books. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read it. It ranks up there with my favorite chick flicks and books! I'll reread it again and again whenever I need a good cry.The novel starts out with Daria Camfield and her husband Nate serving as missionaries in Columbia South America. Daria is young, and in love. One day Nate heads to a neighboring village to help and after he doesn't return Daria finds out he's died. She returns home and moves on with her life.And then one day a telegram arrives that says Nathan is still alive.The rest of the book deals with the heartbreakingly hard choices Daria has. The thing I liked most about this book is that there isn't an easy answer. No matter what she chooses to do, people's lives will be changed forever. It made me think about the ending for days after I read the book. I can't wait to read it again!"
2,"old and fat now, where is 70's early 80's FHAT?","well I had a feeling even before I got this DVD they were gonna be old and fat and not allot of energy. pretty much what I paid for. Its like lets release something to make some money. rip off. Slow Ride and I go back 20 years! used to shower to it every morn in HS! haha. drove my mom crazy. Led Zep released their prime stuff from 70's so why not these guys.If you read my other reviews you can see I am picky, well hey once you see/hear GOOD. then average just falls by the wayside. I flunk most concert dvd's, and they deserve it."
5,A superb adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece!,"I've seen all three cinematic portrayals of this book (assuming there are only three), and this is my favorite. It's a lot more faithful to the book than the Greer Garson Hollywood version, and I also found it superior to the late 70's PBS production (although the PBS version had better casting in certain roles --- their Jane and Elizabeth were more attractive, I thought). Still, this latest production was excellent, worth watching repeatedly!"
5,Masterful Novel becomes Masterful Film,"One of Jane Austen's finest works, Pride and Prejudice, has come to video in a magical production by Simon Langton. Colin Firth plays a spectacular role as Mr. Darcy, giving the character the life that Jane Austen penned him to lead. Relatively ingenue Jennifer Ehle is the embodiment of Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. Jane Austen's work is being done justice in film these days- from Emma Thomspons' beautifully adapted Sense and Sensiblity, to Gweneth Paltrow's portrayal of Emma. In recent years, both Thompson and Paltrow have been recognized for their spectacular ability. Unfourtunately, an A&E production such as this could not have been recognized at the Oscars, but it is apparent that this cast and crew deserve the same noteworthy recognition as the actors that have been in a larger Jane Austen production have received. Pride and Prejudice is definitely a smart buy and most assuredly an entertaining film to see."
5,Wonderful Adaptaion,After reading some reviews I was worried about the DVD quality. I was pleased to find that the color in the DVD was not washed out and looked very good! This A&E presentation was a very good representation of the book. The acting and costumes were phenominal! I thought that Lydia and Mr. Bingley were cast perfectly. This DVD is a must for any Pride and Prejudice fan. It was well worth the money.
5,Very faithful to the Austen book,This is the DVD edition to buy. Colin Firth is the definitive Darcy. All characters played out their roles superbly. The costumes and settings are just perfect and the screenplay is so true to the book. Watch youtube for previews.
5,Pride and Prejudice Superb!,I just love this movie!!! This is one of my favorite movie of all times. This movie is 5 hours long but it is worth. You may like the 2 hour version but there is more details in the movie and more scenes that would miss. I gives this 5 stars!!! And I like the actor and actress who plays Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy in this!
3,Pride and Prejudice Review,"This movie was okay, but the newer version with Kiera Knightly was the best. The casting was not good. I thought ""Lizzy"" was too light-hearted and not dramatic enough. The casting of her sister, Jane, was especially disappointing because she is supposed to be the ""beauty"" in the family, and the actress was not, no offense. I watched it once but won't watch it again. Better to rent if you must."
5,Brilliant!!!,"I'm a young reader, and also declare myself an unconditional Austen's fan. When I first read one of her books (usually I repeat) I only feel discontent in one particular way: I want to meet the characters, SEE THEM! With P&P I felt the same, so I borrowed the DVD from a friend. It was amazing, they just where there, in the real world. I first thought the characters had come to live in Colin Firth's and Jennifer Ehle's bodies! I never saw a film so much according to the original book, I could say even improving it! If you watch that film you won't feel deceived, I promise!"
2,Pride and Prejudice,Colin Firth is a first rate Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is a perfect Elizabeth Bennet. The setting for Pemberly is spectacular and the producers did a good job of staying true to the Austen spirit. Very well done.
2,What's the deal with the color?,"While I agree that this miniseries is awesome, this Special Edition DVD set pales (literally) in comparison with most other releases. My wife and I had worn out the tapes we made when the series first aired on A&E;, and have since burned through the subsequent VHS official release, and most recently have been enjoying it on the first DVD release.(...)the color/tint/brightness are all washed out. There is too much contrast in the color, bringing the lights and darks to extremes. The hue of the color is also waashed out, a little too bleak to enjoy Ms. Bennett's rosy cheeks or Mr. D'Arcy's walk from the pond...The widescreen aspect is great; it does add a bit of grandeur to the scenes, but the freaky color has us put off. Maybe if you've never seen this before, this edition would seem ok, but we feel a bit let down by the results."
5,Every bit as good as I remembered.,"This blu-ray set arrived today, some 2 weeks earlier than expected. Well done Amazon and the various postal services involved.The movie made a huge impression on me when I first saw it on TV so when I found it on blu-ray I had to have it. It's every bit as good as I remembered. The transfer to blu-ray has been well handled, too. The only gripe I have is that they've kept the original episodic construction from TV. I'd have liked the option to play the whole thing straight through, uninterrupted. Perfect for a cold, wet afternoon like today.Do I recommend this movie? You bet!"
5,Best Jane Austen movie ever,"If you enjoy Jane Austen or the Victorian era, this is the one movie you must see. It's very true to the novel and very well done. It's hard to not finish the movie in one sitting (even though it's 6 hours)."
5,Solid #2,"Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)This is my second favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The only reason it is #2 is that new 2005 version's Darcy is more attractive to me. But that's about it. The only minuses of this almost perfect adaptation are:1)the age of actors - they seem older than written in the book2)I found Jane Bennett and Caroline Bingley quite unattractive, although they are supposed to be more beautiful than Elizabeth.Other than that, one of my most favorite movies. Highly recommend!"
5,Best DVD ever,"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful, enjoyable family film. Jane Austen writes so well, and the film captures her exquiset style, wit and creativity.I recommend it to everyone. Great Job. Jane and Lizzy are so pretty."
5,Pride and Prejudice,Love this version. The actors are awesome. The scenes are great in this movie and so is the costumes. Love this DVD!!
5,A favorite,"Pride & Prejudice has long been a favorite of mine, and this production is a stand-out. Colin Firth is fantastic, and sexy as can be. A great purchase."
5,The definitive version,The BBC did the definitive adaptation of this wonderful Jane Austin novel. The cast and locations are brilliant.
1,Restored? Not so much,"DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!! If I could rate it less than one star, I would.I bought this version of Pride & Prejudice because it SAYS digitally restored. It was a HUGE mistake, as Amazon only allows replacement of the same item as far as refunds/returns go. The ""restored"" version is grainy, segmented by episode, and the only evidence of any digital restoration is in the special features clips. A friend of mine has the P&P; Special Edition and it's picture quality is leaps and bounds better, and the episodes are separated by a fade to black, not the complete credits! I am still kicking myself for wasting the money on this version, since Amazon won't let me exchange it and pay for a better copy of the movie.Remember, do not buy this ""RESTORED"" Edition. Pay a little extra for the Special Edition or the Anniversary Edition. That, you won't regret."
5,Fabulous!!,"We are a mother/daughter duo who are BIG Austen fans and we absolutely adored this rendition of Pride and Prejudice. Colin Firth is HUNKY and caught the character of Mr. Darcy to perfection. I think more little boys ought to be named ""Fitzwilliam"" if this is what they turn out like!!"
1,No subtitles,"I love Jane Austen, but am not buying this version of P & P because it offers no ""subtitles"". My system cannot handle ""closed-captioning."""
2,Where is the rest of the movie?,I ordered this 2 DVD set and sat down to watch it. The 2nd DVD ended in the middle of the story.Nowhere on the cover does it say it is just a partial movie. Which DVD set completes the movie?I was so dissapointed.
5,This is the best version of Pride & Prejudice!,"I purchased this first in Video tapes and wore them out. I now have the DVD and still love watching Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle, they are both great in their parts, as was the entire cast. It's a beautiful production!"
5,Great production; had no trouble with the video,"I bought this for my wife, who is a Jane Austen fan, and so far I have seen about 80% of it. It's full of great casting, great acting, great costumes, and wonderful sets, and we had no problems with the video that some other reviewers were finding."
1,Reproduction horrible,"I will forever love the story of Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett, but, sad to say, the poor quality of this film made it distracting. I have a beautiful bedside Toshiba television set. The color is superb, yet this film was so colorless. No tone, depth, downright pale. I didn't even bother watching the second disc. It was the price that lured me. If you don't mind colorless, and you just want to hear and vaguely see the story, then by all means ..."
3,pride and prejudice,this 2 set dvd is great. i enjoy watching it over and over. it took me a while to like mr. darcy. he eventually grows on you and you know he is right for elizabeth.
4,The Best Pride and Prejudice,"This is one of the few book to movie productions I have seen that have actually got it right. Because it was a miniseries, they were able to put everything that was in Jane Austen's book into this film. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy I have seen in a film. He gets the character so well, and was able to portray it truthfuly. All of the other actors did a great job too, and the locations in which everything was filmed was perfect. It is worth watching this over and over."
5,A must have classic,"This is a classic. I decided my old million vhs tape set was ready to be let go, it is so nice to have it in two disks! The newer (keira knightly) version has more heat. The younger generation who has only seen that one may not warm to this version as quickley, but I love it. More details! And this one makes it much more clear at the end how bad what Lydia has done is, a concept that seems a little lost in the movie theatre version. My husband doesen't get it. But I know the rest of you Jane Austin fans do!"
5,"""Beautifully Done""","Don't let the fact that there are six video tapes in this set intimidate you. I found myself watching all six in one evening (even though I planned to watch only one). Jane Austen's talent for romantic comedy are brought vividly to life. The costumes, the scenery, and the talented actors, take us to that place we thought we would only find in the pages of Austen's novels. Like the book, we cannot wait to see what happens next! My whole family enjoyed this movie and I recommend it highly. You will watch it over and over again."
5,Wonderful,Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth has to be one of the best movies ever made. You watch this movie with a smile glued to your face and then pair the movie with the book and you have a wonderful way to spend a weekend. I can watch this movie and read the book over and over and still see/read something that I had missed the previous time. This is a classic in the first sense.
1,Pride & Prejudice re-mastered version USA,"I received this copy of Pride & Prejudice, the one with the green cover, in the hope that the digitally remastered version, sold as ""the ultimate in picture and sound quality"". I have to tell you that the picture quality, compared to one I bought in the UK 2 years ago,is simply ATROCIOUS! It is still green and very black, without hightlights in the eyes or in the architectural details. Have I been sent a bootleg copy for $15.49? If you want the beautifully restored version, then buy the the one from the UK!"
1,pride and prejudice A&E edition,"The DVD is of poor quality. The colors are washed out and the focus is variable ( from poor to just acceptable) throughout the video. I had another copy of this with normal color and good focus throughout. I returned the DVD, and the seller was very good with this. The item is poor and in the unacceptable category, while the seller rates 5 stars."
2,"Plodding, Dull.Sorry!","I'll watch Colin play Darcy in ""Bridget Jones"". This film moves like watching paint dry. And the actors all seem so stiff and their concerns so trivial. It is a favorite with some in my family so I have been force fed it on a number of occasions. Not for me!Give me the Keira Knightley version anyday.The Camera work is brilliant and the soundtrack , original I might add, is beautiful! Sounds like Chopin.Oh, and the actresses are all WAY too OLD!They all appear to be in their thirties where the girls in the Keira Knightly version appear to be just that, GIRLS! Silly behavior from a Kitty who IS 14 years old is infinately more palatable that the same behavior from a 30 year old! And I really got tired of the matronly looking Lizzie pursing her lips."
5,Absolutely the best version!!!,This is the best version of Pride & Prejudice I've seen. I own it & watch it often.
5,EYE CANDY FOR A HISTORY LOVER,"I'm a historian and author of history (""CALIFORNIA PIONEERS""), so what do I do to give myself a ""holiday"" without leaving the house? I reach for this superb version of Jane Austen's best-loved tale of history, romance and intrigue.This version's backdrop is a countryside rich with the splendor of a time forgotten... a time when one's station in life was all one had to get by on...a time lost in the hustle and bustle of modern lifestyles. The scenery is eye candy and the acting is the best to come out of the U.K. in decades. This is a masterpiece adaptation that truly does justice to Jane Austen's original novel. That said...get this movie for yourself and share it only with others whom you are absolutley postive will return it!"
1,Pride & Prejudice Special Edition,"The color in this DVD edition is awful - no peachy English complexions here! Another review commented on this color transfer loss but I thought it might be an anomale. How very disappointing to find that the DVD copy of my favorite show of all time is literally a pale, lacklustre version compared to my faithful VHS. Major bummer - the DVD can't be returned once opened!"
3,Special Edition DVD edits out content,"I have seen this excellent movie starring Colin Firth, in an unedited version on a six volume set for VHS. This was available at my local library. This version show a lot more of the traditional dances and other dialogue scenes that the Special Edition DVD edits out. I have not found where to buy this unedited version on VHS or DVD."
2,Untypically boring of Vonnegut,"Compared to the other 10 Vonnegut novels I've read, I found this one to be rather slow-moving. To further make it uninteresting, he repeatedly tells you what's going to happen looong before it does, which leaves you with ""well it's about time that happened. no big surprise."" The characters never get fully developed either, which leaves you not really caring what happens to them. This is the lowest rating I've ever given Vonnegut."
2,Not my favorite of Vonnegut's works.,"With Vonnegut, it's always hard to tell what he is truly trying to convey to the reader. It seems, at times, that even he loses track of the plot and that may be the true brilliance of his style. Galapagos, on the other hand, did not contain much of Kurt's usual cynicism and wit. It stumbled forward at times never fully fulfilling the reader's hopes....at least for me it didn't. If this was his outlandish attempt at being like Michener, I truly hope it was his only attempt. I must reiterate I do enjoy Kurt Vonnegut but there are some things better left unsaid and some stories better left unwritten."
3,Galapagos,GalapagosThe plot is a bit fanciful and far fetched to be entertaining although setting a futuristic scene for humanity in the Galapagos ( with Darwinian survival of the fittest connotations ) is quite clever.
3,What school makes u read,"This book was purchased as a book we had to have for our kid, high school. Turned out I read it also. Was a great book. Thought it would have been boring 'cause of the ap-english class. Know for classics, not great reading material.. Surprislingly good."
3,Survival of the misfits,"Written with typical Vonnegut esprit, Galapagos is an entertaining read. The pages fly by and, although a little laboured and repetitive at times, the hallmark humour is present. What it lacks, however, is the depth of some of his other work. Compared to Player Piano and Slaughterhouse 5 this is a slight work that doesn't resonate for long in the mind once finished. It's fun but it's not Vonnegut at his best."
2,Hardly his best work...,"Galapagos is an O.K. book, but perhaps the worst of Vonnegut's books I've read. For beginners, I found it a bit difficult to get into the book due to its non-linear storyline. Sometimes this method works, like in Slaughterhouse 5, but sometimes it doesn't, which I feel applies to Hocus Pocus as well as this book. While the idea behind this book is interesting (showing the humoristic elements of evolution, and, I suppose, analogously showing the absurdity of other forms of progression such as tradition), the novel just seemed to be too long for such a single idea. While I liked the humorous elements typical of every Vonnegut novel, their comedic impact was increasingly outweighed by the monotony of the novel's exposition."
5,side spltingly funny,"any one who enjoys a good old fashond comody will love see no evil, hear no evil. gene wilder and richard pryor are an absolutly hillarious duo."
3,funny stuff,"I ve always enjoyed this movie. Of the movies wilder & pryor did together this is my favorite. I know other people would debate that because of how good silver streak & stir crazy were but again I like this one the best!its goofy and a little exaggerated with a blind & deaf guy running around catching bad guys but its fun! they have great chemistry together and wilder always been one my favorites considering hes been involved with a number of great movies. when I saw this in the theatre I didnt know who kevin spacey was but that guy has come along way as an actor himself.anyway, this flick is worth checking out for the stellar banter between wilder & pryor including the inept cops chasing them!"
4,classic movie,When movies where done well and told great storys. Well told and very enter taining. When stories told some thing not like current movies where they just want to show gun fire to move the story forward.
2,Not expecting this one,"When I think of Alec Empire....I think Digital Hardcore. After I bought this I was very dissapointed, The tracks are real mellowcore and not really for the kore junkies. Its good music to sleep to. Buy the album if you are a Alec Empire fan.....but dont buy it if you want kore."
2,Not very well made - very rushed,"A clunky DVD - a rushed product without much polish. Lots of footage, but mostly footage of very little that's interesting to watch."
3,I can see the light!,"It is really hard to completely seal the light off with this mask. Yes, it is light and confortable (with the exception of the velcro on the back always sticking to my hair even when it is tied up), but light comes through from the nasal part. It is quite bothersome."
3,"Not bad, but light still gets in","This product is nice because I can open my eyes while the mask is on without having my eyelids touch the mask. Unfortunately, light still gets in at the bottom around my nose. I think this mask only blocks out all the light for some people. I suspect that the wider your nose is, the more likely this product will block out all the light. Since it's relatively high priced, I expected more out of it. I would not buy another one or recommend it for the price."
2,average person can not wear with out doing some modifications,whats good about the productgives the eyes room to blinkkeeps out the darknice touch the ear plugs as wellWhat Kills the productI bought this product in the past maybe a year ago and as it was a year ago still isthat the elastic/velcro band is much too short to go around the head of an average persons headI had to add some eleastic and sew the additions on to make it fit properly ... I hope the MFG willmake the band at least one inch longer for Average persons heads other than that EXCELLENT product
3,"works ok, lets in too much light","I was impressed with this when I first put it on because it blocked out all the light and didn't press against my eyes. However, once I lay my head down it's virtually impossible to get it to block out the light all the way. Will probably end up buying something else."
5,Wish I'd bought one of these years ago!,"Wore it for the first time last night. Helped me get the best night's sleep that I've ever had in a very long time. Been suffering from sleep deprivation for months, so this sleep mask is like a god-send to me.Many thanks to the reviewers who said great things about it, as that encouraged me to order one. And I'm glad I did.So if you are looking for a sleep mask, I highly recommend this one."
1,GARBAGE QUALITY,OWNED IT A MONTH AND THE SEEMS ON THE ENTIRE SLEEP MASK IS FALLING APART! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO THROW MONEY AWAY!
3,Eh,"I am kinda middle of the road on this. I like the room in the eye area, it doesn't mash my eyes when I sleep. I was however hoping that it would block the light better."
4,"Good, comfortable light blocking","I purchased this for a transatlantic flight. They were very comfortable and did provide good light blocking. The ""with earplugs"" is a little deceptive in my opinion as they're just the little foam ear plugs which you use once or twice and pitch. If you want good, comfortable sound reduction - plan on buying something else. I got what I expected however as I bouught it for the sleep mask, not the earplugs."
3,So-so mask,"If you have a small head, it is hard to tighten the strap on the mask enough so that it will not slip off. Also, there is always some light that slips through.Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch - Black"
2,"Just like everyone else, the material fell apart!","The mask is comfortable and the light truly is blocked out. However, after 2 months, the material started coming apart in layers. If you are looking for something that lasts, do NOT get this mask. Just like every other review for this product, the material truly does come apart in layers."
2,"Meh. I prefer the free, polyesther version I got from an airline.","My issues with this product were A) that the strap was too tight, and the velcro caught on my hair, and B) light was not fully blocked, possibly due to the shape of my nose. It crept in along the bottom of the mask."
2,Side-sleepers need not apply,I've never used a sleep mask before. If I had I would have already known that it would be challenging to use one while sleeping on my side. Especially since this one has the contours for your eyes. Just didn't work for me. If I slept on my back it probably would work fine.
2,Pretty flimsy,"This is the second sleep mask I've used. The first was a gift which replaced my black sock/shoelace contraption and lasted probably 5 years before I figured I'd buy a new one. While this mask performs the task of blocking light admirably, its outer layer of fabric has split from its inner layer after only 2 months of nightly use. I'll keep using it until it deteriorates further, but I am disappointed and won't buy another."
5,Perfect fit at last,I've purchased about 6 different masks but each of them seemed to smash my eyes. To complicate matters I also wear a cpap and combining the two is pretty challenging. My search is finally at an end now that I've found the Dream Essentials Mask. It creates the perfect empty pocket of my eyes to block light without touching my eyes or smashing my nose. Bravo!
4,worked great,Blacks out the sun nicely. Was able to nod off on twelve hour flight into the sun so it never went down!
2,Short life-span,"I was thrilled when I got this eye mask, it had everything I was looking for. It was molded, so it was super comfortable, and very light on your face. And it kept out absolutely all light. However, after only two weeks of wearing the mask every night, the fabric all started peeling away. It continued until the fabric on either side of the mask was completely unconnected from the foam. I was very disappointed."
5,My favorite sleep mask; effectively blocks out light,"Not perfect, but out of all the sleep masks I've tried, this sleep mask has been the best in blocking out light. I think it's because this one also covers your nose, which helps to block out light that might peek through other sleep masks.Only drawback is that after a little over the year, the mask has been starting to wear out (the fabric is peeling off). However, it still functionally works (I now alternate it with a new Dream Essentials mask), and for the extra sleep I've been able to get from using it, I still consider it a worthwhile investment."
2,Falls apart,"This was initially one of the most comfortable and effective sleep masks I had used, but when it began to fall apart (outer fabric and inner padding started to separate completely), I threw it out. With the outer fabric separated from the inner padding, the mask was no longer comfortable, and there was no way I could really either fix it myself or deal with it. It ended up in the trash after about 5 months."
5,Excellent sleep mask.,"This us the most comfortable sleep mask I have ever worn. The contoured eye area prevents the mask from touching the eyes, which is always bothersome in other masks, and the adjustable band with velcro, permits a perfect fit around the head, in contrast to others that always feel too snug. Though a tiny sliver of light appears at the bottom, this is absolutely no problem. The darkness in the morning, when my room is otherwisevery light, is perfect."
2,Leaks Light,"Purchased and tried the Lewis N. Clark Comfort Eye Mask, the Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams, and the Dream Essentials Escape Luxury Sleep Mask.The Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Eye Mask is lightweight and comfortable but unfortunately lets in light from the sides of my nose.Only the Dream Essentials Escape keeps out all the light."
4,Great but pinches nose,This mask plus the case and free ear plugs are really everything I was looking for to help me block out distractions at night. The nose is somewhat small so it pinches my nose but it is only a slight discomfort. If you like to sleep on your side you may not like the mask because it will press awkwardly on your face due to the shape of it.
4,Comfy,"Very comfortable, blocks most light. The material on the bottom of the mask unraveled, though, and has become a nuisance."
5,nite nite,"I just ordered 2 of these mask. I had ordered the first one back in 2009, these two I got for a friend and a spare for me. It is a great product. Some light might come in around the nose, just press all around the nose. I really like the mask, it helps me sleep at night."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","Looks cool from the outside. Lets some light in up through the sides of the nose. There's a better one I've used before, with super soft spongy foam, which contoured comfortably to the sides of the nose perfectly, letting in no light at all. This is not that one."
2,Only 3 stars here's why,"I ordered a medium and the mask was way too large for my face.. There were only 2 sizes available at my time of purchase: medium and XS.. They should allow more flexibility with the sizing. Also, there is a bit of light let in with this mask at the bottom. If you have JUST the right nose, it will probably be perfect for you.. I guess my nose is too small for this mask. Also, I can't turn over easy with this mask on. I only give it 2 and probably won't wear it again."
4,Works just fine...,"I bought this about 4 - 5 months ago and I have no regrets. It is the most comfortable eye mask I have ever used. If you are looking for a good eye mask, this is it......"
5,Comfortable and cheap,"I've had this mask for about six months now and I ordered a two more for gifts this Christmas. I am sensitive to light, but the mask allowed me to sleep later in the morning. It was especially helpful in the morning in midsummer here in Minnesota and when we went to Iceland on vacation. It's immediately comfortable and allows you to open your eyes inside without pressure. There is a little light leakage around the bottom but that doesn't cause problems for casual use."
4,Works pretty well,"I needed a mask to help me get to sleep sooner and to sleep better. I have a lot of ""light pollution"" in my room - light leaking around the window blinds, green light from an alarm clock, flickering lights from computer equipment.This mask does a pretty good job blocking the light. I find when I use the mask that it calms my mind quicker and I tend to fall asleep sooner. I would recommend it, but I am aware that everyone's face shape is different, so shopping around might be neccesary."
5,Just a great product.. i own 3!,"I have insomnia and days are long with an hour drive one way to work.. so i need to take a mid day mini nap on my lunch break. Ive had eye masks before but to me they just hurt because my eye lashes were kinda pushed back..I saw these and first of course noticed the price, and than saw it came with ear plugs. NOT too bad! (Compare the price and they are about the same if not a little cheaper than others).So i get them in.. and i will say that they adjusted nicely and comfortabley to my head (my head size is a bit larger).I put it on and there is a little bump out where your eyes/eyelashes go. Its great!!It blocked out most of the light, didnt interfere with blinking or my eye lashes, and was affordable.I bought another pair for at home, and another pair for travel.I highly approve."
3,Not for big headed people,"I guess I'm one of the unlucky people that have a large head and while the elastic is good enough to snap around, it becomes so tight that the nose part of the mask pinches my nose and doesn't let me sleep. Shame too, because the mask is quite comfy looking."
4,Good but doesn't last forever,"I just bought my second one of these masks. I can't sleep without one because of the plethora of light in my apt in mornings. I've used it every night and its definitely the best mask I've purchased. I love the contours for the eyes so its not pushed up against your eyelids. It also really blocks out the light, nothing can get in, when its still new.I bought my first one a year ago and about 4 months ago I noticed it really became to stretched out to stay on my head anymore and I noticed the shape of the mask began to flatten. I received my replacement yesterday and comparing them saw how stretched out it had become but hey for the price and for the amount I've used it. Definitely worth it.I don't have use for the carrying case and the earplugs are standard ones that I wouldn't use more than once or twice."
2,Not so Dream Sleep,"I'm not wearing my new sleep mask. Firstly the shape doesn't seem to fit that well. The contour actually makes it uncomfortable as it presses against my nose especially if I want to turn my head. Secondly, the velcrose fastener gets stuck to my hair. If you sleep only on your back and don't move it is probably fine."
3,Like it except it's falling apart,"I really like this mask, it's comfortable and the nose portion blocks out a lot more light than the sleep masks I've had in the past. However, barely a month after I started wearing it, the liner started to detach itself from the inside of the mask. It's still attached now, but I'm going to have to sew it back together.This might've just been a random defect, of course. I'd still recommend the mask as it works so well, but bear in mind you might have to make a repair at some point."
1,Looks like would work well but very poor quality,"Took it out of the box, put it on...Fits well, although a little bit of light peeked in from the bottom, but it was pretty comfortable.Unfortunately, when I took it off I noticed that one end of the elastic strap that attaches directly to the eyepiece was frayed and only being held on by threads. I'm in the process of returning it to Amazon.I don't think this is a one off problem... overall the manufacturing quality seemed fairly poor, irregardless of the defect in my particular mask. Definitely won't be buying anything else from Dream Essentials..."
5,absolutley superb!,"thick,harmonic,floating,temporal ambience! an absolute must have for anyone who likes electronica or ambient! a classic for sure."
3,Average Guide,"This book was an average guide. It didn't get nearly the workout as the Birnbaum's Guide. However, this guide was helpful with all of the various local hotels and restaurants. I probably would not buy any updates of this guide though."
1,Sent by Mistake,After finding the 2009 version of this book I cancelled the ordering of the 2006 version.This was after 30 minutes. The web site stated the order was cancelled.The 2006 book arrived 6 days latter 2 days after the 2009 one and numerous attempts to stop it.I have learned my lesson with Amazon and will beware in the future.DK
3,The good ol' days when men were men and women were too...,"Grunts, groans, grime and gore are the key ingredients here. English definitely wants to be sure his audience understands what thirty pounds of pointed steel can do to flesh. The rest of the film is basically a by-the-book castle seige carried out in drab dirty-dozen style. Worst of all, you have to wait over an hour for the sex scene and the stupid director decides to not go graphic after going over the top with all the slicing and dicing preceding it. Lame. Cornball performances make sure you don't have much sympathy for any of the casualties. Definitely a hack job, but at least it's the kind of Medieval entertainment that does manage to get the bad taste of a Summer Renaissance Fair out of your mouth."
5,Ironclad was awesome!,"I don't watch very many movies anymore, but I really wanted to see this one. And I wasn't dissappointed! This movie was awesome! Really good graphic special effects in the fight scenes and plenty of awesome action! I'm no expert in movies these days, but I can honestly say that Ironclad was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It had a great story and really good acting by everyone in it.I was really impressed with the actor that played King John. He was top notch in his performance. I was really impressed with this movie and I think everyone should see it. You won't be disappointed!Five stars! Nay, ten stars!"
3,Falls apart halfway through,"Its a great, well thought out, intelligent, fairly accurate (well, almost) scientific movie for the first hour...then the T-Rex comes out. All of a sudden every intelligent thing that was building in the first half is thrown out the window, and all we see for an hour are people running from dinosaurs. It's still a good movie and with some spectacular effects, but overall it seems to be lacking something. I understand this movie was meant to entertain, but the story starts out like Einstein and ends up like Gomer Pyle. The DVD transfer is OK, like others noted the flesh tones are inconsistent from scene to scene. All in all, JP was one of the better movies of the 90's (for what it's worth) and like Spielberg's other man vs. animal flick, Jaws, everyone's gotta see it at once. Lots of neat extras on the DVD as well!"
4,"Good Movie, Best of All of Them","I think it is a good movie, not much blood.Lots of good actors.Not good for kid 1-5 or 6.HAVE A FUN TIME"
1,"i Love when tim says""that was grate'","i LOVE jurassic park.and my favorite star is joseph mazzello ""tim"""
5,This movie was way ahead of it's time!,"This movie I saw and I couldn't believe how they could possibly make something like that! Today we have all this computer graphic junk, but not all of this movie was made with computer. They had an actual guy in the TRex in some scenes! You'll love this movie if you like anything fun!"
5,awesome!!!!!,"I had been seen this movie 10 years ago. I wanted to watch this movie with my kids becuase they didn't watch this movie before. my kids liked the movie. This is very good family movie. The picture quality of instant moive is very good and I would recommend to watch this movie, who have not been before, purticulary children."
5,Whers the dinos,This movie is great!Only one person gets eaten.But when they go on the tour they dont see any dinos...until the T-Rex gets free in the park!This movie is funny exiting and fun!
2,No digital copy included.,"Movie is great as always. But...maybe I'm just unlucky. The first DVD I ordered was right and had digital copy (which is a download code for the electronic movie and bonus features files), but the DVD was all scratched up. The replacements (twice now) from Amazon have come without digital copy, and the ""100th Anniversary"" special jacket. It's possible that they've run out of the 100th anniversary DVDs, and are just sending out regular ones mistaking them for the described product. What the heck. Still enjoyable, and the special effects still look believable all these years later."
5,The man is good,What can I say.. if you don't have this in your dvd collection.. you are not a true movie buff... a great family movie with horror comedy action and suspense. the excellent transfer of video and earth shattering audio.. GET THIS DVD!
5,Classic,Santa brought our 4 year old son (and dinosaur lover) this movie for Christmas. It's just as awesome as I remember it! Thank you Amazon for your speedy delivery!
2,Typical SPielberg garbage...,"This is a typical Spielberg garbage: empty characters, a cast of bad actors, the full emphasis on special effects and not the history. Blergh!"
1,Formatting issues.,"Jurassic Park is a great movie - by far the best of the trilogy. Unfortunately, there was a formatting issue with this digital movie & my Samsung LED HD TV. The movie would play HD video only, with no audio soundtrack. I repurchased the digital version twice but it never worked. It played fine (both HD video & audio) on my Kindle Fire HD, however. Amazon support was very helpful in trying to solve the problem, but we were never able to make it work."
2,"Dull, Clue-less, depressing, and just plain boring!","I found this book extremely strange and depressing. I mean, a book about a war, killing children by vomiting up blood. The book starts with Sarah, William, Catherine and Veronica. by the end of the chapter the only survivour is one of them. The book features mutants as the dominet species and that they are superior to humans. Its a load of rubbage. i found it quite boring and depressing, do not read it if your in a happy mood, because it will put you right off!!!"
3,Not their best,"While it tends to unfairly ignored, Damned Damned Damned's follow-up was always going to be difficult, and Music for Pleasure isn't nearly as good.Having said that, it still has it's good points. Problem Child and Stretcher Case wouldn't have sounded out of place on Damned Damned Damned and Idiot Box is the highlight of the album. But none of the songs on Music for Pleasure have the energy of New Rose or Neat Neat Neat, and it's not the best place to start if you want to hear The Damned at their best.When I first got into The Damned, I went for Damned Damned Damned, then Machine Gun Etiquette, and this was one of the last I came to. It's still good for the die-hard fan, but if you consider yourself a casual fan, go for Damned Damned Damned or Machine Gun Etiquette first."
3,Not the original!,"Although the quality of the DVD is excellent, be warned that this is NOT the original as shown on television. The introduction by Kermit the Frog is missing completely."
2,DVD Skips,Thats what I get for buying a used DVD. It skips terribly and you have to forward to thge next scene missing one of my favorite parts of the movie.
3,1970 Torture in a box!,"My husband was talking about how much he loved this Christmas movie from the 1970's. Well, I found it and we all sat down (teenage kids too) to watch it. Oh my, what can I say but I'm so glad the 70's are over. It was a good laugh and plenty of dad teasing for all of us. It was beyond hokey. If your looking for a sappy puppet movie look no further. Emmet Otter will leave you in tears...of laughter."
4,Favorite from childhood,One of the fondest memories from HBO as a child that I now share with my children 25 years later.
3,Who releases DVDs with LESS content than the original?!?!?,"Someone who let Disney get a hold of Kermit, that's who. I have an earlier VHS release of this movie which my family has watched many times. My daughter has about worn it out so I bought the ""collector's edition"" DVD. There's more than just Kermit missing. The extra's are just bits taken from the ""making-of"" special HBO did during the original release. Nice to see those, but inexcusable to re-release on DVD with the main feature edited down significantly from the original airing (not just the few seconds some claim). Oh, and the edited out parts are NOT in the extras, as someone claimed on here (I hoped for that too). Best bet is to find the old VHS copy, a new DVD, and get someone to edit them together. Thanks, Disney, you license-happy, money-grubbing *&#$@! (not suitable for children). ""Screw the kids, if we don't get a fat cut, then it stays in the vault!"" Jim and Walt are probably both rolling in their graves!"
2,HIT is not to blame... DISNEY is the evil culprit.,"According to MuppetCentral.com, HIT entertainment did everything they could to include Kermit in this dvd edition. They claim that Disney would not allow it at any price.Walt Disney Company prevented what would have been an ultimate edition of this beloved video. To hell with them."
3,Don't blame the current distributor for this butchered version...,"The loss of Kermit in the current version is not Henson's fault or the distributor's fault. The blame lies squarely with Disney, who now own the Muppet franchise, and refused to allow Kermit to appear in this edition, and Emmet Otter is not the only Henson title to raise the ire of Muppet fans. A Muppet Christmas Carol now has both widescreen and full-screen versions in the same package, but the widescreen version is the theatrical cut, and the fullscreen version is the recycled extended edition. The Muppet Show first season disc uses the British episodes but deletes several bits and pieces. The Muppet Movie 50th Anniversary edition is no improvement over the original and loses the test footage from the original release.Look around for used copies from Amazon resellers or on Ebay if you want Kermit in your version."
4,A New Video To Me,I thought I had seen almost every thing that Jim Henson had made but I was wrong. I am a great Muppet Lover and Jim Henson did a wonderful job with this DVD. It shows just how much a Mother and Son carried about each other and what they did to make each other's Christmas just a little bit brighter. The DVD is wonderful and the music is pleasant.
4,Curd Duca - Switched-On Wagner,"A fascinating album -- taking the basic notes from various Richard Wagner compositions, Curd Duca reprocesses them into an electronic format. The resulting album, Switched-On Wagner, has those wonderful Teutonic melodies that made Wagner famous redone entirely in machine music. It's intriguing to hear a classic tune, such as the majestic and operatic Ride of the Valkyrie (from the original Ring cycle) morphed into ""Nervous,"" a mechanical music-box sequence. Tannhauser and Siegfried receive the same treatment, their complex scores reduced to single tones. It's an interesting experiment, though your patience with it will depend on how highly you regard Wagner to begin with."
3,Listen to Listen,Out of Iowa... Just like you know who. Downthesun are just like you know who. BUT 'Listen' and 'Eye Confide' are classics. KEEP MAKING SONGS LIKE THOSE!
2,"Not that orginial, not that impressive","I definitely disagree with the other reviewer that claimed that this album is too heavy for nu-metal fans. I would consider it a nu-metal album, not hardcore or death metal and I don't knock all nu-metal, but this album left something to be desired. At least the vocalist doesn't try to rap (If you're into that check out E-town Concrete or Candiria) and there are some decent, if uninspired, riffs on the album. There is some industrial/electronic influence on the album which I like, but the lyrics to most of the songs are pretty cheesy. The band sounds similar to Chimaira and American Head Charge in music and vocal style."
1,Watch your fingers with this one!,"I gave this 1 star because it does indead make tube shaped ice cubes that fit in a bottle, but to get them out is horrible. You are supposed to run hot water over the tubes to loosen the ice and then remove the bottom cover to push the ice through. I have yet to take that thing off with seriously pinching at least one finger. Huge waste of running water and time. I wish had a fireplace so I could burn it!"
5,A great movie for Kids!,"I have a 4 year old daughter who loves tinkerbell. In the same token I am VERY SELECTIVE with what i let her watch. When I knew this movie was coming out I made it a point to buy it and review it before letting her watch it to make sure it was up to my standards, but to also make sure it was age appropriate. Let me tell you the movie TOTALLY gets my approval. It is a great fun movie that shows conflict resolution as well as quite a few other very important ""life lessons"". I.E. Identity. The makers of this movie crafted it so well that the ""scary"" parts are not scary and trust me when i say my daughter can get scared easily sometimes. Not only was this movie great for my daughter, I really think children of ALL ages will gain different learning perspectives based on their learning curve. As far as I'm concerned this is a great movie to buy and I will be buying the other Tinkerbell movie for my daughter when it comes out (reviewing it first of course;)."
2,great toy - breaks easily,The primary purpose of this review is to note that the exact same doll is only 9.99 on the Disney site. I bought it from there. My child loved it but an adult sat on it and the wing broke the 3rd day we owned it. I have ordered another. I would never have bought it at the price on this site.
4,Sweet,"My little girl loves it and it's a nice story. Me personally, I'd rather see things blown up and some partial nudity but for kids, especially young girls, you can't go wrong with this DVD."
4,blu ray is awesome,"this movie is a visual piece of art in HD. good story that really surprised me, the kids loved it and really is fun for the whole family."
4,my kids love it,"Of course girls love it, fairies and all, but even my 4 yr old son loves it too. It's not so ""girly"" that little boys won't enjoy it also."
5,Great Movie,Any little girl who likes princesses and fairies will love this movie. It tells the story of how Tinker Bell was born. I am an adult and I really enjoyed the movie.
2,I just don't get it,"Bottom line: TinkerBell can't hold a candle to traditional Disney movies like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, and certainly can't hope to compete with films like Toy Story and Shrek. The characters, plot, and dialogue are all mediocre. Usually when a movie has a four and a half star rating from almost 400 reviewers, it's a winner. But this one seemed more like a lengthy episode of a run-of-the-mill animated TV show. Not worth your money or your kid's ""screen time"" allotment."
4,Gave as Gift,My daughter is 27. Gave this in her Christmas Stocking. I believe she will always love these animated Disney movies. She said she watched it and really liked it.
5,Perfect for Preschoolers!,"We got this for my daughter as a Christmas present when she was 3 years old. It turned out to be a perfect gift! She LOVES this movie, and I don't mind watching it with her. It's not scary (it's amazing how many movies for her age group are), it's nice to look at, the sound levels are normal, and she enjoys watching it over and over. Although I've found that it holds the attention of kids of all ages, (and I like it myself) I would recommend it highly for anyone looking for a dvd for young preschoolers that may be frightened by some of the 'scarier' scenes in other animated movies."
1,Not for kids learning to count,"The title is misleading. I bought the book for my 3 year old who is learning to count. The book is essentially a bunch of text from a hockey history book (which does not engage young kids) with some numbers added to magically make it a counting book. Very bad book.Look to the ""Brady, Brady"" series for good hockey books for kids."
3,not sure yet,"I had a wallet that looked like this, but was all leather. This one is not all leather and is still very stiff. I hope it softens up as I am not happy with it the way it is. The coin purse catch also seems a bit weak."
4,beautiful wallet,"I liked it very much, but in the inside it's plastic, I wished it was leather too. The service was very good, I got it right on time."
4,Jehovah's Witnesses: what you need to know quick reference..,Good to go bravo!Jehovah's Witnesses are a destructive cult from the get go.
1,Pure Crap,This was by far one of the worst movies I've sat through in quite a while. I can only wish I had the hour and a half of torture I endured back. It's a story set in 1984 after high school graduation. The main character has his custom made surf board stolen and he and his friends set out to find it. Joan Jett is listed on everything but has only 3 scenes for a total of about 5 minutes of face time. Lucky her! I'd be embarrassed to have anymore than that in the film. The beach scenery is the best part of the movie. Do yourself a favor and pass on this garbage.
2,OUT-DATED METAL!,"This CD would have been great if it were released in the 80's. I gave it 2 stars-one for the cool cover and one for effort! The majority of my METAL collection is from the 80's but i'm really picky when it comes to adding somethng to it. The sound is just too unrefined and the production is a bit weak. I hope that their next release will be much better than this one. If you like bands like EARLY ""Judas Priest"", ""Forbidden"", ""Sanctuary"" and ""Y&T"" or just the RAW 70's & 80's sound, you'll probably like this. Don't expect any fancy or intricate arrangements. You won't find it here. I wouldn't consider them Power or Progressive Metal. They're more Hard Rock than anything."
3,Very annoying music,"I purchased Power Yoga 3 thinking it will be the hardest work out but yet it is for beginners (level 1), I don't know why it calls 3 then. It is a good program but after doing it two times I got so annoyed by the music Baptiste chose (it is a version of a modern dance music) that I can not continue with it anymore. There is no option on DVD to turn the music off. Although, music should sound in the background, during this practice it is a main thing and it is very loud. I don't know what makes experienced yoga instructors to turn away from the yoga classic music. Besides a good work out yoga is a relaxation time. Krshna music is a good combination to yoga practice. I am giving up on Baptiste's DVDs. By some reason, it is always too much of something. My all time favorite is Bryan Kest Yoga. One DVD comes with 3 different work outs (not 1 as the rest do), so it is a much better value for the great exercise."
3,Good but theatrical decor immature,"I think this is a good work,but the Video unfortunately shows a GB production, asour houses are ""too big"" for this work, as well as for many otherone-acters.Nothing monumental about this work,just too so -so !!!Kekoa"
5,Shanghai memories reignited,Assignment: Shanghai: Photographs on the Eve of Revolution reignited memories for all those that lived through the turbulent years of post WW11 Shanghai. The clear and graphical portrayal of those times came back to life. Elderly friends that lived in Shanghai at the time of this photographic history had tears in their eyes with the turning of each page. Truly if you want to understand what happened to China and in particular Shanghai -the Paris of the East as it was known- glance at these images and history will be brought to life.
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would.","When I think back on the great music of that era, this record represents the biggest wart possible. Simply awful."
5,Highly Usable Concept,This is a great concept for young and old alike. It is a very practical way to identify trees. I wish there was a complete version for all North American trees.
5,A real winner,"This first few tracks will have you leaping out of your seat. Pintame los labios is one of my favorites from this excellent CD which except for one or two less than stellar songs is one of the best of the Buena Vista discs. This is authentic son/son montuno -- I love the selection of songs picked for the album. If you've never heard the tres played before, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD. An important part of any good Cuban collection and good sound quality too."
4,Enormous fun,"For Buena Vista Social Club fans, this CD should be irresistible. A slightly more Mexican feel here and there (those trumpets again), but otherwise the same catchy tunes and extraordinary instrumental playing. Also, of the BVSC vocalists, Oliades is at the - dare I say it? - younger end of the spectrum, and his voice is a little richer as a result. He's no Pavarotti, of course, and it's really the guitar playing and instrumental arrangements that makes this disk such a joy."
2,"Good Intention, Weak Result","Braden is like that super sweet friend of yours that you can only take in small doses. And yet this is like having that friend stay in your house for a month. His overall message has some value, but it's delivered in an unfocused, self-indulgent matter - with long personal anecdotes and very little historical or scientific support. Hmmm... perhaps he's ""mirroring"" one of my own faults?This film communicates like a therapy session, rather than a workshop on spirituality or science. My preference is the latter."
4,Great book!,"This is a great book! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because my daughter is two and she turns the kids in the bed with her finger through the hole, not the notch on the side. The pages are not your normal book paper and they actually give her little paper cuts everytime she reads this book by herself. I have put it up until she gets a little older, or we can read it together."
4,english book,I liked the product. It arrived in perfect conditions and sooner as expected. We are going to use it in our english classes.
4,Ease of mind....!,"Most of us do not relish the thought of 'hereafter' kind of plans. As time goes on we hear bits and pieces from some who go full force into their estate planning and chastise those that sit back and let the pieces fall where they may.This NOLO publication is an excellent 'kick off' to making things as safe, secure and understandable as you navigate the ins and outs of your monies.I would suggest to most, bite the bullet, become informed and get this more than starter publication to ease your mind.Keep it, refer to it...and go on living!"
4,8 Ways To Avoid Probate,"Lots of good advice on how to make sure that as much of your estate as possible passes directly to your beneficiaries without the obscene legal fees and delays that the probate process usually entails. A little planning and work now can save many hours of headaches for those you leave behind, and also give you the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you have taken care of things."
3,PowerPoint,"This is rather basic, and teaches the reader to use the program by a step by step method, creating a model presentation. It lacks detailed explanations of the bells and whistles inherent in the program."
4,Damned Unlucky Days,"Del Amitri's CD ""Some Other Sucker's Parade"" doesn'tget the push it deserves after their hit with ""Roll to Me""off the ""Twisted"" CD. I feel like I'm gettig old but I'm only 32 damn it and I don't wanna have to search for these guys on adult contemporary radio. Del Amitri rocks! Granted their lyrics would go largely unappreciated on some of these moronic rock stations but come on. Band's like ""Matchbox 20"" and ""3rd Eye Blind"" really stink in comparison with these guys. It annoys me to see Del passed over for these trendy B.S. bands. They get all the air-play in what should be Del Amitri's place. These guys are an original great bluesy rock'n'roll band. They still sound hard edged yet smooth and very warm with an impeccable feel for catchiness (if that's a word) on this CD. I wish I could say something other than the obvious... Del Amitri is probably the best band, lyrically, vocally and musically, with the best all around songs, for their type of music (timeless)."
3,A subpar effort from a favorite band,"Have to agree with another reviewer: Change Everything and Waking Hours are great albums with a variety of tempos and poetic lyrics. Some Other Suckers Parade just never seems to get off the ground -- it just kind of drones along at the same pace throughout. I hope that the release of a ""best of"" this year gives the band a chance to rejuvenate and pump some of the old energy back into their sound; they sound a bit tired on this album."
1,Doobie Brothers Live at Hawaii,I was really disappointed with this DVD. The sound quality and video quality made we remember what life was like in the 50's with television. I would not recommend this for anyone. A total waste of money.
2,"Horrible recording, bad interviewer","As an avid Bon Jovi fan, I was greatly dismayed to hear this interview cd. The british interviewer didn't know anything about the band, and all he talked about was Jon, as if he was the only one there. It was so bad it was funny. They were laughing at the kind of questions he was asking. It was cute to hear Jon's voice though, when he was young. Half of the cd was actually inaudible. It sounded like the microphone was on the other side of the room, and there was tons of static. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it is incomprehensible. The interviewer actually calls Jon, ""Jonbon"" at first. If you are a real fan, you won't get this...it's pretty sickening."
2,Could have been better,"Simply not enough of Amy Weber in the film. In the scenes she was in she looked lovely, but I was hoping to see more. Anyone hoping to see Weber get down and dirty will be disappointed."
2,Great For Daily Guidance,"This deck is very simple but great for the individual seeker for daily inspiration or guidance. It lacks as far as using it in Professional Readings IMO, but still an alright deck."
3,"I prefer the ""Messages From the Angels"" deck........","While I do like this deck, I much prefer working with the Messages From the Angels deck, as I feel that I get more detail from that one. I have found that the other deck has been very accurate in providing information, and am using it to guide me frequently in my decisions. I am now using both decks, but use this one more for meditative thought and the other for readings."
4,,"I was impressed with how quickly this product was shipped to me. It does work, but for some reason it doesn't completely eliminate my body odor even though I've followed the directions. I'm thinking it might have been because I was sick when I first started using the product"
3,Fairly Good Product,"This is only a ""good product"". Nothing special regarding effect, but like the spray bottle feature. Would I buy again? Due to shipping costs, I would only buy if it was in commonly local stores."
5,the best,"I've been using Thai crystal deodorant for almost 2 yrs and it's the best purchase I've ever made, hands down. When using regular deodorant, I still smelled, but not with Thai. I can go for 3 to 4 days without rewashing my underarms, (because they don't smell) and just apply the Thai and theres never any odor. I can now wear my tops 2 to 3 times without odor, and wash them because they're dirty, not because they have B.O. I've only tried the spray, but I think I'll order a stone and try it out as an alternative, it would be easier to travel with. It's very economical because it lasts and lasts, and it has all natural ingredients, nothing wierd that will harm you. Try it, you won't be sorry!"
1,annoyed collector of the genre,"I LONGED for this show to be eventually released on dvd and here the first series is now available here to download or whatever the correct term is for this new craze.Not fair guys! I have been collecting old tv shows avidly for almost two years and knowing that dvd is being faded out, I am still saddened that shows such as this are being released here but the older guys like myself cant get to own them on dvd!!! Pllllllllleeeeeeeeease continue to release these shows on dvd untill its demise as that is where the true fanbase and the true monetary gain still is for a product of this sort. An Angry and very frustrated collector."
4,Adding To My CD Collection,"Just adding to my CD collection of The Bangles - this 1 has a few on it that other albums don't. A couple of favorites on here, & a couple that I hadn't heard before."
5,One of Tom Holland's Best Films,"This film is over looked and recently was redone, poorly. This one is classic and captures the 80s style. There are several cheesy effects but the overall composure of the entire film is excellent. The best scene is the one with a very young and pretty Amanda Bearse (her first role) being seduced by the vampire (Sarandon) in a Disco. The lighting and scene is to die for. Roddy McDowall also never really got credit for this role properly. His role is very well done. And some of the lines are quite funny. It mixes horror and comedy in the best possible ways. Rent it and see. Colin Farrell is cute but could never play the kind of character as well as Chris Sarandon did in this version. Finally the role of Charlie is much better portrayed by William Ragsdale , very sexy and attractive I must say. Again this film and many actors were over looked at that time."
5,One of those classic vampire flicks - 80's style,"Yeah, it's cheesy in some places, campy in others, but, in all, it's a movie you find yourself enjoying more every time you watch it.And I thought I was the only one who thought Chris Sarandon was extra hot here. If vampires look like him, I'm a willing victim! :-) (Tom Cruise, eat your heart out!)Other reviews give a detailed analysis of the plot so no need to rehash it here. If you're looking for a good and enjoyable vampire flick 1980's style (complete with the spiky hair and cheesy club music), this is the movie for you.I just can't believe it's been nearly 20 years since the film's release. But, even after all that time, it's still got it."
3,Don't buy from this guy,"This is a great movie, but I would not pay that much for it. Like I have seen posted previously, wait til it is available wider. Don't throw away your money. This isn't ebay."
5,There Are No Such Things As Vampires Fruit Cake !,"How Can You Not Love This Movie It Has EveryThing You Need That Makes For A Good Movie Peter Vincent The Great Vampire Killer, Evil Ed, And A Modern Day Vampire GQ At That, Chris Sarandon is Real Good In This movie It's Too Bad They Killed Him Off Because I Think That If He Was In The Sequel It Wouldn't Have Sucked So Bad Or Even Had Evil Ed In It, It Would Have Really Been Better He Really Was funny In This movie, Very Good Price To Here On Amazon This Is A Very Good 80's Movie"
4,Frightenly Fun,"I actually have never seen Fright Night until recently on American Movie Classics and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Although Roddy McDowell looks pretty silly with his hair and eyebrews being covered in white powder he still brings a lot of charm and humor to the film. He has a lot of fun scenes as a Horror film star/vampire slayer. Chris Sarandon (Child's Play) is very good as well as the head vampire. If you liked other modern vampire flicks like The Lost Boys and From Dusk Till Dawn check out Fright Night. It is funny, sexxy and even sometimes pretty damn scary."
4,Good horror from a bad decade,"In the middle of a decade swarming with maniacs chopping their way through victims came this strong modern vampire tale. Teen-ager Charlie has seen a coffin being carried in next door and young women have been turnign up dead. When Charlie begins to believe his neighbor is the real thing, he calls in late night horror host Peter Vincent in the hopes of stopping the vampire. The story was well written, some of the old vampire cliches are there, but not in the same old way like the crucfix tht does not effect the vampire because Peter Vincent needed to believe for it to work. The visuals are great, there is gore, but fortunately it is not overdone. Roddy McDowell was a great choice as the vampire killer. The few scenes of him as a movie vampire slayer were a hoot. Chris Sarandon is a very suave vampire, certainly one of the best vampires in a modern setting. This is certainly one of the strongest horror films of the 1980's."
4,A brilliant soundtrack for a quirky & fun film,"The film was brilliant in an unassuming & lighthearted way....from a seemingly lame premise, it gained points due to splendid emotional texture and some strong performances....Now, in terms of the music....I loved the recurring theme during segments of the film....had never heard of the composer before...was delighted to see that there was a soundtrack...highly recommend it if you enjoy melodic music...Ola.."
3,Tried both this and Similasan Eye Drops #3 Computer Eyes,"I have very dry eyes and need to work in front of computers. I tried both this and Similasan Eye Drops #3 Computer Eyes at the same time. I found GenTeal is harder to apply to eyes (need to look at the mirror) and it is easy to cause the blurry vision after applied. I have to keep wiping out the excessive gel around my eyes to get rid of the blurry vision. The Similansan Eye Drops performs much better and much more convenient. That's my own experience of comparing two of them.I didn't look closely to their ingredients so I couldn't comment on that.If you have better product suggestions, please kindly let me know. I will be much appreciated. :)"
4,Addicting,"The only time I saw the movie, I was a little disappointed - it had been a cult anti-war hit in the '60's, but I thought some of the asylum inmates were coy stock characters, and the war invading their town was mostly comic, not very threatening.That said, I did pick up the cast album shortly after the show came out and found so much pleasure there. It's a very gentle ensemble show with some enchanting music. Not having seen the original or the revival (at the Goodspeed), I can only guess why it didn't succeed, but that hasn't stopped me from listening again and again to this work. When it came out on CD, I couldn't stop myself from buying it."
4,Perfect For Pre-school,"Teaching English at a Christian-founded Japanese pre-K, I have an opportunity to share simple concepts. These little stickers were a perfect reward at the end of my lesson. My kids loved the happy faces, bright colors and a chance to repeat the name of the fruit. Nice little teaching tool and reward. My only recommended improvement would be to make them scented according to their fruit, however that's also what imaginations are for. :)"
3,If you're REALLY into Dylan.,"Unless you are so into Dylan you just can't miss anything, I wouldn't recommend this book. This author gets really out there, perhaps trying to be prophetic or mysterious like Dylan himself. I learned a few things I didn't know. It's more a psycho - cultural - spiritual - abstract muse on the times and how the song fit the changes of the times than anything else. I had the sense the author may have been a bit high when he wrote it."
1,Greil Marcus should not be allowed to read let alone write anymore books.,"This book is more about Greil Marcus than it is about Bob Dylan. Marcus is always pretentious, long-winded and under foot in his writing, and he is at his absolute worst here. If you were to randomly choose a book about Dylan, you couldn't do worse than this one. One star, and even that is too generous."
5,very happy,Very happy with this product. Its just what our office needed and it was delivered quickly. The scale is easy to set up and use. I recommend this product and the seller.
5,Something for a first/second timer..great!,This is a Great book for someone who is visiting Europe and planning to visit europe. There are several cost saving info as well as tools to help you plan a trip based on your budget and likes/dislikes.
4,Europe for Dummies,This book was very helpful when studying up on Europe. The manner in which it is writing is very entertaining and easy to understand.
4,Europe for Dummies,This book was exactly as it was represented in the description. I am using it to help me plan an upcoming trip. I received it sooner than expected from the seller.
3,Still worth a watch,"Govinda gives a damn good performance. Jackie is just about okay. Aishwariya is nice but Namrata steals the show from Aishwariya. Okay, she's not as good looking as her sister Shilpa but she can act.Still worth a watch"
4,Watch out for the little people,Most of the products manufactured under this name are misrepresented on the packaging. If you look at the pictures of the product all the kids are shrunk! You must really look at the dimensions (not sure if they are accurate) to get an idea of how big (or rather small) the product actually is. Dont be fooled---because I was. Is this legal?????
4,Good story,"I read this at the recommendation of a friend and enjoyed the story very much. Whenever I read about the difficulties the early settlors of the United States faced, I feel appreciation for their struggles and their incredible stamina in trying to survive. Those struggles are well depicted in this story. The main character, Analisa, is a woman who has survived a horrible tragedy. She is a strong, clever and hardworking woman.I feel that the romance between Analisa and her husband is quite lovely. My preference for sexual scenes is that they be left to one's imagination. There are a few explicit scenes in the book but they are not offensive. That said, the growing love between the couple makes for an especially enjoyable read."
3,Suflower,"Good book, the story was excellent and well told. Some parts seemed outlandish, but she was able to pull it all together in the end. Sorry, but the spelling and editing were poorly done and very distracting."
3,Not very durable,"I bought this bottle opener a couple of years ago, even though it's pricy, assuming that it would last longer than others I had. The aluminum bottle openers get chewed up after only a few uses, and so they can best be described as ""disposable"".Although this opener is quite sturdy on the opening side, the key chain connector is rather weak. After a couple of years bouncing around in my pocket, the tiny screw holding the swivel connector sheared off. A friend was able to repair the opener, by boring a new hole and screwing in new hardware. Given the high price of the opener, and the time involved in fixing it, this opener isn't worth it."
4,It Keeps Gettting Better and Better,This is the best of the series with Natalie Teeger. My favorite is the Wedding. I love Monk It is simply the best. If you are a true Monk you will get this DVD.
4,Monk - Season Four,I had to wait for awhile for shipping but it eventually arrived in about 14 business days.
4,Spoiler warning,"Note that the ""extras"" contain massive spoilers for Episode 13.Be careful not to view ""The Monk Writing Process"" and share myexperience."
5,Capture this entertainment while you can,"Monk's character continues to develop as his adventures continue. I still can't guess who done it. Funny, intriguing, warm. Makes one feel good about life."
1,Not worth the price,"My son was dying to have this toy. Being my only one, I decided to buy it for him. The shipping was fast and no problems with the delivery. However, the product itself, is flimsy, cheap and not worth $[...] plus $[...] (shipping) that I paid. Once we received it, we started to take it out of the box, and a couple of small pieces fell out of the box. It turned out to be broken pieces.The plastic used, is obviously a cheap type and it started to lose its shape and bend.I would not recommend this product for the price. Please note, this review HAS NO negative comment regarding the seller. Only towards the workmanship of the product."
2,cage wrestling ring,"it simply fell apart. the cage did not stay together as well as the sidesmy son wanted this so bad and he cant play with anything but the inside ring, nothing snapped together . piece of crap, seriously. and how wouldi return it? they make it too hard as it comes from a third party???"
5,Awesome,Great showing of a true legend. Editing takes a bit of getting used to but the disc captures a great performer doing his best.
2,A Legend but...,"No doubt the man was a genius as this dvd shows but this dvd has some problems: video quality is dodgy ranging from passable to poor. The sound also has serious problems: weird left and right fading and a general dated muddy sound quality. Despite the fact that it was remastered in 5.1, I don't hear it. To compound things, we don't get entire full performances rather edited ones. I was hoping this disc would have the entire performances without all the backstage musings/footage. If you want to hear the real show, buy the cd instead and skip this dvd."
5,motion made easy,this book is for anyone who feels overwhelmed by motion and its numerous applications. the easy to follow tuturials are what i needed to finally figure out this program.
4,as described!,"Works prefect. This replacement blade is the same blade as the wahl Sterling 4, Mag, and Echo. Its a universal blade so don't be fooled by the name.I personally have the Sterling 4 trimmers, but the only difference between the 4 of them is the coloring. I always end up getting a replacement blade for some other one of the four! But its the same specs!The blades them self can 'bite' when being used around ears where the skin is softer and thinner. I'm a hairstylist, so I use them a lot. But they are BY FARRRR my favorite pair of trimmers! light weight and very quite."
3,XX/XY,"I have never written a movie review, so please bear with me as I try to do some justice to this film.I really like Mark Ruffalo,and I think he is ready to break out and become the leading man that he is capable of being. This film didn't do that for him.He is caught up in a film that doesn't allow his character to grow and develope into a mature person.His friends from college have moved on with their lives and years later Mark crosses paths with them and he is ready to take up with them where they left off,however this doesn't work for them.He hasn't learned a thing about love and commintments.He is like a little kid that can't decide what candy bar to buy. This film is rated R,but at times during the movie I get the feeling that it boarders on soft porn. If you like Mark Ruffalo,this film is worth watching at least once,just keep the kids away from it."
3,The bad polyamory movie,"This movie is well acted and has an interesting story, but I keep wanting to slap the male character upside the head for being an idiot. I think of this as being the movie about how not to do polyamory. The characters are often not honest with themselves about how they feel, they use sex as a weapon against those they love and they often have hidden agendas that they refuse to reveal to the other participants in the relationship.I'm left feeling at the end that nobody has really successfully communicated what they want to anybody else. There is a sort of strange ""The Age of Innocence"" style denouement in which everybody sort of settles for what's socially acceptable instead of trying for what they really want."
5,a spouse that hears no other,my husbend likes to lisen to ramon ayala he has lots of his music my son how is 11 yaers old asked for an acordian for his b.day and gotte he sead he is going to be raman ayala #2 sens his name is raman . welike to lisen to ramon ayalas music . myfavoret is omenaje a ramon ayala.
5,A Great Date Flick!,"Everyone's favorite fanged fiend has awoken from his crypt, and he's thirsty! The horror story's been told numerous times, but the material - and the Count - get an infusion of fresh blood for the millennium with Goth flavor, high-tech gadgetry and a dose of Vitamin C (in her feature debut). And who better to take a stab at updating this horror classic than Wes Craven (of Scream trilogy fame), the creepiest guy in showbiz!"
3,Dracula 2000,"Gerard Butler is a striking figure as Dracula. While not in my personal top ten of his movies, I did enjoy the movie."
3,Dracula 2000,"I went to see this movie with my dad when it came out, and we weren't very disappointed. I thought it gave a fresh twist to the ...-master himself.For what it is ( a dumb horror movie, sent out make a few extra million dollars for the movie company) it is pretty good. I mean, we aren't talking Gone With The Wind here, but if you have an extra $5, it is well worth it.There is plenty of special effects, and if you don't want a movie that makes you think too much, and you just want to jump out of your chair a few times, you have come to the right place.There are plenty of familiar faces in there, (i.e. Vitamin C, Jennifer Espisito, and Omar Epps)and they hold their own pretty well.The best scene is with the young vampire hunter and the she-pires. You can really see the quality special effects when Jennifer Espisito and Vitamin C jump off the top of the building and then saunter their ways over to him. It is visually stunning.Check this one out for a good Saturday night scare!"
3,This movie sucks- literaly!,"Okay, I must admit that I only watched this movie because Gerry Butler is in it, and I have been completely obsessed with finding out what other film roles he has been in since I saw Phantom of the Opera. I'm only giving it three stars because besides Butler, the acting was just terrible and I didn't like the ending. The story line was very interesting though, so I don't mind owning this movie. The special effects were incredible! I think the next movie I see Gerry in I'll be expecting his eyes to turn blood red. *Spooky*"
1,The worst Dracula movie ever,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The plot is bad, the characters are week, the acting is absurd. The idea that Dracula is really Judas is stupid, and so is the ending. Please save your money, there are plenty of good Dracula movies. Bram Stokers being my favorite."
3,"An O.K. Movie, but still not the perfect dracula movie.","First off, I would like to say that I have read recent reviews on here and it is obvious, the reviewers are mostly females and they rate this movie tops mainly because of Gerald Butler, and himself being a cutie pie, Go Figure. And then they down the Vampire Girls in the movie, because, Go Figure, the reviewer is a female. OK...so, I'm a male, and I think the Vampire girls are cutie's(And of course Mary too), wish one would bite me. And for Gerald Butler, his an ok guy, I do admit his acting in this movie was tops, and of course the movie itself was tops. Its not the best rounded Dracula movie, but so far its the newest one. The movie did have some bad plots in it, but overall it was a well rounded movie. So if you have not seem this one at all, I do believe its worth watching once or twice.Oh, and to the female reviewers, no hard feelings, it's natural to act that way."
1,DEFFINATELY BUY IT!!!,I shouldnt be the only poor schmuk who had to sit through it! It was excellent until the last 1/2 hour. I despise it when a movie sets a great premise and then ends horribly.I really thought this one would go the distance but the end was so campy in comparison to the rest of the movie!
2,SPOILER: Why do vampires always become christians?,"This film is a modern adaptation of the original tale in the ranks of the recent ""Romeo + Juliet."" The acting is mediocre and the believability simply plain. Near the end of the movie, the story strays into new territory where Dracula is actually Judas (the Biblical character who betrayed Jesus) and can only die by hanging and that must occur at sunrise. The ""surprise ending"" is something that both athiests and christians alike will find annoying and pathetic. As far as choosing this movie or another, I recommend watching ""End of Days"" or ""Stigmata,"" as both can be classified in the same genre and style, yet actually succeed in pulling off the believability factor. Especially the devil character in ""End of Days,"" which is (in my opinion) hysterically played by Gabriel Byrne."
2,THIS IS TERRIBLE,"GOD. SERIOUSLY, HOW CAN PEOPLE WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT WAS EXTREMELY BORING. DRACULA WAS TOTALLY WASHED UP INTO A TOTALLY LAME VERSION AND THE REST OF THE CAST WAS JUST HORRIBLE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE. IT REALLY IS HORRIBLE. I GAVE IT 2 STARS GENEROUSLY"
3,An unusual approach to the Dracula Legend,"While I see the possible link between living on blood as a vampire, and the ""Blood of Life"" within Jesus the Nazarene; I was disappointed on the acting overall. The story was interesting, but the way it was presented made it B-list at best. I don't really recommend it to others, especially if you are a die-hard fan of Bram Stoker and his idea of Dracula."
3,Not as dumb as I thought it would be.,"This movie actually wasn't all that bad. I actually enjoyed most of the movie and only at the end did it start seeming a bit ridiculous. Like when Van Helsing's daughter ran into the cemetery to get away from Dracula- hello lady, that's his natural territory for crying out loud!But this movie wasn't just another dumb teen movie. There's actually depth to this movie, and the actors aren't all that bad. I enjoyed the new twist of Van Helsing keeping Dracula down in a vault, and I thought Dracula and Mary were two very believable characters. One thing I loved the most about this movie was the fast one they pulled on us pessimistic movie critics- which was making us assume Van Helsing was going to be with Mary until the end- but then in the middle of the movie he dies- brutally too. I liked that. Bravo Wes Craven. Once more Wes has made a horror movie that I would be happy to watch again soon."
1,This was horrible,I actually returned the book and took a loss because this book was neither worth the paper it was printed on nor was it anything that should ever be sold...EVER. I apologize to the author because I feel sorry that they ever let you print this worthless excuse for helpful materials. I will use my own techniques and know that it is much better than this.
1,Cheap plastic parts break easliy,"These valves were installed in all of our new toilets from Mansfield and they all have broken within 2 years. The cheap plastic used for the stop on top of the valve breaks and leaves your toilet running after every flush (when members of your family don't realize or say anything it will happen for a few days). I was able to epoxy them but can't image that will last more than 6 months.Don't buy this, if you need to replace an old flush valve, buy a nice dual flush valve kit for $7 more than this on amazon."
3,Wan and Bloodless,"First, let me state that I have a lot of respect for Ms. Ullman as an Essayist on computer technology and techie org behavior.Being a refugee from geekdom, THE BUG: A NOVEL accurately describes the technology and socio-dynamics of writing software in those bygone days. However, the novel is wan and bloodless. Ms. Ullman's prose is crisp and clean to read, but it fails to convey strong emotion. In particular, she misses the potential for the humor, ironic, puerile, or otherwise in the story.THE BUG: A NOVEL is a read that evokes in me a lot of nostalgia, but it is hardly, ""gripping, exciting, and compelling""."
2,boring book.,"The basic storyline of The Bug has potential, but Ullman does not do a good job making the storyline interesting. Many connections are never quite made, and her character's connection to the story is kind of lame. From a litereary viewpoint the book just isnt very good.If you are interested in programming, all of the programming talk will probably be interesting, but the basic storyline is very lacking. the ending is also pretty lame. all in all, i wouldn't recommend this book unless you're interested in programmning, and even then its a little bit of a snore. sorry ms. ullman."
5,Civil War Book Review,""". . . includes an assessment of the strategic importance of the campaign and summaries of the subsequent careers of the major players. Winschel's essays read well and show his firm grasp of the many facets of the Vicksburg Campaign. The book contains a number of excellent maps and numerous illustrations. Anyone interested in the topic will enjoy this addition to the literature."""
1,Thought it would be better,I read all the reviews on this book before I purchased it. I hoped it would be better coming from a Doctor who slams other doctors. She says all other doctors want to do is to put you on drugs to help your symptoms. But really that is all she suggests as well. She reccomends going on the pill to help a lot of the symptoms. What happens when you don't want to be on the pill and you want to get pregnant? The pill can actually cause some of the symptoms when used for long peroids of time. After years of trying I ended up getting pregnant by losing weight with diet and exercise. I was really not impressed by this book.
4,Tammy's Classic Country Christmas Album,"Recorded during her hayday with husband George Jones, this album presents classic Billy Sherill compositions, mixed with the gospel music that Tammy sang so well. ""Let's Put Christ Back Into Christmas"" ranks as one of her most heartfelt songs ever..."
5,GREAT QUALITY MUSIC,PEGGY LEE&QUINCY JONES IS Fantastic.HER Quality Vocals with Q's Lush Arrangements make this a must have.very solid&full of Quality.a Winner.
1,Instruction manual missing pages and several parts missing,"My two year old was so excited to get this bike! We noticed that the box had A LOT of packing tape on it, as though it had been opened previously. Once opened, we noticed that was not a ""parts"" section in the owners manual, then we noticed that several pages in the manual were repeated, then noticed that several pages were missing! The manual pages were as follows: 1, 2, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7,8,7,8, 11. There was no way we could put this together - and the pages that were present had parts shown that were not in the box!! We tried to call the company on the owner's manual, but they are only open M-F and we attempted to put this together on Saturday morning.... Pacific Cycle in Olney, IL. Only a message to call back M-F between 8-5. FRUSTRATING!! The bike seems like good quality, but getting it assembled is not possible. I will never order something like this again from Amazon."
5,Great Trike ...Great Price,"We got this bike for our 2 year son for his birthday. It's a great bike all around. You won't be disappointed with this bike.Reasons to buy :(1) The trike should not be tippy.(2) The tires should be made of rubber, not hard plastic.(3) Value - Great bike for a great price.(4) Style- great design look like a radio flyer"
4,Retro trike at a good price,"This is a cool looking, retro style trike that's a good value overall.The instructions included steps for all individual parts and pieces, but some of the sections I received were already put together. I'm not sure if this was intentionally done by the manufacturer or if I received someone's return that they had previously started to put together. To be sure it was put together correctly, I had to take everything apart and put it together again.Some of the thick red enamel paint was heavily chipped on the edges, so much that I imagine the metal will start to rust in those spots at some point.I'm glad the trike comes with rubber tires, but the smell of the rubber was so potent that it gave me a headache when I was putting the trike together.All in all, my experience wasn't perfect, but I am satisfied. It's an extremely cute trike and a good buy."
2,Buy mainly for nostalgia,"We bought 4 of these for our child care center and I was disappointed with plastic parts which don't hold and fairly lightweight metal. We need equipment that can stand some abuse, and this is definitely not for heavy use. Maybe for 1 kid only who just rides back and forth to church on Sundays."
1,great tricycle but not worth buying it,"I bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and my husband put it together for him. He had to keep fixing it and tighting up the screws but it still kept having problems so he had to buy new screws for the seat and the handles. But it still kept having problems, then my dad got tired of it and hammered some nails to the chair too so that it will quiet moving. NOW it is fine but if I knew how cheap the product was I would have never bought this. Next time if I am going to buy a new tricycle for anyone, I sure will not buy this one. It is not worth the price."
4,Creating Significant Learning Experiences,"I dropped the grad course I was taking that req'd this book; however, the book itself contains a lot of really terrific ideas and is easily understood."
1,Waste of my time and money,"It is clear that Michael Martin made up his mind that the Bible can't be trusted before even looking at the facts. I have read ""The Case for Christ"" and ""The Case for Christiantiy"" and those books are much more balanced and thought-provoking than this. It seems that Martin, like most critics of the Bible, are driven by a strange emotional desire to deny God. They are not driven by the pursuit of truth. The idea of God and Jesus BOTHERS them, to their very core. Why is that? Maybe they don't like the idea that we have someone bigger than us to answer to. Maybe they want to think we ourselves are the true gods of this world and our lives, and anything that threatens that position must be silenced. It is funny to me that these people tout themselves as being ""open minded"". Michael Martin is not. A more appropriate title for this book would be: ""I have already made up my mind, so don't confuse me with the facts."""
2,Poor fit,"The bottom portion of the cover fits well, protects the phone. The top cover did not allow the phone to close so it stayed lit up as it did not close all the way. I use the bottom part but tossed the top part. Clip part was garbage and way too big for its intended use, also tossed."
4,"Good, solid product - worth eating. Somewhat spicy.","First this product excels because it isn't loaded with nasty preservatives, chemicals or other nasty junk, just the good stuff. The meat itself is perfection, I haven't ever found any fat or hard bits, always just the right moisture and texture good quality tender meat. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I personally don't care for the spice they used (it is a powdered type and not hot enough for me.) It tastes good but isn't my favorite. If you aren't into inferno heat out of your food give this a try as you may just like it a lot!"
3,Jerked or Jerky,"Wasn't good, but wasn't bad. The main thing is that it doesn't have the nitrites the other jerky has and is all natural!"
2,A little gritty,"We eat jerky all the time- backpacking, for snacks, just a convenience food! This, however, had a different texture that we didn't like. We ate it, but wouldn't buy it again."
2,Very Disappointing,"As a Michael McDonald fan throughout the years, I would have expected something more listenable... this is not."
5,"If you're female, and you have a pulse, you'll like this","The concept is a bit screwy, but the acting is supreme. And the leading man is positively mouth-watering! There's a lot to like about this series, and every season does get progressively better/more sophisticated. It is acted so well, you do suspend your disbelief. Even if you don't like science fiction, treat yourself to a hero who isn't a macho jerk!"
5,An astounding story of man's inhumanity to man,"I saw this movie in the 70's when I was in my late 20's. I have never forgotten the impact it had on me. Max. Schell does not act the part of Goldman, he is Goldman. He takes his audience on a real roller Coaster ride, that has an ending like no other film I have ever seen. I normally do not watch movies about the Holocaust, but believe that everyone should see this movie. The book should be on every University reading list. What happened during the Holocaust must never be allowed to happen againFixer [VHS]"
1,"A disturbingly immoral ending to a breezy, amusing tale.","I enjoyed the first 90% of Mommy and the Murder,and I had begun to think I had discovered a newauthor in the mode of Susan Isaacs or JanetEvanovich--sassy and witty and intelligent.The denouement disturbed me so much I am nowwarning friends away from the book. Okay, so themotive for the murder is farfetched--- that wouldmerely disappoint me. However, like mostmystery fans, I have a deep need for justice inmy literature, especially in a book that is light intone and features the mother of a toddler asheroine. Justice is not served when a murdererwho kills merely for personal gain is allowed toescape punishment by a not-very-heroic heroineacting for her own personal gain. The murdervictim in this book was enough of a cad that Imight excuse both his murder and allowing themurderer to escape serious punishment, butnot for the motives cited.Mommy has moved on to solve more murders,but I will not be reading about them"
5,A Great Strap,"Nice, high quality product. The most impressive thing is that it is VERY easy to undo despite high loads that might normally cinch the loop too tight on itself. I have never had a problem getting it apart. They've designed this thing right."
4,Cats and More Cats,I ordered this for my granddaughter who loves stuffed animals especially cats. She has lots of stuffed and real cats. She loved this little orange and white cat. It fit perfectly with her collection.
5,Perfect Insight into the Man and His Music,"This video projects the true Sinatra of 1965 at his prime. Walter Cronkite performs an exceptional CBS interview behind the scene of the Sinatra Legend. The interview is candid and the performances exceptional. Check out the actual recording studio takes of ""It Was A Very Good Year"". He catches a 'clam' in the strings in the last four bars of the tune. The note ""...should have been a F#"". Did you hear it? No, but he did and he was right on!This is an excellent review of the Sinatra personality, charisma, and performance we love."
2,To collar a killer--not worth the time,"An unlikable protagonist and ridiculous scenarios of police ""procedures"" mar what could have been a good mystery/dog training tips book. What a waste."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this piece because of its size -- it is decidedly smaller than an inversion table or the ab lounge, both of which I have used with some satisfaction for stretching my back and relieving back pain. The ab lounge was by far the best, because I was able to do a full inverted ""u"" curve, in which neither feet nor hands were engaged. AHHH! that was wonderful. It was just too big for my small apartment. The inversion table was gigantic, as well and had its own issues. I thought this would be a great pared down version of the ab lounger. When inverted, however, my feet are still on the floor, or up in the air and I am unable to achieve the satisfying ""u"" curve where my spine is supported and the weight of my dangling limbs tractions my spine. Alas. My search for the perfect back stretcher continues."
4,Arab magick mixed with other sources,"My comments about this book are for experienced magicians: this book should present an interesting view on a way of working that is not considered by western magicians, with topics such as dihkr, science of the arabic letters, angelic contracts, and jinn-summoning.There is a lot of work that is arab'esque replacement for Golden Dawn style theurgy, of course the author has created this as a context for his own society, but in terms of innovation I would say that the above are the key contributions that make the working worthwhile."
3,Migraine is a migraine,Mirgraine is Oliver Sacks first book and not the best one for a general audience. It is more a scholarly dissertation on migraine and would be possibly interesting to a professional working with patients or a migraine sufferer. His later books are fantastic and enjoyable for people interested in brain science and psychology.
5,the best book on migraine,"This is very informative, scholarly and interesting at the same time. I read it and look at the illustrations and am amazed at how many of my life's experiences have been related to the migraine. The condition changes - or can change - throughout a lifetime. I had no idea."
3,Dowton Abbey Season 2,"I am very, very disappointed that this cd does not have closed captioning. I guess live and learn that you have to check this closely before ordering anything again.The story is fabulous but I am missing a lot of words. We just purchased a sound bar and maybe that will help."
1,This advertisement for this product is a lie,TThis bouncer is under 6 ft an seriously small I feel scammed save your money an buy one from Walmart.com. Not much bounce at all barely even fun for my four year Olds.
2,"Shows promise, but...","The music fan from NY has a good point that I believe was somewhat misinterpreted by tippinin44. While it is true that technique is something to be admired, jazz is not all technique. Ms. Sutton clearly has outstanding singing technique, but lacks the style of a Diana Krall or a Norah Jones. While the latter two do not have impeccable vocal technique, they convey their intended styles much more effectively.Ms. Sutton's first track, Route 66, is the best track on the album. The groove is entirely different from all other renditions of this particular song, and her vocals are tastefully restrained. The rest of the CD, however, is a virtual vocal free-for-all. Melodies are barely visible and forms are often lost. This is not nearly as bad as the fact that the performances are almost completely flat. It seems more that the musicians are going through the routine of making an album rather than giving serious thought to it or allowing themeselves to be lost in the music."
3,Something Cool,"Music is good, but! The recording for multichannel is below average. If you are into quality multi channel surround sound you will be disappointed with this SACD. I rate all my SACD's either A B or C for quality of sound and this is a ""C"""
2,Not as funny as I remembered it being,I got this since it was on sale and I remembered liking it when I was younger. Some of the jokes however seem forced and the custody/divorce plot seems a bit dark for a childrens movie.
4,Great Christmas Movie,have watched this movie over and over with the grandkids. and they want to watch it again so I got to go now.
4,Great movie,"This movie is wonderful. It may raise a question or two early from your kids if Santa exists, but overall it's a great movie, and fun for families of any age. Our kids 3, 5, and 6 loved it."
1,Disappointed No Movie,I will never use this company again! There was no movie burned on the DVD. It was sealed and looked new but was blank!
4,Great Christmas Movie,"Really fun, almost classic Christmas movie that reminds me of my own childhood! Well worth the $1.99. Merry Christmas to all!"
5,A classic in my home,This is the christmas movie that my dad and I would watch. It meant even more to me after my parents divorced. A great way to show a split family that can work together.
4,Good Christmasy fun,"This is a cute movie, and a must to show to the kiddies at Christmas/Yule time. A original story, and a great cast make this a holiday classic. Worth buying, highly recommended."
2,Not as advertised,"Although the DVD itself seems to be satisfactory, I was a bit disappointed with the box. It looked to me like it was photocopied on to a plain white box. One of the plastic clips that holds the disc in place was broken also."
5,Great to watch with grandkids.,Great Christmas Story about Santa Claus. Like the it involves a family man and his young son. The transition to the Santa Claus character is fun to watch.
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","Unfortunately, PJF's story in Dayworld can't live up to the concept of the world itself. The book is poorly paced, and while the various personae are interesting, none held my interest for even their stint as central figure."
3,good context but too many printing errors.,"a fair and good insight into conservative movement. however, i had a very hard time to continue reading because the missing "".""s above letters and at the end of sentences were too distracting. i am not sure if this edition was printed by a legitimate printing company."
1,Looking for an aggravating and time-consuming hobby? This is it!,"I've had this card for about one month so this is not a spur of the moment review. The documentation is almost non-existant. The software is very buggy. Sometimes the Scheduler runs and sometimes it doesn't. The TV listings sometimes refuse to update even though they download the new data. As for the recording hardware, it seemed to work pretty well when it would actually record, but suddenly two days ago it quit recording sound and I'm still at a loss as to why. You can watch TV with sound (although I bought it exclusively as a PVR), but it won't record sound. It will play sound while recording, but there is no audio in the saved file.I've been working with computers and PCs for some years, and this is the most annoying hardware I've encountered. It CAN work, but there seems to be no pattern as to WHEN it will work.(Yes, I have the latest software, OS, patches, etc.)"
5,Cool animated videos with ok music.,Pretty cool stuff here. Some great animated trips. Not all are great but the best ones are unforgettable.
2,disappointed,I wore these earrings for one day and the back was so loose on the earring that it was lost. I would not recommend this product.
2,earrings were too small and mismatched,"The color of these earrings was gorgeous and they were quite sparkly. However, they were NOT 6mm in diameter, and they were different sizes. They were each closer to 5mm, but one was larger than the other. Needless to say, I have sent them back."
5,The best cleansing cream,"I used Albolene cream over 40 years ago. I am much older now and knew this cleansing cream would really help my skin. I searched the local stores to no avail and am so happy that I found it on Amazon.It is just as wonderful as I remembered, so many years ago."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this CD based on some of the great reviews above, and it just doesn't live up. There's no fire, there's no originality - mostly just straight 12 bar blues, the vocals are very weak, and the guitar work is, well, sloppy.Double Trouble, Wynans, Musselwhite, don't embarass themselves, but there's not much they can do to salvage this mess.If this is the ""album of the year"", then I'm Elvis, skulking around the gates at Graceland.Go buy some Delbert, or some Coco Montoya, instead.Now, where's the link I click to sell used CD's??"
3,"terrible sound, decent performance","Terrible sound quality is obvious - you'd better have book with you while watching. Despite great names, there are no great performances - except, probably, Natasha. Decent rendition of the great Chekhov's play, but I definitely prefer taped Broadway 1965 (?) performance. BTW revolutionary ""International"" at the very end is, mildly put, not a good idea."
5,Mean-ass Mississippi blues,"There's been a voodoo shortage in the Mississippi hills since bluesman Junior Kimbrough died two years ago. But Robert Belfour evokes some of the same dark, roiling spirits with the slithery guitar lines of Bad Luck and other numbers on this debut CD."
1,The Late Clara Beame,"Perhaps many years ago this might have been a thriller, just not today. I love Taylor Caldwell books but this one is good for maybe a 12 year old reader and I'm not too sure but that a 12 year old today would be too sophisticated for this book."
4,Captivating,"I felt the need to point out that this is not some cheap direct-to-video ripoff of ""Shark's Tale"" and ""Finding Nemo."" This movie, correctly titled ""Help! I'm a Fish"" was produced and released in Europe, originally in Danish in 2000 and later in English, in 2001. It has taken it a long time to come to America, and to see it retitled and with such an awful cover makes me cry. I own the British release of this DVD as well as the original soundtrack, and I love them both. I *highly* recommend this film, which is intelligent and emotional and intense in places. I was captivated from beginning to end on my first viewing."
3,Interesting,"Well, I'd always wanted to see this, but as I live in America...So, I bought the DVD. It was interesting, kind of cute. The songs/music were strange to me. I don't know if it's a cultural difference or what, but it just wasn't my kind of music. Alan Rickman is great as Joe (the whole reason I wanted this movie), and surprisingly, his song was the only one I liked. I also would have sworn that Aqua sings the final song, but apparently I'm wrong.This film is good for people of all ages, and if you like cartoons, you'll probably like this one."
4,fun summer read,"The Nannies was a fast, fun read, not much different from the ritzy Gossip Girl series. The Nannies is about three different girls who come to LA for different nanny positions. Lydia, who has spent the recent years of her life in the Amazon, wrangling any magazines she could get her hands on, jumps at the chance to be the nanny for her cousins, children of her famous tennins-playing aunt. Kylie, who grew up in an invisible small town in Wisconsin, tries out for Platinum Nanny, a reality TV competition to become the nanny for the bratty kids of their even more bratty pop-star mother, Platinum. Finally, there's Esme, who grew up in the gang-filled, poverty-struck Echo Park, a little distance from LA. When Esme goes to the mansion of the famous Goldhagens where her parents are the help, she is convinced to be the Goldhagen's nanny for their adopted Colombian twins, Easton and Weston, also as a translator between the twins' Spanish and the Goldhagens' English. Enjoy!"
2,Vague,"I give 2 stars because I do think it is admirable for someone to write about their personal life and expose their vulnerable side in that way. Even so, this book took me a long time to get through. It was the kind of book I put down for long periods and picked up later because I wanted to see what its point would be. It kind of just went along and eventually I was at the end, but I still didn't really see a story; just a lot of tangents that didn't fit too coherently together. Parts of the story even seemed to contradict each other and the people in the book weren't described very well. Even though she did endure some significant abuse, the story mostly comes off as spacey and even manages to seem whiny and overly sentimental. A better memoir about a dysfunctional family, is The Liar's Club by Mary Karr."
3,Different,This is more like standing in front of the machine VS a Pinball game for the game unit. It was not exactly what I was looking for. I wanted it to be like pinball games normally are on the PSP. This made you feel like you were in the arcade.Over all it is not really bad. It was just not comfortable for me to play. It made me a tad dizzy. It took a bit to figure out how to view it easiest. I ended up trading my copy in at the local game store.
4,just pick it up,"listen, if you like pinball, have a psp, and roughly $20 you can't go wrong with this game."
1,Smells awful!,This product smelled so unbelievably bad.....I have a hard time believing this smell is made from anything remotely similar to citrus. Yuk yuk and more yuk. Sure the bunny wouldn't go near it but it made our living room toxic to breathe. Never again!
1,Big disappointment,"My cat was able to chew through this in one day, and the smell is so awful. It repelled me, but did nothing to deter him. He just bit right through it, and the cord easily came out of the sleeve whenever I moved it. Very disappointed. Way overpriced and a waste of money."
4,A fine adventure,"I am relatively new to Judge Dee, buti am thoroughly enchanted by the characters, the mysteries, and by van Gulik's portrayal of old China. The Red Pavilion is racy and thrilling and enjoyably haunting."
1,Its a knock off,"Its a plain disk with no logo or any imprint, its a knock off. Not as pictured. There is no logo on it."
1,"Not as described, received generic coil no writing or anything","This coil came in no Bounty Hunter Logo or anything....basic black GENERIC COIL AND I WAITED FOR THIS , WHAT A DUMMY"
4,Good First Nutcracker CD,"This is a great beginers CD for the Nutcracker. It has all the main pieces you have heard before. The horns have a great clarity, and this is the type of CD that sounds good even through your autos CD player. I go to see the Philadelphia Ballet Company perform the Nutcracker ever year and this cd is a good warm up for the week before, especially for someone you may be bringing to see the Nutcracker for the first time.Also you can't beat the price, great CD to give to your college kids for Christmas even they will enjoy it.There are better versions but this is a great starter CD."
2,Not So Pleased...,"I purchased these based on the reviews and description, but was so disappointed. The settings were fine, but the stones are very light-colored, very clouded and have very visible flaws. They look much more like Jade, not emeralds. I have ordered other similar items from Amazon and have been pleased, but not with these. I really wanted a pair this size, but will be sending these back. Hope you have better luck!"
4,My Wife loves them,"They are kind of light in color, which is normal for man made emeralds I guess - my wife loves them though!"
2,just ok,"the prong is soo thin. its ok i dont really like it, i wont recommend it to others tho,,,it look cheap also..."
5,great resource book,"Not only is this a wonderful book for the coffee table it is detailed in materials, techniques, and decorations of baskets from around the world. Easilly identifiable photos of baskets as well as great photos of the weavers. Recommend this book to anyone interested in weaving, baskets, and ethnic handicrafts."
4,Good Jude Deveraux book,"I have read several of Jude's books in the past, and I have probably read this one almost half a dozen times. I really like it. It is a good romance book with some sultry parts to it. It is one of my favorite books to read. I believe another top one of Jude's of mine was ""A Knight In Shining Armor."""
2,The Forgettable.,I don't remember anything about the video. But I do remember renting something with Carol Baker. It must not havebeen very interesting.
2,Cheap Chinese stainless,This is the cheapest camp stainless silverware I have seen. pieces bend very easily. The fork tines weren't staight when I received this. I don't plan on using it.
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny",What a funny guy Taylor is!We all laughed until we were crying. Our 11 yr old daughter couldn't even catch her breath during the last act on stage with audience participation. Clean jokes - delivery was hysterical and we find ourselves mimicking him now around the house. 5 year old wasn't interested at all and she loves Mr. Bean - so I would say ages 8 and up would get enjoyment out of this show. We plan on using it for youth group activites at church.... the kids will love it!
3,Entertaining!,"Another great expressive book of a almost unheard of artist. If like me you stumble across this book you must pick it up and read it as I ensure you, you will be pleased. Not only just for the brilliant, modern pictures contained within but for the amazing life and work that Brzeska belived in and lived for. A must for all budding artists."
5,Nothing comes close!,"This is without question the best licorice you will ever try! I've tried Kookaburra which I did not like at all and Panda which tastes great but not the best texture and many others that just can't come close to this absolutely perfect licorice! Best real licorice flavor from a natural product with the perfect chewy but not sticky texture. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!"
3,Introducing Mr. Steve Bell...,"Any scene that Steve Bell was in had fire and crackling excitement.I was vastly disappointed in everyone and everything else. Except for the ""bare knuckle fighting,"" the story has been made and remade over and over and over. All of the Actors (except Mr. Bell) gave all they had to give to a story and script that was commonplace and overworked. The dialog was ""expected"" and there was little happening that inspired any continued interest for watching.If you haven't guessed by now, I think the time spent watching this film could have been better used, except for finding a new Actor who came across as ""real"" and comfortable in his role.In my humble opinion, Mr. Bell was the only reason to finish watching this flick till the end. I'll look forward to seeing him again in other productions that might showcase his natural style and talents.Good going Mr. Bell!!!"
1,Phooey!,"Obnoxious characters, unremitting self indulgence, and a nonsensical plot make this movie a real dog!"
1,Demo quality throughout,"This is a collection of demos, not a finished album. It's a 25% effort when compared to Express or even Seventh Dream. Too Much Choice would have been a great B-side for Express, along the lines of Holiday on the Moon. Is the mix really clipped? It sounds that way (harsh) in mp3, but that could just be the compression. Life (Malibu) is a nice soundtrack song. Bland but nice. The rest of the album is just throw-away to me."
2,Wrong Turn,"I really wanted to like this, but I didn't. Enough with the electro already. I can hear that everywhere these days. However, what I'm not hearing is stuff like what can be found on ""Express,"" which is by far L&R's best effort. Back to the basics gentlemen--or bow out gracefully."
4,Could havebeen stronger,"Honestly, this album doesn't deserve 4 stars. 3 or 3.5 would be more accurate. But L&R is far too talented to release a 3 star album, and I'm sure this one will grow on me. It tries to be ambient, but falls so far short of ""Hot Trip to Heaven"". ""R.I.P. 20c."" is an excellent tune, surpassed only by ""My Drug"". ""Resurection Hex"" will be the best known track off this album, which is unfortunate, as it is rather uninspired compared to many other songs off of ""Lift"". L&R continues a fantastic tradition by having the first track on the album an instrumental (or softer melody in Sweet F.A.), and ""Lift"" is the best first track so far."
2,Crappy made DVD,"The way this DVD was copied, it was very difficult to get the regular movie to play. When I put it in, it kept playing the commentary, it was not obvious how to get out of the commentary section. This must be a boot-leg."
5,GOSPEL CONCERT,THE SEGO BROTHERS & NAOMI ARE SOMETHING WONDERFUL. I OWN 1 CD OF THEM BUT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE SONGS BY THEM IF I KNOW ABOUT IT. I LISTEN TO THAT CD EVERYDAY WITHER ITS ON MY PC OR IN ONE OF MY OWN PLAYERS.LAST BUT NOT LEAST. THE SONGS CAN BE TOUCHING. I'M NOT KIDDING TRY IT YOU'LL LOVE THEM TOO.
3,Pleasantly freaky chiller,"I found THE BOOGEYMAN a lot scarier when I was younger, but it still holds a good amount of chills and atmosphere 20 years later. It combines THE EXORCIST with HALLOWEEN as a young woman, whose younger brother murdered their mother's lover, is possessed by the dead man and seeks revenge. It makes great use of dark corners and turns ordinary household items like scissors and mirrors into suspenseful instruments of death. Skip its two rip-off sequels, BOOGEYMAN 2 & RETURN OF THE BOOGEYMAN, but definitely take a look at this moody fright film."
5,Really great,"I stumbled accross this by accident in a video rental store a few years ago, with no prior affinity for Rushdie.The book is an insightful and unpretentious short essay that explores what makes The Wizard of Oz emotionally important to viewers. It's written in a personal voice: Rushdie retraces how the various characters and scenes struck him at different times in his life, how certain things made sense and others never did to him. It's very unusual and one of my absolute favorite pieces of writing on any subject."
4,Low-budget awesome controller,"This keyboard works fine for me. I'm not a sound engineer, just a home studio hobbyist. I use Pro Tools LE to do most of my recordings. I also program MIDI parts on that software using the pencil (note by note!). So I decided to get a controller keyboard to facilitate the job. The semi weighted keys let you program different velocities when playing creating a more interesting and human effect (especially on cymbals)Difficult to program? I don't think so. I downloaded the Enigma software from the M-Audio website and the job was automatically done. Programming keys on a Mac is piece of cake, just drag and drop! BFD can also program the keys in auto mode. Don't be fooled for those who are saying is complicated to assign sound to the keys.Low price, great specs... it's up to you."
1,"A pre-cursor to the ""Crying Game"" - sort-of!","A strange movie, centered around a gay/ transvestite nightclub (which ought to have alerted me - for what was to come!). Hamilton-ish in the cinematography, hazy edges and soft lighting dull the senses before the big moment - the rather beautiful lead singer - who is not quite what she seems. Nor the gender that you expect! The full frontal making you doubt your sanity and your ability to judge male/female appearances. You can miss this one......"
2,had the potential,this movie had the potential to be a great movie. it failed. the plot seems great but it's just average for a murder mystery. i liked it up until the ending and then i was like what the hell just happenned. i don't get it.
1,"Twist, twist, twist,..ah screw it","I rented this movie thinking it could not be that bad seeing as Samuel L. Jackson and J.T were in it. Boy was I wrong. This movie is so bad. The most damaging aspect are the plot twists. I like a good twist just as much as the next man but in this movie there is a twist about every 15-20 minutes and they don't make any sense. At the end of the movie i was lost and that would not be a bad thing if the twists were logical but they were not and so i did not care. Towards the end of the movie it seems the director or writer or whoever just said screw it and gave up on making an ending that would explain everything that happened in the movie. Its very bad. Don't buy this movie, rent it at best.ALSO: I enjoyed the movie ""wild things"" because the twists all fit so maybe watch that instead."
2,Basic... WASTE OF TIME,"Before watching the movie, check out the ""Extras"" where no one involved in the movie can even agree with what the movie is about. They can't even agree what ""genre"" the movie is.Basically the movie meanders on with EVERY character lying for the whole length of the movie - is Sam dead, alive, good, bad? Who done it or DIDN'T do it? Why?The REAL question should be why was this junk even made? Why did Travolta & Jackson even bother. The movie provides Travolta with his worst role since Vinny Barbarino and Jackson his worst role since appearing regularly on the Pee Wee Herman Playhouse with Geri curls. Don't these guys believe that they have more talent than this?Quote: People mistake me for Laurence Fishburne all the time. SORRY SAMUELJohn Row"
2,Samuel L. Jackson's performance makes this an alright movie but there are two many plot twists for the average viewer,"Basic is another failure of a film from director John McTiernan. McTiernan who used to make good movies like Preadtor, Die Hard & Die Hard 3 hasn't made a good movie since Die Hard 3 spins this confusing film. On one hand I do give the director respect for his attempt to make an uodated version of Rashmon but he film lacks the action sequences McTiernan is known for. The performances by Connie Nelson is horrible and she has a bad accent as for John Travolta he seems bored but as always Samuel L.Jackson delviers the good. The trailer spoils a lot for the film but trust me you try to figure out something in the film your head will hurt."
3,a basic review for Basic,"Basic had all the ingedients to be a good thriller. It had a well known director with a well deserved cast and a story with multiple plot twists that involved deception, murder, corruption, and a hint of romance. So what went wrong? What really went wrong with it was that the ending wasn't worth all the confusing plot twists that happened during the film. The ending wasn't worth all the figuring out I tried to do. And I really wasn't all that shocked or surprised with the ending. With films like these, you kinda have to expect a ending like the ending of Basic. I was never really interested enough in the film to really care about how it ended. The performances were great, the chemistry between Travolta and Nielsen was definitely there, and McTiernan did a fine job on the direction, but I really think this film failed at producing an interesting enough story to really care about the plot twists and its ending."
1,Why is there a female with a squad of Army Rangers,"All I want to know is, who was the genius that cast for this film??? Who decided they wanted to completely ruin any form of authenticity and put a generic stereotype macho female gung ho latino soldier (which does not exist on this planet) (Rosylyn Sanchez)in the movie, as a member of the Army's elite Rangers....give me a break. And then of course the weird, quirky, gay intellectual (played by Giovani Ribisi) who would NEVER even attempt to complete Ranger School... And Samuel Jackson just plain sucks. If you want to make yourself a movie with generic written all over it. Get Samuel Jackson to star in it. Yeah. He plays the same annoying loud mouth jackass in EVERY movie. Decent plot for the film, but badly executed. The acting and casting is a disgrace to Army Rangers....period."
3,Okay!John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson,"Well, i have already lose my hopes of watching John Travolta in a big hit again but this movie is okay.The story is about John Travolta, who investigates the disappearance of a legendary Army drill sergeant (Samuel L. Jackson) and a squad of his cadets after a training exercise in Panama.You will think ''I have already seen that in another movie before''. It tries to twist and turns everytime, and it kind of works. the thriller is not that intense but its worthy anyway!"
1,Complete GARBAGE,"When did Darth Vader ever ride a motorcycle???!!!This is a complete disgrace.Please, how about keeping Star Wars figures on the shelves instead of this trash..."
2,Not what I expected,"Although I did not hate it, and found some good advice, this wasn't what I expected. I was very surprised that part of this book includes volunteering, part-time and flex-time. Going back to work full-time with children is competely different. I thought that is what this book was geared to, but it is not really. And yes, as one reviewer pointed out, there are some awfully silly and trite comments/jokes that seem to be geared towards women who haven't set foot out of their house in 10 years. Further, it was published in 2004, yet they keep referring to the ""Classified"" want ads. From much of the content, I was surprised this book was not much older."
3,Koontz loses some of his suspense.,"In Sole Survivor, Koontz falls short of the well-craftedsuspense and general excellence of his last outing,Intensity. While Sole Survivor incorporates most of thegreat styles of Koontz's works, it overall lacks someof the incredible creations of suspense that has madehis last few books outstanding reading material. Whileslightly flawed, Sole Survivor still makes for a decentread for the avid Koontz fan."
1,I hate science fiction?!?!?,"The initial set up and story was intriging. It went WAY off the deep end for me. I like something you can somehow remotely believe in. This explanation of all the bizarre happenings is a cop out. Too ""Twilight Zoneish"" for me. Very disappointed in the ending. This is my first Koontz book. After reading how others rated this book and in reference to some of his others I may give this author another try. The only reason I kept reading is because I had already read more than half when this storyline took a ""nosedive."" I'm glad I got this at the library. I'd be really upset if I paid for it!"
2,Sole Survivor: Dean Koontz,This book was not up to Dean Koontz's usual quality. Story line was just too far from reality to get into the story
4,"VERY GOOD BEGINNING, VERY BAD END","At the beginning, you thought it was going to be a good book. In fact the first 390 pages were very good. It had a very intriguing story line and I was hoping for a great finish to the story. But then, after reading the ending, I realised there was absolutely NO forshadowing whatsoever;the ending was totally inpredictable and insane.What about Dean Koontz. Well, I really enjoyed his writing style; it made if-you-think-about-it-it's-not-really-scary-things give a chill up your spine. Koontz must've had a death in the family when he wrote this."
4,"Suspenseful, edgy and scary",This is one of Koontz' best piece of fiction to date. The idea of the conspiracy theory involving the government and plane crashes is a very challenging subject for an author to depict in writing. The suspense starts from Chapter 1 and doesnt give up till the last page. A must read for any Koontz fans.
3,"Suitable for ""Touched by an Angel"" TV fans","Dean Koontz is one of the best storytellers of the past 25 years. And Sole Survivor makes you keep reading, page after page, till you're hooked and have to see how it ends. But you'll need to be immune to Koontz's -- dare I say it: amateur -- attempts to fuse science and religion. And it'll also help if you share Koontz's Christian fervor, else you'll probably pitch the book into the round file when you're done."
2,I hated the ending to this book,"There was so much unfinished business at the end... there really was NO ending. Most of the book was good but I was left totally unsatisfied. I put a post-it note in the front of the book that said ""Crappy book"" so I wouldn't make the mistake of reading it again. I just can't believe so many people liked it."
2,Disappointing and predictable,"Having read all on the favourable reviews this book has received (and read some of his previous works), it was with some confidence that I decided to purchase 'Sole Survivor'...big mistake ! As I ventured further into the book, chapter by chapter, I couldn't help feeling a growing sense of disappointment with the storyline and what was becoming an increasingly predictable ending. (Incidentally, why does Koontz appear to rush the concluding chapters in his novels ?). I don't think I will be revisiting this novel for a very long time."
2,TERRIBLE ENDING!!!,"This book had a great story line and an exciting first half. However,in the second half of the book, the author just ""Koontzed"" with a totally unbelievable and wimpy ending!"
2,"Signature Koontz, Unfortunately","It'd been a few years since I'd read a Koontz book, and I picked this one up for giggles. Quite a disappointment, and a reminder of why it had been a few years since I'd read one. The book had the signature Koontz characteristics: 2-dimensional characters, an intriguing premise, one or two exciting scenes, and an absolute failure of a follow-through. Koontz does a decent job of getting you interested in the story and the mystery of what's going on, then turns the ending into a combination of deus ex machina and actionless exposition. Someone needs to teach him about story structure and how to write an ending that's a sufficient pay-off for the beginning. Does he just get tired, toward the end of the book? I sure did. Sole Survivor, like many of Koontz's novels, had a lot of potential. It just failed to achieve it."
1,boring,This book was so boring that I could hardly finish it. Sorry Dean Koontz but you're not that good of a writer. Stephen King is the best.
4,HELP,I thought this book was a lot of fun. One of Koontz's basic chase/suspense tales with likable characters. Does ANYBODY have a copy of the film version on DVD or VHS? I'd love to see it.
1,CIV IV Disapointing,"Big fan of CIV games up through CIV III. This version focused on animation and a introduced a clutsier interface. Game action slowed down, complexity up, and its harder to tell what my empire is doing.I finally just stopped playing it, the fun just isn't there anymore. A strategic game does not need fancier 3-D animation."
3,Good Bad and Ugly,"The good news is that thre is enough in civ iv to keep you deeply engaged for a long time. THe bad news is that it is a 50/50 shot whether your hardware will run it and this will keep you deeply enraged for just as long. As for the game, a lot of effort has gone in to dumbing down civ so that all the player has to do is watch animated battlers. Sort of like battle chess, only the squares you have to move to have been highlighted for you. Religion is in and its nice to know that if you found a religion you potentially have a nice source of income, one of the few things in the game that correspond precisely to reality."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I love the CIV series, each CIV improved and provided another level of enjoyment. This CIV we also see a lot of improvements... even in places where I thought the game could not be improved. BUT.... this game software is very unstable and keeps crashing. If you don't have a high end computer with above the recommend hardware requirements DON'T BUY and stick with your CIV3"
1,Buggier than a bad case of lice.,"This game may or not be good. It crashes non stop and tech support is non existant.I build gaming computers on the side for extra $$$ trust me, my machine can handle any game I throw at it... except this one.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game untill they release some patches to fix the serious issues this game has."
1,I'm so frustrated,"Like most of you I play Civ since 1992 and I was very excited to start today with Civ IV.Sadly, most of the bad comments I have read before are right.I have a ATI graphic cards and it is simply impossile to see the main map, instead I just have a black screen with cities and units... I will not expand on the long list of bugs I have already faced, you read that before :(I bought the game today and I KNOW there is nothing I can do about it, I will bring it back to the shop tomorow and wait for an updated version. So disapointed."
1,Check Your Hardware.,"Don't be fooled. Civilization used to be a great, low-needs game that could run on every system.Bugs are galore, landscapes and leaders won't render, and wonder movies will crash the game.Make sure you have a souped-up desktop and CHECK THE RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS. Horrible job educating people about this.Other than that, the gameplay is immersive, soundtrack is sweet, and love the new features. If only the developers and distributors were a little more conscientious in educating the consumer about the system requirements..."
1,this sux,"big civ fan, but not so much with this version. i dont have any problems running the game. graphics are nice. i enjoyed the new combat animations, except for armored vehicles, which looked cartoonish. unit promotions were a nice touch. there is way too much going on to keep up with and the game does not keep you informed of whats happening very well. theres a small text box that reads off world events, that you'll ignore or miss 90% of whats happening. as one person stated, micromanaging is a pain at best. the biggest gripe is that the game has an entirley different feel from all other installments, but that stems from inovations to the game. overall a few of the new features were nice, but this game is a step down from civ3, at least for me. i forced myself to complete one game. my suggestion is buy the game and have a go at it, you might like it, but there's always ebay."
1,The most poorly programmed game I have ever played,"I am a computer programmer, and this game makes me sick. I have never seen such a piece of trash thrown into a box and sold to people. I think the game itself is pretty interesting, but what does it matter since I can't play a game all the way through? Once I get to the 1800s or so, the game crashes every 2 or 3 turns. Firaxis and 2k Games (the companies responsible for this piece of garbage) should be ashamed of themselves. I want my $50 back until you finish beta testing!"
3,Old Memories Revisited,"I LOVED this satiric film when I first saw it ...in 1959, wasn't it? I had read and loved the Leonard Wibberley novels and was anticipating this vicarious tour of the Duchy of Grand Fenwick. In addition, like most American movie goers, I was fast becoming a Peter Sellers fan. The film was no disappointment. It had the added appeal of reinforcing my emerging pacifism. All that said... it has lost a bit of its allure for me when re-viewing it in 2010. Peter Sellers best work would follow this offering (e.g.: Lolita, Being There, etc.) and I have been a hopeless liberal for fifty more years. To be sure, this movie is a welcomed nostalgic trip back to the sensibilities that would become the 60's. Even if it doesn't quite generate the same energy I experienced at first-viewing, I am glad to have this old friend in my DVD Library. If you're an over-matured Hippie (like me) this just may be the movie for you."
4,Roaring back at the mouse,"This is a very silly movie, with a terribly contrived plot, however, watching Peter Sellers play 3 different roles was very entertaining! We watched it one night when my teens were uptight & just needed a good laugh. It was certainly that! Mindless drivel, and a fun time!"
1,Cannot easily use,What is Region 2 ?? Had to learn the hard way. Just means people in U.S. are not allowed to view them. Play it on PC! Will let you view 5 times.
3,OK But Not As Good As Its Sequel,"Though still very funny in spots the film loses it satiric bite halfway in. The superior seuqel ""The Mouse On The Moon"" (never on video) directed by Richard Lester did a much better job of spoofing cold war politics and was far zanier. Though usually great at muliple roles Peter Sellers' 3 performances here fall flat. The seuqel featured a much funnier Margaret Rutherford as the Queen and the hilarious Ron Moody a manic Prime Minister Bobo. Lets hope MGM/UA will finally release ""The Mouse On The Moon"" soon."
1,Not to scale.,Advertised as 1:87 scale. It is actually 1:138 and it is printed as 1:138 on display stand.
3,Pretty good product that looks nice,"I have gotten many comments on how nice my phone looks when I pull it out of my case. And I like the way that this cover fits over the phone. It does a good job protecting it which I enjoy since I don't like to keep spending money on new phones! However, the rubberized coating is peeling off on a couple of hard edges and my phone doesn't open and close flush unless I make it. It will open and close enough for the phone to function properly, it just isn't flush. Most people probably wouldn't notice, unless they're OCD like me."
2,What have they done to what could have been awsome,This Could have been a truly awsome concert on Dvd But what a dissapointment What did you do Kevin and Michael Kevin is definetly out with his words which you can clearly see with a few songs its almost like they have dubbed the sound track in the studio i cant fault the concert it is indeed awsome stage lighting everything But what did you do with the sound guys thats what id like to no the more i watch this dvd the more i feel ripped off If you do another concert dvd Please do a live show and keep it live sound and everything
4,"He puts the ""meat"" in Steinman","I bought this collection by default -- and am I glad I did! I consider Steinman to be one the most important rock songsmiths of the 70's-80's. And Meat Loaf sings Steinman like no one else. It's as if the two were destined to collaborate. The three ""new"" Steinman cuts on The Very Best of Meat Loaf are worth the price of the CD alone. Meat's voice has matured over the years; and he's ""grown up."" It shows. Once you've heard his cover of ""No Matter What"" you'll never go back to Boyzone. If you're a Meat Loaf junkie or a Steinman fan, this collection is a Must!"
5,What an entertaining CD!!!,"This CD has provided me with the biggest laughs in a long time.My personal favourites include The Queen of the Night, as well as a duet between Foster-Jenkins & a Flute, where at one point, they spend a few bars performing in unison - however, Foster-Jenkins completes the entire passage one semi-tone below the flute...truly a wonderful moment.One cannot forget the fantastic performance by the gentleman in his rendition of ""Avant de Quitter Ces Lieux""...or, in his words, ""Ere I leave my native land"".. Another wonderful moment.This CD is a wonderful display of how terribly entertaining horrific singing can be at times.A wonderful laugh....you won't be disappointed!"
5,Inspirational,"Florence Foster Jenkins couldn't sing worth a damn. But she spent considerable resources and time -not to mention any sense of shame she might have possessed- to become a recorded classical soprano. She's flat out awful. But she did it because it was her dream.You cannot fail to admire this attitude; it's what life is all about. If this woman can go out and sing this badly in front of so many people and not look back, what possible excuse can the rest of us have for nursing unacted desires?"
3,So BAD she's GOOD,"This is the most remarkable singing in all of recorded history. So BAD she's GOOD, Florence Foster Jenkins bankrolled herself into mini-stardom selling out her invitation-only once-a-year recitals until she became so legendary, she sold out Carnegie Hall to an audience snickering into their handkerchiefs. These recordings showcase that as BAD as Jenkins is, she gets WORSE . . . brilliantly so! With sensitive and serious accompaniment, Jenkins' voice is like a cross between a clucking chicken and a squeak toy played by Rusty Hinge. Each tune reveals a new vocal weakness (at best) or a deeper absurdity (at very best); these selections are a Punk miracle of self-delusion. I am grateful to all the brave reviewers who gave 5 stars 'cause they're right in its essential laughter factor; if you have a funny bone you cannot NOT laugh while listening to this lady sing!"
3,GREAT,Alhtough I wasn't thrilled about the reading book it did come very quickly although it was clearly aged it was still in good condition.
5,Everyday fancy,"I bought this as a gift for my stepbrother, who has always walked to his own bongo drum. The colors were vibrant and, six months later through the treatment of a teenage boy, they are still holding up and not doing the plastic flaky thing that many pictures do. He loves it and gets the oddest looks with a mohawk and a tuxedo shirt."
5,Excellent guide book,This is my fourth Rough Guide book and as usual it's lived up to my expectations. The descriptions are brutally honest and there's tons of great - and accurate - recommendations both on and off the beaten path. Gave us a great overview on what to expect for our trip to Tokyo and allowed us to put together an itinerary on our own. Even more importantly it was fun and easy to read! It's really like having a local with you.
4,More variety of Tetris!,I am a fan of Tetris on my old Nintendo System and always loved puzzles. Fast forward 20 years and there is Tetris for the DS! I was skeptical because I thought it was an exact replica of the old classic Tetris game. I read it had variety of games in there so I decided to get it.It does bring back memories! There are six different Tetris games! One of my favorites is the one where they tell you which piece to use to make a line or two. And it gets harder as you go. Another game has you move Tetris pieces piled up high on each other and you use your stylus to move the pieces around to make lines. And few more games.It is a good buy if you are a Tetris/puzzle fan!
3,a little retro,"i kinda thought this game would be more up-to-date with the DS stuff, like using the stylus more, so i really think its a lot more retro than DS-like.its ok i still play it."
2,"Good on first listen, but gets old quickly","Americana is an upbeat, catchy pop/rock/punk album that is pretty good at first listen with songs like the uplifting Feelings,skaa-reggae-ish Why Don't You Get a Job?, and one of the only true punk tracks, The Kids Aren't Alright. The Offspring who were once a punk band have turned more into a mainstream band just making a bunch of songs that they know will get play on the radio (uh, can somebody say Pretty Fly For a White Guy). Their sound is ultimitely more bubbley and a lot of depth to their music has been lost. Other songs that suck include Pay the Man, Americana, Pretty Fly For a White Guy, and Walla Walla. Another problem with the cd is that the songs that are good are only good for the first few times,but then slowly get old. I think the reason for that is the music is just too pop-flavored. This cd will disappoint Offspring fans."
1,It sucks,"This album sucks. Any die-hard Offspring fan will know that this album is a pile. The songs all sound the same, and they all sound like they belong right next to 'N Sync, with a little added guitar work.Pretty Fly For A White Guy sounds good at first, but then it starts getting old, then it gets annoying, and then you wonder why the hell everyone else thinks it's so great. Anyone who buys this album can enjoy about 9 minutes of listening to it (Pretty Fly 3 times?), and then gets fed up with it and throws it in the back of his collection."
3,Pretty Damn Good,Not to bad of a record for a band thats been around over 10 years. As far as the single the usual hooks that Offspring are capable of. To bad that it's got the same formula as Keep em' Separated. Anyways the first three songs are quite innovative w/ the chilling segways. Way to go. If you want to hear some new blood check out the Latch Key Kids from houston Texas They'll show Offspring how it's done going into 2000. Late
2,This CD sucks compared to their older ones,They have f**king sold out to the mainstream. Their older albums have more originality and quality sounds. Plus all the song on this disk sound the same.
2,Half and Half,"Offspring have gone real soft, they sold out, just for all u lamers THIS IS NOT PUNK! sure there are some cool classic punkish songs like ""have you ever"" and ""americana"", but ""pretty fly for a white guy"" is so horrifyingly ""popish and repetitive"" it makes me sad. I own all of the offspring cd's even some bootlesgs, and i can't believe what they have done to their sound. It isn't pure anymore. Still i recommend the CD, for having some good songs."
2,You Call This...PUNK?!!,"Not half as bad as Conspiracy of One, but still a major blow factor behind this one. When I first bought it, I was into the whole Blink 182 thing going on. But now, I listen to REAL PUNK MUSIC and I really...hate this failure. Suprisingly it's from a band who I usually like the music by. However, this goes into a sissy, crummy, boring...posuer record with the least thought out lyrics ever. What really kills it is the ultimatly cheesy, radio-friendly ""Pretty Fly (for a white guy)"" which is a shocker compared to their earlier accomplishments. It's probably the worst album I ever bought and actually liked at one point in my life...."
5,This CD rocks! One of the best cds i have ever heard.,"The first time i listened to this cd, i fell in love. This is not only because the previus 4 cds made them my favorite band. Every one of their cds have gotten better. This cd is so much more than just "" pretty fly for a white guy"" It is solid all the way through, and ive listened to it almost every day since i got it. That was FOUR months ago!! I warn you, if you buy this cd, you will fall in love with the offspring. I DID"
5,great cd!,This is an awesome CD. Offspring is my favorite group and Americana and Smash are my favorite CDs. This is an excellent CD with great lyrics. Buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,not as good as the past,"ive been a fan of the Offspring for a while, but Americana just isnt as good as past efforts. It isnt even close to the performance of SMASH and IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE, or even IGNITION, one of their earlier cd's. But i still have to hand it to them with songs such as Shes got issues, The kids arent allright and ...Get a job. I would have given it a 3 STAR RATING, but i saw them in concert and it was a hell of a show. If youre looking for the ""real"" Offspring get Smash or Ixnay on the hombre."
5,It's really cool.,It's a really cool CD. The way he sings is I don't know different but cool. My friend got me to listing to them. And when we listened to them coming home from Dallas we pumped up the player and listened to them all the way home. Their awesome dude!!!!!!
4,This is a great CD,"I have never heard their other CD's but judging from this one I'll be buying them soon, They have a great beat and a few awsome songs, including Pretty Fly, The kids are alright and The best... Why don't you get a job"
4,Very nice album,"I love this album; it was definately worth my money. My favorite song is ""The Kids Aren't Alright."" The songs on here are all great but they are WAY too short. That would mark it down a star because if you really like a song, you'll want to hear it longer. 3 minutes and something seconds is not long enough for all the songs on the album. Other than that, an awesome album"
1,Miserably disappointing.,"I'm convinced after listening to ""Americana"" 8 or 9 times; that The Offspring have offically reached previously uncharted artistic depths at this juncture in their careers. Essentially all ""Americana"" is, is a bunch of obviously shamless plagerisims of older songs (they used to be called ""covers,"" but not when they've rewritten the lyrics). Oh yeah, great lead single fellas in ""Pretty fly for a white guy'"" I guess that's testement to your Wildean wit. My overall impression of these guys judging from the video's and these gormless songs: are just a bunch of Alternative-Nation geeks that go through life bending over for a cheap laugh and never once making an erudite or poignant musing. For all of you who loath The Offsprings latest opus as much as I do; go out and purchase ""The Record"" by Fear, it puts this unremarkable piece of commercial dreck to shame."
2,The Offspring are giving Punk Music a bad name!,"The offspring have gone down the toilet. They are doing whatever it takes to be popular even though they used to be really anti-trendy. IF YOU WANT A BUNCH OF WANNABE'S THAT CAN'T DECIDE ON ONE GENRE THEN GO WITH THE OFFSPRING.IF YOU WANT GOOD PUNK MUSIC GO WITH GREEN DAY!!!!go to the little box up there,type in Green Day and hit Return, you're done here."
4,"Pretty good, but Smash is way better","I mainly bought this for the 4 hit songs ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"", ""Why don't You Get A Job?"", ""The Kids Aren't Alright"", & ""Shes Got Issues"", which are all great songs, and a few other good ones include Americana, Staring at the Sun, and Pay the Man. It also does something cool when u put it in the computer. But seriously, if u just got into the Offspring and are looking for this album, get one of their older albums first, like Smash, Ignition, & Ixnay on the Hombre, or their hard-to-find self-titled debut. Still this is good, but if I had to choose between this and Smash, Smash would definitely be it."
3,Warning: Massive Trendies Alert!!,"All those MTV fans who found out about Offspring from ""Pretty Fly (For a white guy)"", are trendies who like them now, but in a year or 2 may completely forget they even exist, (remember Hanson, Kriss Kross, M C Hammer). Whats more interesting is that, the Offspring themselves didn't change their style from their previous albums.Pushing all those trendies aside, this album is ok, but nowhere close to Smash or Ixnay. I especially like ""Pay The Man"". Old Offspring fans might not like this."
5,"Good music, loud music, hey it's offspring!","I think that Americana is really good~ The Offspring make such good punky alternative rock, they totally rule. Americana has the best songs, and they all kick so much ass! Hey man, the louder the better!"
4,not their greatest cd,"This cd has some great tracks on it, but it also has some crappy ones like ""pretty fly (for a white guy)"", ""she's got issues"", and ""why don't you get a job"" I don't really like any of those tracks, but the rest of the tracks are pretty sweet, I still recommend buying it, but those tracks are the reason for the 4 instead of 5."
4,fairy good offspring cd,"not as good as smash or ixnay on the hombre, this cd is pretty good. songs like no brakes, have you ever, staring at the sun, the end of the line, and americana are good songs. the offspring didn't sellout. there new cd will sound like there old stuff."
2,The Offspring are awesome - but not Americana,"Don't waste your money on the ENHANCED version of this CD. The normal CD already is enhanced, with a Sony music extra (videos + stuff). Besides, Americana is not worth the money. Their sellout CD's (Americana, Ixnay on the Hombray) suck. So go for it, be a man, and buy the real Offspring, the hardcore punk, the best albums - Smash, Ignition, and The Offspring"
1,SOMEBODY GET THE HOOK,Offspring's AMERICANA displays yet again the MTV experience of featuring a youthful punk-influenced garage band with little or no talent. Offspring still lacks the musicianship and lyrical sophistication to ever get beyond the mindless drivel from their current CDs. Aren't the 90s just great for music?
2,not for music fans,if you are under 15 (or if you have the music iq of a 15 yearold) then this album is for you. this band just spews out songs for the point of spewing out songs. pointless pop music that gets boring and annoying quickly.if you are looking for decent music look elsewhere.
1,it kinda sucked a lot,"""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" is the song to blame for the death of punk music. Dexter Holland's voice is incredibly annoying. I kinda liked ""She's Got Issues"" and ""The Kids Aren't Alright"", but the rest of the CD is very bad. I used to like the Offspring, but now they completely sold out with ""Pretty Fly"". If you want REAL punk music, check out Bad Religion or Refused."
4,"Entertaining, yet lacking.","!Heather's Teenage Son!Being a die-hard Offspring fan, I of course enjoyed this album alot. But, it's definately not them at their best. Their best albums are definately Ixnay and Conspiracy of One, while this is their worst...but I'm giving it 4 stars. So, that should tell you how purely awesome this band is. The track ""Walla Walla"" is fast and fun and I love listening to it over and over again, so I would suggest you listen to that one. ""She's Got Issues"" is great and catchy, and my favorite track on this CD. ""Pretty Fly"" is entertaining, also along with their other single off this album ""Why Don't You Get A Job"". But, there is one song on here called ""Have You Ever"". It sounds so much like ""Dirty Magic"" from the album Ignition it's not even funny. So, skip that one unless you want to hear ""Dirty Magic"" only faster.So, overall this album entertains but their lyrics are not as meaningful as on their other CDs. Get this one if, like me, you absolutely love this band."
2,Why Don't They Get A Job?,"The offspring needs to just QUIT. over the years, they have just gotten worse and worse, i think its time for them to just give up...this album gets incredibly annoying after you hear it about 2.5 times...and it becomes bubble gum music...music that you listen to which forces you to want to jam wads of bubble gum into your ears so you don't have to listen to it....and YES its THAT bad"
5,This cd is awesome,I love this cd because it has so many great songs on it!!!If i could rate this cd in one word that word would be EXCELLENT
2,do not buy,the offspring joined the mainstream and then changed like most bands do after they join the mainstream that change started with ixnay on the hombre and finished with this album ixnay was good this is not
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","Hate to tell all you MTV watching ""Punks"". But offspring stopped playing real punk a long, long time ago. If you like this music thats fine, I don't. But please for the sake of mankind don't go around thinking you are listing to punk rock. Your not. I would suggest in fact, not to even buy this or any other offspring cd. But if you truly must buy an offspring cd, buy one from when they released cds through epitah records. Before their sell out days."
4,Great album! Some excellent songs on here!!,"Some great classic songs of Offspring's including the very well known Pretty Fly (for A White Guy) & The Kids Aren't Alright, not to mention other great hidden gem songs like Staring At The Sun, She's Got Issues, & Why Don't You Get A Job? Thanks"
2,TWO GOOD SONGS AND NOTHING ELSE,"There are only 2 good songs on this CD, they are Pretty Fly and Why Don't You Get a Job? Why should anyone pay 20 bucks for only 2 songs. My advice is to go to a mp3 download page and download those 2 songs and you will have what americana is all about."
3,It's Okay... Slightly Annoying...,"This CD was okay, but definitley NOT Offspring's best. Pretty FLy is a cool song, but If you listen to it too much it gets old FAST. The only good songs on this CD are pretty fly, the kid's aren't alright, why don't you get a job, and americana. the song americana talks about important things like how the world is coming to now adays, same with the kid's aren't alright. This CD is more of a fun kinda thing, and isn't a work of art."
5,Their best so far,"This CD captivated me, especially the songs ""Americana"" and ""Pay the Man."" The lyrics are original, fully mirroring the Offspring's opinions on issues we deal with today."
3,'Americana' alright but not nearly as good as 'Smash',"This Offspring's fifth CD has several good punk rock songs such as ""The Kids Aren't Alright"" ""Staring At the Sun"" and ""Have You Ever,"" and the creative ""Pretty Fly For A White Guy"" it at first has potential of being good. But then it's just too bad that none of the other songs on the album are worth it, suffering from the lack of creativity displayed in ""She's Got Issues"" and ""Why Don't You Get A Job."""
3,Not as good as their previous work.,"I love the Offspring. They're one of my favorite bands, but I have to say that Americana just isn't them. If it wasn't for The Kids Aren't Alright I would say that they sold out. They've changed their music and now have a completely differant following, which is their decision but I don't respect it. They WERE one of the greatest punk bands around and I'm afraid that they've lost their touch. But like I said, The Kids Aren't Alright is amazing and purly Offspring. Kudos."
5,Gay Athetes Games Sydney Australia,"When purchasing DVDs you should be very aware that there is both a private and personnal factor for these documentary types.There is a very important historical factor due the event itself, even many years after the event has taken place. I was in the Opening Ceremony of this such event and wanted to make sure my own personnal collection was equipped with a copy for years to come.A GREAT time to be around in a great city."
2,not the instant snow I was expecting!,"Quick shipping on product but the product was not what I was hoping for. The ""snow"" was much grainer than I had expected. I had seen what I thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that ""instant snow"" was very fine and really looked like snow. This product doesn't look much like snow and doesn't have the same texture."
4,could be better,these ice trays are handy to have if you want to keep a bottle of water or whatever cold and you dont want to bring a cooler. the problem i have with them is that the cubes are so thin in diameter that you practically have to put a whole trays worth in a bottle to keep it cold for any length of time. also in a frost free freezer they hardly last very long because of the frost free feature. so if the cubes were a little bigger in diameter and if the trays had a cover i might have given it 5 stars.
2,"Great idea, poor execution","The ice trays are shallow. Seriously shallow. And the entire thing is floppy. It's basically impossible to move by itself - you have to put it on something stiff and slide it in. It's also not stackable. Once you do get it frozen, though, the results are pretty good."
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this item and sent it back the next day. The floppy silicone is not a good choice for an ice cube tray, and the slots to fill are so shallow (approx. 1/4 inch deep) that filling them is a messy experience. I wanted to fill them with sweet tea, as that is my favorite drink and I don't like it watered down. I think I got more tea on the counter than I did in the tray. This is not a good product."
5,A Favorite Disc...,"This is a wonderful disc featuring Strauss waltzes as transcribed for small ensemble by members of the Second Viennese School. The occasion was for a benefit concert in the Spring of 1921 for the Society for the Private Performance of Music in Vienna. The goal of the Society was to properly present Modern music to an appreciative audience of members.These are tasty realizations of echt-Viennese music. Nice cover art by Van Gogh, as well. As an added bonus, this disc features Schoenberg's Weihnachtsmusik (Musique de Nol--i.e., Christmas Music) a beautiful piece in the pure tonal key of C major.It should be remembered that the waltz was a revolutionary occurrence in cultural/social history: it permitted close embrace of partners in a whirling, sexually charged atmosphere. Previous bourgeoise dancing had consisted of quadrilles and such as involved little touching between dancers who were not really partners as they danced with others together."
5,Great music,"Usually with music I have something to complain about, the sound quality, the performance, the composition, ect.. I'm a picky listener. I can't find anything wrong with this. The performance is really good, nothing about it annoys me, played at just the right pace and mistakes are at a minimum. The sound quality is excellent, what you should expect from a modern recording. It was recorded in 1996. The music itself is very lively, there's never a boring moment, yet it's still beautiful at times."
4,A 'must-buy',"One can easily imagine a more engaging text than the Rees' now-standard reference (and one that doesn't include the imaginatve expansion of Dumezil), but this volume is worth its full price for the index alone."
4,At Tines I Was Not Sure His Reign Of Crime Laster As Long As This Movie,"This movie is good, but it is not great. Why you ask. Well, it is because this movie just drags at points. I think it had the potential to be a grab-you-by-the-lapels type of gangster movie, but it never pulls it off. It fails to do that because it gets caught up in a great deal of back story that focuses attention away from any chases or action. And all the story is not as interesting as someone thought, so the movie becomes very, very slow. Oh well, but it is still worth renting or buying real, real cheap."
4,Very entertaining,"It's pretty violent (but then, so were the 1930's.) Johnny Depp and Christian Bale square off as the gangster (John Dillinger) and the G-man (Melvin Purvis). Both are outstanding, and you get a little history lesson while being thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend this movie."
2,STOP with the damned handheld camera!,"""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" are two of my favorite films, so you can imagine how psyched I was to see ""Public Enemies."" Suffice it to say that I was hugely disappointed. First and foremost, I HATED the cinematography. I would have happily paid for Dante Spinoti's tripod, out of my own pocket, if only anyone would have asked. STOP with the damned handheld camera! It didn't convey ""you are there,"" it conveyed ""you are nauseous."" Also, Johnny Depp and Christian Bale might as well have been mannequins. They're wonderful actors, who were given no opportunity here to act (i.e., to show any significant character development). Michael Mann is a great director, but in my book, this is a misfire."
3,strange camera work...,"I don't know when it happened, but at some point I found myself yanked out of the experience by the camera work. Johnny Depp had a charismatic performance, but somewhere during the shootout in the woods, it started to feel more like a reality tv show with a hand-held video camera. I don't know if the camera was too accurate or just different. The the lights were glaring, sometimes the cars looked a little too shiny and colors seemed a little strange."
3,Shooting blanks,"Some great segments that never come together to be a great movie. Ultimately an incomplete, unsatisfactory cinema experience with muted acting and action that never quite delivers. I'm a great fan of Depp but he's not at his best here, neither are other actors (if you want to see Marion Cotillard at her best, see La Vien Rose instead). As for Christian Bale, it's getting tiresome to see him repeat his square jawed, dead serious characterization again. No need to really discuss the plot since most of us know the story of Dillinger, so it all comes down to how Mann draws us into the journey. Too bad he ends up shooting blanks. Wanna see Mann near his directorial top? See Collateral instead."
1,2.5 Hour Bore-Fest,"Positively the worst Mann movie I've seen. Depp is completely wasted in this slow, ponderous, bland, characterless drone of a movie. Bale is non-existant. Cardboard cutouts have more character than those portrayed in this movie. We know nothing about them at the start - and even less once it's over. You'll be very happy when it's over."
3,"Good Movie, Needs to check facts","Great movie - no problem there. However, besides the three or four main people, the acting was terrible.Yes, movies can take some liberties on the truth, however SO MANY facts were just not correct (i.e. The movie has Baby Face Nelson dying AT Little Bohemia). The ORIGINAL story is so compelling, why even need to ""add in"" and ""take away"" from the truth?"
4,Much style and some substance,"It's always interesting to follow Michael Mann's movies. He's a great stylist and provokes a lot of thought. The style here puts us in the period of ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde."" But the depth of the moral and spiritual conflicts in ""Perdition"" and the challenge to authority in ""B&C;"" put them both in a higher league than this picture. Mann is exploring the moral allegiances of his main characters and links them to their social class background. Dillinger, as played by Johnny Depp, is brashly ambitious, climbing up out of a low class, abusive family and taking a fast break for the high life. Christian Bale's Melvin Purvis is an idealistic Southern aristocrat, tortured by the measures J.Edgar Hoover (the always remarkable Billy Crudup) forces him to take to fight the crime wave sweeping the nation.Really well acted, beautifully shot and crisply written. Not a great movie, but a really good one. Lots of corpses and a scene of torture."
4,Great movie set and filmed in Chicago,"As a Chicagoan I have seen movies at the Biograph Theatre, and know quite a bit about Chicago history. The main reason I was interested in this movie was because a friend of my daughter-in-law actually was hired as an extra during the filming. I spotted her in the movie, and I love it when the film actually uses local landmarks for a movie as this one did. I'm not exactly sure how true to life the story is, but it certainly was believable. The acting was very good. The only thing I would caution viewers about is that there is quite a bit of bloody violence which may turn some people off. Just close your eyes. The rest of the movie is excellent. I saw the movie originally in a theatre, but wanted to DVD to see it again. Plus the DVD has extra features which you don't get in the theatre."
3,Weak.,"Watched the first hour and cut it off. I had high hopes as I like the actors but man, I couldn't bare this movie any longer! What happened?!!!!"
2,I liked it in the theater . .,". . but it is shocking to me that a film made in 2009 and transferred to Blu Ray in the same year can look this bad. One of the worst transfers I've seen. I hate to judge a film based on the transfer, but it is tragically and distractingly bad. It's very dark and you get a lot of white flashing, noise, and a lot of grain. I've seen some pretty bad transfers on older films, but movies like The Good, Bad, and the Ugly which are three decades old looked better than this. No where near the picture quality of more recent releases like Dark Knight, Seabbiscuit, or Star Trek."
5,good as the book,"this movie,in my opinion is the best gangset flic to date. shoot-outs are great.shows J_Edgar for the coward he was."
1,that was bad,"movie was boring...characters are poor. Depp is a good actor, but Mann couldn't use him well enough....""Heat"" is Mann's best movie, no doubts"
3,A Historical Artifact....,"All you need to know about this book is that it was written in 1934. In other words... time has passed it by. Not to say that its entirely useless -- it was a great book for its era -- but if you read it now, you have to slog through a lot of outdated material to get at the good stuff (think of it as panning for gold).If you really want to read it, go ahead, it won't hurt you, but be mindful that there are more modern books out there."
4,Good for detailed Statement Analysis,This book is definitely not for beginners. It would be best used by someone who is going to do a very detailed analysis of company statements. It would be particularly helpful for someone trying to learn about the typical ways of window-dressing financial statements.
5,A MUST read,"Security Analysis is the most important book ever written about the subject. It should be mandatory to read this book prior to getting any security license.Sven Klein, Santa Barbara, CA"
3,not this one ! ! !,"i don't believe this deserves a 5 star rating . this is a 180 turn around from the other cd's . the god thing deserves a 5 star rating as does christ o , far off grace , beyond daylight and the "" live "" spirit of live ... i'm not goin thru this crap about soaring melodies & cool riffs and all the junk , just buy "" the god thing "" first then test the rest . you'll find out that the accult will be on the bottom of your list for this dynamite band . they do know how to rock ! ! !you will not be dissappointed . . . ."
5,Love it!,The Adobe Creative Suite is a great product which is easy to learn and use. Creativity is limitless once you learn the tools and become adept at it. Also the shortcuts are invaluable.
2,Not what it seems,"This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans. I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that. The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat. The ""meal"" is flaky. The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places."
5,Mayynnnnnnnne!,"Maynt THis cd is off tha chain. He clowned on mike jones tha whole way. Thoed cd 4sho. Other than this cd another new thoed undaground cd from hOuston would be them 4sho Ent Boyz ""Tha Texas Microphone Massacare"" they thoed 2. if u aint heard of em...heres there website 2. www.4shoentertainment.4t.com"
5,Aka tha king koopa,cahmillionaire spits much better than most southern rappers and is much better than dyke jones
5,this is hott,this cd is so tight man cham is a genius and[...]. this is a really hard hitting cd i think i underpaid this cd becuase it's so good 3 disk and there is this tight song with kanye west on it check this cd out and you will see what i mean
3,Average Cd,"This was a good cd for about the first 4 tracks because he used a lot of beats from ""The Documentary"" and the chopped and screwed cd was very well done. Trae can rap, but he needs better beats on the cd before he breaks out."
3,Super Reader,"The Tleilaxu are working on a artificial version of melange, the longevity drug, and fuel for the Guild navigators.A great house is destroyed through these machinations to allow those in power to seize more control of the distribution.The Harkonnen schemes are seen, as is the Bene Gesserit manipulations behind the scenes, one of the results being the Lady Jessica. Along the way, Leto Atreides generally tries to do the right thing for his own people, and his friends in the fallen house."
4,Rick's Last tight 80's Album,"this was my last tight Rick album from the 80's.the title track""cold Blooded"" was wicked funky.Rick to me was also the Last King of Funk.He brought it raw&did His thing.""Pimp The Simp"" was street&had all the classic stone city band trimmings.Grandmaster Flash nailed the Rap down too cold.""Ebony Eyes"" with Smokey Robinson was a Great song dedicated to African Queens Everywhere.the Beats&grooves were on point.""U Bring the Freak Out"" was Rick on a funk New wave tip that works."
5,Too bad we had to leave it behind!,"My son received this as a 5th birthday present, and played with it for three days straight before we had to move out of our parsonage due to an extensive remodel. In our small apartment, we didn't have room for his Thomas table, so we left this behind. He will be glad to get back to it in a couple of weeks!He loves the trees and windmill, especially, as well as the ""thunder and lightning"". I love that there are no batteries! If your child has seen Calling All Engines, s/he will LOVE this set! Another plus is that, with this being an actual ""set"", DS can build it himself~whereas with the individual pieces (of which we have quite a collection), he relies more on us to ""build him a new track"", and get it all to fit on his train table.As always, good quality products. But also, as always~Thomas is an expensive habit! :-)"
2,Dry,I love the color and have used it before but this product seems very dry on my lips so I have to mix it with lip moisturizer
5,Christmas gift,This is a Christmas gift so the recipient hasn't received it. I expect her to be very happy with these tea spoons.
5,GREAT INSPIRATIONAL MIX,"My dad got this for me for christmas after it first came out and I was amazed at the songs. Among my favorites are WALK WIITH YOU, LOVE CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS, YOU WERE LOVED, COLOUR EVERYWHERE, and INDEPENDENCE DAY. I listen to this album all the time. TESTIFY TO LOVE is good to. Get this cd."
5,Touched by a Soundtrack!,"What an amazing album this is! If you're a fan of the hit TV show, then you're bound to love this inspirational soundtrack. Filled with great talent such as Della Reese, Celene Dion, Wynonna, & Faith Hill, how can you go wrong? The songs by Celine Dion (""Love Can Move Mountains"") and Wynonna (""Testify to Love"") are worth the price of the CD itself. You can't miss this one!"
4,Inspiring. Music that will lift you up.,"As a fan of the show, I'm always moved to tears by the words of wisdom delivered by the angels in every episode. Just like the show, the soundtrack will inspire you. It will touch your heart and make you smile. It will give you a desire to do good. This CD truly testifies of God's love."
5,I'm looking forward to the next one!,"I listen to ""Touched by an Angel"" everyday since I got it last Christmas! It has a way of bring me up when I don't feel so up! I've enjoyed every piece on it! Has anyone heard if there will be a new release?"
3,Good,"It's Not the music I was hoping for from the show. It is good Music for Country/Jass lovers. Unfortunately, It's not MY cup of tea. The last song on the cd made it worth buying.There were no problems with delivery, that was prompt."
4,I enjoyed it!!!,I enjoyed it!!! Would have like it more if we knew what happen to the past cast from season 1 but over all a good show! Looking forward to season 3.
1,so-so,"I don't know if it is because the songs are old, or for another reason, but the sound of these two CD's is not as good as the sound of my other CD's."
2,GEORGE IS TIRED...LETS GO ON TO SOMETHING ELSE.,"George Michael's latest effort shows he is past his prime. His latest effort Outside just sounds like another one of his hits...Too Funky? Fast Love?...I am so confused...He left out some of his best songs, Hand To Mouth, Soul Free, and Older, and puts on B Sides like Desfinado and Somebody to Love....boring! George you better come out with something new and fresh soon, or its curtains honey!"
4,"It's great to have GM back on the music racks, BUT....","I'm disappointed that the US version and the import version of this set differ. I have to be honest here, the CD for me was worth every penny because I've been a fan for as long as I can remember and I don't have Michael's early music on CD. The new release of old hits has been a long time in coming, but this US version is missing two key songs. Waltz Away Dreaming, which Michael wrote for his mom, and As, a duet with Mary J. Blige. Sorry folks, but if you want these, you'll have to buy the casette (which makes me wonder why they'd include new tracks on a tape when it's the 90's and CD's are now much more common), and/or the import version. If it weren't for this shortcoming, this CD would be worth the full 5 stars."
5,I LIVE FOR THIS CD,Let's put it this way. I could very easily and happily survive many months on a deserted island with these 2 CDs.
1,Service,I never received this item...the system would not let my update my new address AFTER I ordered it...so it went to my old address...I never got the CD and I as of yet I have not been refunded the purchase price.
2,OK CD,Sorry after the first 4 songs the album is a waste of money. All the rest are just boring copies of each other.
1,If this is the best????,"I would hate to hear his music that is considered mediocre. Please, I can't believe that any of you like this trash.One more thing: Tell George to stop smoking pot."
5,GEORGE MICHAEL--TRUELY AN ONE OF A KIND,"George Michael holds a style and talent that is absolutely unique and impressive. He has reinvented himself through the years, and besides the bad publicity, he is still stands alone in the pop genre. A 2-CD set commenerating his best works is a far understatement. It should have included other hits like ""Everything She Wants"", ""It Doesn't Really Matter"", ""I'm Your Man"", ""Move On"", and the very hard to find ""Last Christmas"". Nevertheless, this CD set still houses a great selection of George Michael. This is a must buy for anyone who loves music."
5,An Underappreciated Talent,"George Michael quite simply has one of the best voices I have ever heard. It's incredible to hear someone sing with so much emotion. This CD, with about 140 minutes of music, is a steal!"
2,Not much to the game!,"It took me a while to understand what is involved in this game. The idea behind the game is so simple that at first I didn't believe I had it right. You have to match the pattern on some gifts to a pattern on the clothing of the witches. The trick seems to be that one of the five witches is almost impossible to find. This means that you look at the same screens over and over and click on the same pictures again and again. The witches come out and say things that no child could understand; it has a very dry, very adult sense of humor. And very, very boring!!!! Also, the game pops back and forth from Dutch to English at its whim. Very annoying when one of those long speeches comes on and you have to listen to the whole thing in a foreign language. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
5,Salux beauty skin cloth supersedes any other bath cloth!,"Long enough to wash your back, will wad up something like a pouf, but the texture is perfect! You will wonder why you've ever used a cloth to wash your body (not ideal for the face with sensitive skin). Makes super lather from your bar or liquid soap. Rinses clean after every use. It will spoil you! Lasts for years with daily use."
1,"Celine Dion, please retire, your albums are just sh*t.","Why do we have to go through this, why does Celine Dion releases 200 albums a year. Can't she quit?"
2,Celine is the best but this CD was not,I expected much more from this production; what a let down; too many duets and other busy-ness going on here
4,My wife loves it!,"My wife has always been a Celine Dion fan, and she therefore asked that we get this CD for the holiday season. Personally I'm not a fan, which is why I only give four stars. The delivery was fast and timely."
4,These Are Special Times,"We bought this CD for my 8 year old daughter who loves Celine Dion's version of Brahm's Lullaby. She didn't care much for anything else on there, but we do like some of the songs on this holiday CD."
5,great christmas CD,This product got used quite often. We listen to it every night at work. Our residents enjoy the songs.Also so do the workers.
4,Deeply moving Christmas CD!!,"Overall, I think this is a very high caliber CD. Celine's rendition of Ave Maria blows me away! I have played it *many* times in the last few days!! There are a couple of songs that are a little irritating to my ears, but suffice it to say that Celine does her most outstanding singing when she ""takes it easy"" and doesn't force/push her voice too much...Examples of flying low and sounding like an angel: Ave Maria(with passion, but not over-the-top), Brahm's Lullaby, Blue Christmas....Definitely a CD I will play through the holidays and beyond!!"
4,The Prayer,"After listening to this CD and hearing The Prayer with Andrea Bocelli, I had to hear more of his music. I purchased Romanza...incredibly beautiful. Didn't understand a word because it's all in Italian, but it didn't matter. Do yourself a favor and listen to more of Bocelli's music, especially the CD Romanza. You won't be disappointed."
5,One of Dion's best works up to date...,"Simply amazing! The diva has done it again. Sometimes hushed and tender, at others sung with unrestrained passion... with Dion's impressive voice delivering melodies both familiar and delightfully new to the ear the album is sure to provide a rare treatment to the listener. Forget about this being a 'Christmas album' - the CD is going to stay in my portable player for all year long."
4,A great expedition from the warmth of your own reading chair,"Arctic Son keeps the reader ""involved"" and teaches you about surviving the Arctic North. I learned it is not something I would like to do, with months upon months of frozen everything and darkness. This book helps you to appreciate what you have and the warmth of your own home! It is nice for this authro to write about her adventures in the Arctic and share this true life tale with us, the readers.I recommend reading this if you are interested in exploring the world around you, especially the wild and frigid Arctic North."
3,"Good story, fair writing, new-age philosophy, poor editing","I love reading about Alaska, and I wanted to love this book, but while the story was fascinating, the writing was tepid and the philosophy was a bit adolescent.There is a passage in which she describes the arctic light and the way it reminded her of classical music: to most of us, this might mean Bartok, Poulenc or Debussy; she thought of George Winston.It wasn't a travesty, merely a disappointment."
1,How Boring!!!!!,I think that this book was very boring because all it talks about is Anastasia going to modeling school and interviewing a bookstore owner in Downtown Boston for a school project. Characters in this book are Anastasia Krupnik and Henry Peabody. They both went to modeling school and became best friends. I do not recommend this book to anyone unless you want to be seriously bored.
1,"Boring, lame, and just plain stupid book","This book got on my nerves. I absolutely hated it, and couldn't bare to read anymore about halfway through. If you want a horribly boring experience, go on, read it. If not, stay away from this book. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,"Kinda surprised, these are pretty decent quality","They are a bit rough to the touch, not entirely sheer, but they also seem to hold up well and don't run easily. The size was true and the reinforced toe is a nice touch. It seems from reviews that finding decent colored stockings for playware at a reasonable price is difficult. These fit the bill for me."
2,Does not maintain proper humidity,"Using it for 2 month. I have about 30% humidity in my apartment all the time.Primed humidor as per instructions. Humidity went down to 50% pretty quickly. Then I read that it's better to fill it with cigars. So I filled it in with cigars which were about 70% humidity. Two weeks later and it was back to 55%.Left it overnight in the balcony open when it was ~80% humidity. In the morning it was showing 75%. Two weeks later - 50%. I open the box only once per 2-3 days.I gave 1 extra start just because the box itself looks good. But not more than that..Also, there is no screw in my hygrometer which came with the box, thus I could not calibrate it (need to remember the difference)."
1,Hygrometer arrived with severly cracked glass,"seems like a nice box, was excited to take out of the box and use. Then i pulled the hygrometer out of its box, and it came fresh with broken glass. Amazon doesn't offer replacement of this product. To big a hassel to return for the price, will probably just live with broken glass or buy a new hygro on my own."
4,It'll grow on 'ya!,"Plant Life has everything you want in an engaging novel: warmth, humor, quirky characters, a small town you'd like to visit, and some down-home observations about life and love. Thoroughly enjoyable! As an author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL, I especially appreciated the loving and complex bonds between mothers and their children. Plant yourself on the front porch, put your feet up, and head south!"
2,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FILM 2 1/2 STARS,"There is plenty of action in the sequel to the excellent Blade,but it just doesn't hold up to the first film. The sequel does have some cool FX,but the story just seems silly. It is better than some other Marvel movie that have been done though."
2,"Blade 2, the first Blade was better","All in all roughly put this movie was ok. I didnt like the face That I could spot the weak CG special effects off the movie. And one of the best characters 'Snowman' had a small part in the movie and was killed off. The plot was thin, its like people wanted a Blade movie, and they got this, semi-ok movie. The first one was alot better. All in all go watch a good movie like Black Hawk Down."
2,I still can't believe this film was a hit!!,"The original Blade was a much better film. Blade I's story was solid and the characters quite interesting. I expected the sequel to be even better but unfortunately it relied too much on uninteresting special effects, the wrestling scenes were a joke, and gore. The character Whistler had much more dialogue and actual ""Character"" in the first Blade film as did Blade himself. The Vampires (The Blood Pack) in Blade II were in no way frightening or even semi believable. Ron Perlman was good in City of lost children and Enemy at the gates and is obviously a better actor than portrayed in Blade II. The first couple of minutes of the film was great with the ""blood bank"" scenes in the train station but it quickly went down hill with a thud. Buy the original and get a memory wipe in regards to Blade II (I hope Blade III gets this series back on track)."
4,Better Budget = Better Effects,"`Blade II' was one of the few movies that escaped the classic pit-fall of ""part twoers,"" it did not disappoint. The action sequences were eye widening and the new improved vampire dissolve effects were welcomed. The story line was clearly written and had a few well enjoyed twists. If you came to see Blades' car, you will be disappointed, as it holds all of 8 seconds of the movies frames. Sound was well mastered and the CGI animation impressive, however, this is not a soundtrack worthy of the same recognition of `Blade I' fame. I tend to buy part two's, part three's, etc., purely for the satisfaction in owning a complete series, but in this case, `Blade II' won't suffer from ""shelf dust."" If you enjoyed the first `Blade,' buy this DVD."
2,A Big Yawn,"If your taste runs to the sophomoric ideation such as the WWF and that ilk, by all means, run to see the film. However, if you are seeking a storyline that isn't interrupted every few minutes with inane martial arts, puffed up chit chat, and an accompanying Rap soundtrack, avoid it.The best bet with this is to rent it first. Personally it was a money waster for me and I regret buying it based on the original Blade without having seen this sequel first. It won't hold up well on repeated viewings the way the first one does.When all is said and done, this film seeks to financially cash in on the Rap/Hip Hop culture and the many anime/martial arts fans while dressing it up in a pseudo-vampire theme.Those associated with this film should be embarrassed to have lent their questionable talents to its creation.Better luck next time New Line!"
5,Blade is the man!,Blade 2 is a awesome movie the whole series is awesome. Wesley Snipes is the only man to do the job of killing vampires. When it comes to kill the mutant creature that came from another vampire he is the man to do the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and start kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it everyday for the rest of your lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume.
3,Even the monsters have monsters,"Blade 2 doesn't disapoint. There is Hong Kong action, a plot twist and did I say action? Who is to decide the greater of two evils? Blade must decide in the best interests of humanity. Will the enemy of his enemy be his friend? Like it or not we all face hard choices and hope for a good ending. One thing we can count on in Blade, his adamant integrity to the protection of the innocent, and I guess that is the best we can hope for in all peoples."
3,"I liked most of the moviebut wrestling moves, COME ON!!!","I was enjoying the movie but the scene, in which Blade does a WWF wrestling move, ruined it for me. I was left snickering with half of the audience. Also when his partner throws him the shades and he catches it perfectly. All of this is too campy for a movie that takes itself seriously. The effects are good ang the action sequences are enjoyable. But please next time leave the wrestling to cheesy guys in tights."
3,Not as good as first; average at best...,"First was new, original, and exciting. We didn't know in the first one that Blade could destroy a room full of 500 vampires by himself, but in the sequel we pretty much get the idea that he is like that dude 'michael'.For those geeks who keep talking about Donnie Yen, yes he is awesome. He actually gets about 10 minutes in this movie before he is the first killed off."
3,Decent sequel but falls short.,"This is a very watchable vampire sequel but falls short in many ways to the first movie.The suped up vampires didnt really strike a cord with me and i was wishing the director kept to the traditional vampire myths.The pack of 'death dealers' were also unexciting and every member fit a stereotypical action role from the Asian ninja to the tough as nails scruffy guy to the towering mass of muscle guy.The main villain, Nomak, was pretty good but paled in comparison to Deacon Frost. And the main female role in this movie was very sub par. Actually, all female roles have been extremely sub par in the Blade series... and hopefully this will change with Jessica Biel in Blade 3."
2,Snipes is back in action,"Blade II (2002) Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlman, Luke Goss, Leonor Varela, Norman Reedus, Thomas Kretschmann, D: Guillermo del Toro. Loud, bloody, slice-and-dice retread to the loud, bloody, slice-and-dice predecessor again has Marvel Comics' wisecracking night warrior, The Day Walker defeating vampires. This time, he sides with a band of his hard-hitting enemies to take on something they both have never encountered: a vicious super-vampire that is making its own type of vampires. Spectacular special effects and style, which are more confident this time, get in the way of the mythology of vampires and crucially the story; the movie also turns mind numbing and grotesque. Running Time: 117 minutes and rated R for strong persuasive violence, language, some drug use, and sexual content."
5,An excellent album from an excellent band.,It is incredible that one band could be this good. These are the songs that were considered the throwaway tracks and they are still considerably better than most other bands at their peak. It's Good to be Free might be the best rock song of the 90's while songs from Half the World Away to Acquiesce demonstrate the bands range. A must have for anyone who enjoys good music.
5,Fine CD if I may say so,This was the first CD of Oasis I purchased and since then I own all of the 3 others. This CD was quality music one of the best CDs ever made by one of the best bands ever. If you don't own it buy it.
2,The airbrush didn't last.,"My daughter is still having a good time drawing on tatoos and putting on the glitter. Yet, the airbrush has been a disappointment.The airbrush gave a nice fine mist the first few days of use. After 3 weeks, the pens hardly work in the sprayer. We have been carefull to tightly recap the pens. Even tried storing the pens in different positions to see if it made a difference. If they work, it's a few dark scattered dots. The pens still work for drawing on the doll, but the color is very dark and unmake-up like. We have also found that the pens do not wash of of the skin with soap. They leave a stain that must wear off."
1,Terrible,Kidnapping. Rape. Torture. Defiling a Corpse. Think of Texas Chainsaw or the Hills Have Eyes set in a Soviet apartment. More flies. More graphically intense. Really disturbing. No relief. No humor black or otherwise. I was bothered by this movie and I love horror and have a very dark sense of humor but this had no redeeming qualities and stayed with me for days.
2,"Hum-Drum, Ridiculous Psuedo-Erotica","This film is supposedly an erotic thriller but it turns out to be only a mess. Linda Fiorentino lacks the presence and sex appeal of Sharon Stone or even Nicole Kidman. Chaz Palmentari is cadaver-like and David ""Who Needs NYPD Blue"" Caruso in no leading man. And the cast is just the beginning of the problems. The plot and script are silly though Director William Freidkan tries in vain to raise the suspense. There are some unintentional momemts of humor: the blackmail photos of Richard Crenna have obviously been doctored to give him a seemingly buffed body and the ""erotic"" scene with Fiorentino, a stranger, and some panty hose is so poorly staged it's a riot."
4,Smaller than expected,"Very nice, but this runs real small. I ordered 2, one small and one XL, The XL would be about a medium. Hope this helps others when ordering."
5,joe haldeman,If you enjoy the Science Fiction of Joe Haldeman...I guarantee you will enjoy this collection of his essays and short stories!
1,"I ordered this a month ago, still waiting",today is September 12th and I still haven't gotten my movie. I want my money back
2,"Not as Good as the Original: ""The Longest Yard""","This entire movie, including the title, were ""borrowed"" from an earlier piece, as were dialogue, settings and plot. If you have seen or see now, ""The Longest Yard"" starring Burt Reynolds, you will see for yourself how much of TLY was scavenged to produce this flagrant rip-off. Tracy Keenan Wynn conceived and wrote the original, TLY, and should have had screen credit for this, except for the fact that it pales in comparison, and as such, is probably better left attributed to the ""borrowers."" No honor among thieves, even in Hollywood, or should I say, ESPECIALLY in Hollywood. See ""The Longest Yard"" instead, a much better film, and ORIGINAL."
2,The Longest Yawn,"The original ""The Longest Yard"" and the lame Adam Sandler remake are better than ""Mean Machine"". So is ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Kicking and Screaming"". Vinnie Jones made an auspicious debut in a bit part as a debt collector in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". Asked to shoulder the heft of a starring role Jones just doesn't have the acting heft. His co-stars in director Guy Ritchie's debut film(Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vas Blackwood)run circles around him in this vehicle. Truth be told soccer holds as much interest to me as grass growing. That said I'm not a hockey fan but I loved ""Slapshot"". Regardless, the most indelible thing on display here is David Hemings' pointy eyebrows. The European title for this film was ""The Mean Machine"". These kind of subtleties make a world of difference."
4,Easy going film!,"This is one of the two remakes of The Longest Yard, since the last one (2005) the starring is Adam Sandler.In this particular version we have the british humor all along the film with its typical cynicism and enjoyable references to known celebrities.Good entertainment!"
3,technical review,"Others who are more knowledgable than I have reviewed the content of this disk and I agree with them for the most part. Let me address the technical issues. First the picture is mediocre at best. This is a video source from several years back and it shows. Things get lost in the blacks and the picture is very soft. Second, the surround tracks are very disorienting with the voices occasionally issuing from the rear speakers for no reason that i can determine. I would love to see these companies start putting out disks that at least SOMEWHAT live up to the capabilities of the format."
1,This is NOT beginner level and has scant information!,"If you are searching for a beginner-level book in order to learn enough Swedish to enjoy visiting the country, don't waste your money on this book and tape like I did!!Although the audio tape included with this book is a good way to get a feel for how Swedish sounds, it is definitely not at a beginner level. The book does not have enough detailed information for someone who has no prior background in a Scandanavian language to be able to learn this language without lots of extra help (and having learned Spanish and Japanese previously, I found them both MUCH easier to learn than this book made learning Swedish)."
3,Not fair for me to review.,"Sorry, but I did not finish this book, though I read most of it and checked the index. Just a personal opinion, but I found it boring."
2,Very disappointing,"This film was highly recommended to me by a couple of people who know movies and usually have great taste but I didn't enjoy it at all. The concept was pretty good but it just doesn't deliver. The characters are stylized in a way that just doesn't grab you in, the writing, direction and editing feel slapped together and the voice overs are interminable, not funny and don't move the story along. The script also throws in some ugly and gratuitous scenes/language to try to perk your interest but it just cheapens it further. The movie comes across as a very poor man's ""American Beauty"". Do yourself a favor and skip it."
1,Thin plot shored up by sex and failure. Depressing !,The irony of the plot is lost in the in your face and constant display of sex which really has no place in the movie other than to shock you and depress you over how willingly the characters choose to ruin their lives.
2,This is like two movies in one.,"My brother told me that this was the funniest movie of the year, so I rented it. I just didn't find very much humor in it. I felt like I was watching two movies at once. The one about the high school election was at least interesting, but the one about the teachers and their wives was dull and unbelievable. A true mixed bag."
1,Immoral Garbage,"You're thinking, 'Matthew Broderick & Reese Witherspoon this ought to be a good movie.' WRONG. That's what I was thinking. The fact that MTV Films produced this movie should have been enough of a warning. Election is not funny, nor clever, nor interesting. All the major characters are immoral bad people doing immoral bad stuff. I am not a prude and if this movie was entertaining in anyway I could have set aside my judgement of the characters. However, it is not entertaining, nor do any of the characters show remorse or grow in anyway. There is nothing redeming about this movie.Please don't waste your time."
3,Undisciplined storytelling,"This movie was most interesting when it focused on the battle between the girl Tracy, her opponent and the principal. But there were way too many bizarre tangents and peripheral characters that turned the movie into a freakshow."
5,Great Movie!,A great dark comedy. One of Reese Witherspoons' best movies. I need ten more words for this review. Movies are good!
4,Great Experience,This book arrived on a timely manner and in real good condition. It was exactly what they said it would be in their description. Wouldn't mind doing business with them again in the future!
5,"""making lemons out of lemonade","I bought Baghdad Cafe because it is a quiet story about transformation and about a human being's ability to transform their life into something magic. In small ways there are wonderful visual allusions to classical transformation stories. The performances of the entire cast are wonderful. This is an upbeat and joyful film - rarity among films filled with violence, and despair."
4,Good product,Everything was fine with this DVD. The condition was sufficiently good. Great movie about one of the major attractions on Route 66.
4,Bagdad Cafe,This movie is a little different but good to watch something out of the ordinary now and then. Movie was in great condition (new) and arrived on time.
5,"Funny, quirky and poetic","This is one of my favorite movies, and I bought this one as a gift for a friend. The characters and quirky story line present a poetic and humorous look at the basic human complexity that connects us all. It is inspiring in its ability to emphasize our similarities in spite of apparent differences."
2,oddballs,"you know the story from the other reviewers..i had wanted to watch this for some time and finally did. to my surprise, there is no story, only quirky characters coming together; as if....and i have lived in the desert as well as odd locations....yes, they become friends, and yes strange locations made for unusual friends, but this was a very long and uninteresting movie with the exception of the scenery. save your time and spend it with your family."
3,Written like a police detective procedural.,"This is a wry tale of a married couple and the man's best friend. It is told from the friend's point of view. While it deals with emotions and relationships, the prose style reminds me of a police detective procedural. I enjoyed both the style and the book, but it is simply not an outstanding work of art. One major drawback is that the husband is such an unlikable and uninteresting ""baby"", as his own wife characterizes him. If the book can be said to have a point, it is that the weight of a relationship's history can instill a sense of obligation and closeness even after the affection has been lost."
1,Great season but instant video has bad encoding and a missing episode,"Overall a great season, and many kudos to a great production effort, But there seems to be problems, at least with the Amazon Instant Video versions of Star Trek . . .In a significant number of episodes across the entire Star Trek series on Amazon instant video; i have found the play back to be stuttered and jerky. Some even seem to have reversed interlacing (but that may be my imagination.) The worst, and probably the best examples of this problem, are the season 5 episodes ""The Game"" and ""A Matter of Time"". I find the effect very distracting and uncomfortable. It basically ruins the product.. To add insult to injury; The Season 5 episode ""Conundrum"" is missing ""unavailable"" ""due to licensing"" from Amazon Instant video . I know sometimes things go wrong but really, what's up with the goofy encoding problems? Send me the master and let me take a crack at it, maybe I could or maybe not, but you never know."
3,Conundrum,"As the other reviewer mentions, this episode is missing sound effects. Which is too bad because it's a great episode. Hopefully Amazon will correct this at some point."
1,FOR 3D BLU-RAY ONLY!!,"Gents,i bought this blu-ray, but when i tried to play in regular blu-ray player, after played 12 tracks the disc was 'frooze' and i couldnt see anything. So, this blu-ray just work in 3D blu-ray only."
4,Great quality and effort,"I bought this as my second Scorpions concert disc, after Wacken Live Open Air 2006. I have not been able to view this in 3D yet, but on my regular tv screen it shows great. Only after looking at the making of it on the bonus reel does one get a true impression of how monumentous a task putting this together must have been. Given the size of the crowd, they really need to sell a lot of these to start turning a profit when one thinks of how expensive it is to record, edit and master an entire concert in 3D.I would have given 5 stars, but somehow the atmosphere doesn't compare to the Wacken concert...the fans didn't seem to get into it as much...maybe the demographic was different, as I saw a lot of more mature folk in this, as opposed to at Wacken. But then again, maybe I need to get those 3D glasses..."
4,Excellent Set- But,"I bough this set, and love it. A trip to the past for me, and worth every penny. Quality is excellent. Only one minor point-Season 2 is a bit different than I remember from childhood, it repeatedly shows a nearly complete nude view of Dana Sterling in the shower many times over. Fine by me. But if you have a curious 10 year old boy in the house? Just be aware that adult content does find it's way into this cartoon series."
2,what I ordered.,I got the title I ordered and it is fine. However I received two of the same title and I only wanted one. I notice I was also billed for two. Can I sent one copy back and get another movie?
2,Weak,"I bought this movie on recommendation from other customers here on Amazon.com ... okay, I bought this movie because Viggo Mortensen was in it :O)And boy, I just shouldn't have bothered. What a weak script. The characters are formulaic, the dialogue wooden and cliched. There are no surprises, no insights - I came away from this movie not caring if the entire camp blew up.Perhaps this is a difference in cultures, I'm not sure, but as an Australian I found this movie to be sickeningly Disneyesque in its portrayals. Not worth wasting an hour-and-a-half of your time over - even for Viggo."
4,A Walk I would like to take,"I happened upon this movie without ever have hearing anything about it. I too think that Diane Lane is one of the best of hollywood actors. Julia Roberts cannot hold a candle to her. This movie made me wish for a simpler world, where children were children and not made to grow up too fast. I was born in1972 so I didn't get to experience the sixties first hand, but I always listened to the music and have wished that I could have been around for the free love. This movie also made me see how my mother must feel. She too got married at a very young age. It's also nice to see a mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationship be so honest. Hats off to diane and to the rest of this fine cast."
4,Just what I was looking for!,I love this case! It was just want I wanted & didn't cost $20. The jelly-silicone covering provides perfect protection for my iPod and is easy to slide on and off. It has openings so I can still charge it and dock it on my stereo when the cover is on. It comes with a screen protector which is great. This is definately a great bargain product!!! I'm glad I chose it over the 20 somethin dollar leather case. ; )
5,Who knew praising God could have such a phat beat???,"This album is tight. The lyrics are unbelievable, the beats are just awsome! I especially like ""Test It"", it's got a good message and a dope beat. I also own ""House of Represenatives"", and the album by the Ambassador (from Cross Movement) called ""Christology"". You gotta check this out!"
1,Propaganda.,Fine acting and good photography wasted. This film pretends to be a study of fidelity until the girlfriend starts a threesome with the mom and her boyfriend. While watching Kate Beckensale kissing Frances McDormand you discover the film is saying that all women are repressed lesbians. This is not true at all but obviously is the fantasy of the writer. It is gross and proposterous to see a man's girlfriend cheat on him with his Mom. What were they thinking?!
2,broken cookies,"I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad."
3,"Pretty paintings, few examples","I ordered this book online because I like the style of the cover art. Flipping through it, I enjoy almost all of the paintings, many being flower landscapes. But the book gives very few tips beyond the pictures, and there are no true works-in-progress or step-by-step instructions. Sometimes the artist will include a picture of the first rough sketch, but otherwise the pictures are all of final paintings. The book might be good to give seasoned painters a little inspiration, but if you're looking for a how-to, this book isn't the one."
5,Terrific Travel Hair Dryer,"I really love this dryer. It is lightweight and easy to manage. I also liked that it came with a travel case, although it seems bigger than it needs to be.The only complaint I have is that there isn't an option to purchase an attachment to more easily direct the air flow (I don't know what it is offically called)."
1,Don't waste your money on the Lavendar scent,Lavender scent was extremely mild/weak. It's completely useless even in a small enclosed bathroom.Gardenia scent was much better/stronger. Don't waste your money on the Lavender scent.
1,Extremely Limited Range of Fragrance,"I am very disappointed in the two fragrance diffusers which I purchased. Their scents were very pleasing, however, what good is a diffused scent if it's limited range is only two feet? I have used Essenza scent diffusers, and they really work well. They will fill an entire room with a fragrance or scent, whereas Candle Bay reed diffusers which I tried do NOT fill a room with fragrance. I do not recommend this product. I suppose the expression, ""You get what you pay for"" is quite true in the matter of reed scent diffusers. Incidentally, the gardenia fragrance I purchased was the 8.Fl size, the Indian Chai only 2.Fl."
3,lock bolt,"the bolt and lock pin is a good looking machining job. but the nut does not go on easy. the first bolt had to be sent back because the nut when you tried to remove it got stuck immediatly upon backing it off. it had to be cut off with a cutting tool. before i put the replacement on i tried the nut and i ran into the same trouble. but i didn't turn it on all the way. i turned in a few turns and then backed it off and then turned it on a little farther till i reached the shoulder of the bolt. then it worked ok. why it does that, i don't know. it works fine and is doing its job that it was meant for."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this CD based on the reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, I'm not that impressed. The playing is good, but seems to lack a bit of soul. Both the vocals and the songs lack variety so it gets a bit monotonous after a few cuts. The production also seems a bit shallow or sparse which might be fine if his playing was more compelling. All in all, listening to this CD is like catching Johnny Winter on an off day."
1,I don't get this movie,"I guess this movie is supposed to be funny, but to me, it was awful. My husband agreed. Maybe we just didn't get it?It wasn't that the humor was too gross or weird, it just was not funny. Again, I'll add that maybe we just aren't cool enough to understand this film, but we cut it short about 2/3 of the way through because we just couldn't take anymore. Only about 5 films ever, that I didn't watch the entire thing and this has now been added to that distinguished list.I'll add, I was really surprised to see Michael Clarke Duncan in such a rotten movie. I guess we all have got to earn a living!"
1,pass on this one,I have reviewed this before but I guess they didn't like my negative review. Very low budget film with terrible actors and stupid story line.
2,silly,This movie was silly and often downright stupid. There were a few laughs but the plot was silly and contrived. The acting was mediocre. The movie takes place inside the Slammin Salmon Restaurant which must show an absurd revenue in one night--especially given that the owner comps customers while expecting the servers to compete to tally the highest tabs. I would really have to recommend passing on this one.
2,"Some bits are funny, but too much use of the ""F"" word for me","Naked butts, extensive use of the ""F"" word, overall not a movie for me, I prefer comedy that can be funny without being offensive"
2,Not very good,Broken Lizard's comedies tend to be uneven and this one is no exception. Much of the material falls flat and the good jokes aren't plentiful enough to make this more than a rental at best. If you loved all the other films they've made then you will probably love this one too. If you thought the quality has been slipping then this will confirm that the trend continues.
5,"Ten times better than ""Waiting""","This is by far one of the funniest and best movies you have probably never herd off. Produced by the same people who made super troopers, this is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good comedy.I work in a high end Las Vegas restaurant and I can tell you that all my coworkers love this movie and we often use some of the hilarious quotes in our conversations. Give this movie a shot, you wont be disappointed!"
1,"Pure Schlock or Please Come Back James Mason, James Mason","The only thing this movie has going for it are the special effects, after that forget it. In the original, which had surprisingly good special effects, we have the more important element of characterization and a great storyline, all true to Jules Verne's vision. Add to that a terrific cast with the always great James Mason in the lead, and you have all the makings for a great film.In THIS schlock of a film we have cardboard characters that only make you plead for them to wind up in the jaws of a dinosaur. (Sigh) They just don't make em like they used to.James Mason we need you!"
3,Hmmmm....,"I think we're at cross-purposes here. This movie should not be confused with or compared to the Jules Verne classic, which starred Pat Boone and other great actors. But, when you put a mini-series on DVD, you get the feel where they cut for commercials and cut for the next episode etc. This makes for a jumpy, quirky viewing experience. I just have fun with this movie, pure & simple. It's not a great work or anything resembling 'art'.....just a fun romp through a rather campy fare with some wonderful moments & characters, that sometimes don't even tie into the main plot!"
1,Wait For The 1959 Film,I don't understand why Fox or whomever owns the rights to the 1959 production of this Jules Vernes adventure has not realease it on DVD- the film was shot in spectacular cinemascope and must be seen letterboxed- Bernad Herrmans amazing score deserves the full stereo treatment- and the movie it self one of my all time favorites is a must for every science fiction- adventure- kid friendly collection
2,Go Classic,"Both these movies have some family entertainment value. I'm not sure I would recommend you buy them unless you all ready have the original movies with these names. These newer versions probably had bigger budgets but they don't hold a candle to the classic 1959 version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with James Mason, Arlene Dahl, and Pat Boone and the 1963 version of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" with Todd Armstrong and Nancy Kovack."
2,Sci Fi,"Based on Jules Vernon's classic novel. Trip into realms of the unknown, Casper searches for her husband. They find an undiscovered world. He's nowhere to be found. Don't waste your time on this, but maybe a mediocre rental flick. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great Fun I Loved it,"With a great cast and timeless story,this T.V. version of the old classic is great all the way.I Found it wounderfully intoxicating and lots of fun.An adventure for the whole family."
4,I liked it,I kind of only bought it for the sacred hoop song but some of the other tracks are pretty cool. Alot of it is old late 90s stuff which I liked. Some of the songs are just djs showing off there scratching but I think most of them do have words. IT has alot of stuff you have hard time finding these days on there original releases
2,Maybe I expected more,"Myabe I am too much of an amateur, because a lot of this book just goes over my head. That said, it seems to contain a lot of information, but I'm not just sure for who."
4,"Charming, sweet, somewhat surreal throwback to silent films","The three filmmakers are also all professional clowns, and about 85% of the film is without dialogue.Shot in a theatrical, low budget way, it recalls a smaller, less ambitious and philosophical Roy Andersson.It made me laugh out loud a couple of times, and smile a good deal. However, even at 84 minutesit did start to drag by the end, and some of the bits started to wear thin. None-the-less, thisis a lovely, worthwhile experimental nod to Chaplin, Keaton, et al, if not quite on their level ofgenius. But then, who is?"
1,And a great resounding snore was heard around the world,"... and the people went into hibernation for two years to wait for the next useless Pink Floyd remasters.Ziggy Stardust releases.., 2012 Remaster, 2002 30th Anniversary...2003 remaster, 1999 Enhanced, 1990 Au20... nothing new people...move along."
1,YUCK!,"Look I'll be brutally honest with you. I used to be a Bowie fan a few years ago, but now he's become my pet hate. It's not just because he's the biggest weed of all time, but also because that very weediness is reflected in his limp music.Besides that he can't utter more than two words without making an absolute idiot of himself. Remember when he did the Lord's Prayer at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert? Isn't that the most embarrassing thing you've ever seen?I don't know if David Bowie or Pink Floyd should get the award for The Most Prentious Tripe Of All Time."
3,S. Wattie,Be forewarned. I bought this item soley for the DVD of the album music. It will not play in my Acura ZDX. It is not a video DVD but should be superior DVD quality music; just wish I could listen to it.
4,Great Music - Poor Packaging,"""Ziggy Stardust"" is one of the greatest rock 'n roll albums ever and this collection is worth the celebration. Finely remastered, the entire CD is crisp and perfect. The 12 additonial songs of demos and B-sides are great period pieces. ""Velvet Goldmine"", ""Sweet Head"" and the outtakes of ""Moonage Daydream"" are nothing less than ear candy.However, all of this could have been released on a single CD. There is no need (other than quantity) to put all the extra songs on an additonal disc. The liner notes are detailed and fun, but the packaging is cardboard and mine is already falling apart, much like the ill-fated gem rerelease of George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"".It's classic music, but the price is far too much to pay. It's also worth noting that for the 30th anniversary , Bowie only sang one song from this album in his 2002 summer tour with MOBY. What's up with that? We still 'luv ya' David!"
4,Glam Classic,"The early 1970's: hippie fashion was dying, heavy metal was beginning, and the British glam rock craze was at its peak. This weird mix of pop and hard rock was all the rage at this time. And nobody did it better than David Bowie. Bowie's mix of piano, heavy guitars, and saxophones made a perfect mix. And on this album, he probably hit his peak. This is a concept album about an alien rock star who wins the hearts of all who hear his voice. Some of then tracks are really weird like the opener, Five Years, which is about the destruction of the Earth or something like that. The most pop tracks are 'Soul Love' and 'Lady Stradust'. The most rock tracks are 'Suffragette City', 'Star', and the title track. This is a glam rock classic and everyone should own it."
5,Pure David Bowie,This is the album that has changed my life and I guess the lives of many others. Pure rock 'n roll by an ARTIST !
1,Do Not Waste Your Time and Money,"This tape contains NO ACTUAL PAST LIFE REGRESSIONS. It is the content of a seminar Weiss gave minus the regressions. When you get to side four you find out that the author keeps the good stuff (the actual regressions) for his clients. What he does share is other ways to discover your past lives, including things such as dreams (duh!). You get to hear some stories of people who did some past life regressions successfully, all about the author's credentials, and some audience questions from the conference he gave. If you want a tape that takes you on a past life regression this is not it. For me it was a total waste of time and money."
5,great product,"I use Program to treat members of an outside cat colony for which I am one of the caretakers. Fleas are bad this year in Texas and these cats are semi-feral and really impossible to handle. However, I can prepare a small bit of tasty food containing a dose of Program and watch to verify that the cat has eaten the dose. One cat whose skin had bloody spots from flea allergies completely recovered in about a month's time. New hair grew back and he's his old beautiful self again. I treat all cats in the colony, one by one, each month during the warm months. If a cat has an active flea problem, I dose with Capstar, also available from Amazon, the first day to kill the fleas, then follow monthly with Program."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY TWO CATS AND IT DID NOTHING FOR THIER FLEA PROBLEM. ENDED UP BUYING ADVANTAGE, WHICH I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE,OH,WELL LIVE AND LEARN."
1,Disappointed,"The service was prompt but we were very disappointed in the quality of the costume. The material is extremely flimsy and the costume is poorly made.Due to the cost of return S&H;, we unfortunately will have to keep it."
4,Music conquers over politics,"The repertoire was not the best, but the opportunity to view this historic concert makes this DVD worth the purchase price and more. It is a rare glimpse into this closed society and of how music definitely is a universal language. Congrats to all involved in making this concert happen and in making it avalable to all those of us who will most likely never get a chance to visit Pyongyang. Image and sound were very good so the viewing experience is most satisfying. Enjoyed the special feature almost as much as the concert itself, although it makes it very evident that brainwashing is alive and well in North Korea. Sadly, North Koreans seem terrified to speak (like the beauty who could not utter a single word when interviewed) and those music students who dared to speak made it a point to say that they could learn nothing new from the visiting musicians because their teachers were just as good. Really sad."
3,Hits the high spots(really well) skips a few.,"Well, being a some what regular user of lightwave the first chapter was useless to me, Dave Jerrard did a wonderful job explaining all there is to know about texturing. Half the book is using Gradients and layer textures, just what I was after. Plus he goes into great detail when it comes to bones and ways to get them to morph the object just right. However he barely touches weight maps, Sasquatch(oh come on its a hair generator next time give a tuto on the best ways to render and model human hair.) and there is very little on lightwave 7.0. Very little.But this book is wonderful for n00b's. They will find it very helpful. I myself have found it to be helpful but lacking in a few areas..."
3,"Good tutorials, but it's missing too much!","The book is divided into 10 tutorials. Each tutorial covers its section well, but I felt that there is A LOT of important topics it doesn't discuss AT ALL!It goes over BASIC polygon modeling, a lot on textures lighting, creating landscapes, BASIC animation, and bones.It has no, or very little info on advanced modeling tools (splines, meatballs, etc), more useful animation techniques, and image mapping. Each chapter starts by havinf you load a pre-made model off the CD-ROM, but it never tells you how you would go about making the model!! The chapter on animation is extremelely basic.I would only recommend this book to someone looking for a book on special topics in Lightwave. It's missing too much stuff."
1,the most useless dictionary I have ever had the misfortune to own,"Admittedly, mine is the third edition, but let me say at least half the words in whose definitions I take an interest are not included in this most disappointing of the Oxford dictionaries. One must bear in mind that it catalogs Current English; as such, anyone except perhaps the most remedial student of English as a foreign language would do better to acquaint himself with ""words, phrases, and definitions"" elsewhere, perhaps in a still smallish dictionary containing more than 120,000 items, as those 120,000 have proven grossly insufficient. In response to this betrayal by ""the world's most trusted dictionaries,"" the literate should have no truck with the third edition and steer clear of the fourth."
3,Tradition,"Patti's writing, both credible and competent, structured far more conventional than I expected, reading more like an homage to tradition than a confrontation towards form."
4,Good Deal,"This is a good rock album. Lit sounds a lot like Greenday, Offspring and Blink 182 only a little more popular. If you like any of those bands I highlt recomend it. This is a great deal considering it has the 3 bonus songs and a video AND it's cheeper then the regular one. Go out and buy it if you're into pop rock."
2,This cd is a big let-down,"I made a big mistake buying this album. I loved their last album(A place in the sun) so much, that I bought this CD without even listening to it online first. The things I liked about the last album(the lyrics and guitar playing) are gone. Some of the songs sound good, but the lyrics are really annoying. I mean, who cares if you took her out on a Friday night and got smashed? The lyrics are so blunt; they are pathetic. Embedded in them are so many cliches, that the lyrics to the songs get annoying. The lyrics are not something you would want to catch yourself singing in the shower. If you want a good CD, go buy ""A place in the sun"", or try Blink 182 or New found glory. At least Blink and New Found Glory sing about something worthwhile."
4,South Pacific - original '49 B'way cast CD,"Relax and spend ""Some Enchanted Evening"" with Mary Martin, Ezio Pinza, and the original 1949 cast of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic ""South Pacific."" The catchy, familiar tunes will have you singing along in your car. With informative liner notes and a couple of songs that didn't make later recordings, this CD makes an enjoyable addition to the collection of any fan of the great Broadway musicals."
3,"Great images, a little pricey for what you get","I love space, I love 3D IMAX productions, and I love 10+ minutes of this 45 minute documentary, but I don't love the price. It just doesn't seem right that you pay the same for a 2 hour movie for a documentary thats under an hour.. Fortunately the prices on Amazon are better than you'd find in a store, but even so.. Half of the video is sort of filler too, so I have to give this 3 stars."
2,Bad Sound,"I wanted to hear the narration and the words of the astronauts, but the music drowned out everything. This is a problem I have found with a lot of DVDs lately. The music is supposed to be in the background, and the spoken words should be audible, but they got it backwards. I wonder if it was like this in the movie theater, or is this just sloppy transferring at the disc level? The images, though, are wonderful. Sharp and clear. I wanted to see more of the Hubble pictures, too. There was too much of the suiting up and so on, and not enough space photos. -"
5,Truly awesome,"Not sure what the other people who gave this video poor reviews are watching or seeing but this video is awesome. I originally saw it in an IMAX theater at the Wright Patterson Air Force museum and it was FAR FAR better than looking at any pictures on some website. I've watched countless documentaries on space, going to the moon, etc and although this is the shortest, it also had the biggest WOW factor for me. It does document a large portion of the astronauts experience while fixing the Hubble but that's fine by me. My favorite parts are the shuttle launch and soaring through galaxies as if you're in a plane flying at thousands of light years a second."
3,Rather expensive for what you get,I guess I expected more space views and views from the Hubble for the price paid. It was interesting to watch once but I don't feel it was worth the cost.
5,Amazing 3d adventure,One of the best 3d documental i have seen. The translation also in spanish is excellent made. I recommend this movie to all fans of astronomy.
4,wish it was blu ray and longer,I'll let you know how well I like this when it comes out on blu ray. If you have a good surroud system the lift off scene at high volume is the bomb!
1,not worth the money,very poor movie who ever wrote the script and directed this needs to go back to school very poorly writtenthis movie is very very slow as much as I like Decaprio in movies this was far from his best workI am surprised he would put up with the way this was written and as performed
3,Australian Giallo (don't expect a slasher/horror movie),"This movie isn't really violent at all and it is slow paced... it plays out exactly like a Giallo, considering how slow some films of that genre are, you shouldn't be disappointed if you go in thinking this.. if this was an actual Giallo it would probably be considered a very good one. The score is nice and gloomy and theres nothing bad about the performances. It comes to a pretty exciting (and confusing) conclusion."
5,Great history book,"This book is an excellent history of photography. It is not a book of ""how-to"". If you are looking for a concise and readable history, this is a good start."
3,3.5 stars to be exact,"This was an interesting story, sometimes humorous. I think it was a little hard to get into because of some of the language, but it did turn out to be a pretty good read. Not the best, but certainly not the worst that I've read."
5,Beginner's Guide to Afro Lounge...,"I paid $14/US to get this 3-disc set. My favorite song on this 3-disc set is Disc-3/Track-9 (Song: Likufanele/You) by The Mothers & Zero 7. One nice, mellow groove. At 5:53, it's just getting started when it ends - thank goodness for the repeat button!Seriously, it has been forever since I've bought a CD-set where all 3 discs are good! This disc is the best value I've seen thus far in all the years I've been buying CD's.Get yourself a copy of this collection and play it through as I did, discs 1 through 3. You should be pleasantly surprised. It's a collection like this that makes me wish that I had a mp3 format device, I'd burn all three discs onto a single disc. Then I could just 'set it' and 'forget it'!Five stars for this collection - Five stars for Likufanele, my absolute favorite track in this collection! (How come I've never heard of ""Mothers and Zero 7"" before? - My loss, everyone's loss - I think!)"
4,The Great T's review,"This is loads of fun it is Spiderman for god's sake! It makes the evils look like little ants compared to Spidey! It makes you want to play/watch it over and over again! It makes You want to go out there and buy more fantastic toys, videos and even play-suits!..."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I love a good scary movie. Not a movie that just tries to gross me out, but one that makes you hear weird noises in your house while, and after watching it.After reading all the reviews about Henry, I knew I had to have it.The day it arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store. I waited until that night to watch it. Being alone at night watching a killer movie is cool. Needless to say it never even raised a hair on my arm during the entire movie.Maybe I was too hyped up from reading all the other reviews, but the second DVD that came with the set was a lot better than the movie itself.I've watched every movie ever made about serial killers, and mass murderers. I rate this one at the bottom of the list."
2,Fast forward review,"OK, for sex sleaze fans we got two stars, one for the family murder scene, which involves some mostly nude mom in pantyhose molestation, and one for the incest rape from behind while attempting asphyx scene.It would get more, except for not near enough nudity, and not enough sex before the victims get killed, mostly by twisting their necks, which wastes a tremendous amount of sleaze potential (why not at least tie the girls up and take their clothes off, I mean, come on!). It's rather disappointing to make the sicko a prude. I mean, if you're going to make a totally depraved movie that every decent person is going to condemn, why not put more sex in it? Like, you were going to offend someone? Jeesh."
1,Terrible,"I just dont get it. The movie SUCKED--stupid story about one killing after the other with 3 of the same characters throughout this mess, filmed 80% in the same room and talk ,talk and then stab.Please dont waste your money on this crap and dont believe the reviews that this was a great horror/slasher film.After seeing it, I threw it in the garbage--I would be a fool to give it to anyone who would think I was crazy for seeing this trash. STAY AWAY and save yourmoney."
4,Not What It's Made Out To Be But...,"i was a little disappointed after watching this film becaseu of all of the great reviews, but that doesnt mean it was a bad movie because it wasnt what i expeceted Its not nearly as sadistic or cruel as its made out to be but you can still see why people may think that This is a very good movie to show u how a serial killer thinks though so check it out u wont be disappointed if your expecations arnt through the roof"
5,One Of The Best Horror Movies Ever Made,"Henry: Portrait Of A Serial killer is a film that is so real and disturbing. That the Mpaa gave the film a X rating just for how real it was. The film finshed production in 1986 and was in a ratings battle with the Mpaa for 3 years. This film is extremely gory and violent. A lot of people say that Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer isnt as gory as Friday The 13 or slasher films of that nature. But it is way worse than any of those slasher picture the violence is very graphic and gory. The film is not for everyone its not for kids to tell you the truth this movie is for no one under 18 years of age. A great disturbing masterpiece but again not for everyoneWARNING: This Film Is Rated NC-17 For Extremely Graphic Brutal Prolonged Gore and violence, Prolonged Graphic Rape,A Scene Nacrophila, Disturbing Images,Graphic Murder, And Strong Sexuel Images."
3,Mediocre,"Since the first scary movies I saw as a child were things like Freddy and Jason and the gore factors of those movies are so intense honestly this movie was like a Disney flick. Yes, you will see blood and gore but few actual murder scenes. Also if you know any thing about Henry Lucas the real serial killer this movie is extremely historically inaccurate. Like super inaccurate. Basically it's a cult classic for it's time and back then was probably terrifying but it can't hold a candle to today's slasher flicks. If your a band wagon serial killer fan you might want this in your collection. If your a true serial killer fan who studies the phenomenon and the killers then I'd say not a good buy for you. The movies inaccuracies make it intolerable to me."
4,"Brilliant, yet disturbing...","Have you ever been curious about a day in the life of a serial killer? Meet Henry. Why does he kill? He enjoys it. Henry isn't book smart (he can't read) but he knows how to stay one step ahead of the law. Accompanied by dimwitted sidekick Otis, the pair settle into a routine of murder and depravity. Shoestring budget adds to documentary style; excellent performances, powerful and disturbing, but VERY violent. Those concerned should proceed with caution. Filmed in and around Chicago, film plays as a slice of life as seen by a disturbed mind. The DVD includes trailers, facts, and director commentary."
2,"Nothing even remotely REAL, as the box would have u believe","I am having a hard time understanding how exactly anyone could see this movie as anything except a second-rate slasher flick. There is a scene where Henry and Otis kill an extremely overweight man and it ends with Henry smashing a TV onto his head. (and then of course, ""Turn it on, Otis""). Maybe it's just me, but that sounds like any other slasher flick. Dumb and Unreal. And the acting and script were terrible. Example Otis: ""I'm so mad I could kill somebody"" Henry: ""What did you say?"" Otis: ""I'm so mad I could kill somebody"" Henry: ""Let's go for a drive, Otis"" To sum it up, no gore, only one believable killing scene (in the house), bad acting, bad script (and the fact that this was rated NC-17 due to ""tone"" is a load of bull....If it wasn't for this, this film would never have gotten any attention)"
1,HENRY-PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER,"Very dissappointed with this movie. I could not find a plot, just killing for no reason."
4,saw this movie when i was 22 or older or maybe younger,"when i rate this as ' i like it', i'm only commenting on its effectiveness of scaring the crap outta me!i was fascinated with the genre. my girlfriend --at the time; she's now my wife--and i sat down in the cinema and watched all of the people in front of us enjoying their popcorn prior to the movie starting. it took, like, maybe 8 minutes into the movie until pretty much all of everybody who was sitting in front of us snacking on popcorn, bon bons and soda, had left the theatre.tell you what, this movie gave me the creeps; it seemed so real. i left the movie in the end, feeling so uncomfortable--like i was a willing participant (as an observer in something incredibly and inconceivably ugly--that i can't get it out of my mind 20 years hence.i'll never , ever watch it again.it's that trippy. maybe i'm a wimp, but....."
3,Gohan's Secret,"I was a bit disappointed at the lack of fighting in the Great Sayaman saga. I have to admit that there were quite a few funny parts in it,but hardly any fighting. Therefore I rate it with 3 stars."
3,corney episode,It was an ok video. The reason I rated it a three was because it was boring. The second episode was one of the worst DbZ episodes ever. The only real cool part was that we meet Goten and the young Trunks. only buy this if u are really desperate for DBZ.
3,Just okay,"I was looking forward to watching this after reading the reviews and although it was an okay way to fill a couple of hours, overall it disappoints. I could have just as easily done without. I am surprised at the high star ratings, truthfully."
5,Very excited with my purchase,It was sold as used but in great conditions so excited to get started watching my seasons with no interruptions.
2,"Heroes good show, but bad season","I love Heroes show, but this second season i really don't like. Dvd's have very good Bonus Features, good audio commentaries, many deletes escenes, and we have the oportunity to see the missings episodes 12 and 13.In this season, we see new characters, the best new character is Elle (Kristen Bell), and of course last season characters Peter, Nikki, Suresh and Sylar."
5,Love it!,We are addicted to Heroes! We bought all 4 seasons and in just a little over 3 weeks we're almost done with it! I'm so sad. the characters and plots are fast and you have to pay attention - it's an amazing story-line!
4,the Hero magic,the show continues with more twists and turns. I wouldn't recommend anyone trying to jump in without starting with season one first - there are just so many connections and cross connections in this series. Well written and the special effects are great.
2,this is just great,I'm all for the writers getting what they deserve but why didn't they go on strike years ago when Lost and 24 where in production. I wouldn't have missed those shows as much as this season. Although the production quality is amazing it feels extremely rushed and there's way too many cut corners for my taste.grrr! rabble-rabble-rabble...
