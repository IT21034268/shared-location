2,"how about ""RIP OFF""",I was totally jazzed by the hype on internet radio. Bought for 1/5 the retail price which was still 4/5 above normal CD music prices. Totally zero results in my inner well being or other livestyle. So much for NASA recommendations.FEH shame on you romero et al
5,This is the 1st book I've read on Covenant Theology,"This book was a joy to read. It doesn't get bogged down in hard to understand jargon. Dr Horton has a gift at writing. I look forward to digging deeper into Covenantal theology and all it entails. It is a real joy when we as the body of Christ learn the unity of scripture and not the disunity of dispinsationalism, and all that it teaches.Thank you Dr Horton for all you do for the body of Christ."
4,These songs still stand...,"The test of time. ""Homecoming"" is terrific. ""Bad"" is as good as U2 gets live. The studio tracks are okay with ""Love Comes Tumbling"" the highlight. Why didn't it make the album cut?"
5,One of his best,"I have to say that this is one of Asimov's best works in the Galactic Empire series. Others might say that this doesn't fall in the series, but I feel it should be considered to be the first book in the series.I don't think any other author has discussed time manipulation in as much detail as Asimov does in this book. He also refrences a couple of ideas found in his other books. One is the idea of scanning possible timelines to determine the best for humanity. (This was mentioned in ""Foundation and Earth"") Also the Galactic Empire was mentioned, which is the overall idea of the series.This book should be a must read for all Asimov fans."
1,"Way Overpriced for a Fifty Year Old Book!,,,","Again, Macmillan and Tor appear to be selling their back catalogue at ridiculous prices as ebooks in my opinion. This book is 50 years old and the author has been dead for 18 years, yet they expect people to be gullible to pay $11.99 for an ebook that costs about $2.50 to make. What a joke."
2,chrome finish not durable,"I purchased these lug nuts for my truck in the fall of 2010. After one winter (wisconsin here) 8 of the twenty lug nuts show pitting and rust coming thru the chrome. I had hoped to get a few years of service without pitting and rust, and sadly this was not the case. This is why i rate them at 2 stars."
5,A must-have for home video collections!,"This is a great gift for audiophiles who think they've heard (and seen) it all! The Scott and Gary Show presents interviews and performances by some bands who later went on to make it big. The madcap antics of Scott Lewis and Gary Winter, combined with a live studio audience, makes for some very funny footage."
3,Average at beat,Actually this movie quite boring and mundane as far as other westerns I have seen i.e. clint Easwood movies which I love. It does have a few good moments but when I found out that this one is not historically accurate it makes it disappointing worse. The technical production is very good.
4,Gave the Western some class,"Burt Lancaster is Wyatt Earp and Kirk Douglas is Doc Holliday in this take on the famous gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, between the Earps and the Clantons. To its credit the movie is more concerned with the relationship between Earp and Holliday than with the gunfight, though the shootout is well done and pretty exciting. As usual the movie is not too concerned with historical details, but the mythology presented is typical of most good Hollywood westerns. Both Douglas and Lancaster have a quiet dignity about them in their characters, and they make for compelling viewing. Lancaster helps Douglas when he's about to be lynched and later again when Dodge City citizens are about to run him out of town - and Douglas is there for Lancaster when he's most needed. It's a highly entertaining movie, thanks to the strong script written by Leon Uris. Beautifully photographed, too."
3,OK movie,"Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas are reliable movie stars and do a good job of portraying Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, respectively, during the events that led up to one of the most famous encounters in American history. The grudging respect and friendship that grows between the two men is the most interesting part of this film, but this aspect is embedded in a screenplay that is equal parts soap opera and simplistic horse opera. This climactic shootout is well staged."
4,good,"good restoration this is one of the classic movies we enjoy, and I hope you will continue pulling out of valts old westerns like this one I didn't know existed"
1,a greatest hits cd with no greats or hits,"Grace Jones is one of those people who became famous through outrageous stage antics and hairstyles. Her singing career has been an unintentional joke. The first three songs on this album represent the very worst disco had to offer. Not much better on ""Private Life"", a failed attempt to enter 1980's new wave craze. Only on ""Libertango I've Seen That Face Before"" do things get interesting. Here, a sultry Parisian accordian adds a surprisingly nice touch. The rest of the album showcases the very boring or the extremely irritating. Do your blood pressure a favor and avoid this album."
4,insightful,"A very smart interlocutor I met suggested that I read this book. I found the story to be quite insightful, as one could expect from Herman Hesse. However, my favorite piece from the author remains Steppenwulf. Siddharta is too much into spirituality and meditation for my taste. Still a very profound book worth reading."
2,The story line was ok,"I was looking for something comparable to ""The Life of Pi"" and this did not fit the bill. Just could grasp my interest at all."
4,This is a great novel about life,"This book starts out when Siddhartha, a Brahmin's son, leaves his family to find inner peace. Then the book didvides into three parts of his life. The ascetic, which is when siddhartha becomes Samana, the lover, which is when Siddhartha falls in love with Kamala. The final part is the ferryman, where Siddhatha spends the rest of his life searching for inner peace. At the end of the book he finds inner peace and becomes a Buddha. I think Siddhatha was a well rounded character. I like how he was never staisfied with himself and determined to find inner peace. This was a great book to read."
1,You don't get what you pay for...,"This book has a very high price, and is made very cheaply. After using it for 5 minutes, pages are coming out of the binding (this is a paperback that is stitched together). Not what I expect from a $20 paperback!The book refers repeatedly to the audio cassette that accompanies the book for pronunciation. Well, sorry, there is no cassette included; This makes it impossible to use this book to learn to speak or understand Tagalog. In addition, the introduction that gives a guide to pronunciation must be based upon a variation of English I am not familiar with (one of the authors lives in England): the book indicates the vowel 'o' is pronounced 'aw' in Tagalog. Aw heck, I happen to live with a native speaker of Tagalog, and I can tell you that if I relied on this book to learn to speak Tagalog, I would incorrectly pronounce nearly every word!I'm very disappointed with this book!"
5,raging metalhead,this album and spreading the disease are by far the best of anthrax.among the living is where they found the sound.the punk influence is there but all metal.fast and crunchy.
4,Viets Keeps Getting Better,"When you live in St. Louis and share Ms. Viets's fascination with the South Side, naturally you are immeditely drawn to her Francesca Vierling novels. But just as I started thinking all of her books would be uniform, along came the pleasant surprise of Doc-in-the-Box. This book is great entertainment, and manages to make a statement about American health care at the same time. Anyone who has been through an illness or has helped someone through it will definitely see themselves here. She has such a grasp on that, and of course on St. Louis, and I am always expecting to run into Francesca at Hampton Village."
4,Great Fun!,"I bought this toy for my son, 6 years old and he loved it so much.He starts building it up right away. Now he very much likes playing with LEGO toys that he build.I'd recommend this to everyone who is looking for a gift that challenge your love ones."
3,"Fascinating, if a bit over-dramatic","This book was interesting, though I found the author's writing style to be very repetitive. There is much the public doesn't know about ""zoo overpopulation"" but Green clearly picks his words in order to maximize emotional impact. Much of what he reports on isn't actually ""cruel"" or ""inhumane"" - it's just stuff we'd rather not know about the zoo industry."
4,Fun space opera!,"I really enjoyed this series. I found it to be a fast fun space opera that's not too deep. However, it does delve into the whole ""Man's inhumanity to man"" idea quite a bit. It's reminds me of a mix of Star Wars, LOTR and Terminator.This is the first series by Chalker that I have read, and I can't wait to read more by him."
1,Lack of Shippment of this Uncomfortable bag,We ordered this bag 3 weeks ago. And as yet still have not recieved it. Today I am looking at the reviews and it's probably better that we don't get it. It does not make sense that someone would sell something that is so uncomfortable. The guys that are wearing these work very hard and should not have yet one more thing that is going to give them pain. This makes no sense.
5,Very Nice low heel shoe.,I have worn these shoes for a while now and I love them because of the low heel and still a classy look for work. I always order them online. They arrive quickly so it saves shopping around town for my size an color. They are true to size and I can wear them all day at work without any complaints.
2,"Cute style, but not as advertised.","This is a very cute shoe, especially the style and the height of the heel. However, it is not made of leather as advertised. This makes a difference to shoppers as myself, as shoes made of manmade materials don't breathe well.Also, I ordered a Medium-width shoe, but this style runs extremely narrow. I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes. However, these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It's too bad, because the seller mailed the product to me in record time. Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item. Overall, I would not give the seller a negative rating, but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up (esp. in width)."
4,Very sweet,"This is a very sweet book, with simple illustrations and short, easy rhymes. (For example, ""books to read"" ""stringing beads."") It's a great book for the end of the day because it's got a nice, quiet feel to it. Although they're virtually identical, I prefer Cat's Play, perhaps because we own a cat and my baby is crazy for him."
1,BUY THE VHS INSTEAD!!!! DEFECTIVE PRODUCT!!!!!,"I used to own this on VHS, and loved it. When I saw it was available on DVD I snagged it.The sound drops out two or three times, on several tracks, which is infuriating enough. But my copy goes back to the main menu after each song!!! There are also several little glitches in the video.I just got this today, and have only spent ten frustrating minutes with this disc. They were bad enough to prompt me to write this review.Now, the show itself is classic puppy, and the songs are great. Ogre's performance is just plain scary. This would be the perfect video to play at your next church function or children's birthday party.But just take into consideration. Nettwerk is ripping you off, and the band off with this inferior and quite defective disc."
2,"Catalog Title, Catalog Treatment","This is a great title, but it's marred once again by ""catalog title"" treatment. You know the type: Mastering booth puts in an original tape master into the machine, goes to get some coffee, and returns when it's done. It's the same lackluster treatment that classic material gets all the time when someone doesn't see the value in what they're mastering outside of fleecing the faithful. Left channel dropouts, video errors... this title has 'em. Outside of some glaring issues, this title smokes and has never looked better. The video quality is great when it's not glitching. Buyer beware: this is a flawed title, but from the prior release it appears this is as good as it's going to get."
3,SKINNY PUPPY = THE BEST! NETTWERK = SAD JOB!,"First of all, the only reason this did not get 5 stars is NOT because of the band (Skinny Puppy, the godfathers of EBM INDUSTRIAL) but is because of the utter LACK by the label NETTWERK that did NOTHING but put the VHS version on DVD without ANY MENUS, GRAPHICS, NOTHING EXTRA!if you have the VHS tape, there is NO NEED to buy the DVD!if you don't have the VHS, this is a good buy, which is why I give it 3 stars. Peak era Skinny Puppy in one of the best live shows I have ever seen (except Alien Sex Fiend was pretty darn godly!) and is an instant classic of performance art & harsh electronics!"
3,Grip and arm cuff - great,"The fist grip and arm cuff are a great idea. They completely change the torque and muscles used while using this tool. Unfortunately this tool is used in a pushing motion, which is inherently flawed. You cannot use the large muscles of your legs, buttocks and torso whith a tool that is pushed. There are just better tools to do the job that will not wear our your arms and shoulders. At most I would use this tool for 3 - 5 minutes and then alternate with a tool that is pulled toward you (scuffle hoe, am forged handy weeder, circle hoe.) Trust me, even with a tool that is pulled using your legs, your arms and shoulders will get plenty of exercise.Best to use the arm cuff and handle on a tool that is pulled toward you."
5,Absolutely Heartbreaking,"I had seen this a while back and was never able to get it out of my mind. As we watch this impoverished senior go through his trials with little money and only the companionship of his dog Flike, it is just heartbreaking and sometimes difficult to watch. A black-and-white portrait of post-war Italy is incredibly well done by Director Vittorio De Sica, apparently with few professional actors. I was sad to see that this film was so reviled in Italy (the politicians apparently thought it would damage Italy's image). Fortunately, the US was the one country which found an audience for this film and it received a well-deserved Oscar Nomination for writing. It's difficult to say that I ""loved"" this film; but it is definitely one of the best of the 50s...it never fails to bring tears to my eye. A great and powerful film!"
4,"""Got The Nuts""",Dude - thanks for the awesome buckle. Everyone at my game loves it - and so do I. Thanks again.
1,Beware of Amazon pricing!,"I added this item to my shopping cart for $13.49. It is also sold from the seller for $13.49. But now that I am ready to checkout, I get a message saying ""We're sorry. The item ""I Can Do It Reward Chart"" is no longer available"" and the price from the same seller at Amazon is now $31.95! This is within a day's time."
5,Tony truly shines!,"I've been a Tony Harnell's since the TNT's early days, but have been disappointed with the latest TNT releases. Tony has found a new match where he truly shines. The song writing is great, and together, the band is awesome."
4,What a great flip!,"Back in 1967 when I bought the 45 single ""C'mon Marianne"" I was also blown away by the flip-side ""Let's Ride Again."" I'm more than happy that it finally appears on a CD compiliation! I'd be happy to buy this just for that song!Oh, by the way, the opening bars of C'mon Marianne,with just the full-throated voices of the 4 guys,was just as 'hair-raising' as the opening bars of the Beatles ""Paperback Writer"" with just the fab 4 vocals (also in an echo chamber!) GREAT STUFF !!"
2,i dont recomend with 500 watt amp or more,this sub is suposed to be able to withstand up to 1200 watts so i plugged it into a 500 watt amp and a week later the sub blew. thats not suppose to happen. i recomend these subs if your not going to hook them up to a amp thats 500 watts or more.
4,PYLE IS GREAT!!!!,"It's A GREAT subwoofer but if u dont have an amp that pushes the Power it wont sound as good. I had a 600 watt amp and the Speaker was really loud, hit hard! When i brought and amp that pushed 2400 Watts and plugged it in now i heard the difference this speaker is so good I now have 2. You can hear my car from 2 Blocks away!Pyle PL1290BL 12-Inch 1200 Watt DVC Subwoofer"
3,Too pricey for its effectiveness,"It's clearly better than the $3 shiny ones and does block out light...but seemingly does not block out UV well. Of course, without measuring, I cannot be certain. I just haven't noticed a heat reduction compared to my previous $15 one. Also, if you're not careful how you grab this with your fingers, you'll find yourself scrunching, crackling, crimping, whatever...the shade."
1,You'll either love or hate it.,"The whole film centers around Frankie (Ione Skye), who's a hopeless romantic living in her own little dream world - the 1940's or '50's - while the rest of the world goes on in the new millennium . She likes to quote famous people who once said something deep or wise to prove she's like them somehow. She has a sleeping problem, which actually has little to do with the movie other than symbolism (suggesting that's she's different because she doesn't dream due to chronic insomnia). She's looking for the love of her life, but almost nobody measures up to her unusual standards. Until one day...If you find Frankie to be cute and endearing, you'll want her to be happy by finding true love with somebody that will put up with her quirkiness. If you find her to be boring or annoying, you'll simply want her to go away. Guess my choice?"
1,What a stinker!,"A previous reviewer summed it up EXACTLY:""This movie seems to want to be very artsy and intellectual, but really isn't. Ione Skye's (Frankie)character is frankly unlikeable, she is a self involved bore who seems to be living on another planet ...""The only thing more boring than her are her loser friends. I fell asleep."
1,Awful,This movie is such a complete waste of time. Don't be fooled by all of the fake reviews on this website. This movie is awful.
5,Wow.,"I picked this movie up by chance one night while looking for some ""hidden treasure"" among the aisles at my local video store. I found it in Dream for an Insomniac. Although I am the eternal optimist, I found myself able to relate to Frankie and crew even through the sometimes cheezy dialoug. (Hey it happens in real life too!) I found myself repeating lines as I went about work the next day, ""Anything less than mad passionate extraordinary is a waste of time."" I have tuned some of my friends into believers as well. Not everyone will appreciate the romance and the humor, no. But not everyone understands Shakespeare either! If you are one of the few who fell in love with someone who ""when they are not with you, you wish that they were in your arms..."" then I reccommend you watching DFI. You make not fall head over heels, like I did. But some parts of you will be touched."
1,Badly written romantic comedy,"Really, the only thing going for this movie are all the nice quotes interspersed throughout the movie.In any romantic comedy, the maxim is that the romantic leads must have appeal in some way to the viewer. Ione Sky's character does not. While she's supposed to be a literate, depressive, yet idealistic romantic, she comes off simply as a self-absorbed, self-centered drama queen. Moreover, the backstory involving the reason for her isnomnia is completely unconvincing as none of it is reflected in her character.I simply found the romance ludicrious and rather disturbing in its conclusion. You do not want to see these two get together. The other characters are rote Gen-X cliches and the use of black and white in the beginning of the movie unfortunatedly highlights the all-around weak acting."
3,Pretty! But the barcode label ruined some of the functionality.,"I liked the Blk/Pink design... and still do. But the tumbler had this horrible, horrible sticky BARCODE LABEL on the bottom, which stuck sooo tightly to the black non-slip foam padding that I ended up peeling the whole padding off. Otherwise it would've left a very sticky residue on the bottom of the cup. I didn't care for the non-skid padding anyway. But now there's a small hole on the bottom (previously covered by the foam padding) that lets moisture into the double wall space. I still use it but it's always ""foggy"" between the insulated walls."
5,Go for it!,"Perfect item, just as promised! If you feel a bit concerned about buying your car parts from here..do not be, you will get precisely what you are looking for!"
5,Great Dan Zanes...,"Another great Dan Zanes CD that can be enjoyed by the entire family. The use of many instruments, different vocals, history, and talent all mix up to make a fun, eclectic treat for all."
4,Lester is great.,"Lester is great fun for kids and animals alike. I find the toy's sound to be fairly realistic, and the toy is very durable."
3,so so,"I found three things about it that I dislike. You may not be bothered by them.1. It is three hours long from many scenes that would be better if they were shorter. They ""over egged the pudding"" to use a British saying.2. Great liberty is taken with changing many things in the plot to make it different from the original book.3. The cast of famous, but typecast, actors is distracting. When Christopher Lee appears I expect some supernatural occurrence. When Patrick Mcnee appears I expect Mrs. Peel to not be far behind."
5,Wonderful family movie,I think this is a perfect movie to watch when you have several hours to spend relaxing. It's very long but you don't have to watch it all in one sitting. You'll want to get back to it as soon as possible though because it keeps you wanting more!I divided it up into two evenings. This is one movie you can watch with your grandmother or with children around and not be embarrassed. I think it's a great family movie. And the picture was fine. I used to have the VHS copy and this DVD was much better quality.
5,Excellent copy!,I had read online that there weren't any decent copies of this movie but this one is an excellent example. Picture and sound quality are great. Some people may complain that the movie logo pops up after every section (like it does on TV when it goes to commercial) but that didn't bother me. Very good copy regardless.
5,Classic,"This video series is a classic version of Jules Verne's story. Years ago we had taped the TV mini-series onto VHS, but over the years the tapes have worn down. We were excited to see that it has been dubbed onto DVD. Although the cover does not look like it is the version with Pierce Brosnan, it is the correct version. You will not be disappointed with this classic."
5,"Now you've got it, now you don't.","It's like a roller-coaster. A wild ride, a slower pace where you get to know the characters, a quick turn in the plot and another wild ride. I wanted to know how it ended but I didn't want it to end."
4,Not bad,"It was a good diversion. I've been to that region, and I enjoyed reading a story about its past. Thanks"
4,Worth the buy.,"While Klayton wanders between melancholy complain-scapes and bowel-shaking rockers, the three or four rockers on each of his song-oriented albums (Celldweller and Wish Upon A Blackstar) are worth the purchase prices of the whole things, even if you don't go for the lighter stuff. On this record, Switchback and Last Firstborn alone are worth the seven bucks. Crank 'em up and take whatever else you like as a bonus."
1,disappointed,I order this product to reduce the pain from the laser and I follow the instructure but I was really disappointed and it hurt so much and it did not work at all . I am not recommended this just horrible thing
2,Frightening,"It's hard to imagine that a vocalist with a voice as bad as Tom Waits can make a career selling records. Thankfully (mercifully) many of the cuts have long long instrumental introductions such as 'Dave The Butcher'. The opening cut, 'Underground', will be enough to frighten most listeners away to begin with. To call this 'music' cutting edge progressive alternative experimental is like dropping a can of paint on the sidewalk and calling it modern art. The 'music' (noise) on this disk is different. But that doesn't make it music. I generously gave it 2 stars for the high pain threshold of the backup band."
2,Alan Parsons without Alan Parsons,"This is the third album without Woolfson (discounting Freudiana), and the first, musically, largely without Alan Parsons as well. Time Machine is not a typical AP album, and Alan Parsons' absence in composing music is evident. Being an Alan Parsons Project fan, I was disappointed with Woolfson's departure as his contribution was instrumental to that APP sound; with Time Machine Alan Parsons apparently has taken the cue by composing only a minute piece, allowing the vacuum to be filled by fellow AP band members. Competent music? Yeah. Polished production values? Sure. The Alan Parsons Project it ian't."
2,Mr. Parsons Is Trying Too Hard!,"I've purchased Alan Parsons from the time I heard ""I Robot"" and had to go back and buy Tales of Mystery. Always a progressive sound, always something different you hear each time you listen. This latest album has 2 worthwhile songs on it I think: ""Out of the Blue"" and ""Press Rewind"". The album starts out great, with all the mystery and lavish arrangement that has made Alan Parsons one of all-time favorites over the years, then even this turns into disco-drivel, with a beat that has absolutely no place in the song! Then it's on to a song that is a backdrop for some monologue (ala Pink Ployd), which itself doesn't make much sense. ""Out of the Blue"" is the third song and is great, but then it's FF to ""Press Rewind"", then on to another AP CD. In my opinion the greatest album he made was 1993's ""Try Anything Once"", where every song is good. I don't expect to hear ""filler"" from AP, and if Eric Woolfson is to blame, he'd better come home!"
3,Hardly a concept album - time doesn't really feature,"This was a disappointment after On Air (about my favourite AP album). It is such a promising topic to cover, and the treatment of the subject of flight was done so well in On Air. I expected something much better, especially considering how brilliantly the early 80's ELO album ""Time"" did to create an escapist atmosphere full of time travel into the future and all the emotions of someone unable to get back. This just seemed like a collection of unrelated ditties in comparison, but I'm prepared to forgive AP considering at least half his albums are brilliant. He just sets a high standard for himself."
4,Review by SD,"I've just heart the new song The Time Machine. This is completely new for me. I think it's a new experience for me. I didn't heart the other songs on the album yet, but i'm looking forward to it. I've also got a question. Do you know that the time machine is released on single? I'd like to know. If you've got the answer, please send me an email: silverfish@hi.nl. I'm only 15 years old. I've already heart something more from the alan parsons project but i didn't knew this song. If you have commons on this review i'd like to hear it."
2,not one of his best...,"ever since Alan Parsons parted with Eric Woolfson, the chemistry has gone. I enjoyed the earlier work & really liked the Definitive Collection.. Sorry, but this is not that good..."
2,Stick to Rumpole,"Mortimer writes Rumpole, who is a delight. This is the third (I think) in Mortimer's memoirs, and I missed its predecessors so this review may do Mr. Mortimer a disservice. There is a big of bragging, some interesting notes, but it a fairly forgettable series of life lessons, barely disguised as things of leave behind one that do not fit in a Will. It is a sad truth that there are a number of writers whose characters are more interesting, and charming, than their authors."
5,Monster RCA Adapter,I bought this to connect my stereo receiver to my subwoofer for my home theater system. My subwoofer has two inputs for sound and my receiver has one output for the subwoofer. I read on several websites that you need to get an adapter like this so that sound is transmitted to both terminals on your subwoofer. These cables seems sturdy and well built.
5,ANTHRAX WRAPS IT UP,"I was simply floored at the cover of SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH... it alone in my opinion is worth the purchase of this disc. The comical LiVE version of ""I'm the man"" is also done well. I think this album is definitely worth its weight in METAL.."
3,they the man,"""I'm The Man"" is a funny song but only if you start with the third version and don't listen to the other two also. The Sabbath cover is damn good!"
3,Not the best counting book for young toddlers,"We've had this book for several months now, and while my son is now thirteen mos old, the objects being counted are too small for him to really follow (leaves, pencils, shoebuckles, slide steps, fleas). I got this book because my son loves Maisy, and of course he enjoys reading this book because of the bright colors and familiar characters, but I think there are better counting books out there for young toddlers."
5,"Wow, It is working even while over 200ft apart!","I am currently using this to broadcast a CCTV DVR signal from my barn to inside my house well over 200ft away. Granted this is setup line of site and going through two windows(one on the barn, one on the house) but it works better then I expected.It will flicker every few minutes, and if I stand directly in front of the reciver the signal will go out.Overal I'm happy and this is exactly the purchase I needed to monitor my barns CCTV system while in the house."
2,Concept is awesome...,I love the concept of this product and it worked reasonably well. I had two problems. First the unit intermittently would power off in the middle of a movie and I had to keep running to the transmitter to power cycle the unit. Second the IR remote extender didn't work well at all. I ended up returning the unit. :(
2,Didn't perform as i had hoped,The transmitter couldn't send a clear signal 70 feet to the receiver. It was line of sight without any objects in the way. I could play with the ears and get a fair signal but if I walked in front of the transmitter the signal would go away and have a hard time connecting again.
2,Works but the sound quality is poor,"I bought this set to replace the cable I ran from the computer to the A/V receiver. The unit mostly works, though unless I had the two in each others open line of sight, there was interference when someone walked around the room. What killed it for me was the poor quality of sound. The manufacturer claims hi-fi sound, but it is anything but. Placing the units right in front of each other did not help. It was just painful to listen to I did not bother with the video as even the sound was unacceptable. It may be ok for just watching tv on an old 32"" TV or a low end sound system, but that's about it. I returned the unit and ate shipping both ways. Otherwise the thing would just gather dust."
4,Working well so far!,"I got this to replace another wireless a/v sender that I had purchased on sale from a different store. The other one never actually worked without interference, fuzz, and buzzing (annoying!). This Nyrius model was super easy to set up, and worked right out of the box. The picture is clear, and the sound is good. No interference whatsoever! I'm so glad to have cable in my bedroom now. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the remote extender seems to work on a bit of a delay, and sometimes it doesn't seem to work at all. I'm sure there's probably a solution for this, which I'm going to start looking into. All in all, this is a great deal -- much better then hiring a contractor to install 50 ft of cable through my baseboards!"
2,ho hum,with direct line of site over about 30 feet the picture and sound were still noticabley staticy and garbled. walk in front of antenna and blips completely for 2-3 seconds.
5,It Just Works,"EZ set-up, Worked right out of the box. Picture quality was better than I expected on the 27"" display that I connected to it and the IR repeater lets you control the cable box in the other room."
4,Basic,Cannot get video to work yet. Audio quality suffers when people walk between line-of-sight transmission.
2,Margo is Disappointed,"Nyrius NY-GS3200 5.8GHz 6 Channel Wireless Audio/Video Sender Transmitter & Receiver System with IR Remote Extender is very disappointing!It does send the video signal clearly...but is ultra sensitive to movement and 'stuff'. The audio is bad....and the remote control is useless.... so my high hopes became disappointment. Possibly, my home has too many impedance factors? Oh well....I believe you will probably be disappointed unless you have a dwelling that is skimpy on furniture and other electronic items."
4,Be Careful With Cordless phones,the product works well for my audio system as long as my cordless phones are off. I have a three phone system and they cause a constant click when they communicate with each other. this is my only gripe.
4,Nyrius GS3200 quit after only a month,"I had high hopes for the Nyrius GS3200 wireless sender/receiver as its sound and picture quality provided was great. However, it only worked for a month or so and then quit working..."
5,Great Device!,"I just got this unit to replace the 2.4GHz Leapfrog unit I used for the past four years. I am sending my Cable TV signal from my TV room to my small LCD kitchen TV, located about 18 feet away, but with two brick walls, a wooden cabinet and a refrigerator on the way. The 2.4 GHz unit worked relatively well, but there was always some degree of interference and when turning on the microwave oven, interference was really bad. So I decided for the 5.8 GHz unit. Well, couldn't make a better choice! The signal in channel 1 is just great, with no interference at all even from my 5.8 GHz wireless telephones. The remote control also works great through the remote extender. Also, my purchasing experience at Amazon met all my expectations (right product, right price, on time delivery). I highly recommend this product!"
2,transmitter receiver review,"Product arrived on time, in good condition. Product does not work as stated, when transmitting signal from pvr to television which is 5 feet away there is a very notable fliker on the television that is anoying and will not go away. This cannot be used to transmit signals for tv."
3,2 GREAT MATCHES ONE OF THEM MEMORABLE.,The undercard was lameish at best but the taker vs goldust match was very good. Hbk vs mankind was AWESOME A TOTAL CLASSIC the best match of Mick foleys career and it was just another day at the office for hbk. This tape is one of the top 3 rarest VHS wrestling videos ever released and could be the rarest so if your a collector it's a must have.
3,Doesn't fit on strollers,My daughter loves the toy however the velcro peice that attachs to the stroller is not long enough if the tray is on and too big if the tray is off. We eneded up having to sew an extra peice of velcro on to make it fit.
3,"Overpriced, hard to pull","I was in a bit of a hurry to get some cable locally and picked up a spool of this despite it's expense. It's not even oxygen free. Anyway, the clear casing may be kinda cool to look at, but it's difficult to work with, both in cutting, and when pulling. As far as audio quality, I can't tell any difference between this and the ""lamp cord"" I had been using before. Next time I'll go with some solid core stuff."
3,Item is not as advertised -- more like 80 feet,"This is excellent quality speaker cable. I have no complaints whatsoever about the quality of the wire.Unfortunately, the item is still not as advertised. The spool I received contained exactly 81 feet of wire (measured with a tape measure while the wire was laid out in 20-foot strips).There's a label on the spool put in place by the manufacturer (Monster Cable). That label lists general product information, certifications, and marketing nonsense. Someone has put a black sticker on top of that label to cover the area where it says ""100 feet."" With the black sticker in place, my spool reads ""XP-CI BIG-[black sticker]."" Under the black sticker, it says ""100 feet (30.5meter)"". A bit shady."
1,Advertised as 100 feet in reality is 80 feet,"Buyer beware with this seller... To be fair, the speaker wire is a good quality but mine arrived as 80 feet of cable on a 100 foot spool. I measured this myself and came up 20 feet short. So if you are expecting or needing 100 feet, you wont get it with this product."
5,Another great one,"This is an amazing cd that captures the magic of the live performances of Linda Tillery and the Cultural Heritage Choir. If you like spirited, heartfelt, get up and get dancing kind of music buy this one. It starts with an incredible rendition of Lift Every Voice and Sing that combines African drumming wit ha gospel choir sound. It continues on with an amazing jam in tribute to James Brown. There are wonderful guest performances by Wilson Pickett, Laura Love, Eric Bibb, Kelly Joe Phelps, Odetta and more. Linda Tillery is one of our true musical treasures."
1,"Amazon ""hurry two left in stock"".???????? Where?","There are none in stock, and if you have ordered delivery isa gamble. My advice, if you have (as I did) an emergency, try a different product.Strictly speaking I have awarded 1 star for non delivery, so I have no comments on the product."
1,top lock is broken after light use,"After about 2 years of light DIY homeowners use the top lock broke. Piece stuck inside preventing the tape to roll. I would not recommend, because the only way to repair it is to buy a new one. I hardly used it at all."
5,Excellent Book! Feel like reading a tech novel.,"This is definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It covers basic as well as some advanced topics. It would even suffice for quick reference, if you are looking for specific topic. But I would recommend reading this book from page one to the end if you're really looking to hone your C++ skills. It helped me brushing up my skills while working on a large-scale C++ project. Enjoy!"
2,not for beginners,"This book is largely incomprehensible to the beginning student of C++. It is more suited as an esoteric colloquy among experienced programmers. All of my classmates agree that the choice of this book for our C++ study was inappropriate, confusing and demoralizing. The choice of this book as our text did spur a fruitful search by everyone for other, less presumptuous, presentations."
2,"I don't like it, wish I hadn't wasted money on it",I bought this for my son's carseat because he wasn't interested in the baby einstein toybar he had and this one looked so cute. The problem isn't that he doesn't like it (he does) the problem is it doesn't fit on his Graco infant carrier. Unless you have a Fisher Price carseat then this product is not for you.
4,Great for a lap toy,"My 4 month old loves this toy, but we also had a hard time attaching it to my graco car seat. I just put it on her lap and she loved to chew on the rings. Good toy overall."
5,GUN'S FAVORITE TOY,"I registered for this toy because we did our son's room in fish and thought it was adorable. I NEVER knew that it was to be used on a car seat, I missed that somewhere. It is definatley worth the money!! He is almost 6 months old and it has been his favorite toy since he was three months. It is so easy for him to hold on to, and chew on. He keeps a tight grip on it when we carry him around. When he was in the infant seat we just handed it to him and he went to town. Out of all our small toys this one is THE BEST and his favorite. I would highly recomend for anyone. If you can't fit it on the carseat, hold on to and wait until your child is ready to grab something and keep it with them. Definatley entertaining, and not a waste of money at all!!!!"
3,Doesn't fit Carseat,This toy by fisher price is just adorable unfortunately I returned it to the store because I bought it for the car seat and on the back of the package it shows a fisher price car seat which is no longer made and I have a feeling that the handle on those car seats are alot smaller so the toy would fit on an older car seat not ones currently on the market especially graco brand which is what we have for our baby. I gave it 3 stars just because it is cute and if you manage to find somewhere to hook it then you can actually use the toy. Maybe once my baby arrives I'll buy it again if she shows interest in it but since I couldn't use it on the carseat or our crib I opted to return it for now. I love fisher price items but they should have test marketed on other brands because alot of people are unhappy with this item.
3,Good idea bad design,We bought this for our 3 month old son. Thought it was a great idea and heard good things about the link-a-doos. Well the spiral design is hard to get to fit on our car seat and when we put it on there it didn't fit like we thought and made it hard to carry the car seat. So needless to say we took it off and now it's a tummy time toy. The design definately needs to be fixed. He does love to play with it on his tummy!
1,Bad Experience,"I purchased one of these pricey tolieting aids. I have not owned it very long, less than 6 months and it has a large crack in the curve or neck of it. For the price the plastic neck design is weak and too much pressure and it will crack! I was very unhappy with mine. I am looking now for another brand. Maybe mine was defective."
2,Read and Speak Arabic for Beginners,"This book is okay for someone who wants to learn Arabic as the formal language as in books, Quraan, writings, and news, not the everyday spoken language. This book is not for you, if you want to learn a particular dialect from a particular country."
2,Nice graphic but not a good game,Only word I can say is this game has the nice graphic but the rolling screen hurting my eyes. pretty hard to win the game..I don't have any fun playing this game.
5,I don't know what all the fuss is?,"Every one of the critics reviewed this game as OK, and I don't see why. I like it a lot! I'm a big fan of games like Commandos, Warcraft, Roller Coaster Tycoon, etc. And I definitely think Sudden Strike fits with those. You really have to think about strategy when attacking enemies. You can't just send all your men and steam roll 'em! You have to use some flanking tactics and sneaking up to win. And RECON, RECON, RECON! Also, taking the time to train your men really pays off. The only thing I found odd was that a tank couldn't run over a soldier. They have to shoot them to kill them. Also, I would like to be able to zoom in to see my troops and tanks better. Other than that, I think anyone who likes an addictive ""high-clicking"" game will love this. But beware, it is a ""Time Sucker!"""
3,This will only fit the Sony Alpha 100,"Although it doesn't clearly say so, this Camera Armor was designed for the Alpha 100. I have a Sony Alpha 350, so I hoped that it would fit close enough. Not so. The buttons on the right side of the screen are in the wrong location, the LCD Screen protector does not fit at all, and the armor does not allow for the LCD screen to rotate. Be careful. It appears that it would work well to protect the Alpha's plastic parts with some reduction in access to the buttons, but I'm returning it tomorrow."
3,Not for Sony A300.,"This item, although not specifically mentioned, does NOT work for the Sony A300 camera. This item was returned. Will consider one when they make it for the a300 camera."
1,Don't buy thi if you want grief!,"This cover is made of poor quality. The rubber ripped while I carefully placed it over the camera, especially around the viewfinder and the back area (near the LCD screen). Save your money, a plastic bag would be better than this cover."
4,Adorabe 1st laptop,"My 8 month old son is obsessed with my laptop so we got him his own for Christmas, lol. Its very cute and he loves that it lights up but he also loves to shut it closed constantly. I wouldn't let him play with this one alone because I can easily see this hurting his little fingers. But i do like it and so does my son."
5,Make a combo to make it more fun. read more,"This is an amazing series for a kiddo who loves word world. we have all dvds andit took us time to collect them, this is great opportunity to save time and money.The best way to encourage a child to learn is to buy the words world animals justlike the ones in dvd. I highly recommend the famous Word World pull apart plush plush soft animals to go with it.The babies and kids love them so much. You can't get them anymore at storesbut if you are lucky you can come across the set on e bay.It is worth all the money as it helps a child to learn so fast so early so much.It is also amazing how much they sell for even used ones so it is good investment.Well worth the price."
4,Cute toy,"I took it out of the box and discovered the batteries were dead. After I replaced them, it worked fine. I'm glad I checked as there is nothing worse on Christmas morning than dead batteries for your grandchild."
4,6m-24m/2yrs,"This is a neat little first laptop. We bought this for my son when he was in the hospital for something to do. He liked it because of the colors, buttons, different options (music, counting, etc) and how everything lit up. He loved the mouse and would just go back and forth with it. He also liked that it has the handle like a lunchbox and could just pick up and go.My son is tough on toys (hes a boy), and I have never had an issue (even with applejuice spills into the speakers). Its light and easy for them to open, all buttons are meant for little ones hands and the mouse is an actual mouse! We had ours for 3yrs and are finally yard sale'in it. for the age range...I dont think a 3yr old would use this for more than about 10min. they like the lights, noise, music, etc...but its a baby/young toddler toy at most. I would say by age 2 if they are normal development they would be bored with this toy."
2,too simple for over 14 months,this became very boring for our 12 month old. it also became a not much used toy for our friends baby as well.2 out of 2 kids makes me think it is for 6 months to 12months. I gave mine away to charity for children
2,Frustrating for Baby and Mom,"My son likes this toy a lot. He is always trying to play with mom and dad's laptop so we thought this would be perfect. However, he likes to shut it and once he does he cant open it. Whoever designed this obviously doesn't have any kids because it's too hard to open! So he he ends up screaming and crying and I'm constnatly having to stop what I'm doing and open the stupid laptop again, just for him to shut it a few seconds later. I hate this toy!!"
4,"Nice toy, good for gift giving!","This toy is well mad, not shabby, takes a ton of abuse from our enthusiastic grandson. We have a hard time keeping him away from our computers (babysplat is a godsend) and this toy keeps him happy in the car or crib. It will not get him out of a cranky mood if he's in one, but that's just the nature of a noise-making toy. If you're looking for a gift, perhaps for a new parent or a 1-year old, this is a good choice. It's small, sturdy and really a cute idea."
2,This cd doesn't even compare to being at Twilo,"Well..I expected a lot more out of this cd then what i got. If you want to compare this cd as actually being at twilo and hearing junior spin...DON'T. I expected a little more of a twilo experience to be on this cd. If you're looking for a cd with all vocals and weak beats..then this is your choice. But if your looking for deep house and trance.. look elsewhere. The first two song on the first cd make it seem that this is a good cd, but unofortunately, it goes all downhill from there. And the second cd.....ugh. Don't get me wrong, i love junior, but he could have done a lot better."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"Dave Barry is one of the funniest writers ever. I bought a few of his books for my mom, and she loved them. I skimmed a few of them, and nearly every page makes my cry from laughing so hard. He writes about everyday life, so is very understandable and extremely relatable. If you like comedy, he is not an author to pass up."
3,"Not his greatest, but","still has some funny parts. My main gripe with this one is that much of the material is truly dated. The book was written in the late '80s, so that's understandable. I don't regret buying it or reading it, but I don't think it's worth paying full price for. Dave Barry is hilarious and I love everything I've read by him so far."
5,Great biography,"Joseph McBride manages to create a rich, full biography of a reclusive character. Its details are many; its writing is rich; its insights are full. It's a wonderful book that told me much about Steven Spielberg."
1,Steven Spielberg is a Horrible Racist,Just watch that racist Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom to see that this man is deathly afraid of India and Indians in general. Too bad - he seems to love the Communist Chinese a lot though.
4,Much easier than MS,"I am an experienced c++ programmer but was a little rusty after several years away from c++. So first I tried MS Studio. I found it so frusterating to get started I gave up. The next day I tried again and gave up again. Third day same thing. So then I ordered Builder. I was up and productive in about a half hour. What a difference. Admitedly I had Delphi experience which helped but still it seems clear to me that the environment is much easier, simpler and faster. There are some negative reviews - maybe those problems show up later but not so far for me."
4,review the reviews with no pictures? Is it dos?,"I am surprised at the reviews not showing a picture of a program. Don't you want to bragg about a pretty program? I want to know-ish it is windows, like xp. I make a lot of purely home programs anyway, so all I need to know is, is it window-ish or dos-ish. I'll be back.Thanks-ish. Roggie."
3,Zorro Mask,"I purchased the mask for my husband to wear to a masquerade ball we attended. The mask worked well. It took a little while to get it tied just right, but he was able to wear it comfortably for the entire event."
4,great,"This was great for my 13 yr old son's ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" costume for a masquerade ball. The top part of the bandanna could stand to be a big longer, but over all it looked great!"
1,Carr Crash,I expected Alienist II but got Plan Nine From Outer Space.... The premise was interesting but didn't go anywhere. Please stick to historical not hysterical
1,Impossible,"This is the ""Battlefield Earth"" of books. It simply is impossible that it was written by the author of The Alienest, one of the most engrossing pieces of historical fiction ever written. In this ""book"", the writing, the ""message"" and the premise are just absurd. Miss this book at all costs."
1,Carr hits brick wall--head-on,"Stopped at page 153 couldn't bare any more embarrasement for the author...read his first two books and thought I was on to another great writer...what a total disappointment, wouldnt send this crap to an enemy"
1,No pre-conceptions but still found it trite,"I have not read either of Carr's previous thrillers so I did not have any expectations about ""Killing Time"". However, I found this book to be unsatisfying on ever level. There was no real character development and certainly no understanding conveyed of the motivation for the actions that occurred. As someone else mentioned, I am not interested in the weapons, hardware, and psuedo-science. I found myself skimming and skipping throughout the book. Definitely not to my taste."
1,Why?,I enjoyed Carr's previous works so much that I ordered Killing Time prior to its release. What a waste of anticipation! Mr. Carr seems to have forgotten how to build a plot and create characters for whom the reader can feel any concern. Disappointing to say the least.
1,Who really wrote this book?,"Caleb Carr could not has written this terrible book. Unless, his previous books were written by someone else. Killing Time has my vote for ""The Worst Book Ever Read. """
1,Impressively awful,"This really is one of the worst written books I have ever seen in print, even if the definition of ""in print"" is extended to embrace self-published books about people communicating with aliens from the planet Venus. I wonder, was it submitted for the Bulwer-Lytton contest?No, seriously. I'm serious. You read this book, you really are killing time. Yours. I used it to help occupy my time on the throne. Propelled by morbid curiosity, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, but it was still interminable."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"I had read (and liked) THE ALIENIST, and I also enjoy near-future sci-fi, so I was looking forward to reading this book. However, there wasn't much to it. Most of the first two-thirds of the book are spent explaining the history of the world over the next thirty years, and not as seamlessly as one would hope. At one point I had to ask myself what the heck was happening, because it had seemed so long since anything actually HAD happened. While the message the book it trying to convey is important, the message gets lost amid the confusing story, bland characters, and questionable science.For a similar style of book, but much better written, check out NATURE'S END, by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka, if you can find it. (it's out of print)"
1,Horrible,"Just a terrible novel. I got about halfway through and just gave up. Poor writing style. I see it has a two star rating, pretty low and I don't see how it managed to get the second star."
1,Do we have to beg?,"Caleb, PLEASE, PLEASE make this go away ! Its a bad dream, I didn't read it, its not true ! Its impossible that you wrote this. Please write another book about 19th century NY, bring back those characters, help me erase this book from my brain. I tried re-reading your other books, but it only mitigated the pain. Please help us, we are all suffering from this book !"
1,not worth the paper it's written on,Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library and did not buy it. I share other reviewers dissapointments as I enjoyed Carr's other books - but don't even bother with this one.
1,A Disappointment,"I was so incredibly excited to find out that Mr. Carr had a new book. I absolutely loved and highly recommend his previous fictional efforts. The mix of fiction and history is perfect. What a major disappointment to discover that his latest effort is neither. I felt that the characters were unbelievable and unlikable and the dialogue very ""cheesy."" Not quite sci-fi and not quite thriller. Please Caleb, I'll forgive you this time, but return to what you know best."
5,Great Sampler,"If you're not sure about a artist, this is the best way to have a listen. This CD has some really good music by some of today's best musicians. This is a smooth buy."
1,Believe me: You don't need this!,"All information you need is already there, in MSDN. It's not worth to have all those pages printed. I have bought this reference thinking it was different from current documentation attached to Visual C++, but it is the SAME.This is fairly useless, unless you want to loose time and money."
5,Best compressor,"This is an awesome product. It produces a really clean sound, giving you that greaty 'plucky' quality. Turning up the sustain between 12:00 and 3:00 is the sweet spot for this pedal. The sustain is so natural. Finally, I like combining it with an overdrive pedal. Set your gain to low or medium (I prefer the Zen pedal, but also use the Ibanez T9 mod plus), and the Keeley compressor transforms that into a truly warm quality that is great for blues/rock, maintaining a nice crisp edge. The Keeley compressor is a bit more expensive than other compressors, but from what I've heard and going by the experiences of my friends, it is well worth the difference."
5,A REAL Treasure...highly recommended,"This is an absolutely wonderful compilation of 365 inspired readings: one for every day. Christians especially will be blest in their devotional times by reading this book mornings or evenings as time is found to meditate on these offerings from many sources of wisdom and truth.You would be hard pressed to find a better book of devotional readings at such a reasonable price. Kudos to both the author/compiler and the publisher who has kept this book at a low and very reasonable price.If you love devotional books that truly feed the soul: this one is for you. enjoy and be daily blest with this true treasury of wisdom.Pastor Len Hummel, Clearlight Ministries"
5,good bad not evil,"The Cramps are great as was my whole experience with amazon. Quick delivery,fair price,good condition of product.Bad Person"
2,Muddy...muddy..,"I can't believe Taragon has issued a package like this with such inferior sounding mixes!!!I am taking ""More Today Than Yesterday"", because in all reality, why else pick up a package of The Spiral Staircase?? It sounds god-awful. I don't think I need say anymore.If you want a (somewhat) better sounding rendition, it's on Rhino's ""Have A Nice Day"" volume one. By the way, good luck finding it!!"
4,pure emotion,"This soundtrack is one of my favorites. The music can be both dark and powerful or sad and delicate. The use of so many different instruments ads to the mysterious combination that can take one back to the times of the haunting beast in the French forests. Track 3 was touching and beautiful.There can be heard many eastern influences on the cd, where we can hear the raw power of the battle between good and evil. As a soundtrack collector i deeply recommentd it. Its a very mysterious and haunting cd."
2,Routine Scott Western,"In Santa Fe, Scott plays an ex-Confederate soldier who ends up working for the expanding Santa Fe railroad. His brothers, who also served with him in the War, are still angry at the Union, and develop their own band of outlaws who are determine to make the Union pay for the suffering of the South. Scott is caught between his own flesh and blood and his desire to help build the railroad as it stretches through the Western wilderness.Scott is entertaining as always, and there's some decent action in Santa Fe, but this is only an okay film."
2,It's not the original.,"I was really disappointed. Picked this up, thinking it was the original Kimba. But, the original is available again, so check it out."
1,I wish I could return it!,I spent countless hours trying to get this to work! Never actually did much of anything. The software it comes with runs very slowly and crashes all the time. Not worth the money.
3,Classic book but not sure if this is a kosher edition,"Stratton's book is a classic and it is a great book to have for someone trying to learn the field. However, this is not a normal edition. The print quality is not very good - like it would be in a normal xerox of an old book. No copyright pages are given, there is no publisher information, so it seems like it is not an official edition. Some equations are circled and there are a few minor comments/markings scattered through the pages which indicates this is someone's book which has been used for mass scale production - somehow I did not realize this when I ordered the book. Had i known this I would have gotten an official copy as that would be the right thing to do."
2,"Nice jigsaw, I think","I didn't buy this through Amazon, and I regret it. I bought what I thought was the same thing from CPO Bosch. They list it as the same part number, but don't include the blades that are a part of the kit on Amazon and Bosch's websites."
5,excellent tool,"the bosch jig saw cut smoothly and perfectly as expected from a high quality tool , even though reconditioned"
3,Too much cash!!!!!!!,This toy stinks. I bought it for [amt]and i got it. But... after i opened it we had to pay more money to actually get the tadpoles. 1 for [amt] and 2 for [amt]. Its a big rip.
2,2008 Zooper Ska: Rough ride,"This is an attractive sturdy stroller (LOVE the UV shade!), unfortunately the rough ride on concrete and arduous opening and closing is a deal breaker for me. It now stays at grandmas.If you really are considering this stroller, I would say it works best for short walks or as an extra lightweight on hand (stores flat or stands upright) but I would not recommend it unless you can find a deal under $100."
3,Tripod work OK with a little time to set up properly,I like this design but it is a little on the light side. That is good for carryting but not so good for stability in high winds. Some of the Plastic parts seem cheaply made so I am not sure how durable they will be after much Sun exposure and normal use.These type of tripods tend to be way overpriced so overall it was a good buy for the price compared to others on the market.
3,"What is ""faith?""","What I didn't see in this book is how ""faith"" translated into relationship with God within each of the three religious paths. While there were discussions of how their religions made them feel good/comforted them, I didn't see how God transformed them into his image. It seemed to be more about creating God/Allah in images they could be comfortable with - ""I couldn't believe in a God who...would require particular rituals such as prayer/require belief in original sin, etc.What does it mean to believe? If God created us (rather than vice versa) then what does he require of us? How does God speak to us and guide us when we stray? Because if we don't stray (no such thing as original sin after all and God loves us all just the way we are and we don't need to bend our wills to his) why do we need God at all? In which case, any road truly will lead home after all."
2,Required text for class,the book is an Oprah Winfrey saga. From what I have read so far it is not historically accurate. Pretty much three women discussing their thoughts about their religious beliefs.
5,enlightening,Loved this book. The experience of the authors as described in this book answers many questions I have had and confirms many of my beliefs. This is timely and timeless. It could make a groundbreaking movie. Highly recommended.
4,Faith Club Bridges To Understanding,I found this book to be very interesting on many levels. Each woman explains the basics in their faith; they frankly cover the stereotypes they have with each other; they explore the range of their personal beliefs and doubts; and they arrive at strong faith based friendships - even if they don't share the same one. The world would be a better place if we all appreciated each other as human beings.
5,Rodda Award Nomination,"THE FAITH CLUB by Ranya Idliby, Suzanne Oliver & Priscilla Warner been nominated for the 2009 Rodda Award sponsored by the Church and Synagogue Library Association (CSLA), an international organization serving congregational libraries of all faiths.

To learn more about CSLA and the Rodda Award go to www.cslainfo.org."
4,The Faith Club,I read this book as a part of a church book club and then was so impressed with it I decided to buy three more copies to give to friends so they could also realize that many of our pre-conceived ideas about people of other races and religions are wrong and we need to become educated about how they really are. After reading the book many find that a lot of our religions are similar and often have the same root as the beginning.
5,the faith club,Everyone should read The Faith Club. The 3 women who started this club know how to educate us to overcome bias. Peace is possible when we all learn about each other and accept our differences.
3,"ok trimmer, not perfect","Pros: The battery life is nice, I've taken it with me travelling andit has never felt like the battery was running out of juice.Cons: It seems to take extraordinarily long to trim facial hair, if you've got thick hair. On just my chin alone, it seems to take 5 minutes of going back and forth, and it still seems to miss a few dozen hairs. The vacuum picks up about 90% of the hair, but really, what the difference between SOME of the hair on the counter, and ALL of the hair... you're still going to have to wipe the whole counter off either way."
1,As bad if not worse than the movie,"The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun! The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith)"
1,rated N for nobody,"This game is a joke! It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3. It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games. (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.) Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out. It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it. It should be rated N for Nobody!"
1,Only game I've truly hated to play,I played it for a few hours and gave it away. It was just not my cup of tea. Way too dark. Perhaps the name should have tipped me off.
1,"I'm sorry, but...","...this only applies to the Japanese version of the 5-star album. Everyone's raging about this Japanese version, so I bought it, paying the extra cash. What is the difference? There is none; Zero. All you get is a ""Made In Japan"" label, a cute little sleevelet on the left, the worst translation of lyrics on the face of the Earth that makes the translated lyrics to Cheap Trick's ""Live At Budokan"" look more tangible and zero difference in audio quality. One may debate that such is not the case; Good, that's subjective then. Save yourself the money, buy the American version and crank it louder. That'll make up for the difference and you can afford a decent lunch on what you save. Bon Appetit and ROCK ON!"
4,take the blindfold off,the last days of funk is prophecised here not a bad cd could have been stronger like trombipulation if george released some of the outtakes which popped up on the family series years later. not a bad cd though. gloryhallastoopid jams. but why the funk they put party people out. the big bang theory kicks [butt]. this track was made to be sampled truly underrated classic. the freeze is tight in the middle the mob goes off is that maceo. color me funky to me is a omen of the mothership going to crash. hearing that now makes me wish the funk was still here. theme of the black hole jams .the last song may we bang you sucks a lot. not a bad cd for tru funkateers only.
5,Dank Album For Cheap,"I Scored This Album for 6 bucks and it is one of the funkiest albums of all time. Not as beautiful as the motor-booty affair but it's still awesome. Bernie plays most the bass lines but he is not credited for writing any of the songs, Bernie also rocks the keyboards nicely on party people. Buy this album it's still better than rap"
4,Let me put my sunglasses on,"It's funkier than most. Maybe too funky for some. ""The Freeze"" is more than enough reason to buy this CD. It's a big funny jam. It grinds."
5,Magnificently Stoopid!,"I heard this album for the first time when I found it in my mom & dad's record collection. After the first few listens, I was hooked! I would wake up in the morning and put that record on countless times and get even more excited from jammin' it! I can sing this whole album word-for-word and note-for-note--even the instrumentals! And don't get me started on the cover artwork and inside illustrations throughout the album! That is like one of the main influences to my sketch artistry. As a matter of fact, when I'm getting ready to put together a new sketch drawing, I put this album, along with a few other Parliament albums, on and set them on 'repeat all'. That keeps my creative juices flowin'...the way EVERY SINGLE Parliament jam does!"
1,Don't Buy It!!!!!,"This music does not go with the books at all. First of all the names of the songs should be a clue. Unlike the Wheel of Time, the producer/producers of this music didn't really put much thought into making this. Listening to the music does not conjure up images of any part of the story. If i had to decide to read the books based on what the music is like, I wouldn't even look at the covers."
1,horrible,"Maybe the artist should have glanced at the cover on one of the books before starting this, reading one or two couldn't have hurt either.I may be wrong on the artist's goal, but due to the fact that the music fits in not at all with the books it appears that he wished to cash in on a big name, and this was it.Even modern instruments would have been OK, but electric keyboard? come on!!!"
1,You have to be kidding me..!!!!!!!,"Oh my God, thank God I listened before buying this in a compulsively stupid way. This is totally NOT a Wheel of Time soundtrack, at least if you try to focus yourself in a time of legends, magic, myths, Aes Sedai etc..it looks more like a bady country music CD. What is with Moraine's song!!??? an insult.This is proof that Jordan is just profiting with us, his loyal fans. BAD BAD BAD!"
4,Something for everyone,"Being a big fan of Robert Jordan's epic fantasy series the Wheel of Time, and a big fan of Magna Carta's other progressive releases, I knew I couldn't go wrong with this album. I think it captures the mood of the series very well. I must admit I wouldn't have thought there was that much of a celtic influence in Jordan's world, but it seemed to fit very well.The Soundtrack for the Wheel of Time has the epic quality I tend to look for in a soundtrack album, as well as the solid progressive styles I look for in albums by Yes and ELP. Of course, given composer Robert Berry's history with 3, I knew the prog rock sound was going to be handled well. Even the vocal tracks, while not my favorite parts of the album, were well done.Overall, this is an impressive release, and truly has something for everyone. It should be pleasing to fans of the series, fans of progressive music, fans of celtic music, and people who just enjoy music period."
1,"Ugh, crappy '80s fantasy music rides again.","Don't waste your money. This CD is nothing but a collection of songs reminiscent of bad '80s fantasy films all done by an amateur musician. There's no backbone to it, no real feeling. The whole vibe is of 'Oh, man, I made this cool noise on my synthisizer! Check it out!'. I did crap like that when I was 11, but have since learned the difference between that and *good* music! Just listening to the samples make me shudder. Personally, I don't care if this fits the series or not. All I know is that this music is something that anyone claiming to be a musician can do. Just bang around on your electric keyboard acting like you're Yanni, and that's the quality of this musician's CD."
1,The old grey mare isn't what she used to be.,"I was looking forward to using Borland again. I remember when they led the industry with their innovative IDE concepts. Well they haven't changed much since then. Of the three IDE platforms that I have used (Qt, Microsoft's Visual C++.net and Borland C++ Builder and VI) this comes in second to last. Come on Borland get back into the saddle. There are other annoying factors as well. Rebuilding each and every time I choose to run in debug, the depth of the class architecture, not to mention what has already been said. Sorry Borland... I was really hoping to say something quite different."
3,In Levinson's Baltimore again,"Richard Dreyfus and Danny DeVito play a couple of aluminum siding hucksters in Baltimore; after a minor car accident between the two they begin warring against each other in their businesses. Directed by Barry Levinson, who directed ""Diner,"" this movie is similar in approach and even locale: the ""main story"" is almost inconsequential to the series of side stories that take place. Some of this is funny, but not enough to call the picture a success. We just never really get involved with the characters, and they just seem to be going through their routines. The love story between Dreyfus and DeVito's wife (Barbara Hershey) is the worst part of the movie; it seems like only a tag-on. Best is Dreyfus and DeVito going at it toe to toe."
5,gem of a comedy...,"everything is so right about this film, the setting, the music, the acting. Really takes you back to the early 60's with Richard Dreyfuss, Barbara Hershy, Dany DeVito doing some of their finest work. The supporting cast is incredible, John Mahoney, Bruno Kirby, the familiar faces and great work just goes on and on. But it is the writing that really seperates this into the 'special' category. Great writing, great directing amd great acting make for a especially great comedy."
5,You'll Die Laughing,"This might be one of the best comedies of all time. I loved ""Diner"" and when I first saw Tin Men I couldn't believe that Barry Levinson had outdone himself.Danny DeVito gets the ""Bal'mer"" accent down to a ""T"" and Dryfuss is terrific as the oh-so-slick Bill Babowski (you know . . . they call him ""B.B""). The Capulet and Montegue competition between the competing aluminum siding companies is hillarious and the gags the guys pull on the poor sods who they're selling the stuff to just cracks me up every time I see it. This is one of DeVito's best movies in my view.Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of this movie for every room in your house so that you'll never be more than 20 feet away from it at any given time - - it's that good."
2,The Condescension of Anthropology,"This is the only book I've read in the past five years that I haven't finished. I stopped reading in disgust. Luhrmann is extremely patronizing to the population she's writing about, neopagans, and it drove me crazy.I also felt like she missed the point of what it is that we do. Most neopagans don't consider themselves as magicians primarily, and much of the ritual we do is not to create material results. Her point is that magic does not create material results but we act as though it does. I don't think either of those are necessarily true, and even if they were true, they're beside the point of a spiritual path.In Luhrmann's defense, the anthropology tradition has a long and venerated history of holding itself loftily above the people it studies. So perhaps it's not entirely her fault. But I don't think that redeems the book.I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Track Listing,Side 1-Heartbeat (The Clivilles Radio Mix)Side 2-Heartbeat (The Cole/Clivilles LP Version)
2,A bit dissapointed,Unfortunately the book is a copy (which is not why I'm complaining)...but at least make a good copy of the book. I am a bit dissapointed.
3,Pure silly slapstick -- an acquired taste,"The 3 star rating is mostly out of respect for Laurel and Hardy as pioneers of the medium, not to mention their multiple talents and charm such as I have rarely seen on the silver screen. But this item is purely a matter of taste. If yours runs to silent slapstick, this is as good a purchase as any. Otherwise, try the Laurel and Hardy talkies such as ""Flying Deuces"", or the Chaplin or Mae West movies."
4,Brothers in Arms,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was fast-paced and fun and the characters were well-developed. It was very reminiscent of ""Starship Troopers"" by Heinlein (the book, not the movie). I am eagerly awaiting the sequel."
1,Oh boy....,"This is what I think of the game...BLAHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now that that's out of the way, I can tell you all about this video game. You get to play as Oscar, the fish and do nothing but work at the Whale Wash, swim and fight a really nice shark that has a problem with killing animals like Oscar. Oscar doesn't need the title, Shark Slayer!! Anyway I can't tell you how a story about rapping fish came to be a video game. I mean Finding Nemo the video game wasn't that bad, but they made a really bad movie into an even worse video game. That is all."
1,Sawdust,"I usually do not take the time to review products, but I usually read reviews before I purchase them. I saw the negative comments on this jerky before I bought it, but figured these people were just crazy. I mean, how bad can beef jerky be. It's just beef jerky. Whoever said this jerky tasted like sawdust was 100% spot on. I eat tons of beef jerky, and this is by far the worst. I have the BBQ flavor, and there isn't a hint of BBQ anywhere. Sure the meat is tender, but it is sawdust.Please do not make the mistake and buy this product. You will definitely regret it. And to whoever described it as sawdust, you were 100% spot on. I can't believe how accurate that description was. I can not think of a better word to describe this jerky. DO NOT BUY"
2,Didn't like much,"I didn't like this beef jerky much, especially the texture. I do like the more natural ingredients, however."
5,Feast on the Priest,"I'm almost as old as them, I miss Rob, but I will watch this over and over. It is a good.Judas Priest - Live in London"
1,TOTAL waste of money. Nothing like the original.,"I guess this is a lesson learned in why you always stick with the classics.We bought 3 of these traps and none of them would stay set properly. We'd set them, put them down (as gently as humanly possible) and they'd pop. At first 2 of the 3 wouldn't stay latched when the arm was pushed down, then it got to be all of them. We tried and tried. We tried pushing them down gently, then forcefully. We tried setting them upside down, right side up, anything we could think of. The little latching mechanism just would not latch. It was infuriating to have wasted money on something that just flat out did not work.3 traps, all in the garbage. Never even had a chance to see if they'd work past the setup stage. Grr.Bummer."
1,It didn't work,I couldn't set it up when I got it because the lever didn't stay down. I returned it for a refund.
1,It looks good but doesn't work,"It looks really good, but it wouldn't even set, I kept slowly pushing the lever down several times. So I am returning it right now. This is the only product I have bought from amazon that I have returned."
1,Useless,"This product is pretty useless. It's way too small and it's hard to catch some ""smart"" mouse. I bought 2 of these and left them in the kitchen for 2 week. One day I saw the mouse ran across. The trap is still there and no mouse were caught..."
1,Trap is Hard to Set - Can't Catch A Thing,"Don't waste your money on this trap. It's hard to set, and hasn't caught one mouse. I bought the JT Eaton 409 Jawz traps and they work fine, but I also purchased the cheap old fashioned wooden traps and they work just as well for a fraction of the price. Between the wooden traps and the JT Eaton 409 Jawz traps, we've caught six mice so far."
1,"Catches, but does not kill, mice","I was really displeased with the performance of this trap. One of these traps caught a mouse the first night it was out, but failed to actually kill the mouse. When I released the mouse into the trash bin, it limped around, still alive. I had to dispatch the mouse myself to put it out of its misery. I do not recommend this trap."
1,d-Con covered snap mouse trap,"Last year, I ordered 12 of these. Out of the box, 3 of them didn't work. Durning the next three months, 3 of them failed. I discovered a little plastic hook that holds the trap open had broken off. This year, I decided to give it another try, even though at $5 per trap, I was uncertain. This year, out of a box of 12, again 3 failed to work and two have broken so far, leaving 7 out of 12.Looking more closely at the mechanism, I discovered there is a little pin near where the trap setting arm is when set. It keeps sliding out about 3/16ths of an inch and when I pushed it back in, found I could get the trap to work. With those that had a broken plastic hook to set the trap, there was no hope. I'm down to 9 traps that are still working but don't expect them to last the season.Next year, I'll go back to simple wooden traps. Cheaper and more effective."
2,Great idea; Poorly constructed.,"The latch that the lever is supposed to snap into is very poorly put together and slides around all the time making it really hard to set the trap. It took me half an hour to set the trap up the first time. Ultimately what I found was best was standing really close to wear you intend to set the trap up, pull back the lever and then stick a screw driver or knife into the opening to push the latch into place. This is the only way I could get this thing to work.I really like the idea of the design. I like that it is covered so that you (or a pet) don't accidentally set the trap off. I only wish that the latch was a bit more sturdy."
5,These traps work!,"After trying multiple types of traps and only have a.) less peanut butter and b.) more mouse droppings in the kitchen, we opted for these traps. After reading the reviews, I hit the order button. I am glad I did! We caught a mouse within hours! The spin traps, the humane mouse house, all those did not work for us. I will be ordering more d-con mouse traps."
3,Works well when it works,"Read the other positive reviews because when this trap works it works well. But the problem I have is with the lever. Tonight I spent 20 minutes and it wouldn't stay down. I bought three, so tried another one. It took several minutes but it finally stayed down. As I mentioned, the trap works well when the lever is down, and I've caught a couple mice. But the problem with trying to get the lever to stay down is frustrating. If someone knows a way to resolve this let me know. Otherwise I'll still be buying two for every one that works."
1,Sucks,"I have had two of these traps out, back to back, baited with peanut butter for 2 weeks and nothing! In that time, I've seen the mouse walking around the traps without even giving them a second look. As much as I hate seeing dead mice, I think I will have to return to the traditional snap traps if they don't catch something soon."
3,mouse trap,"I had purchased these traps previously. This time, the quality was not as good. They didn't last as long and plastic parts wore out too fast."
1,Hard to reset,"Bought these traps in hope a getting rid of some mice. I am 100%disabled so I figured, according to the package instructions that they'd be easy to reset. I was wrong. I bought 5 traps. First one out of box would not set at all. I figured out that I had to press down on a plastic latch inside the trap to get it to set. Caught one mouse in this particular trap and it never was able to reset it again. At $4.99 per trap, makes for a very expensive mouse.. I originally bought these traps because they were resettable and didn't have to touch a diseased ridden mouse. Out of 5 traps I purchased only 3 have been resettable. I would highly recommend that your design engineers get back to the drawing board. VERY DISAPPOINTING. Expected much more from D-CON"
4,Another goodie from Home Spun,"I own several Home Spun instructional CDs and DVDs. I enjoy them all, and they've made me a better musician.This is another good one. James explores the music of Yank Rachell, breaks down a couple of tunes, and then plays and sings for us. I've also taken some of the techniques James decribes and applied them to other tunes.You could easily spend an entire day or even a weekend studying and playing what's included on this DVD, which I think makes it well worth the $20. I mean, where alse can you take a music lesson and spend all the time you want with the teacher for only twenty bucks?Also try the Home Spun Sam Bush DVDs. Awesome stuff. Com'on, you couldn't hire Sam Bush to be your teacher, but here you can have several hours of him, and play the DVDs over and over."
2,There's only one good song I like on here!,"That's got to be a duet performed by Jennifer Warnes and Joe Cocker called ""Up Where We Belong"". From my Joe Cocker anthology [BOX SET] two double-disc collection I only just have on CD. Mostly the rest of these tunes on this movie soundtrack are just not suitable for anything here to my taste of music listening enjoyment instead forget it!"
4,"An talent once greatly needed, disappears to oblivion","A very detailed accounting of one of the last Wheelwrights. To appreciate the book, one must be familiar with woodworking at some level. Mr. Sturt paints a picture of someone with professional skills in the repair and making of wagons, carts, and wheelbarrows. The book may be of interest to those unfamiliar with woodworking but appreciate the long apprenticeship required to become a fullfledged wheelwright. Tis sad that a talent so needed for thousands of years, including Egypt and Rome, disappears. When the wagon factories and the automobile came about this made the wheelwright obsolete....."
5,A fine read for the woodworker,I enjoyed this book as it gives a look at a 19th century wheel and cart building business. The author writes clearly and I was kept fascinated at how wheels and carts were made fully by hand. The craftsmanship needed was impressive. A good read.
5,WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE R&B AND FUNK,"This is one of the best and most creative and musically stimulating albums in existence. If you're looking for something to move you, to make you think, and to make you feel music completely differently, YOU NEED PARLIAMENT. All I can say is try it, and if it isn't for you, YOU AREN'T READY YET!!"
1,Good PR book,"Unfortunately this turned out to be merely a public relations book for Mary Donaldson of Tasmania, Australia...who became the Crown Princess of Denmark. Falsehoods, exaggerations, and omissions about Mary's history (dating relationships, friends, live-in lovers, unstable job history, her hanging out with Crown Prince Frederik in the Slip Inn ""pick-up"" bar in Sydney) made it shallow reading. It reads like a public relations campaign, with a false ""edge"" given to the reader to try to make it appear that the real Mary is in the book. However, the real Mary Donaldson is missing. It may well be that Danish journalist cannot research and write objectively about the royalty they support with their taxes. Pehaps in such a small country it is not ""wise"" to write truthfully about the royal family if you want to get ahead and/or keep your job. But it was certainly a pretty book and pleasant coffee-table reading. Perhaps that is the real purpose?"
1,It easily breaks whilst in your pocket,"Road warriors beware. Note that the card sticks out of the palm unit when inserted into the SD slot. Therefore if you place it in your pants pocket awkwardly and accidentally knock it against something, either the card will dislodger or break. Don't buy this if you are prone to dropping the unit as well.Also note that very few cases for the Palm M515 have a cut out for easy access to the SD slot."
5,Very cool. Very Useful,"I recently bought an Ericsson t39m and have combined it with the Palm m515. The combination works seemlessly. I can surf the web, send e-mail and do SMS with the phone hooked to my belt. This is an excellent addition for those who want truly mobile communication."
3,"Works well, but sticks out more than I expected.",The card sticks out so far that holsters/holders are not functional on my treo 650. May work great on other devices... Otherwise functioned as advertised.
3,Hard going for non-chefs,"This book is ideal for chefs but rather hard going for non-chefs. This book is filled with culinary jargon that is a foreign language to the lay person. However, if you can navigate your way through all this, you will have a good read."
3,"great subject, poor execution","I think that the subject of cooking school is definitely one worthy of a book. If another book comes out about it, I'd probably read it too, in hopes that it would be better than this one. First of all, the book jacket is misleading in that the author didn't actually attend the full CIA program, he only sat in on certain classes. Also, the writing seemed very scatter-brained. The book contains a bit too much tedious kitchen play-by-play that doesn't always contribute to the overall story. Still, the program and personalities are interesting enough to overcome the disappointing execution."
3,Definitely worth reading...,"I am currently a CIA student. Started here in October of 1998. I read this book over the summer before starting school and I LOVED the book. Ruhlman writes very well. He made it very apperant that passion is the cornerstone to the Culinary Arts. If you want to be a chef, you've got to have a passion for it. Otherwise, you're just a cook. Having said all this, however, I can see that the book would have been so much better if he had gone through the entire program and endured exactly what we real students have to endure. It's not easy, but it is more fun than I have ever had in my life. I didn't realize how great it really was until I was two months into the program. As I've said, Ruhlman paints a pretty picture about the experience, but it gives you a different view of the school than you expect to receive once becoming a student here. Anyway, it's definately worth it, just don't have too many expectations."
1,"Pro: Title, Con: Content","Don't waste your time or money on this one. Give me a ring, and I will ship it to you for free."
5,There Are Few Better Guitarists Than Steve Morse,I love everything this guy does. Jazz cats can dig him...Rock cats can dig him....Country cats can dig him....He's the archetypal American guitarist.
5,"Pure genius, classic instrumental perfection","Tone, technique, taste, texture. The Steve Morse Band's close-to-perfection album. Sublime guitar fireworks, arguably the best rhythm team in Van Romaine on drums and Dave la Rue on bass (this side of Dave La Rue and Virgil Donati!) this is a colossal album with no fillers. 'Eyes of a Child' and 'Four Minutes to Live' are perhaps SM's most emotional masterpieces put to publishing, and from the opening title track to the closing 'Live to Ride', this is a barnstormer of an album. Morse's trademark licks are there, but it's the pure melody and structure in which he has the uncanny ability to ensure enters his albums, that sets him apart from his contemporaries. This really is modern-day Beethoven and Schubert, in your ears; it has class written all over it."
3,berkley bee ess,"Caution: Contains SpoilersNever before have I seen such a desparate production of absurdity painted as hopefully possible.In a nutshell: An average mildly conservative college boy entering his last summer before college graduation, give him a gangster dad, a minimum wage job where his more-mature boss sexually harasses him, then introduce a beautiful young couple that both seduce him to spend his last summer with them, partying, vacationing, home invasion, robbery, riding her, getting ridden by him, and of course choosing to continue getting ridden by him, since that's so much better than Sienna Miller (duh!) ... what a gem of a storyI'll give it 3 stars; the acting, directing, and cinematography were all top notch; the story itself is totally absurd. If it were more honest, it would have painted the protagonist as more gay to begin with.. because average college guys dont take it in the can."
4,Very nice bag,"I use this bag for swimming and it gives me the space I need for everything. I wish the side pocket had netted dividers for bottles, as it is I just had a roll-up shower tote I use separately. Great features though and appears to be very good construction."
3,"Good, But Not Great","For the longest time the only DNC album I had was ""Fly Me Courageous"". This album was so out-standing I couldn't believe this band wasn't huge. After hearing ""Mystery Road"" I think I have abetter understanding. This isn't a bad album by any stretch, but it doesnt have the sameinfectious grooves as FMC. The best songs on this album can be found on other compilation albums,most notably, ""The Essential Live Drivin N' Cryin"" which I own; ""Honeysuckle Blue"", ""Straight ToHell"", ""Peacemaker"" and ""House For Sale"" can all be found on the live album in much strongerform. For the just-curious or beginning DNC fan I would recommend this route."
1,Confused,How can the MP3 Download NOT include the title track? Low Spark IS part of the album called Low Spark....What gives here?
5,Great Band,"Everyone in this band was exceptional, of course Steve Winwood is the most popular name and he is fantastic, but Woods on the sax is great, Cappola on the Drums unreal."
5,Lipsyte is an amazing new talent,"The Subject Steve is my favorite book of the year. Like Lipsyte's story collection, Venus Drive, it is funnier than hell while also being confrontational and smart. One of the amazing talents Lipsyte displays is his stamina. There's not a bad page in here. It is so consistently strong that you may lose your breath or get dizzy. A little like Chuck Palahniuk but actually more interesting stylistically. Simply dazzling."
2,Not what I expected,"I am 6 months pregnant and was in real need of a good warm foot massager. It had all the features but they don't live up to what I thought they would be. The removeable foot rollers are too big and painful as someone else mentioned, I just take them out. The bubbles do splash water all over the floor. There is a feature that says it will maintain the temp. of the water, but it doesn't, it gets cold quick. The manicure massager is ok, but it is in an awkward place. The vibration and the bubbles are nice but that's about it. Also, there should be a selection for bubbles only (without vibration). And there is NO fill line as the directions say!"
2,Too greasy,"Left hair too greasy looking and I was allergic to some ingredient (I tend to be sensitive), will not keep buying."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE!!!,"Why would a simple cologne sell for almost $1,800?! That is just pure ridiculous! You are a fool if you spend your hard earned money on this perfume."
5,High Quality,"I use this canner approximately twice a month. I bought it about 6 months ago and it is a wonderful product. It's nice that there are no moving parts to replace. I don't need to worry about the dial guage being calibrated. The canner comes with an EXCELLENT recipe book! The shrimp creole and beef stroganoff are absolutely delicious and easy to make. My husband was really impressed.I highly recommend this canner, along with the 22-quart from the same company. They are both excellent and should last a lifetime. This canner is an excellent value as well."
2,Mirro 12 qt pressure canner,"The size description online and what it really is does not match. Mirro knows there is a manufacturing malfunction and has nothing to replace it with. It will not hold the usual 7 canning quart jars, only 5 and then the lid will not close with the jars inside."
5,Great value,"Works great with my older Dewalt sensor. It's not something I'll use everyday, but with some care I would think it would hold up well to daily use. Beats the price I've seen in the stores. I'm happy with the purchase."
3,Doesn't subsitute for flavored coffee creamer,"I was hoping to find a good-tasting, low calorie alternative to flavored coffee cream. Unfortunately this product really didn't really do that. It does sweeten black coffee but not to the extent of actually giving it a great vanilla flavor. I found it better to just use regular artificial sweetener. The WORST part about these packets is that they are IMPOSSIBLE to open! I had to keep a scissors next to my coffee pot to cut the tops off of the packets. Ripping them open requires some secret trick that they don't tell you about and I still haven't figured out..."
2,It's Ok,"I was estatic when I seen that Splenda was coming out with Flavor Blends for coffee. I wasn't to fond of it after I got it. More sugary tasting .. not as expected, Very disappointed"
2,Not to expectations,"When I ordered the flavored sweetener I had high hopes for a great product but this Splenda French Vanilla Flavor Blend falls short, especially in black coffee. I have tried it sprinkled on fresh popcorn which is a much better use than in coffee. Looking forward to other uses."
1,Battle of the Century,"Do not buy this video unless you enjoy straining your eyes trying to read pages of typed script. Great sections of the film are missing and in their place are shots of blury script pages. Then they go to a tiny film segment and back to the script. More than unenjoyable, it's down right enoying!"
4,A great way to plan a golf trip to Scotland,"I have two editions of Allan Ferguson's Golf in Scotland. To me, it is the cornerstone of a self-planned Scottish golf trip. His course reviews are clear and informative as he includes critical contact information. He gives insight into hotel and B & B choices that are helpful without the ""chamber of commerce"" sound. With his books my group and I have been to Scotland 3 times without a misstep. Allan is also interactive with you if you communicate with him. It makes the book more personable."
5,Worth a trip to Scotland,"The concise, practical and well presented info in this book can help you take two trips to Scotland. I bought a second book for my son because I didn't want to part with mine."
1,A Musicmatch compatible to Windws 7 ?,"Musicmatch obviosly is not interested in creating software compatible with Windows 7. Last year I purchased Musicmattch from Yahoo. They claimed it was compatible with Windows Home Premium. I payed $79. and change.It did not work. Yahoo did not answer my E mail, or return my money. Past history. When is Musicmatch moving into the 21st century? I had Musicmatch on my old computer, with Windows ME. I loved it. Robert."
4,Forrest Gump?,"The Forrest Gump of her era, Pope Joan could do no wrong and had the Midas touch. The fictional parts of this historical novel are quite fantastic; the historical parts are great so it is definitely worth reading."
4,Hmmmmmmm?,"First of all, this is a very thought provoking story.There is so much more to this book than just pope Joan.It's her life's struggles beginning with her entry into the world the night she was born. Nothing came easy to Joan. She was very creative and selfsufficient, even at a young age.This book will make any woman glad she wasn't living during The Dark Ages.Joan had an intelligent mind to use and since women weren't allowed that privilege back then, she disguised herself as a man and used the brain she was given.I liked the medicinal uses of herbs and spices all through this book.There's also a touch of romance run through this book on a very tiny thread, enough to keep a reader turning pages.The ending is a total surprise and it's a book well worth reading."
3,Intriguing premise . . . Flawed Execution,"The legend of Pope Joan can neither be confirmed or denied . . . Unfortunately this book does little to advance the dialogue. Although Ms. Cross does offer some brief historical notes at the conclusion of the novel, this book is more grounded in fiction than research or reality. Those readers who bought the book looking for some clarification of the historical circumstances that might have supported Pope Joan's existence and reign will be disappointed. On the other hand, those readers who bought the book looking for an interesting story of how a the Catholic church's medieval hierarchy would have forced talented female to resort to a deception of the highest order to fulfill her spiritual and intellectual potential will probably enjoy Ms. Cross' tale."
1,Anti-Catholic,I would only read this if you have an axe to grind with the Catholic church and are looking to stoke the flames.
3,A familiar story,"This book was well written, but far too reminiscent of several others out there. Foreshadowing was a bit too obvious. But in all a fun read."
5,"Cynthia - Manhattan Beach, California",I picked this book up in Europe because I had lost another book and needed something to read on the train. I was SO surprised at how good it was! It held my attention from start to finish and my 14 year old daughter read it after I was finished with it. It is outstanding - her writing is excellent and the story is spellbinding. Pick it up - you won't put it down!
4,Kept me interested,If I am bored with a book I do not continue to read it to the end. This book kept my interest. I loved learning about how far women have come in society. And we owe it to the brave women of the past who have paved the road for us! Thanks ladies!
3,"""Book Club Sin Nombre"" Review","Our book club in Cancun read Pope Joan for March. We agreed that the topic was very interesting (we want to believe there was a woman pope), the historical aspects engaging (details of life in the dark age & certain characters like the midwife and some clergy), and the overall writing style was fairly good. If we hadn't read this book with a critical eye, we might have been able to enjoy it more. But we also add that many aspects of the plot seemed rather desperate (as if contrived with great effort). Some characters got lost and we wondered where they went. Would have liked to enter Joan's ""head"" more deeply. Thought the love story was a bit far-fetched. In general, we think it wasn't a bad book, and many people will love it. But those of us who lent it out right away aren't too anxious to get it back into our home selection."
5,Excellent Book,"Fat Assassins (The Fat Adventure Series)I love historical fiction and this book didn't disappoint. This is a fascinating topic and Donna Woolfolk Cross did a great job. She developed an elegant heroine and encapsulated the reader into the story. I read it in an entire sitting because I needed to know how it ended.If you like Phillipa Gregory, you'll enjoy this book.I was happy to see the book adapted to film (and later a TV miniseries). I haven't watched the series yet and I hope they did justice to the book."
1,Little Hope for Joan the Pope,"I was eager to read this book for I was expecting an exacting, honest account of a female pope and her trials . . . well the book delivers the factoids and that's about it. In the hands of a more deft author, this book could have dazzled its readers. But, unfortunately, it comes across as silly and adolescent."
4,Fascinating fiction,"Who knows how much of this is true, but with a lot of history included, it made for a very interesting read!"
2,Pope Joan,"The book was fine and I enjoyed the story. The reason for 2 stars is it was advertised as (new) and that is what I expected. As I read the book I ran across notes that someone had written on some of the pages. Hard for me to beleive it was new. The book was fine, It is the seller that I question"
4,Drops you into history,"A ton of research obviously went into this book, so you can learn a lot about a period that we don't know very much about at all. The best thing about this book, for me, is how it bore very little resemblance at all to most female-oriented historical fiction like, for example, ""Borgia Bride"" by Kalogridis (which I hated, but that's another review). No overly familiar 1st person. No 21st century American sorority girl disguised as a medieval Italian prostitute or noblewoman. These people feel really foreign, like they could have lived 1000 years ago. At the same time, the protagonist is an ardent feminist, but realistically so, and a really admirable character study.The quality of the book drops off towards the end, after Joan actually becomes pope; it just feels too rushed.I hope the author will come out with something new soon!"
5,An utterly fascinating book,"A young girl in the Middle Ages, bright and keen to learn but is forbidden to do so by tradition. But she gets there, and when the Vikings brutally attack the village where she is staying and her brother is amongst those killed, she cuts off her hair, takes his clothes and enters a monastery as John. Keeping her identity a secret has its problem, but she rises through the ranks and eventually reaches the highest position in the Church. Fact of fable? Who knows? What I do know is that the book is well written, I found it a well integrated story and that the portrayal of life in the Middle Ages was fascinating. It was difficult to put down the book, passed it on to many of my friends and bought more copies as presents."
1,Just Awful,"Personally, this CD wasn't as good as i hoped and thought it'd be. The only songs that i don't skip are ""Something i can Never Have"", ""Heresy"", and sometimes ""Hurt"" and ""Ruiner"". The guys vocals are really bad. Versailles rendition is pretty good, i think one of the best on the compilation. ""We're in This Together"" is ok, but that guy's voice is just...undescribably annoying. -sigh- this could have been as good as the Piano Tribute. I highly recommend the Piano Tribute to Nine Inch Nails."
4,Keeps 'em busy,"I gave this to my 4 year old niece for Christmas. The rest of the evening was spent chasing the ladybug around. The other two girls (ages 5, 2) got in on the action too."
4,2 year old loved it,perfect toy for little tots.it came fast and price was cheep for remote control toy.
1,IT SUCKS,"I got this,and boy does it SUCK!I mean, when I open the box, and take her out, her arms fall off,so we went out to the toy store and got a refund.This one lasted longer, but still broke, and I only kept her in a glass case, and when I moved her, there her arms go!I can't play with it cause mum says that her arms will fall off again, and she dose not want to glue them back on.Well,mum knows best..."
5,Turbo charged! This unit rocks!,"This trimmer is excellent due to two batteries so it has plenty of power when the batteries start to run down. Sturdy, solid high speed unit, easy to clean, blade stays put when cover comes off. Bad smell(reported below)? You're kidding, right, it's a friggin' electric trimmer!"
2,Why?,"One can only guess these 2 romantic comedies are being packaged together because both rank pretty high on the 'leads who have no onscreen chemistry in a romantic comedy' list. Both have relatively good stories, pretty good direction (Serendipity in particular is quite creative), solid (if a little cliched) performances and lots of studio $$$ behind them, but both fall flat from an utter lack of chemistry. I'm only reviewing this duo because it popped up as the highest ranked romantic comedy on Amazon today- and both are among a handful of movies I have seen during which I thought ""these leads really seem to dislike each other"".Kate & Leopold and Serendipity are in regular circulation on the pay TV channels. If you're in the mood for a great romantic comedy, buy 'Holiday', 'It Happened One Night', 'Cousin, Cousine', 'Sense and Sensibility' or anything with Hepburn and Tracy."
5,cloned funk is aquired,the introduction to dr. funkenstein bangs from the beginning to the last song a must for true funkateers get this if you love parliament and experience the kind of artist glen goins could have been had he lived buy it
3,this translation leaves a lot unsaid,"i really enjoyed the motorcycle diaries. when the movie was in theatres i decided to read the book first so that i could understand the film better, but i chose to read it in the original spanish version. it was thought provoking prose. i was impressed that such insight came from the child of a wealthy argentinean family. when i read the translation in english i was a little disappointed. i did think that it was very good, but a little bit of the nuance is lost. if at all possible i suggest that you read it in the original spanish text, it is a little bit more inspiring."
3,Che Guevara: Hindsight is 20/20,"Che Guevara's Motorcycle Diaries is a sloppy after-thought of South America and its indiginous peoples. At the age of 22, Che, a medical student, decides to travel to fulfill his ""wanderlust."" During his travels, he has not yet arrived at his revolutionary credo and does not, even in the beginning, give an inkling as to the possibility of travel to explore the lives of the proletariat. He is simply travelling because he is young and his friend has a motorcycle. Che, however, rewrites his diaries years later when he is living in Cuba and injects all the ""insight"" into the sorry lives of the natives. Hindsight is 20/20 but lets be realistic, this is not an account by a 22 year old. It is a retelling of the story by a weathered revolutionary. It lacks any of the exciting self-discovery which travel should inevitably lead one to; apparently the self-discovery comes much later. The Motorcycle Diaries is a good travel guide and not much else."
3,Love this Magazine - Will Not Subscribe!,"I love this magazine! I know - it's ""inferior intellectual reading"" but it provides hours of fun and relaxation and takes my mind away from all the mundane things in my life. With that said, I will not subscribe to it. The newsstand price is $2.99. Subscription price is about $2.00 per magazine BUT these types of subscriptions never arrive on time. It is extremely upsetting to read these ""latest"" news one or two weeks behind. One of the pleasures of reading this type of material is to have the timely information. I will pay extra but will be up to date on the latest news."
1,this magazine is horrible,"i hate this magazine. it always comes late, if at all. i don't have any problems with the other magazines i subscribe to. buyer beware!"
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this item on 22 June 2011 but for one reason and another did not play it until October. Instead of Discs 1 and 2, I received Disc 1 and The Singles 1969-1973. The Singles contained seven duplicates from Disc 1 and only five from Disc 2, so I was missing nine from Disc 2. Very disappointing."
5,Great TV!,"We have two of these, and they are fantastic! The only thing to know is you cannot view in anything but widescreen. Anything not widescreen, will be stretched to become widescreen. Still a great little TV!"
2,I took this back the same day.,"After hooking this up the same way I had my 21"" Philips tube TV, using the s-video and the audio... I got no sound from the tv.Changing back to the channels the sound is OK, BUT! on certain channels, the sound will switch AUTOMATICLY to the SAP audio.This was unacceptable! For me to have to switch the audio back to the proper audio channel, is stupid!I have never had a TV that did this. And there is only one setting to try to fix this, and it's called ENGLISH."
1,this is just wrong,"The first time I saw a commercial for one of these CD's I thought that it was a joke. Well, I was at Best Buy a few days later, and BEHOLD! there was a ""Kidz Bop"" CD. Alright, I will admit that this isn't a terrible idea, but something about it just isn't right. At least these aren't intelligently written songs in the first place, so I won't complain that Kidz Bop is somehow damaging the integrity of legitimate musicians. But come on, is there anyone out there who really thinks its normal for 4 year old kids to be singing about alcohol, drugs, and sex? I'm not going to argue that this is going to ruin the kids forever, but that just isn't natural. Plus the guy singing sounds like wierd Al. Okay, that's all."
1,Stink on ice!,Why would they make a cd this for little kids? Some of those songs are meant for 13 year old kids. They aren't meant for preschoolers. Hoe can these kids in the song know what they are talking about. They don't know love! Have they ever been in love? They are not meant for kids. Next they are going to have Eminem on the next cd.
5,Birthday Present...Great Gift,My father was so excited to get this video for his birthday. My mother purchased the first five seasons but could not find season 6 for less than $85.00. I found it on Amazon much cheaper and it was brand new! The item shipped quickly and was received within days of my order. I have just ordered another item from Amazon and I will continue to use Amazon for Holiday and Birthday Purchases. So far I have always received top quality merchandise from Amazon.
1,Terrible Packaging,"I am an avid blu-ray collector with nearly 800 in my collection. For some reason, HBO decided to put Season 6 Part 1 and 2 in a case that is a full inch taller than a standard blu-ray case. This package doesn't fit on the blu-ray shelf. I seriously considered sending it back to Amazon just because of the packaging. I have many HBO shows on blu-ray and S6: Part 1 & 2 are the only ones with this packaging. I also have season 1 and it is in a normal package."
5,Don't stop,"I'm really going to miss looking forward to Sunday nights at 8:00. I loved this show and am going to preorder Season 6, Part 2 as soon as I'm done typing this though I don't like the high price but HBO knows the can get away with it.I disagree with all the people saying that Part 2 was a disappointment. Most of the past seasons started slowly and built up to a big season finale. In my opinion David Chase did the same thing here. You couldn't take your eyes off the TV during the last episode. It was perfect.Tony didn't get killed. His life went, ""On and on and on."" I won't, ""...Stop believing."""
5,Last season was the best of the entire series,"What is it like to be Tony Soprano? You'll find out in the last five minutes and get to experience the paranoia, suspicion lurking everywhere. You'll never know when it happens and Tony knows it. A life that's consistently on the edge and always having to be alert, Chase does a wonderful job giving us a real glimpse inside the man we've been watching for years."
5,Sopranos DVD,"Great service! My son was thrilled to get this DVD to complete his collection. Even though the show ended awhile back my son and I are still big fans of this series. I didn't like the bad language, scenes of nudity, and adultery themes, myself, but I cannot take away from the talent of these actors. It was like they were all made to do this show. Perfect casting! The last episode was weird how it ended, but the Soprano's immediate family is all still alive in case someone wants to do a Soprano's 2 someday! My favorite show is the one directed by Steve Buscemi about Paulie and Christopher getting lost in the woods in the dead of winter. That one was downright hilarious!"
5,Ended well!,"This series is one of my favorites of all time. Lots of controversy about the end, but how else could they have done it and please everyone? I think it was apt and fitting and moving. BRAVO!"
4,Works well for chicks,"I have about 4 of these that I use for baby chicks. The other reviewer is correct that they break easily, but I have found that mine last for years if I am careful and not rough with them.I prefer metal over plastic, and this way I can use some canning jars as the container."
1,"Awful, awful, awful, awful...","This was one of my worst kindle buys - the plot was bizarre, badly designed and illogical, e.g. the monsters were easily killed by guns but all guns are rapidly lost or lost or (it gets better!) left behind after being used once. I do not know how on earth this could get 5 star reviews. Absolute dross."
1,I was very disappointed by this work.,"There is much in it, for certain, but little that does more than to validate personal denial. The techniques that are required to defend oneself against astral entities are far more complicated and demanding than this books suggests. As such, I personally feel it is incomplete to the point of being dangerous."
2,Thelema Inspired Defense Magick,I started reading this and I stopped because the Author uses Thelema inspired Crowley magic. I am not a fan of this sort of magic. Maybe I'll pick it up again just to see what else it has to offer but I was really turned off by it when I started reading it.
5,Recently discovered an amazing classic album,"I've recently begun working my way through R.E.M.'s complete catalog in chronological order and, never having been exposed to it before, Murmur was a powerful start. This is a great album outside of any other considerations. When I think about it being recorded in 1983, my mind is blown. ""Radio Free Europe"", ""Catapult"", and ""Talk About the Passion"" are my standouts."
2,Shaking Through? More Like Shaken Down,"23 dollars? For a remastered version of 'Murmur' and a concert that, as someone else said, has been available online for years? Compare this to the Pavement reissues that are currently going on, which contain twice the music included here (the original album remastered, concerts, b-sides, outtakes, non-lp tracks) and are sold for the price of a single CD (14 dollars on Amazon for a brand new copy.) Keep in mind, this is not a review of the music, which in my opinion is some of the best ever made (and the only reason this isn't a 1-star review.) But I was literally shocked by the price. The ironic thing is, 'Murmur' was originally sold at a lower list-price (I think it was a dollar less) when originally issued. Making up for lost time, I guess."
2,Lack of imagination,"I am becoming very disappointed with Mr. Patterson. This book seems as though it was written just to satisfy the public and get a book out for the Christmas season. It was slow moving, a very simple, untangled plot which could be easily put down and while the ending is a surprise it is almost anticlimatic. When will we see the old James Patterson of Cat and Mouse and Kiss the Girls???? Please return or give up."
1,Irrelevant Ending,"The book which starts off the chain of mystery thrillers with Alex Cross as the main character. It is pretty interesting up til the last few pages. The clues dropped along the way were just not relevant or enough to lead the reader to the identity of the murderer. If you are not a die-hard thriller fan (the kind of person who just loves to guess the identity of the murderer), it is a rather entertaining read."
3,Hated The Ending,"I got this book to read on the plane as I usually like this murder thrillers for travel. Overall I enjoyed the book but was not at all prepared for the ending. Or the non ending I sould say. In this kind of novel, gererally the good guy catches the bad guy at the end and all's happily ever after. Not so here. So because of this I won't be reading more. An end which is only the beginning of the next book is not a plot trick I appreciate. I do like Alex Cross and family...but Patterson appears to be unable to let his main character ever be HAPPY. Too unsettling. There's enough unhappiness in the world, I read a novel to escape and have the good guys win.Dawn Meredith"
3,Room for more,I will have to say that this book was both riveting and dissappointing. The subplots didnt make much sense (Cross's daughter's illness) but I loved the surprise ending. What he lacked is linkage...there were alot of holes in how the robbers tied to the mastermind and how he had time to find them and when. That was my most dissappointing moment after the end...you realize that Patterson didnt use details as in previous books. BUT for the record...I really enjoyed this book because of the ending. It will make for an excellent sequal if it isnt rushed by Patterson or his publishing company.
2,Major Disappointment,"This is the first book I've read by this popular author. And it will be the last. The plot was just interesting enough to keep me wondering how the book would end, but the writing style was way too simple-minded and predictable for my taste. I kept thinking ""2nd-grade primer"".Several years ago I saw a movie adapted from one of his books, and it was good. Perhaps his stories are better told on the screen."
3,Is there an order form at the end of the book?,"As an avid James Patterson fan, I was excited to get my hands on his latest! As I raced through the book in no time flat, exlaiming aloud on the final chapters - never have I been more frustrated! I'm all for surprise endings and being a bit misguided as to who the killer is - but puh-leeze! Surprised and angry are the only words I can drescribe for this ending! I feel like I was taken to the edge, only to be left unfulfilled! I'm assuming we're supposed to sign up right now to receive the sequel. I think Mr. Patterson was spending too much time in the heads of his misguided characters. That or his publishing deadline snuck up too quickly. Unfortunately I'm a sucker who will bite, and be back for the next one."
1,These Roses are BLUE!,What a HUGE disapointment! I though that Cradle And All was just a fluke.....WRONG! Again 400 pages;(and 121 chapters? C'mon now!) but boil out the dead space and it seems like almost 100. A wonderful premise; (but Greg Iles does it better in 24 Hours) with way too much backround family information that is just filler. A truly unbelievable ending; unsatisfying and just plain awful. The only point would be to set up a sequal; one I will not waste my money on. I know suspension of belief is part of a read; but I can't believe ANYONE will buy catching the wrong killer twice and missing the third one all in 29 pages (and 11 chapters?) I read literally hundreds of best sellers a year and have loved Patterson in the past. This is just a huge disapointment; and my last Patterson!
2,This is a book that doesn't take a lot of thinking,"If you enjoy books that you can just whip through in one day then this is the book for you. This was an easy read, a little to easy for my tastes. The chapters were very small and the story was missing something. If you enjoy books where you have no idea who the killer is and you just can't quiet pick out the one who did it then get another book. The ending left a lot to be desired. So if you like a quick easy book Roses Are Red is it. If you need a little more suspence and action then don't bother with this one."
1,Roses are Wilted,"I love mystery stories -- those by Ludlum, Marcia Mueller, Anne Perry, Michael Connelly, William Bernhardt, Bill Pronzini and Michael Palmer -- to name just a few off the top of my head. This was the first time I read James Patterson -- and UGH...It is so slipshod -- and the ending is just for shock value -- no preparation -- no follow through -- I felt as if I was being set up for the NEXT book....but you can be sure I will not read it. And the style -- there are 126 Chapters all about 2 pages long, large print, extensive margins -- and no content...And the characters leave a lot to be desired. PLEASE, PLEASE -- maybe someone else is ghost-writing Mr. Patterson's books... I have to say the plot was thrilling and interesting...but the execution (forgive the pun) was poor. PLEASE forwarn your readers....skip the roses...this time...no accolades, no flowers and no champagne on this one."
4,Roses Are Red,As with all Alex Cross Novels. Well written excellent plot. Kept ones interest throughout the book. A page turning novel.
3,Very disappointed,"Patterson's books are known for their twists and turns as well as brutality. But this one is a real downer. It destroys one of the good FBI guys we've enjoyed in all the Alex Cross books by making him the VERY perverted perp. This book also is a real downer because of the situation with Christine, the mother of his new son from the previous book. And the final chapter involving his new girl friend is a real downer as well. I've read all of Patterson's books so far. I will not read anymore and certainly will not purchase any more."
4,Sequel must be along the way?,"I have been reading Mr. Patterson's 'Alex Cross' series for almost a year now, and as usual, I check out if there's a new one coming... I find Mr. Patterson's book easy to read, with those short chapters, can't put-down books and I enjoy reading them.Keep it up. Can't wait for the next one though..."
5,Alex Cross top dog,"The way James Patterson writes is excellent. He creates great characters and details them so you can imagine yourself as that person. This was the first Alex Cross book I have read and plan on reading more. I would highly recommend reading all of the Alex Cross series books. Wonderfully written, keeps your attention and you just can't put the book down."
3,He can't write the way he used to,"It was a fast read, but I don't think he can write very well anymore. I used to love James, but his past few books have dissapointed me. It was fun to read at times, but boring most of the time. The ending was surprising, if implausable. The best thing I can say is that he is easy to read with his writing style. Let's hope the next one lives up to ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""See How They Run."" Get it together James! I know you can do it!"
3,ok,kind of slow....didnt like the ending. wishing the mastermind had been caught. also didnt like how the story dragged along
5,Chilling ride!,"Patterson, the master thriller author does it again with new alex cross shocker.Cross faces his most terrifying opponent yet, evil criminal genius called mastermind who has engineered deadly string of bank-robberies and the cold-blooded murders of the hostages.I defy anyone to start this book and not want to finish it in one sitting! Patterson is the master of suspense as he takes you into the mind of his villian and you worry as Cross's personal life seems to unravel as he battles the mastermind.The plot twists of this novel are fiendishly clever and Patterson says the best for last with a final denoucement on the last sentence that will surprise and chill you!"
3,Twisted Patterson/Book reader,"This the second book I am reading by James Patterson. My first on was 'When The Wind Blows', it was excellent. Then I wanted to expand my horizons and decided to read my first Alex Cross book, 'Roses Are Red'. I really enjojed the read, except for the ending. Patterson's twist and turns, and the several endings, only to leave you hanging, upset me. But, I remembered that I heard a new Alex Cross book was coming out, 'Violets Are Blue'. SO, now I am excited about continuing this read. The only problem I can see, is I will have to wait for the third addition to this trilogy. I hope the second book doesn't end three different times."
3,Pacified but not Satisfied,"I must agree with some of the others this book was a real page-turner. I could not put the book down, in fact I read the book in one day. However, in the middle of the book I found myself guessing who the ""Mastermind"" was before I got to the last chapter and I was right. It wasn't too difficult to figure out.I decided not to buy the sequel (Violets are Blue) because its hardcover and I refuse to pay that much money - not because I'm cheap but because I wasn't completely satisfied with Roses are Red.Once reading books like Kiss the Girls and Along came a Spider - a reader expects that same thrill and expense in other Alex Cross series."
2,You must be kidding!!,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book is highly disappointing, is transparent, easy to figure out, and gives us an ending that is simply a marketing ploy for the next book. Alex Cross whines and cries his way through more than 300 pages of poorly constructed action sequences, immature dialoque, and plain old boring scenes that we have seen over and over again.What happens to these authors, like Deaver, Pearson, and Cornwell, who write such excellent books and then along the way lose their energy, creativity and desire to deliver a decent product to their loyal readers. This drivel should be a the end of any list. If you must, wait till you can get it at the used book store."
5,Very Exciting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great book it has excellent suspense and great, great WHO IS IT? MARVEL!The mastermind is a mastermind, as due only to J. Patterson, who has a marvelous imagination! His technique is amazing and yet quit prfound. this is truly a great book. Read It."
2,Reads like an outline,"This was a fast paced, easy book to read, but I couldn't shake the feeling this was an outline or a Reader's Digest Condensed version of a much better book-- one that made sense. The identity of the psycho was so hard to understand!"
3,Entre to Next Book,"This book was obviously written to set up his next book. The story is slow and not as intense as his past books, but it was a good quick read."
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited to see a new book by James Patterson, whose books I have always enjoyed. This one was a disappointment to say the least. The writing was stilted, the plot old, and the ending was awful. I had to force myself to finish it, kept thinking it would get better. I think Mr. Patterson needs to take some time off, no need to be so quick to get another book out if this is the quality we can expect. I know he can do better."
1,Don't bother,"I have read other Patterson books and they were entertaining. This book though is frustrating that it depicts basically a superman criminal that can do anything. As you go through the book to find out who the criminal is Patterson let's you believe it is one person, and OK it isn't that person, so it is someone else, which is fine. But, then to finish the book with yet a third person being the Mastermind with no support, no reasons, no background; just a surprise ending is STUPID and FRUSTRATING. I had to read other reviews of the book to find out that the answers to this book might be in the next book.I will probably look at the next book to see if it does answers some of the questions in Roses are Red, but I will not buy it. I'll read it at a store or a library. I had spent enough time and money on this junk already."
4,GREAT ENDING,"Great ending, would have never guessed the MASTERMIND. Not as much action as some of his other Cross novels, but still worth it. The ending gets 3.5 stars.A sequel is a 9.999999 out of 10 possibility."
2,Not worth the time to read,"This is the first James Patterson book I have read so I can not compare it to his others and I am reluctant to read any of them at this point. I didn't mind the short chapters, but all of the chapters on his personal life seemed like filler to me. I kept waiting for something significant to happen there and nothing ever materialized. And the ending, I will not give it away but it is ridiculous. I like books that I can at least find a motivation for the crime but this book totally lacks one. I gave my copy to the library because I didn't want to give it to anyone I know after wasting my time reading it."
2,"synopsis, not a novel","This book reads like a synopsis or a book proposal. It's the Cliff Notes version. I appreciate a brisk pace, and Mr. Patterson certainly holds my attention, but there is almost no plot or character development, and the ending is a total cheat. There is no build-up to the big revelation at the end- it's just tacked-on, a big let-down. This is a good idea for a novel; add another 150 pages to flesh out the story and set up the ending, and there's a good book."
1,Roses are red,"I've never gotten the book as of yet, it was to be large print and not paper back, so it was return for the correct one. Still waiting and this has been a little over a month. Rebieanna Mitchell"
1,I am just thankful I did not pay for this trash!!,"My mom is a rabid fan of Patterson, and every time she finishes one of his books, she passes it on to me. Well, I have now read 3 and each time I have been disappointed. I have a bad habit of reading the last page of a novel before I am halfway done with it. Well, as those who have read this ""book"" will know, that is where he gives away the identity of Cross' nemesis, ""The Mastermind"". Did it help? No, I almost didn't finish the book because of it. Not only that, but there were NO clues telegraphed to the reader that this could possibly be the person responsible for the crimes. Come on, Mr. Patterson, we deserve better than that.I will say one positive thing: your habit of switching between 1st person singular and 3rd person singular was less grating this time because your protagonist was male. Please lay off writing from the 1st person singular if your protagonist is female - it doesn't ring true!"
1,First and last....,"There are many many worse authors selling just as many copies, however, this was an uninteresting novel, poorly structured, and with a pointless ending. There is no value in a detective story in which the author takes pains to ensure that the culprit cannot be identified. If the unfinished nature of the book is designed to tempt me to read the next in the series then it failed."
3,"always enjoyable, but predictable","what more can i say, if you like alex cross and you like the formula, you'll like this book; you probablly won't love it though (as i didn't) because it was a little less intense/driving than his other books."
2,"""Forgettable Alex Cross""","I got hooked on Alex Cross with Kiss the Girls, Along Came a Spider and the most spectacular of all, Step on a Crack. So, when I picked up Roses are Red, I expected the same page-turning suspense. To be honest, I can barely recall the plot in this forgettable book. I think that Roses Are Red is Patterson's attempt to re-create the successful, formulaic twist and turns of his previous Alex Cross books.... unfortunately, he is waaaay off the mark. Bank robbers are taking the managers families hostage as a way to crack the safes. Normally, once I start a James Patterson, a tornado could blow through my home and I wouldn't notice, however, I had to force myself to plod through this and make it through. A slow to start predictable plot that I hope I don't encounter again."
3,okay if you don't have anything else to read,"I really love James Patterson novels, however, this one hurts his longstanding image of a great writer. The plot was interesting, but I waited and waited and waited for it to escalate. Just when I thought the book was getting somewhere suspensful...back to idle. The drama was drawn out and weak and the romantic aspect was rediculous. The end seemed to run around in circles almost laughing at you for reading this book. The last few pages left me thinking, but not in a good way. I was left trying to figure out why Mr. Patterson decided on this exact ending. I enjoyed it while I was reading it but was left very disappointed. I guess I was expecting more of a thriller but instead got the beginning of a bad sequel."
3,OK but not great,"I am glad that Patterson is back to writing Cross novels. The last book of his I read was a re-do of an early work and it was awful. This is OK. I liked the part with Cross's daughter and the interchanges with Christine. However, unlike previous reviewers, I did not like the ending. It reminded me too much of another book he wrote."
3,Cheaply made saw. Not worth the money!,"The saw cuts good even though it is a refurb. Needed to put itall together but that was easy with the dirs.that came with it.The saw is made very [inexpensively]. Cutting table is to small for cutting big stuff, houseing is made from inexpensive white metal.I gave it 3 for the cutting. I was very surprised when I got this in the mail, because it is nothing but junk. I wont buy another shop tool from DELTA.The white metal houseing, just don't bang it with anything, and don't drop anything on the table since it is alu. I could have bought a Sears Craftmans and got a better product for a few dollars more.....Think I will go to Sears next time I need a power tool, but Delta will never see business from me again. Nothing but junk."
4,All that southern charm...,"I loved The Rock Orchard and had to read something else by P.S. (Paula) Wall. If I Were a Man, I'd Marry Me is a collection of short stories taken from a column she used to write (or still writes, not sure) that center on quirky southern characters and situations. She does the same here as she did in The Rock Orchard -- write some quirky, surrealistic takes of ordinary, every day people. Her wit is priceless in this collection and I enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed her novel. My favorite stories are ""Maxine's Diet,"" ""Faithful,"" ""The Mortician,"" ""Harley,"" ""Warming the Bench,"" ""Topless,"" ""The Ghost of Elvis,"" ""Chivalry,"" and ""Fruitcake."" I guess the one disappointing thing about this collection is that the stories are very short -- about three or four pages each. Other than that, I loved If I Were a Man, I'd Marry Me and I hope to read more stuff by this talented writer."
3,Picture Book,"I bought the book for reference in building a model of a late war Elco 80'. I was disappointed in what I got for my $40. It is indeed a picture book. It contains page after page of original construction drawings of dubious worth, and some photos I had not seen before. Looking though the credits I was struck with the thought that it appeared as though the author had just published everything he could get his hands on from the PT Boat Museum. Color profile plates (read original material) of camoflage measures are absent. There is not much here that is not available from other less expensive books, and a little research by the truly interested. The organization of the book left alittle to be desired as well. The chapter titles could used a little more thought. Overal it struck me as a make money quick endeavor by publishing a ton of material available through government sources. Very little original synthesis of the material was done. This volume is more like a scrapbook."
2,Not that great,I don't like it because it doesn't even shave as well as my normal razor. It was a waste of money!
1,Scratches,This thing is very scratchy. It left red lines all over my skin. Good thing it was discontinued.
3,women's wet dry shaver,"Pretty good shaver, easy to handle light weight, fair price, I'm satisfied w/ this product."
4,Great Ska Album,"This album showed both the range of the band and an extension of the ska format\sound. While better SKA can be found of Just Can't Stand It and from other Bristish bands like the Selectors this is still a very good album with some gems that didn't get air time. Would not be the first place to start, but would highly recommend all the Beats original studio albums for anyone looking to get deeper into ska. They had the best drun\bass combo of all the ska bands and IMHO they were the best of British ska period. Worth going beyond the Greatest Hits album. Get all the originals, you will not be disappointed."
4,Very good CD.. check out their others,"This was my second English Beat album, their third. I truly enjoyed this one and it has my favorite English Beat tune on it. I Just Can't Stop It is the best album they made, but I suggest you get all 3 of them."
2,Poor Visual Quality,"This concert was great however the visual quality of the DVD was not good. With all of the technology available these days, I expected a better picture quality. I also ordered The Whispers and the Frankie Beverly and Maze DVDs and was disappointed with the quality."
5,"Excellent, informational, and inspirational!!!","An amazing compilation of alternative techniques of dealing with epilepsy. This text gives people hope, and confidence, that they are totally capable of living a normal life."
3,Sorry - minus a star for each missing song,USED to be one of the greatest albums ever. Where are Tears of a Clown and Ranking Full Stop? Please re-release with the two missing songs! Will not purchase until they fix this.
5,GREAT GUIDE,I OWNED THIS GUIDE AS A KID - WAS ONE OF THE BEST YET - I WISH VERSUS STILL PUT THEM OUT FOR NEW GAMES - I STILL HAVE THE N64 LEGEND OF ZELDA VERISON IN MINT CONDITION - THAT I REFUSE TO PART WITH LOL
5,Jin CD.. is HISTORY IN THE MAKING,"What Jin is trying to do is not a easy task. He is trying to represent the Asian Culture in a community where we are basically an unknown. Jin's Cd certainly does this especially with the song ""Learn Chinese"" which embraces his Chinese Culture. The long wait for the CD is definitley worth the wait. Although I had to buy the CD through this website because for some reason or another, HMV Canada is not supplying the CD in their stores. A NOTE TO HMV CANADA....PLAESE START SUPPLYING THE CD....WE WILL BUY IT...and GIVE IT THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES."
1,I H.A.T.E clean versionz,"I waz goin 2 get a burnt copie of "" "" and he gav me a modaf*kin clean version.( PARENTAL ADVISORY IS SENSLESS )...peace out..."
2,lyrically he is the man but........,"Jin is one of the most talented dudes in the game but this album is not good. But then again, most cats that's going platinum now can't really mess with him but he's just not selling. i wouldn't say it's cause of him but the production for the most part is weak. the track he has with kanye is hot and styles helped the album but for the most part he has generic beats that don't match his lyrical style. i'm not hatin' on jin and hope for him to be around for years to come with better albums."
5,Solid album,"This album is solid. No fillers. Jins lyrics come strong, but his hooks arent too great. The track featuring swizz beats wasnt produced by swizz beats oddly enough, and wasnt that great. next time around I hope he can get better producers. And I agree, Love story shoudlve been his 2nd single, Its a smooth song, with a great hook and a angelic voice that sings the hook. this album is gonna firmly place him in the game."
5,shock,Item was as described and a very nice quality. It works great for the crazy roads over here in England they were much needed. Thanks
5,What can you say about the master?,This is classic Louis L'Amour - short stories that range from the old west to the shores of Asia featuring a strong hero (frequently accompanied with trustworthy companions) and a clearly defined villan. If you have never read this author - do so. For classic American fiction there simply isn't a better author.
3,It's Okay.,"The table is not 37"". Across the middle it is 36.5"". There's a slight curve along the sides to the corners. It measures 35"" x 35"" from corner to corner.Also, a couple of my table legs open to a poor angle to the floor (they don't hang straight) though I may be able to fix that if I try."
5,"well built, solid",I was surprised at how well built and solid this table is. The top is quite thick and with sturdy legs and strong hinges I expect this table to last a long time. It is especially stable.
2,A dive from a cliff off the heights of Elemental . . .,"Coming off the triumph of Elemental, this record is a dissapointment. Orzibol deciding to go for a concept album, (the first for TFF since The Hurting) was a bad move at this point, as he didn't seem to have all the songs together to make it work. A lot of it is just pointless dabbling, or just filler. On the opening track he tries to go progressive but doesn't have the melody to carry it. This CDs best songs, like `Me And My Big Ideas' (a self-parody by Orzibol on his idea of doing a concept album?) are not as good as the weakest tracks on Elemental (of which there are very few)."
2,"Almost A Duplicate Of Her 1999 ""White Christmas"" CD","I was extremely disappointed that this CD was almost a duplicate of her wonderful 1999 ""White Christmas"" CD with what appears to be only 4-5 of the SIXTEEN tracks actually new material.In the notes, she says ""This album was a joy to make."" Apparently the ""joy"" must've been as result of the clear ease in nearly recycling a CD done 8 years ago.Yes, the songs are beautiful--wonderful, classic songs of the season. Martina McBride at her best. For sheer musical artistry, it would rank 5 stars.But it is really sad, when so many artists are trying to create new and original material, that McBride slides in old stuff under new packaging like this."
3,Beautiful but disappointing!,"I love Martina, but not this album. I gave it three stars because an album with 16 tracks on it is great and her voice is too lovely for words. However, the songs are all standard--she does not add the powerful tone of her voice to these lyrics. She does not ""own"" the songs and make them hers; therefore the effort becomes very bland. Only buy this if you must own all of her cds; otherwise, listen to Burl Ives and all the others who have really mastered these tunes."
5,martina's enthusiasm covers this genre extremely well.,"I was reluctant to purchase another Christmas album but I had recently become a fan, after purchasing Evolution, with the beautiful song, Valentine. My enthusiasm was greatly increased when I watched the White House Christmas Show. Her rendition of ""The Christmas Song"" was beautiful.I waited patiently for her to perform and I was not dissapointed. I am now a loyal fan, forever."
1,"Great Songs, But just a re-release!","These are great songs, but I purchased the album thinking this was a new Christmas CD by Martina. It is not! It is just a re-release of her 1999 White Christmas album with 4 additional tracks. Come on people! Give us something new that we haven't already bought! I want my money back!"
2,Overpowers the Songs,"Martina McBride can be said to have a ""great"" voice, but I find her renditions of these Christmas songs to be obnoxious. Why do you need to practically scream the notion of ""having a merry little Christmas?"" I know she is trying to show off her voice, but it is a very un-artistic way of treating Christmas songs. There is no hint of true emotion behind any of these songs. Did she actually think about the words she was singing? The answer is - no."
3,chuck palahniuk,"this book also contains an essay by chuck palahniuk haven't read it yet, just thought you should know"
2,Dancing almost impssible,I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn't get past it don't waste your time or patience with this annoying game.
1,"Too hard, don't buy","At the first it was so fun, but then when I got to the dancing part, I asked my mom and dad to do it, but they couldn't do it. So I just had to do it myself, but I couldn't, and then one day my daddy beat that part. Then he beat the other dancing part, and when i finally got to the giant eel, I beat the crap out of it in peace and harmony. But, the dancing parts were so hard, please don't remember em. If you have this game, you may like the dancing part, but I think it's a piece of junk.Justin 5 1/2 years(typed by mom)Mom's note- This is a terrible game. Buy Shrek 2 instead. The dancing parts were so hard that neither me or my husband could get the necessary 75% accuracy to advance. It is not fun. DON""T BUY THIS!!!"
1,The Greatest Inspiration,Michael Bolton's music heals the hearts of many.It touches our lives in so many different ways.The titles are a great source of joy and inspiration.Long live Michael my dreams come true through your music.
1,Leave the classics alone,"Perhaps Michael Bolton is singing these songs out of a true love for them. Or maybe he's just a leech trying to make a lot of cash.Either way, the end result is bad. The only person that can do justice to ""Georgia On My Mind"" is Ray Charles. The best version of ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" is still Percy Sledge's. And I never was a fan of ""Dock Of The Bay,"" but after hearing Bolton's version of it, the original version by Otis Redding sounds magnificent.I would imagine that some younger fans have listened to Bolton's ""Georgia On My Mind"" and have thought that he originated the song, and have never heard the true classics. And boy, that's a shame. There are some things that just should not be remade."
1,Mr.SoulLess,what greatest hits? upset stomach variety? he can't sing.i wish he would stop trying to tarnish R-N-B music.doing dock of the bay? you have to be kidding? Bolton is a okay writer.but that straining gives me a headache.that's not Soul that's toneless for a whole Decade.
1,THE JURY IS BACK!,"A couple of months ago, a jury was right on the money with their finding that Bolton unconscionably copied the Isley Brothers in his ""creation"" ""Love is a Beautiful Thing"". This CD (like all of his others) makes clear that Bolton has shamelessly tried to copy a style of music, standards, melodies, and claim it for his own. But it becomes painfully obvious after about ten seconds listening that he cannot.Every dime he ever gets close to for this drivel should go to musicians from as far back as some forty years ago from whom he stole.Want to hear this music actually performed the way it is supposed to be played and sung? Purchase some Ray Charles, some Otis Redding, Al Green, Soloman Burke or Percy Sledge.Shamelessly derivative"
1,Where Are the Ladies,"Once again it seems another jazz books of regurgitated titdbits has forgotten most of the woman in jazz. True Ella, Sarah, Billie, Carmen and the likes are here -- but for the most part this is a good ol' boys jazz review book. Was also VERY disappointed to note that their selected discography hasn't changed much since the last edition"
1,"Oldie, But Not So Goodie","Let me begin by saying I love old movies. Thelma Todd I know from her movies with Zasu Pitts and Laurel and Hardy. A fine comedian and actress. Unfortunately this copy of this movie is terrible.I have other movies distributed by Alpha Home Entertainment. Most are far better and at least acceptable. However, this version of Klondike is badly focused throughout the entire film. Dialogue is virtually inaudible. I can't believe this was the quality of the original film so it must have been a badly denegrated version used by Alpha. Alpha did their customers a dis-service by issuing this copy.On the dvd case are these words ""Due to the age and rarity of this print, some picture and sound anomalies are present"". This is a huge understatement. Don't give up on Alpha Home Entertainment, but save your money and take a pass on this copy of this movie. It is an oldie, but not a goodie."
2,I wish I had read up on the story behind the toys first,"My 7 year old loves his Bionicles especially this set because it was challenging to put together. But If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have let my son have these toys just because I disagree with the movie and stories behind the toys. And also how expensive it is to collect all the pieces. The series doesn't end, there is continually more and more bionicles to collect. I let my son have the Bioncles because to me they look like challenging lego robot sets to put together and some of his cousins had them. But if I had read the stories and the info presented in the movies first he wouldn't of had any of them. And I wouldn't have let him get hooked on them and wanting the rest of this endless series."
4,"Difficult, but worth the effort","Yes, this was more difficult than it should have been to put together. I bought it for my 6-yr old who is interested in anatomy and the human body. But my 13-yr old and I ended up putting it together. It took us about an hour, but it was an hour of quality time together, discussing science, and anatomy. How often does that happen with a teenage girl? Anyway, when it was complete, it was really amazing to look at. We also had the brain, the heart and the torso. Once my 6-yr old could see it together, she was able to do it with a little help (some of the pieces are hard to clip together - kind of like putting back together a broken egg). I highly recommend this for a family activity."
4,Does it's job and holds you in!,"Just bought this for my wedding dress and I really like it. Be careful when ordering this product because it really does run small. I wear a 32B and have to hold my breath to put it on. The boning is on the side so it is not visible in the dress. It does, however, have foam in the belly area which can be visible if you sit down and it scrunches. Because of this the bottom of the bustier actually shows through the dress. Other than that it has a low back and never slips. Once you get it on, it won't slide anywhere! Definitely a push up and makes the twins look great!"
4,Supportive,"The bra is very supportive and held me in quite nicely. It also smoothed my tummy just a bit, which is all I needed. It has minimal boning, so I figured it would be very comfortable under my wedding dress. It was, until the end of the night. The boning is located down the two side seams on the bra. It helped the bra stay up, however the last hour of the wedding, I noticed some pain at two spots on my hips. When I got back to the room and took the bra off, I noticed a small sore on each side of my hip where the boning rested. Overall, it was a good bra and I'd recommend it. Honestly, few long line bras stay completely comfortable all night, so this one wasn't bad at all."
4,A peaceful universe?,"The Damned trilogy was quite an entertaining romp despite the ludicrous premise of humans being the only intellligent being up for some violence. But as long as you accept that the books are quite good. I particularly liked how the dumbest of the alien races actually understood what was at stake and tried to do something about it in this final installment, which is by the way the best of the three. Overall the trilogy wanders a bit, though. Alan Dean Foster is an excellent author and one of my absolute favourites but he does occasionally end his books with a puff rather than a bang. This one was somewhere in between the two extremes. Still, The Damned trilogy is well worth a read. Most of Foster's novels are quite entertaining despite occasional weaknesses in plot and endings. For some more traditional Foster I highly recomend ""Midworld"", ""Sentenced to Prism"" and The Icerigger trilogy. Bon appetit!"
2,Aluminum Inferior to Copper,"This is stranded aluminum wire. Aluminum is 1.58 times more restive than copper. Thus a 1/0 AWG aluminum wire is approximately equivalent to a 2 AWG copper wire. This may make a world of difference in your application!Additionally, others have stated this wire appeared to be less than 1/0 AWG. I measured the core diameter with my caliper and it appeared almost exactly .325 inch (1/0 AWG) (it's always tough measuring stranded accurately). So at least you know the product's labeled gauge is correct.Do a quick search for ""aluminum vs copper conductivity"" for more properties of aluminum vs copper wires to see if this suits your application."
2,Forgettable short film,"I saw this last night and think I should review it before I completely forget about it. This film apparently started out as a short film about two people eating lunch in a restaurant and has been expanded into feature length. Fairly interesting characters in search of a plot. If your idea of drama is watching a woman try to convince her brother to go to church then you will probably enjoy this movie, but that's about as dramatic as this movie gets. I got the impression that the writer/director has not lived a particularly interesting life. I do think it is a good thing that boring people have the opportunity to make boring movies; someday soon maybe we will all have a movie out on DVD, and from those millions of efforts perhaps one or two good works of art will emerge.That being said, this film is much much better than Gladiator."
1,THE BEST THAT HOLLYWEIRD CAN PRODUCE,"This movie is a movie about 30 year olds with a three year old mentality. I take that back. Theyare amoeba, moving about seeking pleasure, food and sex. This they do with all the morality,conscience and scruples of single celled organisms. And it's about as interesting as watchingpond water. Ah, but everyone says it's great. What does that tell you about today's critics andaudience? My only guess why is that their lives are so meaningless that a movie like this salvestheir sense of self (do amoeba have a sense of self?) See you in the pond."
1,You Can Count On Me Not to Recommend This,"A disjointed, unhappy, dark tale that moves with jerky indecision, and bizarre background music, to a anti-climax. Was the eternally greasy never-do-well bro any more sympathetic than the eternally perky, enabling, overprotective sis? My advice: don't worry about it."
5,a fabulous character piece,"How to start this review, other than to say that this film is arguably the most well-acted and well-scripted film of the past year. While the story is pure TV-movie-of-the-week territory, Lonergan's funny, truthful script, and the mesmeric performances of Linney, Ruffalo, and Broderick elevate this film way above standard character-driven fare. This was one of those movies that reminds you of how pleasureable it is to watch quality film-making and acting. If this is the standard of Lonergan's work, I can only look forward with baited breath to his next project. Outstanding."
4,Solid,"A bit sentimental, but ""You Can Count on Me""'s lack of convention is appealing. This is definitely no formula fiction. The soundtrack is also amazing, although it doesn't always jive with the mood and pace of the film. I think the performances from everyone were superb, and for me, Kenneth Lonergan's pursuit of genuine realism falls a little flat sometimes. Some scenes with Matthew Broderick felt contrived and unnecessarily funny. Otherwise a solid emotional film, one I recommend happily."
3,Don't buy this book..there's a better choice!,"I have just returned from viewing a special exhibition of Mucha's works. Some were the usual ones, many were rare. It gave me a good feel for the overall output of Mr. Mucha. I bought this book at the exhibit, mostly to help the museum. When I got it home I compared it to a FAR SUPERIOR Mucha book called Mucha by Sarah Mucha, which is a hardcover (unlike this book). There is NO COMPARISON for value and breadth and depth of the collections of images and the biographical information. See my review of Mucha by Sarah Mucha for more details. The colors in the present book are captured well. But the book by Ulmer is about 3"" shorter and about 2"" less wide than the Sarah Mucha book, so even the well photographed images are small. It doesn't show the breadth of Mucha's work, like his photographs. For just a bit more money I suggest you go with the Mucha by Sarah Mucha book. I don't think you will be disappointed."
3,Hemingway's goofs,If these were by any other author they would never have seen the light of day. 85% of them are trash. Book is not worth the money.
2,Too hard,"I was looking forward to driving a bunch of Alfa Romeos around some good tracks. And in the game you get to do that, but because the steering in this game is so bad, using a controller or wheel, it makes the game not much fun. While it could be argued that the steering too accurately represents Alfa's, that is not the case. I drive an Alfa almost every day and this game is not representative of that experience. But, if you are into Alfa's, I can understand how you must have it anyway."
5,Other wordly,"Best album of the year. The songs have an ethereal, dreamlike quality, while at the same time being catchy and upbeat. This is something most artists never achieve."
4,Rock On,"I was pretty new to Christian rock the first time I listened to this album. I'd heard some of Petra's earlier stuff on the radio and liked it, but now I'm hooked. I like all kinds of Chistian music, but there are times when you just have to turn it up REALLY loud! Check it out if you're a closet hard-rock fan...you won't be disappointed."
3,Go elsewhere for your first Petra album,"There are far better Petra albums out there than this one. They definitely started to decline in popularity beginning with this album, and it's noticeable with the sound on the album. The first half is pretty good, but the second half turns into a more-of-the-same every-song-runs-together feel. If you're wanting Petra with John Schlitt on lead vocals, try Beyond Belief or This Means War!"
5,No Doubt about it...,"Our entire family loves this album...from our 7, 8, and 10 year old daughters on up to mom and dad. Tho I'll admit I have to be in the mood for the faster music - like when I'm drivin - <G> the depth to the lyrics this group puts out is absolutely incredible. This is definately music with a message."
2,Dreck,"Uninspired from the awful album cover to the ho-hum playing and production. If this band is connected to the Creator, then where is the creative ""spark"" -- one bland song after the other."
5,very smooth bits,"I have used these bits for several projects around my house. Most notably, I used them to build some bookcases. There was absolutely no wandering when I drilled the holes for the shelf mounts. The holes were nice and clean and the bits chewed through the work piece with ease."
2,A pretty convoluted take on the Arthurian legend,This book took a pretty convoluted look at this well examined legend and added someinteresting if odd takes of it's own. I personally felt it was very choppy. Reviewingthe Nordic Gods before reading might be helpful. Doesn't have anything on Marion Zimmer Bradley.
1,I thought Kong was tough!,Don't waste your money! I have had other Red Kong toys in the past and I thought the Black was supposed to be EXTREME! Nope. It lasted about 5 minutes. Very disappointed.
3,Only 'chews' when it's filled with frozen PB,My 9 month old lab/jack russel terrier mix is a powerful chewer and a lot of energy.Cons:- She only touches it when I fill both ends with frozen peanut butter. She spends about 30 mins or so licking out the peanut butter. She'll gnaw on it for a little longer and then she'll move on.- It's too heavy for her to throw around and it usually just sits there until I fill it back up. Maybe it doesn't taste good (but somehow all the plastic sprinklers taste better??)Positives:- it's really held up. It shows barely any sign of wear or tear- it's reallly easy to clean; I can just run it under some cold water and it's clean.
3,Could be far better !,"Basically its a very heavy duty bone made of hardened plastic that will give most dogs who it chew quite a challenge and they will chew on it endlessly. This is of course is supposed to keep your dog busy instead of chewing on your furniture or your kids toys /sneakers etc.It does that ok I guess. However what don't understand is it has two hollow inserts to put food it that will keep your dog busy ( in theory ) .Problem is that the inserts are far too shallow and your dog will get food out at a pretty god rate rendering it within a few minutes to a determined dog just another bone, albeit now an expensive bone. Clueless designers who ALMOST had something here ."
1,Dog has destroyed,"My lab has chewed pieces off this and I have had to throw it out. Apparently, not extreme enough for him."
1,"My dog broke the bone in 2 seconds,to expensive ,it should stay longer. I have a pit bull.","My dog broke the bone in 2 seconds,to expensive ,it should stay longer. I have a pit bull.may be for a small dog it is ok."
3,Fido not thrilled,"Bought this black Kong because it is stronger than basic Red. However less flexible cuts down on fun. Dog gets bored quickly and leaves it. Also hard to find treats that fit, so not used much. As with all kongs very durable especially if dog isnt interested."
2,Fun for 2 hours,"I ordered this bone thinking it would last for more than other toys for my dog. I have a 50 pound pit bull terrier, which is a chewer. She liked the bone and likes to play, but had it in peices in a matter of 2 hours. If this is extreme, my dog must be out-of-this-world. I'm not very happy with the product, a waste of 8 bucks. I will stick to their Kong Balls in the future."
3,"Good, but not good enough","I was hoping that this extreme kong toy would offer some lasting entertainment to our two dogs. Unfortunately, this toy lasted only 3-4 hours after our dogs began chewing on it. We have a bassett hound and a bernese/rott mix, both of which should be product testers in our family's opinion. I do have another extreme kong toy which has lasted for a lengthy amount of time; and, was hoping to find at least one more of a different type for both dogs to share. The bassett hound had chewed the end of this toy off in just a few hours, so off to the trash it went; and, on goes the search for another suitable toy. Keep trying Kong, you're getting there with the ""extreme"" line; but, still have a bit further to go."
3,"Dogs loved it, but broke on first day","Our 70lb lab mix took to this toy immediately. He didn't mind the strong, rubber odor (when you glob the holes with peanut butter it sure helps).He carried this thing around with him everywhere! However, after about 3 hours of constant play, this thing has started to deteriorate. The holes have been chewed off, and the center of the bone shows signs that it could snap soon.I would recommend this if you plan to constantly shove treats in it.I would not recommend this if you plan to use this as a chew toy. It did not stand up to our dog! The original red Kong has lasted us 3 months and is still going strong."
1,High Hopes,"Toys usually only last a matter of minutes with my 9 m.o. lab mix, and unfortunately this was no different. Literally one minute after I handed it to him, he had already eaten one of the ends off. :( We've had much better luck with our squirrel dude, so far it's the only treat dispensing toy that he hasn't completely destroyed."
1,Do not buy for powerful chewers/puppy,"Just paid 3600$ to have a big chunk of this indestructable toy removed from my pups intestine. Would not buy this, not safe"
1,lasted about 30 seconds,most items in the KONG brand hold up quite well. dog bit this one in two pieces with one bite...and proceeded to whittle down the rest within a minute. dont bother buying this item.
2,Kong Extreme Dog bone not for chewers,"The kong extreme are supposed to be indestructible! However, do not buy this product if you have a dog that is a chewer. We have two labs and they opened these up on Christmas and had the hard rubber shredded all over my living room in 10 minutes. They are supposed to be made to chew, but don't waste your money!"
3,It can be destroyed - in 30 minutes,"I have never seen my 12 month old lab mix love a toy without ""flavor"" more than this one. He loved it a little too much, though, and managed to take a bite out of one end within 30 minutes. Big price to pay, but for those dogs with weaker jaws and teeth, it might be hours, days or weeks of fun."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews I purchased 2 of these for our 2 labs. At the time I placed the order there was no size listed. I received the bones today and it took my dogs about 5 minutes to tear up the ends of the bones and start trying to eat small chunks of rubber (I had to take the bones away so they would not choke on the pieces they were chewing off) I was glad to see when I went back and checked the product description that the size (medium) was now added to the description, hopefully this will help others avoid the mistake I made. On the plus side, the dogs did love them while they lasted."
1,Very Poor,As I have stated for the other Kong Rubber Toys they are very over rated. I feel that they are dangerous since the dog can chew them up so easly and ingest all that rubber.
1,Strong smell of rubber!!,"These toys have a very strong smell of rubber, my dog won't have a thing to do with them. I'm going to try and send them back. Very disappointed!"
1,Wrong zone,This movie is for Zone 4. It will not play in Michigan which is zone 1. I need to return it.I received an e-mail from the company and they are going to send another one. Let's hope this one works.
2,Too much focus on bad behavior.,"Starting out each page with THIS IS MINE, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT! is most definitely NOT something I'd like to read or reinforce with my toddler who already has behavioral problems in this area. The tone is negative and the solutions are not sharing, but offering distraction, which is not the direction we'd like to take. This book will be donated because it's completely missing the point."
2,My favorite holiday CD,"I got this album at a Hallmark store in the 80s when they were selling cassettes of Christmas music at the checkout at Christmas time. I didn't know Sandi Patty at the time, but liked the selection of songs, so I bought it. It quickly became a favorite -- my children grew up with this music. When cassettes gave way to CDs, I bought the CD. Now I have it downloaded on my iPod. After almost 30 years, I still am brought to tears when I hear Sandi Patty sing O Holy Night. I have shared this with many friends, my entire family, two husbands, and four children. This is a classic by one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Enjoy it!"
4,I read it at least 10 times already.,"I really enjoy this book. As a matter of fact, I read at least once every year since I got it. I'm still trying to find the second book for this story. If you got it, please e-mail me!"
5,Plain Dealing,"Basically this is a good old-fashioned whodunnit, with an amateur female sleuth first person narrator, told in the past historic tense, with no post-modernist gimmicks, or interpolated voice of the killer, or confusing flashbacks. In spite of that it's brilliantly original with sharp satire and social observation. The setting is an Ohio town newspaper (evidence suggests the Cleveland Plain Dealer). A local television evangelist has been poisoned by lily-of-the-valley decoction and the lover of a rival minister has made a false confession. An eager young reporter enlists the help of a grumpy old librarian to track down the real killer."
5,chemist's view,It is a wonderful scientific full illustarated book which contains all formulations and procedure to prepare most of the cosmotics used daily in our life.
1,You must be kidding,"I cannot believe that anyone with more than a third grade education thinks the earth is 6,000 years old. If the creationists want people to stop laughing at them, perhaps they should learn some basic science."
5,Great pad,"This pad is great, it has a nice bounce sound is nice and quiet and portable. First off dont buy this as your first pad its too small. I recommend investing in a heavy hitter pad like the stock pad. This pad is a little bigger than the palm of your hand so its preety small but it still works. Its great if you cant fit a foot long pad in something or bring it somewhere but it is really cool. overall nice small little pad get it second or eaven third its not great for starters as you dont get the full feel of how big the drum is"
3,Runs extremely small,"While the shoes appeared to be of good quality, I had to return due to sizing. My daughter normally wears a size 2.5-3 in shoes, so I ordered a 4 to ensure they would last a few months. They were way too small. I would suggest ordering several sizes larger than the child's normal shoe size."
3,Subject Matter Not What I Expected,"I sent this book to a friend of mine whose friends are starting the journey towards motherhood, thinking it would be useful over the next few years. While it seems that the book contains lots of helpful hints and information, readers should be aware that there are also many religious overtones in the book. The author repeatedly praises and refers to God and offers religious quotes/stories. I was a little surprised to see this in a book about baby showers, especially there is not indication from the book's description that there is such a religious slant. Regardless, seems like a helpful guide."
2,Not for everyone,"This book is certainly not for everyone. The basic party how to's were very basic-nothing new. The recipes are hardly ""international""-unless you are someone unfamiliar with salsa. There are a lot of games, but again, nothing new. just your basic count the jelly beans kind of things. There's a weird section with a bunch of poems written by baby and the last chapter tells you how to get salvation through jesus christ."
4,What a deal!,Over 7 hours of classic Brubeck for only six bucks. Only a few recordings are poor only because they were recorded live in the early '50s. This definitely satisfies my jazz low level warning light.
2,Is a CD set actually available?,"While this is a great selection of tracks, the current Amazon ""Also available in CD Format"" link on the product page leads to the Amazon Brubeck ""25th Anniversary Reunion [Live] CD"" page - Is this actually also available in a CD set format, or only in the lower quality MP3 format (henceforth the lower rating)?"
1,Dark Fall 2:Lights Out is a bore,"I played the original Dark Fall several years ago and enjoyed it. I thought the sequel, being new and modern, would be an improvement on the original. I was wrong. Dark Fall 2:Lights Out was boring and difficult from beginning to end. I finished the game only because I hate leaving loose ends behind. I forced myself to finish it, and said a big THANK YOU when the credits rolled so that I could uninstall it from my computer.It was a very tedious game which jumps through ages from stone age to future. On the surface, that sounds interesting, but in reality, it was difficult and nonsensical."
4,1983 Christmas Album,"Sandi's first Christmas album is chock full of fun with the upbeat ""Come, Let Us Worship the King"" and ""O Magnify the Lord,"" several medleys and the great anthem, ""Bethlehem Morning.""Yuletide Joy"
3,Content is wonderful though textual citations are sparse,"Although not a philosopher but rather a management professor, I found this introduction to ancient wisdom and folly to be written with a wonderful knack for including illuminating details. Reading this with a particular interest in business ethics, I found many helpful things but citation of original sources in the text was often too sparse to properly direct me to the literature on topics that especially engaged me. Visit the book author's site for an e-version of this book: http://www.san.beck.org/index.html#6 ."
2,disappointed,"I read the reviews for this book and even selected it for my first book club meeting. It was very disappointing. The characters were all equally developed, there was none that stood out to which I could identify and often the descriptions were just plain boring. Characters seemed stereotypical and the pages describing them were often only two pages before they were killed. It got to the point where I just skipped ahead because what is the point of reading a cliche description of a stereotyped character, that you don't develop any feelings for, only to have them leave the plot two pages later. Technically, I thought the reading level was very low- tenth grade. The alternate reality was mildly interesting, but nothing particularly clever or page-turning. I'm sorry to say that I disliked the book enough to spend the time reviewing it so that others might not waste their time if they are looking for something with any depth at all."
1,ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT,"THE FILM BY ITSELF IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, THE COPY IS OK THE PACKAGING IS CRAPPY, WHY WASN;T IT PUT IN A DVD BOOK CASE?I AM THINKING OF RETURNING. F.L."
2,"Helpful, Sometimes","Tab books have their place. Unfortunately, much of the time they are either flat-out wrong or the tabs themselves, while correct-sounding, are impossible or near-impossible to play.What would be nice is if, instead of a ridiculous attempt to tab the songs ""exactly how the album sounds,"" which is pointless because you lose that little pipe dream early on by the simple necessity of having to downsize multiple layers of guitar tracks into 2-4, the tab book writers instead presented tab books that were the best way to play the songs live.Aaron Stang does not do this, and as a result the Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness tab book is only marginally helpful."
1,It just didn't work,"I bought this product for Christmas and had a lot of expectations. I have to say that it does look well. However on the second date it just stopped working. I wind it several times and it started again. However few hours later it stopped again. And I was wearing it all the time. The same happens in 3-4 consecutive days. Finally I have decided to return this item. I was very, very disappointed!!!"
1,Did not work,"This dvi adapter could detect my other monitor, but did not work. i troubleshooted for days trying to figure out what was wrong.Had this adapter been better quality, it could have saved me countless hours of driving myself crazy thinking that it was a software problem.Do yourself a favor and buy a better quality adapter and dont be so cheap, like i was."
1,Item did not work - returned,I bought this to convert from a DVI input to VGA. Item would not work - the computer wouldn't recognize any signals from the cable once the adapter was connected. Wasn't a cable issue as I tried the cable without the adapter on a DVI input with no issues. I am considering just trashing the item as this seller doesn't pay for returns on defective items and it will cost me as much to return it than the item did itself.
2,"Good introduction to the Celts, but ...","This is a well-illustrated book and a good introduction to Celtic history - but an atlas it is not! The maps are really poor, neither particularly informative nor attractive to look at. One would have expected much better of Philips, and the author must be disappointed in them."
3,"Right Product, Wrong Cover","I ordered this book for a friend for a class that we are taking. When I received the book but I was a little worried because the cover that was advertised was not the cover on the book, but after looking through it, it was the correct book, I just felt a little uneasy about it at first."
1,Stay away from kind of TRASH like this,"It's totally bulls*** hard plastic case that worthy only $0.01You can never take it off once the phone wearsTried lots of ways carefully to move away and failed, finally it's broken after I take out the phoneWill NEVER NEVER NEVER spend even 1c to the stuff"
3,cigarettes & old lady perfume,"There I was all dressed up with my husband and there he was sniffing me....""why do you smell smoky? Where have you been??"" I sniffed my jacket and asked myself the same question.. when was I last in the company of a smoker? Later he said ""I keep getting these whiffs of smoke from you.""The next day I went to apply Ojon oil to my fine, dry hair for the second time, this time a little heavier handed because I wanted to use it as a treatment. That's when the smell hit, hard: An old lady smoker covering it up with perfume. I would have laughed if it had'nt cost so much.Well, I've discovered this: if I apply it extremely lightly (as they say, the size of a grain of rice), it smells slightly more perfumey than smoky. I am hoping it will eventually make my hair smooth, so it may be worth it. Wish I had gotten a trial size first, instead of this big jar.Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment"
2,Boo!,"It smells absolutely wonderful! But, I couldn't get a comb through my hair after using it to save my life! So, it's basically hair perfume."
4,Very helpful,"This DVD is very helpful to me as I learn more about my son's sensory/regulatory issues. I've purchased and learned from many books on this subject, and many contain great information, but reading about a physical activity like OT is not the best way to understand it. Having an experienced OT demonstrate (and explain) various activities has been incredibly useful.Initially, the DVD helped me understand my son's experience better and try a few things while I waited for a slot in an OT clinic. Now that we are working with an OT, I still refer to the DVD. Our OT spends most of her time working with my son, rather than educating me...being able to refer to this DVD has been enormously helpful. I'm really excited about any tool that can help me support my son's growth...and this DVD does just that!"
5,Move over Bryson,"I rarely buy into the ""so good you can't put it down"" rhetoric when talking about books to read. Stephanie Griest's Around the Bloc is an exception. Reminiscent of my favorite, Bill Bryson, she has an amazing combination of detail, brilliant humor, and historical research that both teaches and entertains. This is a book that can profoundly change the way young people look at foreign travel or foreign study. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to study abroad as a guidebook for how to truly capture the essense of cultural immersion. Griest's re-discovery of her own culture through learning about others is an inspiring gem of a lesson."
4,This Book is Such a Pleasure.,"This book energized me. Reading this book was almost as fun as traveling. I can't wait to visit Cuba. But this story is not just about travel. It's also about identity, family, language, and everything else important. Every traveller and every young woman must read this book. Keep your eye on this author! She's going to make it big. She's going to show us the world with fresh eyes."
2,Older Product,I ordered two of these since I have about 4 battery units. They have to be replace constantly making it a not so good product. The banding on one has come off already after a month. Must have been stocked for a while?
1,Forgot one rule....,"Never read it, heard her on Howard Stern and I was laughing at all the rules she says not to do. My question is what about the book? She left out rule number 1: do not buy the book to have your spouse see it. that would be a tell tell sign, would it not?There goes her marketing, maybe that is why she was on the radio."
2,Disappointed - but not entirely useless,"Regardless of wrong or right, this books assumes the idea that you've decided to have an affair and are therefore needing advice on how and where to select your future affair parnter. My husband and I purchased this book with hope that it might guide us through how to overcome the post infidelity after math. We thought that the title ""The 50 Mile-Rule"" referred to the distance that you need to keep from your former affair partner for safety.Instead the book is a tactical approach to having affairs so that in the event you get caught the damage will be minimal. Although the book didn't give any aid on how to heal it did help us understand the logistics of the impact of the fall out based on how closely your social, religious, or geographical community is to the affair partner.Although the contents weren't what I hoped; in terms of writing style and organization the book is well done."
2,Too ...typical,"This book assumes that every mistress wants to ditch her life and marry/have lots of babies with her married boyfriend. If you think that's a problem, there is advice on how to control that - but mostly it's just common sense. I'd say this book is a waste of time unless you are looking for something along the lines of ""Cheating for Dummies."" (Dummies being the operative word)."
1,The Cultural Decline of America,"What better evidence could one offer of the cultural decline in America than this book? A sociopath is defined as one with an extreme mental disorder marked by unusual egocentric and antisocial activity; one that cannot appreciate the harm they perform on society. Not only does Ms. Brandt offer advice about how to successfully cheat on your spouse, but she proudly offers that much of her advice was gathered when she was the ""other woman"" in an affair.Ms. Brandt's advice to society is to do it if you can. Unfortunately, such narcissistic, self-indulgent behavior is the root of some of the most vicious behavior in our society. This book is a disgrace."
5,My kids love it!,"My daughter received one as a birthday gift and my boys would fight over it, so I had to order additional ones for the family. They love coming up with goals for their allowance and enjoy watching their money grow in each of the four chambers! What a great way to teach them about money!"
4,Coffee - the Healthy Way,"My 86 year old mother-in-law came to live with us 2 months ago. She was very ill and needed to gain weight fast. We tried every drink we could find, but Ensure Coffee Latte was the only one she liked. I like it too, but am trying to lose weight so I only get to drink one once in a while. It is hard to find in the stores, so we always buy it online. Great Drink, and it has helped Mom get well! Thank you Ensure."
4,Fun but Lacking,"Pretty cool, the world could use some more cyber punk epics like this one. The english dub's pretty good but I recommend listening to it in japanese at least once later on, it's just better that way man!My sole complaint for the series is the lack of action. The fight scene on the first disc ""Genesis"" kicks extreme robotic keester, but it never follows up with more. Not to the same degree anyway. This would be everyone's favorite dvd set if they had just made the fight scenes a little more interesting.It's a fun series anyway, with likeable characters and an exciting concept... though I wonder if the original is better...? (This is a remake of an older, eight episode series named Bubblegum Crisis)"
5,very uplifiting and soothing,"This cd is one of my favorites. It is a great cd to put on after church on Sundays (anyday). I love listening when I get ready for my day. Ray has a wonderful voice and I would reccommend to anyone who loves Christian Music. I recently lost my cd, so I have put it on my wish list for my spouse to purchase for me."
5,The Very Best CD of Christian Music,"I was shocked that no one had reviewed this GREAT cd. Many cds have a few moving songs and the rest are ok. This CD is different. Almost every song, if not every song, will move you. This is great music, with passion, and storytelling, and transporting the listener to the time and place of what's going on in the song. This music reaches the soul. It reaches where we live and the words remain with you. This music makes you long to be in Jesus' presence and this cd makes one feel His presence more. The 1st song-The Anchor Holds- is worth the price of the cd. The music and the words are beautiful. This is definitely a classic in Christian music. I really can't say enough good comments about this cd and I believe it will bless anyone who listens."
4,Very Inspirational....,"I bought this CD a pretty good while because I am very involved in sign language and I needed a song that would speak to the people that witnessed me signing, and I picked the anchor holds. The words are a picture that shows ,to me, that God is always there to povide Himself as a ""anchor"" through all of your ""storms"". It is very inspiration and I recomend this CD and any other that Ray has produced (I have them all almost) because it is a great witnessing tool."
5,Ray Boltz' Finest Performance!!,"The Concert Of A Lifetime is exactly that for Ray Boltz! This contemporary Christian performer brings his faith to each and every song in the concert! His inspiring lyrics move you as you hear ""The Anchor Holds"", or his most famous song ""I Pledge Allegiance To The Lamb"". Butyou will be truly touched by such songs as ""What If I Give All?"" andbrought to your knees in spirit filled praise as you hear ""Watch The Lamb"". This is truly ""The Concert Of A Lifetime"" and besides owning this great CD, I had the immense pleasure of seeing Ray Boltz LIVE as he brought this performance on tour throughout the United States. Many were saved that night, and I'm sure many more will be simply by hearing this music and its inspired words!"
2,hmm,"Having never seen the series before (except discs 1-2, eps 1-8), I must say that this is the poorest of the series. Despite having new DVD menu intervals and improved chapter selection, the series suffers from the momentary silliness that is common with a few of the episodes in NGE. Despite this, you have to watch this disc in order to progress with the story, and I'm told that the last episodes of the series are excellent."
5,im in love,"personally for me, anything under the naked music label is a beautiful experience but blue six's beautiful tomorrow simply blew me away....and i'm in love. if you're looking for really good sexy, chilled house music..beautiful tomorrow is it.... Listening to it is just like a new religious discovery that make you want to dabble more into it....slowly....coz it ain't heavy..it's just beautiful.."
5,GET IT NOW!,"If u like to chill out to music that's not too intense but not too soft, this is the cd for u. It's dance music but it lacks the intensity that a usual dance cd has. It's very soft and chill. A great cd to say the least."
4,Naked Music Does It Again!,"I think Naked Music is a highly innovative dance label that's released some killer compilations of mature, sophisticated house music. The stellar debut of Blue Six is a traffic-stopping collection of house music that's more concerned about songwriting and skillful production than beats and rhythm. Offering the right balance of style and substance, ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" is one of those discs that's groovy enough to make you shake your thang, but also mellow enough for chillout diehards looking to stay indoors on that Sunday afternoon. Hypnotic and refreshing, the disc serves up thumping beats, jazz influences, and warm, soulful vocals that go down easy. There's food for thought, and there's also food for the soul. ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" falls into the latter category."
4,"Good, relaxing - it IS Beautiful","This album is everything I'd hoped Miguel Mix's ""Nude Tempo 1"" would be, but wasn't. Unlike that CD - which was a BIG disappointment, this one has much the same basic beat but it stays SUBDUED and in the background, rather than overwhelming the Artists. Result is that the unique ARTIST'S contributions come thru on each track. ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" lives up to the name - it's relaxing, cool and refreshing..."
4,Smooth and Sophisticated,"""When all of the anger falls awaythere's only the love that we began with""With a smooth and sophisticated style Blue 6 creates a consistent soundscape throughout a relaxing contemplative album that seems to define chilling. Vocals slide across the music like silky sheets on a steamy night.The songs are sexy, thoughtful and at times dreamy. ""Just think of me and you're always close to home"" makes this soothing. ""Sweeter Love"" and ""Grace"" get a little breathy and ""Very Good Friends"" is pretty stunning in its contemplative elements.Once you enter this album, there are no major surprises to worry about. The mood stays very consistent and smooth with beautiful elements to help you relax and maybe even put you in a romantic mood.""I let it goyou let it go""~The Rebecca Review"
4,"Skip a Beautiful Tomorrow, this is HOTT today!","This CD very rarely leaves my CD player, and as a semi-retired club DJ it has given me many hours of remixxing pleasure!It is the prologue to any cocktail night or even after hour's entertainment. This is what 'Deep House at its pinnacle' actually should mean!This CD is the absolute perfect culmination of Sade meets Downtempo/Chillout music. I would recommend this to anyone seeking to leave the monotonously heavy 4/4 House beats and crowded club music craze. I liken this genre as `grown folks' House music with its sexy, soulful grooves and non-stop seductive aura.As has been mentioned here before, if you enjoy anything like Nuspirit Helinski....you should be very, very pleased.If the above music suggestion leaves you a bit dry, try the vivid image of slipping into a warm bath and relaxing your worldly cares away.Now....proceed to slip into a Beautiful Tomorrow."
1,boring.......,"i'm sorry, i just don't understand the hype this disc is receiving.it's just so generic. absolutely lacking any character or personality. well executed but little else. try costes 3,sounds of ibiza cd2 or rinocerose' new one.. there's just so much better music out there. just my opinion. but borrow this one before you spend the cash."
3,"Affordable, but Not Complete","Some big hits are here, but many are absent. Recommended only for music lovers who need a few Orbison songs at an affordable price. All original versions without liner notes."
4,An Excellent First Novel,"This is an excellent first fantasy in a three-part series by the author. The incompetent meddling of two wizard apprentices results in the calling forth of an uncontrollable demon from the underworld. Thus starts a 200-year takeover of Woodbyrne Forest. Prince Aaron must rise above his station in his kingdom to establish a critical alliance with the forest elves to throw out the demon and his henchmen. Needless to say, obstacle to the process pop up everywhere. A classic fantasy format, the author does a good job of storytelling with all the right elements. We rated this book four hearts. -- Bob Spear, Heartland Reviews"
1,Absolutely Terrible,I had a shred of a memory of watching attack of the killer bee girls while at parties in high school on USA up all night. I wish I had drank a little more while I was there and forgotten this completely. I was expecting it to be so bad it was funny but it was just a lame waste of time and money. I didn't watch the other movie.
2,Could have been so much better,This book was ok but it could have been so much better... Ms. Jacksons story of course was the best out of the four...the story by Ms dawson was ok but i felt as if something was missing from the story ....Now on the other had the stories by ms King and Ms Reid were horrible.....Ice Princess felt more like [slattern] princess...I know that most of the stories like that are great however some how ms King just made her character seem like a [adulteress] and just plain stupid....and then Ms Reids story...what was the point of hers...how did she ever get that story published...Now if you Girls want a great book full of diffrent stories then check out LETS GET IT ON
4,"FASCINATING, INSIGHTFUL","This book is a fascinating academic collection of essays about post-contact Hawaii's history in the context of health and medicine. Although a bit admittedly biased, the Kahunas are definitely not romanticized in this book. The constant reference to anecdotal quotes or comments from critical westerners about Hawaii's traditional beliefs and Kahunas got old sometimes. I especially enjoyed the rare quotes from his references that I would never be able to find. Bushnell tries to present a balanced historical look at old Hawaii's medicine and health. It is a great reference and very readable."
1,Disappointed & Biased,"Any book that has 87 pages devoted to sights in the British Isles, 200 to Western Europe, while less than a 100 pages cover all of Asia (including ONLY 12 pages on India and 8 on Turkey) can never claim to be a worldwide guide.This book should be called ""1000 Places to see in the Western World ... with some additional visits around the world sprinkled in so I can reach the 1000 number and make the editor happy""Ms. Schultz overlooks so many great sights in the world and even in the U.S. for some just mundane and lame ones (BBQ places in Missouri - come on.)I am sure Ms. S had a tough task - but the least she could have done to her readers is to let them know how biased the book is!"
2,Seasoned Traveler,"Having made a lifestyle of travel, I was excited to find this book to compare with my own experiences. I was very disappointed with the Eurocentric bent of this book. There are over 400 entries for Europe and less than seventy for all of Africa, not to mention the rest of the world. I know this is the author's personal list, but I fear it reinforces the view that ""culture"" can only be found in Europe. If you enjoy finding things truly off the beaten path, I recommend that you do not rely on this book for inspiration."
5,Most comprehensive guide for s/he looking for the best.....,"Schultz's vast experience and many kilometers traveled are evident in this wonderful book. It is written clearly and with her quirky style entices you to hop on a plane and take off. I second all of her reccomendations for Italy, living here myself. She is right on target."
3,Book hard to hold amoung other things,I found this book hard to hold and read because it was small and exceedingly thick. In looking thru the content I found it OK but there is not enuf concentration on single places to visit in a specific place. I was not terribly impressed and would buy only at a discount and really like something like Frommer's better.
3,"Good or Bad, or just both",This book is a little bit of good and a little bit bad. I read future reviews about it and they all said that it had to many hotels. I thought maybe they were exaggerating so I got it. After reading the first couple of pages you knew they were telling the truth. The book was great and it was full of some sites. At least one half of the places it mentioned were about hotels. And seeing as I want to see sites and not hotels I was a little pissed off. It was set up really good though.
2,a book about hotels,"I have to reinforce what others have said. This books tends to stress 5 star hotels and fancy restaurants. One of the entries for Dublin is to go to a fancy french restaurant. I can see having a pint in a Dublin pub as a thing to do, and she has recommendations for that. But for fancy french food, I think I would go to France."
4,"A great life ""to do"" list","I liked the depth of coverage of the 1000 things, but I think some of the 1000 things are sort of questionable--I am doubtful that I will miss staying in the numerous hotels it lists before I die."
2,She is missing wonderful places.,"I received it as a birthday gift and first thing I did was looking for a place in Central America, El Salvador and there is nothing about this country. There a so many amazing places to enjoy in this country."
4,So much to see and so little time,"This is a must have book for the seasoned traveler, the unseasoned traveler, and the dreamer. Patricia Schultz does an admirable job aggregating the ""travel wonders"" of the world. She covers Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia-New Zealand-Pacific Islands, the United States-Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean-Bahamas-Bermuda.Having traveled extensively in my adult life, I cross-checked the places I have visited with Shultz's experience. One could nit-pick here and there, but overall, she has done a remarkable job. She validated my experience and opened up my eyes to many more places that I must see before I die."
1,Paper format wrong choice,"I heartily agree with all those who were taken aback by all the posh hotels included while cultural and recreational events and sites were not included.Gotta say, though, that it's the paperback format that really detracts from this book. It's too darn heavy to be so small! By page 35, my wrists were exhausted! And, what was the publisher thinking by using such small margins. It was so tightly bound that I frequently had to ""split"" it open - and the margin around the edges where the user holds the book - well - I spent more time shifting my fingers so they wouldn't cover the text than I did reading.Finally, there should be a all inclusive checklist that the reader can mark those places he/she has visited.Would not purchase this unless you've got REALLY strong arms."
5,great book for great places,"I really like the way this book is written! It has great places, great tips, interesting spots to see that have sparked my interest in doing more traveling as a result. It's a great book for resources, and a great book for traveling ideas!"
3,Good but not Great,"I thought this book was good but great. Very focused on hotels, and some amazing ones a that, but not enough variety for me. Too many 5 star hotels. For most people, it's more of wish list."
5,From Alaska to Zanzibar,"This book's description of Alaska's Inside Passage partially influenced the choice of my wife's 30th birthday gift. But had we not read the rest of Schultz's Alaska chapter we would not have gotten off the ship and experienced some of the most remote and awesome lodges and heli-hiking destinations that have just returned us back home exhilarated and ready to check out her other 900-some suggestions. I lived in Italy for 13 years until recently and one could swear Ms Schultz is Italian herself, so perfectly has she chosen those Italian destinations both world-renowned and quietly hidden that make up the quintessentail Italian Experience. My feelings are the same for her coverage of a number of other European countries I feel I know almost as well and much of Asia where I travel often for business.Who needs a travel agent?"
4,A bible of where to go and what to do,"This is an amazing book!If ever there was a life's guide about where to go, what to do, what to see, then this is it. If you only ever buy one travel companion, this would be the one.Great book!"
5,I WISH I HAD AN UNLIMITED CREDIT CARD,I also have a list a places to see before I die and reading this books makes me never want to die. There are so many places to see that just reading this book makes me wish I had an unlimited credit card. This book is as interesting as it is helpful in planning my next vacation since I am not a beach/resort type of person. I love to see places of historical significance and the author has included lot's of places to see. I recommend this book to anyone with the desire to see the world.Bravo Ms. Schultz for an amazing book. I hope you have more books in the works.
5,An Incredible Guide for Travelers. 10 Stars!,"Patricia Schultz did one outstanding job in painstakingly putting together a travel guide for just about any type of traveler. From the not-so-well-known destinations, to the phenomenal sacred sites, where to dine, incredible beaches, contact information, phone numbers, museums, you name it, this book has it.Whether you are planning a honeymoon, want to organize a trip or retreat to sacred sites, take your family on an incredible vacation, or see just one place you have always wanted to visit, you will find everything you need in this magnificently organized book.As an avid international traveler, I can tell you Schultz brings you the best destinations, no matter what your budget, along with everything you need to know once you get there.An OUTSTANDING Book!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"
5,"World Ventures, Dream trips and 1000 places to see!","This was agreat book and resource guide. It is similar in nature to ""World Ventures Inc., Wayne Nugent, Mike Azcue, Dan Stammen, Robert Oblon, Wesley Melcher, Marc Accetta"" where you get a good sense for travel industry, dream vacations, travel location know-how and more. These guys provide solid information about travel opportunities and much more. The best thing about 1000 places to see however is the wealth of information."
5,wonderful,"Am traveling to europe in November on a much anticipated vacation, after reading a 1000 places I found myself changing my itinerary to places I never knew existed,since I am only an occasional traveler I found the information extremly helpful, it will certainly be a permanent part of my library, well done Ms. Schultz."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I was really excited to get this book a few years ago. I love travelling and I hoped this book would help me find some places that were must sees. As I read through it though, I discovered that a large majority of the places listed were hotels. It was a huge disappointment. The hotels aren't even ones that most people could afford to stay in (much less a military family with 4 children). I've had the pleasure of visiting many of the locations listed in this book and I must say that looking at the exterior of a hotel in whatever town I was in was the last thing on my must-do list."
4,I bought two more copies for my sons,"so they can dream too about visiting the wonderful places around the world the author describes. I've visited many of the US destinations and a few foreign ones and agree with over 90% of her recommendations.I have one complaint, and for me it's large. The cost of most of the recommended accomodations are out of reach for most travelers except for the wealthy. I estimate the average hotel or resort will cost around $300 per night(rack rate). I subscribe to a business periodical whose subscribers have well above average incomes. Only 3% of them said in a recent survey that hotel costs are not a consideration. A notation that more moderately priced accomodations are available in a particular destination would have helped.This is a great bedtime book. Sweet dreams."
5,I hope you have a good pension!,"I bought this as a gift for my father and his wife, and couldn't help but peak through the whole thing first. This book is for the dreamers. May way all see at least 100 of these places!"
1,OVERRATED!,"This book is overrated and a waste of your precious time and money. Selections are poorly compiled with little detail. Besides his advice on getting to most destinations is to use certain tour companies - which undoubtedly compensate him handsomely for - which I find obscene. Forget the royalties, I wonder how much he is getting for that!In conclusion: Don't bother, you will just be dissappointed."
4,Good Worldwide Selection,"Not only covers the exotic foreign lands, but our own American backyard. But who's-to-say what are the 1000 places to see? Everyone has their own idea of that special dream vacation. This book is a good source to consider maybe some place never dreamed of before."
1,Good film/bad reproduction,"""Murder"" is a very interesting film, one of the first to explore jury deliberations. The film has the feel of a live play, rather than a film. The acting is very good. The ""Lodger"" is also interesting for those who want to understand Hitchcock and his techniques. But, it was his first film and shows his youthfulness. However, the Whirlwind DVD reproduction is dreadful. The quality of the images vary from scene to scene. In general, the objects are blurred and out of focus and the imagery is very dark. The sound is not very good either. I have an old VHS version that I taped directly from television and it is of much better quality. In my opinion, don't buy this version but wait for someone else to produce a better quality reproduction."
1,"Too tight, ran small","I ordered a size 3 for my son; however, when I got them, they were so hard to unlace and then I had to practically shove his foot into the shoe. Once in, I realized that they ran about a size too small and were really tight. I didn't want to pay $6.99 to return, so I'll sell them."
5,Nicely written book for rarely found subject,"Pros:This is one of the only two books available covering EIGRP in details. Most of other routing references do not have the same level on in-detail descriptions and protocol-specific information this book has. Add to that the smooth style of the authors which makes reading this book a pleasant experienceCons:May be EIGRP's code is not finalized yet and there are many enhancements added after this book is published. I think the authors need to issue a second edition with more information regard new features in the protocol. Although the book gives numerous examples of real life scenarios, It cames short of small pool of theoretical details "" which are necessary if you run into *other* scenario rather than the ones listed. Finally, as many networks are migrating from IGRP to EIGRP, I think the authors should designate section for the migration process"
4,Perfect Fryer for Small Batches,This fryer works great. It heats up fast and holds temperature between batches. Very little splattering with lid. I'd recommend it for two people sized jobs.
3,Cuisinart Compact Deep Fryer,"Fryer is perfect for two people, who are preparing more than one side dish. Fryer heats quick and cooks well. Make sure that you do no overload the fryer---food will not cook evenly even with additional time. Oil does not heat at maximum if basket is left in the fryer."
4,great appliance only one problem...,"Great appliance! practical. One problem... due to the heat, the temperature knob selector is plastic made, burns fast and it is not replaceable. At least I haven't been able to find it!"
5,Deep fried goodness,"There is nothing better than deep fried goodness, and when you can do it yourself, and determine the ingredients (so you can pretend it's a little but good for you) well that's just awesome. This works great, it's the perfect size for two of us. There have been a few times that I wished it was bigger, but for the 2 or 3 times that I need more fry power vs wasted space and oil all the other times, well this is just perfect. I do wish it went just a little hotter but that's my preference and it's really not necessary. overall it's a great machine and super easy to clean."
4,"fine product, outragous shipping","The product itself is fine. Decent quality, not splintery chopsticks.The shipping was more than the cost of the item, though, so i will not buy them again."
2,kinda small..,"Disclaimer #1: I love my All-Clad pots. Love love love.Disclaimer #2: I don't own this.But isn't three quarts kinda small to make Cassoulet?? When I make it each fall, it fills the largest of my roasters (and even mounds over it). I have no idea how I'd get a mutton shoulder, a pork shoulder, a duck, a pound of sausage, and five (when dry) cups of beans into such a wee thing -- unless I had several of them."
4,Good book,"This Book covers many aspect from an exam(70-315) point of view as well as for knowledge purpose. I read this book as well as Microsoft Press Book.One thing to note....The CD accompanied with this book does not give you clear picture about exam questions. It just asks you simple questions, no syntax questions or questions based on few lines of code. Compared to this,the CD accompnied with Microsoft press is really good. I would suggest reading this book and using Microsoft press CD for getting more confidence for exam. Also, you need to read more articles from MSDN on database chapters(Dataset and Constraints) apart from this book if you are targetting exam. Otherwise this book is just great."
3,Do not use this book alone,"I liked the book very much; it's well written, clear and concise. Kalani is undoubtedly an excellent author. But I bought it with the intention of using it as my only resource for preparing for the 70-315 exam and it turns to be that this book alone is definitely not a good preparation for the exam. Its exercises are far easier than the real exam questions and it doesn't cover all the exam details...for example it never mentioned that you must use OleDbClient classes instead of the SqlClient classes for SQL SERVER 6.5 (and believe me that it's important).Luckily I managed to get a TestKing preparation exam (but unluckily I didn't complete the exam since I thought that TestKing's exam was unnecessary difficult), and to my surprise the exam's question where very similar to the TestKing practice!To summarize, it's a very good book, but you'll need extra practice exams to pass your exam.PD: I passed the exam."
1,This is NOT quite the best!,"This is made in China and doesn't have an interior mirror finish. If you are expecting the same quality as a USA made All-Clad piece, you will be disappointed."
3,Great little single,"Not a bad little single. Pounding is a fairly straightforward song, lots of banging and loud noises. The joy again is in the bsides. Far from grace is a beautiful sounding ethereal song and northenden sounds like a quaint childrens song with some lovely violin interludes, plus you get the video.The 2 bsides are in stark contrast to the title track, being almost from a nursery rhyme setting.There is also the dvd single out there with 2 remixes on them not found on any cds in Satellites [soulsavers remix]and M62 song [four tet remix]. Use of some sound capture software that turns dvd audio to mp3 audio will allow you to own these 2 songs."
5,Sade a Pleasant Surprise.,The service was quick and the product was in great condition. Thank you kindly.
5,sade.....what can i say boys????,nothing compares to listening to sade in a perfect accoustic room. JBL speakers make the difference.
1,2005's Worst game ever!,"This game is simply a nightmare. If somebody could get through the game, I'm impressed. Especially the dancing stages. This game was a COMPLETE waste of $50."
2,I'm too shallow for this arm.,"Right up front: I loved ""Lost in Space."" Insightful lyrics, a dash of melancholy, and tunes you can sing along with. On ""The Forgotten Arm,"" we're getting two out of three--the first two. I think that ""concept albums"" generally are a mistake--see, I like to write my own stories in my head as I listen to songs--and ""The Forgotten Arm"" is no exception. A bleak downer about a guy--well, about a guy I don't care much about. Let's just say I wouldn't have purchased the book, had this been a novel. Too long on integrity, too short on entertainment. Oh, well, here's to the next one...."
3,An album.,"That's really all I have to say about Forgotten Arm. It's an album. It's okay, technically proficient...very workmanlike. It sounds like Aimee Mann. It sounds like a lot of the mid-90's singer/songwriter stuff but maybe a little more technically skilled. Nothing about it leaves a particular impression. You want to get into Aimee Mann, get her older classics. This is an uninspired rehash, with no particular problems or drawbacks. Or...risks, that might create problems or drawbacks. It does have this theme where it's a narrative about this woman who's in love with an upstart boxer...but the theme isn't very interesting. 'The Forgotten Arm' is...an album."
1,Make sure you know what you are ordering.,"I had checked this book out at my local library and then ordered it for my grandson's 10th birthday. When the book arrived I found that it was less than half the size of what I had anticipated and it was a simple soft copy rather than hard bound--very minimal for the substantial cost. I reported same to the sender who responded quickly and appropriately explaining it had been miscoded and that he would return a portion of the cost. I have not received a check as yet--I assume it will be reflected in my Visa statement.I later read the story with my grandson and found that much of the magic found in the wonderful detail of this story had been edited out. Perhaps it would work for a younger child, but we found it somewhat lacking."
4,Give it a listen,"Blue Rodeo is a tough group to catagorize. Their sound is a mix of rock with a country flair. Jim and Greg have different writting styles which compliment each other very nicely. This is Blue Rodeo's most polished effort to date. Each song is a story and makes you want to listen to it again as soon as its over. The songs are ballads, rocking and in between. Before you know it you'll be singing along."
2,It doesn't get much worse...,"Well, actually, it could. Picture quality and dubbing are indeed quite good.But that's not why you'd buy an italian horror movie, is it? Here's the downside: ridiculous acting, effects that are nowhere near special (and few and far in between, too), a plot and characters that in most cases make little or no sense... So, unless you're a hardcore collector of italian C movies, think twice before you order this - there's much better stuff around to spend your money on."
3,counterpoint,"I feel that someone should speak the opposite viewpoint, seeing that only one review has been posted. I find this CD ""so addictive"" , to quote Missy Elliot. I thought that ""thugg it"", ""party tonight"", and ""so much chedda"" are particularly cool, and ""rat head"" and ""dub cm'd out"" deserve an honorable mention. I don't own the original version of this (I prefer the screwed versions of rap records), but i'm sure the original is probably more to the average consumer's taste. Grab this up, and do yourself a favor and grab up david banner's ""mississippi"" too. Peace to all."
3,"Nice Photos, but text seems a bit jumbled.","Very nice displays of guns and accoutrements, but the text suffers. Accounts are often presented in isolation, and the book seems to only follow a loose chronological order. Probably worth the photos, but the book is far from resembling any kind of scholarly undertaking."
4,riveting,"I could not put this book down. I thought it was a psychological thriller with wonderful characters and a plot that engaged me from the begining.I found all the characters to be ones I wanted to read more about.In the beginning I, also, found Jessica to be unlikeable and hard to care about, but as time went by, it was easier to care for/about her.I thought Inspector Rick Terry to be a sensitve and smart man and I look forward to further books by him."
5,excellent,This is an amazing book. A must read for anyone interested in race theory. Omi and Winant are very insightful authors.
4,Little tikes PLEASE fix the button,"First, I got mine for 14.99 at Target. Everything is great on this except the button, you have to push it in and hold it while opening it with your other hand. Way to hard for a 2 or 3 year old. My son is 3 and he can do it.....but with alot of effort. It turns the food in a circle, counts down the time and sounds off when the food is ready along with ""careful its hot"". A good addition to your little ones kitchen."
5,Great,"This was very touching, the acting was good, and the events were fairly accurate. If you have read up on William Tyndale, this is a fine movie to watch!"
2,I hated P-Chem anyway....,A very quantitative and somewhat confusing text. My good friend hung himself after looking over it for 15 minutes. We cremated him and Karplus together.
4,A good resource,"This is a good resource book for those who have heard of a neighborhood but know little about it. The book should have gone into more detail and provided more pictures but it is, nonetheless, a good book to own."
5,delightful,"This lovely little book discusses dozens of Brooklyn neighborhoods. Although it is too focused on pre-1950 history for my tastes, it nevertheless gives lots of current information on transportation, neighborhood landmarks, and even (in one of the appendices) the demographic makeup of each neighborhood. I am moving to NYC in August, and look forward to using this book as I explore Brooklyn!"
4,excellent,"The first major novel that shows Nobel Laureate Saramago coming into his own. He is a worthy successor to Portugal's greatest novelist, Eca de Quieros"
3,101 Sportbike Performance Projects,"If you can get a great deal on this book and don't know a damn thing about motorcycles, then you may benefit from the overly generic information within. It very simply states some common upgrades and maintenance, but does not have enough detail to really help a novice mechanic complete any of the listed projects. At best, it is a good reference so that you don't embarrass yourself when you go to a good shop and talk about what you want to upgrade. It's not horrible, just not wonderfully helpful."
5,LOVED IT!,"My children loved this! My husband and I also enjoyed the play on the Beatles, etc. My personal favorite is ""Rebel L"" while my son adores ""Grouch Girls"". Definitely a good investment."
4,Not what I was expecting...,"I bought this CD basically just to have ""Letter B"", one of my favorites from childhood. Unfortunately, the version on the CD is not the version from the show with the muppet Beetles singing the song. I don't know where the CD version comes from, but it is horrible - barely even follows the Let It Be melody. Likewise other songs on the album, which seem to be take-offs only in title. Very disappointed.UPDATE 11/11/09I am updating my review to four stars because I know realize that the problems I first posted about have more to do with my memory than the CD. The version of Letter B on the CD is how it ran on Sesame Street. Somewhere, over the last 2-3 decades, my memories of the songs had shifted. I prefer my memories to reality, but I'm not going to hold that against Sesame Street. This doesn't portend well for my next three decades..."
1,Too many errors!,"I love cryptograms! But I can't abide errors in them. Not only does this author break the rule that letters shouldn't stand for themselves, but there are actually several errors in these crytograms. I assume these are typographical and a sign of bad editing but it's no fun to work out cryptograms when you can't be sure they're correctly coded. On the positive side, the quotes are varied and fun and with some re-editing this would earn some more stars!"
5,Great!,"I don't understand why so many people have bashed this album. The songs are well-crafted, and the vocals of Goran Edman are terrific (he's Yngwie's best vocalist). Sure, there's some pop here, but so what? There are enough guitar heroics here to satisy most axe freaks. To all of you ""Eclipse"" bashers, geez...lay off, will ya? This is good stuff."
5,Couldn't put it down...,"For a biography / psychology book, I was pleasantly surprised by just how readible this book is (once you start reading, plan on being glued to it until you're finished). A fascinating slice of history, it's useful and insightful reading if you're a parent (or planning on becoming one), or if you're interested in the roots of the controversy over medical research with primates, or if you're just looking for tips on what makes humans tick. Well worth the read if only to put B. F. Skinner's experiments and theories into a frightening human perspective."
5,superb live album from traffic,On the road is one of the best live albums from Traffic with extended songs with superb guitar solos from winwood.Highly recommended.
4,Traffic JAMS,"It seems like there was an endless supply of good to great live albums in the 70s (Stones-Get your Ya Yas, J. Giels-Full House, Allman Bros Live at the Filmore, Who-Live at Leeds, ELP-Welcome Back etc. etc.) this is another good one. Kind of sloppy (in a good way) jazzy jams (Chris Wood was a really easy listen as a saxaphonist) from Traffic's matured phase (Low Spark, John Barleycorn, Shoot Out). Start with the studio stuff and if you like those, this is a great addition."
4,"Another good, engaging work!","Gilbert Morris continues to produce engaging works that entertain and challenge. In The Shadow Portrait, Morris mixes history, romance and the pursuit of artistic vision. While a bit formulaic (many fiction series are), I have enjoyed each and every book in the series and look forward to more!"
5,3 Big Movies - 1 Small Price!,"Would have loved to had all 4 in one pack, but for the price, It was Mission Impossible to pass up. Three Mission Impossible movies come economically packed and ready for action. Not a lot of extras, but it was just what I was expecting and I would endorse it again and again!"
1,What in the world...,WHy would someone buy this? The 4th movie is about to come out and then there will be another box release with all four movies in it... Come on people... Quit trying to rob everybody
3,Reality Check folks...,"I see a lot of glowing reviews here for the Mission Impossible Blu-ray set. How? Why? Each disc in this set is encoded in MPEG-2 and with only a lossy DD 5.1 soundtrack. So at best here, you're only getting an upscaled DVD transfer. Well, not really, but more or less. When these are remastered to MPEG-4/AVC with lossless DolbyTrue HD 5.1 tracks, then I'll buy. Not before."
2,Good price,"It was a good price but the transfer they used was very poorly done! Very grainy and poor sound. Not amazons fault, just the producers of the disc. A lot can be done when doing the transfer to make it so beautiful. Example alien looks great, these not so much!!"
5,Simply Awesome!,"I remember seeing the first 2 of these movies with my dad and brother in the theatre when I was younger...and then number 3 with a good friend of mine after it's release. Great movies! I had owned them all on DVD at one point but had gotten rid of them eventually after I had gotten a Blu-Ray player, because I was decided on upgrading them to Blu-Ray, as I felt they were Blu-Ray worthy titles. It took me a while, but I finally got this set of them, and just in time too, as Ghost Protocol is due out on DVD & Blu-Ray within a few days of me writing this review. It, too, was also a great movie and I will be buying it on Blu-Ray as well. Great movies if anybody has never seen them...I recommend checking them out!"
4,dvd,"For my husband and he is loving it and the action is great. Price was great, too, so couldn't pass up the deal"
4,Raze is kickin'!,"Raze-Power is a great CD! It mixes all different kinds of music to create a unique style. Has great beat, great message (cool lyrics), and cool techno features. Love it!"
3,A pretty good CD.,"I received ""Raze power"" as a gift. It is a very good cd, with great lyrics. It has pretty good songs in it, including ""Always and Forever"" from WoW '00."
3,Has a plastic piece,"Topeak chose to build this with one hard plastic piece which is it's weakest link. The rest is built with strong parts. The hard plastic piece bends and will break with maybe 50 lbs of force (I didn't test it). The bending creates less stability in addition to the weakness of the plastic. If they had paid a little extra for an aluminum piece, it would probably hold at least 100 lbs. It's a shame to have all strong parts which can hold 100 lbs and then decide on one weak piece which can only hold 50. A stand is only as strong as it's weakest leak, of course. It's use is really only to be a portable stand you can take on rides. If you're going to use a stand at home, get atleast a chainstay/seat stay stand. I got one at performance for $25, and it can hold 100 lbs and works both on my tandem and single bike. It also lifts the tire up a little higher."
2,"It has potential, but....","I cannot recommend this device for most people. This little stand, while cute and convenient to tote along in your larger tool kit, is too flimsy and unstable for anything more than very delicate work. Lube your chain carefully, or check your rear tire for debris. It even says in the included instructions ""not to spin the tire rapidly, or apply the brakes abruptly"". If you do it will fling itself to the ground. The stand is also rated for no more than 30lbs, so is unsafe to use on larger hybrids or mountain bikes. If only the legs opened a little wider, or they used aluminum in place of the soft plastic, I would be willing to pay more for the convenience. Even setting on a level blacktop surface, my best road bike was knocked over with a slight gust of wind. I spent more on deraileur repairs after that than the darned stand cost!"
3,"The track ""One Blood"" is worth the money","This is a solo release of the Black Uhuru member Junior Reid. The title track ""One Blood"" is a dynamite Ragga track I was looking for a long time. The rest of the album is not of that kind but is also worth the money. That's the reason for the three stars I was giving. But - buy it if you're a bigger Ragga fan as I am."
5,VERY SCARY!!!,This is a very scary and suspenseful movie that has you in a panic the entire way through! I would recomend it to anyone who wants a scare.
2,More older Mac compatibility problems,"Just like Joe, I read the box and thought this card would work with my Mac G3 All-In-One because the only requirement was OS X. It did work fine, with my printer and keyboard.Then I tried to use an external USB2 hard drive, and it was really slow (USB 1 speeds). Then IOGear told me my hardware isn't supported.I even have a G3! But they don't support Beige, only Blue & White. (All-in-one is like Beige.)Read carefully!... we're supposed to check the website before buying any of their products? Well, no big deal, I probably won't buy any more of their products...."
5,The best Police Compilation,Don't even look for any of the other collections. This one is THE best. Besides including all of the major hits by this band-including the excellent 'Synchronicity II' which I have yet to see on any other collections-you also get a few lesser known tunes like 'Tea in the Sahara' which is great. These guys ruled the radio in the early and mid eighties. I remember hearing them all the time while my dad would shuttle me around to soccer practice...The extra cost of this disc is a small price to pay for such a great collection. Essential.
4,Thank god!,I think this product is great. It was kinda tricky getting the Ipod open But I love it the new battery last forever.
1,Truthfully...,"In my opinion, if you read the books and/or watch the movies the only one that fits (or is remotely well written) is Lothlorien (#10). The others, if you think of the time that LOTR was supposed to take place in, would not fit. Rock and third to fourth age don't go together very well. I'm not saying that anyone's wrong, it's just I think that they could have written the songs more arround the time period and about the emotions in that time. Lothlorien is meant to be a peaceful yet sort of eerie place, the music is very peaceful. I went though a lot of time and effort to find this CD and I think that my efforts were wasted."
4,A Canadian Keepsake!,"A Canadian author, Westland specializes in floral arrangements, recipes, and crafts. She divides this book by season (Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter) and includes a smidge of her speciality in each partition. Most fascinating are the dictionary excerpts that speckle her chapters with interesting tidbits about the language of flowers and what flowers symbolized to Victorians. Noteworthy are her floral baskets, bonnets, lace, nosegays, garlands, wreaths, and head-dresses; flower decorated eggs and flower pressings; pomanders, pot pourris, soaps, and perfumes; pansy jelly, floral spreads, oils, vinegars, cordials, syrups, and table settings. There is something Victorian to create for every holiday, and to give as a gift for every person.185 pages, including introduction, photographs, illustrations, extracts from Victorian dictionaries, recipes, and indexHighly recommended"
5,Inspirational,"Kinda helps you understand life and death. It is very inspirational - very similar to ""Tuesdays with Morrie' but it's just Morrie. Its a good and easy read."
4,Helpful,I love CD's because they are easy to listen to in the car while you are on the go. Great information in here.
5,Great book!!,Very informative and opened my eyes to some things I definitely can incorporate in my business. I just loved it !
2,coffee pot,"I purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr. old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have. He was very excited about having his ""own"" coffee maker, however after only a few days it quit working. The lights and sound still work but the water won't run anymore, he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy. He still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so I will probably not return it because I think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water doesn't work!"
2,"Lots of info, perhaps too much.","I felt a little bogged down by all the information contained inthis book. It seemed too detailed and included a lot of stuff thatdidn't really apply to just medical insurance (for example thecomplete hypocratic oath which doctors take)! Overall, it was a pretty good book. It would have been a great book if they had cut out about a third or even half of the information. I thought Guide to Medical Billing, by a company called ICDC was much better. A lot of the pertinent data without too much extra. I also liked a book called The Medical Billing Handbook by Jason Cummings."
2,insurance handbook for the medical office,"I was very disappointed in the 9th revision. Although the HIPAA compliance and e-commerce sections have been updated, the material in the workbook is exactly the same. That includes all the same editing errors from the last edition. I spend hours of my time ""re-writing"" these editions when they should be correct at publication. The same ICD-9 and CPT errors are still there. I am seriously thinking of changing books for my school."
3,Society and Diversity,"Antony Thomas' Middle Sexes explores diversity within sexuality that makes all people unique. Focusing on transgender issues accross society that film helps to create the feeling that diversity is good and that one of the keys to peaceful coexistence is tolerance for all views.The film's most powerful message is that there is no one real normal definition of human sexuality. All life is neither black nor white, male nor female. Everything and everyone is made up of shades of gray.The film makes its point by intoducing the viewer to other cultures where the idea of transgender roles are more accepted than in our own. We travel to India to learn about the Hindu third sex and to Thailand to get the insights of the Ladyboy community.This is a quite good documentary produced by Sheila Nevins for HBO. While it offers no stunning conclusions its message of diversity and tolerance is well appreciated."
5,Analyzing the American psyche and its fascination with death,"Mafia don Soprano and his associates have captured more than 11 million viewers in the HBO TV hit series; but what makes the series so fascinating &#65533; especially to psychoanalysts? The Psychology Of Sopranos provides an intriguing survey of the characters and attractions of the series, using the gangster family as a foundation for analyzing the American psyche and its fascination with death."
5,"Suspense, intrigue, mystery and the Truth","Suspense, intrigue, mystery and the Truth. Just what a good Christian murder mystery book needs. This book will take you on a wild ride through Texas, bucking you into glimpses of ranching, money, greed and the petroleum industry. Howard Wayne Kirby has died. He has left behind his latest trophy wife, a selfish son and a Texas-sized fortune. When his widow dies in an suspicious accident, police start trailing a murderer.At this time his illegitimate son, adopted and raised by another family, is looking for links to his birth parents. What Charles Jameson doesn't realize is that his attempts to find his past will place him in a hotbed of intrigue and framed for murder. How will Charles' family and Christian walk survive such trials? And what part has his slick and slimy brother played in all this? Read this book and find out. I promise you, you won't be able to put it down."
5,We love it!,Our favorite song is Cookie Monster's 10 Cookies. My 8 month old seems to enjoy this CD. We just wish it was longer!
5,You MUST buy this CD.,The sweet melancholy of this music put my mind in the soft twilight of a late afternoon. I wish Mr. Doulgas would tell us more about the Ars Nova Singers. Their voices are angelic.
3,Disappointing,"Maria Di Battista's look at the lively and complex women of '30s comedy is ultimately disappointing. While chapters on individual films are often interesting, the book contains too much repetition (the first few chapters seem to consist of di Battista pointing out--over and over--that these dames did indeed talk fast), and Di Battista's argument suffers from her failure to provide much of a historical context. Worth a look if you have a strong interest in the field; if you're just beginning to read about it, try Elizabeth Kendall's *The Runaway Bride* (which provides a context for actresses, movies, and genre), James Harvey's *Romantic Comedy from Lubitsch to Sturges* (not as analytical as it might be, but positively majestic in scope), and Stanley Cavell's *Pursuits of Happiness* (aimed at academic readers)."
2,This is a sellout of a video,"look, i love metallica(old and new) but this is sad, less then an hour and it has no performances. It has a bad description of cliff's death. There is also a lot of people talking who i don not even know, this is sad, and is not authorized by the Metallifu$@, and its a good thing. The video is also very poor quality, and it sounds worse then cliff 'em all. I just want to tell all the metallifans that this is a waist of money, and time. Id rather watch a Gimp Bixshik documentary or TRL(totally retarted loosers)then this video. Read a met documentary in a book form, or get a year and a half....., Hope that this was helpfull to someone.LONG LIVE METALLICA, AND HEAVY METAL."
4,Score!,"This band rips! Considering 95% of all pop-punk is beyond annoying, its refreshing to encounter a band that not only [isn't bad], but is actually really, really good! They are definately pop-punk and although this is normally like nails-on-a-chalkboard to me (excluding the classics, of course: The Queers, Screeching Weasel, etc.), The Flipsides retain enough of the ""punk"" sound on their album to avoid sounding like the cheesy ""powerpop-bands-that-like-to-pretend-they're-punk-bands"" that pervade the mainstream music industry. The Flipsides album, as well as their live performance, is spectacular. Sabrina's guitar and vocals really shine. If you like The Eyeliners, you'd probably enjoy The Flipsides as well."
2,Ok- but not from scratch,"This has a lot of good doggy treats, but it uses a lot of canned products (campbells soup, bisquick ect) and most recipes have cornmeal in them which is a dog allergen. Other than that it has lots of tips and lots of recipes. Just not from scratch..the semi homemade of dog cookbooks"
5,Excellent!,"Couldn't be more pleased with this book - it has great recipes, tips, and nutritional information on ingredients."
2,How boring ...,"Ernest Hemingway was a good writer, but not everything he wrote is necessarily good (that's called being human, I presume).Maybe being an established writer gives one the privilege of having any rambling published (and shame on those who dare say it ain't a masterpiece).This book does have an audience, though, maybe those interested in his lifestyle in Paris. Still, his style here is strangely anti-Hemingway-esque: too wordy."
1,Reflections from an NPD,"Our book club had read ""Paris Wife;"" and, as a follow-up, read ""...Feast"" the following month. Heminway wrote about people he met during the early Paris years with his first wife. Ernest Hemingway was so very full of himself that he had little kindness or graciousness to give to others.Through his writing, he exhibited many characteristics of someone with narcissistic personality disorder."
1,"Time ""not well"" spent","I like to read for enjoyment, learning, & inspiration. This did not do it for me!"
5,Hemingway in Paris,"I absolutely loved this book. I love all the real life characters and the time period of the 1920's in Paris. Paris is my favorite city and the area where Hemingway's first apt. was is near to where I stay while I'm in Paris. The recession that we're not having has hit our business very hard and we could not travel to Paris this year, but, reading this book makes me feel as if I am there."
3,great and evocative read.,"The first time I tried to read Hemingway I ended by throwing the book across the room. It wasn't until I read `The Old Man and the Sea' that I started to appreciate Hemingway's work. `A Movable Feast', unlike `A Farewell to Arms', didn't end up in the far corner of the room. There is a certain emotional authenticity in his sketches of Paris between the wars. I particularly enjoyed the anecdotes and observations made of Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald, which are the most developed characterizations of the memoir. The notion of ""the lost generation"" and Hemingway's meditation upon Stein's point were enjoyable and Fitzgerald's problems with measurement left me in stitches.This new edition contains a lot more than earlier editions, but is not without controversy as to certain editorial alteration. Supposedly, some remarks that are uncomplimentary to Hemingway's first wife Hadley have been removed. Nevertheless, this is still a great and evocative read."
4,Beautiful,"The selections were good & performed well. Also, good cause. The artists are well chosen for vocal quality so it is a good holiday cd."
4,"3 Stories, quality varies","This book is made up of the three novella's published elsewhere. They all involve an unnamed protagonist who has no record of his existence. The first one, ""The Eve of Rumoko"" is an entertaining suspense story which introduces us to the hero and gives us a thrilling plot without sacrficing style or depth of character. The second, ""Kjawlll'kje'k'koothai'lll'kjr'k,"" is by far the weakest of the stories a not very intriguing mystery not really comparable to the other two. However ""Home is the Hangman,"" the third story is excellent despite it's B-moviesh plot (killer robot from outer space). Zelazny manages to use this set to explore the nature of the human psyche while being thrilling and exciting at the same time."
4,Pilgrim's Progress,Very good book with different views and opinions. Highly recommend for reading so you can view and understand different ideas and opinions.
4,a lowly pilgrim,I love this book; the play on words is very helpful in remembering their message for the Christian on a journey of faith. The only negative commment I have is the old english language...I thought I was getting the updated version.But I can still understand everything.
3,The Pilgrims Progress,"I like to think at my age(56) things aren't always ""deep""; however, this is a little so or at least at this time. I have put it aside for now and will come back to it. I had just heard so much about the book since I was young that I wanted to read it. I WILL come back to it, but for now it is on the bookshelf. I was glad that I got an inexpensive copy-the shipping was more than the book, I think."
3,Rating this version...,"My rating is in reference to this particular version of Pilgrim's Progress and not to the book itself.I found this e-book impossible to read due to all the distracting Bible references scattered throughout the text. I would love to have access to these references, but they need to be foot-noted and not listed out, breaking up the story."
3,Pilgrims progress (thrift edition),Its an inexpensive way to familiarise one with a classic...not a keeper though. not something to display on your library shelf
4,very thoughtful,"I enjoyed this book very much. It really makes you think about all the pitfalls in life, and to keep your eyes on the prize ahead."
4,Really cute!,"Hi, i'm 12 years old, which i know is too old to be playing with dolls. But when my friend and i went to kb toys for old time sake, we saw these dolls and thought they were SO cute!!!! Their not that educational, but i gave them 3 stars for educational because they teach girls, ""Being tall is so last year"" or in other words, it's ok to be small. i really like these cute little dolls, and recomend them! i hate those brats and barbies that look like they're hookers! at least these doll dress decent. I think these dolls are better for younger girls. Barbies make girls feel like they have to be really thin, and bratz make girls think they have to dress are skanky like that. These dolls are better to look up to!"
1,Caused lock-ups with my machine,"I've used many pcmcia cards before with my computer (Compaq Evo n600c, WinXP Pro), with no problems. This card was the exception. First 5 times I used it, it worked great. After that, it would cause my machine to freeze whenever I inserted it. In the end, I discovered that the only way to get it to work was to reboot the machine at least once with the card already inserted. Driver updates did nothing to fix this problem. Major inconvenience and no support resources. Go with another card if you can."
5,This Works Great!,"I was a little nervous about ordering this because of another review here, but I took a chance and am very glad I did. I have a Dell Inspiron laptop and I plugged it into the slot it, installed perfectly and works like a dream. Couldn't have been easier."
5,"Easy Installation, works great, and cheap!","I didn't have any problem installing it in my Windows XP laptop, it was truly plug and play and didn't need any software. I can hot-swap the card or USB devices while the laptop is on without any problem. It's a great way to add USB 2.0 ports, and it costs less than other available adapters. All the negative reviews almost made me not to buy the product, but I bought it and very happy with its performance (480 mbps)."
1,This book is just a way to sell the documentation,"While I didn't expect very much since I've learned most Microsoft Press books are just a way of selling the documentation they should include, this book is extremely disappointing. About as deep as: ""To open this file, go to the Tools menu and select Open""...."
1,yup; re-print of the online doc- expected *much* more,"boy was I let down by this book- unlike some other reviewers, I have come to expect more from MSFT Press... pretty poor stuff. makes me sour just to think about it as I write this review. please, MS Press -don't do this again just to get a title out the door."
5,If music could evoke the passions of a sexual experience....,"This is one of the most outstanding displays of musical creation ever recorded. Commonly thought of as an Allman Brothers break up band, this group will make you wonder why the Allmans were never this good! An absolute must have for any fan of great music."
2,"""best of"" rarely is.","my familiarity with sea level was limited to ""on the edge,"" which i've had on vinyl for 27 years. i'd hoped to get it in cd but its not out in that format yet. i took a chance on the ""best of"" cd, and i have to say i'm disappointed. i loved sea level's instrumentals, and this compilation has too much vocals for my preference. furthermore, after one listen of ""shake a leg"", i cannot shake that refrain from my mind. don't misunderstand me, i love chuck leavell's work - with ABB, the stones,and his solo efforts. i hope sea level releases ""on the edge"" in cd format soon. in the meantime, i think i'll buy one of those new turntables and start burning my favorite old vinyl albums to cd format."
4,Allman brothers spinoff,"I tried this CD after becoming a fan of Chuck leavell. It is an interesting mix of Funk, latina, jazz, and rock. A great album overall though the various styles don't always blend."
2,Two stars for possibilities,"I'm giving the product two stars because I think it might work for training kittens. My experience with my 3 adult cats(two of whom are large males) was it didn't take two minutes to pull this stuff off. I think they were actually intrigued with it, and enjoyed the challenge. But it sure didn't stop them from going where they wanted to go."
4,"Love it or hate it, its kind of intriguing","I'm still not sure what to make of this album. People here either seem to love it or despise it. Personally, I like it a lot. NERD's funky, retro sound is different from anything out there today. (The tracks ""Maybe"" and ""Drill Sargeant"" showcase this the best) I also enjoy listening to bands/artists who are willing to take a chance and cross genre lines. They do have a few issues, though. The lyrics are often corny and embarrassingly immature (""her a$$ is a spaceship I'd like to ride"", ""I am in your aquarium""). That's something they really need to work on. I think it is something that can be changed as they mature, though. Overall, though, I like the album and I will be looking forward to anything new from NERD. I'd reccommend it to anyone who is open-minded when it comes to music. Definitely not for the so-called ""hardcore"" rock or hip-hop fans out there."
3,Love It Or Leave It,"I'm a die hard Neptunes fan and i have loved all their hits since rumpshaker (remember that?) haha. when i first heard this cd, i thought ""whoa, what IS this!?"" the music is...intriguing. it's the kind of music you have to get used to. it's extremely different than In Search Of..., this album practically strays away from their former hip hop vibe. so if you're expecting more ""Rock Star"" tracks, don't count on it. just open your mind and try to understand the music."
1,The lamest album of the year,"N.E.R.D.'s new album is one of the worst album I have ever listen to. Their last year's album was good, but I don't know why they came from rap to rock, but it really stinks. My advice to N.E.R.D.is come back to rap seriously. The reason why I'm saying this is because I saw Pharrell Williams and Shay performing on t.v. on the Saturday Night Live show. The way they were performing, it was devasting to me. If anyone agrees on what I'm saying, you all know I have a point."
2,a uplifting depression,this was a good cd.and i was happy for a sophmore and snl promo. but the time for me was bad since i got kicked out my grandmothers and lost my job songs like breakout. maybe. chariot of fire.. hits those chords of depression and helps you. but it takes you through an emotional rollercoater-those songs do..
4,Flavorful Coffee,The Mocha sweetener makes my day just a bit sweeter. I like it in the morning and I love it in the evening. Very delicious!
5,Splenda Flavors - Great In/On Everything!,"I use Splenda Mocha on lots of different things: To brighten up the taste of plain Cheerios (or other unflavored cereals), to put in plain oatmeal and even to add some variety to yogurt, and of course, in a cup of coffee! Mocha is definitely my favorite. I also like French Vanilla and Hazelnut. Caramel is okay too.I just wish that it dissolved better in a cup of coffee. Most of the time, the majority of it is floating on top of the cup of coffee.Overall, I highly recommend this product. The price on Amazon is great!"
5,When Tomb Raiders meets China,This is like a Chinese version of Tomb Raiders. The special effects were amazing and I wish I could see this in 3D. The dialogue is at a minimum but enough to follow the plot. This helps when reading English subtitles by providing time to look up and enjoy the movie. The quest for the Dragon's Tomb and the supernatural results reminded me of Tomb Raiders. I've seen plenty of Asian movies with a mixture of martial arts and supernatural effects but Storm Warriors takes it to a Hollywood big box office level. A really amazing movie.
5,"Ahh, The British are Coming!","The second coming of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones apparently have already come and conquered. Songs like ""Wonderwall"" and ""Champagne Supernova"" are instant 90s classics, but one can hardly resist the quirky charm of ""She's Electric"" or the creditability of ""Don't Look Back In Anger"". As little brother Liam belts out these tunes, even giving his older brother, Noel, a turn in ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", I have to realize that I have listen to this album one too many times. Not just in memorizing every entire lyric in the whole cd, but listening to it whenever I find a spare moment. Damn brits. Even so, this is a must-have for any follower of alternitve music, but also any Beatles or Rolling Stones lover."
5,Cant go wrong.,Had this album forever. Never got tired of it. still not tired of it. turned me into the superfan that i am.
4,Back in time for a time,"let's burst the bubble before I go any further... this isn't a classic album.It is and was, however, a good album filled with excellent singles. If the Gallagher bros. had it in mind to emulate the Stones and the Beatles, they got closer to the Stones in that regard. So let's think of Oasis as a singles band, and we'll all be a lot happier with the results.Case in point, this, their sophomore release. about 4 superb songs (Champagne Supernova, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, Some Might Say), a few fair-to-middling (Roll With It, the title track), and the remaining filler (She's Electric, particularly). My barometer is hummability and longevity, and about seven years after the fact, I can still get a bar singing along to the hits from the first 2 notes.Their reworking of the Beatles/Stones pastiche never got, or will ever get better than this album."
5,One of the greatest cd's ever made,I'm love this cd. It's probably my favorite cd. Those people who say that Oasis' lyrics don't make any sense are about as smart as my friend who likes to bang his against solid metal objects. The lyrics have a very deep meaning. Those people who say there just wanna be Beatles they're insane. I love the Beatles too. And they are very different. Buy the cd it's awsome.
4,Good C.D but havent we already heard this!,"My review is actually about a three and a half. It doesn't deserve a harsh three but does not deserve a four either. Oasis's What's the story (Morning glory) is a great album but it has no creativity to it. I can here Beatle music slightly changed all over the C.D. The same upbeat and then mellow tunes can be found all over The White Album, Sgt. Pepper's, and Abbey Road. Never the less this is the best of the Oasis collection. Don't buy this album if you want something fresh and new. If you really dont care where they get their music from buy it. But I would personally want the real thing."
5,The best album I've ever heard,"If you are doubting about buying this CD I say to you that you need to buy it because this is one of the best album for all the time. It has rock, rock 'n' roll and brit-pop. It has a lot of classics inside, like 'Wonderwall', 'Don't look back in anger', 'Champagne supernova'...I love this album!"
4,"Right Time, Right Place","I was very impressed with Definitely Maybe,just some good rock and roll music played loud with some great hooks and great melodies.Then 1994 rolls around and I heard Wonderwall....I was speachless,really taken aback by this great song.Getting Morning Glory and listening to it from front to back was indeed a great experience,so many great songs and finishing up with the very beautiful Champange Supernova.Years go by and I hear Wonderwall again on the radio and whenever I hear this song,I have to sit back and listen....comparing in a song your feelings for a girl to your feelings for your favorite album struck a huge chord with me and for that alone I give Noel a tip of the cap.Great rock and roll by a great rock and roll band."
2,A Great Home Theater System.,"I have tried few home theater systems; I have to say that the Panasonic SC-HT743 5-Disc DVD Home Theater System is on of the best.The built in amplifier stands out in providing high power levels of clear volumes with low distortion; insuring an enjoyable full surround sound experience.The Panasonic SC-HT743 5-Disc DVD Home Theater System gives an image quite similar to the image you see at any movie theaters.The speakers come in different shapes and sizes, from slim tall-boy tower speakers to bookshelf satellites, so they'll fit in any corner of your room, with our much effort.The built-in 5-DVD changer in the Panasonic SC-HT743 5-Disc DVD Home Theater System enables you to have up hours and hours of continuous music or movies without touching your system or any of your remotes."
3,My cover only had a picture of a camera on it..,"All I really have to say about this book is that it is a very acquired taste (which almost made me gag to type that phrase..).Kaysen is a decent writer but seems like she would be really miserable to know in person, so I'll just continue to be grateful that I only know her through her words.Fair warning to everyone: Always read the inside jacket description before you purchase a book. This title is very misleading.. ;)"
2,Where's the End?,"As someone who suffers from the same condition I appreciated how open the author was about her condition and how it affects every aspect of your life. It made me feel a little less alone. However, I am so disappointed by the completely abrupt ending! This book was incredibly short and seems like it was turned in incomplete. I actually checked to see if there was another version because I must have purchased the draft. Everything throughout the book is detailed and then all of the sudden, it's over. No explanation of how things turned out, no parting words, nothing. I feel ripped off."
3,Oh Great!,"Great, the joys of pre-menaupause.....really! REALLY! I don't know if I'm glad I read this book....It was painful at times just to imagine some of the experiences the aurthor went through....I am keeping my fingers crossed starting now....oh please oh please, i sure hope I don't go through that because I love sex way to much to just give it up like that; in such a painful way :-)"
2,Great Looking.......Side Scroller??!!,"So this is what we get after all these years of waiting? An updated version of Duke Nukem 2?This game looks great, it has the same Duke Nukem attitude, but its watered down somewhat. The biggest problem with Manhattan Project is it's 3rd person side-scrolling view, just a terrible, backwards idea. It would have been really cool if this game used Raven's GHOUL II engine, as it stands you need a magnifying glass to see all the action in this game. The save game feature needs some work too, why do programmers want to restrict where and when I can save my game?? That is very annoying. And if you think you get a lot of weapons to play with, think again.Plus the strippers in the game don't strip like in the previous Duke Nukems, what a rip-off!!"
3,not up to standard,"though this new Duke Nukem game is fun...it is definitely lacking. The side-scroller setup is quite annoying and makes the game confusing. thought there are plenty of pigs and babes, the game is not up to the normal duke standard. I mean...come on...the babes have clothes on!!"
4,Songs to Remember,"I heard about this band when i watched the movie 'Manhunter' and fell in love the 'This Big Hush' in the scene where the toothfairy is sleeping with the blind girl.This song alone is worth the purchase, coelcanath and nemesis are pretty good songs also. Nemesis would of been a good song to use in a thriller/horror movie, it's got that sound to it..i love this album and it will forever be on my top list."
3,pricy but ok,"Kept blowing out my transmitters so I'm going to give this a try. Spring loaded wire clamp not very durable (damaged when inserting 14 ga wire) but seems to be working, so far. Fairly pricy given the device's trivial circuitry but saves me the time of building one myself."
1,Still had house fire!!!,"I had this surge protector installed on my pet fence. My house still burnt causing almost $300000 damage.Save your money, lightning does what ever it wants to."
2,Disapointment,"The game does not have a unique concept. Interface controls are still poorly layed out. Players viewpoint is though adjustable, keeps shifting ( even in locked down behind the character mode)Game play itself, in a word, boring....LAGGGGG when your around other players, is so fearsome its sickening. Graphic models and terrain have collision and rendering problems. Also if you are just sick of the EQ zoning don't even think of Anarchy. You will see landscape and mobs beyond the zone line. hit the zone and pop up in an area nothing looks like what you seen through the zone barriers."
4,It just keeps getting better...,The second book in the SuperS series is great. The translation is pretty accurate and of course the artwork is beautiful. This book mainly focuses on Mina. She can't transform into Super Sailor Venus and she is a little embarresed about it. This book will leave you hanging and you will definitely want to go get book number three.
3,It's alright...,I like this book but I would pretty much like it if it were a manga and not just made into a book with the rest of the comic book manga. It leaves out all the good stuff that the Japanese SM manga's have so that's why I only rate it 3 stars. It's not that good and and not that bad either.
2,Up to chapter 3 and finding it useless,"I have just finished Chapter 3 of this book and am near livid. The author has a confusing and abstract way of writing that is infuriating for those of us living in the practical world. The discussion regarding the intangibles of requirements and interfaces is a quagmire of confusing definitions. So far I have pulled nothing of use from these chapters and am more confused than when I started reading.I am hopeful this all gets sorted out in later chapters because right now, this book is proving to be fairly useless at teaching this software engineer how to properly gather and formulate a requirements document.If you are into theoretical rhetoric, it's a good choice."
5,This CD is adorable,We love the track about Cows - i think i like it more than my 8 month old daughter now! haha.
5,10 stars!,"Rather than repeat other reviews that give this book / cd 5 stars, I will tell you this. Last Saturday, my 3 year old grandson took the cd and ""washed the floor"" with it. It was ruined, of course (title floors) and I was heartbroken, as was he and his sister. I am sitting today, 5 days later with the replacement on the cd player at work. This is an amazing book and cd, worth replacing a hundred times if I have too!"
4,My four year-old loves it!,Length:: 0:34 MinsPlease enjoy my first video review of a product.Philadelphia Chickens
1,cd not included,"I got my first book as gift, I move twice and misplaced the cd, so I was very disappointed that the book didn't come with the cd. So now i have 2 books and no music that goes with it."
1,Philadelphia Chickens,"Interesting you should ask. I receive a defective cd of Philadelphia Chickens, and Amazon refused to give me a refund because they said it was my problem. The cd I received with the book was okay, but the single cd was unplayable. Amazon's obviously did not review the cd upon its return."
5,I love this collection and have bought it as a gift for many people I know,"I love this collection, the music is great and so is the book. I purchased it for my self and for many friends who have children. I recommend this album very much."
5,Played it at dinner parties,"Our family got such a kick out of this CD we actually played it for our guests at a dinner party. This is music that has a humor and subtlety that adults will appreciate and subject matter kids enjoy. My boys 5 and 3 both love it. Most childrens music I find obnoxious, but this... 5 stars all the way!"
3,Not for me... but still contains there best,"Ok... BAD are my second fav. band on the planet, right under The Clash.I own all there albums, so a hits album is not needed by me, but for the casual listener this is very important. It takes there singles and puts them on one album!From the orginal line-up, to BAD2 and finsishing with Big Audio, from ""E=MC"" to ""I Turned out a Punk""a collection for the casual listener"
4,Not a light read,"Certainly not light reading! This book gives a lot of the mathematical background for actuarial tables. The chapters discuss various conditional probabilities in the developed world for life expectancy, given this precondition or that precondition.In some ways, the book is greatly unattainable. That is, if you live in subSaharan Africa or northern India or central China, where disease and malnutrition are still common. Plus the spectre of Aids/HIV, which has already had measurable lowering of the average life expectancy in several African countries. Those regions can only hope for the relevance of the book.Reasonably advanced knowledge of statistics is needed to get the most out of the book."
4,Splenda flavor sticks,"this is a great product but the last case I recieved, the powder was solidified on the bottom of the tube and I had to cut each one from top to bottom to get the powder out, that means I had to cut 180 tubes of splenda, I wrote the company and they offered me a coupon for 10% off my next purchase, big deal"
4,Nice alternative for regular Splenda,The flavour of hazelnut is not so strong so it works more like an aroma. I take it with a hazelnut flavoured coffee when I want to really feel the flavour. I like it.
2,Okay,"I've definitely read better; Kiss and Tell was slightly more interesting. Cherry Adair has a nice, realistic style, but if you're looking for deep charachters and intruiging plot twists, read Nora Roberts instead. the charachters were likable, the romance scenes were hot, but the plot was completely predictable and extremely boring.other than that, the exchange between the charachters was fun in parts, but the charachters had no depth and the storyline held no surprises.in other words, if you read romance for the sex and dialogue, you'll probably like this book; if you're looking for something more, go elsewhere."
1,"Oh, Pooh!","This book is totally Mills and Boon, only thicker. Not suitable for mature readers who are used to novels by writers such as Judith McNaught, Jude Deveraux, Teresa Medeiros, Christine Feehan, Linda Howard, ..well you get me.Maybe it was just this book, I don't know. I might try another book of hers just to see if she's what her fans says she is.All the best for your next book, Ms. Adair... :)"
2,Disappointed,"I had hoped for much more from my first Cherry Adair book - the recommendations had been so good. But the writing is simplistic, the characters lack dimension, the ""suspense"" is convuluted and not even remotely realistic, and the sex is formulaic. Silly me, to want a little romance in my romance novels! It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but I'll stick to Susan Andersen, Linda Howard and Karen Robards for my romantic thrillers from now on."
3,MEDIOCRE,"I was very dissapointed of this book. Not that it was bad - it just wasn't as good as the other two [HIDE & SEEK, KISS & TELL]. As a huge fan of Ms. adair, I'm sorry to say that I regreted pre-ordering the book. It lacks two things:1. Tally is a different kind of heroine than the other two, which I practically admired: they were actually female-warriors, equal to their men. Here it is annoyingly obvious that Tally is somewhat virginal (metaforically speaking)and sometimes even too-much-naive. I kept telling myself: ""There must be some plot here; Micheal is going to find out soon she's not such a goody-goody girl;It's going to be interesting soon!"" but she was, and it wasn't...2. The other two books had such great suspence, I couldn't put the book down. I've kept reading till my eyes got bleary. That's what made me CA' s fan. But that didn't happen in IN TOO DEEP.I'll look forward to her next book,as I keep dreaming of Hunt St. John, but I'll also wait for customers reviews."
3,Wished it was more about No Hitting,"I agree with the other users. I wish the book focused more on teaching about no hitting. Instead it was only referred to once at the beginning of the book. My 2 year old gets frustrated and hits sometimes, so I wanted an illustrated and fun book to teach her it's not ok to hit.But we love all of Karen Katz's books, so this is a good addition to our growing collection."
4,Son got the Point after Mommy reading this book to him!,My son use to be the ultimate hitter; once I purchased this book and read it to him over and over again he got the point. And when he would try to hit I would refer to the book and he would stop.
3,"good premise, but...","the alternatives (hitting a pillow instead of my baby brother) are still not the message I wanted to get across to my 1 1/2 year old child. I almost feel that if she was a little older, it would give her ideas as opposed to teaching her it's not ok to hit.We really like Karen Katz books, but this is not what I was looking for as a teaching tool about aggression."
4,a good video with information,after reading the two reviews that where on ... already i did what to expect when i got this video but after watching it i found out the other two reviews where ...! i can not understand the problem the other two people had with this video but i thought it was good so if you buy this video i hope you enjoy as i did the delivery room sequence was fantastic and lorenzo and michele presented the video in the way it was meant to be done
1,Limited functionality -- unadvertised limitations,"Unfortunately, I bought this product before the review by ""rchoate3"" was published. I bought this product specifically because of my cordless Logitech USB mouse, so I could use all of its functions. This switch does NOT support anything but garden-variety mice! You can find this out if you dig deep down on Iogear's website where they state that they do not support these devices and ""sorry for the inconvenience""! Iogear's specification on the same website does not mention any limitations. I think Amazon should mention these limitations. (To be fair, the device works fine if you have standard input devices, but then why bother with USB?)"
2,Disappointment &#65533; Use only with a 2-button mouse,"I bought this product with the intention of using it with my 5-button MS USB wireless Intellimouse and wireless Logitech keyboard. The box and documentation imply that the KVM will work with any USM mouse. The problem I'm having with the KVM is randomly, the right click menu will appear. This happens enough be a major interruption while working...about every 20 seconds. After a few emails with IOGEAR's support manager, I got to the bottom of the story; this KVM only supports two button mice! This is not stated anywhere in the product description or manual!!! They have an ""device emulation"" feature that prevents lag time in device detection when switching between computers by emulating the mouse and keyboard connection; The KVM emulates a two button mouse and standard keyboard. Since it is not possible to upgrade the firmware on this KVM, the only advice the support manager could provide was to either use a 2-button mouse or return the KVM."
2,Frustrating!,I purchased the IOGEAR GCS1714 4-Port MiniView III USB KVMP Switch Kit for my home last year and also puchased 5 here where I work. It seemed cool at first but the more I used it the more I noticed the problems with it. It seems when I boot into DOS mode or into the BIOS it send repeated keystrokes. So if I press the spacebar 1 time it will send 20 keystrokes which is very frustrating I have ended up having to bypass the KVM all together and hook up a normal keyboard. Also when I reboot my computer the device looses connectivity with the USB port on the computers. I have to manually unplug the device from the power to have it reset itself and sometimes I even have to fish around and unplug the USB cables 10 times before it reconnects. I have checked their website for any kind of support and there is none.I would recommend not purchasing this device.
1,not worth the expense,I do not like this shampoo and will never buy it again.I tried it because of the natural ingredients but it does not feel like my hair is clean after. I also used the conditioner and it doesn't condition my hair at all.
1,The new formula is worthless,"I used to love this conditioner, but it has been reformulated. It doesn't detangle and it leaves my hair dull and sticky. There is a sticker on the bottle that says ""New More Sustainable"". I appreciate their efforts for sustainability, but if it doesn't work, no one will buy it. I have long fine hair, so some people may not have the same issues with it, but I don't think they did a good job of testing the new formula before they put it on the market."
2,Drying and hard to lather,"This Shampoo does not lather easily and leaves hair dry and tangled. The conditioner is hard to squeeze out of bottle and in terms of improving the texture, doesn't help either. I have to dispense a generous amount even though I have short hair. On the flip side, The product smells great though and hopefully, doesn't have harmful chemicals.Overall review- didn't work for me :("
1,Hate the new formula,I used to use this conditioner and loved it. The new formula has ruined my hair. The old formula conditioned and left my hair sleek and clean. Now my hair has the texture of dried grass. I will be cutting my hair shorter to save it from what this awful conditioner has done to it. I tried to email the company and it said the website was down. Now I have to wait until Monday to call them.
3,Vague Politics; Good Groove,"More consistent than Gotham!, Radio 4's major-label debut Stealing of a Nation is too much a good thing or, in the case of this dance-inducing CD, too much of the same thing. Their Gang-of-4-at-the-afterhours-disco riffs are fun and, on a song-by-song basis, motivating, but the beat doesn't let up on this 12 song CD until the last track, ""Coming Up Empty"", which becomes the most interesting piece here by dint of its novelty (a faux-Eastern melody line and a tempo that isn't defined by BMP's). And their politics are vague, other than that they seem against it, whatever ""it"" is. Still, Stealing is a beautifully engineered CD with thick beats and pounding guitars. At this point, content would be nice, but isn't necessary."
2,Works But a Curse,"This is an acceptable scanner if you're looking for something small to scan an occasional page or two but the page feed design is awful. Jams frequently, has no feed delay setting, skews constantly. I normally need to scan the same page 2 or 3 times before it gets it right. For the high price avoid...Visioneer's earlier model desk scanners were much better designed."
1,MORE PLOD THAN PLOT,"I have been listening to between 20 and 30 books on tape a year for the past several years, and this is the first one I have been unable to finish. I managed to get through the History of Rome and have varied from Stephen King to Stephen Ambrose to Stephen Hawking. BUT, I could not get through this one. There simply is no plot, just tedium. You know the book is overwritten when you are constantly conscious of the words the author is using rather than rather absorbing the text in imagery. I did not read Donna Tartt's first book but wish I had not wasted the time on the second. I simply cannot see how anyone could find this work enjoyable, but ""to each his own""..."
3,Good until the last few pages.,"I really did enjoy all of this book, and was really excited to get to the ending and find out the answer to the mystery.I was sorely disappointed. The ending is anti-climactic, and that's putting it nicely. I enjoyed the journey to the end but once I got there I felt like reading everything up to that point was a giant waste of time.There were a lot of things I liked about the book, but I can't get past my disappointment. It's fantastic writing and the characters are interesting, but I really want a _story_ if I'm going to read a _novel_."
2,Waiting for Godot,"This novel started out with such promise--an intriguing mystery surrounding the death of a little boy. However, 250 pages into it, I found myself waiting for something to happen. It's a wonderful character sketch--I feel like I know the inner workings of little Harriet's mind intimately--but...yawn...where's the build-up, climax and denouement??"
2,I Was Robbed!!,"Well, I have to admit that when a friend at the library recommended this book, I approached it with an eager attitiude. However, since I finished reading it, I have to ask myself what, if any, was the point of this novel. Sure, all the critics say brilliant this and brilliant that. Blah, blah, blah. I know better than to trust a critic, but I am very dissapointed in my friend. The characters, while well defined, are boring and rather wooden. The author tried so hard to describe them, I feel she forgot to make the reader like them. I also feel that the ending left a large question mark in my mind. I mean, honestly, why on earth center your plot on such a feeble, glossed over section of the character's history. As I said in the title of my little tirade, I Was Robbed!!..."
2,Get On With It!,"I loved The Secret History, so was very excited when this book was released. Yes, she does capture the South and Harriet is an appealing little kid, BUT. . .This isn't Faulkner or any other Southern writer. The plot just meandered along and I kept wondering when she'd get on with it. It was as if she used fillers on purpose. Definitely not worth my time."
2,The Little Friend,"I enjoyed The Secret History and The Little Friend, but they share the same weaknesses. The story-telling is rich with emotional detail, but it takes a large part of the book, which is an exceedingly long book, to get to any real action. And the ends of both books are a bit of a let-down. It seems the author didn't quite know where to go, so she just stopped.Two breaking points for me. 1) The death toll of abused animals-can anyone write a ""serious"" novel without a pile of road kill anymore? 2)Editing-there is a reason that good editors exist. They make art better for curbing the author's often irresistable need to fill up pages with words. Telling a well-written tale includes a healthy sense of self-restraint. An author that can edit themself is truly a gift to readers everywhere."
4,Page turner,I really liked this book. It's very different to the secret history though. The story is set in the Mississippi area and therefore I recognize the atmosphere from the most Grisham'sBut Donna Tartt doesn't write towards a happy ending and that's why I like it more.I was really looking forward to this book and it was worth the waiting!
2,Infuritating waste of time,"The only reason I have generously given two stars is because I thought the plot was taking a good direction throughout the first quarter or so of the book, but went downhill from there. The completely unsatisfying ending was preceded by endless rambling. I held out until the end to hopefully see the murder mystery resolved...but no. Don't waste your time reading this book when there are thousands of others to enjoy!"
2,Library Journal Best Book of 2002 ???,"How many reviewers do you think were influenced by the success - and excellence - of Tartt's first novel?If the public was smart enough to pick out her first novel - and be right - might they not be correct about this one as well?The first dozen of so pages were great, but the author just got too enchanted with her own word processor."
3,Just couldn't make it through...,"I tried, oh, how I tried to get through this book. But when reading becomes more work than pleasure I feel it's time to throw in the towel.I was a big fan of Tartt's ""The Secret History,"" so I was really looking forward to a strong follow-up novel. In many ways, this IS a strong novel--Tartt gets very deep into each character and there is not a detail she glosses over--perhaps those are two of the reasons I found this such a tedious read. It starts off promising--dark, descriptive and full of mystery, but it seems that the mystery will take forever to unravel, and I just got so bogged down in the details I didn't care anymore.Maybe I'm just a dilettante, but I felt like there was WAY too much information in this novel, and rather than enhance the plot, it weighed it down and prevented me from making it to the book's end."
2,Tedious,"I was so relieved when I finished this book! I was on a waiting list at the library for it so I was eager to read it, but I must say it was tedious reading. I wanted to give up several times but thought I should continue, so I was quite dissapointed when I came to the end and nothing was resolved. I soon tired of Harriet's sullenness. Although the other characters were well written, there was no pay-off.If you have a lot of time on you hands, go ahead and try it, otherwise I think you should pass on this one."
5,Southern Gothic Meets Kids' Adventure Story,"This superbly crafted and beautifully written novel held me transfixed from the prologue to its wonderfully ambiguous conclusion. Tartt's wordplay is graceful and haunting, her characters are deep and fascinating, and the suspense sequences had me writhing in my reading chair. I cannot recomend The Little Friend highly enough!"
2,Disappointed with this book,"This book was too long for the story that is being told. The author likes to go into little nitty gritty details that aren't important to the plot or flow of the story. There are parts that are extremely entertaining, but then it slows down and I found myself skimming the pages to get through it.I really like Harriet, though. I wound up getting really wrapped up in her and caring mostly about her more than the other characters.And I was extremely disappointed with the ending. Don't want to give away anything, but for a 600+ pages book, the ending is not satisfying and I felt like I wasted a few days of my life with reading this book and investing time into it."
2,Anachronisms,"The observations that have been made regarding the need for some editing, as well as praise for the beautifully drawn characters in this book, are apt.I was tremendously distracted by, and had trouble suspending disbelief over, the inconsistencies regarding just when the action was taking place. In one summer, our characters watch Dark Shadows, see the Patty Duke movie of the week ""Me, Natalie,"" get in trouble for stealing Star Wars action figures, and call each other ""Dude."" 1969? 1977? 1983?"
1,nothing follows the good begining of the book!,"Don't lend that book to friends ... they'll be disapointed!I certainly was, and mad that I had paid money for a story that doesn't have a 'middle' and no 'end'.The story had potential... but it was wasted."
2,Future readers of this book BEWARE,"I actually enjoyed reading this book and I even dreamed of snakes last night . . . yuck! But where is the ending?? What happened?? Is this a joke? I'm wondering today if the author has another chapter, page, paragraph . . . anything that will ""end"" the book. If anyone ""gets"" the ending please explain it to me! I wish I had known there was no ending before I began reading the book."
2,"Too many words, too little thinking","This book would have been served well by some serious editing. Unnecessary, tedious descriptions did not add to the plot, characterization or interest of the story. I did not find the text particularly well written, and so the extra words were not enjoyable. Often times, all that was needed was the first and last sentences in the paragraphs. I found it excessively boring and depressing. Things only marginally came together at the end, but overall the ending was unsatisfying, mostly because none of the characters seemed to change (except the ones that died) or grow."
2,Immensely unsatisfying ending,"Just finished this one. Let's just say that after reading 625 pages of a novel where the little boy gets murdered on page 1, it's hugely disappointing and appallingly cheap not to FINISH THE STORY and let the readers know who committed the crime.I would have given this 1 star, but Tartt is a good writer and having grown up in the South I thought her dialog was true-to-life. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I also agree that the book would benefit from some serious editing. How many descriptions of the trees do we really need?"
2,I agree...,"with the above negative reviews. I finished the book last night and could barely slog through the last 100 pages. Where's a good editor when you need one? The book detoured into too many directions with an unbelievable resolution. I thought Tartt left behind her original premise of Harriet's solving the murder of her brother and went into a writing frenzy about rednecks on speed. I loved The Secret History, but was disappointed by her second effort."
1,Letdown,"I just need to agree with all the other reviewers who awarded this book just one star. I DID manage to get to the end but only because I thought such a novelist deserved commitment. But it was such a disappointing read. It's a book that starts well but quickly fades away and leave the reader quite bewildered. I agree with others when one seriously wonders if this is the same author who wrote The Secret History. Luckily I borrowed it from the library, so didn't waste my money."
2,I'm putting it down now,"As an avid reader and having recently read ""The Secret History"", I eagerly looked forward to this novel. Ugh...I'm 300+ pages into and really have no investment in the characters or how they evolve. This exactly why I decided to skim other readers' reviews. Thank you! Perhaps one day in the distant future I will pick up the book again...but at this point it seems a laborious task and a waste of time..."
2,Very disappointing.,"I have never written a review before but I felt the need.The end of this book just infuriated me. Every critic that proclaimed this book to be ""amazing"" must have been high. I didn't mind the 600+ pages or the endless descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells. I actually enjoy a long book with attention to detail. However, I did mind the many hints that pervaded the book that never seemed to go anywhere. I felt that Tartt was tired of her own book towards the end and,instead of investing more time and energy into it, through it by the wayside. I just wish I had."
4,Long? Yes! But who wants a good book to end soon?,"Unlike this book, I will keep my comments short. If you're looking for an action packed thriller, this is not the book for you. However, I enjoyed it for its marvellous, descriptive use of the English language. Reading Donna Tart is like admiring a richly woven tapestry. Her writing pulled me right in. I felt myself physically transported into the place and time. To be able to accomplish such a feat is a true gift on the part of the author!"
2,Worthwhile chunks floating in a distended mass of words,"In 1992, Donna Tartt published The Secret History, an overly-praised piece of well-written juvenilia which generated much undeserved hype. A decade passed before her second novel, The Little Friend, came out. Like her previous work, this one starts out on a promising note, with pages dripping of Southern Gothic and parallels with To Kill a Mockingbird. Unfortunately, the narrative drags on way too long with pointless detours and false starts before much of anything really happens. Although there are some interesting regional caricatures, what this text needed most was a fearless and honest editor. At least now we have a five letter word for ""over-rated."""
1,The only mystery is the hype - WHY???,"As the other reviewers have already noted, this was a tiresome, detailed, lengthy read - and, that was only after reading 1/3 of the book. The prologue was great, but, the rest of the story just dragged on and on and on..... In my long history of reading, this in only the second book that I just couldn't finish..... The only reason I stayed with it for 189 pages was so as to not hurt my husband's feeling on his choice of a Christmas present - he was mislead by all the hype also. Don't bother with this one."
4,Big character development smack-down!,"With this book Donna Tartt simply throws down the gauntlet on character development. This, her second, book was a long time coming and you can see why...these characters have been simmered and cooked down to the kind of flavor meld of a spaghetti sauce that has been on the stove all day.As a voracious reader I am so happily suprised when a book like this falls into my hands. It's long, the story is compelling, I adore the characters, and I lose DAYS to reading.Harriet easily makes it to the top of my alltime favorite hot 100 characters. I highly recommend this book.Be forewarned if you have a small child that the first part of the book is definately a punch to the gut. But don't let it deter you -- it's fiction, and it's a fantastic book."
1,Tartt lays an egg,"Alfred A. Knopf publishers really deserve to put a warning label on the jacket of this deathly dull dud of a novel: CAUTION MAY INDUCE SLEEP! They also should be held liable for their outright misrepresentation of this book as a thriller/mystery. It is neither. But I guess they need to lie in order to make back their money. Tartt seems to have gotten carried away with the sound of her own pen - she writes in longhand apparently, though it doesn't make this book any better - but too much of a ""good"" thing is truly bad. Tartt can't make up her mind whether she's a commercial authoress or an academic. I hope she goes for the former and not the latter! Yuck."
1,Mystery Unsolved!,"Why I bothered to finish this book (when I didn't even like any of the characters!) is a mystery to me... as is the ending of Tartt's book. I guess I hoped that Tartt would form some kind of dramatic conclusion or surprise ending. But the only surprise was that there was NO ending and the mystery was never solved! I'm sure not going to hang around for a sequel. As a lover of literature, I usually come away from any book with at least one good thing to say. After ""The Little Friend,"" however, all I could say was, ""I just read really bad book!"""
2,Book Hurled At Wall,"I am not surprised by the fact that the professional reviews of this book are competely opposed to the reader reviews. I really doubt if the professionals actually read the whole book. If they had, they would have thrown it against the wall in anger just like I did. I did not expect a typical detective/mystery story, but I did expect a couple of answers at least. The characters are superbly realized, but a story can't be all character and no plot. And if an unsolved murder is the propelling basis for your whole book, you darn well ought to provide some ideas about whodunit. Book is lying on carpet, pages ruffled, will make a good hefty doorstop now."
4,How it is like Secret History,"The Little Friend has a similarity to Secret History in the underlying sense of dread that builds as the plot progresses. I got right away that this book was not going to be about solving mysteries or revealing secrets..it's more of a coming of age story. Although I was a little disappointed in the ending at first, after thinking about it, I realized that the ending fit better with the overall tone of the story. The satisfaction of this book must come from an appreciation of Tartt's language. I found myself re-reading passages just for the pleasure of it. Her ability to draw character is such that I really felt like I got to know real people, living in a real place. I look forward to more from Donna Tartt, she is a major talent."
3,Endless Good Writing,I loved her use of words until it became never ending. It seems the plot just petered out.
1,I give up,"I've only waited six years for this book to come out - since I got around to reading The Secret History kind of late in life, after it had already been around (and I resisted it for years) - but still, that book blew me away when I finally dove into it. The Secret History's a true masterpiece of storytelling and mood. So. How can I accurately convey my feelings about The Little Friend? Sadness. Disappointment. A sense of being let down. Also a feeling of concern for the author. Was she bullied into cranking out this false new book? Shockingly little of The Little Friend rings true. It's all grinding and machination and hard work that doesn't gel. I don't believe that Tartt's heart was in it. I almost couldn't finish it, and when I did, it left me empty. With a feeling of having been duped. Where did Tartt's magic go? Or was it all a beautiful fluke to begin with, too good to be true?"
2,A little let down,"For the first 50 or 100 pages of this novel, I thought that I was going to enjoy it more than The Secret History. I thought the characters were wonderfully vivid, especially Harriet and Hely. But as the book went on...and one...I got lost, and lost interest. The novel's climactic scene drew me back in, but the ending was extremely disappointing. I like novels that don't wrap everything up neatly, but, seriously, I thought the last few pages of the novel had been ripped out of my book. It just ended, leaving me wondering what the point of the whole book had been. Although The Little Friend is well-written, it lacks something to hold everything together."
1,Who Done It?,"Do you think we'll have to wait another decade to find out who did it? This isn't really an online review - another one wasn't necessary given the accuracy of 99% of the other reviews already provided by customers - it's just a plea for some information. When I skipped past about 350 pages to read the final chapter, it was to break the boredom and find closure to the suffocated plot. I was blown away when I didn't find it! Unbelievably, I actually had to backtrack and skim through the 350 page quagmire to find it, only to be disappointed again. I was about to poll some friends who I know are reading the book, but was too ashamed and afraid to admit that I missed something so obvious. Kudos to Amazon for printing so many reviews, they helped validate the disappointment....Looks like we need an Afterword from Donna Tartt to clear this up - but I can't hold my breath that long!"
1,We've waited ten years for THIS?,"""The Little Friend"" is a 250 page story in a 550 page book andthe publishers should be sued for leading us to believe that this is a mystery, which is not. Look, I loved ""The Secret History"" and a lot of Tartt's shorter work. Her ode to Willie Morris is one of the most touching things that I've ever read.But, this latest thing is horrible.About the only thing that I can appreciate about the book is herdead on sense of Southern dialect and dialogue. Other than that, nothing. I hate the characters and I suspect that she's not really crazy about them herself, ambivalent at best.Sorry. Maybe in a another ten years she'll come with something that will be worthy of her time and ours because ""The Little Friend"" is certainly not."
1,what a shame!,"""The Secret History"" was so great what a shame that ""The Little Friend"" is such a nightmare. I was so aggravated trying to read this mess that I had to get rid of the book as fast as I could! It's the most boring bit of crud I've ever read! Do NOT buy this book!"
1,Never had so much been written with so little said.,"With the exception of the first 50 pages and last 100 pages, one could tear out handfuls of this book and not miss a thing. I kept waiting for the book to ""get going"" but it never did. On and on it goes w/out any character development (Harriet, Edie, Hely..). Minor characters given major relevance. I kept reading hoping for some advancement but it never came. The ending is less than satisfactory but is just that: an ending. My time to read is at a minimum, sorry to say feel cheated on this. For some reason, I expected more."
2,Add me to the I-Gave-Up list...,"Southern Gothic fiction is ordinarily my favorite, and I really wanted to like this book. However, after 150 pages of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING happening, and all the reviews I've read that say nothing ever does happen, I'm giving up on it. Call me one of the masses that don't understand great literature, but I just don't have the attention span or patience (same as with Faulkner... I tried and just couldn't stay with it.) I may pick it back up later and give it another try, as the language and characterizations are wonderful (the aunts all remind me a lot of my own family.) But I have a stack of other books begging to be read, and life is too short!"
1,Disappointing denouement,"I agree with all of the negative reviews.. read Tartt's first book many years ago, loved it. I finished this one and wanted to heave it across the room. While Tartt is unquestionably a talented writer, this book lacked cohesive structure (I'm an English teacher). Where was her editor? Did he/she actually read the whole book?"
2,Could've been half as long,"The text on the back is misleading - this is not really about a girl solving her brother's murder. It starts with a family torn apart by the loss of a young boy, and one of the consequences is the neglect of his younger sisters. It's not until 150 pages in that one of the sisters then decides on who the murderer is, and that she will kill him. It's not until the family of meth heads enters the scene that you really care about anyone at all, and Tartt makes her descriptions so detailed that you can get a lot of the content just by skimming. It was interesting enough to read to the end, but the ending didn't really give me the satisfaction I had hoped for."
5,No sure why people don't love it,"I am in disbelief as to why people don't love this book. I am almost done with it, and I am so sad that it is going to end soon. If I have to wait 10 more years for another book by Donna Tartt, I will. Her writing takes my breath away. The ending is heart-pounding good. Please give it a try and make your own judgment."
3,Not the best for power users,"On the very positive side, the switch was really simple to set up. However, it doesn't work correctly with Win XP Tablet edition (mouse will go crazy and, if you have a monitor on the tablet that can switch from portrait to lanscape, it will always startup sideways regardless of your settings). Also, doesn't support the Apple key on a Mac -- but does work fine with Mac otherwise. Can be annoying for power keyboard users because the hot keys for switching are automatically on and anytime you press Ctrl twice it prompts you to switch (but, other than that, it's really great on Win XP Professional or Win 2000 machines). I'm still using the switch, though, for lack of better options ... it's better than being without one. And better than the competitors I've seen."
1,Stick with these reviews,"With this book I would stick with the baby name web sites that I mention in my last review or my most favorite baby name book... The Name Book: Over 10,000 NamesTheir Meanings, Origins, and Spritual Significance"
2,very dissapointing,"This book is nothing more then a collection of photos. no how-to or process content. Poorly edited. Here is a sample from page 16(notice the repetition and use of courtesy four(4) times: ""A thin veneer of concrete was treated to give this kitchen its ultra-contemporary feel, with the dramatic use of acid etching. The deep colors acheived by this process added depth and dimension . Coutesy of Courtesy of Action Concrete Services thin veneer of concrete was treated to give this kitchen its ultra-contemporary feel, with the dramatic use of acid etching. The deep colors acheived by this process added depth and dimension . Coutesy of Courtesy of Action Concrete Services"
5,Good play.,An unusual and interesting play. As I am about to take a playwriting workshop from Lee Blessing this was doudbly interesting. Good play for community theatre.
5,X men and wolverine,"great quality and sound, get a good home theatre and live the fights there, ha ha"
2,2nd X-men movie stops at one particular scene then stops playing,"I purchased this X-men Trilogy Blu-ray set on amazon.com and the 1st X-men movie plays fine and the 3rd X-men plays fine...the 2nd X-men movie however freezes at this one scene then when I try to skip that particular scene the sound stops and the can't get it to play. I ordered a replacement from amazon.com 2 days later the replacement set came in...and I'm still having the same problem with the 2nd X-men movie, it just freezes at the same scene. I haven't even tried watching all the extra discs either, I'd hate to see how any of those freeze. I know there's a possibility of a ""bad batch"" sold but I don't know how many times I will have to replace them until I find a set that I will actually enjoy to watch without the headache...for the price of blu-rays I expect the quality to be great as well as the actual product itself to be great."
5,X MEN ON BLUE RAY,"Initially did not like the X men , with the origins doing its rounds and reviews i decided to boldly pick up the Blue Ray set which made me revisit my liking to the X MEN saw the entire series in reverse which with the quality and impact only a Blue ray can do to you did to me. A worthy collection, the special bundles thrown in along with this 9 pack disc is awesome. Another noteable feature is to see the depth of Hugh Jackman maturing with each movie in leaps and bounds, i am sure 2009-2010 will see him emerge as the top 3 heroes in Hollywood"
1,Blind Date Turns Bad,"I love Carl Hiaasen and Tim Dorsey's novels and had expected a lot from S.V. Date. What makes Hiaasen and Dorsey so good is that they can take the absurd real news stories and turn them into believable thrillers. Date is a very good writer buts to often resorts to tricks to resolve problems. When reading good fiction, the reader needs to suspend belief and become engrossed in the story. Date has created a tale that is so unbelieveable, with so many co-incidences to get his characters out of trouble, that I lost my belief factor and interest."
2,don't order more than 1 until you are sure it is what you want,"While I can't say why, the activated carbon was unusually dirty (gritty). When washing in a fine strainer it was quite dirty, and a significant amount of the volume was lost. I suppose it is possible it was end of production lot and therefore more composed of carbon dust than most. I've switched to another brand."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"i had recently purchased a link cable in hopes to trade pokeon games with eachother, but the first link cable i bought off amazon did not work. so i bought another cable and when i got it in the mail, i was exited but when i opened up the envelope, it was the exaxt same cable just a different color. neither of them worked."
5,A fun and suspenseful read!,"If you're in the mood for a who-dun-it that you'll never figure out, Face of Justice is a blast. I just got into the mystery/suspense/court room genre about two years ago and Blum is a very fast paced, keep the plot twists coming kind of read. I hope there is more of David Nova to come. How about Nova and (new) family leave L.A. for a holiday that turns summer suspense? Don't keep us waiting too long."
4,An excellent tripod,"The two aspects of tripods that have always confounded me have been the clip in mechanism that secures the camera to the tripod, and the positioning system, usually two arms that twist. This tripod has solved those dilemmas. The ball positioning system is slick, quick, simple and stable. The clip in mechanism is quick and simple; but it's a bit tricky and takes some practice.Bear in mind, my cameras a medium sized digitals, not full force SLR digitals with monster lenses.Bottom line: this is the best tripod I have ever owned, and would buy it again."
3,Stable tripod for light equipment,"With an interesting hexagonal leg profile, an average ball head, a decent carrying bag all in a fairly light package, this tripod may be consider by the owners of a SLR-like or point-and-shoot cameras who want a quick buy. But again, if you care about how much weight you carry with you and care less about quality than practicality, why would you spend over $100 for something significantly heavier than your camera. Needless to say that who has an SLR and is looking for a tripod, they should keep looking. Here is a short comparison with other two tripods: http://anonimu72.blogspot.com/."
1,Never worked right,"I bought this joystick over a decade ago at a Lechmeres that was going out of business. Unfortunately all sales were final, or I would have returned the product. I could never get the spinner to work, and only got to use the actually joystick portion. I since bought several saitek joysticks which work much better."
2,Not worth the novelty value,"The videos for many of the songs on this CD are easily found on Youtube so unless your kids (or you) find some songs you really love you're probably better off passing on the CD. The title track is really the only one that is particularly catchy. The Cookie Monster song is almost creepy.Interestingly, the LP version has a few ""Beetles"" songs like ""Letter B"" and ""Hey, Food"" which didn't make the CD."
2,Handbook of adoption,"This book disappointed me. The authors did not make enough reference to recent scientific literature. To complete with the recent meta-analytic reviews like:van Ijzendoorn, M. H., & Juffer, F. (2006). The Emanuel Miller Memorial Lecture 2006: Adoption as intervention. Meta-analytic evidence for massive catch-up and plasticity in physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive development. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47(12), 1228-1245.An integration of psychoanalytic and empirical data would have been great.-A Psychology Psy.D.-Ph.D. student."
2,Disappointed,"I normally LOVE the Firm workouts. I own many of the dvds. However, I was disappointed with this particular workout. Alison's routine was good, Allie, Emily and Rebecca's routines were well choreographed, but not challenging enough. And Annie definately needs more practice/experience as an instructor. She seems nice, but was very difficult to follow."
4,Specialty recordings with two Vee-Jays,"[Based upon Amazon.com ""Sample"" audition]The 12 Specialty session tracks sound fine; the two, later, Vee-Jay tracks are LR remakes of ""Ooh My Soul"" and ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"".""Ooh My Soul"" is the very abundant 1964 version, a different sound for Richard, a Latinesque beat, but it's clear his voice is not in shape. ""Shakin'"" is Richard's first release on Vee-Jay, a regional hit, and quite possibly featuring Jimi Hendrix. Sound is muddy on this frenetic mover - but the performance overcomes such objections. One of the most exciting instrumental breaks in History!"
3,"""All I wanted was to kill you dead"" Wait, what?","""Lovegod"" is a fun album with no bad songs. Everything is catchy and everything rocks. I like the addition of found sounds and voices between the songs. By those points, it's a four-star album...But I gave it three stars instead. Call me a wuss, but I find ""Lovegod""'s lyrics disturbing. I don't mean to cast aspersions on the songwriter, and I know there's a difference between a songwriter and his characters, but a good chunk of these songs sound like they've been written by a psychopath. ""Softly"", ""Kiss the Gun"", ""Lovegod"", and ""Love You to Death"" all make references to killing, and ""Sweet Meat"" seems to be sung from the point of view of a shameless rapist (""And the world is on fire/I'm lost in desire/I'm on the corner/And she says no no no na na no. . ."").So if you're the kind to be easily bothered by violent lyrics, then be warned. Otherwise, ""Lovegod"" is a good buy."
2,Great Stones Cover Track and Little Else! Poor Sound Quality Too!,"Okay, I'll admit it: I bought this album because I liked ""I'm Free"" which I thought had a great groove and excellent wah-pedal guitar and then I found out much later that it was a Rolling Stones cover. So I thought I'd judge the rest of the tracks on the very short album which for some reason still sounds too short with the 2 bonus tracks added. I have to say that this album hasn't aged well at all and the sound quality is poor. Given the standard of recording that's out there today, if you want to do your stereo or even your eardrums any justice, I'd say pass on this until they remaster it; if they ever do. Nice psychedelic cover art though but this is essentially ""I'm Free"" plus 12 filler tracks. I'd recommend getting albums by EMF or Jesus Jones rather than this album."
1,"Only good for seasoning, not for reasonable quantity","I bought this grinder so that I can get fresh flax seed meal every time I need it instead of buying prepackaged flax seed meal from health food store. I was very disappointed that it works like an ordinary seasoning grinder. It is fine if you want to only sprinkle a little on top of your food. But, if you plan to get 1 to 2 oz of flax seed meal a day as recommended, forget it, because you will have to be very very patient and work hard too -- just keep grinding and grinding for at least 15-20 minutes. I think this device is stupid. Why charge so much? I can get a spice grinder for a few bucks. It is not designed for handling a reasonable amount of flax seed. When I set it to coarse, flax seed comes out almost intact. When I set it to fine, only bits come out and broken flax seeds are attached to the surface of the teeth of the grinder."
5,Very pleased,"Thanks to the reviewer who explained how to adjust the grinding mechanism, I have enjoyed using this comfortable, stylish grinder. I toast the flax seeds before grinding them to use in breadmaker breads. If you need more than 1 or 2 TBS, it's better to use a coffee grinder dedicated to spice grinding."
3,Too much Blowing!,"Get the Blackhawk concerts. Miles seems to have over-ingested Coltrane's angry bop, which bop made Cannonball say ""[that's] not the blues"". The point: when jazz forgets its roots, it becomes lost."
1,Not for a toddler,This is a very difficult book to read and understand. Had an early education teacher to read it as well and also agreed this is not a good book.
5,Great way for kids to think about Christmas,I had my 8 year old grandson read the book to his 5 year old sister at my home before we opened any gifts. It was the perfect way to bring the focus back to the real meaning of Christmas.They loved it and we will make it a a tradition from this point on.
2,Book is small.,"I had hoped this was a bigger book and was board pages, but it is a Golden Book with thin paper pages."
4,"FRIEDKIN STRIKES BACK!(Not that he ever left, you fools!)","After the critical lambasting surrounding the release of ""Jade"", and the lukewarm reception of ""Rules of Engagement"",'70s cinematic fireband William Friedkin once again galvanizes the soul with ""The Hunted"", an impassioned duet, an Oedipal wrestling match, a primal struggle that is his most audacious visual tapestry since ""To Live an Die in L.A."". Under his stellar direction, Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro sizzle, stab, and scorch into an immortality of devastation, in this brimstone biblical tale of a soldier who wants to die like a soldier. You'll walk out of the room with grit on your face, having watched this filmic equivalent of a Johnny Cash song from a director who knows God, murder, and the evil that men do."
3,Fun to Watch,"I enjoyed this film.Interesting story, that has been done many times before, but is done again here in a way thats entertaining.If you watch it worrying about weather someone could actually do these things you won't have fun. IT""S FICTION!!! IT'S A STORRRY!!!If you like macho action flicks, in a woodsy setting you'll like this film.And a note to the animal nut one to two reviews before me. Their animals---they would and could kill and eat you. The only thing we have to worry about is managing resources so the last as long as possible for our use."
1,What A Dissapointment,"You'd think with two major stars (Tommy Lee Jones & Benicio Del Toro) this movie would work, but these two guys have absolutely no on screen chemistry whatsoever. But, they are not totally too blame. The plot is very weak, meandering, and basically nonsensical. The chase scenes are typical Hollywood action cliches. This movie was billed as a suspense drama, but the only suspense I encountered was when it was going to end. Thankfully, Benicio Del Toro can be forgiven for this movie after seeing his marvelous performance in 21 grams. The same can be said for Tommy Lee Jones, as he did a good job in The Missing. As for William Friedkin, a once brilliant Director has now been involved in two stinkers in a row. Hopefully, his next project will be indicitive of the William Friedkin of the past."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"The fight scenes were a little bit hokie. Easy to follow movie but not very original.Not a bad movie, just not fulfilling."
4,Still A Great Movie!,"When this movie came out in 2002, I found it to be very fascinating because this was not the type of flick where the bad guy dies by a bullet to the head, this time around he was being sliced to death! Maybe I am a twisted individual for liking this aspect of the movie but I think there's something cool about it, especially for the reason that he hunts those who do the hunting-call in equalization. The movie also highlights the issues that plague soldiers when they come home from war. Most of them are scarred for life with visuals of death and destruction and the mindset of killed or be killed is hard to shake...hard to turn off if you will and this movie exploits that. I loved this movie when it came out over a decade ago and I can still appreciate it."
5,Tommy Lee Jones at his best,"An action show that will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. Filmed in Portland, OR adds to the beautyof the scenes. I would recommend this to men and women that love adventure at it's finest."
1,Absolutely horrid!,"I have to admit that I enjoy Arnold's movies and even like the ones that are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO UNREALISTIC like Commando. But, this one was absolutely horrid. The plot is lame, the action is lame, the suspense is lame, everything is lame. It was terrible! Arnold plays a firefighter bent on revenge after his son and wife are killed in an explosion. And of course, he kicks but. Anyway, I own this terrible movie and think about throwing it out of my window a lot. It's horrid!It's not interesting, boring, repetitive and there is no suspense. Oh my gosh! Is the terrorist attack going to work? Of course not because Arnold the firefighter will save the world! I hated this terrible movie!"
1,"Arnold might be a nice guy but,,,,","I find it funny that no one has ever heard of the team ""Collateral Damage"" until Timothy McVeigh use it, then Hollywood in all it's wisedom uses it to made a movie. I think Arnold is a nice guy. He's worked very hard getting to where he is but he's no actor. He's good in the blow-them-up type of stuff, but if you want to see a movie with a story or with some substance this isn't the one to see.I give the movie credit for sound and the physical indurance of Arnold, but i rather be getting a route-canal."
1,"Wow, how far has Arnold fallen?","What an unbeleivable piece of garbage. Aside from cameos by John Leguizamo and John Turturro, this film was an unbeleivable waste of time about a fireman attempting revenge for the deaths of his family.This is a feeble attempt by Arnold to relive his glory days when he was a box office draw.The release was pushed back due to the events of 9/11, but this movie is so bad it should have never been released."
5,"(2) Great Movies, For the price of (1)",You can't beat it with 2 of Arnolds action pack movies (Brand SpankenNew) for the price of one. Excellent Product and Super Fast Shipping Too!!
2,"Retirement, always a good option","Badly acted and offensively timed, ""Arnie"" needs a retirement plan. Action was weak, and left this reviewer remembering September 11, 2001. Does anyone remember 'Last Action Hero' and how all of the promotional material needed to be returned and redesigned due to the basement bombing at the WTC? I think perhaps this movie should have been shelved and unreleased based on that previous experience. I fear the release of 'Terminator 3.' Buy it if you collect, avoid if you don't"
2,not really Blu-Ray quality pic,"decent movie, but pic was only a little better than normal DVD, but did not approach Blu-Ray quality. If I had known, would have saved a little by buying the normal version of this."
1,Schwarzeneggar's WORST,"Do not see this movie. I made the mistake of paying [...]to see it in theaters and it was the worst investment I ever made. All I was hoping for was a no-brain, high-octane, extreme action-adventure movie with some one-liners from Arnold, a la Commando or, at best, Predator. But this movie could not even be a ""good-bad"" movie. It is just a bad, bad movie. The scenario is completely implausible, the dialogue idiotic, and the final sequence ridiculous. There were a couple explosions but no really good action sequences in the whole movie. Man, Schwarzeneggar has been bad before (End of Days) but this is terrible!"
4,Pleased by quality and price!,"It is definitely more of a white wash than a glossy white paint but I felt that the assembly was easy enough and it is quite sturdy. We already placed the order for the matching desk and dresser for my 6 year old daughters room. I may decide (in the summer) to paint it more of a glossy white to match her existing bed but I will decide that once we recieve the next order. For this price, I 'm not expecting perfection nor do I plan on it lasting her through college. It was definitely purchased for a shorter period of time. But, for the price, I am quite pleased with the quality."
5,Best Pick - For Sure!,"I bought one of these last year for the summer. As a person with a ""odd"" figure - I wear a size 7 but still am a ""D"" cup - this bra was a God-send! I have never been able to wear strapless bras because 1) they never come in 34 D, and 2) because I'm smaller around, they always slip. Well, not this one! Also, it sits at the perfect height for you to be able to wear tank-tops and not have it ""peek"" out around your arm-pits or in front. I love it - and own it in every color!The one I bought last summer I still wear - and I wash it in my washing machine and dry it in the dryer (in a lingerie washer bag). I have bought 4 more since. I went on a search for these, in fact, after I bought the first one - and was pleasantly surprised to find them on here.These bras are wonderful - and have sold me on the Maidenform brand forever! =) Plus, they are way less expensive than any others you could find - and those wouldn't fit as well!"
1,One Fab Fit Strapless,Ow.And ugly under clothes.The search for a really good strapless bra continues.
2,Too Big and with zero padding,"the bra is not true to its size and since there is no padding, it creates a see-through effect under the sun"
3,Ariel doll,"I don't have this exact doll- I have an older version..She is ok..I give her 3 1/2 stars because her eyes are very big and when you first get her she might seen a lil' bit uhhgly. But.......she's alright..By the way i'm 12..I got the doll when i was 5.Later,Megan"
1,Ariel dolls are ugly,"I luvv disney princess but i hate ARIEL!!!!!!!She is always soooo ugly!!!! i got this doll for my Birthday and i opened it up and i hated it soooooooooooooo much that i pulled its head off right infront of my family and friends!!!!!my grandma cried because she had given it to me and then i had to go to my room and all my friends went home.(that was the only present i got to open, and i didnt get any cake or cards or wishes or nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!)so dont buy this ugly doll. its not worth the tears,the heart brokeness or the frustration, plus the lossage of a good birthday fun!!!!!!!Anna Maria"
5,awesome!!,this is the best highlight film EVER. it showcases the greatest player that ever laced up a pair of sneakers and is so inspirational that i watch it over and over again.
2,"Terrible, deeply disappointing","The fight scenes are bad; I'd always seen Sammo in his older-fatter days opposite Jackie Chan and thought: maybe he was better younger?He wasn't.There are only two things to recommend this movie (hence the two stars) --1) The 'fight' between masters early on is wonderful, very different from just about anything else I've seen in 30 years of ""bad karate movie"" watching; and2) The harm-to-innocents that occurs is.. surprising. Different enough to make you wish the entire movie'd been better to justify the thought that went into that bit of storyline.However, it's too much crud to sit through just to enjoy those two bits of pleasant surprise. Rent it if you must but you'll be sooorrrryyyy..."
4,Its better than I expected!,It is not greasy or thick. The scent is a bit weird at first but quickly disappears to a light Patchouli smell. I actually love it.
2,A leap of faith,"It used to be that physics was the king of science and everything else (botany, geology, etc.) was glorified stamp collecting. What has happened in Physics is that theories have become more and more outrageous and less and less open to verification or falsifiability. Anyone can come up with a wild theory about other dimensions, quantum weirdness, etc. and the rest of us are supposed to bow down to it. Just one question - where is the evidence? And if there isn't any or if there is very little of it or if the evidence is unobtainable because we are talking about events outside of time, the theories belong on Art Bell's fringe radio show and not in a science forum.A bunch a physicists arguing these days is just as much of a madhouse as a bunch of theologians 500 years ago..."
3,Interesting information but little light on relief.,Information on the history of Homeowner Association law in Florida is interesting and helps to frame the current status of the laws. It is short on what recourses an individual or group of homeowners are available to them. It appears that the developers win most of the time.
3,townhouse rules review,"THE BOOK WAS NO HELP FOR ME , I WAS LOOKING FOR RULES FOR THE ROOFS WHICH NOW I UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO RULES FOR THE ROOFS AND FLORIDA IS BUILDING MORE TOWNHOUSES WITH NO RULES FOR THE ROOFS.MY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT GET A NEW ROOF WITH OUT THE OTHER UNIT'S GETTING A NEW ROOF TOO. THE BOOK MAY BE SOME HELP FOR OTHER PEOPLE."
4,ROCK AND ROLL BOOGIE,"Although this is a relatively unknown effort it is one of the band's best from the 1970's. Hard rocking songs like the opening ""Shot in the Head""and a strong cover of Howlin' Wolf's ""Howlin For My Darlin'"" set a hard rock tone. Quieter and more reflective bluesy numbers like ""Love Me Please"" round out another very solid if ignored effort from the band. Kim Simmonds is in fine form and remains one of the great blues guitarists of all times and sadlyalso remains virtually ignored."
2,Strange. Very Strange,"This was without a doubt the weirdest book I have ever read. I assumed this would be a romance but it was more of a mystery as to the details behind a childhood accident involving the main character, Cady, and her childhood friends and enemies. Her grandmother seemed almost like she had multiple personalities and her ""friends"" were not truly so. The most distrubing part of this book was the death of one of the secondary characters. I truly didn't like any of the characters in this book and finished it wondering why the heck I wasted my time reading it to begin with."
1,"Boring, unglued and alltogether not worth the price","This is one of the worst novels I've ever read! The characters are not exploited, the plot is scattered all over the place, and the dialogue is SO BORING it was only by sheer willpower that I turned the last page. Cady Johnson appears as a silly introvert heroine that, with only one visit from a designer, changes her looks, her wardrobe and her 20-year long fears and attitudes, and turns out to be witty, adventurous and interesting. If only! Boomer, the wanna-be hero, comes out of nowhere, with a life-long love for Cady that has been hiding in his heart and comes alive after just once glance to her renovated self. Please! Save yourself a lot of deception and skip this one."
5,Best Seller,"I just know this book will make the best seller list. It has love, humor, sadness, mystery...all the ingredients for a best seller. How could it miss??? The author had my attention from the first page to the last. It was one of those books I couldn't put down or go to sleep until I finished reading it. It was a truly wonderful book and I hope I don't have long to wait for another great book by Fern Michaels."
4,No Smoking Gun Here!,"I bought and read this book in 1987, about 2 years after it was published. It is no longer in print because, it is outdated. If you want to know what the state of Vertebrate Paleontology was in 1985 this was a good reference for the interested layman. It presented some of the areas where further research was required, that is 'the problems' in Evolution. Research since the 1980's has filled in many of the 'gaps' in our knowledge that this book presented. It was well illustrated with the appropriate diagrams and drawings. We know a lot more about how Evolution works but not everyrhing. I still have it and still peruse it every so often because it is interesting to see not only what scientists got wrong back then but also what they got right (i.e., new evidence has shown them to have 'guessed' right)"
3,Beware...,"Not being a die hard Camel fan I bought this record on the basis of the reviews and (pleasant) memories of listening to Camel some years ago. Indeed the first of the two CDs lived up to its expectations with a fine selection, including a personal favourite ""Tell Me"" (although I find the vocals on the Mirage tracks a little difficult to stomach). The real disappointment came on the second CD, paticularly from the fourth track onwards - it's hardly surprising that Camel disappeared off the radar screens. Frankly, for all the virtuoso guitar it sounds like hundreds of other ex-prog rock bands that produced pap in the 80s. Bit depressing really... Wish I'ld spent a little more and bought the originals (esp. Snow Goose, Moonmadness and Raindances)"
2,money better spent elsewhere.,"if you like somewhat mellow, mood inspring progressive rock, cd 1 is worth listening to. if you like 'hall and oates', cd 2 is your listen. whichever you like, you will be frustrated with the other disc - better spend your money on either the first camel albums/cds or on hall and oates or the like."
2,A good performance recorded poorly,"This DVD dissapointed me by the fact that the recording quality seemed very flat. The louds, particularly the 4th movement, didn't seem much different from the softs. I'm sure that it was an amazing performance, but the recorders don't let you listen to that performance. Another thing that bothered me were the cameras. They never seemed to focus on the important section of the orchestra. They also focused way too much on Karajan. I know that he is important, but not so much that the orchestra isn't. If you want to listen to a good recording, listen to his CD, or my preference is the Chicago Symphony recording with Daniel Barenboim conducting."
3,Good Book - needs some editing,"I really REALLY like this book. Most of the recipes are wonderful...some aren't. But the book is worth its price for the ones that are, and for all of the good information. The recipes have a break down of nutritional facts, but I have noticed that some of the computations for the amounts of proteins, carbs, and calories etc. are WAY off. Also, some of the recipe instructions have been unclear and/or inconsistent...(for example: ""Rubber Chicken"" and others) leaving guess work followed by some frustrating moments...especially if one is not keen in the kitchen. My advice....buy it, but read over and understand the recipes before diving in."
1,Confusing,"I am a fast reader, but this book took me a month to finish. It was so boring, I could only read a page at a time, and then I'd read another book in between. And it was confusing to me. The woman in the nursing home, her nemesis, did she have a daughter? She said she did, then I don't remember the daughter ever surfacing. And all the boring stuff about the foundation and domestic violence and wanting to investigate it. Yawn. The whole thing seemed unlikely and mind-numbingly dull. It will be some time before I read another Lippman book."
3,"good for the table, not for cooking","I give this grinder 3 stars because the idea is so darn clever... adjustable grind size, and both salt AND pepper in one device. It's kind of fun twisting from the salt side to the pepper side too.Unfortunately, all the complaints of output amount are true. I find that almost no salt comes out unless it's set to the coarsest grind. I can get a fine grind of pepper, but again, it just creates a faint dusting. When I seasoned a pot of mashed potatoes, my hand got so tired that I had to ask someone else to finish grinding.Also, I'm not sure exactly how it works, but it seems to leave a lot of what's been ground inside the chamber, which means I don't get 100% freshly ground pepper, thereby defeating the entire point.It's not TERRIBLE, but I plan to keep this on my table, and get another, more functional grinder for the kitchen."
5,Heartfelt,"I was extreemly moved by this picture, and was able to relate to it very well, with joy and tears it gives hope."
5,Magnificent!,"I'm not a Catholic and have never read a history of the Catholic Church before and I was mesmerized by this book. Kung's clear and brilliant -- because the Church was among the most important prime movers in world history in the past 2000 years, this is an enthralling history of world events from a very interesting and important perspective. A real eureka! book. It's going to be read again and again."
3,Kung's Catholic Church,"Hans Kung doesn't seem to me to possess the passion-free virtue of the true historian. The Catholic Church represents both God and the Catholics. If everything in the world would be assimilated into the Church, it would have no constitution, in fact, no existance. Mexico City."
1,Wow....this is crap!,"Wow...this was total crap. So much bias, anti-Catholic, and much of it isn't true at all. I can't believe this guy's a priest. I can't believe this guy didn't leave the Catholic Church yet. God have mercy on this priet's soul."
2,Too long...,"There was a decent, two hour long made-for-tv movie inside this 4 hour long ""miniseries"" somewhere... which is why I give it the second star...The original ""Andromeda"" premise still holds up (or would, given the right script, actors, and director) so why add all of the meaningless subplots? We certainly could have done without the intrepid investigative reporter, and a few hints, rather than a long story arc, would have satisfied the government conspiracy angle. Kudos to Benjamin Bratt, Ricky Schroeder, and Christa Miller for making the best of what they were given."
1,"Bad Writing, Really Bad!",The person who wrote this movie:1) Never read the original book and got how great it was2) Never saw the original 1971 movie and got how great it was3) Just doesn't get Sci-Fi4) Can't writeNuf Said
2,Poor Acting Abounds!!!!!!!!,"Wow, its been so long since some of these actors have done anything, I think their talent is rusty. Aside from the hokey premise of the movie, I couldn't get passed the poor acting. The gal from the Drew Carey show, aside from having some bad plastic surgery, was terrible. I have seen high school actors who were more convincing. Ricky Schroder (now he's back to ""Ricky"" instead of Rick I guess) was pretty bad as well. This thing was 4 hours on TV. What a waste of time.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS LOSER!"
1,Bad Remake,"What dreck! It starts as a decent remake and descends intoliberal TV hell. They took the (excellent) Michael Crichtonnovel and added the evil government, even more evil military,the brave (drug using) journalist, the noble environmentalist,the insultingly obligatory gay soldier... I think a pointcan be made, but they don't bother to use any of these thingsactually improve the story. It's almost like they went througha chacklist of liberal crap and squeezed in everything on thelist. Spare yourself the 4 hours of inane gibberish and watchthe original. The additions to this one did nothing but addmore time to sell commercials! I consider this to be a nearperfect example of what's wrong with current entertainment."
3,Is she qualified/certified for this?,"I am not sure that Tracy Anderson has any qualifications to teach this workout. What concerns me is her lack of explanation. She literally says at one point ""now make sure you watch me and do this the way I do or it could really hurt your lower back"" and that is it! There is very little talking or explaining as she goes through these exercises, she doesn't instruct when to inhale or exhale (which is key to an ab workout) and she doesn't mention keeping your abs contracted to support your back, don't pull on your neck when crunching, etc. I think that a pilates workout by a certified instructor (even via video)would be best for most people. I am going to continue to try this video to see if I experience the amazing results she speaks of, instead of a sore back and headache which I have from this now."
3,not quite there...,"This workout could be a great routine considering she has some great moves that really target and fatigue the muscles worked, but Anderson really needs to understand that the people doing the DVD cant really look at the TV the whole time, so some verbal cues as to when to change sides would be nice."
4,You Can Feel The Difference,"This video is wonderful! I had given birth to my son four months ago and have done so many other videos like Zumba and Core Rythms, which I loved but did not feel the same effectivmess as I did with the Tracy Andersons video. I still think this video would be hard to do for a woman who had their 6week okay from the dr. Some of the ab workouts are even hard for me and I was working out 4-5 days a week. That just goes to show you how I wasn't engaging all of my muscles from the other workouts. The only downfall is that I was hoping that it included some cardio, I guess that is where her dance cardio routine comes in (which I just purchased today)."
3,Pure hype,So I ordered this DVD sfter reading the reviews.My take on the DVD is though it is thin on instructions but still not very difficult to follow.By second time you get the moves but i didn't find it very challenging and didn't feel the burn.Currently I use perfect abs which has given me impressive results but I have plateaued so i was looking to get something else but after doing thid DVD a few times I think i will revert to Perfect abs.
2,Difficult!,"I had my baby 2.5 months ago & started doing cardio & some strength training but wanted something a little more challenging, so I purchased this dvd. This is very challenging!! I had a hard time with the leg exercises and found it to be more for someone already in shape, not for someone trying to get in shape after baby."
3,"Challenging workout, but I wish it was more user friendly","The workout is physically challenging, but it is also mentally challenging. Tracy doesn't count any of the exercises or inform you to switch sides. I find myself constantly having to look up at the TV (straining my neck) to follow along. It would be much better if she would count out loud or have a countdown clock. It would be impossible to watch my baby while working out (as suggested by Tracy in the video) because you really have to constantly be looking at the video in order to follow along. As new moms we are sleep deprived and mentally strained, the last thing needed is to get frustrated with attempting to follow along on an exercise video."
2,Just can't do it!,"My second baby is 8 weeks old, with her older brother only 16.5 months older (so 18.5 mos now). II just can't do this DVD - it is WAY too difficult. I wish she had someone in the DVD with her doing modified versions of what she is doing, because all of these moves are so painful. I am healthy and cleared for exercise, and I want to get my stomach back. This is just too much right now. Maybe in 6 months. I am going to try some easy pilates now."
3,"challenging for beginners, but I'm sure it will be very effective","I had to wait a while to get the product in the mail...after trying to order it several times (product was sold out--which made me even more excited about trying it). When I got it I opened it up, popped it in the DVD player and began the work out which I found to be very challenging for someone who just had a baby. I immediately felt like it would definately work...if I could perform the moves. For now, I am working at my own pace until I am able to perform the moves accurately."
3,"Not that exciting, but tough on abs","I did not believe that this was going to be the only thing I would need to do, but this will not cut it for the only work out. First, this would be challenging immediately after having the baby. For me, I was not doing much besides walking the last few months so this would be killer to do. Second, there is not a lot of instruction. You need to watch to understand where she goes next. With time you can anticipate, but I found that to be annoying for the first few weeks. Third, it gets boring over time. There is no real cardio to this, mostly an ab workout."
5,Love it! Great for abs!,My youngest just turned 3 but this video is great for those of us who still have trouble with their abs. It really targets the abs and the exercises are easy to do once you view it a few times. I started seeing results pretty quickly.
5,This video rocks!,"I was very skeptical about this video, however after one workout, my abs were incredibly sore and the movements are gently and easy so you don't know that you are getting the intense workout at the time. Make sure you have mats and 3lb weights, other than that it is all you!"
1,Quit working after 2-3 days,"We paid $16.95 for this can opener and thought it was pretty cool, it worked nicely for the first couple of days. (Our dog eats canned dog food so we open 3 cans a day on a regular basis.) Then it quit working. You can squeeze the handles all you want and it makes a click-click-click noise, but does absolutely nothing toward cutting the can's lid. We are returning it for a refund."
2,Get the self-titlet one!,"I bought the self-titlet CD first and really liked it. Even though there are a few bad songs on that CD, there are some of my favorites, too. Anyways, I bought this CD yesterday and I really am disappointed! I would say it is really for fans only, I am not a fan and I wouldn't buy it again. Get the self-titlet first."
2,Just OK,"We were a little disappointed in this piece of furniture. It is made of cheap wood and is not painted the brilliant white it looks like on the screen. The piece that hooks to the bedframe is not even painted. Very disappointed, but will have to do for a while until I can afford a better piece since I wasted my money on this one."
3,Refused Shipment,A friend of mine purchased a similar headboard. Once I saw it in her apartment. I decided it wasnt for me. Its overpriced.
2,Not for beginners,"I was intrigued by this video, since I have a dance background and have taken a couple ballet courses in college. However, I found the frequent ballet terms difficult to follow and the instructions lacking. Unlike ""normal"" exercise tapes, there was little introduction to movements and injury prevention (especially when working on back muscles). The tape was a nice change from my other tapes, and I did feel the workout, but I would only recommend this to seasoned dancers and exercise enthusiasts."
1,Want to return this,"I have purchased several excersice videos from Amazon, and this is the least favorite. I have taken ballet lessons, and learned the basics, yet stillI find instructions of this tape not informative enough. It tells what to do, but no specific explanation on how to do them right. It is in black and white, and very two dimentional. There's no encouragement, either. If you like ballet as I do, I'd assume you want to see the dancers in their most beautiful costumes and moves, right? If so, I don't recommend this. Instead I highly recommend Jennifer Kries's Pilates Target specifics. It is not ballet tape, but in one of four sections for thighs she uses ballet and she gives great instructions, encouragement, collors, and three-dimentional views."
3,Not so great,It's not all that easy if you've never done ballet. It's not as much fun. And I don't get the feeling I've worked off that double scoop of chocolate ice cream.
2,Not what I expected,"As a dancer, I expected this video to be a challenging workout, but unfortunately it is not that difficult. They watered it down way too much. If it is meant for exercise beginners, this should be clear in the title.My favorite part of the DVD turned out to be the biographies in the special options!"
3,"Not all bad, but not all good either.","I have been out of dancing shape for many years, and wanted to use a ballet dvd to supplement my gym workout. I got this dvd, and am really dissapointed with the quality of the dvd itself. Mine skips all over, will go from section 10 to section 14 and then to the dancers bios page. I have to constantly stop and put it back on menu and figure out where I was.Otherwise its a fun workout. I enjoy how beautifully its shot, and the classical music helps get you in the right space. It lacks standing barre movements, (I don't know what this floor barre is) and the instructor just drops out sometimes while the movements have changed and you have no idea.Overall I think its a good starting workout to get you familiar with terms and positions, but I would quickly move on to a local beginners ballet class."
3,"Good workout, but hard to follow...","This video provided a good workout, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I took dance lessons for six years when I was younger and I was hoping to get back into shape. It was a little hard to follow because of the editing and the pace was a little slower than I would have liked. It takes a good bit of time to complete the video."
4,Good full body workout!,"Well, I must say that I am truly loving this workout DVD. I think that the excercises are things that every person can do (even if it is not so graceful or flexible as the dancers themselves). I feel like I am working everything in my body and am enjoying myself! I've always loved ballet, so to be able to do the same workout as the members of the NYC Ballet is a unique opportunity."
3,If you think ballet is beautiful DON'T buy this,"This dvd's only plus is the biographies of the dancers in the end. I think ballet is beautiful, but this is NOT ballet. This workout is supposedly what they do to get in shape, and it is absolutely BORING. The narrorator's voice is too slow and announces what the dancers are doing, which is the opposite of what you should be doing. It's confusing. And, each section of workout is in a blank room that is visually uninspiring as is the music (classical). I did not listen to the critics of this dvd and I got it anyway. Bad idea. I am just glad that there were some glitches in my disc so that I could return it."
3,"Different type of workout, but...","If you want simplicity... Well this one isn't the one. Not to say that you won't get it after watching it a few times. The two reasons why I didn't like this workout is that the narrator (which I really didn't expect in a workout video)doesn't explain the moves in how to do them, when they are going to change up the sequence, leaving you to figure out when they are going to do what next by just watching. I guess I have been spoiled by Kathy Smith who actually tells you this is what we are doing, this is how you do it and this is when we are going to do it. It also didn't get my heart rate up.. Could be because I was to busy standing around trying to figure out the workout. BUT after bashing it, I would say that if you are looking to get something more from your regular workout, do this in addition. Nice for flexibility, toning. But I wouldn't rely on it as a sole workout. Gotta make me sweat!"
4,There's a method to it...,"I have read some of the other reviews, and noticed people saying that it does not do anything for you, and will not increase your strength. This is because it is almost neccesary to understand ballet before doing the program. However, the title is not ""learn to do ballet and workout"", but new york city ballet workout, so logicaly it gives you some forewarning. i personally was a little dissappointed in the frequent break up of the segments, but, over all, this is a very good for those who take ballet to keep their mind focused on their turn out and form while not in class. (the excersizes must be performed the correct way, or you will not benefit from it)"
2,the best part are the bios,"Sarah Jessica Parker's introduction is weak. And her hair is all hair sprayed and wierd. I have a bit of ballet experience, but the exercises are not explained at all and you're left just trying to match what they're doing on the screen without having any idea of proper form or even what exactly you're supposed to be doing. The exercises are not described per body parts, instead you have to figure out that some ab work is in the ""floor barre"" section, etc. This DVD layout is just a mess. Also, I don't feel that you do enough reps to really work out your muscles. The pictures on the cover and inside are stunning, and I thoughroughly enjoyed the interviews/bios of the 4 models. This DVD is best for glimpsing the life of ballet dancers and getting a rough idea of the exercises they do every day. Try a Method Pilates video, in my opinion you'll get the same long lean results without all this other nonsense!"
4,Great workout but...,"This is a great work out for stretching and flexibility. If you had minimal exporsure to formal modern jazz or ballet classes ,it is useful. With no exposure to dance classes,it may be too much too soon. My one complaint is the dvd itself, it only plays in my lap top."
3,Great workout,"The DVD really is great. It is a great workout and the stretching and warm ups are wonderful. The narrating is a little bit off and it is a little confusing but for the most part, it is easy to follow. SJP gives a brief intro in the very beginning but that is all of her involvement in the DVD."
2,"Great Results, Very Expensive",Thia is a great paper towel but very very expensive. Over half the usual price!!! OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!!!!!
3,Not Quite Top Notch Mystery,"Plot: Recently discharged GI Martin Folger becomes involved in a case of who-died-first in a car wreck he witnessed years before; his testimony could change the outcome of the inheritance battle between two powerful lock-maker brothers and the widow of a third brother, who died in the wreck. Trying to unravel the mystery of the wreck while avoiding being served to testify, Martin gets involved in more deaths and becomes a prime suspect just as he tries to start his new life as a civilian and also avoid falling for the possibly soon-to-be-very-rich widow.My review: An ok example of a golden age mystery more of the hard-boiled than cozy type. It's a little longer than it needed to be and unusual in that the murder doesn't happen for a hundred pages and it's not clear who to root for, the detectives or the hero."
1,lost years of my life,"just putting batteries in and closing it up made me lose years off my life. thankfully it finally broke, now I'm shopping for lights again."
3,"Awesome light, but measure the diameter of your frame tubes","This is a great bike light. It even comes with batteries! It has a clip built on so that you can clip it to your backpack, belt, or whatever. It also comes with two brackets that are supposed to let you mount it to the seat post or next to the rear wheel on your bike. Now, granted I've got an older bike (70's Huffy road bike, ftw!), but one would think that the brackets would fit the smaller diameter steel tubes. Nope! If only they'd shipped the light with an extra strip of rubber to wrap around the tube to make it wide enough for one of the brackets...."
5,Great Rear Light!!!!,This light easy to install and even easier to operate!!! I love how bright it is and durability of the light. Very impressed!!!
4,Bright and has two flash modes,"This Planet Bike Blinky ""3"" is all you really need for a rear bike light. It's cheap, it's simple and it's effective. It has a strobe mode and a constant ""on"" mode. I prefer strobe because it makes you more noticeable.There are no real flaws with this light although it may not be the brightest on the market or have the most blinking options or features. A lot of times you don't need those different blink modes, though, unless you want to stand out. The only person that is going to notice is another cyclist, though.As long as it blinks and holds a charge with the batteries for a good amount of time, it is a winner.-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games"
4,"It blinks and people see you, works great","Easy to install, easy to use, very visible. The rubber gasket used to hold the clamp on your post can be a little tricky, but if you are patient it will hold its place forever once you tighten it."
4,bike light,"Nice small but effective light for the back of your bike. Has 2 settings, solid and flashing. Very bright directly behind unit. Also has a quick release to take it off the bike. Not to sure how it will do in the rain being water tight but no problems yet."
2,Light fell off while riding,"I have a trek 1.5 and I mounted mine under the seat post. It was a tight fit, apparently my seat post is almost too thick for this light- it was a little hard to get on, but it worked.1 week later while riding a normal ride, I noticed the light wasn't staying in place- it kept lowering and pointing downward. I had to lift it up multiple tmes while riding and keep checking on it. Next thing I know, the light is gone"
4,The little extras are great,"Sure, the light is great, lasts a long time, and is easy to turn on while on a ride. However, the best part is the array of connectors they offer in the box to ensure you can clip this practically anywhere on your bike. It's the little extras that make this a great choice.Update: After a while, the battery would lose connectivity and thus cause it to go steady, then dim. It's due to too much room between AA batteries and plastic cover. I added some strips of duck tape to thicken it and the problem no longer occurs. Deducted a star for this."
5,The best bike tail light for the money,"I've seen all sorts of bells and whistles available on other rear bike lights out there, and while having a light that can flash in 10 different patterns might be amusing it's really not necessary. This Planet Bike light does exactly what it needs to, and nothing more. It's very bright so as to be highly visible on the road, and can be put into a repeating flash mode. Secures very easily to the seat post. I'm all about bargains, and this is an outstanding light for the price asked."
3,Low cost & long battery life but not that bright,"I ride a road bike in rural settings on the weekends for exercise and commute to/from work a few days each week in a inner city Houston, which is not that bike friendly, often at dusk. This light is acceptable. Good points of this light- low cost and long battery life. Its drawback is that it is really not that bright and not as visable as I would have liked for riding at dusk.I have since decided to add a second rear bike light to my commter bike (the half watt rear bike light also made by Planet Bike, which is about double the cost of this light but much brighter and more visable). I would suggest to other commuters and bikers to not try to save on their lights- spend a bit more upfront and get the best out there that is at least a half a watt. Your safety is worth the extra $10-15 to upgrade."
5,Great Product,The Planet Bike Blinky is an affordable 3-led light that has proven it's value during my nighttime riding. If offers both the solid lighting and the blinking lighting and I find the blinking lighting to be more noticeable. This mounting that is included with the light is very handy and offers a snap in feature so that you can take your light with you when locking up or bike or even have the option to mount it on your clothes or bag. I think this is the de facto for rear lights; if it can handle busy Austin traffic at 8:30-9PM it should suit anyones needs.
5,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do, and for a great price!",I bought this item based on its rating here and it did not disappoint. It's at least 2x as bright as my friend's cheap ebay tail lights. I liked it so much that I ended up buying a second one to put on my girlfriends bike! Definitely worth the dough!
4,Makes for a safer ride!,"Of course I can't see the light from behind when I drive, but I've been told the red blinking light is very noticeable which means cars should definitely see us. I ride with my toddler so it makes our ride feel a little more safe. The light also can stay lit your entire ride if you want that option."
3,I got mine autographed!,"This is the complete original Monster Mash album from the '60s by Bobby Pickett. It features his monster smash ""Monster Mash"" and a lot of other monster themed music recorded to fill out the album. To be blunt, most of this material is ""filler"". It is fun, silly stuff, but it's not great by any stretch of the imagination. I should mention that there is one bonus track added to the CD, which is the Christmas single ""Monster's Holiday"". It's a good CD to get for your Halloween party."
3,Could have been better for the price,"I just finished viewing the DVD and was totally surprised to find it to be a home video. For $43 a consumer expects more. $19.99 or less would have been a much more resonable price. I truly expected a hospital setting with vet on hand for the price I paid. The DVD comes in a plain clear case with no cover or attaching literature. You only catch a glimpse of the man holding the camera. I'm torn on how to write this review because I wanted to see a whelping video and I did. What I'm upset about boils down to the price vs. the quality. If the video was $15.99, then I would have given it 5 stars even with the shaky camera shots."
2,Not much information here.,"The cover claims ""A Practical Guide to Photographing the Night Sky"". The book is essentially a vehicle for displaying the authors' remarkable photographs. The discussion on equipment and methodology is shallow and incomplete."
3,Eh,"Nowhere in the description does it say that this poster had a white border around it. I wanted whats in the display picture, not the picture surrounded by a white border."
4,"Great Songs, but...","This is another case where a major record label tries to cash in on an artist who was dropped from its roster...Dan Fogelberg has written and recorded some of the most wonderful music Sony has ever released, but this collection will leave you wanting for more in many ways:First of all, the choice of only ten songs (where there would have been room for almost twice that amount) is disappointing. Also, this collection goes for ""hits"" rather than concentrating on ""real"" love songs - while interestingly also including a few choices about love gone absolutely wrong (from his brilliant ""Exiles"" album).""Portrait"", a 4-CD box set, offers a much wider variety of Dan Fogelberg material if you're looking for a collection as such. If not, go and buy his original albums - they're all worth the money!"
2,Lost Interest Quickly...,"I have been reading a lot of books lately regarding investments and finances. This book trips itself up on some kind of a political agenda (I have yet to figure out if the authors were trying to smear Republicans, Democrats, or both), so much so that I was completely distracted by what the authors had to say and quit reading after a few chapters. The political jabs were distracting and they made the authors seem less credible. The book had too much of a ""doomsday/completely hopeless future"" feel to it, it almost was painful to read, it made me squirm inside!There are many books out there that can offer a lot more help (and hope) than this one, if you are looking to secure your financial future."
3,Decent martial arts flick.,"Kickboxer's Tears offers a number of good fight scenes with many opportunities for talented women to display their martial arts prowess, which is really the only reason to watch it- don't expect too much from the story. The fights are quite well done, and it would have earned 4 or 5 stars instead of 3 if it wasn't for the full screen format, which cuts off a lot of the action- this is a movie that needs to be seen in wide screen format to be fully appreciated. Also, the Tai Seng release is English dubbed with no option for subtitles; the dubbing isn't too bad, but it still would have been better with subtitles. Hopefully the studio will offer a future release that corrects these deficiencies. I'd be willing to pick up a new copy if they did."
4,what a bang!,"have a few drinks with the few friends you are still talking to from the 80's. open the book and say anything. what a hoot!and ps, it's not war and peace -- it's a trivia book! cut it a break. i loved it!"
2,Needs the right conditions to work,"I really wanted this product to work. Its very well made - german engineering. The concept is great - nothing to drill in the walls.I read the other reviews, and understand why some like and some didn't like. I spent several hours over three days, and discovered that it depends on the surfaces you are installing it on (ceiling and floor). If you are putting this on carpet, with a textured ceiling - something for it to grab onto - it works. If you are putting it on a smooth concrete floor (in your garage, for example), or a smooth piece of wood (like in an unfinished ceiling in your garage), the stand doesn't grip tight enough and tends to move slightly. Under the weight of bikes, and with vibration from the garage door opener, it can fall over."
1,Unstable,"Had this for 15 months and this is not very stable. Maybe due to the seasonal contraction and expansion in my garage, the spring tension in the pole has given way at least 3 times, twice the stand slipped off the ceiling joist stud on its own. But once it is installed, it is great but if you live in a zone where the temps in your garage varies greatly with the season, watch out!!!"
4,Practicing now!,"I've been playing guitar for years and years. Have many books, CD's, etc. This is my first on ""shred"" techniques... holy cow! It's like I'm back to square one.. but that's good.. basic techniques are well presented in logical format. I was able to move through some of this fairly quickly, in theory, but still working on speed speed speed! Wish there was TAB for Vol.1, but I found that online. Vol.2 tab is included in PDF on disk. Would be nice if there was something to paly along with, it's presented and you're off on your own to practice. All that said, it's a good bang for the buck... plenty of good techniques and lessons to work on for a long long time."
5,Ultimate Shred Manual,"I have been playing guitar for more almost 20 years and I wish I had this DVD back when I was trying to develop my shred guitar technique. Couple this DVD with a book like Speed Mechanics by Stetina and you have all you need to start shredding. Paul is such a virtuoso shred player, he will blow you away with licks played at the speed of light!! He however slows all these licks down and even shows every small detail in achieving these licks from alternate picking, sweeping, sequences, sweep-tap, legato and more!!You will also need a metronome and LOTS of practice time to learn these techniques. When you master them you won't regret it since you will playing with terrifying technique.If you want to play like Paul Gilbert and other master shredders out there, this is the DVD to start with. And for this price you can't go wrong."
4,This one IS a 'cherry',"Cherry Lips (Go-Baby-Go!) is probably the best crafted pop song ever produced. This import features the studio version found on their album Beautiful Garbage, so nothing new there.The so-called 'b-sides' Enough Is Never Enough and Use Me are both just excellent. It boggles the mind that these two songs aren't getting heavy radio play. I'm constantly impressed with Shirley Manson's voice and how she can match the different sounds/flavors of the band's superior musicianship and production on each song.The remix of Cherry Lips (the last of the four songs) is the only weak spot on this cd. Not because it's bad or anything, but musically it's just so stripped down (instrumentally) while doing almost nothing new with the vocals. If you're going to remix something, then REMIX it. All of it! That's just my opinion...If you like Garbage, -even if you already own Beautiful Garbage, get this cd. The two b-sides are worth it."
4,ORIGINALLY-SCRUM-DILLY-LICIOUS!!!,"ANCIENT DREAMS BY CANDLEMASS IS A VERY ORIGINAL ALBUM WITH SOME VERY INTERESTING STUFF! SONGS LIKE ""DARKNESS IN PARADISE"" CAPTURE YOUR ATTENTION AND THE IMAGINATION! LEIF EDLING, MATS BJORKMAN AND LARS JOHANSSON HAVE NO PROBLEM GALLOPING AT FULL THROTTLE OR CHANGEING TEMPO TO A MORE TRANCELIKE STATE, WHILE FRONTMAN MESSIAH MARCOLIN KICKS IN SOME WELL-TRAINED VOCALIZATION! IF YOU'VE THINK YOU'VE HEARD IT ALL, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THIS ONE A TRY!"
5,Keaggy's Best Album Ever,"This album is now 13 years old. Even though one of Keaggy's earliest efforts, it is his best. There is a little bit of everything on this CD. Rock, blues, folk, and country. One listen to Find Me In These Fields and you will know why he is considered one of America's great guitarists."
3,Interesting ideas but you need to suspend belief,"This book is an interesting compendium of a modern prophet's ideas. The best part of the book is Scallion's story of how he became at first a reluctant and then a willing prophet. He is a leading proponant of the idea that the planet Earth will be subject to massive changes in the near term future. The book covers his ideas on how the cosmos operates, how he gets his visions and a description of the predicted earth changes. People who follow New Age ideas will find much familiar material but some new. For me, it took quite a suspence of belief to follow Scallion's ideas. The true believer may enjoy it more."
1,Spectacularly wrong predictions,"My mother gave this to me in 1998. I looked here to see what it's worth. I just want to say there is a section with predictions through 2012 and they are most amusing. California slides into the ocean, World War III breaks out, etc. Much hilarity. Too bad he was serious about it."
5,heartstrings will be pulled,"vlt's anthology is a great combo of stories, although bachelor father is somewhat far-fetched with the ending."
3,B etter Than The Best,"Pretty good 70s blues rock if that's your thing, frankly, although I didn't find the album all that appealing I thought it superior to their greatest hits package, for whatever that's worth. Recommended to fans of Juicy Lucy or early Jethro Tull. Love the cover art."
1,JUNK,I ordered this item along with the nightstand for my daughter's room. Her &quot;new&quot; room was supposed to be a birthday surprise. When we received the items the day before her birthday we opened the packages and were VERY disappointed with the poor quality. The pictures are VERY decieving! The furniture is a piece of junk!
1,is not the original CD,"I've had 2 copies of this on Cassette years ago wore them both out. The song's ""The Creed"" & ""Beyond Belief"" on the original recordings are hard rock not guitar versions. I really would love to order this CD again. BUT THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDING!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Heaven's on Fire,"It's been a long time since I've listened to this album. But if I remember correctly, the song ""Seen and Not Heard"" bears an awfully strong resemblance to Kiss' ""Heaven's on Fire."""
4,Is a very informative research book for John Deere buffs,John Deere Buggies and Wagons tells of the history of the Reliance Buggy and of the partnership of the Deere and Webber Co.'s. The drawings of buggies and the color and striping details has helped us with our carriage restoration projects. It's a good one to add to your library.
5,Good stuff,I'm taking Bainbridge for Business Associations so obviously this book is crucial. It's a great summary -- very concise and easy to understand.
3,Haunted House?,"This story is about Jenny Blair, who gets signs of creepy stuff when it's about to happen, and this turns out to be real when her brother gets very ill on the vacation and needs to be taken to the hospital for treatment. Jenny and Chris accompany Jim, their older brother and Emily, their older sister to go home. But then they get caught in a very bad thunderstorm! so their forced to seek refuge in an old house. They think its an old hotel. But a family lives inside. They agree to take them in until the storm passes. But what they don't know is that the house is supposedly haunted by Andrea Cliff, who they hear calling out in the night. But is it really a ghost that is coming to haunt them, or is it the owners playing a prank on them? Well their going to have to figure this mystery out if they are going to escape this house, or they will remained trapped in the house forever!"
2,Bad Remaster,"What a disappointment. This was my first Bob Marley purchase. The actual music sounds enchanting; but I can't get past the tape hiss and distortion of the base & vocals. This particular cd [EXTRA TRACKS] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] bills itself as being ""The definitive remasters"". This reissue was supervised by Bill Levenson and Maxine Stowe. Bill and Maxine should be ashamed of themselves. With digital technology the tape hiss and base & vocal distortion could have been cleaned up. Bob Marely was (and is) a music legend. He deserves better."
2,Catch a cold,"2 1/2It's just average to me. Debut significance and any innovation credit aside, almost all tracks here are just forgettable in their basic similarities compared to his next few years when he and the band hit a creative stride. The traditional sound remains, although mainly butchered beyond stereotype in most cases with luke-warm songwriting and sterile backing vocals. A few tracks that crept out to land on further compilations obviously pointed at deeper melodic strength which was to come. Fans undoubtedly embrace this as early gospel, but those looking around as a starting point would do well to steer clear."
5,Perfect!!!,"I loved every second of this film. I can't imagine how anyone could not like it. It's funny, full of talented actors esp Sam Neill. Thoroughly entertaining!! A great buy."
3,BONHAM CARTER & NEILL????,"This is a true waste of talent! Talk about horrible flicks, this is a prime example! The only reason why I even BOTHERED to finish watching this film is because of the excellent acting of Bonham Carter and Neill. A complete no brainer comedy about the extremes in revenge. Good sleeping pill."

5,Savoy Brown lives,"This album was absolutely formative for my discovery of blues. Along with Jeff Beck of the Truth period, the Youlden-Simmonds combo defines British blues-rock in my memory of the era. Kim Simmonds raw yet tightly mastered Fender had a way of taking up residence under your skin. Chris Youlden's tortured rasps and growls resounded like the last cry of a man who has just gone over the precipice. Not bad for a bunch of English blokes.Although Youlden never resurfaced, and the others went on to a sort of suburban notoriety as Foghat, Kim Simmonds still tours under the Savoy Brown marquee. Watch for him and catch his act. It's still the blues and it's still sweet."
2,disappointing,"I don't know if it's age or recent political ""reconversions"", but this latest ""rant"" entry is neither as biting or funny as his previous releases. On his most recent appearance on Leno (January 20, 2006), he showed when he isn't lauding Dubya or the war, he still shows signs of humor (""As a nation we're getting fat...if you're built like a tank, don't wear the top"").But in this book, even the non-political rants don't have the bite as they did in ""I Rant, Therefore I Am"" or ""Ranting Again"".Perhaps, if he writes another ""rant"" book, he could do one on his experiences on ""Saturday Night Live"", since he was noticably absent from the ""Live From New York"" book. If Jay Mohr can do it, Dennis can...and he may just recapure my respect.Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."
5,Great Item,"Got this for a Christmas gift for my daughter at her request.Looking forward to see her artistic ability grow.Fast,fast shipping.Great seller."
5,Great gift idea,"My nephew loves to sketch and draw, these pads are great cuz you received three different types of paper. Packing was neat and shipping was fast"
5,Very nice..,"These sketchbooks are just awesome! I bought them for my daughter and she absolutely loves the hardbound sketchbook, but she also loves the other two sketchbooks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sketchbook. The shipping and handling was great. The sketchbooks shipped earlier than expected."
2,You can't learn how to script here!,"I have a specific need. I tried to learn how to implement it via AppleScript with this book, and the other leading book in the field, and frankly you can't learn scripting from the books in existence now. I am really frustrated with the poor documentation available for Applescript. I gave two stars because there is SOME information here, but extracting it is very difficult."
2,"Nothing new here, folks; move along.","From the warmed-over Velvet Underground reference in the title (and what the hell is she trying to say by using the word ""inferred?"") begins the parade of cliches in this book of mediocre faux-documentary photography.To wit; Yale graduate student photographs other self-absorbed New York types pretending to make love. Heavy emphasis on recycled Nan Goldin archetypes. Other photographers do this better, but now that Goldin's off the wagon I guess everyone's trying out for her spot in the limelight.Check out Letinksy's site at the University of Chicago for a laundry list of over-chewed postmodernist discussion about romance and photography. Heavy use of the term ""informed by"" should tip you off that this is just the waking embodient of an academic's wet dream."
4,Possitive,The company sent all as it appears in the offer. no complaint about it. I recommend it widely. Very good.
4,"Beautiful Music, but make sure you watch the movie","Cry, the Beloved Country, is a score that you have to get after you watch the movie MORE THAN ONCE. I have made this mistake with this CD. The theme which is played throughout the score, is one of pure beauty. It borders on the line of being played too much, but it deserves to be played a lot. The problem with the CD is the other music on this CD didn't help paint a mental picture of the film. At least not in my head. And I dont necessairly fault the composer John Barry for that. It is because to have that picture in your head, you must watch this movie multiple times. Unlike other movies, it is key to have watched the movie. If you do, then you will be treated with this fine work by John Barry."
4,interesting book from many reasons,"I bought this book in nearby ""One Dollar Store"" since I am a host of Polish Website. I was interested to see what the author has to say about Eastern Europe and also what the Peace Corps members think about their experience.It is an interesting read. The book is divided into several chapters depending on the country, so there is a chapter about Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovakia.Each country has several stories based on the experience of different Peace Corps members. The most dramatic are stories of these who work in Romania and take care of the homeless or sick children. In the other countries the Peace Corps are mainly for English teaching and for helping with building enterpreneur/business-like spirits.One can learn about life in these countries through their experience.It is really quite interesting read. It is a pity that the book is relatively old, since it talks about early 90s and there were many changes since this time in Europe"
4,CATALOG ERROR - NO BONUS TRACKS,"As of March 2005, this CD only has 10 tracks, not the advertised 16. I've ordered it twice and both times I got a 10-track version with a pink cover: Castle 06076 81189-2 (2002). Amazon customer service said they think it's a catalog error. I searched the internet trying to find a 16-track version, but never found anyone who actually had it. As far as I know, the 10-track version is the only one that actually exists. If you know where to find a 16-track version, please post a ""review"" on here telling us where to find it!By the way, the music's awesome (to my post-punk loving ears); don't let the lack of bonus tracks discourage you from buying this CD!"
5,Great French House!,"Although this CD is over 2 years old I recently bought it and I am totally loving it as it is an awesome CD. Every track one after the other is beautifully produced and laid out. There's something about French house music and electronica that I can't get enough of. From Dimitry From Paris, Daft Punk, Cassius, Bob Sinclair and a slew of others that keep producing wonderful dance music that have retro feels to them. I especially love Give Me Something (Deep In My Heart) with the great vocals of Barbara Tucker on this album as well as the title song and Just For One Day (Heroes). Anyway check out the album and go buy it.SJwww.bestplaylists.com"
4,Roseville price list,"This small paperback is great to carry along while ""hunting,"" but it does not include pictures. What is so good about it is that it's cross-referenced by both pattern and number. So you can look an item up by number if you don't know what pattern it is. I could have just missed it when purchasing, but I did not see a publication date. The copy I got was copyrighted in 2001, so its price list is not too helpful."

While this recording is a true document on how far-out a three piece can get with spontaneous improvation, it will do a number on your ears and it may take a couple listens to finally get into it.4 stars.My vinyl cost $16.99 + tax.Find it here on cd for $8.99 I do believe."
2,Solved the problem - was able to connect to the router (2 stars were from my previous review) NOW 555 stars!!!,"my old review ""I think it depends what type of router you use: this adapter showed 100% connectivity, but still failed to open the Internet Explorer, siting some troubles with the router! I had run the CD (did everything correctly), but I still cannot use it. Have to use my old adapter...""EDIT: After upgrading the router and its firmware, this little adapter is WONDERFUL! Full 5 stars - just great! The range is amazing - I was able to detect some free wifi networks - and this little adapter was able to connect to them even if the signal strenght was 10-20%. Of course, the house network shows a steady 100% signal strenght (all 3 floors), indoors and outdoors. Very reliable!"
3,"Disappointed, not what I expected!","Ok, from the other reviews, this album sounds great. I was highly disappointed after hearing it though. I read a review where Paradise Motel sounds like Twin Peaks meets Portishead. I don't know why, but that's not what I heard. Not even close. Except for the first song, the rest of this cd just didn't grab me. I actually grew bored listening. Also, I found it very difficult to find any of their other stuff. I didn't want to get ""Flight Paths"" orginally, but gave in, when I couldn't find their other music."
1,Guide to Mint Errors,"I have never received this item yet even though it was ordered 7/23/07,it is not here yet."
2,Fade into dissapointment,"I bought this CD to replace my vinyl copy because I love the music but when the last song (Hellbound Train) was re-edited into a cop out fade out ending which shortened the song by almost 2 minutes I was dissapointed. Whoever did this did't get what it was all about. Aside from this, it is a good album but not as good as the original. I wish they would have faithfully reproduced this album."
3,No Book is Completely Useless but Some Come Close,"This is one of the first books I read on Transsexualism and, fortunately, I did find other books which were far more useful.It does provide a good historical narrative and bibliography of what early TS story and theory were. But it's basically a treatise that fails in its goal, unless its goal is very anti-trans."
5,gets better with each listening,I picked this CD up without being familiar with Nestor Torres. At first I loved the renditions of Watermelon Man and Smooth. Eveytime I listen though I come away with another favorite track. Besame Mucho is performed so beautifully here. This is truly a fabulous CD and I am so glad I discovered Nestor Torres' music through it.
2,There is only one reason to buy this record,"Sinead O Connor's version of ""Sacrifice"" is absolutely sublime. It is possibly the perfect vehicle for her haunting voice and far far better than Elton John could ever do. A must for any Sinead lover. The rest of the album pales into insignificance, apart from perhaps the Beach Boys rendition of ""Crocodile Rock"" although this is mediocre by Beach Boy standards."
3,I ordered the wrong size,I ordered the wrong size but it is well made and someone would need it. It is to much trouble to send it back.
3,Pleasant but uninspiring,"I took a chance on this one and frankly my expectations have been disappointed. I was hoping for the big churning sound of samba bands full on, with the sort of drive and exuberance that Carlinhos Brown brings to the party. Whereas most of the stuff on this album is ""mellow"" and meandering, yet another take on bossa nova and MPB.Maria Bethania has a wonderful husky voice and there are a couple of other intriguing tracks that I'll fillet out, but in my collection this CD gets filed under ""Forgettable"".Anybody looking for a taster of Brazilian music, I would suggest checking out Sergio Mendes's ""Brasiliero""."
2,Samba Brasil,"Not the best Brazilian music CD I've ordered, I have the remaining two-of a series of 3 and this time I was dissapointed."
5,Let's Dance,"Fantastic ""The whole house is dancing"" This music takes me back to my years of visiting and living in Brazil. The music is life!"
4,Very good Rock/Boogie-woogie action,Guitarist Kim Simmonds leads the band to an interesting array of tunes with tasty style and vocals.
2,COUPLE OF REGULAR GUYS -- Yeah Right!,"The most horrific thing about this book is its title. My assumption in reading the reviews for this book (and reading its title) was that it would tell how some regular guys built the Home Depot from scratch, starting with an idea and building it into an empire.Instead what you get is the CEO and CFO of another home improvement company starting Home Depot along with an investment banking friend that lands them in front of a potential investor that happens to be a billionaire (Ross Perot). Somehow they don't seem like just regular guys anymore.The information in the book is okay, but it was really hard for me to get past this outrageous title that is nothing more than a lie. There are better business books out there on how to start a successful company from scratch. Try Sandra Kurtzig's CEO: How to Build a $200 Million Company from the Ground Up."
1,Dont' bother - it's not worth the stress,"This knitting machine shows pictures of a purse and other fun things on the box. How to make the purse wasn't even in the directions. And it was very confusing and difficult to make the other items. We tried to make a flat panel following the directions, but it didn't work as explained. We ended up making three tubes and by the third one, we finally figured out how to sew it so that it wouldn't unravel. All in all, a total waste of time. The kids were disappointed and I was frustrated."
1,Another Roseart piece of junk!,"My daughter received it for her 8th bithday; t looked like it would be fun. We were able to make a tube, but when we looked at it, we realized that the machine had dropped stiches so it looked like it had ""runs"" in it. When we tried to make a flat piece, it also kept dropping stiches. We finally unravelled the whole thing and are bringing it back. I gave it 4 stars for educational value, because, like another reviewer below, it's important to learn that packaging and commercials are just pretend and can override the actual quality of what you're buying."
1,More ROSE ART GARBAGE!,"I got this for my daughter for a Christmas present. It jammed up after assembling it. It is, with out doubt, complete trash. Rose Art used to be a good brand. Apparently someone has bought the brand name and figured that prison labor in China will somehow translate to quality products. More than likely, however, they just decided to turn out junk without a care for the brand name or the people they would be ripping off. This is not the only Rose Art product I bought - every other one I bought was broken or defective in some way. But this is the LAST time I buy anything with that brand name I guarantee it."
5,Mesmerizing and Intense,"Another great work from James Horner. This soundtrack both enraptures the listener with its sweet flute then catches him off guard with a bang and rumble of drums that will pound down your hallway like the stampede from the movie. I love this soundtrack because it seems to capture most perfectly the sweet reminisce of better times from our fanciful, and cherished younger days."
3,clouds water.,"Trying to save a few bucks i decided to try this product because i have goldfish. I used the reccommended amount listed on the container. I rinsed it with water FOREVER, but still cloudy gray black dust released no matter how long I rinsed. I added it to my tank.....my goldfish started defecating black. It all finally settled into the gravel. Then a month later I decided to add some plants....my gravel vaccuum didn't get deep down in the gravel....the cloudy gray water didn't go away after two 75% water changes with a gravel vac. I had to dump and scrub the whole tank. I don't think I will do that again...went back to regular store bought filters."
2,Great idea...if you add super glue.,These clips worked great for about two days before the sticky pad gave out. Add super glue and and they work the way they're supposed to.
2,BORING!!!!,"I got a gift certifacte for my birthday and have been snatching up a few of teh KMFDM cd's I like. So i figured that this could be a lot of fun as well. Skold isn't there, and only after buying the cd did I realize he was out before the tour started, so I can only blame myself for this. But the song selection I can pick on KMFDM for. Also, the lack of power in some of the songs is very prevalant. DIY rocks, but the live version has no energy. Sturm und Drang is the best song on ATTAK yet it is incredibly weak, and the best part of the song is ruined by a crowd that didn't even participate in a ""KMFDM"" sing a long. very upsetting. ""Dirty"" is performed pretty well, and the song Boots recieves a pretty good performance, but overall, I should have picked up a different CD."
5,GREAT PRODUCT - GO FIGURE WHY THE DISCONTINUED IT,"I bought at least 25 of these bars, and then they came out with a ""Deep Clean"" scrub bar which I liked a little better. Unfortunately, I only bought about 8-10 of those bars. The next thing you know, they've discontinued the ""deep clean"" bar entirely and now they have gone up from $6 a bar to $11 a bar for the regular bar. Since I hate using a washrag, this bar comes wrapped in something like a washrag that neither molds or gets dirty, and is a fantastic product. Unfortunely, only women will pay $11 a bar for soap, and I won't. I guess when I finally use up all of my soap, I'll have to find something else. This was a GREAT product, and I have absolutely no idea why they would have discontinued the ""deep clean"" bar or jacked up the price on the regular bar. If they ever go back to charging $6 a bar for the regular soap, I'll buy at least a dozen. This is by far the best man's soap I have ever used, but $11 a bar is simply too much."
1,Collection of trivialities boringly written,"The main idea of this book is straight-forward: why wouldn't developping countries export branded goods instead of raw materials, to get sustainably richer. Then it is followed by the numerous recipes and guildelines how to do this from a person who clearly has very vague understanding of the modern commercial realities.The text is heavy and boring often overloaded with not relevant and not linked details. I expected the section with the real life cases to be interesting and motivating. However, the cases are given on very generic level.Despite the well-known author, the book is a collection of trivialities. Government policy parts are stronger, unfortunately the author focuses more on the export business development"
1,Maybe I didn't read close enough??,The picture appeared to be a CD - obviously I didn't read through to realize it was a cassette tape - can't even use it. But I guess it was my mistake!
3,Title,The book was okay. I liked it because it had my favorite characters in it: the Outer Senshi. I liked it enough to want to order SuperS #4 though. I would really recommend this book if you like the Outer Senshi!
2,This blows,"As much as I actually do like Van Morrison, his vocal on Comfortably Numb was enough to absolutely ruin the entire recording for me. I think I've heard better vocal melodies on a Slayer album. He's not even singing half the time, he's just speaking the words--and when he does try and carry a tune around his now half-octave vocal range, it's as atonal as a symphony of tortured cats.While this is the major low point on the album, there are many others which try and compete. I don't know, maybe it's my too damn serious prog-rock background, but I had to cringe when Cyndi Lauper came out and destroyed 'Brick in the Wall'. The original Wall is a magnificent recording, a true work of art, as is the recent 1980 live release. This ablum is a circus of then-popular late-80's stars not at all doing justice to Roger Waters' brilliance."
3,A fleeting glimpse of brilliance,"Ok, we don't need Bryan Adams. Ok, we don't need Cindy Lauper. Nevertheless, we need to listen do this album. Try to listen beyond those moments I mentioned (and beyond a few others as well). You'll perceive a magical ""Mother"" interpretation by Sinead O'Connor. And a awesome and chilling ""Bring The Boys Back Home"". And even, if you can let go of Gilmour's vocals on the studio album, a very interesting Van Morrison led ""Confortably Numb"". Try it. All you have to do is let some walls in your head come tumbling down."
1,"Great songs, bad engineering","I like all the songs on the CD, but I can't listen to it. I've got the limited edition numbered version, and I'm assuming the music is the same across the different versions that came out. I like Howard Jones enough to special order a limited edition disk, so I'm not slamming him because I don't like him. He's just taken the louness trend that ruins most of today's pop and rock music to such an extreme that I can't listen to the CD.To be more specific about why I don't like the CD, the music has been compressed so much that there are no dynamics left. It's compressed even more than Perform.01. Put another way, the CD is too LOUD! There's so much compression that I can easily hear distortion and crackling in some of the tracks.If you like being intimate and involved in your music, forget this disk. This CD is loud and in your face, and too loud to enjoy listening to by a long shot. I don't like being shouted at by anyone.Chris Hudec"
2,Skip it.,"If you have never seen the original Alfie, you would probably like this remake a lot more. Sometimes you just don't know what you're missing.However, I am a fan of the original Alfie, and I was most uncomfortable watching this DVD -- just resenting the fact that it's OK, but not the genuine article.Sorry, I just didn't love it."
1,very bland film,this film didn't do a thing for me at all. it was suppose to be funny but it left me tired.too many cameos&whatnot that just had it all over the place.also I'm tired of all the re-makes can't folks come up with something Original??nothing moved me in this whole film whatsoever.
1,I wasted 2 hours watching this stupid remake.,Zero stars for the remake.Six stars for the original 1966 film.
2,Doesn't Score up to Michael Caine's Original ..........,"This remake might have a few things going for it, though I can't pin point what it would be.I thought it was unjust and dull compared to the original 60's version and found myself disappointed , bored and deep in thought of how great it would be to star Michael Caine in it again.Michael Caine as an older bachelor still up to his old tricks. I even got to thinking how he and Shelly Winters could have another go at it.but as I watched this dull, dreary remake , I realized there's no going back in time."
3,Pretty Good Shoujo,"I liked ""Kare First Love"" alright. It wasn't bad, just average.I thought the story was pretty cliche. The hot guy falls for the girl-who-looks-ugly-because-she-doesn't-dress-right-but-is really-pretty. And of course, there's the obligatory rotten friend who's jealous and tries to screw up the girl's chances with the guy.Characters were ok. Pretty standard. I had mixed feelings about Karin. She's the pushover type with no self-esteem, but I did think that the way she really thinks about things was funny, and showed that she wasn't a complete loser.The art's good. Karin looks satisfiably geeky in the first part of the book, and she's beautiful later. Actually, pretty much everyone in this manga is beautiful. The environments are done well too.Overall, you should read this if you don't have anything else, but there are better Shoujo titles like ""Hot Gimmick"" and ""Peach Girl"". ""Kare First Love"" is just mediocre."
4,cliffy,I'll be honest. I would have the 9th book in your hands before you read the 8th. the cliffhanger at the end just really makes you unable to wait for the next ohe so if youve already got it then you dont go through the torture of waiting!!!
2,One toke under the line,"There is some good music here, but very little of it is psychedelic, or, as the illiterates who produced it spell it, psychadelic.There is a piece by folkie Glenn Yarbrough, and, unbelievably, ""Chewy Chewy"" by The Ohio Express.If you want a sample of how varied the pop music of the '60s could be, interlarded with some songs that never were popular but are, nevertheless, not bad, this might hit the spot. If you want psychedelic music, pass on by."
3,DECENT,"Assorted Phlavors debut was a series of good ballads mixed with so-so uptempo songs. The lead single ""Make up your mind"" is a slamming jam featuring Big Daddy Kane. ""Hiding Place (featuring Patra) is another good uptempo song. The rest of the uptempo songs dont leave any lasting impressions.The strength of the album lies in the ballads. ""Trust"" has a seductive groove and the vocals are just as alluring. ""First you said"" is another love jam that would have been a hit had it been released. The funky groove takes you back to the days of Keith Sweat or Guy. The biggest misstep on the album though is a remake of LTD'S ""Love Ballad"". It does not fit the group and clearly they were not up to par to perform it.A Decent group of vocalists, but with the amount of songs it should have been more consistent. Another album maybe could have done them justice."
2,This is REALLY disapointing,"I have to say guttermouth have realesed some KICK [..] albums in their career but this is absolute [..]. I dont know what happened to them. The only reason that saves this from a one star is track 2 and track 9. THey are the only songs that are half good on this cd, but there rest is pure lifeless pop [..]."
5,Thrash Excellence,"Persistence of Time is without a doubt my favourite Anthrax album. Recorded in 1990, it proved to be the last full album recorded with singer Joey Belladonna.This is a fantastic album- track after track of raw, angry, defiant hard rock. All killer and no filler. The songs are all good, but I particularly like ""Time"" and ""In My World""- two gloriously cynical and angry songs, full of heavy riffs, powerful percussion and emotive lyrics. There is comic value in ""Got the Time"" (a cover of the Joe Jackson tune), and a relief from the metal onslaught in the instrumental ""Intro to Reality"". Anthrax's lyrics indicate that they reject the evils of society like racism and corruption, and embrace proud defiance against them.If you like Anthrax, thrash, or just heavy metal in general, then this is a MUST HAVE. All of Anthrax's work is powerful and driving, but this album sticks with me more than any other."
5,Classic Specialized Review,"Product was exactly as described. If one is not concerned with current value of stamps and covers, an older catalogue will do. This increases the value of the catalogue while lowering the cost. The price paid for this catalogue was well worth it."

1,Dream Sketcher,My daughter who is 5 received this item for Christmas. She was so excited when she opened it. She wanted to play with it immediately! We thought the quality of the screen was POOR. I felt like the images were hard to make out. We are DEFINITELY returning this purchase.
1,This is absolutely the worst toy,"I purchased two of these and two cartridges for my children for christmas and they have been nothing but a hastle. They worked fine the first day but not since. I have gone through a ton of batteries as well and have actually had a few explode in the unit. Bottom line is that I would have rather spent my money on the pixter or a leapster than this piece of garbage. I cant believe that Disney would want their name associated with this ""toy""."
1,Don't waste your money,"My daugther saw this toy in a catalog and we got it for Christmas, she was really exited, but after only 3 days the toy would not start; we replaced the batteries and then the screen froze. We exchanged the item only to get the new one behaving the same way. This time I'm getting my money back!!!!"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I bought two Dream Sketchers for my daughters this year for Christmas. Christmas Day they were fine and, yes, I was very surprised that they took six batteries each. By New Year's Day, both of the Dream Sketchers were burnt out. I have returned them for my money back. They are very expensive and you would expect them to last more than a week. Please listen to all of the people who have reviewed this toy and have said the same thing - DO NOT BUY IT."
3,Where's Hurricane Live 1 & 2?,"Besides the subtitled problem (i prefer listening in japanesse anyway... I've watched them so much, i know what they're saying hehehe), the one thing that made me angry was the set didn't include the Hurricane Live videos. The videos are important because they go into how and why Linna, Priss and Nene joined the Knight Sabers. Otherwise, it's damn good, go buy it."
3,Good system but...,"Well, overall I love my 360 to death. Unfortunately the first one I had fried due to overheating. Thankfully I had bought the Gamestop 1 year replacement plan with it, and took it back & got a new one. Well, the new one did even better than the first one, but the new one started freezing occasionally. I went to Best Buy and bought the Intercooler cooling fans that attatch to the back of it, and it runs like a charm. Listen to me and listen to me well: IF YOU BUY THIS CONSOLE, GET THE INTERCOOLER FANS WITH IT OTHERWISE IT WILL OVERHEAT!!!!!!Other than the overheating & freezing, this is a great console. Highly recommended!"
1,Xbox 360... This is a junk console!,DO NOT BUY THIS CONSOLE!!! TALKING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE!!!This is the second time I have to return my console for guaranty! This is not acceptable! I treat my console well and it fails again! This is a waist of time an money! I really do not recomend to buy this console to any one until Microsoft correct all the problems!I will return it again and sell it to buy a Sony or Nintendo one!Pablo E
3,BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY,"Gift for my son. Didn't buy the hard drive, etc because he can buy that stuff himself. I DID buy the warranty. My other 2 sons own these and both have had overheating issues.Also, use a separate, small, plug in fan to help keep the unit cool. Do not buy ANY ""Cooler"" that plugs into the unit.Think about it; You have an electrical item that is overheating. HOW is something you plug INTO THE UNIT THAT IS ALREADY OVERHEATING going to help? It won't. It will use more power and cause further overheating. This would account for the number of reviews I've read saying that the plug in cooler melted into their system. Also, good luck getting Microsoft to honor any warranty, regular or extended, if an off label peripheral caused a problem.An external fan, using its own power source works much better.Oh, and shame on a company like Microsoft for even making this something we should have to worry about."
2,3 RED LIGHTS!! 3 RLS....The Microsoft way.....,"I've bought an XBOX 360 in September, serial number 111625561706, and now it's dead.GOT FRIED!!I've had followed all rules 'bout overheating and all that stuff. Bad luck, i can't play anymore.Thank you Microsoft! Thank you for selling me 4 months of fun at the reasonable price of USD399+USD99(wireless adapter)+USD60(wireless controller), plus some titles.I believe that if you buy it, be prepared to enter the lottery of the 3RLs. And pray not to win.Pedro Franceschini"
4,"it has its uses, not for everyone","I'm a college student and the last thing I need to do is to be hooked on video games, so with a core system, i can essentially limit myself to just a couple games and no more. I have a premium system at home and already have a VGA adapter for the 360, so in terms of accessories, i've got everything that i need. A nice 512mb memory unit is adequate for me to save the few games that i do play. Do I get to play original xbox games? nope, do I want to? not really. Pretty much the only game that i really am going to play is NCAA football 07 and 08 when it comes out, so the Core system is adequate. The wired controller is fine, though i'll prolly be using my wireless one from my premium system. The core system has its market and is NOT intended for the hard core gamers market. As far as i'm concerned, i'm really happy with my core system."
1,Sorry,Xbox is better then this the graphics have not been improved that much and I just don't like it. I wish it could have a cooling fan so they could not burn your games and melt them. Im stucking to my orginal xbox so I can enjoy the good old days next-genration consles now sould be more stable.
2,Terrible Headache!!!,Hi everyonve. I very disappointed with this product. I've received it last weekend and It's already giving me a terrible headache! I just brought it and when I turned on it reboots in 5 minutes. Now I don't no what to do with this crap because I brought it on Amazon and I went back to my country and I don't have my warranty from here.If you want to buy a X360 just wait for the 65nm processor.
2,Great System but Unreliable,"Microsoft is now sending me my THIRD Xbox 360 system in as many months. Every system I've had has experienced freezing problems, locking up on just about every game I own. Sometimes the system doesnt recognize 360 discs as games, prompting me to ""insert this disc into an Xbox 360 console."" (And yes, the system and power supply is ventilated, and the discs are new and scratch free). To Microsoft's credit, I have not had to pay an extra dime for any of this. They have paid for all the shipping and have had the replacements sent to me quickly (within 5 days), and their support department has been generally pleasant to deal with and almost overly-apologetic. I'm happy about that, however, I would like to own one of these things for longer than 30 days without it locking up on me. When it works the system is amazing, but its a typical Microsoft product with its ""sell it now, fix it later"" mentality."
3,xbox 360 core system,its a good system but ypu cant do anything with out the hardrive and linked to the tv. it cant play xbox games without a patch and its a little confussing to use to its fullest.there arent many games for it yet. the bet thing to do is waite for it to go down in price
3,Missing Part--Bad Communication,"I bought the xbox 360 for my son as a Christmas present. However, upon opening it, we found that part of the controller cable was missing so he couldn't play any games. We drove 30 miles to a Wal Mart and he bought a new controller, which came equipped with the correct cable/breakaway piece. I emailed the seller, but have yet to hear one word back! I definitely would NOT buy anything from this merchant again."
2,Desperately Needs Updating,"I'm really surprised that Mr. Massie hasn't bothered to write an update/afterword to this book. A lot of questions left unanswered in the book are now resolved. Such as were the bodies finally buried? What happened to the bodies of Anastasia/Marie and Alexei? What about Soloviev's criminal investigations, what were his findings? The book is outdated as it stands.Furthermore, I found a lot of the book extremely difficult to get through. No less than 101 pages are devoted to Anna Anderson. This is ridiculous for a historical account. And, I found it a difficult 101 pages to read. There are many different characters all trying to block each other's attempts to get Anna Anderson's tissue sample for DNA testing and I really just wanted to know...well is she or isn't she Anastasia?I think this book was written before it should have been. A new book on the subject would be able to address and answer the questions that were not resolved at the time this book was published."
5,The Romanovs: The Final Chapter by Robert K. Massie,"This is a wonderful edition to any Romanov/Russian History/Grand Duchess Anastasia/Anna Anderson Libary. This book scientificly proves that Anna Anderson was NOT Her Imperial Highness, The Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna, but more of the simple, mentally deranged, and wanton Polish peasant, Franziska Shankowvska. It speaks of Tzar Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tzaritsa Alexandra Feodroevna (Princess Alix of Hesse), Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria (Marie, Mashka),and Anastasia Nikolaievna, and Tsarevich Aleksey and of course Anna Anderson/Franziska Shankowvska. It speaks of the many men and women who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia and Tsarevich Alexei and the other, less over publisized Grand Duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and Maria.)"
3,Movie for western and Alamo fans,"While not a great movie, The Man From the Alamo is still an interesting flick to watch. Glenn Ford stars as John Stroud, the man who left the Alamo to go and protect the families of the other defenders of the mission. Obviously this doesn't sit well with Texans who brand him a coward. This is not the most accurate Alamo movie(they seem to be fighting in a big box) but this wasn't meant to be an Alamo movie. Stroud's involvement in the battle is only a jumping off-point for the rest of the movie. Co-starring Chill Wills and Julie Adams. Not the most accurate film, but still very entertaining."
2,Not one of my best books,"The title is the best thing about this book. Besides needing editing work, this book is alot of hype. One can read the Bible and get the answers they need without the critical, don't do it because it's wrong kind of book I found this one to be. I was disappointed, being a saved single myself and waiting on God's man; I don't need anyone telling me what I should not do, I know that. What happen to expressing the LOVE OF GOD? I gave it 2 stars just to be nice. I gave this book away, hopefully the next reader will get more out of it than I did."
5,Life Changing Power.......,"This book changed my life and I am a new woman, I look at sex in a different light and I am more determined than I have ever been in my life to stay pure before marriage. This area has always been a struggle for me I am not ashame to say....but this book is real authentic and it changed my life for the better. Thank you Ty for sharing your story....."
2,Kinda Snobby,"So, I read the other reviews prior to buying for a 7 year old's birthday. I skimmed through it and thought it was really kind of a snobby book. I have never read any of Kay Thompson's other books but I thought it was really wierd that they only talked about the nanny and never about her parents???"
5,Genesis would never look the same,"A unique view of the book of Genesis, as seen through the eyes of a very intelligent woman. An insightful analysis of the texts done by an expert. Best thing is my beliefs were the same after reading this book, I was expecting either a praise to religion or the tale of a rebel, but this is a serious, well thought and complete approach, the perspective and the book though, are unforgettable."
5,Sturdy cables,These cables are nice and sturdy and stay put in the outlets of my video equipment. Great replacement for the cheap cables that they put in with dvd recorders you purchase. I also wanted these to improve digital tv reception over the air with an antenna. They seem to be doing the trick.
2,Very used,"If the seller would told me the book was written all over the place, I would pay a little be more for it."
4,It can work for you,"The book is very accessible. It doesn't intimidate with length or language. Common folk and executives can all be served here, that is beautiful. And it is real. Read it, then act on what you read. Whether your life changes a little or a lot it is up to you. Best of Luck."
2,Glitter stickers???,"The boots have a sparkle that appear to be rhinestones, but don't be fooled! They are actually irridescent stickers, and they make the boot look cheap. Overall, the boot would look significantly better without the ""glitter stickers""!"
1,Not nearly good,The only reason I finished reading this book was to see how it all tied together. Unfortunately it ended more ridiculously than it began. I won't make the same mistake again.
4,"One of my favorites, by a favorite author","If you haven't read any of Cussler's work, this light read is a great starting place. There are elements in every Cussler text that every fan knows to look for. Dirk's autos, his ladies and that elusive appearance by Clive himself. I never miss a word. I am almost disappointed at the making of Sahara into a movie, that is not at all how I pictured Dirk."
2,A drop in Cussler quality !Not a good book for new Cussler Readers!,"Though its book continues the cussler journey with Dirk Pitt at the helm it falls short of expectations established by the previous books. If you have read Cusslers other books i would say you should read it b/c their are huge plot points that occur in this for the series. If you are just looking for something to casually read grab an earlier cussler novel I gaurantee you will find them betterIn this book Dirk Pitt isn't the normal Dirk Pitt, yes he does solve the mystery but he doesn't do it in the regular way, he does have parts where he is the hero but it is not the typical style that I was used to. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't that good"
1,Wow! This was bad!,"Stay away from this book. The first Cussler I read and probably the last. It is a train wreck of a story. Improbable, unbelievable, and at most times stupid."
1,"Fast paced story, but the plot blows!","Clive Cussler generally writes a good fast paced adventure story. A fun read. But the plot of Valhalla Rising strains and breaks credibility.Particularly I didn't care for the author writing himself into the story as a hero at a particularly tight plot point in the story. Sort of a saved by the Gods cameo.If you must read Cussler,read Fire and Ice."
1,Dirk Drivel,"This is my first Clive Cussler book, and I found it to be literary drivel. The book was typical ""if you can't figure out how to explain an event, make something phenomenal happen to explain away the event"". The situations in the book are extremely cliche, and predictable. The only subplot in the book that wasn't predictable, was so far fetched, and out of place with the rest of the story it almost made me mad to be treated like a simpleton. Clive Cussler also uses himself in the book as a one-off character who saves the day. This I also found to be hogwash. In all, I was extremely under impressed with the book. I enjoy high adventure in the style of Indiana Jones and any Star Wars novel, I felt this book insulted my intelligence. I may read another Clive Cussler book to see if this particular work was just a bad day. Happy Reading everyone.."
3,Valhalla Rising,"I was totally enthralled with Valhalla Rising, until the final chapter!!!! Come on Clive, 2 grown kids, named Dirk and Summer? That was just about the worst ending to a Clive book I've ever read. I wish I would have stopped reading the chapter before! I certainly hope in the next book, the Dirk/Summer reincarnation is a international plot against Dirk,that brings together the entire NUMA team and affects each one of them."
3,Suspend Your Disbelief Just a Little,"If you are familiar with Clive Cussler novels, you know the deal; he always writes almost the same plot, same characters, almost the same evil CEO. But who cares right? It's Clive Cussler. Like Ian Fleming with his high-tech gagets, and babes galore. Clive Cussler has his brand high-adventure and action (usually on the high seas), and with Dirk Pitt's 'aww schucks' attitude toward heroism, what's not to like?If you are reading Clive Cussler for the first time, and you chose Valhalla Rising; just know that Clive's writing isn't Jules Vern or H.G. Wells. But as mentioned before, high-adventure and action. For me, I'd like to read Clive Cussler novels on a long trip, or out in the backyard drinking a couple of beers, but again that's just me."
3,What an ending,"I am a huge fan of the Dirk Pitt series, I've read them all. This was a great book and I thank Clive Cussler for continuing to write them. However, the ending was the worst idea in the world. I don't know what Cussler was thinking! If you are a fan of the Dirk Pitt Series I sugggest reading this book, but do not read the last chapter. The last chapter will ruin the image of Dirk Pitt."
1,Idiotic,"Cussler has written some OK stories. This isn't one of them. The plot is utterly ridiculous, the dialogue ludicrous, the writing filled with factual and grammatic errors. I enjoyed some of Cussler's early books, but this is a flopperoo!"
1,valhalla rising,"Okay am I the only one that missed the point with this book? Is it written intentionally to strain the limits of credibility, ala the old 'boys own adventure' books? This is the first book of Cussler's that I've read, so maybe I need to subject myself to another bout of awfulness to determine if the style is for real. If one considered the inclusion of the author as a character as unbelievable trite, it got even worse with the saccharine ending - the arrival of Pitt's long lost children curiously named..Dirk and Summer, duh!"
1,Everything that's Bad in Fiction,"Is in this book. God, it's awful.Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitts, is the perfect superhero. Smart, strong, rich, dedicated, meticulous with so much time on his hands he can personally restore vintage aircraft, head a special projects division of a super-secret government agency, travel the world, develop new technology and carry on several successful relationships - - but he's always in such a hurry that he accomplishes everything at the last minute!Aargh!No flaws . . . he even, singlehandedly, saved a plane full of disabled children from a Red Baron copycat in a dogfight over New York. Blah!America is always right, the hero is always perfect, and the military can do no wrong."
4,Valhalla Rising,"an interesting tie together of Norsmen,Nemo and Vernes.. and I would never have ever guessed the final ending... a quick read of course I really enjoy CusslerRichard"
5,Poignant and moving,"My 3rd graders had asked a lot about Hitler, Nazis, and the Holocaust after one student had brought up the subject. I tried to make it understandable to that age group. But when I was searching some of Patricia Polacco's books for another unit, I came across The Butterfly. I decided this was the perfect way for my students to access the subject, by seeing it through the eyes of these 2 girls. My class was so quiet and focused as I read it. We talked about it a lot when I finished. As usual, Mrs. Polacco handles a tough subject with sensitivity and art that conveys the deeper meaning, yet in a way elementary students can handle. I am an even bigger fan of her after reading this book."
5,The Butterfly,"I loved the ""ghost"" in this book! I also loved the secret basement in the floor. This is the best book of Patricia Polacco book I've ever read."
1,"A terrible ""tribute"".","Man, this CD doesn't sound anything like BSB. It sounds like a bunch of cheesy singers trying to mock them. Mark my words, if you buy this CD you'll be sorry. I wasn't foolish enough to buy this, I just listened to the samples. If you do the same, I'm sure you'll agree with me."
1,AcomData External 160GB USB 2.0 Hard Drive,I've had the drive for several years. Periodically it would lock up and I would have to unplug and replug. Last week it locked up permanently (the red light stays on) and I cannot access my data. I contacted Acomdata customer support several times with no response. I've read that others have been unable to get support. Not a reliable product or company!
4,A pause to catch your breath back,"In my oppinion, this is the less accomplished album of the group's recent history. There were changes with the members ( both accordeonist Gabriel Gomes and keyboard player Rodrigo Leo left to start their own projects ) and the substitutes ( Carlos Maria Trindade on Keyboards and Fernando Júdice on bass guitar ) were not able to maintain the ""Madredeus sound"" at the same standards, not because of the quality of their playing, but maybe for a certain lack, due to their recent arrival, to get in the spirit of the group's personality. Anyway, it is still a very good album, more introspective and mature than its predecessors maybe, but not certainly one to discard. If you're a newcomer, do not start with these one. If you have the others, this is a variation, but certainly not an unwelcome one."
1,flimsy and cheap,"Elastic in wrists and waist way too tight. Material thin as tissue paper. Zipper flimsy. Pockets too shallow. I threw it away. Do not buy, worth maybe ten bucks."
4,Not too bad,"Good jacket, runs very small. And the pockets were a bit small. I was always worried I was dropping things out of my pockets. And there's no inside or chest pocket. But the jacket is very warm and pretty light weight."
3,Slicker Brush,"Seems like a reasonably good quality brush and after using for a couple of months the bristles are holding up well. It is also comfortable for the dog. However, my dog has a two layer coat and while the brush does a great job on the outer coat, it does not go as deep as I expected into the under coat. If I repeat brushing with my old rounded head pin brush (much fewer pins/bristles)it is apparent that the JW brush leaves a lot of tangles in the undercoating."
2,Cocker Puppy does not like this,"It was recommended to have a soft slicker/soft pin brush for my english cocker spaniel. Because I plan on doing my cocker's grooming I wanted to introduce grooming tools in order of what I thought would be the least invasive. I have used this brush on my puppy's dry coat while she was relaxed on my lap. Gently and lightly stroking through fine un-matted fur, my puppy jumped. After praising her for sitting so that I could try again, she allowed me two strokes and started barking. I have tried multiple times since, but my puppy will not have it. Personally I like the grip on the handle it is very comfortable and easy to use. I have done the pin test on my hands and arms and do not have streaks from it. I am hoping this brush works as my puppy gets older, maybe her skin is too sensitive and soft. For now, I have to use the KONG rubber slicker brush which she loves."
5,Wonderful! One of our favorites!,"Wonderful story about a child's prayer asking for God to always be there. My kid's have a CD player in their room. I did not know this but they would sneak and put the CD on at night to listen to while they drifted off to sleep. One day, I dIscovered what they were doing because they could sing the whole song by heart! ""Dear God, I am calling, please listen, it's me! You know all about my day, from A to Z."" It was one of the sweetest things I have ever heard. The lyrics and music are perfect for children and the perfect lullaby for bed time. It will always be one of our favorites."
4,flawed but essential,"Ours just broke- structural failure after three years. I used it all the time for cooking. Extremely handy. Add salt to pasta water, s & p to eggs, etc. etc. etc. all with one hand. One thing I came to appreciate is that the salt grinder worked in humid conditions that caused the shaker to clog. I have become so dependent on having it next to the stove that I'm going to have to get another right away. Worth the money, but they could improve it. Hope they do. Meanwhile, I don't see anything out there to replace it."
1,Poor quality,The handle broke the first time we used this. We had one previously that lasted 8 years before wearing out. My husband made me hunt down the exact same product since he loved it and we used it daily. This one broke the first time I squeezed the handles. They must have changed something.
5,Great,These floor mats are going to protect the carpet in our new Ford Explorer. They fit well and match well.
3,Inappropriate Winnie ask about virgins,"Just noticed that this toy has a Winnie the Pooh voice that says ""CAN YOU SEE HOW MANY VIRGINS ARE HERE WITH US?""Anyone else's toy say this same thing?"
2,A Tad Too Precious,I was disappointed. The recipes are too rarified and complex for even a more experienced home cook.
5,Track Listing,"Bing sings: A time to be jolly, Some children see him, I sing Noel, Come dear children, Round and round the Christmas tree, A Christmas Toast, Bright Bright holly berries and A Christmas toast. Kate sings Deck the halls, Joy to the world, It came upon a midnight clear, Silver bells, I heard the bells on Christmas Day, Christmas Eve in my home town and It's beginning to look like Christmas."
5,Best of the Stylistics,They sang the best songs I can remember as a teenager. I love the smooth sound of their voice. They bring back old memories.
5,looking for,"Actually I'm looking for the album that this particular song is on.It's not a very popular song buy the Stylistics,but I love this song for sentimental value.The song is ""Children of the Night"".It was played in the Late 80's I believe.If anyone can please tell me wich album this song is on I would appreciate it.Thank you in advance, Linda"
4,THE BOMB!,"This is the ""BOMB"". An excellent CD! A must have. Tracks 1,2,4, and 9 definatelly make the whole CD worth buying. Highly recommended."
3,Best of Stylistics,Only a few tracks I like of this CD. Stylistics is another great group. Glad you had on inventory. Thanks.
5,The Condominium Concepts Book,Excellent Book........Explains things in Laymen's terms - helps you put a stop to the Condo Comando's!
4,Good reference book,"Good reference for Condo Board members and Condo owners.Would like to see the samples listed in a separate chapter, however. Some were a little confusing. But I am glad I bought this book."
1,What does it mean?,"What does it mean when you write a book about New York, cover every 'neighborhood' you can think of, yet don't mention Harlem? For the author's information, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and does have some wonderful restaurants to enjoy, i.e, Copelands, Sylvia's, Amy Ruth's! I just visited New York and did go to Harlem, but this book wasn't the resource. In general, I thought it fell short in alot of areas. I found more updated and useful information in the AAA guidebook and WHERE magazine. Save your money!"
5,great product!,My son wanted this to go with his XBOX 360 and it was worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who has an xbox360 and KIDS! It's great.
5,xbox 360 black play & charge kit,"THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the kit comes with a battery pack, with a built in rechargeable battery! it fits into any xbox 360 controller, and you don't need regular AAs, so you won't run into that battery shortage crisis! and you don't need to worry about putting in non rechargeable batteries by mistake, so they dont explode and destroy your controller! also it wieghs less than a battery holder with AAs! Plus, if its dead, you can plug it into your console, and simutaniously play AND charge!!!! its great!!! and the battery packs come in a variety of colors! BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!"
3,ITs just ok,"I was going to buy a cheaper one from a different brand but all the reviews said that it didnt hold a charge. So I went with the Microsoft brand since it had better reviews. I got it, charged it, and it lasted probably a week on a 4 bar of batter with moderate play and it hasnt held a charge like that since. The only saving grace is that you can charge while you play so 3 stars. Wish it would hold that charge for longer so I could actually use my Wireless controller the way it was meant to be tho without needing batteries all the time"
5,worked great,worked great fast deliery and charges my controller and can use with out batteries for a more lighter controller. buy
1,This actually kills the batteries!,"When I first got my 360 in 2006, I picked up 2 of these, and used them often. When I had the controllers plugged into the system with them, I noticed something.A lot of times, after I turned off my console, the fans on the console would keep running if I had one of the play and charge kits plugged in. I thought it was just continuing to charge the controller. Little did I know, it was actually draining them.In less than 6 months... neither of the batteries I got with the play and charge kits held a charge at all. These are bad news and a waste of money. TheXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitis a much better investment. I have been using this since then and have had no problems with it at all. Not to mention it charges the batteries much more quickly.It's a little more expensive, but well worth it."
1,DON'T BUY THE PLAY AND CHARGE KIT! WON'T CHARGE!,"Do a google search for ""xbox play and charge kit won't charge"".When I bought the play and charge kit I played games for about a week, then I didn't play for more than a week. If you EVER let the play and charge kit sit unused for more than a week, it is DEAD and will NEVER CHARGE AGAIN. If the charger doesn't receive a power signature back from the Li-ion battery (aka the battery needs charging), it registers that no battery is connected and will not charge.Terrible product!!"
4,works for the most part,"this does what it says it does wellthe only problem with mine: the light that switches from green to red when you recharge went out the second day after I bought it. It still charges and does the job so its only a minor inconveniencealso, if you leave it plugged in when you turn off your 360 the fan still runs which is kind of annoying so i just unplug it when im done playingoverall a good deal considering the small fortune I used to waste on AA batteries"
3,Works great....some cons though (play and charge kit rev.),"Ok there is a reason why i gotten the wireless controller. Its very convenient. BUT this charger cord just completely ruined the game play for me.PROS:~ Be able to charge your battery while you play. Great if you have only one battery pack.~ Comes with a Black battery pack, which is quite expensive itself after i did some research.CONS:~ This ruines your battery pack charge. Overtime, your battery pack will loose the charge faster. To stop this, just only put your controller on charger when your battery is completely drained.~ I like my controller wireless not wired. The cord basically temporally converts your wireless controller to wired.~ This requires your Xbox to be on. This will not charge your controller if you plugged it into your ac/dc usb charger.I do not recommend this if you have multiple battery packs. If you have multiple battery packs you use.This is what you need if you have multiple battery packs:Xbox 360 Quick Charger Kit"
5,"good idea, good execution","A worthy buy in the long run for the money you'll save on batteries, plus the battery packs last a long time. The cables are nice and long too."
3,"Charges, but lacks in esthetics.","These chargers work, but the cords are long, and don't always connect fully. I would order a different kind of charger had I understood what this product was really intended for, which is to play with the wires plugged into the controllers."
5,Nice,"I use this frequently! Being in college I play my box fairly often and it's nice to just be able to plug the controller straight into the box rather than have to scrounge around for loose batteries or steal them from the remote hahaIt has yet to fail with syncing or recharging, I think that I've noticed the battery holding less and less of a charge but that was to be expected I guess"
4,"good while it lasted, cats","It worked well until my cats found it. My cats chewed through the wires and kept on unplugging it. If you have cats that chew through wires, get batteries."
4,A must-have addon for your Xbox 360!,"This was one of my first purchases for my new Xbox 360 and I consider it such a necessity that I was surprised when I opened the Xbox 360 packaging and didn't find this in there. Blowing through AA batteries is just a waste of money and while rechargeable AA's are an option, this is much less hassle at a reasonable price. The battery is supposed to be good for 30 hours without a charge (I haven't timed it), and you can continue playing while the battery is charging. The charging cable is about 10 feet in length, so you're not going to find yourself tethered to the console on an uncomfortably short leash. Since the cord is just a normal USB plug on the console end, you should be able to charge off any powered USB input--whether it's a computer or cell phone charger (but use your own judgement).My only gripe is that it seems to take a long time to get a full charge, but that may be more of my own impatience than slowness on the part of the charger."
1,Worked only once,"I don't understand. I needed an extra battery and charger (because we have 2 xBoxes). The charger/cord/light worked the first time I used it right out of the box.Once my battery needed recharging, the charger wouldn't work and the charger light (red when charging and green when fully charged) wouldn't come on! I can't get it to charge the battery. What is going on?I've had this kind trouble with universal items but not Microsoft items.I knew I should have just asked my husband to pick one of these up from the Microsoft employee store in Redmond."
2,Very handy... For a few months,"I enjoy the ease of use, it is convenient to just plug it in to recharge the batteries.Unfortunately two out of three of my battery packs died within 6 months of purchase, which means they are only usable while plugged in. As such, I have returned to using rechargeable Energizer batteries, which are cheaper and more reliable (as long as you keep a few extra pairs on hand in case you run out of juice mid-game).If you're a gambler, you might as well pick up at least one Play & Charge kit for the sake of convenience, but keep in mind that it costs as much as four AA rechargeable batteries and a charger."
2,Broken after 6 months,"I bought 2 of these, after about 6 months, one of the battery won't charge anymore, so it has to be plugged in all the time while playing. The other one's charging light doesn't work anymore, so you can't tell if it's charging. They both still work... but I'll have to get new ones soon."
2,Dead again,I don't know how others are finding the battery and charge kit. But after a week the battery stopped taking a charge. Other than the cord the thing is worthless.
4,Great!,"It's better than having to use/pay for tons of batteries! It's really convenient just to plug in the controller when you're not using it, and it charges. I'm using a wireless adapter for PC, though, and keep in mind that for some reason it won't work with the PC when it's plugged in. I have another wireless gamepad, though (using a DS3, the PS3 controller), so I just use that when my 360 controller is charging."
3,so so,"A pretty generic Stones bio. I kind of skimmed it because a lot was quotes I'd read in magazines already. I stopped at the bits I hadn't read. If you've never read a Stones bio before, this will serve. But if you have, you'll be reading a lot of the same stuff you've already read."
4,I Got Satisfaction,"This is the only Stones' book I've read and I plan on reading more, but as a start, I was impressed and feel Davis has written a decent biography of the band. He appears to deal thoroughly with the early years of the band all the way up to the death of Brian Jones. The Mick Taylor years seem a bit rushed (he wasn't there that long, though), in fact, the last two decades of the band seem written hurriedly, but I guess they weren't working nearly as much as they had in their true youth or weren't making as much news.The details of the interrelationships of Anita Pallenberg, Brian Jones, Keith Richard and Mick Jagger alone would probably make a great book on it's own. I wouldn't mind knowing more about that!"
4,Old Gods Far From Dead,"Great book for a Stones fan, would have liked it if the went into more detail on the Voodoo & Bridges sessions/tours. Get it today if you are looking for a Stones Book."
4,Amazing sound,"I love these headphones. I was scared at first but that all went away. These are the best headphones you can ever purchase for 98$. Can't go wrong. Mind you the regular price is 400$. The one thing that did annoy me however is the long long long coil cord. Makes it really hard for every day use, i have to tuck it in my pockets or something because if I let it hang it will touch the ground. But everything else about these are perfect. BUY BUY BUY"
3,not what i expected,"i have read quite a few reviews over the last few weeks and general everyone seems to like the RP-DJ1200s. great sound, great comfort... my first disappointment, which was largely due to the amazon description, was that these are much more of an on-ear design than over the ear (unless you have 1"" ears). secondly, the sound was not impressive at all. it didn't seem to have the depth that i was anticipating. i'm by no means an audiophile but general like high quality music products and these don't come close in my opinion. they were reasonably comfortable for an on-ear headphone though."
2,Interesting concept---disappointing delivery,"While I liked the idea of the book--a group of likeminded individuals who form their own artistic haven--I found the author's writing to be flabby. More often than not, he tells you about the characters, their traits, and their motives rather than showing them to you. The result is that the text has a forced perspective, like propaganda. He uses anachronistic ""therapy speak"" for emotions (""your behavior is unhealthy and destructive"") and has a habit for making all eight main characters to agree en masse (count the times he starts a sentence with the word ""everyone,"" ""immediately"" or ""of course."" These things may seem petty but they really got on my nerves. I kept imagining how good the novel could have been with a heavier editorial hand."
1,My Mother's Songs,"Well this would have been a great CD if the person I had bought it off on Amazon had not only sent me a genuine copy and not a ripped copy, but also if it had contained the correct songs.Apart from that, Vitas is brilliant, and if you go to his website which does have an english version, [...] , then you will see that not only is Vitas a great artist with a huge amount of wonderful songs which you can listen to there, but you will also be able to download a lot of them for free because he is a very generous person. You can buy his CDs from there, or his registered stockist which is Gemini Sun Records in the USA, rather than receive a bad copy from a seller on here.As yet, it seems Amazon will keep on allowing certain sellers to continue with their dud copies because only the artist or a representative that can sign for them is allowed to make a complaint about pirating their CD's which is totally unfair when the artist lives far away and does not speak our language."
5,A very engaging book,The book is a good overview of macro-evolution and Neo-Darwinism. Good to see that the book is very open-minded and lets you make your own conclusions. Carl Zimmer describes the facts and the doubts that come with the scientific discovery. The style if very good too - very easy to read. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,Whats the big deal ?,"Yeah, its heavy and the drums are ""technical"", but I just cant get into this. I honestly find Cryptopsy to be rather boring. The vocals sometimes remind me of some hardcore yelping, maybe not as much on this album as on others. I dont really care what the majority thinks, Id much rather listen to Scream Bloody Gore by Death (the opening of Infernal Death is heavier than this [...])."
4,A pretty cool little book for your kids.,"If you have kids who like reading comic books, (Spider-Man in particular) or drawing cartoon characters, this would be a good book to help teach them a few essentials, and it's pretty easy for kids to understand. Who knows, maybe your kid will some day get a career in the industry, then you can capitalize on the hundreds of dollars you spend buying them comics in the first place. It's a win/win situation..."
5,"Perfect product, despite price","I have used the equivalent Sony product and am excited to have this Panasonic adapter in its place. It seems better constructed, with durable case, dual-spring head for excellent contact and sound, and a one-sided tape that ensures the player won't hang/flip sides continuously. I have an mp3 player running through this to my truck's custom system, and it has sound equivalent to the cd player (no buzz, loss)."
3,Tape movement noises,"This makes very good music quality from my portable player, but there is some significant noise coming from the tape itself in my tape deck. It's not as quiet as the Sony version was before it broke and started loud clicking after 4 months. At least I hope this Panasonic one will last longer."
1,Dud,"A real dud. Fidelity was poor, bass exaggerated, highs muted and the thing makes way too much noise. I attribute it to poor quality construction. A total waste of money. Use it only once."
5,Kids Love This Video,My kids and their friends love this video. I have a boy 6 and a girl 8 and all their friends come over to do the Chicken Fat video. I recommend this to all parents.
2,Not bad; reads like an infomercial,"Just like the reader from San Diego, I thought this book could have been written in a 20 page pamphlet. And unlike the reader from San Diego, this is not my first NLP book. I have read severals and found this book to be a simple rehash of the deeper stuff on NLP. It seem like Mr. Brooks was trying to stretch representational systems into a book.Nothing too insightful for those who already know NLP, but not a bad starter to get your feet wet."
1,Don't waste your money on this tape.,"I was very disappointed with this tape. This tape should contain the same information as the ""Instant Rapport"" book. It doesn't. Instead, the tape only covers one aspect of the book's information and is incomplete.While I remain impressed with the information contained in the book, don't waste a penny on the tape!"
4,Slyly Done,"Its great to lay down and listin to this CD at night and just listin to the ramblings of an old man. Dead Radio City is hard to put into a certain category because it touches them all. Burroughs goes from disturbing revelations to dark comedies to simple life findings. The music backing his voice in this album is pretty good even though it sometimes eclipses his voice at times. Burroughs has a great monotonic voice on this album which creates a great atmosphere and really drills home his jaded,disgruntled, and sarcastic message. All in All every song on here is not a winner but most of the album is pure nirvana."
5,The Word is a Virus,"The word is a virus, and at night before I sleep I turn my brain over to this recording of Burroughs. The wise old man saw more than most, and if you're willing to listen he'll blow your mind for the price of a CD. The truth can be difficult and Genius sometimes hurts."
3,Camerons smoking chips,Overpriced you could use any other chips from your local General Store and it will do the job just as good for the fraction of the cost.
5,Unbelievably fabulous -- the best.,"My son bought this TV months ago right before the upgraded 1080 hit BestBuy stores. He paid $3,400 for it. I just bought it at BestBuy this week for $2,199. I have never gone crazy over any electronic gadget until my son got this TV. I already have a Samsung DLP 42"" TV I paid $3K for in 2004. I really liked my TV until my son got this Pioneer Plasma. Now I am so spoiled and I cannot get his TV out of my mind. It's mind blowing. Watching everything/anything is enjoyable on it -- the grandkids playing games; movies that are boring as heck (Pirates of the Caribean 3) but visually mesmerizing on this TV. So, wait until you see Planet Earth on this TV in your own home. You'll never be the same. Again, I'm grandparent age. I don't go crazy over electronic devices --until this! Mine is on its way."
5,Awesome TV,"After researching and comparing Plasma vs LCD, this is by far one of the best out there. Picture is amazing and better than other expensive brands.1080p LCDs and other brands cannot match the picture quality of this Pioneer. Best for watching movies and sports in HD. Excellent value."

3,Too hot,"I need to have a paeaffin bath for arthritis in my hands. This unit melts thr paraffin quickly, just as advertised. However, it's still very hot even after turning to 'keep warm', and letting it sit for 15-20 minutes with the lid off. All in all a good machine, but would try another way of cooling wax down a little more before use."
5,Wonderful product,"I am a hard sell, having tried just about everything to help with dry hands and cracked cuticles. This bath was cheap enough that I was willing to try another gadget and its working beautifully. FINALLY something that works. Tried creams, vitamin E oil with cotton gloves for nightwear, biotin, special shower filter. But when your job requires hand washing every 30 minutes and you live in the frigid north where today its -28 wind chill, there is not much that works. I have been using it for 20 days now and even the whorls of my fingertips are smooth. Oh, to put on the glove liners, don't try inserting your hand in, rather put the end of the bag at your fingertips and roll the bag over your hand. I have done my feet as well. Its rather small for feet but it works for my size 7s. Its a nice product for the price and very easy to use. I hope it holds up to daily use. So far, so good."
2,Disappointed,I am very disappointed with the REVLON Paraffin bath. It takes longer than the instructed ninty minutes to heat up and it doesn't get very warm. Even after 2 hours the paraffin was only slightly warm and did not stay on my hands. I wished I had read reviews before I made my purchase. I would not recommend that anyone waste money on this item.
1,Very disappointing,"I loved Maile Meloy's story collection, Half in Love, and also enjoyed Liars and Saints. I had really been looking forward to A Family Daughter but I am just so disappointed! The plot is often ridiculous,and the characters just aren't credible enough to carry the book. Much of it is extremely predictable and reminded me of a soap opera. The dialogue just doesn't make sense. A five year old, for example, can speak in complete sentences in real life. This one, a key character, just keeps saying one word, ""Dogs!"" over and over again. I think the difference with this book is that it is completely invented, Half in Love was obviously something she knew from growing up in Montana, and you felt the place and the people resonate through her eyes. This book is just not her best. I am half way through and I can completely understand why other reviewers said they didn't finish it."
1,LOSERS ALL,"This book gets 1 star from me and only because there's nothing less I can give it. ""A Family Daughter"" is a total waste of time. The characters are complete and utter LOSERS. They were, like most losers, extremely bored with absolutely everything and that probably had a lot to do with the fact that they were so boring themselves. The characters tried in vain to make themselves interesting by their outlandish behavior, but came off as completely selfish and hopelessly boring. I found absolutely nothing to recommend this book."
3,A bit of a misnomer...,"Although this book is called a sequel to Liars and Saints, I think that is a bit misleading. Reviews have called it a ""different angle"", but this goes much further than that, actually changing facts from the book before. Although this is all somewhat explained later in the book, I was, in fact, disappointed. I did enjoy the book, the writing is wonderful, but there were certain characters that were so altered from Liars that it was frustrating -- after growing to know these characters it was off-putting for them to act so contraindicative of their established selves. That made reading this book distracting. I compare it in that way to Little Altars Everywhere and Secrets of the Ya ya Sisterhood. depending on which book you read first, you ultimately had more sympathy for one generation or the other. I think that people who read Liars first will be a bit let-down, while as a stand alone book, I think this could really be enjoyed."
5,Greatly enjoyed the book from a reader in Santa Barbara,Another great book from Meloy. Her style is fabulous and captivating. I will buy every book she writes.
3,"Cute toy, safety clip not the safest.","The toy itself is really cute and enticing for my cat, but the safety clip is REALLY hard to unclip. I had to get tools out to unclip it! So obviously I don't feel safe leaving it out when I'm gone because my cat could somehow get it wrapped around her limbs and the safety clip will not come undone. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase."
5,NICE,"After using my new wrenches, I recommended them to all my friends. The price is great, and the quality is very high."
4,Nice quality,I love these wrenches. You can get into hard to reach places and they afre very durable. The only complaint that I have is that the swivel head does not lock into position which can cause some sever knuckle busting. However they afre good quality and nice. I paid $40 Dollars for these and there isn't anything that can begin to compare for the price.
5,Toms review,"I am happy with this wrench set, it is very high quality and should last me a long time.I have been a technician for 30+ years and have been a regular customer with Snap-on tools. I was very surprised"
4,Autobiography of a Face,"a little wrinkled, but the text is what matters and it is a great read.... if you are into depressing stories...."
4,I thought this book was very touching,I had started this book and not gotten very far with it when I put it down to read something else. I am glad that I kept a hold of it because the next time I picked up I couldn't stop reading it. Very powerful memoir.
2,The demise of the English language,"This book is fantastic. It is dark and real, raw and breathtaking. However, the Kindle version of it is so riddled with spelling and grammatical errors I could not finish reading it. This is what happens to the publishing industry when they lay off all of their editors."
5,what a great treat,"It's a mystery why Manfred Mann's Earth Band hasn't become one of those bands that people need to dig up and discover, and it's just as disappointing that the band has been attached as a one-hit wonder over the years (which was never really that great of a song anyway because it didn't provide the unusual style of music that the band normally puts on record).These guys had the talent and the unusual and unpredictable songwriting skills to be considered one of the best rock bands of the 70's. But for some reason, it never happened.The title song of The Good Earth is a pretty good hard rock track that almost feels multi-part, but not quite. Just really good rock music. This is a fairly ordinary album compared to other releases from the band, but totally worth owning if you're a curious kind of person when it comes to finding out about 70's rock. You won't be disappointed."
1,"Payback Is Hell, Parts 1 and 2","Leaving the manipulative gestures up to his record company (again), Ryan Adams croons his way through a so-so collection of forgettable post-""Gold"" schmaltz, from which I can hear a glimmer of the genius he once believed himself to be, and apparently believed all too well. Monumental, crushing ego mixes with a desperately nasty record company like gas & fire, and I ain't buyin' it. Lost Highway, ""Where Artists Go to Die"", and its overinflated roster of has-beens, can kiss my grits."
2,he freaked out,"Ryan's first two albums were so special. Really amazing 5 star affairs. And then his fame and fortune and all the press and Jack White squabbles got to him and he just freaked. He has destroyed what was a brilliant start. Still, I think he can come back, he just needs to go back to where he started and write sincere thoughtful songs and use his talent. And he really needs to stop talking to the press and saying things that make him look like a you know what.I am still rooting for him because he has written some of the best songs of the last 10 years....hands down. I hope he comes through with the next one."
5,god of war 2,This came very quickly and looked brand new.. this was a great buy! I would do it again in a heartbeat!! my son loooooved it! :)
4,"Still no ""look"" button","A stunning game with incredible graphics. All it needed was a ""look"" button to achieve full immersion. Still, a great installment to the series."
4,Good... but not as good as the first one.,Something is missing. It's a great game... don't get me wrong. But the first one was jaw dropping... this has some great stuff but it's missing something. There are a couple of super annoying game problems. Stuff with the wings is super annoying. It just keeps going and going. I love the game but I just wasn't into it for long.
4,AWESOME!!!,"I was very upset when this show was cancelled. It isn't a show just anyone can watch. This is a very unrealistic show for most people, but being from Florida, it is totally the relationship my mom and I share."
3,"Kath & Kim, Season 1","This show is a lot of fun. The characters are pretty nutty without a clue; but to me, they are very lovable in their ignorance of many things. It seems to be a spoof on all of us humans when we get into that mode of thinking we are the center of the Universe. It probably isn't for everyone--I see some of the reviewers hit it pretty hard with their opinions, but it is meant to be light entertainment, and it really entertained me! Thanks everyone."
4,"Easy to read, gripping book","Really enjoyed Access To Power. It's a thrilling read, one I couldn't put down. I deduct one star as at some stages I found the plot unbelievable! I found Frank a well constructed lead character who was likable throughout.All in all, given the value of the Kindle edition, I found it a great buy. Worth a read."
2,The only good thing is that reads fast...,"After reading the reviews on ..., this book seemed like a slam dunk...a great political thriller. It was anything but. My first warning sign should have been ""a novel in the tradition of Vince Flynn."" I don't like Mr. Flynn's work and Mr. Ellis follows in the tradition of overblown plots, fairly weak dialogue, and no character development. This might work for a major motion picture, but for 400 pages it is absurd. There is little to like in the characters, but then again we don't get to know them at all. The story flies along in short bits and nothing seems real. A media consultant hero is a stretch to begin with, but who knows it might have worked. Instead, we get absurd ideas, weak characters, and convoluted stories. Yikes."
4,Riveting,"Wow,stayed up all night with this one! I really could not guess where it was headed. Very good - an exciting deaf"
3,A useful exercise to read before you see it on stage.,"There is no way that reading this play can come close, even in imagination, to approximating the strange theatrical experience. A mouth, just a mouth, suspended some feet above the stage, gabbles at speed for about fifteen minutes, as a woman, although claiming it is 'Not I', tells her life story of silent emotional repression finally released in ceaseless logorrhea, like one of Joyce's passive Dubliners finally shrieking. This verbal onslaught is counterpointed by a silent auditor figure and his physical gestures. Reading the play is very useful, however, just so you can get some idea of what the woman is saying if you ever do get a chance to see it performed."
2,Paint shop Pro version 8.0,"I have been using PSP-7 (anniversary addition) for some time and decided to pony up the $... for Version 8. Various incentives dropped the actual price to around $... (Maybe- I havent received the rebate from JASC yet).I was a bit chapped to find from JASC tech support that PSP-8 (release as version 8.00)was essentially the same as their Beta test version released months earlier. PSP-8 out of the box frequently caused my reasonably cool featured PC to choke and crash - particularly when using the selection tool. The free tech support informed me that the version 8.01 update was available for free download. The update seemed to help with some of the problems, but version 8.01 is still rather bug infested and not fully ready for prime time in my opinion.Thank goodness I still have the older PSP-7 that I can revert to when version 8.01 chokes my machine."
5,The Last Good Version of Paint Shop Pro,"If you're seeking an outstanding and economically priced graphics editor that competes on many levels for Adobe's hugely more expensive Photoshop, V8 of Jasc Paint Shop Pro is a great buy! Whatever you do, avoid the later Corel versions of this masterful product. I purchased the post-acquisition version, Corel Paint Shop Pro X -- as a long time user of Jasc's excellent software, I was disappointed and felt betrayed by the horrendous modifications made to the product by Corel. Corel has managed to morph Jasc's sleek, effective, intelligently implemented, high productivity tool into yet another of the many bloated, unreliable ""all in one"" software products on the market that do nothing well and lock up your computer in the process. On my dual-processor high performance P4 system, Corel's X version takes 30 secons just to load!!! Bottom line? Get this version .. Jasc's PSP 8 is and will always be a terrific graphics editor that you will be happy with."
4,Not as much as the previous jump,"Don't mistake this for a ripper of a review, this is one of the best price/performance graphics programs out there (okay GIMP is free so if you get anything out of it its p/p numbers are better, but I much prefer PSP). That said I don't think the jump in features and functionality from 7-8 was as defining to me as the jump from 6-7. I could point to increases in my productivity when I moved to 7 almost immediately, in the jump to 8 things have been less marked. Still, I am glad that I purchased this program and sometimes it is those small touches that make something superior."
2,UGH,I have personally seen this author at conferences. Although she has great info to share this book is VERY difficult to get through. I was very disappointed in the content and I have a masters degree. I would say this book is best for those involved in research end of education and would send the book back if I could.
1,You Don't Always Get What You Want,"The ad on Amazon for this CD lists 26 songs. I rec'd the CD and there are only 20 songs on the CD, and only 5 are the same that are listed in the product description on Amazon. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing this CD and I plan on returning my copy."
2,another intersting concept mindlessly wasted by Hollywood script writers.,"Some of these reviewers are wasting their breath writing reviews the length of War and Peace.This could have been a great and scary serial killer flick...alas, it isn't. Remote viewing is far-fetched to begin with, but since that was the writers' ace up their sleeve, they should have gone all out with it, and just dropped the FBI angle. They should have stayed with the Ben Kinglsey character as he hunted down killer after killer...They didn't. Their biggest goof.And the ending? Falls apart--like so many Hollywood serial killer flicks...because they are always trying to cover their sorry behinds by covering all the basis. In other words: trying to please everyone, the largest audiance, etc. Whenever you attempt that, you, very often, end up pleasing no one."
3,"""Suspect Zero""","This was an ok movie but the was really weird and very hard to follow. The plot was good but turned out to be really bad movie. I liked Ben Kingsly and carrie- anne moss and aaron eckheart. The director screwed it up when he went overboard on the weirdness, he drowned the film in it. This will make a good TNT drama in the future along with ""Against the Ropes"", and ""Twisted"". See the film if you must I was let down by it.See instead:""Seven""""Red Dragon""""The Silence of the Lambs""""Hannibal""""Taking Lives""""Identity""""Memento"""
1,I thought it sucked,"ONE more movie with the woman acting as if she has something to do with being a man. Plot was weak and implausible. There are no ""remote viewers""."
2,Boring ...,"A stalwart actor like Ben Kingsley is truly wasted in this movie.Sir Ben Kingsley plays the role of a Benjamin O'Ryan, a clairvoyant undercover out-of-service FBI agent who is following a serial killer across the country. En route, Benjamin uncovers other serial killers using clairvoyance and murders them. Sursprisingly, Benjamin leaves a signature (a zero with a stroke) after every murder. This trait confuses the in-service FBI agents Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) & his partner (Carrie-Anne Moss) to believe that Benjamin is the actual killer on the prowl. The story meanders along slowly and Mackelway eventually (after getting lots of confusing hints from Benjamin) figures out Benjamin is actually leading them to the killer. Visuals of Benjamin getting clairvoyance are dark and disturbing. The graphic images just add to the darkness.All in all a boring fare that will give you a bad taste.I think actors like Ben Kingsley and Carrie-Anne Moss have been wasted in this movie."
4,Good Drama Movie,"I was reading Major Ed Dames book ""Tell Me What You See: Remote Viewing"" when he mentions this movie being made, interesting insights into RV."
4,crap construction,"The cube was bought for another challenge to me from the original cube. It could be better, as it pops really bad sometimes. It came so stiff that it was impossible to scramble it, let alone solve it. I lubed it with silicone spray and now the thing turns better than my slickcube 3x3."
2,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!,"I ordered the 4x4 after I got bored with a 3x3 and thought I would enjoy it. I really did, but after I started my second run through, I made a turn and the entire thing fell apart in my hands. I am extremely unhappy with the quality of the cube, not only because of the falling apart, but also because it was extremely hard to turn while it was together. It looks like I am going to have to buy a v-cube now."
2,4x4x4 Rubiks cube,"The 4x4x4 Rubik's cube is very hard to turn, locks up a lot, and pops a lot, too.What am i saying ??Well, it's very hard to turn. If you would like to lubricate it with silicone it doesn't make it any better.It locks up a lot - meaning that it gets stuck. You cant turn the layer anymore. You have to twist back or twist other layers to get it back to work. This cube is NOT recommended for speed cubing.It pops , A LOT. The piece come off all the time. I didn't have one solve where one piece didn't come off.I recommend this cube for beginners. Those who never had any experience with a 4x4. But i do not recommend it to those who want to solve it fast or are annoyed by the lockups [ every second turn it locks up ] and pops [ it pops when you have a lockup and accidentally pushed too hard or you're turning the layers very fast ]"
2,horrible quality,"a corner piece broke off the second i started playing with it. i was able to snap it back on, but eventually one of the middle pieces fell off on a plane and i never found it. horrible durability! invest your money on a better quality cube"
4,Great addition to my cube addiction,"This is a fun toy for any cube addict. I ordered it, then read all of the reviews about how it doesn't hold up. It seems to hold up just fine for me. It does take a bit of getting used to because the mechanisms don't work the same as a 3x3 but it moves quickly now that I have broken it in. I'm a big fan of the 3x3 and wanted the challenge of the 4x4. I was actually disappointed in that challenge. It took some time to get the hang of the 3, but the 4 was a little too easy to figure out. The 4 takes a bit longer, but it doesn't seem to be quite as fun as the 3 for some reason. In any event, it's a lot of fun to have a couple different ones around to play with."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"when i first got the cube cube it was really stiff so i was thinking you just need to play with it and it will loosen up, but it didn't in fact it just got worst! In just 3 days the stickers started peeling off, it always locks up pieces are always popping out. and 4 days later the green center piece broke off!!! I bought Rubix because i love my 3x3 despite reading bad reviews and comments i didn't believe them so a waste of money not worth it at all! I would say the only up side to this i for me to never waste money on rubix again!"
2,"fun at first, but stiff, and it will fall apart","At first, I thought it turned pretty smooth besides the jams here and there. Some pieces ept popping out, so I found myself smacking them back into place. I wish V Cube would make a V cube 4 already. It was a little stiff here and there. Can be frustrating. Not bad for a 4x4x4, but I'm trying to find better.I got pissed because the other night I was doing some speed solves and I was getting close to getting under 3 minutes finally, but suddenly it snapped and like half the pieces came out. It's totalled. This cube is finished. I'm pissed. If you don't cube as much as me (like maybe one to five solves a night) then you're straight. Get it... But I solve cubes literally hundreds of times in a day b ecause it's so addictive. This is not hte cube for the 4x4x4 realm."
1,junk,"I had this for about an hour and one of the center peices broke off. I was pretty peeved. I ordered a Lanlan 4x4, hopefully I have better luck with that brand. Do not buy this brand, it's pretty fragile."
2,Steer clear of the Rubik's brand Rubik's cube!,"If you are at all familiar with the larger rubik's cube, then it is no real shocker that the Rubik's brand is not the best option. These cubes are pretty expensive, but very poorly made. It is prone to break easily, but even if it doesn't, the motion is not smooth at all. The stickers will wear out with a solid week's worth of play.Your best bet is to track down an Eastsheen cube (best bet is on eBay) or to wait for V-cubes to release their version.If you are already stuck with one though, replace the stickers at [...] and browse online for a cube-lube (again, eBay is a pretty reliable source), or even just a silicone-based lubricant. That ought to get you some decent use out of it."
2,Quaite a bad cube broke and not my fault:/,"Not a very good cube not satisfied not what i was expecting from a rubiks brand and its one of the most expensive 4x4x4's out there really not worth it(especially when my cube was faulty) good seller got the refund, so yeah."
2,Don't bother...,"With the resurgance of the Rubik's cube over the past several years, it brought me back and with kids elementary and high school age I wanted to re-experience the fun of 25 years ago with the new generation so I purchased some Rubik's brand cubes. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 to share with my kids. They have been a lot of fun. The Rubik's 3x3 is just as I remembered it. A bit stiff at first but with time (and a little silicon lubricant) it loosens up nicely. My 11 year old has already mastered that one! The 4x4 is a real disappointment though. Very sticky and jams up a lot, even with a liberal dose of silicon lubricant. Also, the 4x4 is very prone to popping cubies when you go too fast. Simply put, the Rubik's brand 4x4 makes me tired. The Rubik's 5x5 performs better. In my opinion, don't waste your money on the Rubik's brand 4x4. Instead, get a much better value from purchasing an Eastsheen 4x4."
2,Do not buy this,"I solved this cube 2 times and while I was on my 3rd solve one of the pieces popped out, So like the 3x3x3 I just popped it back in, but when I did this one of the centers snapped off and the cube was broken. I now have a QJ 4x4x4 and it is one of the best you can get. You can get it for about 14$."
3,Interesting read of one person/significant others experience,"Having neared completion in therapy for this suvival skill I am always interested in anothers experience and viewpoint. When reading this if you are a person who dissociates I hope you will realize that your experience may be different. It is crucial that you find a therapist that understands dissociation and is willing to learn the correct way to work with you. Perhaps that is the most important message of this book. Anything you read that helps explain the abusive cause, this survival skill, and helps you realize that it in not a crazy persons illness, is worth taking the time to read. For those therapists who still doubt the existence of this ability you should not be treating surviors of abuse. The book suggests you refer to someone with experience and I agree. Thankyou to the authors for making that point clear."
4,Really easy read and informative,"I really liked this book. It was definitely an easy read, and manages to keep things interesting. The information is definitely more geared towards someone who was perhaps recently diagnosed or suspects that he/she might be suffering from dissociative issues, as it is pretty basic and not very in-depth. It seems like a great book to have significant others and family members of those with DID to read as well. I really enjoyed reading the book and it was a page-turner."
2,third rate repitition,"Though easy to read, this book is devoid of any true scholarship and skews the fragments of information that it reports. Basically, Burnham and Phelan strung random theories together into conclusive pop psychology/self-help by ignoring contextual parameters on the theories themselves and counter-theories. Their narratives appear to be correct because they were initally structured to conform to observation. The only things were undeniably correct were neurobiological (such as their section on the science of addiction) rather than about evolutionary psychology. For the given subject matter, I would find less dictorial books that present competing theories and their evidence."
1,Made to order!,"Agnostic conservatives everywhere:Do you find the Doctrine of Original Sin to be politically expedient but metaphysically questionable?Harvard and UCLA professors Burhnam and Phelan have just the solution you've been looking for. Evolutionary psychology explains why man is rotten to the core - and what you can do about it. Your antisocial behaviors and ethical lapses are not your fault - they're not even EVE's fault - they're YOUR GENES' fault. What a clever idea!And that's not all! Evolutionary psychology explains why others are even more flawed than you - WITHOUT RECOURSE TO that messy doctrine of the Fall of Man.But wait, there's more! Years of wisdom from both Ann Landers AND Dear Abby have been condensed into one slim volume, with SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE behind each and every precious nuggest of advice. How could you pass this up?Order now! Satisfaction guaranteed..."
2,Yeesh!!!,"Another writer with a political agenda, trashing the 'Establishment'(a 60's hangover?). If you like gore and fantasy, believe Hollywood is leading us to a better way, and think 'common sense' is over-rated, you may enjoy it..."
5,Classy Thriller,"I just finished reading ""The Dead Room"" and was totally knocked out. This is a classy thriller written by a new writer who grabbed me from the start and never let go.The side-story tribute to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch was a nice touch, too. (It has to be Bosch -- who else works in Hollywood, lives in the hills, and takes trips to Florida?)Very classy work. I highly recommend ""The Dead Room"" to anyone who loves the genre. It's as good as it gets."
4,Four & a half stars,"Haven't read any of this authors crime books before, so I bought solely on the customer reviews. Not disappointed - a good fluent read, kept me page turning, and some nice twists and turns that weren't too obvious. Recommend it to those that like a solid detective/homicide thriller."
3,Bad Editing,"This was an ok story. There are others out there that are better written. The editing is atrocious, the supposed killer was first introduced as a brother of the wife of one of the main characters. Later in the book the same accused killer was now the brother of the husband. Can't have it both ways."
3,Decent Read Up to the End........,"Too say I didn't enjoy reading this book would be untrue....I did. But there are only so many twists an author should make and the ones that come at the very end are disturbing. I like to know how things end. Not beforehand but when I read the last sentance and put the book down, I need to know how it ended. This is one of those books that you finish and say........so what happened here? Now what?The book was entertaining and better than the title leads you to believe. I would recommend it but am still wondering how it ended....I guess it's one of those where you put your own ending on it."
5,Excellent Read,"Ellis hits the mark in this tale of never-ending twists and turns - right up to the last word. Well-written and -crafted, the writing is superb. Dead Room is a novel Philadelphians will especially enjoy!"
