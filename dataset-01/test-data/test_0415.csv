4,A Surprisingly Easy Read,"Having struggled through Crossan's ""The Birth of Christianity"" I had several second thoughts on tackling this one. However, the shorter length of this book and the subject matter proved too much for me to resist. As a result, I am very glad that this was the case.I found the book much easier to read that the earlier mentioned book as well as providing me with some solid background and understanding of the times in which Jesus Christ lived and in the communities in which he and his disciples moved.If Crossan scares you...don't let it. If you are looking for an interesting historical account and understanding of the times and culture into which Jesus was born, then this is a book that will be to your liking."
3,B-Mobile,The item arrived well ahead of schedule...and there were no shipping charges. That was good. The item was not in good condition...part of the wings were bent and still are after three weeks of use. The beard was glued on upside down...I pulled it out and replaced it with a new one. I did not complain to the shipper as I needed the item and made it work. So far....I have not killed a turkey over it...but that is not the fault of the product. I would recommend the product...but not the seller. It was supposed to be new and it is...but it is clearly a second.
5,A Great Read Even If You Don't Believe,"I read this book on a cross-country flight(quick and well-written read). It made me feel safe to pursue my own quest into the possibilities of 'life after death'. This is a must-read for anyone that has lost someone close to them. It really opens your mind to the hope and possibility of communicating with those who have left us physically. I consider myself to be a pragmatic but open-minded person, and would welcome the oppurtunity to meet with a medium and see what happens."
3,Quite disappointed,"I was disappointed because I thought the book would describe the life there is after death. Instead it's just about a spirit, who had just die, came back to be with his family/friends. He didn't reveal much information about the spiritual world. Since I believe in life after death already, I don't need to spend [the money] to buy a book that tells me there is life after death. It's quite expensive for a small book.This is actually a good book for people who have lost their love ones. Maybe they'll find peace knowing that death is not the end in itself but just a transition into another world. The dead is happy and at peace in the spiritual realm and that someday they all can be together again."
4,"Great Book, Now What?","I couldn't put this book down. Is Mr. Dalzell going to write sequel, I wonder? He should because there are so many great TV shows, like MEDIUM and PSYCHIC DETECTIVES, and I like the way this book links wild personal experiences to science and a potential afterlife. I still have so many questions. But this book offers a lot of answers."
4,An Honest Review,"I received my copy over the weekend. I started to read this book. My initial reaction on one of the pieces was to put the book down. I had to because that particular piece made me cry. I picked it up again, and had to put it down again. The next one had me on the floor rollin with laughter. I picked it up again. ""Only in my Empire"", reminded me of my relationship or the one I wish I had. Great book.I went thru so many different emotions during my read. And after I was done, I went back to it to read it some more. I did notice that there were certain pieces that I gravitated to, these are my favorites.This book is shorter than what I wanted to see. Big ups, because it's just that good, that I wanted to keep reading.Beautifully written. Definitely relatable on all levels. A must have for your literary shelves."
2,"Plot drags, is too repetitive","Parts of this book are funny, but it drags amd drags, and gets annoyingly repetitive. Reads like a first draft. Needs an editor."
3,"Camera Protection Good, Lens Protection useless","This camera armor protects the camera body and screen well, and I recommend that part. But the Lens protection is useless, here is why:1) It blocks the light sensor when using flash2) It doesn't hold well at all on my telephoto 55-200 VR LensSo therefore I can't use it when using flash using my shorter lens, and it doesn't hold onto the longer lens. I have contacted the company via e-mail and they have confirmed this. If you are just using this to protect the body, go ahead and make the purchase. Also, the lens protector is soft so it is easy for something to bump it and if pushed in enough, it will hit the lens."
4,Only one flaw!,"This is a great product. It has saved my camera (Nikon D40) from getting scratched. The only problem was with the cover for the lens. When I took a picture, the lens cover created a shadow in my pictures, so I just don't use the lens cover. Overall I would recommend this product."
2,Not a bad product.,"mmmm, what can I say about this item. I didnt really need it. Thought it would be a nice thing to have. I wish I would not have spent the money. Not that is a bad thing, its just something I really didnt need and do not really see the purpose. But whatever, I have it and will continue to use it. I will tell you this, its a good converstion starter. Anytime i am out taking pictures peolpe think I have an amazing camera. I own a NIKON D40."
4,Great Camera,The only reason for the 4 star rating? Limited selection of fully compatible lenses.Over all performance? I could not be happier. It's a Nikon! what more can I say.I must admit that the Canon XTI was a real thought.
4,Satisfied,"I purchased this protective covering because I am not to gentle in the way that I handle my camera and to keep it in the best condition possible for trade-in value, the armor will help alleviate some of the concerns I have about nicks and scratches.It is very affordable and doesn't hinder the operation of the unit. Very functional purchase from Amazon."
3,Great for a NEW MOM and someone who needs step by step info,"I bought this book thinking it was a great organizer and journal. However, its more for a new mom! It gives great information on what the baby would need and what a mother would need in the hospital, however, there is little room for appointment journaling. It does not ask you the little tidbits you might want to remember for later in life, such as, the first kick, cravings, feelings.. etc."
3,Sunshine63,It works and I will keep it. The board is very light so if your CAT weights a lot like mine you may need a stronger one and not this one. My cat is about 15 pounds and this is really pushing it so they should have a weight limit on the advertizing. Over all.....happy!
1,Stay away buy a different companies cover,This cover does not even stay on the pool. Not only will it not stay on due to the air vent holes water collects on the top of the cover and in falls to the bottom of the pool. Totally defeating the purpose of a pool cover. Very disappointed with Intex's products at this point. Once again money wasted and the company has no concern for the customer.
5,Love it!,I love this cover. It was so easy to put on by myself and it fits perfectly. Does not come off in the wind is tight and secure!
4,"Excellent material, well-written, and extremely useful !","This book constitutes an extremely useful tool and pleasant reading, for those interested in Israeli and Middle East politics and society, as well as travelers to the region (especially during this turbulent time). It is excellent to have a view from the author about the current Middle East crisis. While clearly standing on one side rather than the other, the author remains extremely objective and without any bias, in examining the causes and perspectives of the present Middle East crisis - a topic he clearly feels very strongly about. The book is extremely well-written, ensuring pleasant and captivating reading for all. Likewise, it contains extremely useful and up-to-date information, which will be of immense value for the traveler. It is a book any traveler, especially if interested in politics and society, should take with herself / himself before leaving for the region."
5,Wondering reader,"I spent a lot of time in my high school library. I would help out in there during my freshman, junior and senior years since I had study halls those years. My senior year, I remember helping put books away while also looking for my next book to borrow since I read all the books in my house. That was when I came across Nightmare by Joan Lowery Nixon. I remember it was the cover that had caught my eye originally. I was like, ""Hmm. This looks interesting."" I stopped what I was doing and began reading right away.I couldn't put this book down. Just a few minutes before the bell rang I check the book out and must have gotten yelled at by my teachers to put the book away or they were confiscating it at least twenty-six times. I loved this book and had Mom read and the both of us fell in love with it. Joan Lowery Nixon became one of my favorite writers along with Stephan King, Stephine Meyer, Jane Austin, Edgar Allen Poe, J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien."
2,"Interesting plot, but terrible writing!","The book description pulled me in, but Nightmare turned out to be a childish, flat book. The plot was slightly innovative, but the author ruined the book's chance for success by using terrible dialoge (the characters used phrases and words that no one would use in real life) and flat, unreal characters. Basically, the novel read like it was written by one of the high-school kids in my creative writing class."
5,Fantastica Aventura,Puede que no a todos les guste.Pero esta llena de situaciones que a todos les pasa.Me queda claro que soy fan de Amanda Peet
2,A lot like a boring movie.,"I agree with most other reviews, the two main characters lacked any chemistry. Why would the company in NY give money to Oliver's company after that horrid office presentation....The whole idea of a diaper company did not help the movie at all and was not needed, in my opinion. Very boring movie to sit through, but fun to make fun of if you are with a group of friends. I think a much better love story, similar in design to ""A lot Like Love"" is ""My Sassy Girl"""
2,Boring,"I found this movie to be a bit slow. Cute at times, but mostly uneventful. Although many love stories are similar (somewhat slow), i found this one took me too long to finish cause it was just one boring line after the next. Just my opinion.Much better dialogue in movies like 'Maid in Manhattan', 'Love Jones', 'Notting Hill'..."
3,A Lot Like Life...,"I found this movie to be a lot like life... I could totally relate to much of it, and it's light-hearted romantic humor made me smile. I did not feel this movie was hilarious, or one I would like to see repeatedly, but it was a good, light hearted movie which I enjoyed once and might enjoy twice."
3,Okay for a rental,"I made the mistake of seeing this movie on the big screen. I wish I would have saved my money and rented it instead. The plot revolves around Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet's characters. They become friends and then go to a party together. They loose each other at the party. This pretty much happens over and over again until they finally get together at the end. It is pretty much a dumbed down version of When Harry Met Sally, without the witty dialogue and great acting."
1,Awful!,"I have read several Jude Deveraux books, and I can say that this is not only the worst Deveraux book I have ever read, but pretty much the worst book I have *ever* read. The writing is stilted and unnatural; the story contains none of the sass and romance that Deveraux's books usually do. Stick with the ""Highland"" series -- ""Highland Velvet,"" ""Highland Song,"" etc, and don't bother to pick this one up. It is so unlike any other Deveraux I have read that I cannot believe she wrote it -- and the copyright of ""Deveraux, Inc."" only helps confirm those fears."
2,A Rewrite of Other Books,"Jude Deveraux is one of my few forays into the genre of romance. I was attracted to her when I heard another librarian debunk her even though they were classmates in high school. I knew the public loved her titles and were eager for each new addition.THE MAIDEN is a wooden story, neither Jura or her secret knight Rowan go any where in the story, nor is there any insight into the centuries old tensions between England and Scotland. It is not one of Ms. Deveraux more memorable titles.Nash Black, author of 2009 Indie finalist WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,A must read,"With characters like Jura and Rowan how can you go wrong. Jura with nothing but physical attraction, and absolute dislike for Rowan finds herself stuck to in marriage to this outsider. Rowan from the first moment he meet Jura wanted her like he never wanted anyone else, and at every corner tried to pull her into his arms. With a battle of wills they clash head long into a whirlwind of adventure and love. A wonderful story that will leave you breathless and wanting more. (And who can resist the magical setting of Lanconia, ""The Princess""'s heart warming land.)"
4,"Works great, a must have, but cost alot.","I bought my Jabsco 17800-2000 Porta Quick Oil Changer used because I checked all over and the internet for the lowest price and it was still over $150 bucks. I payed $85 plus I bought a extra impeller for $22, and redid the hoses with longer and clear with new ends, add another $10. All in all I think this pump works great but cost about twice what it should.I would suggest if you're going to be using this just for your car to go to like Menard and buy a 25 foot long 1/4"" OD hose for about $2 bucks and try it down your dipstick to see if it works on your car. This will not work all cars and those with round cable looking dipsticks. Also if you need to jack your car to get the filter off you may just as will pull the the plug and be done."
2,Wouldn't Recommend....,"My main issue with this remote is the ""TINY BUTTONS"". The remote is jammed packed with features and will control just about anything you have in your entertainment system. I couldn't get it to turn off my PVR, I programmed it to do so and when I pushed the master off button it would not turn off. So there you are with the remote display reading ""Harmony remote thinks all components are off"" is this correct? if not press help. Then you have to walk through the questions, ""is the TV off? yes/no, Is the VCR off yes/no, Is the PVR off? yes/no, you select no and the remote asked Is the PVR off now? Yes/No. Finally the PVR Turns off. The remote is back lit, however since the macro buttons are colored it's difficult to read in low light situations. I've returned mine to Amazon. Would not recommend!"
2,Mine has never worked well,"Got it two months ago and it crapped out on me last week. I was continously using the ""help"" button and I hate to say it but am somewhat releived it is going to a better place (trash).Besides not working most of the time, the buttons were very small and hard to read ( I am over 40).On the positive, when it worked, I really liked it as all my AV gear is linked together out of my room and this was a great thing, when it worked. I am off to find a new universal that does everything this one claims it will!"
4,Too bad it will never happen,"I'm not as economically savvy as the previous reviewer, so I'm not qualified to critique the details of Murray's plan. But this book represents ""big thinking"" -- the only kind of thinking that can solve the big problems we face. I'm grateful to Murray for producing this book. But I am a pessimist, or perhaps ""realist"" would be a better term. If Murray's plan -- or anything remotely resembling it -- is ever floated before the general public, it will be doomed, doomed, doomed. Politicians who recognize that their political power would vanish along with the welfare state would go into full Demagogic Fear-Monger mode, screaming that the plan would only benefit rich white males while pushing women, minorities, and children into poverty and insecurity. Enough voters would buy into that hysteria to keep this plan from ever seeing the light of day. And thus we will spiral farther down towards socialism."
5,Great Pan - Easy to Use,"I love this pan! I used it for the first time yesterday and it perfomed exactly as I hoped it would. Followed the directions to ""oil"" the cups - I used PAM - and the muffins just slid out with no problem. Clean up was a breeze and it is ready to go for the next time. The sled keeps the pans from bending and makes it easy to take in and out of the oven. The muffins also looked very professional - no breaks or pieces missing."
5,Great Muffin Pan,"I love this muffin pan! There is no need to grease it, and the muffins come out beautifully - nothing sticks!This is my first silicon bakeware purchase - I was hesitant to buy silicon for a long time - I'm always suspicious of ""weird chemical stuff"". But then I figured - teflon is a controvercial chemical too, and I use it all the time, so why not give silicon a try. And I'm glad I did!There was no weird smells or aftertaste, the muffins were absolutely normal. Also, the wire sled makes it really easy to put this pan in and out of the oven. To wash this pan, I just stick it in the dishwasher - so easy!I am now using this muffin pan all the time, and my old teflon muffin pan is gathering dust. No more greasing, paper liners and hand-washing!"
5,best for baking!,"I was pretty hesitant to try a new baking item, but these muffin pans are wonderful! The cleanup is super easy, there is no problem getting the baked item to slip out, and I don't have to worry about rust or tarnish. I would highly recommend this type of new bakeware to anyone who loves to bake, but doesn't love to clean."
5,Creative approach to training manual,"When I bought this book, I thought that it contained the usual simple training exercises that you find in the majority of training manuals, but I was impressed by the fact that everything is written in a format that makes training easy. I am a business manager and am take training very seriously. I have been able to incorporate these exercises into my training plans. They are reproducible. My staff has given me very positive feedback about the contents. Jon from Sacramento"
2,Olympus Microcassette Recorder,"I purchased this product and found that it was of relatively poor construction quality. After reasonable normal use the cassette door hinge broke. I elected not to send it back for repair as my need for this equipment passed, but I was surprised that such a key element of the recorder would be so fragile."
3,Bad sound but good concert,"Note that this also comes in a boxset called ""Flight Box"" which also included the 2 CD set called ""Last Flight"". ""Last Flight"" has horrible sound quality and is even worse than this.This is a concert from 1969 after the album Volunteers was released. I think that it a very good show with a great song selection. The band sounds good and is harmonizing well.The problem is the sound quality is bad and it makes it hard to enjoy the performance. It also makes the band sound bad and sloppy in parts. I put the sound quality at the very bottom edge of what I can listen to. I would give this 5 stars for performance and knock it down 2 for sound quality. Others may think the sound quality is too bad to make this worth getting, and they could be right.This was released by Charley, which only releases bad sounding CDs. They have released many live CDs that sound even worse than this. Even re-issues of studio albums by Charely sound bad."
1,The worst baby name book ever,"This was given to me as a gift--I would never have purchased for myself. One quick flip through reveals its limitations. As another reviewer accurately stated, it is a dictionary at best. But most annoying was the author's habit of not listing the meaning for names, instead saying ""a variation of..."" causing one to have to flip endlessly to another section just to find a simple two word ""meaning."" My favorite was for ""Nicole"" where one had to go all the way to ""Nicholas"" in the boy section a hundred pages away. One of the most unhelpful resources of any genre."
2,Hard to read...,"I was very disappointed in the book. Many of the names are duplicates with variations of spelling and it gets very frustrating to read after a while. There may be 93,000 names but less than half of them are unique."
1,Under no circumstances I'll subscribe again,I did subscribe but definitely will not renew. This magazine is out-of-style for my taste. But there's hope reader...buy or subscribe to Crochet Today magazine instead.
1,Pathology,"I still don't have the movie. You guys show you sent it, but I don't have it. I would love to review the movie if I had it. Can someone contact me via email and let me know when it is coming?"
2,Not smoked salmon. Baked salmon that has been smoked.,"When I ordered this product I thought that it was smoked salmon, as it is labeled on the package. However when I got the product it was not actually smoked salmon. True smoked salmon has the texture of raw salmon because it is cooked with smoke instead of temperature. This salmon is cooked with temperature and then is either smoked or has the smoke flavor added. While it does taste good, it is not 16.00 or so dollars good, and is not what the labeling leads one to believe. Not a full one star because it is a good quality fish, if you want to pay that much money for it. But again, it is not true smoked salmon."
1,Not for the music,"The music itself is great. Everybody knows Surfin' Bird from Family Guy and King of the Surf is a great track as well.However, my copy came pretty badly warped and I didn't even notice since I didn't play it for about a month after buying it. It was packaged well, so probably a manufacturing error."
5,A BLAST FROM THE PAST!!,"WOW THESE CLASSICS ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE HARD TO FINDHOUSE IS HERE SNATCH 'EM NOW OR PAY FOR IT DEARLY OVER SEAS $146.00OR MORE GET IT NOW I GOT MINE?...THATS ALL THAT MATTERS NOWWHOO-HOOO! ""LOS NINOS!!BABY! HA,HA!"
3,A bit disappointed,I love The Savior by the same composers. Was a bit disappointed in this collection. Not what I expected. Not as good.
1,Not so great,"I thought stainless was better, Not! After one time through the dishwater you end up with streaks and stains. If I had known, I would not have bought this item. Also the quality of the workmanship is not up to par. Made in China. Enough said."
4,As much as I liked this movie ...,"... I didn't love it, and of the 4 Bob Hope movies I own so far (Monsieur Beaucaire, The Princess & The Pirate, Casanova's Big Night, & Road to Rio), this is my least favorite of the 4. But that isn't bad, all things considered, it's still a very good movie. Somehow, the humor to me just wasn't quite as good as in the other movies I mentioned, but it's okay. Worth getting the vhs at a low price."
5,One of the great comedies of all time.,Hollywoods best comedy writers of the period collaberated and came up with a Bob Hope vehicle unmatched in his career.Lots of fun and hearty laughs throughout.Classic cast.
1,an apt summary,"This movie is like lousy porn, but without he sex scenes. And pay no attention to the other reviewer's comparison to "" tacky movies like the Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Unlike this movie, the Rocky Horror picture show had thing like actors, an non-handycam video recorder, and a story written by a writer over the age of fourteen."
4,I LONG TO OWN THIS MOVIE!!!,"Seeing this movie in all it's ""horror"", i.e the acting, the story, made me cringe the first time I watched it. But because it is sooo lame I need to own this movie. To show people what bad movies are made of. Don't hate it because it's bad... LOVE IT because it's sooo bad..."
5,Helped prepare for Officer's School,Helped my son greatly improve his score on the OCS exam. Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
4,"Very good, but high alcohol","As an ayurvedic medicine user I was suspicious of of any other kind of herbal medicine. The medicine seems to have just all kinds of herbs, including some typical content of ayurvedic medicine like licorice. I was concerned if some cocktail of herbs thrown together will work.I was more concerned with 25% alcohol content. That's to me like drinking whisky. Thanks to reviewer- Kalindi's tip of putting it in hot water and let alcohol evaporate.So before giving to my 8 year old I tried 1 spoon without evaporating alcohol. It was slightly hard on stomach. I didn't care about flavor nor did my kid.We gave it for three nights and coughing was gone. Now my kids coughing has never gone away in 3 days. It did go away, though on 3rd day kid complained little of heavy stomach.A very good medicine, except for high alcohol I would say. I wouldnt give it to my kid if she were younger than 6 year."
4,Excellent choice,"Very easy to use and to set up the answering machine. Speakerphone worked fine, even talking from several feet away with back to the speakerphone. However, I recommend recording the outgoing message by calling in remotely from another phone line instead of using the speakerphone. You will get a clearer, crisper sounding message. This phone was far superior to two previous AT&T cordless phones I had."
4,"Tiny, but nice","I know the measurements are provided, but I must be dimensionally challenged because this was much smaller than I'd pictured! It's nice looking, but unless it's a Reader's Digest, a magazine doesn't fit in the ""basket"" and you can only fit a few rolls of toilet paper or a couple of towels folded up tightly on the lower shelf. I gave it 4 stars because, on mine at least, the ""basket"" wasn't made right so it hangs off center and looks weird."
1,Not the same quality as I'm used to.,Got these gloves because I had a pair of the grey ones and I wanted them in black. The grey ones I have are a few years old and have held up well. These were made with a different neoprene and started falling apart with standard wearing almost immediately. The ones I received also look a bit different than pictured. not sure if they're still made by Kenai. These are garbage don't waste the money.
2,NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS,"I have passed some Microsoft exams using Exam Cram 2 books as my sole study resource--that will always be the standard by which these books are judged. This book falls far short.This book introduces you to the various topics on the 70-305 test, but does not cover a single topic in enough depth to be worthwhile. The review questions and practice exams are weak, also."
2,Frustratingly Incomplete,"It looks like the book was rushed out the door. While there seems to be some good information in it, I was repeatedly frustrated with the end of the chapter tests asking questions that were covered nowhere in the book! Then when I did the first of the included Prep Logic tests, some of the answers were opposite of what was stated in the book. If you can't be consistent within the scope of the book it really throws it's reliably into question. Don't plan on using this as your sole resource."
3,Forget the tests,"Ok....just did tests at the end of chapters 1-3.....if your criteria for success is a correlation between the text and the test...........FORGET THIS BOOK....if your criteria is learning something new in the text of the chpters...this book may have redemption...I won't know till I take the test....but I will say this...it has new info I have not found elsewhere, but still don't know if this new info will help me pass the test, which is after all the main purpose of the book......SOOOOOOO.......where do I stand on this book?.....don't know yet at this point.....BUT........has info I have not found elsewhere so for 20 bucks it may be a deal"
3,"Not bad, but not that great either","This song isn't bad by all means. The only problem with it is that you'll get bored after playing it over and over again. Thus this song has very little replay value. I think Natasha's voice could have been a bit forceful with this song. This is a pop song, so if you're a trance fan/diehard, you'll definitely want to skip this one because there is absolutely no trance in it. However, if you do have a little inkling towards pop, you might want to check this song out. Don't be shocked if you're disappointed.Keep in mind that ""Why"" is Natasha's second song. Hopefully over time, she'll mature to be a great Euro pop icon."
5,CONNECT activities are just plain awesome,"As a student, I believe that the CONNECT online activities for this book are outstanding. They are much more effective than the online study aids I have utilized in other classes and with other texts. CONNECT is simply the best way to engage with history, and the exercises, quizzes, and critical missions greatly enhanced my learning experience in the classroom. They're interactive, and they're fun. I found myself remembering information and making connections that I would not have been able to draw up had I only read the text itself. A+++!"
1,Moronic movie that could have been very good,"Some of the interview subjects in this movie are interesting individuals, others self-absorbed adolescents, but Ms. Arquette is essentially inarticulate and doesn't seem to know how to conduct an intelligent interview. Her interview subjects offer some interesting insights, especially into just how shallow some of them are, but Arquette isn't responsible for drawing them out. The interviewees present their views mostly well in spite of Arquette's ineptitude as an interviewer. Most often her ""questions"" aren't really questions at all, but rather range from sycophantic exclamations to inane observations about herself.Avoid this turkey."
4,What is the prime?,"The reviewer here says that Winger is special because she...'bows out during her prime.' Wrong! She sees no pictures in which women can act in their prime! During the entire film it is observed that as women age, of course they get better at their craft. But they cannot use these skills, because the thing that is prized above all in Hollywood in 'f*ck*bility.'"
2,BORING,"Don't buy this, I did and sold it back. It's okay to watch once maybe, but not to buy. The first 30 min are pretty good,but the rest of the film are just the same old thing and nothing really interesting. BLAH!"
4,WEIGHT LIMIT,"After spending way too much time searching online the weight limit for this is 250 pounds. Why it's not in the description, who knows?"
2,This is hard plastic,"This finger saddle snaps on and off the flute as described. . I was surprised that it is hard molded plastic with no rubber or cushioning on it. It would need to be taken off each time I put my flute in the case and I am afraid the process of taking it off and putting it on will scratch my flute. I developed tendonitis in my left hand index finger and felt this would help my tendon heal. However, I am not willing to risk scratching my flute to solve my problem. I am looking for another way to cushion that finger. I have the Solexa Thumbport and that is coated in rubber to prevent scratching a flute when it is snapped on or off"
2,cute but it hurt my ear!,"My husband liked the looks of this phone and so did I. Unfortunately, we did not like the ""feel"" of the phone - it did not feel comfortable next to your ear - in fact, it sort of hurt! Also, we echo other folk's comments - it echos! Our cheap old phone sounds better. Finally, our 15 month old daughter was able to erase our carefully recorded message in just one push of a button. (and we spent so much time getting her to say something on it!!!)"
2,Flavor Is Just Too Strong,"My wife mentioned she missed the old black licorice bars that used to be around when we were kids. I found these on line and ordered a case of them because of the good reviews. Neither one of us, or any of the three other people who tried them could get past the first bite - the flavor is just too intense."
5,Definitely Definitive Guide to Premier Editions,"Great book for discussing the advantages of the Premier editions. If you are looking for the basic quickbooks user guide, then you need ""Quickbooks 2004, The Official Guide"" (which covers Quickbooks Pro & Basic). However, you need this book in addition to ""The Official Guide"" if you own a Premier edition and you want to get the most out of it. The information on importing in ""Chart of Accounts"" (and other lists), setting up ""Item Assemblies"" (complete with assigning additional costs beyond just parts), and ""Tips for you industry"" are all well worth the cost of the book."
1,Faded Glory,"I've used ATM Deluxe since it first appeared. It was great under OS 9.But Adobe decided not to update it for use with OS X, and under Classic in OS X it's a dud. If I'm in Classic and want to add or remove fonts, ATM runs so slowly as to be virtually useless. Luckily, my G4 can be rebooted in OS 9 native, so that's what I do to make Classic font changes.ATM also slows the opening of my Classic environment. It takes about one minute for Classic to initialize with ATM Deluxe activated.I've had more trouble over the years with ATM Deluxe and/or Type Reunion. From time to time one or the other becomes corrupted and wreaks havoc with my computer's entire performance. Reinstalling is the only solution.Unfortunately, there are few alternatives to ATM in Classic.Mac G4 867 MB, 1 GB RAM, OS X 10.3.9, OS 9.2.2."
2,No me gusto!,"Esperaba otra calidad, es muy aspero el material y del diseño.. ni hablar! Definitivamente, no lo recomiendo."
5,Grand Entertainment,This film barely lasted a few weeks in New York City and I traveled three hours from Connecticut to see it. It was worth the trip. If you like swashbucklers this one's for you. The story is rather intricate but the film moves along fairly quickly and Daniel Auteuil is wonderful as the hero. There is a lovely relationship between Auteuil's character and his daughter.Buy or rent this one--you won't be disappointed.
4,Favourite Poems - Vol 2,"Book was a gift for my mother who grew up in Glasgow, Scotland and Donegal, Ireland. She got a great kick out of the poems she had to memorize as a child and she still remembers quite a lot of them verbatim. She enjoyed it immensley."
1,NOT the Original Recording,"I bought this thinking I would hear that perfect song of the lateseventies (Fool If you think it's over), perhaps his biggest US hit, and it wasn't that version! You may be disappointed. Luckily I was able to re-sell it. Wait for the original album to resurface, if it ever does."
2,Defective binding,"I purchased the book for my daughter, It arrived safely packaged, but the cover is on upside down!! The book is still usable and she will keep it for reference after she graduates, but I certainly would not have chosen to pay full price for a defective book. Can't return it, classes start in 2 days, just have to put a book cover on it to make it right side up again."
1,Picture shown is totally different from actual plug.,"The item I received was TOTALLY different from the picture shown. I received the correct part number (Dorman 65240 AutoGrade Oil Drain Plug), BUT, the actual part (labeled ""65240"") is a ""toggle bolt"" type of plug that requires internal clearance in the oil pan for the toggle to gab the pan from the inside. My Honda Civic does not have the necessary clearance inside the oil pan. The picture of the 65240 INCORRECTLY shows an expanding rubber type of plug that is tightened by a wing nut. Hopefully they will correct the picture for this item. I assume they will exchange it at no charge & if not, I'll follow up with another review.Follow up:Incredibly, the item they exchanged it with was THE SAME ITEM. The representative I was corresponding with (""Rafi A."") (via email) was courteous and prompt, but he apparently didn't read my message which gave the part number that I wanted in exchange (a Dorman 65200)."
2,"Big on Merchants, Little on Immortality","If you're looking for a book describing what it's like to be a research scientist in the academic world, or if you're looking for a detailed history of stem cell politics, this book is for you.However, if you're looking for cutting-edge science, exciting discoveries, and an up-to-date look at the modern day ""quest for the fountain of youth"" - look elsewhere. You may eventually find some of it, but not without wading through pages of tedious ""personal struggles"".This book fits far more easily into the ""Biography"" genre than the ""Popular Science"" category."
5,The best webcam for PC's,"This webcam is very responsive, gives excellent image quality and the software some have complained about from previous versions is now in excellent shape. The sound quality is equally excellent. Extremes in lighting conditions cause the webcam some indigestion, but it will soon settle down. I found the image to be surprisingly stable when I jostled my laptop. It also follows me around as if there's someone inside watching me. This webcam is truly worth having if it's quality you want. If it's compactness, this is not the one for you, but Logitec has a number of smaller, more compact webcams specifically made for laptops."
2,"if you like em large, this camera is for you","this camera is huge and the bracket is even bigger. although it has good clarity of picture, the ungainly bracket and overwhelming size limit it's use to desk top computers."
1,Below average 640x480 cam....,"Sad. This is a average to below average 640x480 cam. There is no 4MP resolution as advertised. The best resolution it will do is 640x480. The rest is software produced which is not included and I still have not found yet. I am sure it wouldn't make the images much better any how. Scam, scam, scam. Avoid."
4,Love it,"My husband bought me this mixer for my birthday and I love it. The only complaint that I have is that it is hard to snap the bowl into place. It is much more convenient to use one with a head that lifts. That said, I love my mixer!!!"
1,I don't get the hype,"I have had this mixer for several years. Purchased it on sale thinking I lucked out. Like the other low ratings, the paddles don't reach the bottom or near enough to the sides. I'm constantly stopping it, ""dropping the bowl"" so I can get into it, because you can't while it is running, to scrape down the sides. I too have given up half way through to mix by hand. The enamel chips off the sides of the paddle after some minor use. I called kitchen aid and they said I could purchase another paddle for $14.95 + $6.95 S/H. Are you kidding? While accessing the model number for teh rep, I turned the machine on it's side only for it to leak some sort of brown motor fluid/oil on my floor. I'd rather have my Mom's old Sunbeam any day."
5,14 years and still going strong,I have had the professional mixer for over 14 years and I still love it. It still works beautifully and never had a problem I barely had to replace the mixer attachement but otherwise then that is looks as good as new. I loved to bake as a child and received this as a christmas present from santa when I was 8. Seems a little strange but I have loved it.Make sure you get the proffesional series if you want to bake breads and make large vats of stuff. Great for mashed potatoes!!
5,KitchenAid Heavy Duty 5-Quart Mixer,"The KitchenAid stand mixer was ordered during the holiday madness and was received within 4 days, which was a very pleasant surprise. It was packaged in the original shipping box and was in great shape. Since it was a Christmas gift, it was not used until after Christmas. It is something I would recommend to anyone that cooks and bakes. A must have item for any kitchen."
4,Works for me!,This was the perfect solution for me: the application was for remote controlling of a woodshop vacuum system. The idea is to just carry a wireless remote to turn on/off the vacuum system so that I didn't have to go back and forth to another room to turn the vacuum on/off. I got this for well below the MSRP a while ago and it still works fine.
5,Legolas adult small costume,"Arrived earlier that expected! Great costume! I purchased this for my son (who happens to have long blond hair) and is a little over 5 feet tall. The tunic and cape are terrific as well as the wrist cuffs boot covers worked well to complete the look. Fortunately, my son already owns a bow and arrow set as one does not come with this costume."
1,Boring,"I really expected more versatility out of this book with the title. I suggest reviewing it in person before purchase, to see if this is what you're looking for. The color combinations I found to be very muted."
1,Not Wha I Expected,"This book may be good for looking at changing your paint color, but was not helpful in picking out a new color pallet for a newly constructed home."
1,not as useful as expected,"I purchased this book with the hope it would give me some ideas on how to paint my condo. Unfortunately, I spent more time fussing with the pages so they would line up instead of getting ideas. I think the concept is good, but the execution could be done better. Overall, I would look elsewhere for ideas on painting your interiors."
1,"What a joke, does absolutely nothing, don't bother!","Well, it's just a glorified headband. I guess you could say it holds your hair in place. No response from seller. I tossed it in the trash."
4,reads like a movie,"Lately I've been in a ""reading rut"" and decided to branch outside of my box. I've never read a romance novel so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to explore this genre. I've read this author under the name of Wendy Corsi Staub and loved each book. This book did not disappoint me.It's a romantic comedy about finding love when you least expect it. While reading this book I could picture the characters in my head and have been trying to figure out which actors/actresses could play the parts.If you're looking for a light, fast read, this is the book for you."
2,Sub-par,"I have these as my front and back surround sound speakers connected to a Onkyo 606 7.1 receiver. I have a different center speaker and sub-woofer. These speakers are sub-par. Terrible for music and just ok for HD movies. The sound is muffled and sounds like they have to much base. Really, they are no better or possibly worse than the speakers I was used from the Sony HT-DDW790 Home Theater in a box system which was only $200 for the whole thing in the store. Those speakers seem to fit the need better then these ones. The center speaker I got which is suppose to go with these speakers, also sucks."
4,Large sound for small space,"I bought these speakers to place behind the Living Room couch so we could listen to music in the main part of our tri-level house. Until now, we had some very large (and old Polk Audio Monitor 5) speakers which we just did not have room for any longer. These Sony speakers fit our needs well."
5,"Great little speakers, great price","I bought these speakers as ""B"" speakers for my stereo and they certainly are little gems. I'm through spending a lot for speakers and most other audio/video components; they don't last any longer than less expensive ones, don't offer better sound for our needs, and it feels a whole lot worse when an expensive piece of electronics dies or becomes obsolete. Based on the excellent performance of my Sony SS-B3000 and the SA-W2500 subwoofer,I got these for my stereo and a set of SS-CR3000 center and rear channel speakers to connect to the TV, so I'm all set for surround sound if we ever get a larger LCD TV. The sound from all of these units is crystal clear and perfect for our small home, and the prices are excellent, especially if you watch for sales."
5,Great Speakers,I have really enjoyed this speaker as rear channel speaker. It really does all you need. There is great information at www.audiogon.com as well if your looking other info. thx
4,Good Speakers...Great Price!,"I got these speakers as a gift. I have a sort of frankenstein sound system (no matching brands) and I like sony products for the most part. These speakers are hooked up to a 30 year old amp/receiver and they sound great! I can't imagine how they might sound if used with a proper unit. I'm not setting up a sound studio or an elaborate homme theater experience so these speakers fit my purpose. I gave them four stars because I wish they had mounting points for speaker stands in case I wanted to change it up a bit and the wire provided only gives you about four feet per speaker. I don't know who thinks that is a perfect length...maybe if you live in a walk-in closet. Besides those two minor issues, they are a great buy!"
4,Powerful package,"The shipment arrived promptly and in great condition. To my surprise, not only is the size and visual appeal of these powerful speakers great, they are an exceptional value."
2,Small,I returned the speakers because they were too small for my CD Receiver so I had no choice but to return them. They looked good and looked sturdy just too small.
5,Nice speakers for a nice price,"It took a few months for me to get these in but it was worth the wait. Nice bass response and nice enclosure. For the price this is very nice set of speakers. As a reference, my main theater system is Klipsch RF3 system (RC3, RS3, etc). But for my living room I only needed some bookshelf speakers and these work great."
4,Very nice~!,"I needed satellite speakers with good price, and this is the hands down winner.My original 8"" Infinity book shelf speaker's woofer was breaking apart - no complaints, 18 year old speakers - and needed a cheap replacement.Don't expect big bass for this size of speaker.Best bang for the buck~!"
3,Average speakers,Given their modest size they cannot produce earthshaking HiFi sound quality but as back speakers for a surround system - in conjunction with Pyle Mini 2x120W amp. - they are acceptable.
3,Solid quality at a low price,"For the money, these bookshelf speakers can't be beat. Much more bass response than I expected, as well as clarity and depth. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase."
3,Too Expensive,"These are good for their size as a mini-stereo system. They can't really handle bass at higher volumes(it vibrates and crackles), except for maybe a very small room. I was replacing some older Sony speakers, but the old ones are way better (of course the older ones are 6.25, not 5.25, and they had bass, medium range, and tweeter cones on each speaker). I will probably get the old speakers repaired. I don't know why Amazon bumped up the price to $100. I bought it here for about $40 about 3 weeks ago. These are definitely not $100 speakers."
5,Good buy,For the price this is a good speaker set. Very compact size but sound is good for it's size.This were purchased for my elderly mother-in-law who is quite pleased with the sound and the price.
2,Be careful about price to performance ratio here!,"For $69 this pair of speakers is fine for kids and people who don't know what they should be listening for. There is no ""brightness"" in the sound (it's ""muddy"") and the best way to describe them is ""tanky"" sounding. Seems that a rule of thumb is that you have to spend $100 or more in this particular bookshelf category to get the wonderful ""presence"" of sound that lights up the room. I had to send these babies back. Sorry."
5,"Great, because I know how to use them","I'm not what you would call an expert at anything really, but I do know quality. I added these to a 7.2 system I have for all my TV gadgets. I see reviews all the time about how things don't live up to the hype, or can't get what they want from a product, and that's their deal that they don't know how to do stuff. These are no doubt the most affordable speaker you can buy that deliver the best quality possible for this price unless you are buying used. I highly recommend this product for your home theatre or stereo. The other speakers in my setup are Pioneer fronts, Klipsch rear, Sony surround(ones I'm reviewing), and Sony sub. I have them setup so they sound all identical even though they are different brands.It comes with about 5 feet solderd(spelling?) wire to get you started if you're using them as fronts."
4,Small Sony speakers Good Enough!,"Just purchased and set up a 5.1 living room theater / music system with these little speakers as the left & right front and L / R surrounds. For $50 per pair, they sound surprisingly good. I know good sound. I'm an experienced musician. I used to be an audio nut. Owned expensive speakers made by boutique small shops.My wife did not accept the idea that our new living room sound system was going to be populated with 4 PSB Stratus gold Towers, plus the Big PSB center channel speaker below the 47 inch LCD monitor, so I bought the Sony little speakers here, along with the CN 5000 center channel and the 12 inch Sony Subwoofer. I'm breaking them in right now with various rock and folk recordings. I can live with the sonics. The speakers are clear voiced, have no annoying dips or peaks in the audio spectrum.Again, these speakers are an amazing bargain for $50 per pair."
4,bookshelf speakers,this pair is good enough for my computer. at least it is loud enough with some clarity when powered by an outboard amplifier compared to the generic ones that came with the computer but definitely not for a serious hifi set-up.
1,1 speaker broke within 30 days of use,I bought these on Black Friday for the wife to give me as a present. On Christmas I set them up and they sounded great for their price. Within one month I started to hear a muffled sound and it turns out one of the speakers is bad. Sometimes it sounds muffled and sometimes no bass plays at all. Obviously something is wrong with the speaker. Since it has been longer than a month I can not return to Amazon and now have to deal with Sony.
3,not a music maven,"I replaced old large floor speakers, so these were a great space saving choice, sound is OK, but not much base."
1,One can do better,Simply not worth the cost; suggest you look elsewhere. Do not be a fool---as I was.
3,Impressive but chelation didn't work for me,"This is a very well-written book, by a very credible professional, and documents case histories of people whose cardiovascular problem has been solved by chelation with EDTA.On the basis of this book, plus a couple of others, I got the details of an approved chelation therapist near me (UK) through Dr. Cranton's website, and after due diligence (checking with the European chelation accreditation HQ in Holland etc.) I started the treatment at a clinic in Surrey, England.I can only say that, after 28 3-hour EDTA chelations, and with all the attendant blood & urine tests, mineral supplements recommended, plus my own lifestyle (always have eaten healthily, taken plenty of exercise) my cardiovascular condition has not improved, and so I'm now turning back to my local hospital for the angioplasty (stent) that they recommended a year ago.Good luck with chelation, folks. It didn't work for me."
3,Agree with Mr. Leach,"This novel is a mixed bag, and it's stayed with me for some time since I first read it. On the plus side, I found the book an easy, wonderfully quick read, and a pretty good exercise of world-building. I also found much to like in Ecotopia's vision, such as its environmental policies and progressive educational system, etc.BUT...there is something decidedly specious about the ideals represented in the book, and in truth it was sometimes hard to tell if Callenbach was being sincere or satirical. Valid objections about the Ecotopian timeline aside, as well as its obvious hippy vintage, Ecotopia's almost enforced diversity--albeit in a non-bourgeois lifestyle--passive-aggression, and occasional totalitarian structure make even a tree-hugging, bleeding-heart liberal like me raise an eyebrow. Ecotopia sounds like a place that's better than Hell, but still ten floors below Heaven.Recommended, but with a grain of salt; definitely not a play-book for the perfect society."
1,Uncomfortable!,"The moment I slipped these on, I knew they were going back. The thong upper with all the stone decorations, was stiff and uncomfortable."
3,The Yeast Syndrome,This book is good if you have spent thousands of dollars and still not well.It is easy to understand and helps with dietary changes to help get yeast out of your body.
4,Nice craft project,"Well built furniture, endless possibilities, especially if you skip the pastel paints and use your own. Daughter loves it."
5,DEAF CHILD IS THE BES,THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT. MY STUDENTS AGES 12-16 LOVED IT. IT'S AN EASY READ AND A BEAUTIFUL STORY ABOUT DEAF CULTURE
5,Purge is awesome,"Purge rules, it is probably the best team based game since tribes 2... It has great classes, the technology versus magic is cool, some of the weapons include crossbow, a sword, an axe, a microwave laser, chemical weapons, frostbolt... ect... There is cool leveling, skiills... like Ion Barriers... Nano Generators, Faith Healing, gaurdian spirit and more.. you get to completely customize your character.. how he deals damage.. how he takes damge... his speed, his inteligence, ect"
2,Good Subject Matter With Outdated Statistics,"This book contains a wealth of information on the deviant youth subculture. Unfortunately, it uses grossly outdated statistics and research. There is no excuse for claiming to discuss and explore the current youth subculture using research from the mid 1960s and statistics from the early 1980s."
1,"For anyone studying adolescents, stay clear of this book","This book is grossly misinformed. Wooden makes no attempt to study his subject. Rather, he regurgitates things read from letters and pamphlets. He describes one stereotype after another and makes very broad generalizations that would get a professional in trouble. In particular, his chapters on Satanism and the Punk movement sound just like a Donahue episode. He never even speaks to a punk. Instead, in his chapter on Punks, he reads letters from parents and others who have been affected in some way by Punk, obviously biasing the research. That is only one chapter I could pick apart. In conclusion, Wooden is very out of touch with the real issues being presented. I am very angry I bought this book and am surprised he was even published. The fact that he is an award-winning author makes me want to become a writer."
4,boom banka boom ching ching....,I had this ALBUM year's ago & loved it for one song (Infidelity)....FINALLY heard the song again after all these years & know I know why it always stayed with me....
2,lone ranger episodes,"This was not a good buy at all. The copies were done poorly! some of the episodes run out before the end is presented. The quality is so poor it's less than fair. THIS IS NO REMASTERING OF THE LONE RANGER EPIC...THIS IS A VERY,VERY, POOR COPY JOB OF ORIGINAL EPISODES...DONE BY SOMEONE THAT IS LESS THAN AN AMATEUR!"
1,"Ridiculous book, which wasted my time!","All the reviewers are 100% right that this so called ""book"" is complete wasting of time and money. If you are also entertainer my advice is to buy Cruise Ship job in 14 Days. It helped me to get a job in 15 days and after 1 week I am flying to Fort Lauderdale to join one of Carnival's cruise ships."
4,Pretty darn good,"This is my first cb radio and it has been a learning process, but I love using it. I finally have it setup the way I want it and it works great. Mr Electric"
2,Superficial,"This book gave the feel of being hastily put together. Of all the career change materials I've read for lawyers, this was the least helpful. The profiles of individual career changers were fun to read, but I wish that the book offered more research and real practical advice."
4,King's Best Work With A SciFi Twist,"This book showed more economy of writing than any other King book I've read, yet neither the prose nor the story suffered from incompleteness. Absolutely a great plot, built upon a great premise, which I'm afraid to describe lest I give too much away. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the characters seemed built upon cliches."
3,The Langoliers: It's like a Stephen King Survivor!,"Are you into a good, sci-fi book that makes you feel like you are right along with the characters. Well this is one, and one of the best! If you like movies like Cast Away and Back to the Future where every scene leaves you wondering what you would have done differently or how you would have acted, things of that sort, well this is the book for you. This book brings together a bunch of characters who are all different and you get to see what happens when they are introduced to a problem, a BIG problem.It's almost as if this is a Stephen King Survivor! All of these people are all different, but they find a way to try and bond together to solve the problem. Will they bond together and help solve the problem, or will they all go crazy and die out with everything else. You'll find out when you get The Langoliers!"
4,Informative and Enlightening!,"I found the book informative but not very insightful. Kalpana's writing is quite engaging and her descriptions are interesting. I liked the content in general, though I would have liked to see her throw some light on what we can learn from the way Dharavi has shaped and grown. It would have been interesting to see some comparitive study with other big slums in India.It is to her credit that she went over Dharavi's history through various angles. The book was a good read. I liked her notes on how people moved, how the industry slowly transformed. In some ways, the growth in Dharavi is an experiment in liberalized growth without any regulations. It can lead to both rapid growth and chaos."
5,Requiere to fin in place,"It is always important to fix very well, you Will need extra f this if you do not Want noise in your car"
2,"Good Live Album, however,","Do not buy this cd/dvd if you think you are getting the separate DVD type features, this 'dual-disc' is very misleading. It has one track that is a live performance, all the rest in dvd form are just tracks with a still-frame picture from the concert. To top it all off, the cd part will not even play in my cd player on my computer, so you can't even load this album onto your hard drive if you wanted to, or copy it onto a blank disc. I have a G4 Mac, and...I tried it on some newer PC's and they wouldnt read them either. So, to sum this up, don't buy the dual-disc version, buy the regular cd, and if you want the video, buy the DVD separate."
1,boring,This book does not do it for me. I own 3 of Nancie's books but I haven't been able to find one tasty recipe out of the whole book.
3,Good recipes for indian and thai,This is a reasonably good recipe book for Indian and Thai cuisine. It is easy to follow. It has a nice variety of choices to cook. It was a step up from what I had worked with before. I am just starting to cook Indian and Thai food.
4,excellent book with delicious recipes,Coincidentally I made the Thai Green Curry with Shrimp and Snow Peas last night. The recipe was easy to follow and the only change I made was to use one less tablespoon of curry paste. This is another wonderful recipe in another of the author's wonderful cookbooks .
1,very disappointing,"This book does not have very many interesting ideas - certainly nothing elegant or ""new"". The focus is on ""make it yourself"" craft projects, though the instructions for making the things are very general (no step by step instructions or templates to use). They are also ""low end"" ideas, as if the author assumes you don't live near a good craft store or that cost is very important to you and you don't want to spend ANY money on favors and decorations.If you are at all ""crafty"", you will not be inspired by these ideas because you could easily think of something better yourself. However, if you're on a tight budget, and/or you don't consider yourself very creative, perhaps this book will give you new ideas or encouragement to try to make something.Equivalent ideas for the food and games suggested in this book can all be easily found for free on the Internet..."
3,Powerjolt car charger whistles,"I have found the Griffin Powerjolt to be effective, but when I play the iPod while it is connected to the charger (via the iTrip) there is an audible high-pitched whistling that can be sort of annoying. The good news is, the iPod powers up pretty quickly when attached and when the battery life is sufficiently extended I can disconnect the iTrip from the charger and the whistle goes away."
1,terrible,"The first one I purchased two weeks ago didn't last 15 minutes (the time-set knob broke off as soon as I tried to set the time). I returned it and got a second one which lasted 5 days, when the second hand fell off.Coleman makes good camp stoves. I congratulate them for that ... and will stay well clear of their watches."
3,just ok,"This seems like a nice watch but it wasn't what we had hoped for. The quality is fine but the watch is facing the wrong direction. If it is going to be hanging on your belt, it should be ""upside down"" so you can read it without trying to twist it around."
1,Utter Nonsense,"I bought this book years ago on a whim. What a mistake! It is without a doubt one of the worst books on stones I have ever read.One of the more amusing things it says is that black tourmaline is useless other than perhaps for helping potted plants grow. Aquamarine is good for getting your energy up and amethyst as well.I have worked with stones in a metaphysical way for over 20 years and laughed my way through most of this book once I got over the fact that I had actually spent money on it!Said to be channelled by a group from the Pleiades, I truly think that the writer needed to change the channel."
1,P.T. Barnum was right,There are a few women with whom I have relations yet always it seems at their desires. I purchased this to try getting them onto a schedule I wanted and have found it to be 100% ineffective. I can still have relations with my ladies on their schedules but have never found this to have helped. Used on myself with each of them several times on an 8 day schedule to a 0% success rate yet when not using success rate is still based on their desires.
4,Good sound for the price,"I installed these in an older vehicle, along with a new radio. They sound good for the price, although I hear a little bass rattle occasionally even at relatively low volume.It's probably obvious to everyone but me, but there are two speakers in each quantity-1 order.a"
5,Great Sci-Fi,"Ok...I'm not some Sci-Fi nut who's gonna cite little nit-picking points about the saga or the ongoing storyline...What I am going to tell you is that this book, with it's gender role reversal, descriptiveness, and localized storyline....Was enought to keep me happily page turning...This was a great book, well written, imaginative, and easily stands alone from the rest of Asaro's books...Nuff Said."
2,My least favorite recording,"This certainly is a good example of how subjective music perception can be or how random music reviews can be. I bought this CD after reading all the incredibly positive reviews here. After listening to it, I couldn't be more disappointed and embarrassed. I find some songs here excruciatingly slow and drawn out. I don't enjoy the sound of Mrs. Davrath's voice (to me, it often sounds thin and shrill) or the sound of the orchestra, and some of the woodwinds sound outright amateurish (nothing wrong with that at all, but frustrating on a supposedly professional recording).For anybody who wants to get to know these songs, which are among the most beautiful pieces of music I know, I would urge considering the unbelievably wonderful recording with Frederica von Stade, or at least the very professional and popular recording with Kiri Te Kanawa."
3,Good information but barely legible,"My great grandmother was a Gladding so I looked forward with interest to reading this book. The information is good, but the print quality is extremely poor (if you are expecting a new, updated printing, you'll be very disappointed). It looks like it came from a copy of a copy of a copy...you get the idea. The same publication is available online."
5,Review of Cardiac Cartel,"A fast reading thriller, sure to make a great movie. Looking forward to other works by Dr. Mucci."
4,Very informative.,"The biography of William Hartnell, written by his granddaughter Jessica Carney, is very informative and very interesting. I was really only familiar with William Hartnell's work on Doctor Who and was fascinated reading about his childhood and how unhappy he was growing up. I never knew about his personal life, and I'm sure not many other people did, and was amazed at what William Hartnell did. I think Jessica Carney did a real nice job writing about his life and tied everything together in a way that was enjoyable to read. I learned quite a lot about William Hartnell and would recommend this book to any fan of Doctor Who or anyone who is familiar with William Hartnell."
4,Actually Available....,"Not exactly a dynamic recording, but still relaxing. Actually due to the fact that it's just a single track, albiet a one hour track, it's on iTunes for just 99 cents since it was entered as a single ""song"" album."
4,My godson loves it.,I bought this for my godson's 2nd birthday. It's durable so he can't break it. Now he's also talking more.
3,Great toy,"I think this is a great toy, but at this point my sons aren't too interested in it. The pictures to match up and the sound that results are very clear, the two puzzle pieces are easy to manage, and it doesn't take up a lot of room. Also the noise it makes when you match up the pieces is at an appropriate level."
4,"Entertaining, but hard for a 2 yr old","I bought this for my son's second birthday. He likes it, but it is hard for him to do by himself. His 3 yr old sister can do ut independently."
2,Daft Punk Electroma,"Being a huge Daft Punk fan since Homework, I have loved anything they have been involved in. Interstella 5555 was absolutely amazing, and I thought even though is has no dialogue or Daft musique it should be fabulous. I understood the story and it was quite sad, but beyond that I had trouble paying attention. It's only around an hour long and that was all I can bare to watch. I understand what they set out to do, but good cinematography does not mean a great movie.."
5,Not your Typical Daft Punk,"If you didn't know anything in advance, and you're were expecting to enjoy a movie that really goes along with the album Human After All, yes, you will be disappointed. This is a live action art house flick that doesn't involve any Daft Punk music at all, only the concept of going along the the album viewing two robots in their quest as they yearn to become human and the consequences of this journey. There's no action, there's no dialogue, just an engaging plotline, if you can allow yourself to absorb it."
4,"Arresting inventive visual storytelling, if a bit overlong","A bit pretentious, a bit obvious, overlong, even at 74 minutes (this would havebeen a brilliant 40 minute short), but still full of arresting images and surprisinglyemotional moments.Influenced heavily by Kubrick, Antonioni and most of the great 60s and 70svisualists, this is a wordless film about two robots who want to become human.The action is minimal. The opening drive through the desert alone takes a good 15 minutes.But it's wonderfully shot, and the use of eclectic source music as score(Brian Eno, Curtis Mayfield, etc) is interesting, if sometimes a little tooself-conscious or intrusive.I doubt there are more layers to be found on repeated viewings, I think it is whatit is: an experimental film more full of image than story or ideas. A 74 minute, interesting rock video.But every time I'd head toward terminally bored, an image or feeling would reel me back in..."
5,Juzo slippie gator,"I have worn regular support stockings for years and always had a problem getting them on. Had to start wearing prescription strength and knew it would be a disaster getting them on. When I saw the instructions I thought it would take a long time to get them on but I was able to don them in probably half the time as by hand. The instructions really are easy, much easier than it would appear. I would recommend getting the gloves as they still need some smoothing over the legs. I do love this product and feel that I am getting the correct compression rather than hand pulling up the stockings and having excess material at the top."
5,great shampoo,"your hair feels just right after washing, nice tingle feeling as it lathers up. Also rinses nicely"
1,This is whack. Total trash; outrageous price.,what else can I say ? This junk really blows. DP had nothing to do with this product; this you can be sure of.
1,any good reviews?,"No, because there aren't any! didja think bush is a liar? the guys that promoted this album are worse!The marketers of this dvd are unscrupulous, methodical, deceivers.This dvd ranks #1 as far as being the greatest ripoff of all times.You are a loser if you buy it.I don't usually offer reviews but i felt compelled to inform potential buyers not to buy this junk. Hopefully you will be able to buy this album in a dollar store as a buy one get one free special, and you still will be unhappy!I bet I could sue them for false advertising, i can't say enough bad things without being vulgar."
2,just ok,The remastering on this cd is a huge disapointment. If you own the cd from 1984 you wont find much difference in this new remastered version. It's too bad cause this cd needs to be properly digitally remasterd. The 2nd disc has some songs that are just ok nothing really stands out. All in all a disapointing release of a classics 80's cd. Update!!!!!Has anyone got their replacement cd from Rhino yet? Ive been waiting since july 6th and still no cd. Also if anyone got a replacement cd from Rhino how is the sound quality? thanksUpdate!!!!!!I finally got my replacement disc today 15 days after i sent them my info. Sounds good but i never got a e-mail saying it was being shipped liked they promised.
3,Metal Masters of their Day!!!,"With their abrasive attitude, big hair, colorful style and creative looking makeup, these guys were one of the best bands of their day - true metal masters in '84. What ever happened to 'em? As if Twisted Sister's songs weren't crazy enough, they made hilarious videos that really stuck it to parents everywhere!! I'd hate to be Dee Snider's dad!! Remember the part when the little kid started spinning around wildly and suddenly transformed into Dee!! Technology at its finest, back in '84!!Well, if you dig transcendent rock bands that have more to offer than just partyin' type lyrics, this is the band for you. These guys stood up against society when it was un-hip to do so. Also, they ushered in a new era of bands like Aerosmith and Bon Jovi. Thanks for your inspiration, Dee!!!!HOPE YA' LIKE IT!!!"
3,SImple guitar and efficient rock!,"THe guitar work in this album is something amazing. J.J. French and Ojeda plays so simple, it's almost ""childish"" compared to today standars. But, hey, it works!!Snider has a strong voice and the lyrical subject of the songs are very good."
1,Craptacular release,Twisted Sister rip-off. This is a sick joke. What a way to screw your fans. Unless Rhino fixes this problem I vow never to buy another one of their re-releases again. Piece-o-crap!
4,Shock in a CD,"This was one of their earliest CD's they recorded. As I speak of bands that have starter CD's this is what I'm referring to. Burn in Hell is an awesome song that surprisingly talks about salvation and giving your heart to Jesus, if you listen to the entire track. Mostly filled with a misses, there are a few really good songs on here. Burn in Hell, The Beast are among the ones I personally preferred. As they collection of their music grew, it seems they progressed somewhat normally. The songwriting got better. To me it appeared that after their final CD, Love is for Suckers, that they would go on forever as that CD didn't really have a bad track on it, but it just stopped. Underrated band. Loved Love is for Suckers, even though the song itself was written mostly by Marky Carter. This CD made me fall in love with Metal music."
5,What the hell?,All you people crying about how much you hate twisted sister should just shut up! How far does YOUR fanbase expand. This is a great album. Granted its not as heavy as their earlier releases but it still has some great songs.
5,"Nothing wrong with my Copy, it ROCKS!!!","This is a great album to re-release, this is how I remember it growing up only crisper and clearer. Not sure what all the complaints are about bad mastering, my CDs sound great. The new song ""30"" is worth the price of the album, these guys have the potential to still make great music. Sure they went a little off track with ""Come out and Play"" and as much as I have heard ""Love is for Suckers"" bashed, I think that album had some great songs on it. So I'm looking forward to new and great things and I hope I get the chance to see them Live."
3,Rhino replacement disc...,"While Rhino has replaced the defective disc, and it does sound better than the original pressing...maybe the story TS gave us about being unhappy with the mix when they rerecorded Still Hungry was true. The mix really isn't that good, and remastering only does so much. It's still worth picking up for the bonus disc."
3,i broke my controller i got so mad at this game,"at first you're like""wow look at that crash that was awsome"",and you drive into oncoming traffic nearly hitting almost every car. but then you find out how annoying this game is.the only fun level is the first one. every time you crash you lose five seconds from your already rediculuosly low amount of time to get to the next check point and once you lose every race because you crashed twice and couldn't make it to the next check point in time you will find your self saying ""why the heck did i waste 50 bucks on this?!"" acclaim had a good game but put to much focus on the racing aspect of it. if you want a good racing game get grand turismo three and if you wanna destroy cars get twisted metal:black or twisted metal:black online(won't be out for about 3-4 months but has more features than tm:black) all this game is good for is annoying you"
1,Terrible,"Wow this game is terrible. Compared to any other racing game for Ps2. Your better off going with Gran Turismo 3. These Graphics are horrible and the game control stinks. Also it is very easy, i beat it in 3 hours. So don't waste 50.00 dollars on this game. Rent it and you will see how bad this game is."
1,What a joke...,"Not much to say about this book. It sucked. It wasn't really a novel at all rather a series of short stories thrown together in one book. None of the chapters really advanced the story. In fact you wouldn't even have known they even tried if not for the very brief mention of what happened in the previous ""chapter"". I wouldn't recommend this book to a dead dog.I give this book 1 out of 5 stars. Try harder Jonathen Green."
4,Comedy Kings Movie Pack,"I have enjoyed watching these movies. Some I saw a a kid in the fifty's watching the late, late show on TV. Some I never have seen before. I like it."
5,This is IT!,"EFT, TFT, and Energy Tapping are all pretty much the same and this book does a really good job at teaching the techniques. I would recommend going to emofree.com (EFT) and consider purchasing their CD-ROM's of workshop material. It's always easier to learn when you can see someone else demonstrating it for you.I've tried just about everything over the years and I must say this is the real deal... FINALLY. I got my first panic attack, and subsequent depression, when I was 13 and the problems only worsened as I aged. I'm 39 now and my only regret is not having this amazing tool years ago. The long-standing social phobia I had literaly vanished within the first couple sessions."
2,Not so hot,I have tried many shampoos to find one that doesn't burn my sensitive skin and scalp. FFekkai is a well know name but the product is not what I would want in a shampoo. I found it irritating and couldn't wait to shampoo it out and off my scalp.
4,Perfect Beach Read,Beach Blanket Bad Boys is six short romance stories. I read this book at the lake which was perfect to read in between vacation fun. You can pick this book up read a short hot story - with great satification. Found some great new authors!!!
2,Average at best,"I bought this CD because of the Geto Boys song ""Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta"". I like that song a lot, but the rest of the CD is lacking in quality. The other songs that are alright are tracks 2 & 9 for rap songs, and 11 & 12 for um, spanish mambo type songs. This soundtrack is not like the Gridlock'd soundtrack. On that CD, a lot of the songs are terrible, but the few good ones make it well worth it. I'm not so sure that applies for this CD."
3,"Don't own it, but want to...",This is one of the rare albums I'll buy for just a single song. The song that makes this album worth it is Perez Prado's Mambo #8. I could care less about the rest of the songs.
3,Lofty has done better,"I think there are better books on the subject. Lofty should stick to doing books on survival. However, I would recommend this for a beginner to at least start grasping the concepts"
5,A Must read for political junkies who need a laugh,"I laughed out loud reading this book. The satire is biting, but truthful. I have recommended this book to many friends."
3,required textbook,"required reading for my urban anthropology class. Interesting articles, but a little dated and some articles are hard to read"
2,If you get it on your clothes it isn't coming out!,"The stuff is okay...it is basically Desitin with Calamine lotion. Therein lies the problem. If you get this on your clothes, as they say in Jersey, ""Fuggedabout it,"" because it isn't coming out. The company says Clorox 2 will help get it out but it simply doesn't work.While the stuff is cheap it isn't worth sacrificing clothes over--that is expensive!"
3,BRANIGAN 2 IS A GOOD OFFERING FOR FANS,"BRANIGAN 2 is the 80s pop diva's second album and capitalizes on her impressive gutsy voice.I don't think it's her best album but there are some good tracks: the pulsating drive of SOLITAIRE; DEEP IN THE DARK, a reworking of the 80s hit, DER KOMMISSAR; and the emotional power of FIND ME and HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU. The remaining tracks are more formulaic but performed with Branigan's usual gusto. Her future recordings would show her musical maturity and leave a potent legacy."
5,Incredible,The best book of fiction written by anyone in her generation. (Unless A CARNIVORE'S INQUIRY is even better.)
1,don't waste your money,"We would like to be able to support independent film makers such as this but the movie was inferior - the acting was terrible, the story line was unclear, & the sets were not true to life (i.e. female patient didn't have an IV while in the hospital - obvious that it was filmed in a doctor's office, etc). Besides that, they portrayed smoking as acceptable; after church while visiting with other church members, some of the men were smoking. We were so happy that we bought this at a place that would allow returns so we got our money back."
2,Its was ok.......,I really did not care for this movie....just wasn't what I expected...it was ok...my husbnad liked it more then me but he even said it was just ok...sorry won't watch this again...donated it already!!!
4,A very good movie,"The principals in the story provide a guaranty to all for their skillful acting. Hoffman renders quality all around. The topic and drama renders no justice to what sometimes the media finishes without knowing the true ending to religious individuals accused sometimes of missdeeds they do not comit.Mrs. Streep's acting is precise and evoking, as the border between ""doubt"" and ""paranoia"" is well presented and felt by the audience."
4,DOUBT,"Had not seen this before. MARVELOUS acting by Streep (although I do NOT like her in this ""mother of a dog"" role), and the Priest. Good story line, but when all is said and done, there is no proof! I Resent ANYONE who assumes actions without proof, no matter who they are. Good movie. I recommend, but again, I did not like Streep in this kind of a role.Cecy Ivie"
2,Yawn....didn't keep me engaged or entertained,The movie was just ok. It apparently received nominations for awards but I have to admit that I caught myself yawning a few times during the movie.
4,"The Horror! The Horror! (flashbacks to catholic gradeschool, that is)","So for anyone who had that special of an experience in catholic gradeschool that they now consider themselves anything but catholic, watch this movie prepared. The nuns are square on - cold, heartless and terrifying (save for one good hearted one). Ah, but without continuing this personal expose, this was a great film about some of the worst tendencies of human nature - gossip. And the priest delivers a fantastic sermon on gossip with a great allegory. My wife and I actually discussed this one for several days debating on whether he did it nor not. That's the mark of a good story for me - giving you something to debate. As much as I dislike Hoffman, he was great and played the role perfectly. And Meryl Streep is, as always, fantastic, but with an accent that wavers a little in its believability."
4,No Doubt About It - Greatly Acted Suspensful Drama,"It was a pleasure watching two of America's greatest actors play a mellow, perhaps molesting priest and her doubtless antagonist nun go at it in this thoughtful and suspenseful drama, the adaptation of a Shanley play. Bravo! Bravo! The meaning was left ambiguous, and was a clever comment on the controversy swirling around the Catholic priesthood today about which there can be no doubt."
3,"Not Bad, But Not His Best","Cut Loose, Paul Rodgers' first record after leaving Bad Company, finds Paul playing every instrument. The thing of it is, he's pretty good at all of them. However, he's not great at any of them. As one would expect, though, the vocals are incredible. This album servers a a good mid-point between the Bad Co. material, and the later Firm material. The second Firm album, Mean Business, actually contains one of the best tracks off this album, Live In Peace. Overall a good album, but Paul would prove to be capable of much more..."
4,Ankle Warmers,"Actually I bought them for my husband, because his feet are always hot and his ankles are always cold. These made him happy."
1,umm what?,"As a black woman, i am constantly on the search for helpful hair care books. I thought Fletcher's book was the answer to my prayers, until I actually got it in the mail. What a tremendous waste of paper. Generic, vague, random and rambling, this book truly gave little to no real knowledge. and mr. fletcher's own personal product advertising section was just insulting! I mean really! thank goodness amazon has a great return policy!"
2,boring,to me bow wow's taking up where kris kross left off featuring jagged edge this is really for kids.
2,how could she?,"okay, so i loved the cover. that's the reason i took it out of the library, but i was in for a surprise. i very much disliked the horificly boring storyline, i know donna jo napoli could have done better. she's usually such a good aurther. i do recomend the book 'zel', so find that and take a look at it."
5,YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL OBVIOUSLY STOOPID!,"THIS IS A TOTAL TATY ITEM!!! NOT A BOOT LEG, GO TO THEIR SITE, IT'S THERE, GO TO ANY SUPPORTING NON-BOOTLEG TATY SITES, IT'S THERE, BUY ANOTHER TATY SONG WITH ""Zaschischatsya ochkami""IT'S THE SAME SONG!!!YOU PEOPLE DON'T KNOW REALY TATY, THE CD IS NOT BOOTLEG, ALL SONGS SOUND GREAT, IT'S A TOTAL RUSSIAN TATY CD...BTW, YOU KNOW TATY IS A RUSSIAN GROUP, RIGHT?!COME ON, STOP BEING STOOPID, IT'S A GREAT CD, WITH GREAT TATY SONGS! DON'T LEAVE A REVIEW, IF U KNOW NOTHING...THANX!!!"
2,Agenda Driven,"I felt ambushed by T. Sturgeon after I finished this book. It starts out as a fun, interesting time-travel adventure, but as the novel goes on, you get the uncomfortable sensation that Sturgeon has a sexual/gender agenda, and he certainly does. I liked a lot of the inventiveness of the little bubble-world, but stepping back from the book afterwords, it really is a perverse little bubble world. After finishing the book I went back and read his introduction, and Sturgeon strikes me as a bit of a nasty man. And what was the deal with the ending? Was that actually a nuclear war that was dropped like an A-bomb on the final page for no reason other than send the reader off with a bad feeling??I'll give it two stars for colorful scenes and events but I felt Sturgeon purposely laid a downer on me."
3,"A thoughtful, entertaining look at gender","As a women's studies graduate and a science fiction writer, there's nothing I enjoy more than the combination of the fantasy genre with a discussion of gender. That said, I cannot classify this novel as either a feminist or anti-feminist work. I believe that the ambiguous political nature of the book illustrates the complexity of this incredibly enjoyable, thought-provoking tale.The differences between Charlie Johns' gendered world and the non-dichotomous sexuality of his host society, the Ledom, are both heightened and diminished by Sturgeon's exploration of both cultures' determination of sex, or absence of such, by technology and work roles.If you think that an examination of 'male' and 'female' should be integral to utopian fiction, then this is necessary reading."
2,If there were a translation of the translation....,"it might be possible to make these projects. It's a beautiful book, with lovely pictures, but the diagrams are too small and don't give enough detail. The materials lists are not very useful either. Unless you are an expert already, I would not reccommend this book."
1,receiving less,"The Iranian saffroan that I received was about 1/16 of what I were suppose to get, which was 1 Oz."
4,Horrible game,Boring and stupid are two words that come to mind. Don't bother. Zero redemming value to this game.
5,www.rockangelz.com,"This website is awsome. It talks about the Bratz girls, you can even hear their songs. Their songs rock. their is even a music video about the song So Good, it sounds awsome. I like Change the world. Just go to www.rockangelz.com. It's amazing. I love it."
5,ENJOY WORLD'S HISTORY FROM A CHALLENGING PERSPECTIVE,Churchward wrote in early 20th Century .His book is excellent for adults as well as teenagers who want to see the world's history from a different standpoint.Just imagine !
3,Works for the most part. Very slow response times!,"I was hoping that this remote will replace all of my other remotes and it did, however, it presented with a different set of issues:(1) For my HK receiver, I cannot change the sound mode without going through a dozen button pushes(2) The response time for even basic Channel & Volume buttons are VERY slow!The only best part of this remote is that with the push of 1 button, it turns On (and Off) all of the various components of my Home Theater system but after that I end up using the unit specific remotes."
3,Logitech Harmony 676 Universal Remote Control,"I believe this model is a few years old. It was somewhat easy to program but it didn't work so I ended up having to call customer service. They were very helpful and patient but for some reason my system posed significant challenges. It took well over an hour for the remote to get programmed correctly. Now that it is programmed, it works most of the time. Some of the time one of the devices will not turn on or off and I have to go into the manual mode but that is easy to do. All in all it's better than the five remotes I needed to run my system but it would be even better if it worked as advertised all of the time."
5,Just Wonderful,"My remote for my brand new Lcd Tv went out in less than two weeks. With no way to control the Pip or go to my Vga or Dvd inputs without moving, I was miserable. I did a search for universal remotes and this one popup with great reviews. I could not wait for the shipping process for the ""676"" or the replacement and went to Best Buy and got kill on the price compared to Amazon. I dont care this remote is ""Just Wonderful"". I didn't know anything like this was around. Just tonight I learn how to customized some of the buttons to match my orginal remote. This is just Wonderful. I ordered another one of these through Amazon this time for the Living room. I don't like taking remotes from rooms to rooms. Just be patient and this will replace the orginals"
4,good remote,"Setup can be painful to a non techie but other then that, it's a pretty solid remote. The macro buttons are money and the only quirk I seen is that if you hit the macro button and the remote is not pointed in the direction where all the components can see it, some of the signals may of been missed."
2,Confusing,"I'm not tech neophyte, but I was underwhelmed with this device. I don't think it is any worse than the others, but I was lead to believe that these new Universal Remotes are nothing like the old ones that I personally felt were more trouble than they were worth. While, better, I didn't feel this was worth the effort to learn a new remote."
2,Buttons Stopped Working,This was a great remote for about 12 months. Then the buttons used for the DVR stopped working. It was hard to fast forward and stop a recording and finally became almost impossible. Clearly this remote was not made to last.
3,"Pretty darn good, but not perfect","I really like this remote. The ability to program it using the internet is great, because that allows Logitech to update the software and add new components anytime. It works with all my devices, even my obscure Niro surroundsound system.It's not perfect, though, so it causes frustration for some users. The builtin help guide will generally get you through any problems quite quickly, though.I have one issue: it doesn't want to put my Samsung DLP TV to the proper video input to view a DVD. It finds the place to change it, but loops back and forth before finally failing.At any rate, it works well enough to intrigue me and to look forward to updates."
2,"Warning...You have to disable your router, firewall & virus pgm.","I just got a new 676 as an early Christmas present for myself. Logitech Tech support just told me that to use it, I'd have to disable my router (linksys wrt54g) my firewall (Windows XP) and my anti virus (Avast) each and every time I wanted to change a device. And they offerd no work around other than to return it to the store. Ebay, here I come."
3,Confusing characters but interesting ending,"My review refers to the audio-book version. The audio book is just three hours and all one hears is names being shot at you like a machine gun. After the first five ten minutes I was completely confused as to who is who. It just kept getting worse as the book went on.However, the last third of the book was interesting as everything was explained."
2,"Nostaliga, but that's it","If you like the old NES blaster master game, this one might bring back some fond memories. I played it later in life (after the PS3 was out) and found it very lacking. BM did not take well to the 3d world and the playstation 1 barely does 3d to the point where it's not real fun. The upgrades are mostly to get you to the next level and don't add enjoyment to destroying the bad guys. There are other, better blaster master games out there, but also some duds. Read reviews before you buy."
2,"Works, but may as well be made of plastic.","Out of 12 pushrods to remove, it worked on two of them then one arm completely snapped off on the 3rd. So while it ""works"" for removing pushrods, it is horribly constructed. I ended up not saving any time by buying this and it was a complete waste of money."
1,watercolor books,"This brochure has 26 pages, cost $15 and purports to be a selection of watercolors. Yet all but one is in black-and-white. There was no review but I ordered it anyway. I simply couldn't believe that a brochure of WATERCOLORS would be $15 and not be in color. It was the 2nd order I placed for Thomas Moran's Watercolors within a month, and the other book was also principally black-and white, with a few very bad color images. I don't want either one. You should be more specific with details on what the buyer is getting. I am stung."
4,Good bit o'memory,"Have had this for about a week now and it's been great. I'd seen a couple reviews complaining about noisy drives, but it's whisper quiet. The hard drive on my 40MHZ iMac is louder, so I don't notice at all. One reviewer mentioned that it got hot to the touch: it does get a bit warm if you're doing quite a bit of transfers, but it's not hot to the touch. I did, though, mount it in a vertical position (like the picture) to enhance cooling.The SilverKeeper software works well with my OS10.3. It also comes with a Mac-compatible help guide.I'm happy with it--would buy another La Cie product based on this experience."
5,Timeless music!,"Great CD with wonderful songs that relax you and bring back great memories of the 70s, but disappointed that it didn't include What's Forever For, one very moving song."
1,usa???????,said made in usa the one i got was made in CHINA would not of purchased item if i knew it
2,I kept waiting for it to grab me - it didn't,"While I agree with many of his reasons for homeschooling, the authors writing style was confusing, rambling, and sometimes sounded abrasive. I am a committed Christian homeschooling mom and was looking for a shot in the arm, but didn't get it here. His content is good, but doesn't shine through his writing. I would not give this to a friend considering homeschooling. For a nice secular choice I would give ""What we wish we'd known"" and as far a a book with a Spiritual call to homeschooling, I'll keep looking."
4,Better than most!,"I think this song is very good, and even though I liked it for only a week, its one to keep on hand when everything else gets old."
2,All 'Bout The Money Isn't All About That,"I first encountered Meja in Japan. She's got a great voice and upbeat songs that are really good. I assumed that she must be popular in the US, but no one has ever heard of her here. If you want to get a Meja song, I suggest that you start of with something other than this disappointing single."
5,Meja is hot!!!!!,"Well I never dug Meja's former albums and singles, but this one is really a good song. I only heard this song in Asia, but never played in the U.S. If youv'e never heard this song before, well i guess it's about time you listen to it. Meja kicks Robin's butt with thissong"
2,FUN & DUMB,"This is a great song that you'll listen to all the time for a week. After that you'll get really sick of it, I promise!!!!!!!"
5,Worth every penny,Covers the entire movie with all the music.Wish I would have not bought the sound tracks and bought this first.
4,Not Bad & Condensed,"This is like a condensed version of Malory's L Morte Darthur, the standard bearer of Arthurian subject matter."
5,Love! Love! Love!,This is the best fan I have ever had. IT IS QUIET! The breeze is soft and pleasant and did I mention quiet? Also love the attractive style. Love it!
4,Rebel salute05,"I enjoy the music, there were no swearing, and the artistswere outstanding in their performances, the crowd well behaved...Noel"
5,Yay!,"I have all the Rock Angelz, and I love every single one of them. The only problem I've had with any of them is Cloe' head falling off, but if you e-mail MGAE they'll ask you to send in the doll and they'll fix it!I absolutely love Jade, she's my fave Bratz girl. I also like Jade's singing voice, it's defintely unique (little known fact: Jade is the only soprano in the Rock Angelz! The rest are altos).I haven't had any problems with Jade, in fact she is my sturdiest Angel. Oh, and thanks for bratzmania.tk! I like the Mp3z page.*Burnt Zoe and The Toasters* JADE ROX!!!"
1,Bratz Dolls Are the pits,I think Bratz dolls look like cheap hookers and everything you would hope your daughter would not grow up to resemble or admire. What brain thought these dolls up? The quality is also crummy. I hope these are off the shelves and in the garbage next year. Our daughters deserve better.
4,Good Overview of Public Administration,This book gives insight into the decision making process for administrators. It is not the cut and dried process you would think.A must for those in public service.
4,"Universal Themes, Great Performances = A Wonderful Film","Wolfgang Petersen's The Consequence is a wonderful reminder of what great film making is all about. Petersen did not need a huge budget, overpowering soundtrack and special effects to tell a compelling and heartfelt story about two doomed lovers. Instead he was able to concentrate on filming a convincing story while eliciting two subtle yet powerful performances from his lead actors. This is not just a gay interest film; the themes of loneliness, persecution and love are universal and the result is a film that resonates long after viewing.Thank goodness The Consequence has been preserved on DVD. It's a film that deserves to be seen. If it were not for the overly large and distracting subtitles, I would have given it five stars. Buy it, rent it, see it!"
4,Wooden spiral coaster fun,"I gave this to my Nephew for Christmas and he had fun playing with it out of the box. However, he also received a plastic style coaster and really liked playing with that more since there was more to do with it. This spiral coaster is very limited for the price and to build more elaborate coaster will require buying more parts. So there is the dilemma, whether to buy a high quality handmade toy made of wood or buying a cheap plastic coaster made in China. One advantage to buying this coaster is that if your child likes it you could buy other kits that will fit with this coaster."
3,A little wobbly,"We love this after it is all set up. But, when my little boy (age 4) leans over to get another marble started or whatever, the whole structure falls down. It gets a little frustrating/ iritating. It the table MOVES, it's down.We are thinking of glueing it all together. :)It's OK-- I secretly wish I bought the $15 one at Target. It snaps together tight because it's made of plastic.But, it is a cool toy and the marbles racing down the track and through the helix are just mezmerizing to all of us!"
4,Includes some plastic,"My kids (ages 2 to 5) all LOVE this toy. I like it because it's open-ended play and can be put into various configurations. It is a little delicate when it's set up. If the kids get a little rambunctious, the thing either comes tumbling down or gets thrown out of whack so that we have marbles going every which way. This hasn't happened often, though, and my 5-year-old son is already trying to plan new configurations and perusing extension sets.My only real complaint with the Quadrilla is that I was under the impression that the set was completely constructed of wood. There are plastic rings and other bitty parts used among the wood, however, so be please be aware of this if you do not allow plastic into your home!"
3,old first person rpg,"looked weird and didn't move on screen as well as some games, but not like i care... i bought it for someone else."
5,Great Old School RPG,"This is your classic RPG of building of characters, finding treasures and slaying everything in front of you. In less than a week, I have probably played more than 30 hours on this game and I'm not even close to completing it!!! The spell system and side quests bring a whole new dimension to the game. At the same time, you don't have to follow the quests and just build your characters up. It doesn't make you follow one path, which is what I never liked about the Final Fantasy games. Your only path is building your characters up and going further and further down into the dungeon. ROCK ON!!!!"
3,Has A Few Good Songs On It,"I've always known that this album has been very popular. I've never been a big fan of it, but I still think they're are some listenable songs on Out of the Cellar. Examples are: ""Round and Round,"" ""Back For More,"" and ""Wanted Man."" Not a bad album."
5,The quintessential RATT album.,"This is the one that put the band on the map. Although not their first album (or last), it is in my opinion their best. A far cry from the Aerosmith cover band they started out as. Even though they did cover Aerosmith tunes on the first two albums, the guitar duo of Robin Crosby and Warren DiMartini put any lick Joe Perry ever did to shame. Very few of the 80's rock bands showed this much talent. It's a shame that the major labels turned their back on these bands with the appearance of the ""grunge rock"" movement."
4,"very good, but doesn't match Dancing Undercover","the solo on She Wants Money has to be an all-time rock guitar standard-DeMartini at its very best. However, I find some of the songs to be a little too raw, Dancing Undercover really defined the Ratt'n roll sound of the '80s..."
5,RATT IS AWESOME!!!!!,This cd is one of Ratt's personal best right next to invasion of your privacy. This is just an all around great cd. I could go on and on about this disc so I'll just make it short and simple..... if you are a 80's headbanger get this disc!!!!
5,amazing,ratt is by far my favorite band. this is their best work although invasion of your privacy was also a great album. this has all the feel of a good hair metal band plus a lot of talent. anyone who likes 80's metal even more if you love hair metal and glam should listen to this. ratt is by far the most under rated band of the decade. they are one of the kings of the genre and anyone who likes motley crue or quiet riot needs to check out ratt!
5,Best Flat Iron,"I love this flat iron...its cut my getting ready time down to 20 minutes which is great cause I have 3 small kids. Its really bailed me out of a bad hair cut too. It makes my hair really straight, soft and shiny! LOVE IT!!"
4,Replacement,I have always loved these flat irons. I bought this one to replace my last one that I had for over five years and i strightnen my hair almost everyday. I dont know if they are the best but they have been my favorite out of all I have tryed. They are very smooth and don't catch the hair on any weird edges. If you aren't picky (like a hair dresser or something) this is a great straighter.
3,A pretty good flat iron.,It does the job but there are better flat irons out there. I do like that it has a temp setting though.
3,After 3 months it craps out,"I loved this flat iron, it kept my hair shiney and pretty and didn't fry my hair, but after 3 months it crapped out. The light would blink on and off and after messing with the cord for about 10 minutes it would finally turn on. Every time I used it it would take longer and longer for the light to stay on, I finally gave up on it and I'm buying a different brand."
2,Not a good product,I bought this straighter for my wife 2 years ago. Last summer the plates started chipping and turning white. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The manufacturer said that had a bad batch. That don't make these like they used to. They're trying to save money and rip us off.....skip this straightener
1,Not the answer,"I am also a Catholic priest. Here is a man who was rector of a seminary. Yet he takes no responsibility for the current problems. Instead he dares to offer advice. Penance would be more appropriate. I would ask him ""why didn't you fix the problems when you had the chance as rector?"" and ""why if there is a problem with homosexuals in the priesthood did you not take action and expell them?"". The answer to our problems is more fidelty not less. Fr. Cozzens is part of the problem not the answer. For the real answers we need only look to Pope John Paul II. If we had simply done what he has asked us to do for years we would not be in this situation."
3,An ok book on tactical puzzles,"There were plenty of chess puzzles to learn from. I found that the order that the puzzles were set up to work on could have been switched around for better learning purposes. I also found some mistakes in the solutions and some typos. I enjoyed ""Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors"" by Hays and ""Winning Chess Traps"" to be far more helpful books."
5,A unique and instructive chess puzzle book for players rated 1300-1600.,"This chess puzzle book contains 100 pages with 9 chess puzzle each page. Each page contains 3 checkmates, 3 material win, 1 defence, 1 planning and 1 endgame problem. The solution part is very instructive. So this is high class chess puzzle book. Together with a puzzle book like ""Chess Exam and training guide"" (which is even more instructive) this is the best puzzle book for people rated in the middle of 1000. Thanks to Dan Heisman and his Internet site for recommending this book. My advice about books on tactical improvement depending on the rating:900-1100 : Chess Tactics for Student1300-1600: Winning Chess Exercises for Kids1700-2000: The Ultimate Chess Puzzle Book2000-> : John Nunn's Chess Puzzle Book."
3,Sorry to see this group disband,"I was a big Buffalo Springfield fan back in the late sixties. This album was their swan song. I hated to see them break up, but they each went on to bigger and better things. While this album is not that great compared to the first two, it has some nice tunes on it and if you want the group's entire catalog, then purchase this one. the group only put out 3 albums, so if you get this one and the first two you have the entire catalog. (I realize I am repeating myself)If I like a particular group or artist, I usually end up buying their entire catalog. The title of this one says it all about their subsequent breakup."
2,jyoss,"The book is adequate but only considering the price. The text lacks detail in a big way and the practice exams at the end of each chapter have some questions that aren't answerable from the text provided. This can be frustrating and a little scary considering the need to be fully prepared.It is not very well-written from a language point-of-view, either. If you're new to the securities business, you'll need a more comprehensive training manuel."
3,It's got some good songs,Flipmode squad always has hot beats. All of Busta's albums were hot but Rah Digga just don't compare. I wasn't totally dissapointed but I expect better from the Flipmode squad. There's about 4 hot songs that aren't radio releases. The rest is slow rhymes which doesn't work for her.
1,"Wrong, all wrong","Game is dull, overly simple and trivializes women in the worst way possible. Parents, don't let your little girls grow up thinking that this is all that women can amount to. Does anyone even notice the profession options available?!!? For real, if this game marginalized any racial group as much as it's attacked the gender issue everyone would be all over it. Just goes to show how far we've come, right?Pass on this. You'll be glad you did."
4,fun walker,"I purchased the Plan walker for my 10mos.old grandson. It took him a little while to get the hang of it but once he did he took off and now enjoys the walker very much. He also likes the blocks and they keep him interested while they are in the walker. My only concern is if one of the grandkids decides to sit in it ?? I don't know if it would take the weight of an older child. It also does not turn ,as most walkers don't , You have to be there to help him along. We have lots of fun following him around! I would recommend it to grandparents to keep at their house for a toy that does keep the kids occupied."
2,Not very helpful for learning to walk,"We borrowed this from a neighbor to help our son learn to walk but it's so tipsy that it's pretty worthless as a walker. There's no way my little guy could use this to pull himself up - when he grabs the handles from a sitting position, the thing just topples over."
2,Disappointing,"Whilte the movie seemed to have a decent plot, the action was non-existent. A lot of shots of the main character driving around in his car listening to music. There was quite a build-up to the final competition, but when it took place, it was over so quickly (and in such a boring fashion), that I had to rewind and make sure I didn't miss anything. Very disappointing experience."
5,The best album of Brazil's best female singer,"I LOVE Ms Monte's voice, it's extremely expressive and has great range. Her voice has a plaintive, almost ""little girl lost"" quality that is particularly endearing. It's the kind of voice you never tire of listening to.The only minor defects in Rose and Charcoal are first, the producers allowed some instrumentation to overwhelm Ms Monte's vocals (Segue o Seco; Ao Meu Redor), and second, the lyrics sometimes descend to the level of senselessly obscure (Maria de Verdade) and the callowly banal (Pale Blue Eyes)."
4,Great whistle with watch,"I bought the whistle watch for field hockey matches. Especially the countdown function will be very handy combined with the possibility to submit timepenalties. At the end of the penalty beeps will tell you the penalty is over, so you can't forget to let the player in again."
5,Very happy so far,"Seem to be great little units. I will admit to being only a recreational user, not an audiophile. But for the price: great install and the wife and I couldn't be happier with the results."
3,Good compilation of research papers,The authors have done good job by compiling research papers of course most of their own. But still book is in between research papers and good text book. No one can recommend this book to newbie in the field of AI. Over all its a nice book addressing application of AI techniques for mechanical engineering problems.Very rare book available of this kind. Good job.
2,Not a good preparation program,"I did not like this product. It was very particular (you accidently hit the space bar twice and you have to correct it or it counts everything after that as an error). Not only does this slow you down, but it ill-prepares you for official typing tests (i.e. at college or a career center) where you ignore your mistakes and keep going (which is how you are supposed to type; you should not edit until you are finished).Also, there were some errors in the program itself (i.e. four spaces between words) and you'd really lose a lot of time trying to figure out what you were doing wrong. A few times the program made you type a letter ""doubbble"" or more before it would register. (Mistake intentional to show what I'm describing)."
3,Worth getting,"This game is worth getting for a shot of nostalgia and for changing variety. Robotron is probably the best game in the foursome and Joust is a decent reproduction, however as mentioned in other reviews, some of the flying is off and bumping into the platforms sends you rapidly in directions you can't control. Sinistar is fun but also moves very fast. Defender, which originally attracted me to the game is much more difficult than in the arcade version. The small screen and limited ability to manuver the plane quickly to screaming humans makes the game a bit frustrating. Otherwise though, it is worth owning."
4,deliciously twisted,"Worked there, done that, got the cubicle.Hated the boss, left the company. Should have written a book.Terry Cage did write the book, and it's deliciously satisfying. Her inventive murders start small, then twist and build to Byzantine proportions. Who knew come-uppance could be so much sick, twisted fun? I wouldn't mind seeing Caine and Androtti, her detectives again, either.Bad bosses take heed. You could be next."
2,A lot smaler than I expected,I was expecting something a little bit bigger. Closer to the size of the standard GI spade. This thing is pretty small to be digging any kind of serious hole without a lot of extra effort. But all the components fit well and seem to work ok. More of a toy than a tool!
1,its a kid toy,"this is for a 5 year old,if you were stuck in sand, may be you might save your self.Thats a big may be ."
4,This was a lifesaver,"I just got home from Rome, and this map went everywhere with me. I loved it. It just covers old Rome, but as a tourist map it was perfect."
4,What a lot of Mush-rooms,"I like mushrooms of just about any variety. These dried fellows are excellent.I actually seperated the different types out to see just what I had and was amazedthat it was so many kinds, not just one or two or even three like many dried mixes.My hint to you, is to reconstitute them in a red or white wine. Then after you usethe mushrooms in your recipe pour the left over liquid into what you are cooking.I also take a couple and grate them as a coating for fish.I truly enjoy this dried mushroom mix. These get FOUR STARS from mebecause they don't beat fresh mushroom ever but, they are the best driedmushrooms I can find.Premium Wild Mushroom Mix 4 oz."
4,kinda cool,"im 9 i think its cool. but its kinda boring. because the hair gets all tangled, the cloths get stuck to the hair and they have no feet. they are not really that fun."
3,TERRORISM HAS A NEW ARENA....,"Just before the games are about to begin at the Atlanta Olympics, a deadly team of terrorists led by Kalal (Andrew Divoff) mount a precision attack on the Aquatic Center and succeed in taking the US Womens Swimming team hostage. The terrorists seal off the center and wire all the exits with powerful explosives. Unbeknownest to them, they have also missed a janitor (Linden Ashby) whom is trapped in the sprawling complex. Working against the clock, the FBI enlists the help of the mysterious Leo (Rutger Hauer), who coordinates his efforts with the trapped janitor to stop the terrorists in their tracks."
1,This game is weak,"This game is totally lame. Crash dies when hit one time. The game looks horrible when compared to games on even older systems like the N64; Mario64, Banjo Kazooie, and Zelda all look and play much better than this sorry attempt. Avoid this game, there are much better games around. I can't believe this is even a remotely popular series."
3,"Overrated. (Leonard Maltin, you surprise me!)","The information booklet in the package quotes Varda comparing her story with Citizen Kane's. It's an unjustified comparison. Contrary to her statement, what made Kane interesting was NOT how Welles told the story, but the story itself and the universal human theme it evoked. In Vagabond, Mona remains enigmatic to the end, diminishing our sympathy for her. Nor do we see others' lives really touched by her. The trifling bit of exposition of her ""motivations"", as well as her few insightful observations, seems countered by her lack of communication with others. In the end, she seems self-centered and lazy, preferring the suffering of poverty to the suffering of roots. That could have been the basis of a very good story, but that potential has not been realized."
5,Great Book,"(daughter of user)Well, I found Rebel Angels to be a slightly better book than A Great and Terrible Beauty. It added to the characters and explained them more, which was very good. Personally, I liked Simon much more than Kartik. I don't know why, but I haven't been able to like his character quite yet. Simon was a gentleman and very sweet. Maybe I just liked him because I want to be adored by a sweet gentleman the way Gemma was adored by him, I don't really know. I was a bit sad that Gemma(SPOILER ALERT) didn't pick him in the end. I understand why she couldn't though. Over all, Rebel Angels was a great book and I'll be rushing to buy the next in the series."
2,Terrible mechanics and switches,"I have used this player for a year. I love its ability to adjust tempo, the player has great playing options.What I hate is:1) the player's LCD collects pocket lint making it impossible to read.2) the player's primary selection switch is a toggle switch that has become difficult to actuate; the electrical switches have become defective.3) the LCD's window is glass. While the player was in my key pocket the window became fractured. I have no recollection of any trauma to my key pocket. I had glass shards in my pocket."
2,mp3 player and voice recorder,"large storage volume: 2 GB, mp3 player sound quality is ok, but the voice recording sound is mixing lots of noise, it is not a good voice recorder, change battery very 3 hours, it is not a good power efficient player."
4,"Brilliant for Basic Grammar, but Few if any Reading Section","This is a wonderful book for learning how nouns, verbs, participles, etc. are formed and what they look like. He goes through each very slowly and very clearly. My problem with this book is there are no readings from the greek. I realize that there is a supplemental book, which I purchased, but even there there aren't very many examples and since they are NT examples you already know what they are supposed to say before you go through all the words. I think this book is tailored more towards people who want to translate verses instead of just sitting down and reading the Greek NT. So my advise would be to buy this and buy Athenaze by Balme or download grammars such as A First Greek Course by Smith from www.textkit.com to learn to read greek fluently. (I'm talking about the 1st edition)"
5,Great for the motivated self-learner,"I went through this book on my own with no previous experience or instruction on Greek and now, only a few months later, find myself translating the New Testament with relative ease. Mounce is an incredible teacher; I would reccomend this grammer to anyone without hesitation."
5,best available intro grammar,"here it is folks, the best available introductory grammar for the nt. for those who don't know, greek is an inflected language with similarities to latin and sanskrit; that means lots and lots of endings and exceptions to memorize. the system mounce offers is optimal, facilitating learning of the mechanics of the language (if one understands how letters change when endings are added, then the apparent exceptions are not really exceptions). this text treats all major verb forms that one will need to know. it does not deal extensively with less common forms such as the future participle or pluperfect tense and an intermediate level grammar (d wallace's ""beyond the basics"" is good)will be necessary as well for serious students. incidentally, it is written from an evangelical perspective and offers some introductory applications for exegesis."
4,Preparing for Graduate Reading Exam in Greek,"The CD-Rom software with this version of Mounce's book is worth it for practicing the vocabulary and getting pronunciations. I think you can get this from his website now. GreekFlash Pro has a bigger vocabulary with pronunciation. I needed to learn Greek for to pass a graduate reading exam. Personally, I would recommend not buying this book, but instead get Black's ""Learn to Read NT Greek"" for beginning work, and add Wallace's ""The Basics of NT Syntax"" for intermediate work. Also worth using is Trenchard's ""Complete Vocabulary Guide to the Greek New Testament"" which offers cognate word study and a comprehensive listing of all the high-frequency-words found in the Greek NT. Years ago, I used Paine's ""Basic Greek"" and while this older text has some fine passages for translating (both biblical and ancient Greek), I found this book awful to try to learn from as a first-year student. Good Luck!"
1,The absolute beginner,"This book can be good for 12 to 14 year old children. What this book explains in 166 pages can be explained in 2, if you have some brains. This book makes incredibily stupid comparisons to explain simple matters. Chosing a Reference Tone is explained by moving a stool from one room to another, dhah! The 18% gray card is compared with the way FedEx used to work. The author even starts with explaining what percentages are. Photografy is and will always be a quit technical thing. It's very nice of the author to try and make Photografy accessible for everyone. If you've had any proper education or technical background, please don't read this book, it's a big waste of money and there's tons of information on the net, that will teach you much more then this poor book, and it's for free."
3,Good but pricey,"This book helps you understand how to expose a photo correctly. It goes into how to use your on-camera metering (as is suspected) and it also helps you visualize contrast and film's capacity to record that contrast. However, I wouldn't suggest buying this book unless you really have no idea what contrast really means. This the book is really too expensive and the minimal information given is not worth the price. I also believe that the author tried too hard to help you visualize contrast. In the end, this book seems more like a workbook for third graders, with pictures of a train representing the different tones found in your subject. Personally, I would have been fine without this analogy and if he didn't waste the time or the pages.My conclusion, therefore, is that this book gives you information that can be very difficult to find in other photography resources. However, if you plan on buying this book, expect to pay more than you would think suitable."
4,Learning the art of correct exposure,"If you are new to photograpy or simply want a refresher on the concept of obtaining correct exposure and the importance of using a spot meter, this is a great book. It can be a little repetative, but this is probably necessary for someone who is unfamilar with these concepts. Overall, I found this to be very informative and well written with helpful illustrations."
3,"Comfortable, but a bit small, with minor problems","The wrist pad is comfortable. The usable mouse area is a bit on the small side, with less than an inch of usable up down movement area for my mouse. The top of my pad curves up a bit instead of lying flat. Cat hair gets embedded in the cloth fabric, and I can't get it to come out. As a fairly inexpensive mouse pad, it is worthy of consideration, but there are hopefully better pads than this out there if you are picky."
4,Very Comfortable,"Very comfortable mouse pad and really inexpensive. Wish there were more choices for colors, blue isn't my first choice, but I still love it. Definitely worth it."
1,Lasted 3 weeks,What a drag. This mouse pad isn't even a month old and the fabric cover is pulling up at the edge.
4,Zombies and ghosts,"Very interesting book. All my kids (6, 4 and 3) love it for the ghosts and monsters, although I think the book is a bit too difficult and long for the 2 younger ones to follow. All the same, they like to hear about Monsters - again and again. Yet, at the end of every reading they will ask ""so are there monsters?"" and ""did you also make a mistake about monsters, mummy?""."
1,Way too hard,"I'm not a master at fighting games, but I got to wiggle my way through the medium difficulty level of MK1 on SNES, and I finish the medium level of Super Street Fighter II revival. But MK advance is way too hard, even on the easiest level. It's not challenging, it's downright frustrating."
1,Are these reviewers paid by Midway???,"[...].Don't believe the hype. I know the GameBoy Advance has it's limits, but in this case it's quantity over quality. Hard to control, sound effects are iffy, graphics are hard to see...shall I continue? Street Fighter Turbo is a good translation to GBA...MK Advance is a bad translation. Save your money people!!!"
2,I guess it is Okay.,This game is good but it needs more things in it. This game first of all needs a practice mode because when I just go on to the real game I am not that good because there is only a few buttons on that tiny system. They need to make this game a little easier because it is impossible to beet the 1st stage even when it is on easiest. When it is on easiest it is no fair because he won't even give you a freaken chance to at least hit him (cheater). Every time I am trying to do a special and I thick you know I can't because he won't give me the chance to. I've tried like a million times and all the people to try to beet the 1st stage. This game is fun when you finally get a chance to hit him and if you hit him a little you just [angered] him... I got this game a long and still not past the 1st stage... All the other Mortal Kombat games is better and I can't wait till Deadly Allience comes out this Fall.
3,Mortal Kombat Advance- My review,"I have heard a lot of people complain that this game is too hard.I must point out however that there is a handicap feature which is in the ""options"" menu that makes the game much more playable. It's poorly explained in the manual; What you have to do to is hit the D pad up and watch the bar move until its a point that you think its ok.Now having said that...I do think the game does deserve a second look. It had very good graphics and sound. Some of the more complicated moves are tough to administer though. It also takes some patience to learn some of the special abilities for each of the players (like Sub Zero for example).I recommend this game but be aware this is not a game you can simply jump right in and play. Its does take some time to figure it out.Hope this review helps.."
2,"I love Mortal Kombat, BUT...","I know a lot of people like myself enjoy the MK games. However, this game just doesn't live up to expectations. The control is absolutely horrendous. It's a challenge just to pull off basic moves like a sweep or jump kick. There are a lot of bugs in the game- for example listen as Sub-Zero jumps, he sounds like Kitana. A lot of the sounds don't even work half the time, and I've even had opponents in the corner and it won't register hits. They have obviously rushed this game out the door for Xmas, without finishing it. What a disapointment with Street Fighter for the GBA being great. Overall, check this one out only if you are a big MK fan."
1,Controls are terrible!,"I was looking forward to a complete packing of MK for GBA, but the controls and gameplay was horrible. Very hard to execute moves and it was way too easy for the CPU opponent to sweep you into oblivion. I ended up trading this one back.If you want portable Kombat for Game Boy Advance, go for MKII and MKIII instead.(looking foward to MK Deadly Alliance)"
3,"not exactly what I expected 7.5, 10, 12.5 lbs","If you're expecting to get shiny, mirror finish dumbbells, these are not them. They are textured and not as shiny as expected, looking somewhat mass produced. Made in China. Not that I'm against products made in China -- all my Apple products have parts made in China and I'm happy with them. Given the high price, I expected smoother, shinier finish."
2,Dead weight,This was a bad call on my part did'nt think this one through the water gets stale crickets get through the small mess screen its just decor for the tank now.
4,Very Good!,My 15 year old daughter who is not a reader has buzzed right through these. I read the first one. Not very deep but not terribly offensive either.
2,A good concept but it's written by a desperate person,"While reading the A-list I noticed that Zoey Dean used the name Poppy more than once. What is so coincidental is that that's the same name as the publishing company. Sounds like somebody was desperate to be published by Poppy and nobody else.The book was kinda boring, and I thought they should have made the A-list girls more diva and mean. Plus I doubt people actually live like that. If you want a real good story about rich teens try Gossip Girl, the Clique series, or The Pretty Little Liars series. I just wasn't impressed by that book, as I am usually not impressed with Zoey Dean's other books. Like her book Zoey Dean's Talent, I just wish that Zoey Dean had talent."
5,Downey Jr's Unsung Work,"This one really flew under the radar. I believe it won the acadamy award for costume design. But there's much more to Restoration. An understated Meg Ryan and vulnerable Downey Jr. Sam Neil is fantastic as the king. After watching the movie, I immediately ordered the soundtrack. Sit back and watch Downey Jr's transformation during restoration."
4,Beautiful period piece!,"You probably will not find many more beautifully photographed historical films than ""Restoration"". Robert Downey's acting is very good, although I am not a fan of Meg Ryan...she always seems so ""self aware"" in her roles.The film has an inspiring message as it stresses the virtues of human kindness and self sacrifice over a life of self seeking indulgence. And the film is an excellent depiction of the times...from the restoration of the monarchy to the plague years to the great fire of London. Well worthwhile seeing!"
1,never recieved,"i bought this item as a gift, and didn't realize it never came until i went to visit the recipient. they moved away in the middle of june, but the invoice claims this item should have arrived well before they moved. i can't seem to find a way to email you, the seller because amazon just takes me through loops. there was another order from someone else that wasn't received as well, so i'm not sure if it was the mail carriers mishap or what. but if there is any way you can help me that would be wonderful."
4,Phil Collins...WOW!,"How many years have passed since this record was released?...and i still get chills everytime i come back to it. ""Sussudio,"" ""Don't Lose my Number,"" ""Take Me Home,"" i still don't know what these songs are about, but it still hits me. This album accomplishes almost as much as Genesis' Invisible Touch."
1,Pop,Phil Collins might have made some infectious music on this album but it lacks real magic. This is pure pop and thats rarely a good thing. It certainly is not here.
1,Sorry but crap on a stick,"Many of the movies I get from here are what I want, this one fit the Bill and I am happy."
5,THE BEST!,"I just got this game and it RULES! I had some doubts about whether or not I should get it after reading some of the reviews. The game has stunning graphics. The best example is the way the water reflects things. There are many missions and yes, you do get to fight Darth Maul. You have many different moves such as jumping, throwing, pushing, and pulling. The lightsaber is your main weapon, although you can also use rifles and various grenades. The multiplayer option is great. There are a lot of people you can be, ranging from Qui-Gon to Mace Windu. The levels are beautiful and very large. This is a great XBox game even if you are not a Star-Wars fan."
4,"Good, but just wait . . .","If you're a Star Wars fan and new to the xbox this is a great place to start. The graphics are alright -- there are definitely a lot of other games out there doing a better job of utilizing the graphics capabilities of the xbox, but Obi-Wan is by no means ugly.A new use of the xbox controls gives you more flexibility in your lightsaber wielding while added force powers give you many options for dispensing of foes.The entire game is lengthy enough that you won't beat it in a weekend but no so difficult that you'll want to throw the thing across the room.However, if you're really in the mood to do some galactic justice with a lightsaber, just hang on till November 2002 when Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast comes out. It promises much, much better graphics and all the things you'll love about Obi-Wan will only get better in Outcast (other than the fact that you won't be playing as Obi-Wan)."
3,Falling short of my expectations,"I bought OBI-WAN the day it came out expecting something out of this world...no pun intended. The graphics are mediocre at best. The PS1 and N64 could run similar graphics without all the rich detail in the background. The sound, however, is another story. I have the system hooked up to a 5.1 Yamaha Digital Dolby receiver and the sound is incredible. The sound actually travels fully around you. Whether it's Qui-Gon speaking to you or a battle droid firing, you can tell from what direction it's coming from. The gameplay was simple enough and easy to learn. Both my nine year old son and I were able to finish the entire game in just about 20 hours of playing, leaving only the finished levels to do over or battle eachother one-on-one in the Jedi arenas, which is fun at first but gets real boring real fast. I definitely recommend you rent this one before buying...I wish I had."
4,"Fun to play, but not a keeper!","I rated this a four, because it asked how much fun is this game. It is a fun game, but it is nothing like Halo. Using the force is an interesting twist, and once you get the controls down it helps out a lot. However, it would probably be a great game to rent, if you had a few nights to play all the way through. The graphics are lacking, and it hangs when lots of characters enter the screen for a fight (for a second or two), and I don't think that should happen on the Xbox. So, definitely worth a rental, but once you beat it you won't be itching to have another crack at it."
1,"It is so awful, that it even puts the Xbox to shame","Repetitive gameplay, horrible framerate, out-dated engine, ugly graphics, frequent pauses, it is the worst game to hit the Xbox. It is just terrible!"
2,Very upset,"I bought this game because of the Star Wars name like im sure most people did. What a let down...One can tell this game was pushed through production too quickly. As pointed out earlier the frame rates are dispicable, the action mediocre at best, and gameplay less then fun. This game could have been great if they spent some more time on it (but they didn't..."
4,Star Wars Obi-Wan X Box,"Another impressive X Box release, STAR WARS OBI-WAN is one of the most awesome games out there! With great graphics, clear sound, excellent controls and exciting action, this is fantastic fun for Star Wars fans!Obi-Wan centres around the adventures of young Obi-Wan Kenobi across five levels as he battles the evil Trade Federation, the Black Heth crime organization, and other assorted villians. As you battle your way through all the levels, you can use force powers, including force pushing your enemies and doing some stylish lightsaber moves! What the game lacks in surrounding detail it makes up for in action. The story is exciting, if unoriginal, but the plot does provide some lightsaber duels! I play this all the time and I never get tired of it. Buy this game!GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 9/10FUN FACTOR: 10/10"
3,Good research over a wide variety of arms,"I purchased the book hoping to find more detail on the Steyr Solothurn S1-100 MP34 (o). Unfortunately, given the large number of arms covered it is limited in detail as to each one. While much more indepth than most that mearly try and cover each weapon it does give a richer history and background into their development. A unique blend of history of German arms and details of specific weapons. Someone looking for a reference book on a specific weapon should look elsewhere but the collector that wants a broader understanding of the background and details of producing weapons for Germany prior to and during WW II this is a revealing work. Illustrations are good."
2,Buttons wore out after two years,"I really liked my Harmony remote, until about 1-1/2 to 2 years after I bought it, when the buttons started wearing out and not working. It starts out as the buttons not being as responsive and having to push harder on them to get them to work, especially buttons you use a lot, such as Volume. However, even on buttons not used a lot, some have worn out and don't work well anymore. For a product this expensive, I think the buttons should last longer."
1,Worst purchase I ever made.,"Wasted two days working with this remote. It often forgot the few components that it learned. It had no clue how to work my plasma tv. It turned on the home theater sound about one in four times. I wasted hours with customer support. I would suggest finding out if your components are already known by logitech. If the remote needs to learn anything it can have problems. The biggest problem I had with it was powering up the tv or changing inputs. Customer support couldn't get these settings to work either. Some have left good reviews, all I can say is make sure your items are in the logitech data base."
3,"Convienent, But not built to last","This product is admittedly not the easiest to setup. I have a receiver, dvr, dvd, and TV to control. Setup took me about thirty minutes. Then I realized I had control over where the buttons are displayed and I spent about another 3 hours trying to get all the commands I needed to display on the appropriate pages.After it was all setup it's a breeze to use. The help button is great for when a command doesn't fire but I found that turning the system off and back on usually fixes the problem 9 out of 10 times and is 100 times faster. Now even my parents can use the TV when they come over to babysit.Negatives... The most used buttons give out after a while (the DVR's skip ahead and replay in my case. In my setup these are located next to the display on the remote.) Plan on buying on of these once a year if you watch TV nightly. (and enjoy setting it up again.)"
1,Remote is impossible to set up on a Mac,"Bought this remote, read all of the great reviews and now I can't believe what a nightmare the thing is.Been at it for over four hours and still haven't been able to get the remote to communicate with the computer software. I'm not even to step 2. My dad bought the same remote and has had the same issues on a pc.This thing is awful."
2,Doesn't do what I want,"The good things about this remote are:- Its shape and feel are nice- Programming via USB/Internet are very nice.However, it is not COMPLETELY programmable. You can only program the specific buttons ""watch tv"" or ""watch a movie"", and thus I never get the combination of buttons I want. For instance, the ""POWER"" button at the top of the remote cannot be programmed, nor the ""HELP"" button. In addition, it's far too difficult to navigate back and forth between device types. I can't even figure out how to change the volume of the TV when I'm watching a DVD.While not as attractive, the Sony AV3100 works far better than this remote. I just wish the Sony AV3100 looked like the H-659.Bottom line:- Average users shouldn't buy this remote because it is too difficult to navigate between device types.- Advanced users shouldn't buy this remote because they cannot have complete control over every button.Not recommended. Try the AV3100."
4,"Good remote, but will wear out","I had this remote for a couple of years and recently replaced it with the newer model 670. I actually preferred this model due to a better button layout (see my review of the model 670). This model is also cheaper. However, be aware, as others have pointed out, that they do wear out. After 2-3 years buttons will stop working. That's what happened to mine. So consider this a product with a 2-3 year lifetime, and expect to need to replace it at that time."
3,OK,This remote looks and feels great. I love that you can program all your different devices and have multiple functions occur by pressing 1 button. It did take a little bit of work to program so don't buy it if you are technically challenged. It doesn't work flawlessly. After you press a button that controls multiple devices you have to remember to keep the remote pointed at those devices for several seconds while it sends the signal to each device one at a time. The help button is a very nice feature. I just wish i didn't have to use it so much. I usually need it because the remote didn't change the TV input. The remote is great in theory but like I said it doesn't alway do what you want it to do. My wife won't even use if for this reason. Disappointing since it was kinda pricey.
3,Okay book,"My 16 month old enjoys this book somewhat, but it's not one that she wants to look at over and over. I personally don't find it very interesting. I prefer other Katz books."
4,Solid Debut Album,"I just recently decided to get into Otis Redding, so I started from the 1st album and this particular copy of the album is wonderful. Otis has a unique, passionate voice, esp during downtempo love songs...his voice reaches out and grabs your soul out of your chest. Worth the purchase!"
5,"Built well, fit well","We've only had minimal play time with these to date, but so far they seem to fit well and be well built for general play."
2,Too small,"I bought these and another set (ALI), and have found that these are really slim inside. There is lots of padding and not really enough space for your hand to fit comfortably or really to bend your fingers. Would not recommend for anyone over 6yrs old."
3,Good for little heavy bag punching hands.,"My boys (7 and 8) have these for swinging at the heavy bag. They seem pretty sturdy, but I am worried that they will wear a bit from getting pulled on with teeth... Time will tell, we have only had them since X-mas.Also, the quality is good, but not great, and I saw a $5 pair at ""Five Below"" the other day and kicked myself a little for getting these."
5,it was a great movie,"i haven't read this book ,but i hope to do so . the movie was the best psychological thriller i've ever seen. anyone who wants to see a well thought out movie this is it. i recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stimulating psychological piece.the character development was excellent , same with the plot,conflict, and suspense/foreshadowing. this was definitely one of stephen king's finest pieces."
5,Sucker,"Well I saw these guys as the back up band for the Offspring in the Conspiracy Of One tour, and this was the last song they played and it totally blew me away. I defenitly recommend that you buy this single because I think that 28 Days deserve a bit of money to make their band go into future concerts and be a big band.Signing Off Now,Brad Cummins"
2,Great movie - terrible DVD,"There are plenty of reviews on the movie itself available here and elsewhere, so I don't feel the need to add much more. It's a terrific movie - 'nuff said. This DVD itself, though, is the worst I've ever seen. The film quality is poor throughout - very grainy. There are also lots of dropped frames, particularly in the first 30 minutes or so. Spend your money on a better version of this excellent movie - you'll be glad you did."
3,Great allegory about slavery,"I saw this movie on a premium cable channel several years ago and decided I needed to own a copy. Black aliens escape to Earth, fleeing slavery on some distant planet. They are able to blend in and find a better existence in New York City. When white alien ""slave catchers"" attempt to retrieve one particular fugitive slave, other fugitives eventually come together to defeat them. This was the first movie appearance for actor Joe Morton (as The Brother), and there are other familiar faces in the movie as well. Serio-comic and thought provoking. It also addresses drugs and blight in NYC."
3,the movie is a lot different from the book,"if you want the real experience...read the novel by james clavell. this movie is nothing like the novel...from reading other customers comments, it sounds like they just saw the movie and didnt read it. everything they are writing about is off-balance. read the book and dont make yourself an ***."
1,EEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHAT AN UGLY YASMIN.I AM A HUGE BRATZ FAN,BUT I CAN UNDERSTAD WHAT HAPPEND TO THE MIDNIGHT DANCE COLLECTION.ALL OF THEM ARE UGLY.TO GET A BEAUTIFUL YASMIN DOLL.GET THE BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ DOLL INSTED OR ANOTHER YASMIN DOLL.PRETTY IN PUNK IS LAME TOO."
1,this is evil.,"I know goth when I see it and this doll is goth. I just hope this is not going to make good girls into bad evil girls by dressing like bratz. and your right barbie is always going to be 1st. I think barbie is a better role model then bratz really I do so I hope you girls out in the world london,china,japan,USA,mexico EVERY GIRL IN THE WORLD DO NOT LOOK UP BRATZ AS ROLE MODELS. thank you.jessica."
5,stupendous,I wanted to get a better idea of life processes as related to biochemistry. I found this textbook very helpful in strengthening my understanding of the subject.The textbook is well organized and not too complicated. I have chemistry background and was able to learn what I hadn't in the past.Thank you.
1,BLEH !!!,"Highly overrated. I would expetct better from such talented artists, especially since Led Zeppelin and Bad Company are two of my favorite groups."
5,The 5 star rating says it all !!!,I have been listening to this effort from The Firm since it's release in the mid-eighties and I have to admit it still sounds as good as it did then. This is one of my all time favorites.
4,Very Solid Effort. Keep and open mind and you'll really dig this disc.,"There are some excellent songs on this cd. Jimmy Page does some fine playing, Paul Rogers' vocice is in top form, very solid drumming and killer fretless bass playing. There are a few average songs like Make Or Break, and there some good songs like Closer, Someone To Love, and there are some excellent songs including Midnight Moonlight, Radioactive and Satisfaction Guaranteed.They set out to form a different identity which is a massive undertaking considering they were key players in two of the biggest and best bands of all time. It's just a different flavor than zep and bc, but it's real good. Their 2nd cd Mean Business is not as good as this but there are a few great songs that may make it worth it - Live In Peace and All The King's Horses."
4,Great Names on a great album,"Singer Paul Rodgers (ex-Free and ex-Bad Company), guitarist Jimmy Page (ex-Led Zeppelin and ex-Yardbirds), bassist Tony Franklin and drummer Chris Slade (ex-Manfred Man?) came together for two albums. Great old fashioned Rock'n'Roll."
3,It's more of a GUIDE....(think pre-purchase guide),I was expecting more in the way of technical explanations about my MB. This is not the book you want if you are looking for a breakdown of how things are put together(as in DIY auto repairs).It is a very good guide on what to look for mostly when purchasing a MB auto.
5,Mercedes E-Class owners bible,Excellent book. Goes farther than most. It is not the manufacturers shop manual. Some details you only get from that book. Still much better than most so-called complete manuals.
1,Truly bastardized,"The sets were good and the actors did the best they could, but Dickens' story was truly bastardized -- along with most of the cast! It started to get comical -- who would be revealed next as a bastard?And blaming poor Mrs. Crisparkle for Jasper's addiction was unfair to a delightful character.And not only did they provide a very mingy ring to represent Edwin's mother's ring, they changed the story and he gave it to Rosa!I could go on and on, but this production was really a mess."
4,Harmony Remote,So far so good. I haven't had any issues with battery life quite yet. Everything works as expected.
1,Poor button layout and feel,"Pros:Web based setupCustomizableCons:Poor keypad designPoor keypad tactileReliabilty (lack of)Battery lifeReview:Was very easy to setup online (except for a test drive issue which was annoying). Also had an issue with ""Replace Battery"" on the display, and the unit was inoperable until I pulled and replace the supplied batteries five times. Not sure what was going on here. Operated fine after that.But...I can't honestly believe anyone at Logitech spent any time actually using this remote and thought the keypad layout and design were worthy of a $100 plus remote. I would rather use all my existing remotes than have to suffer with using the H688Bottom line: Sent it back after two days."
4,Handy universal remote,Good remote easy to program. Only problem I have is that the buttons are a little small and the writing on them is smaller.
3,Look and fit great but do not last long.,"Got these Levis for my grandson for his 7th birthday on March 16th. They fit well and he loved them. Unfortunately by April he already had holes in the knees of these jeans. I will say that he is an active boy and rough on pants. You will have to be your own judge. I would say that if you want them for school or for looking good these are great but to play in, just stick to cheaper pants."
5,Excellent!,"My 13 year old is tall and athletic so most jeans will just fall of his hips or are too short...Not these, they are perfect for him. Since you can't find them in the stores, Amazon is the way.He started out in 12 slim and progressed to 20 slims!If your kid is tall and slim, and doesn't like baggy, these are the jeans!"
1,NOT WEATHERPROOF! - this is an indoor camera,"Read description. Waited for it to be delivered... clearly stated on the product (same p/n) ""Indoor camerea"""
4,Great Product for the Price.,"This is a great product for the price you are paying. You need to be sure to purchase an extension for the camera because the cord it does bring is very short. It works pretty well during the day, although at times if the sun is towards it the image appears off color. It does not work well for night time. The image on the screen is completely black, and any car head lights appear distorted."
1,Namco Museum,"I ordered this item January 21, 2003, my account was debited for the payment and as of February 5, 2003 I have not received the product so at this time I am not very happy about having my money taken and nothing to show for it!"
2,Glitchy,"I was not expecting anything fancy, but this phone has been very glitchy. I would have expected better from Motorola. After the first week, the phone stopped being able to read or write to SD memory.Also the mic in the phone barley works. I need to use an earbud mic for people to be able to understand me.Other glitches too.It looked factory new when i got it, but I suspect this phone might have failed factory Quality Control."
5,A perfect introduction to the evils of corporate america,"This book should be valued reading to anyone who is concerned with the future of the working poor, the environment, or your own freedoms. Danaher puts together great writings from some of the most respected names in the subject. This book is simple enough for your 14 year old and interesting enough to cause any rational thinking and compassionate adult to stand up and do something about the oppression and destruction caused by big business."
4,I liked this book a lot,It revealed how some sectors of society are well off. I realize that business ruin themselves from the top down.
5,A lifetime of non stick,"If your tired of having your nonstick wear out and be scratched off with with metal utensils, this is the solution. Sitram, which is one of the bigest and best commercial cookware manufactuers in Europe, has developed a nonstick which is part of the metal. Its not just a coating which can be scrubbed off. I find this pan to be as nonstick as any I've ever used and beautiful to look at as well.The interior has an unique silver look to it which contibutes to its appeal. As with all pans the best way to insure that nothing sticks is to preheat the pan and oil before adding the cooking item. This pan really has it all, looks, durability, nonstick, and a aluminum bottom which makes it a great conductor of heat."
2,No Tend Skin!,"Although it does not have the smell of Tend Skin (my wife says I smell like a tossed salad with Italian dressing), it is not as effective. For razor bumps and ingrown hairs, I have found that Tend Skin works much better."
5,Dennis IS Ever de YOUNG!,"Styx has long been my favorite band, with an unprecedented (or subsequently matched) 5 consecutive multi-platinum albums!But this album (as well as his double disc compilation of old Styx hit all with new arrangements and an orchestra) reminds one that HE IS the genius driving force of Styx with his song writing AND vocal prowess. Great new tunes!Also reccomended: Music of Styx: Live with Symphony Orchestra by Dennis de YoungPapagambit"
4,Almost a great Syx album,"Listening to this, I hear a lot of the classic-Styx formula, but something is missing: JY and Tommy Shaw. If you take the best tracks from this disc and the best tracks from Cyclorama, you would have an album that rivaled any of their multi-platinum releases."
1,A very poor security book on WIndows NT/2000,"I bought this book with particular interest on extra security ideas for Windows 2000. The title would lead you ,to the incorrect, conclusion that there is some coverage of windows 2000.The book deals with the ISO stack, and beginners TCP/IP, Cisco router access lists, firewalls, and scanners, everything but Windows 2000.Then we have the Windows chapter, which is exclusively based on NT 4.0, with the odd minor mention of Win2k. This book was published in 2001, and the author comments that the latest version of IIS is version 4.0.The title of this book is incorrect, and if I could get my money back, through mis-representation, I would.The chapters on access lists and TCP/IP are fine for beginners, but then why not call the book, Network security for beginners.Unless you are very new to network security, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for security information on Windows 2000."
4,Great case (almost),"This is a nice case, solidly built with plenty of space for drives and good cooling. It has plastic clips to secure the drives in all bays so you can dispense with looking for screws, and clips to replace the screws for add on cards. These actually work very well, unlike those in some cases I've seen. The only drawback was the ""RAIDMAX"" power supply. I had a better supply and swapped it with another smaller machine. The power supply is fine for a small system, but it doesn't work well with this case. There is only one SATA supply plug that doesn't reach as far as the four internal drive bays. I run a loaded system with 3 SATA drives and, 2 DVDs, a floppy drive and a flash reader/extra USB ports in the other floppy slot.Overall, this is a great case for the price. For those who care, it looks sharp with blue LEDs shining in the front and on the clear side panel with fan. For me, it is a clean, well-built, easy to work with case with good cooling and plenty of space."
1,Who thought of this?,"My 4 year old received this as a Christmas gift. This toy definitely needs parental supervision. The kitty litter stains carpet, so unless you've got a carpet cleaning system on hand, play with this toy in the kitchen. Do not recommend to purchase for a child unless you are going to be with them every second it's going to be used."
2,"Fun for Kids, Pain for Mom","Maybe I shouldn't write a review so quickly, but my 5 year old daughter has only had this toy for 3 hours and I hate it already. She seems to like it, but I agree with the reviewer that says it requires constant adult supervision. The sand is VERY fine and gets everywhere! I've vacuumed twice tonight and finally took away the bottle and sand and told her she had to play with just the dolls. Maybe an older child would get more out of it. I disagree that it would teach a child responsibility for cleaning up after a real cat. You can't control when a real cat pees, and real cat pee has a smell. Perhaps if the sand was stinky, then it would be the MOST obnoxious toy on the market right now.The doll is nice though. I like that she's not as ""busty"" as Barbie, and so is easier to dress."
4,ALMOST AS GOOD AS BLUE BELLE,"VACHSS IS EXCELLENCE - SOME OF HIS BOOKS ARE MORE DISTURBING THAN OTHERS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. BURKE IS A CHARACTER OF A LIFETIME. WITH BURKE , VACHSS HAS ENSURED HIS PLACE IN CONTEMPORARY MYSTERY WRITING AND CAN REST ASSURED THAT HE WILL KEEP MAKING MONEY FOR HIS TRUE PASSION IN LIFE, HELPING CHILDREN."
4,Basic and Useful,"Very useful in formulating educational strategies for your bright child, with one exception. A good portion of the book discusses identification of the gifted child. Most of the rest of it is organized around choosing the best public or private schooling for your child. What are your options? Which ones work best? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each method? It does not address how to help your gifted child if you have chosen to homeschool, which is what many parents of bright children want to know."
2,"Superficial, go elsewhere","This book spends the first several chapters explaining how to determine if a child is gifted, and reassuring people it's okay if their child isn't. If I needed another book like that, I wouldn't have spent money on this one! This book seemed to promise ways to help a gifted child soar, and instead spends too much time (and too many pages) defining what a gifted child is, how they're identified, and what they're like. That's what I thought the starting point would be."
4,"Don't listen to the reviews, these bottles are great","After buying nearly every bottle on the market, I finally tried these bottles. I was nervious about them because of all the reviews, but these are the only bottles that worked for my son. The problem we were having with every other bottles was that even with the slowest flow nipple it was too fast for him. With therse bottles he can control the rate of flow and doesn't end up gaggin on the formula. It did take a while for him to finish the bottle at first but now (at 2 months) he can finish 6 ounces in 15 minutes and he isn't covered in formula. The ONLY drawback is the cleaning of all the pieces. Overall, a great bottle."
2,DId not like!,"I did not like these bottles at all. You cannot use a sterilizer or a bottle warmer with them. (Of course, it doesn't say that on the outside of the package--you have to buy them and open them to find that out!) When I would warm them in a glass of water, it was impossible to get them completely dry at the bottom, and the water would leak all over the baby. They were hard to clean. The nipples were also awful. My son would suck like crazy and get very little liquid out of them. We switched to the Evenflo Comfi bottles, which were much cheaper to buy and a whole lot easier to use. My son does not have a lot of gas with them."
1,Wish we could return it!,"I really wanted to like this bottle. The shape is great and seemed like it would make feeding easier... we are about to take a long road trip and wanted an angled bottle that would make it easier to feed our son in his car seat if we didn't have a safe place to pull over. We have, unfortunately, been very disappointed. The Stage 1 nipple is too slow for our 14-week-old. The Stage 2 nipple is way too fast. The nipple collapses easily and the bottle leaks frequently. Also, the size, shape, and flow of the nipple would make it very difficult to switch between breastfeeding and bottle. We primarily breastfeed but pump-and-bottle-feed regularly; in doing so, we've tried an assortment of bottles--- just about everything but Dr. Brown's--- and our little one has done great with all of them. This is the ONLY bottle which he absolutely hates!"
4,wonderful bottles!,"The only reason I gave these bottles 4 stars is because I had to enlarge the hole in the nipple with a knife on all of them. I also don't like not being able to put them in a bottle warmer. I haven't had any problem, though, with the nipple colapsing or anything leaking. My son has had very little gas problems and I love the angle of the bottles. I would recommend these to anyone."
1,too much trouble,"Don't waste your time or money on these bottles. I hated these bottles. You must buy the Ventaire nipples only, which my daughter did not like. (We used the Nuk Nipples, They are wonderful!) and the bottom was just more trouble that it was worth. Where your baby is scream because she is hungry the good old plain Gerber bottles are still the best. There is no assembly work needed. Just pour and serve!"
1,Baby Wouldn't Take,"My newborn wouldn't take this bottle. I was pumping and trying to feed out of the bottle so I could go out, and he just wouldn't take it. The nipple is a terrible design, nothing like my nipple. It is very hard and a unatural design. I bought the medela brand instead, which he took right away. I would not recommend this bottle to anyone."
2,a little too much work,"These bottles were a gift to me at my baby shower, and sounded great at the beginning. With a newborn, the 6 different parts are a pain. My son couldn't get anything out of the stage 1, from the first day home we have used stage two. Now that he is five months old, they leak horrible. I don't suggest these bottles, start your baby on a different bottle so you don't have to try and figure these out down the road"
2,Frustrating feedings,"We thought these bottles would make our 4 week old son have less gas. They are attractive and very easy to clean. However, they have been the most irritating bottles I've ever used! The stage 1 nipples come with virtually no hole so you have to poke larger holes in them. Not only that but the nipples collapse. I would have to unscrew the top in the middle of the feeding to release the suction so my son could get some formula out. He seemed to work so hard at trying to eat that he would get tired and fall asleep making it hard to burp him and resulting in him not eating enough. He would then want to eat more a short time later. I eventually threw all of the stage one nipples out and packed the bottles away. Hopefully they will work better when the baby is a little older. If you want a good bottle, buy the Dr. Brown's."
4,The only nipple shape my daughter would take,"Despite the multiple parts, this bottle and the Dr. Brown's Bottles were the only nipples my daughter could comfortably take! The bottles are attractive, they are true to their promise in decreasing the amount of gas that gets into baby's tummy, and we've had nothing but good experiences with this product for the past year!"
2,Ventaire Bottles,"Attempted to feed my three month old daughter with these bottles, it was a very disappointing outcome. It is simply not compatible with my bottle warmer, and my daughter was sucking so hard to get her milk, I thought she was going to starve. The only purpose it served was to make it a more comfortable hold for feeding, and that was about it. Maybe I will try to use these bottle when my daughter is older and wants to have juice or water."
2,slow flow,"I received these as a gift and they do keep the gas to a minimum except the nipples keep the milk from flowing at a reasonable rate-- it's either too slow(which takes 45 minutes for my baby to finish or he doesn't finish a bottle at all or they flow so fast that my baby chokes). He now knows when he's being fed with those nipples and cries unless I change the nipple. Luckily, regular nipples work on these bottles."
1,Terrible,"I used these bottles for 4 days. They were the worst 4 days I have ever had. It took my daughter 45 min. to eat 1 or 2 ounces. She fussed the whole 4 days. Nothing barely came out of the nipple. I tried the stage 2 nipple thinking she could get more. Well, she did get more but most ended up on her than in her mouth. I had bought so many of these bottles and had to buy new. My husband and I decided to try nursers. Our daughter has been so much happier. She has not fussed since we switched her over."
3,Good and Bad,"I recieved these bottles as a gift and really liked the look of the bottles! Looked like easy cleaning, easy cleaning yes but too many pieces to wash!! When you go to put the bottles together you have to properly put the disk in or you will wear the formula! They leak! They do seem to do well with the bubbles and my baby doesnt spit up awhole lot. Now about those nipples stage 1 goes way tooo slow and I was feeding for over an hour with only 4 ounces! Stage 2 nipples do go alittle too fast but better than my baby trying to suck on the stage 1 nipple forever!So you have to take the good with the bad with these bottles!"
1,dont waste your money.. heres why....,"your having a new baby chances are, so why make more work for yourself than you need to? these bottles are junk! i thought they would work well because they have the vent in the bottle.. NO WAY.. they leaked everywhere.. some would, some wouldnt.. then the little plastic piece in the bottle, you have to put it in the bottle right or the bottle will leak. it got all over my son. after the third time trying to feed him with the bottle, i brought them all back and got the avent bottles. those are wonderful, no leaking, just put the nipple on and feed... im glad i brough them back. theres too much cleaning with these bottles, too many parts.. these bottles are almost sure to bug the heck out of you, if not.. lucky you!"
2,Not as great as they seem,"I bought these Vent Aire bottles because my son has reflux, and I was led to believe that they would not swallow as much air with them. He got the same amount of air with these bottles as regular bottles (I've tried both). We recently switched to Playtex Nursers, and even though they're more expensive (the liners will KILL ya), they work WAY better if you have a child with stomach issues. In my opinion, they're a good bottle, but not worth the money. Buy regular bottles. They work the same."
2,a pain to warm,"These bottles would have been great, but you can't use a regular bottle warmer because of the vents on the bottom. And you can't microwave them, so you have to put them in a pan of warm water or warm the milk in a different bottle, then pour it in these. I don't have time for that at 3am, so I used regular Avent bottles instead."
2,To much work!!!,I'm a mother of a two month old. These bottles are to much work to put together. To much of a hassle. Just to keep less air in. Does it do the job for your baby to have less gas?? I don't think so. My baby would cry with all the gas he had!Waste of money!
2,Slow Delivery From Target Direct,Nine days from MN to PA seems too long; perhaps Target Direct got process problems. I AM NOT SATISIFIED...got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for $1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it.
5,Excellent!,"I buy this product for my sister, and I wanted to have these baby bottles whe my children were babies... Excellent!"
5,These bottles are great,"Our baby is almost 4 months old, and we love these bottles. I haven't had any problems with the vent bottoms wearing out, and only noticed film on the nipples when they didn't seem to be rinsed well enough after washing. We tried other slow flow nipples, but found that these work the best. Plus the bottles are so easy to clean, I don't have to worry about whether or not there is any build up left in a bottle that has been sitting for a while. I have been sanitizing the nipples and vent bottoms in the Medela Quick Steam Micro Clean bags (you use them in the microwave) and haven't had any problems with either of them."
1,liberal-bashing MIB rip off,"Take the basic premise of Men in Black, remove the humor, and then slather it with needless liberal-bashing. The over-the-top, forced politics really detract from the storyline. The author needlessly takes swipes at Carter, Clinton, and particulary rips into Kennedy...but no Republicans are criticized, not even Nixon. Lightweight reading, unless you really hate liberals, Hollywood, etc. However, if you think the only good liberal is a.....well, you may be able to guess the ending."
1,I don't get it...,"I've been a Crowes fan since the release of ""shake your money maker"", and always found something listenable on their disks, even on ""By Your Side""...this one, ""Lions"", just plain stinks. I don't know what they were thinking of, and it certainly isn't their best work. ""WarPaint"" is better; ""three snakes and one charm"" is better, even ""by your side"" is better. This one should have never made it out of the studio. I'm just glad I got it used and cheap, I would have hated paying full price for it..."
2,Interesting to say the least....,"Of all the Black Crowes albums I own, this has to be the least favorite. Given it has one great songs like Miracle to Me. In my opinion this album may have just been an excuse to pump one out for the record label. The Previous Crowes albums had songs on them that told stories of love depicted and described with music that was either catchy, great for driving, or just plain awsome. This album will take many listens on the cd player to acquire a love for it. THe songs are very repetitve lyrically and the music does not fit Robinson's lyrics. Not much else to say but to listen before you buy."
2,Done Already!!,This c.d. by the Crowes is subpar. It has been done in the 70's by at least 20 different bands. I thought I was listening to the soundtrack for LaughIn. I love their old stuff but this lacks originality. What happened to the energy displayed in their earlier recordings?
3,Let Him Play Too!,"Where is Audley Freed! I thought he was in the band but when you don't get to play but on 2 or 3 songs, I guess not. So I do not think he should be advertised as being in the band if you won't let him play on the studio stuff. He is a extremely talented guitarist who would show up the other guy (r.robertson), so I guess thats why he's not on the CD much. I just wished I knew that before I bought the CD. They ought to change the name to the Robertson Brothers Band!"
1,"Incredibly disturbing tale of parental neglect, which Conley evades by vaguely blaming The System","A sample passage from this borderline travesty:""Alexandra {Conley's elementary-school sister} got no further. She didn't get a chance to narrate how Jobina established baseline testicle measurements by flattering Mack with his manliness until he agreed to place his scrotum on her Weight Watchers scale; how she chartered the change in their mass after sex; how she confirmed her suspicions with scientific data""...Instead of explaining to her daughter the inappropriateness of such a classroom read-aloud and contritely apologizing to the school, we're told family matriarch Ellen Alexander Conley ""roared into the office...New York Times review in hand, Ellen declared that if the teacher or principal ever made Alexandra feel bad about herself or her mother's work again, she would file a complaint with the Board of Education.""Well, there's nothing like nurturing a sense of unwarranted grievance from birth!"
3,Beep Beep,And that's about all I got to say about a book the kids were required to read and which my kid found offensive.
1,NEVER EVER SIGN UP FOR DISH. BUNCH OF LIARS & CHEATS!,"I have been a subscriber of Dish Network for over a year now. And the customer representative called me to thank me for being a loyal customer and offer DVR on a promotion for $49 for me to own and keep for good. She NEVER told me that it was a leased equipment and that it was a 18 month contract. When I called them after seeing my bill of leasing fee, they 'apologised' for miscommunication but said that she disclosed all the disclosures. The proof for that is their damn system. There is nothing we can prove that she did not tell us anything. And finally I cancelled the existing service too along with DVR paying an early cancellation fee of $250. What a shame! I am going to Small Claims on this though it is not worth my time for $250, but it is definitely worth protecting new customers from getting into their racket."
1,was good..now major bad service,"I've been a dish customer for many years, at least 10. You might think - wow they can't be that bad, 10 years! They used to be good while they were trying to grow..they must have made their customer quota, they now will screw any customer. The customer service people can almost speak english..almost. But they are very good at letting you know:1) tough, you're screwed, that's too bad2) you must have screwed something up3) additional money from you can fix the problem, how about more programming channels?Their biggest money maker is their junk equipment. I can honestly say after 10 years their equipment is JUNK! I buy my equipment from them rather than rent which means I MUST also buy monthly maintenance from them on the equipment. They don't require the maintenance, the poor quality/longevity of the equipment demands the maintenance. Its a real shame, they used to be a really good company to be a customer of."
1,"slow, boring, ridiculous","I had wanted to see this movie for months but was terribly disappointed by it. It's implausible, slow, boring. I was hoping for a movie with some kind of message, but the only message seemed to be that hedonism and carelessness pay off? Ugh."
2,Soulless,"After about 30 minutes or so I gave up on this film. Nothing drawing me in, nothing I cared about, just didn't seem like a relevant commentary on life or death. I loved ""Six Feet Under"" and I thought Emma Thompson's ""Wit"" was a superb character film with a gut wrenching depiction of one person's death. In comparison ""The Guitar"" is a cold bland sandwich. It looks good at first until you actually taste it.A story about a character's death usually explores emotions. What are they feeling? Why (other than they're dying) are they feeling it? So this woman never learned to play the guitar and then uses the last few months of her life to do so. (Yeah right. As if she could learn that fast.) A soulless movie compared to the likes of ""Wit"" or just about any single episode of SFU."
5,fantastic!,"Very easy to understand, it sure makes a lot of sense and answered so many question I had for a long time; I think I'm going to read it again. Can hardly wait to read ""Smart Excercise"" Thank you Covert!"
4,It's fun and interesting.,"The book is great. My son had to read it for one of his college classes. When he was finished, I read it too. I learned a lot. It's very informative and easy to read."
4,Glass Bottles Make Their Return,"I am glad to see that glass bottles have not totally gone the way of the dinosaurs. Glass bottles make take a little more effort to clean,but they can be used for generation as long as kept clean."
5,Incredible quality for the price,"The picture quality is equal to or better than much pricier models. The built in DVD player, which plays Divx as well as every kind of disc, (except SACD and DVD-A) makes for a sleek, wall-mountable unit."
1,Arrived broken and without a power cord,Arrived broken and without a power cord.What else can I say...
3,Good way to kill time,"I liked this game but once you beat a certain mode you're done....the monsters were kind of annoying to.....good time filler, eapecially on a plane or something"
4,What is Romance?,"Thomas Moore relates his teachings to alot of poetry. If you don't like poetry then this is not for you. He uses the word 'Soul', alot. For those who are still finding out what 'soul' means I would recommend first reading some of Stuart Wilde's books or books on audio. 'Soul Mates' has alot of good tips that you can put into practice. One subject Moore covers is 'What is Romance'. I was impressed on how he explained the reality of romance. This has helped me in reviewing my expectations of my partner. A good book in general - I preferred the audio version."
1,A salve for the weak minded,"This book is intellectually worthless. It provides comfort to the weak, by soothing the mind into divorcing itself from thought. I'm amazed at the numbers of people who find comfort in it. They're likely the same fools who rush out to buy such garbage as the Chicken Soup for the Soul book. If you're a thinking person, don't waste your time on this book."
2,Thomas Moore Books,"I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul. I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style. Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much ""simpler form."" I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know."
3,They're okay.,"I gave this product 3 stars because they do help the health of my skin, however, as far as removing my makeup, it takes about 5 clothes to remove everything on my face at one time. I wear a normal amount of makeup. I would, however, buy these again. They smell pleasant,and do not burn at all. The price is reasonable enough for me to do so."
3,Max Payne Reviewed by - The Death Review:,"Alright so hear is the real deal:Max is a cool dude, and the game is entertaining enough to fork out the green dollar bills. There are a few things that really annoy me about the game. But, there are not bad enough that I would refrain from getting it.Cons:1. The Audio is too quiet. Compared to other games on the XBox, like Halo, and Gotham, this game is really quiet. It's hard to hear the dialog, and the soundtrack. Gun shots are fine in volume.2. When someone is shooting at you from behind, you have to literally rotate your whole body in order to get him. You can't just turn around and shoot. I can't stand that.3. It's a little dark. It's hard to see what's going on.Pros:Over all it is fun to play. Yeah, there are some parts that I could do without, but most games are not perfect. So if you want an entertaining game to hold you over until Brute Force and Ghost Recon get released, get MAX PAYNE.."
5,Pretty Good,"In the first level of the game, Max comes home to his house to find that it has been ransacked and that the bad guys are still there. He goes up stairs and hears his wife and baby crying. They are both then killed in a very dramatic, and a very disturbing way. THIS IS A VERY CREEPY GAME! The content of the game shouldn't be heard by little kids under 10 yrs old. It involves very very crude language (example): "" Hey Tony, just kill any motherf**ker that gets off this d**m f**king subway"". Many of the bad guys talk like this. their's also very dramatic opening scenes that scare me. I'm 13 and I don't think kids under my age should see this. This game disturbs me; but it is a very fun game that draws you in with many cut-scenes that are very interestingGraphics: 4-nit the best, but very creepy lightingimmersion: 5-very very deep immersion. I was drawn in after the first five minutes(literally)Fun-Factor: 5-this game is very fun. using bullet time allows you to not get hurt most of the time"
2,Worst game ever!!,"I bought this game when I got my xbox. first off the graphics of this game is the same as ps1, if not worse! it looks like they have just taken the PC version changed a few things and released it for the xbox! second the controlling is really bad you cant turn him just with one of the joysticks you have to use one for walking and the other one to turn him which was irritating becuase of the camera angles!! Tomb raider was a much better game then max Payne!! dont waste your money on this game."
2,fun dies quickly,"its a very fun game, i suggest not using the cheats or it will ruin the game (until youve beat it that is). the matrix-esque style and storyline is great, but the game is very short, and it leaves you feeling just that , short. for [the money] you might want to get eldeer scrolls 3: morrowind which has virtually hundreds of hours of gameplay, or UFC: tapout.... this game gets a 1 out of 5 stars for replayability. i beat it once and havent been back since.... it would have been cheaper to go to the arcade and spend ... bucks anbd i would have got more fun out of that. my advice, look at the other great games for xbox and skip this one... (the graphics kind of [are bad] as well, as this game was intended for PS2 and doesnt take advantage of the xbox's full power)"
1,Get off of yourself!,"I knew nothing about Russ Whitney before reading this book. I was just looking for some insights on real estate investing. Sorry to say, the book was filled with personal life stories and bogus strategies! I found myself skip reading by the third chapter just to look for the informative information (general at that) I was looking for! This book should of been an autobiography."
1,Nothing new except great marketing for additional programs,"I read this book a while back and was inspired to continue my education in real estate. In fact, I went to his millionaire U program and it was more of an inspirational pep rally to invest in more of his other programs...Yes, he made money in Real Estate but he discovered that it was easier making more money from selling his programs to people who need a quick way to wealth. There is no quick way to wealth except through hard work and discipline. Reality bites..."
1,Book Review -- Building Wealth: From Rags to Riches with Rea,"Unfortunately, the rating system does not allow for a below zero rating- which is where this book belongs.Having completed a 25 year career in mortgage banking, I can tell you that bankers are not as stupid as Whitney would lead you to believe. The techniques that Whitney offers in dealing with bankers- simply will not work.Similar to other snake oil salesmen, Whitney discusses the OPM (other people's money) or no downpayment techniques to purchasing real estate.These are great techniques in real estate markets that are so depressed that bank financing is not available. This is not the case in most real estatet markets in America today- especially in light of the current economy.A reader would be better off buying books explaing the windfalls being made on Ocean Front Properties in Arizona."
4,abortion rights,"This movie is about whether a woman should have complete rights over her body, uterus and life. The couple start out great, but then she realizes he has terrible dark and violent moods, thinks he may have even harmed an ex gf. She always forgives him and comes home one night, happy about being told she's pregnant and bursting to share the news with him. He erupts at her before she has time to tell him her news, he rapes her and she cowers in fear from him. She breaks up with him and decides to get an abortion - only to find out that her psycho/cruel ex bf has alreayd contacted her Dr and mentions how happy they both are, eventho they are going thru some difficulties.It gets worse and worse from there... he kidnaps her and locks her in a secluded cabin until it's too late for her to legally get an abortion. He kills and manipulates individuals and the judicial system - ultimately disgusting - but he gets his!"
3,daughter love it,My daughter loves this item. Doesn't work to well on carpet but on hard surfaces it's fine. Horse lovers favorite.
4,under 13? use our kid's review form,"The product I received as a replacement is great.I also give Amazon on a scale form 0-10.I give Amazon a 11 for customer service.It is a great site and I recommend it to all my friends,family and co workers too. Thanks for the great service and have a wonderful day.Sincerely,Rita Warde"
2,Cool Shot Problem,"Great blowdryer when it works. Suddenly, out of the blue, the cool shot button ceased to work. It is upsetting because I heavily rely on that function of the blowdryer."
3,"Too much extra stuff, not enough docking","Bought the book to get detailed help docking my sailboat in challenging wind/current/space situations. I was especially interested in clever ways to 'warp' in under power with spring lines etc. The book was a disapointment: lots of stuff about coming _alongside_ a dock -- a very rare thing in my experience with crowded, finger-piered marinas. Very little about pilings in wind and current, almost nothing about warping.You will pick useful nuggets that make the book worth the price, but for practical tips on touch situations Chapman's Seamanship and Small Boat Piloting has way more info."
3,I should have bought this in the 80's when I first saw it.,"After purchasing Savatage's ""The Wake Of Magellan"" I was interested in some of the band's back-catalog and this was one of the albums I purchased, having remembered seeing it years ago in the mid-80's (After all of these years I still remembered the album cover).In some respects this is an uneven album with some songs much stronger than the others, still, it is a great example of why the 80's was such a great decade for heavy metal. There is a lot of very strong guitar work and vocals here as well as a general rawness to the sound which is very satisfying.Savatage has made superior albums but this one holds up well to the others. I just wish I had gone ahead and purchased this years ago when I saw it. If I had I wouldn't have had to wait 18 years before becoming a fan."
4,A moral tale with a twist ending,"I was reading an article about overrated and underrated westerns in a magazine recently and the author cited this movie as one of the underrated westerns. I had not heard of it, but always liked Randolph Scott, so I decided to get the movie. I was not dissapointed.It has good action scenes, plus a good moral message as well. I also enjoyed the surprise ending, which caps of the movie very well. I recommend this movie highly."
4,Scary as I remembered.,"I had the good fortune of stumbling across a copy of this in a video store ""used"" bin. I snapped it up (for $6) and watched it immediatly upon getting home. I, like the other reviewer, was surprised to find it was only a half hour long, but was thrilled to find it was still as creepy as I remembered it. It scared the poop out of me as a kid, and it was a ball to watch as an adult.If you happen to come across a copy of this flick, buy it -- you'll be happy you did."
3,Slightly Disappointing,"Great vocalists covering great material, but, sorry other reviewers, it misses the mark. Lisaten to it again folks and I think you might admit that it's not a 5 star collection. Too many of the musical arrangements and performances are perfunctory at best, and downright pedestrian at times. Over the album as a whole its all too samey and lacks the drive and attack of Van's recordings. Its fine as a reasonable example of this type of thing, but it should have blown me away. As it is its hardly even a breeze."
5,"A practical and enjoyable ""must read"" for playwrights","This is a book that both beginning and professional playwrights should find helpful as well as enjoyable. As its title suggests, it is a ""toolkit"" filled with practical, down-to-earth information on the craft of playwriting. Jeffrey Sweet has written a wonderful resource book that should be read and re-read. It is never far from my desk!"
5,This is the best Tiesto's by far,This release is Tiesto's best DVD. I was anxious to get it and the long wait it worths. The balance between songs is great but my favorite is the 2nd disc . The images are clear and caught you in Tiesto's energetic mood including the special features. You can't stop dancing at the end. Is a must for Tiesto's fans.
1,Where are the MP3?,"The show is amazing, but I have to qualify this as a product and it's missing something important for me: the MP3!You can't sell something and deliver less than the supposed!"
5,Party all day,I am satisfied buying this item (2 DVD's in one set) which includes an extra song by JES and also a live presentation of Julie Thompson in one of the disks. Nice music to hear and watch at any time.
4,"Hey, it's Roberts Rules...not a Danielle Steel.","Dry and straight to the point...yup this is a classic. You've got to have it if you run meetings, though. Parli pro never goes out of style."
5,Robert's Rules of Order: Newly Revised,Needed this book for advice on keeping minutes and it is true to its history ...
2,Formatting?,"This Kindle edition of Robert's Rules is serviceable if you know what you're looking for, but regrettably the formatting is off and the index is next to useless. Also, the search function yields unusable results. Certainly worth the price as an emergency resource, but not ultimately useful if one is attempting to put together a paperless reference library. A veteran Parliamentarian might enjoy this edition, but a novice might find it difficult."
2,"Kindle version is the ""POCKET GUIDE""","I wanted the whole thing, the complete book, but this is the ""pocket guide."" If you look hard enough on the web page for this item, you will see that it is the ""Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies."" I didn't look hard enough before I bought it, but I should have figured the entire book wouldn't be available on Kindle for $0.99 when the paperback is $12. If it was the whole book for Kindle it would have been about $10! Fortunately, I figured it out before my 7 days were up and I was able to return it. Maybe you'll read this and save yourself the trouble."
1,Poorly formatted edition,"While I hold the work itself in high regard, this edition is so poorly formatted as to render it unreadable. Among other issues, line wrapping is misaligned perhaps due to hard carraige returns."
1,Who formatted this book...,"Don't waste your time on downloading the kindle version of this book. It is TERRIBLE. Even the table of contents is misplaced (it is in the back). It makes it difficult not only to read, but to search and find any specific issue. As another reviewer noted it has no page numbering to go with the pages listed in the TOC. I returned it after purchase. It is good to know that Amazon does return your purchase price without any hassel."
5,"How Did You Paint That? 100 Ways to Paint Seascapes, Rivers & Lakes","This book came in a timely manor and it's condition was like new. I have not used the book yet, but feel that it will be a good source of referencefor me when I paint."
3,Censored Book,"This book is censored. Fine for a school library, but not true to the artists actual drawings."
4,Cheap but decent.,"I use this printer mainly as a cheap replacement for a dying laserjet, and it completes my tasks perfectly. mind you, i'm mostly printing text documents and pdf's, so there isn't a high requirement in color or detail, but it more than gets the job done for the price."
1,Poor Technical Support,"Just bought the product today and had a horrible time installing, I called tech support and was told it was a puter issue...so I spent $39.99 on the printer, then $75 for a service call - only to find out it was the CD that came with the printer. Worst customer service from a company! Good Luck. I haven't even printed anything out and already know I will never buy another Lexmark product again."
3,A further example of Howes' genius if not songwriting abilit,"I,d like to say, firstly, that this album will be enjoyed by Howe lovers. All of those in the know appreciate that Howe is technically brilliant and unique...no small feat when one acknowledges the myriad session guitarist phenoms. I'd like to comment on the review that Amazon.com chose to quote in it's on-line review section. Who is the ""pretentious and boring"" reviewer who essentially thrashed the entire body of Yes' work? Oh, let's see if we can overread into the ""sour-tasting and pompous vision, and fantastically bad poetry"". Enjoy the sounds, your review was ""a joyless exercise"". Howe is one of the best guitarists on the planet, and not a bad ""late 20th century classical composer""."
1,VCD quality DVDs..probably bootlegs!,"I got burned with this copy of Rurouni Kenshin Complete Collection. The printing on the cover and discs are subquality as well as the resolution of the videos, VCD quality to be precise! I guess the price was too good to be true. WARNING!! Be sure to know what you are buying before you do..don't get burned like me!"
3,Poor quality,"The Puzzle is OK, but the quality is awful.I bought this Puzzle with an aluminum case and received in a plastic case with poor quality already.The price is higher than others offers.An absurd!Waiting for seller answer to solve this problem at all!"
5,Quality fun & time with the family,This game allows quality fun & time with the family. Much better than sitting in front of the TV.
5,Great product!,I just received my Cardinal Industries Mexican Train Domino Game in an Aluminum Case and am thrilled that it came so quickly (I'm previewing Amazon Prime and will definitely subscribe when my preview is up.) I ordered the game on Sunday and it was here by Tuesday afternoon. All of the dominoes were there and they were in great shape. The paint was fine with no extra marks or damage. The aluminum case came with a plastic insert to keep all of the dominoes in place when being carried. I couldn't be more pleased!!! A+++
3,Its ok,"The bowls are low quality. The stainless steel is pretty thin. My major annoyance with it was the glue used on the packaging/advertisements on it had to be laboriously scraped off and still left the bowls feeling tacky.The stand is ok. It does not slip when our pup eats from it (he's a 3lb morkie). The bowls are a decent size for him. Of course, he doesn't eat as much as the bowl will hold. so we only give him what he needs.Main reason for buying these bowls - tear stains. Apparently feeding your pet out of a stainless steel bowl is supposed to help. I think wiping his face twice a day is more effective, but whatever keeps him healthy."
4,Classic tales on creatures of the night.,"Rather than a collection of modern-day stories, this collection features tales through the ages that start from the 1816 and range until the publication of the book. Among the edition are several classics, such as George Gordon and Lord Byron's ""Fragment of a Novel,"" an excerpt from ""Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood"" by James Malcom Rymer, Bram Stoker's ""Dracula's Guest"" and ""Carmilla."" Modern writers include Robert Bloch's ""The Living Dead"" and Tanitha Lee's ""Bite-Me-Not or, Fleur de Feu."""
2,NO GREEN ONIONS,"OVERALL SOUND QUALITY ONLY FAIR TO POOR.NOT AS LISTED ON WEB SITE.NO GREEN ONIONS TRACK, HOW CAN THE BEST-OF LEAVE OUT GREEN ONIONS?TOOK TOO LONG TO SHIP.DID THEY BURN-IT IN THE BASEMENT?"
5,Great intro to elementary concepts in math,"This well-written book introduces some of the most elementary concepts in math in a very simple language. The text is quite engaging and interesting, so even the more knowledgeable people will enjoy reading the book."
5,Classic and brilliant!,One of the greatest reggae albums ever written! You don't even have to be a pot smoker to enjoy it. They give king Bob a run for his money with this album.
3,Witty but really just for gardeners,"I received this book from a friend who is a passionate gardener and who thought this was the loveliest thing she had read in years. My great passion is reading, not getting dirty in the garden, but she thought that I would still share her enthusiasm.To a certain extent I do, and it is certainly full of warm and witty stories and anecdotes relating to the joys of gardening. But it is just that which has failed to hold my attention. It is about gardening.If you can find a copy for a gardening friend, or if your greatest joy is planting, weeding and identifying obscure flowers, you will adore this book. If not you will still appreciate its warm humour.A nice book, which could be truly wonderful, depending on your ties with the garden!"
3,Pretty Good,"This book got me interested in conspiracy theories. There are some generalizations and leaps in logic to be sure, but all told it's quite convincing."
5,Great case for the DSC-H1 Camera,I received my new DSC-H1 camera several weeks ago and just received this case. It works great with the option for either using on belt or over shoulder. There is an external zippered pocket for extra batteries and/or memory and plenty of room in the case for the camera. Nicely padded - quality indicative of a good Sony product.
5,Does the job-no complaints,"As with most of the Sony equipment and accessories that I have, the Sony LCS-HA case for my H5 is very well put together. The Velcro insert fits just where it should, and the camera sits barrel down, with the lens hood on. One point about this: the best fit is with the large hood section reversed. H2 and H5 owners will know what I mean. The case is quite well padded, and that is worth more to me than size. I know there have been minor complaints about the hardware being made of plastic, but as yet I have had no reason to be concerned, and there have been times when I wasn't as gentle as I should have been. Stuff happens. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
3,LCS-HA - just does the job and nothing more,"Does the bare minimal job of keeping the camera safe.Looks - 1 stars (very big, 1 1/2 times than the camera, mine is a DSC-H2)Material used - 3 starsSize/Shape - 1 star - very awkward, doesn't go with the shape of the cameraDurability - 3 stars - seems to be goodUsage - 2 stars - very uncomfortable to fit in the camera. The camera goes inside only in one angle, and since the case shape is (awkward) not similar to that of camera, you need to remember the *position* in which you have to keep the camera inside every time (if you don't care to bother such things). And in times of need (when a party is going on and you want to be fast in clicking the snaps), better keep the case off in your car and move around with the camera until the party ends :)Overall it is not worth for DSC-H2, only if you can't invest some more for a higher version, go for it."
4,MONEY MONEY MONEY...,"At least one scene of LITTLE FOXES is part of movie history : The final scene between Bette Davis and Herbert Marshall. You have to see it to understand why Bette Davis was so admired in the 1930-1950 period. Evil in all its splendor ; without make-up, special effects and oppressive musical score.LITTLE FOXES is what one can call a ""classic"" movie directed by William Wyler, a director whose films collect an impressive amount of Oscars during 25 years.Classic does not always mean boring. You will certainly appreciate a movie with clever dialogs, convincing actors and a story mixing particuliar family problems with general economic questions.I would have liked a little more madness in the treatment of the subject but you can't always have all you desire, can you ?A DVD for Bette Davis fan or future fan."
5,Another Bumpy Ride for Bette,"Bette Davis is in fine form in one of her strongest roles. With a strong ensemble cast, ""Tne Little Foxes"" keeps the viewer on the edge of their chair, with a wonderful script by Lillian Hellman.This is truely a classic Bette Davis vehicle that I can watch over and over again, because of the vicious Regina she creates.If you think ""All About Eve' was a bumpy ride, you haven't seen anything yet until you see ""The Little Foxes."""
5,The BEST!!!,"After a lot of research, I got this model. We couln't be hap[pier with its two blades, speed and efficiency, and size of operation.Definitely well made, and the best bang for the buck, decent weight and stability. Equal or better than ones costing MUCH more, and heavier than this one. The extra grating/slicing blade is icing on the cake because they all eventually get dull and can't be sharpened, then cost plenty to replace and ship.The next lower one isn't as well made, and more expensive ones have more problems and are big and heavy. This is reliable and easy to store, and operate, for jobs big and small. Love it!!! It really IS the BEST!!!"
1,Does not slice properly,"The Hamilton Beach 70670 Chef, 525 Watt Processor will not slice potatoes - it mashes them going through slicer. Very disappointed. I have several Hamilton Beach products and this is the only one I have been disappointed in."
4,Hamilton Beach Food Processor model 70670,This ia avery good food processor. My wife really likes it. We replaced another food processor that had a chute to discharge sliced and shredded items but it always leaked badly when processing large quantities of liquids. This one does not have the same problem.
4,really like!!,"I bought this to replace my old HEAVY 1980's Cuisenart food processor. I know that some would say ""WHY would you replace your Cuisanart??"".Well, for one, most of the attachments were missing except for the basic blade. 2nd, the Cuisanart was HEAVY and I hated lifting it to use it. What a pain! Perhaps the weight indicated it was better made (more metal, less plastic) but i never used it cause it was too much of a pain to haul around.I really like this new one however. I have used it several times and it does the job. It makes food processing much more pleasant and I actually look forward to making things like slaws etc..."
4,fabulous!,"This Hamilton Beach food processor is wonderful in many ways. It's made very simple, so it's simple to clean. It's lightweight with suction cups on the bottom for security and it processes food beautifully. I have tried many new things with this appliance and fresh ground coffee is my next attempt. My only complaint is the very thin plastic bowl which has already broken along the top edge. other than that, it's money very well spent!"
3,Warning,"I haven't even tried this yet and am already unhappy with it. The ""optional"" second disc is ONLY available through Hamilton Beach. The disc is $10.00, the cheapest shipping is $8.00. So a single disc costs 50% of the entire machine. So if you want to fine shred or crinkle cut be prepared to spend another $20 or so."
4,"Cute house, but plastic is thin!","This Barbie house is so neat! The sounds, the layout and accessories are impressive. However, it is all plastic and yes, some of the windows do pop out. But super glue will fix the problem. I haven't had much of a problem yet with the windows but time will tell and I will super glue them if they pop out continuously. I did a lot of research & compared many doll houses before buying this one and I have no regrets buying this barbie house! Just prepare yourself for the windows to pop out and the box is shipped in the manufactuers box, so if it's a gift for your own child make sure you are aware of when it's out for delivery! I would recommend this barbie house & the look on my girls faces Christmas morning when they saw this Barbie house was worth every penny!"
3,*** Barbie 3-Story Dream House,"Well, some small pieces were broken inside the sealed package from the manufacturer and they do not ship replacement parts, they ask that you exchange the item. (dumb) Very difficult assembly, loads of small pieces and stickers, the directions were very vague. You had to study the picture on the box to assemble.Once assembled, it is very nice and my daughter has had loads of fun with it.Downside is it's size. It doesn't fold up well, so storage is a problem."
4,Great for Imaginative Play,"Our triplet girls really have enjoyed the Barbie Dream House. It is wonderful to see the imagination at work in their ""stories"" and play acting. They work out problems and play out issues they seein their world. They enjoy the different levels of the house and all the accessories. They think the little elevator is the coolest. If this product can withstand my triplet 5 year olds it is relatively sturdy."
2,Barbie Dream House - No sound when delivered,"My 4-year old daughter certainly loved playing with this on Christmas morning, but none of the sounds worked after it was assembled. Three sets of new batteries were used to try to get the sounds to work, but to no avail. The people at the Mattel hotline said there was nothing that they could do, that there isn't a part to send to me for replacement. They suggested I take it back to the merchant. But since it's so huge and purchased online, sending it back isn't practical. No complaint against Amazon specifically (they sent a sealed box, ahead of schedule), but purchasing online makes it difficult to take care of defective items. The price on Amazon was the best I saw ($89 and change), but after I purchased it from Amazon, I saw the same price at Toys R Us and Wal-Mart. Purchasing there would have provided an more practical option to have the defective toy replaced."
4,Barbie 3 story dream house,My daughter got this for Christmas and just loves it. My niece and her have a great time playing with it. They love the doorbell and the music. One can play on each side of it or they can play side by side. My daughter did snap the spiral staircase part that holds the barbie doll off trying to get Barbie off of it.When dealing with plastic what can you expect.Overall this is a great toy.
5,great toy for my 5 year old,"I bought the doll house for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. She spends hours playing with it. It's not difficult to put together either, only takes a few minutes. The only thing to be careful of is it does get delivered in the original box. I heard about this before purchasing so I had a separate delivery address. My daughter was very surprised."
3,Not as sturdy as hoped.,"There is a lot going on with this house. A lot of pieces that have to fit just so or else it won't work correctly. Even before I opened the box, one of the handles on the 3 story was broken, so I have to see about getting a new one. Come on, Santa's elves aren't supposed to make faulty toys. I see that when my 7 year old plays with it, windows fall out, all the small pieces seems too little for her hands. She's thrilled, but I would have reconsidered if I had known all this beforehand."
1,dissatisfied with Amazon,"If I had actually received the product, I would be happy. I placed my order on Nov 28, 2006 with the item ""IN STOCK"". It was to be delivered at the latest Dec 14th, with the supersaver shipping. Knowing that the super saver shipping sometimes has delays, I gave it the weekend and Mon & Tues of the following week. On Wednesday I made calls to UPS and to Amazon, only to find out that the Barbie house was ""lost"" and never made it off the loading dock. I received no notification from Amazon saying that there was a problem with the order. They processed a refund to my account the next day because the item was no longer available. We finally found a replacement ""Bratz Villa"" (not what we wanted really) on Ebay at twice the cost and no other place (believe me we searched statewide), but didn't want to dissapoint the kids and it arrived the day before Christmas Eve. Just a word of caution- pay for the shipping and you might get your item."
3,Flash but no substance,"As with every larger Barbie product, the Dream House is flimsily made but does have fun extras like a flushing toilet and spinning washer/dryer. Only a very small object can fit in the washer/dryer for it to work. I pulled open one of the doors and the handle fell off. I think if this house is played with often, it'll fall apart as nothing feels sturdy. It is dramatic because of it's size and my daughter was ecstatic to receive it so it was worth it."
2,Barbie Dream House...buyer beware,"We bought this dollhouse for our almost 4 year old daughter and SHE loves it!!!!!!!! The problem is the thing has totally fallen apart!! The plastic is so flimsy and cheap it broke in several places when ""santa"" was putting it together on Christmas Eve. The elevator lift thingy broke when she was trying to crank the doll up the stairs. All of the windows keep popping out and the doors won't stay on. Also this house comes with lots of accessories but beware they are TEENY TINY!!! I put them all in a ziploc bag and she can have them to play with when she's about nine or ten years old!! Amazon has been awesome with my request for a return on this product...the only trouble is that despite how poorly the Barbie Dream House is made...my little one still loves it better than any of the other ones she's seen!"
3,Great but needs,"This toy was a great surprise for my 5 1/2 yr old for Christmas...But you know what for all that money you would think that they would have a KITCHEN TABLE AND AT LEAST 2 CHAIRS, and extra chair for the living room ....But to have a HUGE doll house and not a kitchen table to put all those annoying tiny food items is really cheaping out...I am on the look out for something that at least could be put on the rug by the kitchen...Hey Barbie needs to eat right???"
2,"Há, há, há","THis is a silly AC/DC album. Simon Wright's drumming is awful, the lyrics are a shame. For all of you that say this is ""great"", ""underrated"", whatever, I must remind you that none ( I repeat: none !! ) of the songs of this album still is in their live act."
1,I was deceived by the reviews...,"I am sorry but other reviewers should somehow participated in the making of this dvd, otherwise my capabilities don't allow me to understand their ratings. BAD music, Cheap Stars, terrible ambience, background sucks so much, NOTHING in here... Did I mention how the music sucks ??? Damn, I am sorry for my 20 bucks. Do not waste your money and time on this amateurly produced DVD... BEWARE."
1,I can't believe it !,"There are lots of scratchs at locker of the briefcase. It came locked and no unlock code or key.I paid for a new item and they sent me used one ,over and above not in a good condition ! For The rest it's a good briefcase."
2,The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System,"I bought this book primarily for my 17 year old son who knows nothing about exposure. It is probably not bad for a rank beginner, but the whole thing could have easily been condensed and thoroughly discussed in 30-40 pages. I fear my fairly intelligent son will be just about as bored as I was even though he doesn't understand exposure and I've been taking pictures for 40+ years."
2,Simple Concepts For Simple People,"the book obviously seeks to ensure that it doesn't confuse. To do so it assumes it is addressing 10 year olds. Whilst this means it eventually gets its concepts across, it could of saved my time. Other books on exposure get the same ideas across, but in a more expedient manner (at least for adults).In the end the Zone system and exposure is a matter of judgement (as to the level of contrast, where the tone of the main subject lies etc) and no amount of simplification can get passed that."
3,"Good performance, mediocre quality","Installed these bulbs in my Toyota 4Runner and noticed an improvement in performance over my previous headlights. They are definitely not HID level but that is hard to expect without installing a whole new system.The longevity, however, is NOT good. Bought these bulbs nearly three years ago and one bulb has died with only moderate driving and usage of the bulbs. I've noticed other reviews mentioning even shorter life spans.UPDATE 11/23/12: After a couple more years the other bulb is still going strong so lifespan can vary. In exchange for better performance over my factory bulbs I think I'm willing to exchange a little in shorter durability."
5,new lights,one of the lights on my truck burnt out so i decided to upgrade and get these. they don't seem much brighter but it would probably help if i got new headlight lenses (they are 21 years old and faded out).
5,"Getting these is a ""bright"" idea...","These lights are MUCH brighter than the stock bulbs for any car that I've dealt with. I've replaced stock with Silverstars and now Silverstar Ultras on every one of my cars and recommended them to others on their cars. I had a friend who said that it should be ""illigal"" to use the stock headlights after I replaced the ones on his Jeep Cherokee with the Silverstars.I have used the Sylvania Line for several years now. I find that they last a very reasonable amount of time, although I have heard several complaints made about them I think they last about 2 years on my wife's car and I have had the Silverstars in place as my fog lights since about 2006 and they are still working just fine (that's 6 years ago). I don't use them all the time, but they are still great!Not much more to say, they are VERY bright and last about 2 years for our use. That's just about as much as I would need them to last under normal circumstances, so I'm very happy with them."
1,Wrong part,Ordered these for my FJ Cruiser. After removing the old bulbs it was obvious that the new ones were different. I notified Amazon that the part number is incorrect. The bulbs were returned and the refund process was a breeze!
5,Strongly Recommended,"These lights are certainly brighter than the stock Sylvania bulbs and the color temperature is higher, in other words, the light is whiter compared to the more amber stock ones. Definitely worth buying. My 1990 Nissan Sentra's lights are now up to current standards. I should buy another set."
2,Italian Wolves,"Almost all of this is about wolves in Italy. I don't know if these are a different sub-species, but they're nothing like North American timber wolves; they're small, thin, short-haired, i.e. you will never see the wolf on the cover in the video. You'd have to be a real wolf fanatic to find this interesting."
5,One Of My Favorites,"I've owned this book for almost ten years. While I use other risotto recipes for inspiration, I use the proportions and instructions in this book exclusively.While some recipes aren't the greatest, my opinion probably reflects my personal preferences, not the authors' abilities. And, some recipies (like the one for shrimp, truffle oil, and squash) are worth the price of the entire book! (That recipe, I might add, has caused several friends to go out a purchase a copy for themselves.)Overall an excellent, much-used addition to my cookbook collection."
4,My 4 year old daughter loves it!,I got this game pack for my daughter's 4 year old friend's birthday. My daughter loves playing all the games in the pack and it is all kept neatly in the backpack. I think it is educational and also a good thing for parents and older siblings to do with the younger child.
5,hydrafase,"I liked the smell and the texture of the lotion. It is not oily at all, what is great. I am waiting on the results.:)"
4,Wish there was more!,"The 4 songs on this CD are absolutely fabulous. I wish their were more. I am looking forward to new music from them in the future. The lead singer, Jen, really rocks. She has a very burly voice for a chick. She sounds very similar to the male vocalist for the Black Crowes, Chris Robinson. They have a very nice edge that isn't too rough."
5,Sparse and Heavy,"This set shows Tubby and Jah Screw mixing Roots Radics rhythms in a stark, dry, bass-heavy style. Judicious use of echo and the most subtly mutating snare-reverb effects of any Tubby production necessitate a careful listen that rewards with mindblowing intensity. If you like your dub busy with garish effects, this might not be the set for you. But if you crave mashing bass and dub as a fine art, this is as good as it gets."
3,hardly dangerous,"ordinary early eighties dub from the master king tubby. not the best, but an enjoyable listen none the less."
4,Good and clean,The sound is clean and the center works very well. the sound is not easily disterce. The size is also very good. Could be cheaper.
3,I received it,"There were some issues getting them to work, except this breakdown is almost certainly attributable to my environment more than the speakers themselves."
3,"Center is fine, as for the rear surrounds...","The center channel is very good for the package price; produces more than adequate vocals. Rear surround's sound great too...until you want to pump the volume up on that favorite action scene. In my mid-size living room (20x14), they begin to destort at modest levels. If you want the house-shaking, window-rattling theater experience, better get something a little bigger."
4,It SEEMS to work,"When I started a new job, I began traveling a lot and seemed to get a cold sore every time I hit the road. Guess it was due to the stresses of traveling. I saw this in the in flight magazines every time I flew and decided to give it a try. Nothing worse than showing up at a business meeting with a big cold sore on the bottom lip!After six months, I THINK that it works. Since I started using it, I have gotten far fewer cold sores and they are far less severe. I don't really know if it's the DermaSeptic because I still use the ice cube trick, Abreava, and Campho-Phenique.Regarding the conducting gel that comes with this, I found that alcohol hand cleaning gel works just as well and I like the idea of it being an antiseptic. Also, the Campho-Phenique gel works, too, although I only use it on the part that touches my lip. On the side of the device, I use the cheaper hand cleaning gel.So, I am pretty sure that it's helping keep these cold sores at bay."
1,it does not work,"I tried the product a couple of times. Id doesn't work. i religiously follow the instruction, i use it at the first tingle. It didn't make any difference.don't waste your money."
5,DermaSeptic comes in a kit...,"I ordered the DermaSeptic unit two weeks ago, but had to wait for its arrival to find out everything that was included in my purchase.The DermaSeptic unit comes in a clear plastic hardshell case with:a) complete instructions (includes instructions on how to replace the litium CR2032 battery)b) the DermaSeptic unit itselfc) small emery board (needed to clean silver tip)d) conductive gel (use between silver tip and affected skin area AND between the backside of the unit and your finger)I'm looking forward to using the DermaSeptic to stop cold sores from fully developing."
5,THE SMELL OF FEAR,"AN ABSOLUTELY CLASSIC LOOK AT THE BUSINESS OF BUSINESS AND THE BUSINESS OF BEING. THIS BOOK WILL TOUCH YOU. AFTER READING THIS FUNNY, INSIGHTFUL, PASSIONATE LOOK AT LIFE AS SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF RILEY McREYNOLDS YOU WILL NOT FEEL THE SAME ABOUT YOURSELF. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR."
5,Loved Lost,"purchased this game for my son (age 25 - big Lost fan) - although it looked complicated to me, he picked it right up and loved the game - his girlfriend loves it as well - as do all his good buddies - even those that don't watch the show. If you like the show and like boardgames, you will want this on your game table!"
1,"bad, no no no no no!!!!",Do not get this game!!! Very very boring. Battling is painfully unrealistic and stupid. Takes forever to gain levels.Every aspect of this game is disappointing.
5,Awesome,This game is super fun and super addicting. I really enjoy it and its put together well. I definitly think everyone should get this game
1,Its comming to Xbox too.,"Just wait till Phantasy Star comes to the Xbox. The release dates will be very close (if not the same), but the Xbox version will be much much better. Not just the better graphics and sleaker controls, but the fact that voice chat and faster online gameplay, thanks to Xbox's broadband, will add a better experience to the whole world of Phantasy Star."
4,makeover time,The doll is cool and my daughter loves it however the makeup that comes with it was expired. I bought it for her for Christmas back in october and the makeup has an expiration date of last december. But I paid a good price for it and the makeup can be replaced
2,thumbs down,Doesn't releave ache & pain as adveritised would not order it again will stay with the roll on I have.
2,ick,"I loved everything Grand Central had ever released...until now. This is just not good. It's got no soul (not as in the music genre, but as in feeling, emotion, spirit etc.). Basically, it sounds like a computer put it together with no help whatsoever from mankind. A couple of decent tracks, but overall, a big disappointment."
4,Cap vs. Snk,"Just wana say that this game is ok but its not like marvle vs capcon. this game is like the street fighter anniversary collection, the old school cheap graphics but even so its entertaining. If you want the real deal with a street fighter game defenatly check out marvle vs capcon, but i must warn you the price is rediculous, but hey if you got the money then go for it."
5,Another magical book,Once again Mary Pope Osborne has created a magical book to sweep the children away. She cannot write them fast enough according to my children!!!
5,Desert Savanna!,The book is AWESOME!Its about when Jack and Annie go to a desert in search for the city of Baghad and its mighty caliph!But when they get seperated from their carivan it gets harder!Read this book to find out more...
3,Bad influence,This doll is a bad influence for children. She is wearing way too much make-up. She is more like a Goth Bratz instead of a Mid-night Dance Bratz.
4,fianna,"her face and hair is really pretty. she is kinda dressed down though for a ""midnight dance."" overall, it's a nice doll."
2,... whoops.,"I would not know if the quality of this particular screen protector is good or not... because I have not used it. I was under the impression that this protector would fit my Zune HD touchscreen... alas, it does not even come close. A warning to all Zune HD users: do NOT spend money on this protector! It does look like it would fit one of the second-gen Zunes, though."
4,Exactly what I expected,"This is definitely a step up from the first Full on Ferry DVD. I was far more interested in seeing the documentary over the Full on Ferry event. The only reason this did not get five stars is that when it mentions guest DJs in the DVD, they don't actually get to mix on film. I would have liked to see more action from the guest DJs. Overall - great investment."
4,Great for Joyschool,"I ordered these for my daughters Joyschool class, since I was teaching about doctors. They were perfect--inexpensive, reasonable shipping cost, and they actually worked. The kids just loved them, and were so excited that they were able to take them home to play doctor. I wasn't expecting much because of the cost, but it was really fun for the kids to be able to listen to heart beats. I'm sure that it will be a much more memorable class because I was able to find these. The sound is kind of soft, but it does pick up heartbeats. I can't imagine it being very useful to a real doctor or nurse, but it did work really well for my purposes."
1,"If you love beads, nothing new you can find here.","This book is probably the one for those who never played with beads before. However, if you are enthusiastic and looking for some inspiration or information to explore further the world of bead embroidery, there are so many other books that satisfy you, but not this."
5,Great disinfectant,The Magic Mist Mouthpiece spray does its job. I would never use it as a case freshener - that concept disturbs me. But it's wonderful for mouthpieces.
2,Even Junior Vasquez fails to save this song.,"I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am) on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied."
2,Awful,I love Free (and Bad Co to a lesser extent) and I love Led Zep. but this was awful. Bad 80's production. I was really looking for good new music in the 80's and this supergroup was a huge disapointment. Avoid both Firm albums.
3,Classic 80's,"Two guys- Jimmy Page and Paul Rogers. Need I say more? If you enjoy classic 80's Rock and roll, you will like this album. Another not-so-easy to find cd. I think this sequel to ""The Firm"" is equally as good."
3,A few gems lost among rhinestones,"Noone is a bigger Paul Rodgers fan than I, but The Firm was definitely not a career highpoint for him. Still, this CD has 2 great songs - Dreaming, and Spirit of Love; and two good songs - All the Kings Horses, and Live in Peace (I should note, however, that the version of Live in Peace on Paul Rodgers' solo album Cut Loose is far superior to the rehashed version here. Believe it or not, even Paul's guitar solo had far more guts than Page's does here.) Most of the rest of these tracks sound awfully stale after just a few listens, primarily due to the overly methodical rhythm section, which seems to just plod along in soulless performances."
3,ok but these books don't stay fresh for long,ecspecialy with a program like Ableton where a new full update is released every year on the dot.I've bought many of these teach yourself a program books and most of them become very outdated not too long after you receive them. For some programs it's not the biggest deal but for some there are major changes in a version upgrade so the info in the older version book would be false at that point.
4,excellent book,"Barbara Tuchman won a pulitzer prize for this in depth examination of Stilwell's days in China. Her reward was well deserved, as it is a well written book."
5,Tuchman is the best,"While you are reading this, you are there. Somehow Tuchmanmanages to make all of her historical explorations very readable and personalto the reader, not a small feat considering her subject matter.Excellent."
3,lacking information,"most of the book is helpful and well illustrated.however, i needed information about calculating drapery pleats and the book says to use pleater tape. no help there. Also, i needed information about sewing a swag and jabot and this Singer sewing book tells me a no-sew method on throwing a swag over a curtain rod. no help there. the rest of the book seems to be well thought out. they surely missed badly on the 2 items I needed information about."
3,Bought as a gift,Didn't read but thumbed through. I actually bought this as a gift for my dad. He recommends this to anyone wanting a quick reference on sailing. Detailed enough to get any novice into the water.
5,A Masterful Work.,An exceptionally gifted lyricist and musician who rarely misses the mark. Encouraging to see that he has been studio-busy in recent times.
2,"Big lies, No Ties","James ""Quick"" Tillis portrays himself as the victim but the true victims are mentioned in the book. I read how he portrayed his wives, oh so many wives and he lied quite a bit. To add to this credit I met two of them of which happen to be very intelligent and successful women with lovely daughters. As I read this account I feel sorry for the fact that he cannot account his story accurately. I saw his fights and also watched him train. He was not an outstanding fighter because he continued to make excuses of which is evident in his book. Big lies about his fight and no ties to his children what a sad ending to a man with a very sad life and history. Muhammad Ali portrayal..I think not....Only a washed up fighter desperate to make a living any way that he can!!"
1,Falling apart bus,"This bus seems like a lot of fun on the box but when you open it you soon discover that it falls apart the shower never went on and my daughter and niece played with their's for about 2 min. before it fell into a million pieces. This was a sad, sad Santa gift that cost a lot more than it's worth."
1,"Do not buy, this toy doesn't stay together!","My 5 yr old daughter got this for Christmas. This toy is terrible.It is always falling apart. My daughter cries each time it ""breaks"". She takes very good care of her toys so it is so disappointing to see this toy continually fall apart. I am ready to throw it out!"
4,BARBIE BUS IS A HIT!,MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ASKED SANTA TO BRING THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.......SHE HAS PLAYED WITH IT NEARLY EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE....AND IT IS GOING ON 6 MOS NOW. ALL HER FRIENDS THAT COME OVER ENJOY PLAYING WITH IT.....THEY EVEN USE HER BROTHERS G.I. JOE'S TO DRIVE THE BUS! ALL THE ADULTS THAT COME OVER THINK IT IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST TOYS THEY HAVE SEEN....THEY ALL GET A GOOD LAUGH OUT OF SEEING HER PLAY WITH IT.
1,don't waste your money,"This is the worst toy ever!! Nothing will stay put together at all and the pieces are very flimsy. My daughter got very frustrated with this toy, and I got very tired of having to keep putting it back together!! I threw it away."
2,party bus,"not what expected for price- wheels drag and doesn't roll well, the couch doesn't stay folded under and things pop off easily, generally pretty flimsy compared to fact that mine from childhood in 70's is more sturdy still"
1,Barbie camper falls APART,"This item looked wonderful, however, the girls took it out and played with it for an hour. Within the hour any piece that attached to the camper fell apart. I reassembled them, but they fell right back apart. For the money, this item was definitely NOT worth it & it went back. I cannot imagine the condition it would be in if we kept it. The music that played at the jacuzzi tub also only played for 30 seconds or so and shut off."
3,"Great Toy, but...","My children (age 7 and 3 1/2) both love the Barbie Party Bus. However the bed breaks off easily and the door for the bathroom constantly comes off. The sofa/bed refuses to stay together. So, although they like it, they do become frustrated when the pieces come apart and its a nuisance constantly having to put the parts back together for them."
1,JUNK!,"I fell into the trap, and OK'd this for my daughter's Christmas list. I usually refuse most ""million piece assembly required"" items that Barbie has to offer, but she wanted it so badly. My brother came through with it, and I feel awful that he spent so much on such a load of junk. Nothing, and I mean nothing stays assembled on this thing. She is almost 6 years old, and knows how to play with toys gently, yet it STILL falls apart whenever either one of us touches it. Namely the bed/couch and the door to the computer/game board. I desperately wish I could take this back, I wouldn't even stiff someone by trying to sell it in a garage sale for a couple dollars. Don't waste your money."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas because she really wanted it. I was so diappointed with the quality of this toy. On Christmas day after I finally put everything together (which was a bit complicated)my daughter sat down to play with it and pieces starting falling off. I had to spend the whole day constantly putting back on the bathroom door, table and bed. Needless to say, I lost my patience with this toy on day one. This toy is so very cheaply made and not worth the money."
1,You don't really learn much,"You'll get more out of just reading the manual. This doesn't tell you how to use the camera settings to take great photos, it just tells you how to change some of the settings (and not all)."
5,Black Sabbath - Dehumanizer = A Forgotten Masterpiece!,"I remember buying this when it first came out! I had to give a few listens before i really got into it! I agree with some of the other comments! As far as the Dio/Sabbath albums...I like Dehumanizer better Mob Rules but still give the nod to Heaven And Hell! Dehumanizer still kicks some major ass! ""Master Of Insanity"" & ""I"" & ""Too Late"" are my favorites! If you missed out on this one back in the day....I Highly recommend this forgotten masterpiece!!"
2,Difficult to top Heaven and Hell...,"Imagine my excitement when I heard that Dio and Iommi (fastest guitar player ever) had reunited to form the legendary band which had given us ""Heaven and Hell"" and ""Mob Rule"". Unfortunately this album is far from reaching those peaks: Dio's voice has lost its power and its warmth, and Iommi's speed has diluted into a gargle of noise. To summarize it all: a huge disappointment!"
3,not that good compared to the other dio lead sabbath albums,"well this album certainly ain't no heaven and hell or mob rules.it is a damn good cd but there is just too many average or just plain bad songs on this cd.the excellent tracks are computer god,i,tv crimes.the average songs are after all{the dead},time machine,too late and buried alive.the weak songs are letters from earth,master of insanity and sins of the father.this is not by any means sabbath's best ,but still there is enough good quality tracks on here to give it a listen."
3,If you like VHS to DVD Transfers...,"I mostly grabbed this as it featured the late Bruno Lawrence, but the quality of this DVD is clearly a VHS to DVD transfer. For the price of this DVD, you would be better served buying a VHS copy and conducting your own VHS to DVD transfer."
1,review of taxcut standard,"I believe Taxcut is a poorly written program because it requires the individual to make the calculations (or enlist the aid of H&R; Block), rather than enable the computer to make the calculations.I volunteer to do taxes as a part of an AARP program every year. Part of my qualifications involves filling out practice tax returns. One of my practice tax returns involved an individual with a pension 1099R which she had paid into. These type of pensions require that I subtract a portion of her pension based on how long she had received her pension, her age, and other factors. Part of her pension would be taxed and part of it wouldn't. All the information I needed was provided. When I got to this portion of the tax, Taxcut stated that I need to figure the taxable amount and then it referred me to various IRS publications. I believe this should have been part of the program."
1,2005 version is nothing like 2004,"The software seized up and can't be closed when you tried to do the update - same thing if you tried to register.The program won't do capital gains and loses. I sold some mutual fund and it won't let me enter the capital loss.You can't complete your tax return unless you get the update.Going to their website didn't help either. Their link doesn't send you to a working page so you can't download the update.So you're stuk. Since my tax return is so simple, I'm gonna check around and see what other software is available."
1,Does not keep accurate time at all.,This watch does not keep accurate time. It loses 20 minutes everyday even on full charge. takes too long to charge and has to be in direct sunlight to charge.
4,Cayman Cowboys,Good story. I enjoyed this book a lot ! Would recommend it if you are into scuba diving and mysteries
2,The Sphinx says it stinks,"I bought this on the strength of three 5-star reviews and was disappointed. It's OK if you like glitzy Super Bowl half-time shows, but if you're seeking exposure to multicultural art, forget it: it's pure Hollywood."
2,Not worth $9.99,"I purchased this Kindle book on the strength of the reviews. Rats. I wish I wouldn't have. The story is good, the writing is fine, but this is not a thrilling book, an engrossing read, nor a suspenseful plot. It is just ok. I am glad that I only purchased the first in the series because I just do not think these books are worth $9.99. I wouldn't mind reading the sequels, but I do mind the price tag."
2,Take A Look,I am not too thrilled about this product. It is difficult to get it at the right angle for my son to see in the mirror when it is attached to the crib. Everytime he touches it the things closes together with the velcro tabs which make it impossible for him to see in the mirror. The ties that you attach it to the crib with are way too short. I sometimes just lay it flat when he is on his tummy so that he can see himself. It doesn't keep him entertained for long.
3,Great until Baby can reach and pull!,"This mirror was great for the first few months of my daughter's life, but now that she can reach and grab things, she has pulled it down on herself or scooted it away so she can't see the mirror anymore. It doesn't stand on its own very well; like I mentioned, it is easily pulled down and that orange rattle can hurt when it hits a tiny face! The sunshine that squeaks is useless-- it is even hard for me to push and squeak! I haven't tried tying it to the crib yet, but the ties seem awfully short. I'd say this is a fine mirror to start with but as your baby really wants to engage and touch things, this mirror is too easily pulled down and moved, especially when it's on the floor."
5,We love this toy!!,We bought this when our son was a newborn. He is now 7 months and still plays with the mirror. For the low price it is worth every penny!!
3,Colorful but nothing special,"This Sassy product caught my eye because of its colors when I was searching for something for my baby's crib during playtime. Me in the Mirror provides the reflective mirror and some cute and colorful attached toys around the border which spring off with velcro for easy play, but I found the toy did not stand or prop up in the crib, and if we tied it to the side my daughter could not really get to it. It's cute if you just want something inexpensive and bright for brief amusement, but it could really use a better anchor system so it stays put at baby's distance. The side opposite the mirror has a slot for you to insert a picture of family or of baby so they begin to recognize photos and this is a nice extra."
4,The most favorite toy of all!,"We bought this for our two month old son (who is now three months old) to encourage tummytime. He was immediately fascinated with himself in the mirror. The older he gets the more interested he becomes in all the colors and fun extras attached to the mirror itself...he is currently engrossed with the purple bird! Like others, I agree the mirror tips very easily when opened to stand on the floor. I put my husbands shoe on the base to anchor it! By far this is the favorite toy in our household...why buy a regular mirror when you get so much more in this one. We love it! This was absolutely the best toy we've bought so far."
1,"My kid loves the bathroom mirror, ignores this one.","This is a nice little mirror, and I do emphasize little. There's a lot of toys that line the outside, I guess to distract the child from the fact that the mirror is so small they can't see themselves very well if they move around. It's soft, and makes noises, but the base is too narrow and it falls over at the drop of a hat. Do what we did, get a mirror and glue it to the bottom of a door. Avoid this thing, given that they only pay attention to it for 10 minutes, anyway."
3,Just an ok crib mirror,"The quality of the mirror is just ok. Although my baby is entertained by mirror in general, he wasn't particularly entertained by this mirror. Maybe he just doesn't like the decoration around this mirror."
4,Average?,"Seems to be as described. One cat didn't care, another loved it. Not much else to be said, as not all cats react the same way to catnip."
2,catnip toy,"I got this for my bengal, he usually loves his catnip. He played briefly with it and never looked at it again. It could be a good toy for some cats just not mine."
4,Every cat I know has one of these,"This is a classic cat toy! It does get a little rough around the edges after some intense catnip-fueled play, but well worth the money."
3,squirrel catnip toy,My 3 month old cat that has tons of energy and loves to play wasn't too impressed with this toy. He played with it for a while but now only plays with it occasionally and only for a minute or two. He'd rather play with wadded up paper or his other toys. I tried putting fresh catnip into the sealable pouch but it didn't seem to make any difference. I guess it all depends on what a particular cat likes. I would think some cats would love this toy but for some reason my cat doesn't.
3,Our cats love it when it's filled with catnip,"When it's freshly filled with catnip, our cats love it -- they toss it all over the place. However, when the catnip has been inside the squirrel for more than 20 minutes, they couldn't even be bothered by the squirrel. So, it's definately the catnip they like and not the squirrel by itself."
3,Loved at first,"Cat loved it at first, but lost interest in two days. Was not a fault of the toy, but rather the interests of my cat. He is entertained by balls that roll when he whacks them around. I can wad a sheet of paper in a ball and he is happy."
2,Kong Catnip Cat Toy,"The toy itself seemed fine. It was the catnipthat came with it that they did not like. I thinkthat it was aged, very dry, and did not have thecomponents of fresh catnip. They turned theirnose up at it."
2,Great but be aware,"I buy lots of catnip toys to my 5-month kitten. She loves to wrestle with this squirrel, and was especially attracted to the tail. Unfortunately, the fabric the tail is made is very easily thorn so I ended up pulling the threads away from her mouth as she was eating all of them as cats do. Diarrhea would be least of the problems but this can cause obstruction as they are not degradable. I cut off the tail but it lost its charm. The shipping and service from the retailer was excellent."
2,Might as well be road kill,"Well I was excited by this toy since I know my 3 cats like both catnip and the little furry mice toys. I even had one cat who had stolen a stuffed pony and would carry it around the house. However I was disappointed that none of my cats showed any interest in the toy. I used one of the catnip tea bags that came with it and when I got no reaction form my cats I replaced that wit hloose catnip. I think the design is good, but alias none of my cats are interested in playing with it. So the toy sitso n the floor like road kill in the street. :)"
5,Excellent CD,"I was first introduced to Bad Company when I watched ""Scotland, PA,"" which is a modern-day twist on Macbeth that features quite a few Bad Company songs in the soundtrack. We bought 10 from 6 after seeing the movie and it quickly joined the handful of CD's that I've basically stolen from my father. 'Bad Company,' 'Can't Get Enough,' 'Shooting Star,' and 'Rock and Roll Fantasy,' are some of my favorites on here. I personally think that 'Rock Steady' should have been included as well. It's a little short, but it's a great CD for a loyal Bad Company fan, or someone who's just heard a few of their songs and wants to hear more of their music."
3,Will not work with basic set.,"Please note that this piece will not work with the basic set. My son saw it on the promotional video and really wanted the ""red tippy piece"". I purchased it for his birthday, but will have to order additional extensions to use it. You need the three extra long pieces of track to make it work. It is too bad that this is not clear in any of the descriptions. I believe it will work with ""twist and rail"" or ""rail"", but not with the ""basic set"". I'm having to spend more and more money to be able to use the special pieces. In general, Quadrilla is a very well-designed and fun toy, but costs a lot, and be careful that the pieces you purchase will work with your other sets."
4,Little Miss Dangerous,"I first heard this album when it came out in the mid-eighties and I noticed that it was something far different that what Ted had put out there in the past.The usual themes with the lyrics in ""High Heels in Motion"" and ""When Your Body Talks"" but the guitar work is much different than from any other Nugent album. You get some of the old licks, but I think I'm hearing the use of guitar ""toys"" on this one, something that Ted avoided in the past.My favorite tune has to be ""Painkiller"", fast moving and fun.This was very hard to find, It seems that this album after it's original release was swept away and concealed from the public. I'm glad I could finally find it."
1,Not a good buy,"I'm sorry I bought this book. Opening it was like walking back in time. I did not know how old it was until I had already bought the book. The how-to is OK but the decorating ideas (styles, colors) are old and dated."
2,Very old and dated,"I just saw this on amazon's list,and I'm amazed.I have this book, which I bought, like, in another lifetime. It is old and dated, and there are many better and newer books on the market. Use this book only if you want your home to look as if it was decorated a decade ago. Otherwise, buy a newer book with fresher colors and designs."
4,"Finally, help for the Home Decorating beginner!!!","Since hiring an interior design expert was totally outside the realm of possibility for my budget, I decided, with great trepidation, to tackle the monumentus job of redesigning my living room. Although I had read several ""Home Dec"" how to books, and had a little sewing experience, I was still overwhelmed and intimidated by the prospect of taking on even a slip cover. I was pleasantly suprised to discover Simplicity's Simply the Best Home Decorating Book. The book gave me some great ""simple"" ideas for my home that even I could accomplish successfully. I would recommend this book as a great reference manual for any novice to expert ""interior designer""."
3,Slippers,"I love the look of these slippers. I am bummed that the tag is sewn into the bottom of the slipper--it has itchy stiches and I can't get it out :( I think the back of the slipper is a little tight, it cuts in a little bit, but overall they are VERY warm and cozy."
3,"Entertaining, but surprisingly loud","This toy does what it says. You can make the balls spin inside the sphere in various ways. Figuring out how to get them spinning in different directions is fun, and potentially a little educational.What I hadn't realized is how loud this toy is. In an open-plan office, you can't use it without everyone standing up to see what is going on. You can't use it while you are on a phone call, it is too loud. When people come into my office, pick it up, and start spinning it, they are always shocked at how loud it is. And once you get the balls going, they take a while to settle down, so it is loud for at least 60 seconds.Good toy, but not a good office toy, just because it is loud."
3,Boys will be boys,"I give this only 3 stars because it's budget showed a little (like ""Clerks""), which is a big thing with me. But never mind. Where this one really shines is in its understanding of men, how they talk about sex and how their hearts too can be broken. Something a lot of ""romantic comedies"" forget -- though I wouldn't entirely call this a romantic comedy, as its hardly romantic.If you're in the mood for a good laugh, as well as great dialogue and acting from people you've never heard of (but will), and, oh, yes, a nice soundtrack, give this one a try."
4,The Handbook of the Navigator,I found this a facinating perspective which made a lot of sense to me. I was a bit annoyed about his explanations in bibical terms but he did this to help people relate to what he is saying and the result was a very easy read. Get ready to be inspired!
1,The Handbook of the Navigator,"The Handbook of the Navigator is beyond disappointing. It is a blatant sales pitch for Mr.Pepin's at home systems for sale. It is full of repetitive comments with no substance. It hints at sharing a meditation or process to increase an individuals higher consciousness. On page 24 it states: It (The Navigator) can help you find a path among the experiences in your life and will lead, at last, into an awakened state of consciousness."" The book is titled ""The Handbook of the Navigator"" which leads one to believe that it is going to teach or convey knowledge or steps to achieve a higher state of consciousness; it doesn't."
2,Limited Options,"Unfortunately most of us are stuck with either TurboTax or TaxCut! I switched to TaxCut this year from TurboTax. Last year I had to boot up in safe mode to install AND run TurboTax. So I thought I'd give TaxCut a try this year. Low and behold I got the dreaded 21% hang while trying to load the mmvdpro.swf file. I had to boot up into safe mode again this year to install TaxCut. However, I was able to run TaxCut from normal boot, so a little improvement.Once installed TaxCut imported my TurboTax file and everything seemed to work smoothly. As TurboTax did last year. I'm not sure what these companies are doing with their software builds as the Tax software are the only programs I have installation problems with.Now, I just have to wait until I get the latest TaxCut updates (due in mid Feb) to submit my return."
1,Going Back to Turbo Tax,"How can a product claiming to have ""all the forms you need to file Schedule C- sole proprietor/home-base business"" NOT have the capability to create a form W-2 or W-3??!!!"
1,Yet another empty box,"I finally got all my tax information and a free weekend to do my taxes. However, the (sealed) box contained only the free bonus DeductionPro CD. It didn't actually contain the CD for Taxcut Premium + State. Contacted Amazon.com, and got through to them very quickly. BUT, they reported that they couldn't help me. They gave me the number to the Taxcut folks (the number was a recording to call another number). So far, I have been on hold waiting for the Taxcut folks to answer for about 15 minutes. I have used Taxcut to do my taxes for many years now, and never had any problems before now. I doubt I will buy any more software from Amazon, as it would be much more convenient to drive to Bestbuy, Target, or Walmart and ask for a refund."
4,high strength,"My trailer hitch and ball mount were only rated at 5k lbs. This ball is rated more than twice that capacity (12k). In case you need the extra strength, this may be the ball you're looking for. Price at amazon for this item is comparable to that of walmart."
5,"Delicious, low calorie and healthy snack. Good price too!",I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.
5,Happy customer!,So happy to have found a product that is wholesome and good to eat. It is comforting to know that I can eat these cakes with virtually anything replacing many gluetin products that I am trying to avoid. Knowing that this product is high in fiber and low in calories means that I can eat it without worry or guilt. Thanks for a great product!
1,Bad,"A pop up toaster is a very simple device that has been around in its current form for nearly 100 years. It doesn't have many parts. In the past they were all but unbreakable. The Toastmaster is evidence of appliance de-evolution. The connection between the levers and the toasting cage---one of the most important of the toaster's few parts, is cheap, thin plastic that eventually breaks. The other lever on mine didn't break because the toaster burned out before it got the chance.While it worked the Toastmaster Cool Touch took far too much time to toast and never toasted anything evenly."
5,Fantastic deal for an amazing series,"To make this short, Baki the grappler is a great anime series mixed with brutal fights and well rounded fully fleshed out characters that really make the fights shine. The fighting styles of each character really differ from one another making each battle different and unique. The story pales in places but not enough to affect overall. For the price (which was about 20 bucks for me) it's simply unbeatable, it may lack story elements that other more deep anime shows contain but it more than makes up for it with great characters and amazing fights."
5,No problem setting up and played DVD that I couldn't play on old system,I bought this because I couldn't get to all the options on the newer DVD's like the interviews. Worked great! I thought I would have a problem setting it up because I had a lot of things hooked up to my TV but it was no problem! Great Buy!
5,The Pretty Committee Strikes Back,"The Pretty Committee Strikes Back is one of the best books I have ever read, and it is definetly my favorite in the series. I loved it so much, I couldn't put it down. I had to tear myself away. It picks up right where Invasion of The Boy Snatchers left off, and the outcomes are great. I was so happy to finally know what happened between Cam and Claire, Massie and Derrington. I also love that most of the book took place away from home on an overnight class trip. I loved the way it ended, and now I'm desperate for Dial L For Loser. I'll be first in line to buy it when it comes out this August!"
4,President's weekend extravanganza,"The girls finally have what they want, or... mostly what they want in this fifth installment in The Clique series. Claire is THIS close to kissing Cam, and she can't wait! Massie has Derrington wrapped around her finger, and the rest of the school watching!!!However, some people DON'T have what they want. Kristen is devastated when her parents tell her they can't afford the trip the school is taking for President's weekend when everyone ELSE is going, while Dylan's mom and their geography teacher are getting a little too close..."
5,AIR BUD - Greatest of All,"Not many sequels are a good as the first, but this is an exception. When Bud appears in his uniform you react much like if the band just started with a John Philip Sousa march. Bud makes you swell with good feelings. Like the first movie, the dog shots are real and not just special effects. You do not need to like football to be cheering. I find the only time ball games are a good spectator sport is when Air Bud is starring. But then I have a couple of golden retrievers and 10 other dogs. You don't need kids to love it."
3,A Golden DVD!,"Air Bud: Golden Receiver is a very good movie, and it is worth the money. The bad thing about the Special Edition is that it is not in Full Screen and the packaging may appear somewhat shriveled up. But I would still recommend this DVD to people of all ages."
4,Love the 80's,I owned this cassette tape when I was younger and wanted the cd. Two of Hearts is a little different than what I had on cassette but it is still good and I still enjoy listening to it.
3,No Barbra Streisan,We all nkow Stacey Q is not no Barbra Streisan but when did Barbra Streisan make a dance hit or a work out song? never. I would rather have a couch dance with Stacey Q songs than Barbra Streisan #1 hits.
4,One of the 80's best,"I loved this tape back in the late 80's, ESPECIALLY Dancing Nowhere! I would be cruisin' down Highland Ave in my mini truck to this and I have just ordered the cd so I can pump it out while cruisin in the 2000's!"
3,Decent..Newer stuff is much better.,"I see so many people downing her these days. But you know what? She sold many albums and had numerous fans. Her first album is a classic 80's piece. It is comforting to listen to and is great workout music. Her newer albums show her real talent, but this was a decent start."
1,Sad and frustraited,"I have owned this flash for less than a year now and it just stopped working, I didn't even get to use it very much before it decided to die on me. I thought it was just the battery, but sadly that didn't fix it...I loved this flash so much because it is so exciting to get my pictures back and not knowing what to expect. I would honestly buy one again knowing that it is junky but I am going to save the warranty card next time...who knows when next time is going to be though. Actually before I buy another one I think I am going to try and take it apart and see if I can figure out how to fix it :/ idk :( I'm really bummed that my stupid flash doesnt work anymore, i really feel like i just threw away 20 bucks."
2,Not as helpful as I hoped for,"As the parent of a gifted child (elementary age) I bought this book to gain some insights into how to help and be a better a parent for my gifted child. This book seemed to be a little thin on specific advice or tips in this area. Instead of really delving into one area with a thorough evaluation, the book provided me with only a ""scratch the surface"" feel for multiple gifted groups: Gifted Minority Boys, Underachieving Boys, Young Gifted Boys, Adult Gifted Men, etc.The other book I purchased, Helping Gifted Children Soar, was much more relevant for parents looking for help with their gifted child."
3,Really Haven't Had any Problems,"The general consensus on this toaster seems that it is pure junk, but that hasn't been my experience. I purchased it on sale for $9, and really its been exceptionally adequate for the last 3+ years. Ultimately, its a TOASTER. It won't do much to change your life outside of toasting your bread (I can't say I understand the need for $50 toasters). Bread goes in and comes out all toasty and warm, dark or light depending on the dial-- and for that I would gladly purchase it again. I do not cook pop tarts or strudels or bunt cakes or whatever in it, so I can't comment on any of those uses. But its given me no reason to dislike it. My only issue is that you cannot easily 'abort' your toasting by flipping the lever up-- you have to wait for it to finish."
1,I see the Artistry Now let me Barf!,"As a fairly serious cineast, I am most patient with many films. I sat through over 2 hours of this movie hoping that it would find a way to remedy its illogical plot. If this were a comedy, I would probably be able to suspend my disbelief longer. But comedy this certainly is not! Between the documentary-like camera handling (which leaves you dizzy) and the implausible premise (Bess' husband is paralyzed neck down and all he can think of is getting his wife laid by someone else? Hello?!?!?) I don't know who is dumber, Bess or her husband! Don't waste your time with this film unless you really are into a die-hard ""art to the death"" fan."
5,Wonderful!!!,"I don't write many reviews, but for this I almost feel a moral obligation (so as to induce producers and viewers to make more films like this available). I had never heard of ""Breaking the Waves"" before, but took a chance -- AND WON! Yes, it's tough and gritty at times, but not gratuitously. Beautifully done."
5,A Brilliant Film-One of the Best of the Nineties!,"Lars Von Trier's stunning film was one of the best of the Nineties, an extraordinary and intense cinematice experience. It's the kind of film Ingmar Bergman made in the Sixties. A challenging film exploring the Spiritial side. Emily Watson is incredible in a one of a kind role, she should have won the Oscar for Best Actress. Highly recommeded!"
3,Hit and Miss,Some decent stuff mixed in with some tinny pop crap. What I will keep on the iPod wasn't worth what i paid.
2,Will never buy this brand,"I bought this coffee maker last year. It only last for about 1 year. The white color is not good, not easy to clean."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this product after my 10 year old Mr. Coffee finally gave up the ghost. The low cost of the Toastmaster caught my eye. Unfortunately, even the low price is too expensive for this product. It took me 10 minutes just to figure out how to open the swing basket. The latch is strong enough so you think you're going to break the plastic just trying to open it. The pot is very difficult to get in and out when coffee is brewing and it spills everywhere when pouring anything over a half full pot. If you don't like grounds in your coffee, you will need to purchase cone filters, which are more expensive than standard filters. Finally, and this is my fault, I didn't notice that this brand doesn't have an automatic shut-off. I can't tell you the number of times I've forgotten to turn it off. I'm thoroughly disappointed with this purchase and will definitely spend the money to get a better product next time."
2,"If you don't mind spilling every time you pour, buy this...","The other reviewer had it right: every time you go to pour a cup, the carafe spills coffee on your counter and down the side of your cup. Ha, come on Toastmaster, people have been pouring things out of pots since the dawn of time--surely you can design a pot that doesn't spill every time you pour!You have to clean this machine more often b/c of the spills and it's a white machine. We have this machine at work (actually, the model WITH the auto shut-off--it's no better) and I curse it every time I use it. We have to lay paper towels in front of the machine for WHEN (not IF) it spills."
4,Reads like short stories and holds one's interest,"The authors help bring to life the lives of rulers of ancient Mexico. Stories are pieced together from artifacts, stelae, buildings at Tikal, Uaxactun, Piedras Negras, Chichen Itza, and other sites. Interesting and at times speculative, rich with the flavor and color of the Mayan aristocracy of times gone by."
2,Only for Americans,"This book is not worthless, but only Americans are likely to enjoy it. It's supposedly set in the north of England early in the twentieth century, but the constant americanisms in the language make it hard for a British reader to keep going. When I came to the pile of ""freshly ironed serviettes"", I couldn't keep a straight face any longer, and gave up!"
1,Brita SpaceSaver Lid Doesn't Stay On,"We've purchased Brita systems in the past, but the SpaceSaver doesn't stand up to the usual quality of Brita products. The lid doesn't fit properly. It shakes loose with the slightest movement. And there's no way to pour from the pitcher without spilling water everywhere. I wouldn't buy the SpaceSaver again ... it's badly designed. We've had many kitchen accidents with this product . . . and stopped using it altogether."
2,Tired of it already.,"I bought this pitcher for my family so they wouldn't have to spend so much money on buying bottled water every other day. The water tastes better then the chlorinated tap water by leaps and bounds, but the pitcher itself is garbage. Every time I get it out of the refrigerator, refill it or try to pour a glass the top pops off and spills water all over the place. Instead of saving money I had wasted it on this product. Frustrating!!! Before you buy any water pitcher, make sure it has a better lid on it."
1,Get a different model,"I have had a Britta pitcher for awhile. I love it, it makes my faucet water drinkable. I just got this space saver model and the spout is shaped weird, like a u so the water spills out all sides. I traded it for the Aqualux. The spout is v shaped and should work better. I hope the lid stays on better too."
2,Bad Lid design - Skip this model,"I have to agree with negative reviews regarding the lid. While it is possible to use it without spilling water, you have to be very careful to keep one hand on top of the lid while pouring. And sorry, that's just not acceptable to me. The lid doesn't snap in, it just rests on top of the pitcher, completely loose.I bought this after my old standard Brita pitcher finally wore out (after 10 years!). I didn't even think about checking reviews first. What could really be that bad about it? Well, it's pretty bad.I keep the lid fastened on with two strips of white, waterproof, bandage tape. Works fine, but you have to remove the tape when replacing filters. I'd like to see Brita offer a free replacement for us disgrutnled types. What were they thinking?"
4,Another Excellent B-movie!,"If you liked ""Big Trouble in Little China"" you'll love ""Brain-Smasher!""I saw this movie on HB0 many years ago, and watched it over and over again. To this day, I find myself longing for a couple of the songs I heard. Unfortunately, the studio that put this movie out has all but disappeared, and the vocalist who performed much of the music is now a naturalist and audio book recorder, with nary a CD for purchase.Brain Smasher is your usual Dice movie, although his character is much more subdued than say Ford Fairlane. This must have also been one of Teri Hatcher's first roles, before she became such an over-actor. She was actually quite good and very attractive in this film.I won't go into the plot, because, well, others already have. This movie appears to be coming out on DVD at the end of Jan. 2007 in the UK, so I hope they release it via DVD in the states soon.If you're looking for something different--quirky but fun--check out Brain Smasher."
1,Extremely bad VHS quality,"This VidMark VHS tape is extremely bad. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. The movie itself is great, it truly deserves to be put on DVD, so wen can enjoy this great action comedy in high quality."
1,Not usefull at all,Not much to say about this text book except this : don't buy it! I went through it and not only is it a difficult read but it is very cryptic... There are much better books and more useful around than this one.
5,Excellent PM reference for Managers,"Dr. Kerzner, in his classic style, discusses the cultures and methodologies emerging from the growing mission-critical need to service one's customers with high quality, low cost, just-in-time services. It is no secret that Project Management is at the heart of these cultures and methodologies. Multiple quotes from both field PMs and executive leaders provide a multi-faceted view of project management from all angles, how it is growing into a management style all it's own, and where it's headed into the future. The textbook format allows the reader the opportunity to review the material, which serves to reinforce his or her understanding of the content."
3,fooled me LOL,"My fault really, but a warning. I was looking to get my hands on just a pair of mounts for one of the project cars I have in the shop, Didn't need the trans mount for a Chevy since this project will have a trimec trans. When I did a quick search this mount popped up and I jumped on it. My fault, Never in a million years would I have considered that this was a price EACH... my screw up, and at the price each I can order the complete set including a trans mount from Jegs or Summit. Live and learn... I'll hang this one in my hall of shame in the shop with a caption for my buddies and car owners to read ""for the car with only one engine mount.""good mount, but come on, when is the last time you ran across any engine that only used/needed a single mount. LOL..."
3,school book,school book..enough said...I didnt read more than i had to but what i did read was entertaining. The book was not particularly reader friendly though.
3,Could have been 156 pages shorter,"I was somewhat anxious to receive this book, as the other reviews were so positive and encouraging. After reading the first three chapters, I was disappointed as to the repetitiveness of the writing style. I found myself speed-reading past all the unnecessary words to get to the point, to find out the techniques for positive change. Consequently I was not able to finish reading it. There are some helpful tips in chapter 3 about disarming the critic, but other than that, I couldn't tell you, as I didn't finish the book."
5,Self Esteem,Very interesting book with lots of good information and exercises to try at home. This book helps to define the various portions of self esteem and shows how to develop a healthier self image.
5,WHAT A HOOT,Not since Love and Death have I laughed so often or hard. It was nice to see Allen being funny throughout the entire film. The greek element was hysterical.
2,A Wooden Allen Bomb,"All the Greek Masks and Greek Chorus isn't going to make this movie less tasteless and ugly.How a porn star find happiness with a helicopter pilot...with a Greek Chorus?Really you wouldn't expect such tripe from Woody Allen.That he could drag so many down with himis just some sort of social contagion?Mira Sorvino actually does a good acting job as the porn queen hooker.Helena Bonham Cater plays to Gothic make up that makes her look like a B movie vampire.Since Woody Allen wrote and directed this bomb, he pretty much plays himself as usual? He just has regressed in his sense of humorto a more infantile stage maybe?I just didn't like this film at all."
1,Woddy Allen is bad BAD MAN,"This is BAD BAD movei! IT SO BAD that my tooths huyrt!!! Too much pain... I cannot speaks very well englich because MIGHTY APRODITYE is like MIGHTY LOBODOMY to my brainbs!! Avoid! avoid! aviod!! And plese rate my review ""very heplful"" so that EVERYONE reads HOW BAD Mr. Woody Alan is!!! THanks you and god Blesses!"
2,It's like pouring a can of clam chowder on your spaghetti,I really wanted to like this sauce but the Bar Harbor white clam sauce just didn't do the job. There were not enough clams in the sauce and the flavor was rather flat. It really tasted as if I had poured a can of white clam chowder on the pasta and served it up. We won't be buying this sauce again.
4,A WORTHWHILE READ,"Now this is more like a book should be coming from Mr. Halberstram (let's give him a deserved break for his many terrific works & simply say he was out to lunch when putting together ""Defining A Nation""). Teammates is a wonderful, touching story the subject of which, although simple & true, is a bit tricky to write about when trying to do so for the masses. Few writers could pull it all together so effectively as Mr. Halberstram does. A short read but a more than worthy read."
2,No Magic,"There's a good bit of information in this book. But I just did not perceive that the author effectively conveyed the ""magic"" that the story seemed to promise. I came away feeling like I had some more facts about these players but just none of the 'warm and fuzzy' that I expected."
2,Know what you're getting!,"Before purchasing any book of poems, one should have access to at least a small excerpt with which to judge if the writer's style is to the reader's taste. I'd like to provide that here, since Ms.Dumitrascu has few publications. And, when you google her name, you will mostly find her surprisingly scathing rage-letters to various poetry contests, but barely any poetry at all (in fact, I only found one, and am quite search-engine-savvy). In any case, Ms.Dumitrascu's style incorporates strong imagery, which works well in a few instances, but is nonessential or otherwise in excess on more than a few occasions.An excerpt from ""All the snow"":""Death knows surprisingly few virginsIt copulated with you and you were thereafter left pregnantWith a fetus called horror ""Self-published indeed..."
2,Product description misleading,"This product was purchased with the expressed intent to upload/download and update phone book, pictures, music and ringtones for the SamsungGleam SCH-U700. The product description promises all this for the gleam, the actual product cannot access anything but the telephone book. what a waste since you can get free software and a cable for $5 from another vendor rather than the price i paid from amazon."
4,Nice,"My daughter loved it. I do think it should come with the horse instead of having to buy it seperate, but other than that it's been great and been played with daily."
5,A golden gem!,"Despite the fact the elapsed years from the release of this text, it contains valuable information about the description of the senses in the man and its functioning: a passionate essay and exhaustive explorative analysis around a broad amount of involved topics in this fascinating and amazing knowledge area."
4,Thank You,"I read the book ""The Da Vinci Code"" and found it to be extremely disturbing. In fact I was furious after completing it. I kept saying ""Where lies the truth in this book""? Did someone jump of the train too soon? Then fortunately for me, a friend informed me that your book was being written. For that I say thank you. You do an excellent job of dispelling a number of innaccuracies while empowering the readers to validate the ""facts"". Though the Da Vinci Code is a work of FICTION, it is written in a fashion in which it may lead to the clouding of the senses! I half expected your book to be a ""preachy"" rhetoric but it was by far anything but. So my thanks goes out to you for putting a fresh perspective out there for readers to enjoy and to provoke thought so that they too will seek the TRUTH.Sincerely,Wm. Quinones"
2,Bleah,"These clocks have lots of features, but are inaccurate and have low quality. They can't stand much of a drop, and the magnet/clip/stand does none of those three functions well."
5,Versatile and very useful,"This is the best and most versatile timer I have seen. The four timers - three with memory - are ideal for simultaneously timing medicine, food, meditation, etc. Highly recommended."
3,"nice and loud, but confusing","I use a timer in the kitchen AND one for my job doing museum activites with kids. This timer does a lot--too much. It actually has 4 timers and a clock, which can be very confusing when you only need to time one activity and need to do it quickly. Also the timer that I owned had a minute button that stuck, meaning when I was setting a time, the minutes would roll aggravatingly higher and higher. Again, the numerous timers and their coordinating screens were also hard to find quickly.I did like the loud beep.One of the children at one of my presentations must have really liked the timer and walked off with it. I will replace it, but with a timer with a simpler design. Also, if you dropped the timer, the batteries would fall out, causing you to need to reset the memory. Arggh!"
2,It was great while it worked.,"This timer lasted a few years. The magnet is relatively strong, but it is quite possible to hit it by accident and have it fall off your fridge. When it finally died the timer made a weezing sound rather than the perky beeps it used to do.It was a pain to reset the date etc when the battery needed to be replaced, but these are the things you must do to have this feature.I do think this should have lasted longer. If it lasted longer I would have given it more stars, escalating according to the number of years it lasted."
1,Doesn't keep correct time,"This is the only digital clock I have ever had that cannot keep time. It runs significantly fast. Might be OK as a timer for short events (cookies), but no good as a clock."
2,Stopped Beeping,"The timer worked fine for about the first 6 months, although I'd have to hunt down the manual to figure out how to reset the stopwatch occasionally because it wasn't intuitive. But then it stopped beeping when time was up. I've tried changing the battery, checking the manual and website, even tried emailing Presto and no luck. A timer that doesn't make any sound doesn't do you much good!"
1,GOOD WHEN IT WORKED,"This is the second one that went bad on me.The first one the screen went blank and I changed the battery and it worked for another week.I liked the size and functions of the timer so I ordered another one.The screen went blank on the second one a lot faster than the first one. I checked the battery and it was good, so there must be a flaw in these units.I am going to look for a different kind, and so should you."
3,Overall good,"Works perfectly except for one problem: The magnet on the back isn't strong enough to hold the weight of itself on your fridge. Mine has to sit on top of the fridge/on the counter. It will fool you, and 'stick' to the fridge and seem solid at first, but if you leave it be, I'd bet you almost anything in a couple days, you'll have noticed it's slid down to the bottom of the fridge if you're lucky, or, perhaps the next time you're getting a glass of milk and shut the door, it'll fall to the floor - and if you're lucky in that case, only the battery will pop out.Otherwise, I love mine, even if I do have to keep it on the counter."
3,"Nice Features, Poor Quality","Bought this timer to replace one that we've had for years. My wife uses the timer for everything, including wakeup alarms, so she needs a durable timer. This Presto timer worked for about two days and then it locked up. After rebooting by pulling the battery it could not be set. A little disassembly indicated some poor quality solder joints on the wiring from the switches to the PC boards. The solder had bridged between the pads, so the buttons were no longer separate! A little cleaning between each solder joint and the timer works fine again. If you have the same symptoms, remove the battery. If you look into the battery compartment you can see the bottom of a circuit board. To the left, there are 6 connections right next to one another. Clean in between them carefully (I used a screwdriver made for eyeglasses) and it may fix your timer. I suspect the problems other people have had with the timer are due to failed or improper solder joints."
3,Good timer... Bad manufacturing,"This timer is designed well, but I would like to have one that actually WORKS. The first Presto 04212 Electronic Clock/Timer I purchased came with a faulty clock. The second one came with a faulty clip (the spring was not attached properly - usable, but still a reject). And unfortunately, Amazon does not allow a replacement of a replacement.This timer has functional buttons and is easy to use. If you get one that actually is made well, I would imagine that it would be very useful in the kitchen. The product isn't poorly made... Presto just needs to tighten up on their quality control. Make sure you check the clock, clip, and magnet out of the box."
4,Great for the price,"This timer does everything and more. Original, I had one of those regular timers with the windup dial, and loud ringing. After less then a year of use broke. This timer seems well made, and does more than I actually needed.However I would trust the magnet in back for supporting on the fridge. Does not seem like the glue will hold for too long."
4,nice little timer,well all i can say it works for me. i personally like the different time modes(there are four timer modes)its also durable. so I'll recommend it any body who just want a simple timer without much complication.oh one thing i don't like it that you have to press two buttons to reset the stopwatch
4,Good Timer,"This is a great timer as a timer goes with two (perhaps) faults. It is very well made and works flawlessly. The PERHAPS faults are:1. The buttons are hard to push [could be a plus] and a little slow to react, you must be deliberate in your pushing.2. While the magnet might SEEM weak, I feel the problem might be in the weight [although another plus if you are a glass half full person]. I think that if it was stronger than it would be harder to pull off and then a different fault. I put another magnetized doo-hickey under it so it slides onto each other and it's not hard to pull off. I would buy again if I EVER get used to fault 1."
4,Fix the programming buttons!,"As stated by Frances E. Weatherly ""Grandma Fran"" from Sunnyvale, CA in her 1 star review:""In no time the hate began as I had to push the buttons so hard to get them to work. Sometimes I pushed them sideways and more softly and eventually got what I wanted to came up. Then it hopped all around to the other items, like the date, time, hour, minutes, seconds. I had to push away to make it stop. The only thing that worked well was the clock.""For me, there has not yet been ""hate"", but definitely annoyance! I LOVE the timer; once you get it programmed it is a great timer and counts down or up just fine, but the buttons make it a pain to get it programmed correctly in the first place. Also, as mentioned by many other people, the magnet is WEAK!Other than those 2 main points, the timer is great, so 4 stars."
2,too confusing to use as a kitchen timer,"I hate to disagree with everyone who loves this timer, but even after a year of use we still tend to set it wrong. It really is not intuitive to use if you want a countdown for a cooking step. For example, just this morning we accidentally set the pasta cooking time to 13 hours. On the plus side, it is nice that it doesn't require a specialty battery."
5,Why buy another?,Time. Day. Date. Year. Stopwatch. Four independently programmable timers - all alarmed - easy to set. Loud alarm. Displays time in AM/PM format or military time. Can time up to 24 hours. Calendar goes to 2099. Magnetic. Can stand on your countertop or desktop. Can clip to your belt. Ultra cool looks and design (looks like stainless steel). Actually has a TWO YEAR warranty.Why consider or buy another? This is truly the only timer you will ever need. As long as you don't break it or wear it out.
1,Bad as a stop watch,"This Presto timer measures 2-1/2"" x 2-1/2"" with a spring clip in the back, which doubles as a back-stand. It features a clock with month/day/year and day-of-the-week displays, a count-down timer with 4 memories, with which one can time 4 separate events simultaneously, and a count-up stopwatch.I used this timer mainly in the count-up stopwatch mode. Used as such, it was awful, because the start/stop button didn't always work. Very often, I pressed the switch to start or to stop timing an event, only to find that the timer did not start or was still going. Needless to say, that spoiled the event."
4,Getting back to her usual form!,FINALLY! Ms. Ross is getting back to her usual form. There for awhile I was beginning to think someone else was writing her stories--happy to learn I was wrong. Southern Comforts by JoAnn Ross is a fun story that everyone who reads for the fun of it will enjoy. (Welcome Back Ms. Ross I've Missed You!)
3,About the very bad agonybooth.com recap of this movie,This was already pointed out somewhat in the discussion section below. Here is one such way the recap (review) by one Ryan Lohner was in error (there are other ways it was all messed up too). He states that Marie Jouvet had an inability to grasp the situation when she gets kidnapped. What in hell was Lohner talking about? Jouvet even asked her taxi driver-kidnapper if he realized he was committing kidnapping.
2,a strange mix of terrific and horrible,"As Genesis embraced commercial pop, they were capable of fine moments, and Invisble Touch has the best of those. The title track and Land of Coufusion have great momentum and melody. But Genesis also embraced the worst of the genre, making terribly sappy ballads like Tonight, Tonight, Tonight and the even-worse In Too Deep (the first at least had good drums toward the end). Domino is a flash of the brilliant lyric and melody writing that Tony Banks had during the earlier days of Genesis, and The Brazillian reminds one of the instrumental ending track Los Endos, but they're not enough to hide the fact that this Genesis traded musical ambition for big bucks long ago, and it's sad to see three incredible musicians stretch out so little on a record."
2,HORRIBLE,"I'm not giving two star because I'm a GENESIS purist. No. Please, just listen to the drums in this album !! They are awful, completely beyond any reasonable explanation, giving the fact tha Phil Collins really can play drums !!!! The title track is very good, the rest is crap in the style of ""ABACAB"". A disgrace to the band's music ( but not to their pockets !!! )"
4,"MOST SONGS A GOOD, A COUPLE ARE WEAK","Overall this album is pretty good, but it's not my favorite Genesis album. I think ""The Way We Walk, Vol.1"" is better. I don't like the songs ""The Brazilian"" and ""The Last Domino"", but ""Invisible Touch"", ""Tonight, Tonight"" and ""Land of Confusion"" are great. Also, ""Throwing It All Away"" is really good. Definitely worth getting, but not first choice."
3,Waiting rooms rejoice,"Not a total letdown in the least, that is if you already pre-file this in ""lesser-incarnation version"", the band actually eases into its plastic production and nails a few out of the radio station."
5,Best Genesis Cd,"This cd RULES ALL! I like industrial acts like Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Gravity Kills, Fear Factory, and Piss, but was amazed at this album. My Mom had the cassette, so i listened to it and loved it. The only song i didnt like were: Invisible Touch and Throwing It All Away, but the rest of the album ruled!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Doesn't toast all the way through, AND BROKE AFTER 2 USES! Had to return it. Don't bother with it. Buy something else."
2,toaster,Not happy with this toaster. The levers are not easy to manage. The heating elements do not put off enough heat to toast the bread. It must be on dark to toast most breads.
2,Could be a lot better,"The controls on this toaster do not seem to function correctly. To get a good toasting, you have to stand over it and check how the progress is coming along. One time it will not toast at all and then the second time with the same toast and setting, it will nearly burn it. I can live with it....I mean, this is just a toaster and what can one expect for the price.The other issue is the plug is attached to the front bottom of the toaster instead of being in the back where it belongs. To have it sitting out on the counter and to look okay, you have to run the cord under the toaster. The cord is too short as well.If you enjoy watching toast burn, this is the product for you."
3,good,"very good, very helpful, just wished that the explanations were a little easier to understand and follow."
1,Bad buy!,"I got this watch as a christmas gift last Dec. 2011, and I haven't wear it yet because I need to get the band shortened. But when i got it to the jeweler the battery died down and he tried to replace the battery but the watch won't work! So i send it to Victorinox to repair it since Amazon got only one month return guarantee if you don't like the watch or if it isn't working at all! Victorinox repair told me that there are lots of things to fix , not only the battery needs replacement but some other things!"
3,So-so,"Pretty good if you like this type of genre. If you like movies which would star and Brad Pitt and Angolina Jolie, then you'll like this book"
5,books in very good shape,"The books I purchased , dated in the mid-1950's, were in very good shape. They were certainly well taken care of."
4,atlas that is actually small enough to have around,"This is not the most thorough cross sectional atlas available. However, the smaller size of this book compared to other anatomy references is a bonus. This book's portable size makes it easily available when needed. Has nice MRI pics that are very useful when reading studies. It is still useful to have a larger atlas available when on call, but this one works for most studies. Good value."
1,defective Salad shooter,i have just returned a defective Presto Salad Shooter to you. The food chamber will not stay engaged with the mechanism which provides the electricity to the whole system. I am not only disappointed in the product but I am disappointed in your policy of not refunding the postage cost which was $8.95. In addition to this was the cost of returning the product. As you suggested I returned it by return receipt request which cost me $17.10 total being $26.05. A lot of money to get a refund of $55.00. Since this epasode I have knowledge that the Presto Company has stopped manufacturing this product because of this flaw.Betty Hallett
2,Frustrating,"It is low priced, I'll give it that.Otherwise it's the most frustrating device in our kitchen. Lots of loose fitting plastic that bends and gives and does anything but provide consistency. The whole reason I bought this was to make thinner slices than what I can do with a blade and that's probably the hardest thing to do with this device. The adjustment for thickness actually changes by itself after slicing a while and the adjustment plate bends and tilts causing the slice to be a different thicknesses. Since it's not tilted the meat tends to jam up pretty quick in the outlet so you have to stop and clear it: which causes things to fall out of alignment and adjustment."
3,Bread slicer,"I bought this slicer in order to cut my homemade bread with, and for that purpose it works okay. It's very light weight and you can easily take it apart for cleaning. This is also helpful for storage as it takes up much less space than one of the more expensive deli-type food slicers. My only complaint with this machine is that the part that slides back and forth wasn't really designed to accommodate a normal 1.5lb loaf of bread. When you try to slide it out far enough so the whole loaf fits next to the blade the moving plastic part gets caught on the side of the machine every time you slide it back towards the rotating blade. This is very annoying and makes the cutting process not smooth at all. But I guess for the price you can't expect more than that."
1,Had high hopes but . . .,I had really high hopes for this item but it's on its way back to Amazon now. The whole thing is pretty flimsy. Great idea to have it fold up but the blade isn't very sharp and doesn't turn fast enough to really be useful. I guess we'll have to keep looking.
3,does a decent job!,"The electric food slicer does a good job, but then we only use it as a bread slicer.The slices come out nice and even.The cons would be it's noisy , needs two to operate it smoothly because the slices keep getting stuck and it's a little difficult to clean.I suppose for the price it pretty much gets the job done :)"
5,Cutting Edge Durability & Awsome Customer Service,"This slicer is replacing an older model of the same line which has lasted for over 17 years, still working but having some wear and tear cracks.The slicer has several enhanced features such as a curved output shaft which organizes the sliced product as well as preventing the blade from becoming cloged.Amazon.com seller YourLowestPrice has offered nothing but a steller customer experiance..."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"On one hand, I really like the protection the Otterbox affords. I'm not a swimmer, but am a disgustingly profuse sweater when I work out and the case has served my iPod well. However, the headphone connection on the Otterbox seems to wear out over time producing poor sound quality (e.g. static, loss of sound on one side). I'm on my second case in about 14 months and am again experiencing the problem. The company was nice enough to replace my first Otterbox at no charge, but at this point I'm ready to look for a waterproof alternative."
2,Toaster works; plastic breaks,"The plastic is weak. We use this toaster pretty lightly, and it's in a place where it doesn't get moved around almost at all. The handle you depress to push down the bread (there's a name for this but I don't remember it) broke in a couple of months. KA replaced the toaster (good for them) BUT it didn't take long after the warranty cut off for the handle to break again, and the plastic foot at the bottom to break off. Their metal products are top rate, this plastic is terrible."
2,Crappy,Santa brought this item to my daughter for Chrismas and she was so excited to get it. She wanted it open as soon as she recieved it. When we finally got it open and everything all set up and read the instructions nothing that it said it did worked. The hair did not change color and the eyeshadow didn't come off. We tried even using ice cubes instead of the little curling iron thing that came with it. Still no luck. My daughter still plays with it but it is not her favorite toy.
2,Odd Film,"This was an odd film. The heroine is a little selfish and ends up being somewhat of a user. Both men who might be the baby's dad, are polar opposites and really only the African is likable. So basically you end up watching an odd tale where only one out of the 3 leads is even remotely likable. It was not a satisfying film as a romance however it was interesting and it wasn't a complete waste of 2 hours."
4,Very pleased with this purchase!,"I purchased two of these- one for our 5-year-old daughter's birthday, and one for our five-year-old niece. I was actually very surprised at how much stuff comes with them. Our daughter loves playing with hers, and it will come in very handy on long car trips. Everything stores nicely in the case, making it very portable. The only inconvenience was finding that we really needed to glue the magnets on the back on the dress to keep them from falling off. Otherwise, we are very happy with this product!"
4,You Want This,"Do you enjoy folklore? Are you interested in the Gullah people? Do you just want to read some spooky tales? If so, this is the book for you. Blue Roots explains how the Gullah got to SC and why they alone out all of black America have hung on to so much of their African culture. You will be chilled by stories of the dreaded plateye and the hag. You will read of Dr.Buzzard the greatest of the root doctors and how the High Sherrif of the Low Country brought him down. I especially appreciated the fact that the author showed a respect for the Gullah and their ways andmade no judgements.Kimberley Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men"
3,No Christina!!,"It was interesting to hear from Joan's other adopted daughter, Cindy, because I have never seen her speak publicly about her mother. Still, it is hard to think of Crawford as anyone but ""Mommie"". It was so sad during the last five or ten minutes of this tape when people are talking about Christina's ""vicious"" book and discrediting her. She was the victim, not the perpitrator, and her book, and interviews, express how genuine and sincere she is. Even when she went on talk shows promoting the book upon it's release, people would say ""No, Joan couldn't do that!"" and Christina would say ""I was THERE!"". I still believe her wholeheartedly.That aside, this biography was kind of boring. Except seeing Cindy (and not even that much), I didn't learn anything new. I would recommend the documentary that comes along with the ""Mildred Pierce"" DVD. Excellent!"
1,Complete Waste of Time!,"Do NOT subject yourself to this movie, unless you are in need of a good nap or want to tick off your worst enemy. It is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is a toss up between this and Highlander 2, for which one is Lambert's worst movie. Go watch Fortress or Highlander if you want to see a better film of Lambert's. This one is a huge hunk of junk."
1,Waste of Money,I like Christopher Lambert and have most of his films but this one was a total waste.To begin the sound was obviously dubbed in and done badly at that. Most of the actors were not speaking english and it showed. those who were did not have the sound track in synk with the dialouge.Second the story made little sense as it jumped around to much. I suppose if all you want is mindless action you might enjoy this but I prefer a good story with something to say. To this I say don't bother.
1,Awful,The costume was a total disaster. It didn't fit properly. The material was cheap and tore easily. The gloves were for the same arm. Just awful!
5,Very accurate thermometer but be careful of getting it wet,"I have a Sun Zip-O-Gage thermometer and am very impressed with its accuracy. On a recent cold day I compared it side-by-side to a Control Corporation Flip-Stick thermometer traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology and accurate to +/- 0.3 degrees Centigrade (ie. about a half degree Fahrenheit). The results in Fahrenheit are as follows:Flip-Stick: -0.3 degrees FZip-O-Gage: 0 degrees F (actually, half a hair below it)The Flip-Stick cost about $60. The Zip-O-Gage cost under $10.On the down side, however, the back of the Zip-O-Gage is not sealed. As a result, some liquid cleaner I was using to clean dirt off the unit leaked inside and stained the front of the temperature card. It doesn't affect the thermometer's operation or readability, but it does mar its appearance. So, be careful of getting the Zip-O-Gage wet. I wouldn't leave it exposed to the rain. Otherwise, a great little thermometer!"
4,Beautiful Puzzle,I got htis for my boyfriend for christmas with the thoughts he would put it together and we could frame it he was so excited about it becuase its the original staduium that i cant even get him to open the box and use it. He wants to save it as a collectable. Very impresent with the box though and the quality for the price.
3,You want violence and Gore...well here it its........,"Im not too crazy about these types of movies, but i did enjoy Hostel forwhat it was...like a comic book. But this film, is surely different.It mixes film and video..giving it a unequal look, it gives you gore +violence ..in a kind of sadistic way.These days, almost everthing goes....and the filmmakers know it.Good for a viewing or two."
4,Very fresh scent!,"I enjoy this scent very much, only downfall is I tended to have to spray a little bit more on me than i usually do other colognes! Although given the great price I paid for the size of the bottle, it doesn't bother me as much it would an expensive smaller bottle of a different fragrance!"
5,Hot!!!,"This book was so hot, I've read it more than once! The writing was excellent, the characters were fun and engaging. The plot line was completely believable and engaging. The sex scenes were incredibly erotic yet tastefully done. I would definitely recommend reading this author! I read this one and then got the other two books in the series! Looking forward to reading more, keep them coming!"
5,Worth the purchase!,"This album is absolutely, without doubt a great listen. David Foster offers hints of his style through his masterpieces in this self-titled album."
3,Actually 3 and a Half Stars - Very Funny!,"I have to disagree with the only other reviewer (at the time of this writing.) This is a really fun anime! And I actually was laughing out loud while watching it! The other reviewer said something to the effect of Americans not understanding the pop idol phenomenon. Hey, didn't that rock-pop phenomenon actually start in America? It has mutated in Japan, surely, in that country's own way, but not to the point where this simple, fun, silly parody would go over American's heads. And no, trust me, I watched it with a friend who hadn't seen much anime before and we were both laughing out loud at some points. It's not brilliant, mind you, but it's good light fun for some laughs. Enjoy!"
2,*Yawn* This one gets a 1.5-star rating from me.,"Well, a parody of anime and Japanese culture it is. A brilliant one it is not. (I make that note because I've seen marketing write-ups for this anime which claimed that it was a ""brilliant parody."") Nothing really stands out at all in this lackluster low-budget production of a forgettable too-cliche-even-for-a-parody storyline. Some jokes worked, but most failed to even draw a chuckle out of me. I'd give this one a one-and-a-half-star rating if I could. This one is probably best left for a rental when you and your buddies are having a drinking party with ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""-type chatter."
4,Classy Ragtime,"If you are one of those people who thinks ragtime was the music of turn of the century riff-raff, Bryan Wright will prove you wrong. This guy plays with an understated, classical touch that really elevates the genre.His thoughtful and at times dramatic rendition of ""Bethena"" really shows why Joplin subtitled it a ""concert waltz"" -as opposed to just a plain old ""waltz."" I also like Bryan Wright's interpretation of Muriel Pollock's ""Rooster Rag."" There are moments in this rag where I am reminded of the delicate passagework of a Chopin Nocturne. But he can also play with a lot of vim and vigor - like in the ""Thriller"" and the ""Maple Leaf Rag""- in which he displays some ""hot"" ragtime playing."
3,"Good shampoo, don't recommend buying on line","I've used Sebastian products for many years. They make great shampoos, however they are sometimes tough to find in stores. So I decided to try to shop for them on line. I found them at Amazon and bought them but during shipment the bottles leaked all over everything. While still useable, I don't recommend buying these products on line."
4,Not as good as other episodes,"Perhaps because the whale was so big, and they had a limited amount of time for the dissection, but I felt like this episode was not as thorough as other episodes of Inside natures Giants. They spent much more time discussing and showing live whales in the wild than discussing the physiology of the actual dissected whale. It was worth the $9 I spent, since my 9yr old son and I enjoyed watching it together, but I wish it had been a two hour episode."
1,A piece on ...,"I rented this movie based upon winning the Cannes film award in 1999. Surprisingly it has received many favorable reviews from critics. This movie fails on every level. Is it a whodonnit thriller? The cops couldn't find their way out of their own apartment. Is it a love story? No, it's not even a sex story. The pacing is purposefully slow, like a glacialy slow. 2001 is the classic movie for slow, and you ""get"" the point of it. This movie has no point to get. You don't envy any of the characters, or pity them, you don't care for them at all because they're all pathetic. This is the classic case of critics seeing too many movies. They tend to give high marks for films just for being different. This movie belongs on the... heap."
4,"Dated, but still a great resource!","As a mother who placed her child with a family for adoption, this book has helped me make some decisions on what kind of open adoption plan I want to have and how my child may feel about it later. I am a little disappointed that it's so dated and that most of the stories are from closed adoptions, but it has still been greatly reassuring for me to understand how my child may feel."
2,Muy sencillo,"Tengo un nivel medio en guitarra y compre este DVD pensando que me iba a ayudar en algo, pero lo que tiene es demasiado basico, tampoco seriviria para un principiante, realmente a mi no me gusto."
1,RIPOFF!!!!!,"I own the first edition and, by comparison, the number of entries in this new edition are noticeably reduced! I'm not basing this on the book's page count which is 50 pages shorter (and physically smaller, too!). I randomly compared entries and checked to see if the missing entries were somehow cross-referenced. Nope. They were just eliminated. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Buy the first edition (orange cover with ""Slang and Euphemism"" in bold red) if you can find it."
2,Not tough enough,I ordered a Booda Floppy Disc but received this product instead. It will fly fine and may hold up to gentle play but my labs tore a hole in it after only 4 days. The Booda Floppy Disc they had lasted about 5 years before these same labs demolished it. If you have a dog that is gentle with its toys then this product may work for you but if your dog likes to play rough do not bother.When I reported the mix-up to Amazon they immediately sent out the correct product. Thanks again to Amazon for outstanding customer service.
3,It's ok,"I don't regret buying it as I needed information on a weber carb that I have. The book covers a lot of different carbs so the information available per carb is limited and there is little to no tuning information. The rebuild information is a bit weak as well. The price, however, is excellent for the amount of information the book does have."
2,"It cut the carrots okay, but not the vegetables I eat","I am so disappointed with the salad shooter. After reading the glowing reviews I decided to order it as I love eating vetetables, but hate cutting them. It was great cutting the carrots, but the celery got stuck even though I peeled it first. I tried red pepper and the shooter sliced a few pieces and then the red pepper kept spinning in the blade instead of being cut nicely into the salad bowl. It is even worse with an onion. I am returning it for a refund."
4,our 2nd salad shooter,"Our original Salad Shooter finally wore out... they are handy gadgets, tho mostly we use them for just grating cheese. Unfortunately, even with the slightly new design, they are horribly noisy, and the little motor still has that 'new - is something burning' smell....."
5,Great gadget,This is our second Salad Shooter (we had the first for many years). It does a great job with cheese and carrots and many other things.
3,Shreds nicely but the slicing is way too thin,"I found that the shredder attachment does a fine job of shredding, although it shoots straight out the side so it needs to be angled down into the bowl where you want the shredded food to end up. The slicing attachment is useless, however. The slices are so thin it is more like shredding than slicing. The photo on the front of the box shows fairly thick slices but I do not get that to happen at all - they are paper thin so not very useful for that function."
4,Salad Shooter,"I got the Salad Shooter for my husband for Christmas. It works very well if the vegetables are crispy. I think the list of items that actually work is a bit generous. We tried lettuce and olives, both on the list, and turned turned out to be a mess. The same with tomatoes. I do really like the ease of cleaning."
4,Works better than my Kitchen-Aid shredder attachment,"I spent over $50 on the shredder attachment for my Kitchen-aid and was disappointed by how ineffective it was. The SaladShooter had pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it worked much better than the expensive attachment. I shred a lot of mozzarella, so I tried it out as soon as I got it. I shredded 4 pounds of mozz fairly quickly and the quality of the shred is good, very similar to the shredded that you get in the supermarket. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of how loud it is. It works well, but wow is it LOUD. Clean up is fairly easy and quick, too. It's a handy little gadget. Amazon is selling it here for $35, but I got mine from a seller on here for $18 (used/like new - which it was), which makes it that much more of a deal."
3,the noise was a problem,"I had one of these for about 10 years. While it did a great job grating cheese, it made a painful screeching noise - to the point that about half the time I couldn't bear to use it and would just grate by hand. (And I'm not particularly sensitive.) It made this noise right from the beginning; since no one else has complained, it seems possible that I had a bad unit. Recently, I bought a Delonghi DFG440 Cucina Food and Cheese Grater, which is beautifully quiet (but harder to clean than the saladshooter)."
2,salad shooter,I had a salad shooter before that was also a mixer. This salad shooter does not have as strong a motor as the other one did.Also the shooter on this model is alot shorter than the last one that I had. It works OK but is not as good.
3,This was a returned gift,"I got this for my mom, but then found out my dad was getting her one too. He had gotten her the exact same thing, and it seems to work alright for her."
5,Always wanted one!,We were looking around town for one of these & the closest thing we found was $80!! I'm so happy to get it at sucha great price!! Great for cheese!!!
3,Rather disappointed,"This unit is considerably smaller than expected. The ""hopper"" into which the food to be sliced is fed, will barely take two carrots side by side. Top opening is 2"" x 1 1/2"" tapering to 2"" x 1"". Works great on small jobs but wanted to use for large batches of soup etc.Guess I should have ordered the professional model."
4,Salad Shooter,"I use this product specifically to shred potatoes and make Potato Dumplings, and or, Hash Browns. This is a wonderful Product that makes the task much easier. It simply does the Job and cleanup is easy!"
5,La familia de Pascual Duarte,This edition of the classic novel written in post-Civil War Spain is intended for students who have mastered basic vocabulary. The novel is edited so that the lines of text are numbered. At the end of the novel are discussion questions for each chapter and a few questions that pertain to the work as a whole. The book concludes with a large section of vocabulary.Este clásico novelo escrito en la poste-Guerra civil España es pensado para estudiantes que han dominado el vocabulario básico. La novela es redactada para que las líneas de texto sean numeradas. La novela es seguida la discusión las preguntas para cada capítulo y unas pocas preguntas que pertenecen al trabajo en total. El libro concluye con una sección grande del vocabulario.
4,Un buen libro,Yo tuve que leer este libro para una clase de literatura espanola y me gusto mucho. Uno puede ver las condiciones de la gente en Espana durante esa epoca a traves de la vida de Pascual. Ademas es un buen libro y lo recomiendo a todos que tienen interes en la literatura y la cultura.
1,"Powerful, but very loud","I liked the fact this mixer has more power then many of the less expensive (under $20) models. However, it is very loud. I have a 5-speed Kitchen Aid and have used a variety of other hand mixers including Sunbeam and Braun. This one is much louder.Pros - the burst feature is very smooth; while in burst mode, the noise level was more tolerable.Cons - noise level and heavy to manage. (I did not find it ergonomic.)I bought this mixer as an inexpensive second mixer; I'll be returning it and purchasing the 3-speed Kitchen Aid."
3,"Adequate, but nothing special",This is a very ordinary standard mixer. Good for the price. The only thing I don't like is that there is no push button to detach the mixing blades. You just pull them out.
5,SO COOL!!!!!!MUST HAVE IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think it is really cool you know,like Yasmin looks so pretty!!! I am so going to totally buy it!!!!"
3,MAKING IT BIGGER,I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE THEM BIGGER LIKE THE BARBIE LIFE SIZE ONE'S SO US KIDS CAN PUT OUT FITS ON THEM AND NOT JUST BE ABLE TO DO THEIR HAIR BUT TO DRESS THEM UP . BY BRANDEE
2,Not really a historical mystery,"Set in 336 BC Greece, the author attempts to solve the mystery of who was behind the assasination of Philip of Macedon. There are many suspects, including his son, Alexander, all with viable motives.While the author has chosen an era that has yet to be explored by mystery writers, she allowed the results of her research to bog down the story. The mystery and characters became secondary to her history lesson.This is the first of a proposed series by Apostolou (pseudonym for P.C. Doherty) and let us hope that the author has gotten the desire to write historical fiction over with and the next in the series will be an addition to the mystery genre."
3,Live At The Royal Albert Hall,"This DVD while true to the great style the has made James Last, it lacks the greatness of other DVD's. Maybe this is because it was edited and the good parts left out. This being aside it is still a great DVD and well worth it."
1,Not The James Last I Know!,"A disappointment. Only 55 minutes of music. The first half sounds like heavy metal rock-n-roll. The audio is not the usual. The red spotlight(?)colors everything in a dark shade of red. Jumbo TV screen behind performers is very distracting. Audience participation: Three rows of ""cheer leaders"" in front of stage. If I had paid $100 for front row seats and all I saw was the back sides of these folks trying to be kids again ... I have all the earlier James Last videos and they were fun to watch over and over. This one I fast forwarded thru the first 11 tracks, too loud, too slow. Orange Blossom Special and the Polkas were up to past standards. Interview with James took up the rest of the 77-minute ""running time."" His accent made him very hard to understand. This was not a problem with the interviews on the earlier James Last tapes. I don't know if the $10 I paid for ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" was worth it."
3,It was ok if you've never heard a guided meditation cd before,"This is the second course of JAR's I have bought.The guidance at times is a bit vague and the benefit of doing whichever of the cds you choose for 30 days isnt really explained in practical terms. The word ""invite"" has to go! James has the concepts but needs to improve on the delivery. Playing with the etheric body is fun but whats it going to achieve?After listening to Paul Scheele's guided meditations for so long I now think I've been spoilt."
4,Impressed overall,"The overall purchase and delivery was great. It was timely and actually arrived before I expected it. The condition of the book was accurately described. The pages were a little dark from sitting around, but the seller of the book had already indicated that it suffered from a little ""shelf wear"". I am very pleased with the process and my product."
2,"liked it, didn't last","This is the first presto- wev'e had the others, they seem to last 3 years at most {disgusting}My husband loves the drip,and it is better, and stays hot longer,hours-- without the taste. We liked this best! However,6 months later!!!!!!!!!!!!, a screw fell out of the bottom, won't stay in, so wer'e expecting the bottom to fall off soon.Do we get another? I doubt it- We liked the hamilton beach the least-what to do!?"
5,So far so good,I love perked coffee and this little guy does a good job - it has a nice look and feel to it.
5,"Coffee drinkers, unite!","Back to percolators, back to flavor! This one is a keeper - be sure to add the ol' one-for-the-pot scoop, and prepare to enjoy!"
4,Best way to make your morning cup,I've been using this coffee percolator for about 2 weeks now and find it absolutely awesome. The coffee is ready quickly and comes out piping hot and strong. I don't use a filter (I use a conical burr grinder with coarse grain setting) as I find it takes away from the texture of the coffee. Takes a little getting use to and probably not as easy as a drip coffeemaker but it's worth it. Matter of fact I got rid of the boring old drip coffeemaker. I would recommend this product!
2,Don't buy it based on the rave reviews,"The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because it's attractive and brews coffee fast. However, the coffee does not taste like percolated coffee at all. And it takes 50% more coffee to get the same tasting coffee you'd get in any low grade coffee maker. On top of that, it's a hassle to clean all the parts every time you want to make a pot. Very disappointed!"
5,Presto Coffee Pot,We received our first Presto for a wedding gift in 1969. We have been using one ever since. For a very short time we tried a Mr. Coffee when they came out but did not like it. We want our coffee hot and to stay that way!
5,No grounds in coffee if you use the filters!!,I have to say after the first try the coffee came out wonderful. Love that it doubles as a thermos too so coffee stays nice and hot.I was concerned when I read about coffee grounds escaping into the coffee-- on first try I used the paper filters that came with it and I didn't experience this problem.My only recommendation would be to use 2 tablespoons coffee grounds per 6oz of filtered water.Thanks Presto!!
2,Good coffee-but dies before a year of use,Really enjoyed the taste of coffee made in the percolator but this was our second unit that failed in under a year.
5,Works great,"Very nice value for the price. Took it out of the box, rinsed it out, added fresh ground coffee and had great brew in just a few minutes. So much nicer than a drip coffee maker, and it stays nice and hot."
1,Not Worth The Money,"Worst tasting coffee I ever had, the pot looked like stainless steel but the grounds basket and the tube looks like it was made out of pig iron, very bad metal taste, tried all the suggestions not to wash just rinse it out still very rotten taste, I guess where it was made in China tells it all very low grade of steel.Went to Wal-Mart bought a twenty dollar Black and Decker drip and I'm back to good tasting coffee again !I would NOT recommend this coffee maker."
1,Greatly Disappointed,"Nice styling and stainless steel quality, but I was really disappointed with both the quantity and quality of the coffee brewed. Coffee was usually very weak, I don't think the coffee pot ever worked right despite reading and re-reading the directions and using different brands/grades of coffee. I tried it for a week and then returned it, after trying to drink too many cups of weak coffee. I am scratching my head at the 200+ rave reviews...."
4,Great coffee,This is a great percolator. It takes longer to perk than my older Farberware but I'm hoping it LASTS longer. It's nice and streamlined and easy to clean. I like it lots!
4,coffee perculator,I love coffee brewed in a perculator pot. I am very satisfied with the pot and the service thru Amazon.
3,Makes Great Coffee But Built Very Cheap,"The service from Amazon and the packaging is very good.My first week of using the perculator is good, it really makes great coffee.The item however is made very, very cheap. The metal is very thin and must be handled carefully or it will dent. I do not see this lasting more than a few years."
2,coffee maker,Unless the perk tube well is constantly cleaned the water will not perk to the top. It is not easy to clean the well. We did learn that the the pot can be cleaned using dish washer detergent.
2,Not a consistent brew,Sometimes the coffee is clear and watered down and sometimes it's perfect. I clean it and use the same amount of coffee. 3-4 tablespoons and 16 oz water. I can tell from the noise it's making and if steam is coming out whether it's going to be a good or bad round of coffee. A shame about these electric percolators. I had the same issue with my farberware. Going back to flameware stoptop for good.
3,don't leave coffee in percolator for an extend time; it burns,"works just fine, its what i wanted. however, I take coffee out and shut off percolator, using reheat on micorwave."
3,Small little percolator,I bought this percolator because of the reviews. Unfortunately it is very small. 6 cups it leaves grounds so I only make 4 cups at a time. The ground basket is very tiny and you will need smaller fingers to manage the filter in it. I do like the taste of the coffee. It is very hot and it doesn't seem to cause the coffee any bitterness if left - but then again it is small - 4 cups or actually 2 mug fulls. If I had the option I would return it and get a larger size.
2,Just wanting morning coffee!,"I received the Presto 02822 6-Cup Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator the first week in June. At times the coffee was weak, but l learned to adjust/increase the amount of grounded coffee beans to make it stronger. Also, wetting the dry grounds before starting the brew seem to help to make it stronger. On August 18th...about 6 weeks after purchase....the pot no longer worked. I don't know what is wrong but just doesn't work any more. I plan to call the 1-800-number on the box to see what can be done, but I don't have a coffee pot this morning."
4,Electric Percolator,"Percolator works very well and produces a full pot of coffee quickly. I am pleased with the product, but I think it is very overpriced."
3,Just your ordinary coffee pot,This is just an ordinary coffee pot. I will say that I was looking for a coffee pot that doesn't have aluminum or plastic and this fit the bill. It works just fine. Does not have the quality of my old GE pot but hopefully it will work longer than that pot. Do wish that it did not have the spout but had a direct pour from a lip at the top.
1,Don't Buy It- It's Junk!,"Don't buy this coffee maker it's junk.I bought mine about three months ago and it blew up tonight,it had been making crackling noises for a couple of days and finally sparked and blew a breaker.A bunn costs more but will last for years.I gave my daughter my bunn coffee pot,I'd used it for five years now I wish I'd have kept it.Don't waste your money on the presto coffeemaker."
5,Great for one,"This coffee maker is great for one person, makes fantastic coffee and keeps it HOT. Much better than a big drip maker and looks very nice on the counter."
1,defective,"bought one, worked 2 days then wouldn't perk, brown residue in pronged hole where you attach cord. returned for replacement. second one leaked coffee from the same hole. (don't know how it get's there, but it's true.) returned for refund. too few things are made with pride today."
3,So far so good,So far a 5 star. But the coffemakers are made in China. I have purchased others which seem to go right after warrantee.In the old days when they were made here. You would have to replace the cord. Well back with follow up. After 4yrs. the coffeemaker is no longer making coffee just light brown hot water. 3 stars now. I guess 4 yrs. Is not to bad. I am not sure what to replace it with.
4,Awesome,"I love the flavor of coffee from this perculator. The only drawback for me is that there is no on/off switch so it is easy to forget to unplug it when you're done. This would be a perfect product if it had a timer to set it before you get up in the morning. Otherwise, it's the best coffeemaker on the market."
4,Presto SS Coffee Maker,Came as advertised. Produces excellent coffee in just a few minutes.Pros: Fast. No carryover taste from reservoir or basket. Cleans up nicely.Cons: No external water level indicator.
5,"Fresh, Hot Coffee!","Makes really hot, fresh, and as strong as you want coffee. My only complaint is that the top is hard to remove."
2,The Supremes (Rock and Roll Hall of Famers),"This book is written for kids, making it way over priced for this type of book. There were several pictures I hadn't seen before, but not enough to make it worth paying the inflated price. Buy it used if you want to check it out, that's what I did. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
1,supremes-rock and roll hall of famers,I personally thought this book was way over priced when you consider it's length is 112 pages.Hard cover or not I thought it was not worth the wait.There are a few pictures I've never seen before but I would warn any supreme fans not to buy it.
5,For The President's Eyes Only,One of the best espionage novels I have ever read. I wish this author would write another novel of any kind. I would definately read it.
4,Nice design but too small,"This product has a great look to it and the top lip lifts right off giving easy access to clean, but is yet heavy enough not to get knocked off. It's simple and works great for mealworms but not for superworms. They need to produce a larger version because for me this is more of a nice heavy water dish as about 1/3 of the supers I put inside get out."
3,Does it's job but...,This product works well to start but the plastic does cheapen it. I wish it was all metal. Mine hasn't broken or cracked but I feel like I need to be very delicate with it.
1,"Once it is on, do not take it off!",The plastic threads were stripped after taking the unit off the faucet once! A very frustrating product! Do not buy!
1,Reason why I don't like.,"My brita screwed onto my faucet ok, but not well enough. It broke in 4 days, off of my faucet. Now i have a brita and a replacment filteration that is just sitting my drawer."
1,"3 tries, 3 failures","I went through three complete systems, assorted adapters, teflon tape and different washers and over $100 plus 6 hours of labor including trips to hardware store...and I gave up.Bottom line: TOO FEW THREADS on the plastic collar to adequately catch & attach to either the faucet or any given adapter. Brita even sent me a complimentary filter set and adapters. There is no way this unit could maintain a seal and stand up to any amount of stress or rotation. I would advise anyone to try another brand, get the pitcher, or bottled water. It was a frustrating waste of time, but Brita did offer to send me a free pitcher w/filters to compensate me for my loss."
1,"Poor quality, leaks often, tastes good","Length:: 0:41 MinsI'm so p... angry at this faucet I made a video to show how awful it is. I've had several over the years and they keep breaking for no apparent reason. When I bought the first one, I was worried about not being able to replace the battery. Not to worry, because they won't even last long enough for the battery to wear out! You can't even take it apart to fix it. I swore I would never buy this brand again. It is poorly constructed with cheap plastic. Instead, I bought the Culligan faucet filter. On the plus side, the water does taste good."
3,Not so durable...another plastic failure?,"Mine started leaking between where it attaches to the faucet and the main body of the filter, but it lasted about 8 months and did the job. Too bad that it's not constructed out of more durable materials as the sink gets hard and heavy use...there is a year warranty on the thing and this one is going back."
1,Good filter until it breaks in 2 months!,"I have owened 3 of these so far and every one has started leakingat the junction to the faucet! The leak is caused by a crack in theplastic part that holds the filter to the screw ring that threads onto the faucet. Since this has not been fixed in over a year I can only assume that brita doesn't care if their expensive filter breaks after only two months of use! Don't buy one it wont last! Perhaps if enough people complain they might fix it, but I have read several complaints just like mine going back a year. Like I said don't buy one it will just break on you."
2,Constantly Breaks,"I am not a fan of this model. The older versions that didnt have the lights but the indicator manually moved worked better.It seems every three months the light indicator stops working and then you have to buy a whole new system because you dont know if the filter is still working or not. Definitely poorly made. This is my 4th one of this model and I have had the same problem with all.For the plus side, it does provide great clean water and I do like that you can turn off the filter for when you wash dishes etc."
1,Go with a different company's filter,"Just as many others have said, this filter will start breaking down, with very little apparent signs of wear where you can actually fix it. We had our model for something approaching a year, but I routinely had to tighten it down, pray, tighten some more, and repeat. Even breathing on it would cause it to leak. We went with a Pur 1-click version currently being advertised, and it's been running like a charm. It also installed 10 times more easily."
1,At least they honor their warranty,"You will be lucky indeed if this product lasts a year before either it starts leaking or the aereater breaks off. I made a big mistake when I thought I would save money by buying a multi pack of replacement filters. I've ended up purchasing two additional faucet mounts just to use up the filters. On the positive side, Customer Service is very cooperative about sending replacement parts when it breaks in less than a year."
3,New Design Flawed,"I purchased the Brita faucet filter after my previous filter started to leak around the connector. The prior filter was over 2 years old. The replacement filter is a new design and I have to say does make it easier to select between filtered water and stream/spray. The bad news is the adapters for the faucet are now made of plastic with only a few threads. After about a week, my new unit just flew off the faucet. I reattached and a couple days later, the same thing. Frustrated, I contacted Brita about the issue. The service rep, Ashley, was extremely helpful and sent new metal adapters along with a new Brita filter which became stripped. The new adapters have more threads and provide a better connection. If they just packaged those adapters with the product, I would have rated this 5 stars."
1,Death Trap!,"I am a doctor in a large metro area. I bought Brita filters some months ago, thinking that the tap water needed to be filtered. This filter started growing mold and God-knows what else inside the housing. I had been having diarrhea and upset stomach for the last few weeks before I took this thing off the tap. I had no idea what was going on, until I took it apart. There was red mold and black mold all over the water flow area, inside and outside the housing. I couldn't believe it!! This filter is made for the third world where there are larvae and eggs in the water. There is chemical and bacterial contamination in the US. This thing does nothing for that. It is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I wrote to Brita, and have heard little else but party-line. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, OR ANYTHING LIKE IT. Drink distilled water like I do now. Or just drink tap water."
2,made to break,I was really happy for the first bit with this filter but then I should have read the reviews here before I bought. I'm not even finished the second filter (not even four months of owning) and this thing pops off repeatedly due to the shallow plastic threading on the tap mount having weakened to the point of no return. I have to gingerly turn the water on so I don't get a face full of water. really poorly made.
1,Unit would NOT fit Faucet,"I would love to know how well or awful this product works, BUT the $$%%## Thing would not fit on my faucet! Forget about those cheap plastic adaptors....they lasted about one good turn...I have an inside grooved faucet....so when these adapters gave up the ghost, I went to the hardware store and bought a metal one for an additional $3.59. The salesman told me that he had complaints about The Brita NOT fitting onto sink faucets, but why not give it a try...he also told me that I could bring it back if it did not work. Well It Didn't!! Shucks...!!! now I have to go and invest in a PUR I guess, since I do not want to buy individual plastic bottles any more...what a shame...I have used their pitcher system for years and enjoyed it."
1,Frustrating,"The first unit kept falling off the tap so I got a second one. The second unit kept falling off the tap. Duh. The connecting piece is plastic and the water pressure pushes it off the tap, stripping the plastic threads. Water Pik makes a sturdier tap unit. I've taken to filtering that through a Brita pitcher filter into a glass pitcher....well, it works!"
1,Like watching paint dry ....,"Drip, drip, drip. One drip at a time. It takes 20 minutes to fill a pasta pot. We've had it 3 years (it never worked any faster than this) and sometimes I'm just tempted to just use the tap water and not worry about lead poisoning from the pipes."
2,brita is a rip off,When the base and filter work its great that is if it works when you buy it that's 50% of the time or if it works after several months thats about 50% of the time.The base is supposed to be reusable well it is 50% of the time. The treads strip and the base needs to be replaced. What a shame because the 1/4 of the time your setup is working its fantastic.
2,This filter allows Poisonous Sodium Flouride Through!!!!,"This filter says allows beneficial ""Fluoride"" Through! In case you are still brainwashed Sodium Fluoride and the other Industrial Waste Fluorides they put in the water under the guise of ""Preventing Cavities"" Are actually Deadly Poisons that cause Cancer and cause you not to be capable of critical thinking!!! Hitler Fluoridated the Concentration camps! Just do the research!!! watch the ""Fluoride Deception"" on [...]! Also go to [...] to get the real news today and spread the word!!! God Bless :)"
3,It leaks.,"The biggest problem this filter has is that it leaks from the connections. If I tighten it too little, it leaks. If I tighten it too much, it leaks. If I tighten it just enough, the leak becomes bearable.It should not leak.Aesthetically speaking, the plastic look is cheap. Even the chrome version is still made of plastic and doesn't compare to the look of the metal faucet.These problems really show the type of people this product is intended for. Those that can't afford an under the sink filter.But all is not bad. The water from the filter tastes great."
3,Hot water issues,"If you run hot water through the filter -- which is inevitable as it is unavoidable in a busy kitchen, much as you may try to not to do so -- the indicator light will immediately start showing red, meaning the filter should be replaced. I have researched the situation to try to determine whether hot water damages the actual filter mechanism, or just damages the electronic sensor that keeps track of how much water has gone through the filter, but this information has proven elusive to me. My guess is that it is just the senor that is damaged, since the filtering mechanism is primarily charcoal and unlikely to be hurt by heat, and that it is probably still safe to use, but I can't be sure. In any case, it is annoying when the light turns red on a nearly new filter."
1,Poor quality leaks after a few months,"Holy cow!! This thing worked fine for a while then the switch for the filter started getting really tight. A week later it started leaking from every possible seam. Out the back, the top, the sides. We've gone back to the pitcher until we can find a better one. Avoid this product!"
5,No adapters and no problem!,"I've been using a Brita Tap filter for over 2 years now and have never had any problems. I figured it was about time to replace the tap itself since it was getting dirty but after reading reviews I was a bit hesitant. Everyone seems to be having problems with it not staying on. Since I've never had this problem in the past, I figured the product has changed for the worse over the past few years. Not true!My faucet has external threads and this fit perfectly! It screws on tightly and shows no sign of failing or falling. I'm glad I decided to purchase this item again. It seems that most people are having trouble with the adapters, and not the product itself. If your sink is like mine (external threads) and you do not need the adapters, then this is a great product!"
2,Not color safe,I tried this on my cotton blend sofa. I am so glad I tried it on spot that was not obvious because it took most of the color off. Maybe it would work better on polyester.
5,works as advertised....,worked well on my son's projectile vommiting all over the DH car. The other chemicals we had at home just did not touch it (e.g. Resolve).
2,A DVD of a 10 year old video,"I felt like I was back in sixth grade watching a film the teacher would put on when she needed time to grade papers!The picture was weak, grainy, and the sound lacking for a DVD. The information was OK. If you want to enjoy the sounds and sights of Yellowstone in your home, spend your time and money elsewhere."
5,We BOTH love this book!,"When the child loves the story, and the Mom loves the math lesson, you know you've got a winner! I highly recommend this book for elementary age students learning multiplication!"
2,It was too much ALL THAT,"The story started out okay; mind you not great, just okay, and then it went downhill. After a while it was all too confusing and too mundane -- almost silly at times. My suggestion is that you borrow this book from the library. That way you won't feel guilty about wasting money on a book you'll never read again or recommend to anyone else either."
5,Sheer Execellence,"The book came sooner than I expected. It was in great condition, and I was able to get all my work done. I would very much buy from this seller again."
4,Old school,"The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is the fact that compared to the production tools today, it stinks. At the time it crushed big time, but going back you hear a poor job of studio talent . Still a album for the ages."
4,Good for small spaces,"This unit is great for small areas like closets, utility rooms, small bathrooms, etc. As another reviewer mentioned, a larger unit is needed for medium to large sized rooms. I most recently used the unit in a hallway, just outside of the room where the cat's litter box is located, to keep any odor from drifting to the rest of the house, and it worked very well. The filters always seemed to last longer than I expected them to, so I really feel that I get my money's worth.*The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester."
4,The Tenant,"polanski films should be watched chronologically. the tenant stars polanski and documents his ascent into madness. after taking the flat of a girl who committed suicide, polanski, due to his own isolation and psychosis, begins to question his own sanity and blames it on everone else. the beauty here is that the film never allows the audience know what is real and what is concocted until its climax that, at first, resembles a comedy of errors, but develops into an incredily eerie disposition.i will have the galouises please, i don't care for marlboro either"
4,Strange Movie!,"This movie is very strange, it is one of the weirdest I have ever seen and I've seen lots! It is over the top!"
2,DVD Package...That's It?!?!?!?,"Great film, worthy of four stars, but...The DVD packaging is pathetic! Just a trailer! No image galleries, commentary, or lobby cards? Even a short essay on Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy"" would have been good!This is a rich, fascinating film which should have received better DVD treatment!!!"
2,"Interesting Horror Premise, But Moves Astonishingly Slowly","The Tenant is a film that wastes time and loses viewers. Long stretches of time where nothing happens, something quickly happens, then we are back to the monotonous pace - excruciating to watch. Never have I checked and checked to see how much of a film was left.The story sounds really good and gripping - tenant moves into the apartment of a woman who committed suicide. He feels something is going on with the building, the manager, and the other tenants. Slowly, he begins to identify with the dead girl. But the pace is so slow. The main character, played by Roman Polanski, is so boring and unsympathetic that you wish he would just jump out of the window and get it over with. He has a beautiful girl interested in him - why?The end - which I won't reveal - is absurd instead of unsettling, mainly because of the duration of time it took to get to that point."
3,Poor Design Connection,"The connections come screwed down so tight you can't get unscrewed. Very annoying because I know or at least believe if I could get it off the sound quality would be fine. I've had two of the exact same model before, both of which were shipped with the connections not so impossibly tight. Tried everything to get them off. Still giving them 3 stars because the previous two I had worked fine. Funny how they add an extra step to their production which inevitably just pisses customers off...save some money and cut out the part of the process where you screw them down this tight!"
5,Really works!,"I've tried out a lot of different carpet cleaners, given that I am somewhat klutzy and prone to spill things on my carpet. Out of everything that I have tried, I am the most impressed with this pre-treat solution, combined with the Bissell deep cleaner. I tried this out on three different stains: (1) dirt/grease; (2) blood (left over from cutting my foot); and (3) general dirt in a high-trafficked area. This pre-treat solution got rid of all of them. In fact, for stain #2, it disappeared even before I got to it with the deep cleaner.Because I live in an apartment, my carpets are not really high-quality, so I did not necessarily have high hopes for this product - or any product - as I think these carpets are made to be used up in a few years. Happy to say that this has made some of the carpet areas that previously had stains as good as the day that I moved in. Highly recommended product."
2,Unnecessary product,the smell is strong and bothers ones allergies. I dont think it is necessary to use in addition to the other Bissel products. I saw no difference in the stain removal by using this product. A big waste of money. Go straight to the Bissell products you put in the machine.
3,"Not sure this works as good as spray & wash, or Oxy spray!!","I have used this on dog urine , and little stains from people eating in my living room, and dropping food on my carpet.I have also used for the same little stains, spray & wash and Oxy clean.I have gotten the same results using all 3, there-fore, I cannot say this would be worth the money!Although I do love my Large Bissell carpet shampooer, and other Bissell shampoo cleaners.I have not used this as a pre-treat before using my large Bissell carpet cleaner."
3,Little disapointed in this product,I was a little disappointed with this product. It didn't really work for me and it should have. The results was unacceptable on minor dirt.
3,Early Bee Gees discofied,"Produced, arranged and conducted by Michael Zager of Let's All Chant fame, this 1979 album of Bee Gees covers include Holiday, Run To Me, Lonely Days, To Love Somebody, My World and Massachusetts. All of these songs predate the Gibb brothers' own disco phase; they are 1960s and 1970s songs from the golden age of pop. In Zager's capable hands, they became delightful dance numbers with rousing vocals. The vocalists are Alvin Fields, Stephanie Spruill, Julia Tillman and Lorna M Dillard. My favorites are Holiday, To Love Somebody and Massachusetts. This charming obscurity will probably never be released on CD but those who love disco music will find it most enjoyable.Michael Zager Dance CollectionDefinitive CollectionTheir Greatest Hits"
4,Use early in the college search,"This book contains very basic information and designed for parents and kids who don't really understand the college application process. One chapter is called, "" How to read a College Catalog"" 8th graders and Freshman students who are early in the college search would most benefit by reading this book. If your Ivy league material, I doubt you need this book.The book itself, is written in a straight forward, simple,clear and concise, many pages are checklists with bullet formating. My high school freshman daughter who was clueless about how to pick a college used the book as a guide. We found it helpful and worth the money."
3,Weed through nonsense to get to a few good songs,"I liked ""love will find you in the end"" more than any other song, so I bought the DVD. I saw it on an episode of 'weeds' and it spoke to me so I became a fan of Daniel. That said he's mostly been brainwashed by mom and television, not to mention his religion and psychological probs. Still I respect him and bought some merch. I hope he finds happiness but doubt he will."
2,Holmes hm1700,"This is a good humidifier while it lasted. It is loud,not whisper quiet. The plunger mechanism broke on the water tank after 2 years (Jap scrap)!!!"
2,LOUD,"This humidifier is too loud. I cannot bear it. The filters are hard find, too, which is how I am rationalizing replacing this horrible machine."
5,Worth every penny,"In all of the Robotech series, this is probably the best DVD of them all. Because it unravels the precious story of Robotech, and tells the fantastic beginning! Plenty of comic reliefs, great fights, drama, music, and even on this DVD spectacular; nothing has been changed! They've kept it as original as ""original"" means! Yes!!7 episodes of robotech wonder! If you just want one Robotech film, buy this one. Trust me, if you buy this one, it will NOT be your last.,"
1,Was hoping it would work alot longer than what it has....,I bought this smart mug only about 3 or 4 months ago and I can't set the temp. at what I want to so that it will stay at that temp. It heats the coffee but gets to hot the cup just has Lo on it and I am very upset with this I paid over $20.00 for this and would not buy another one. Target has something similar to this for $9.99 so I'll probably go purchase one of those. I want to try to send this back and get my money back or get another mug but I have to find all my paperwork that I got with this mug. I just wouldn't spend that kind of money on this item again and last only a couple months.....
3,"Works great, just don't get the outside wet.","The coffee mug works very well so long as the outside is kept dry. That means when you wash it only wash the inside!! ANY water on the control panel causes the LCD display to stop working. Once it gets dry again; 30 minutes in your car with the windows rolled up on a hot day will do; it works again. Given other reviews I've read, I would not leave it plugged in with no coffee in it either."
2,Too many birds,"The DVD had a few minutes of interesting information, but the rest of it would make it a good sleep aid. It just never really captured the essence of the Grand Canyon, but instead spent a lot of time with boring, stock footage of nature scenes. I wanted to understand the scope and scale of the Grand Canyon; the geology; and the history and impact of it. Unfortunately, this DVD only scraped the surface of that type of information."
4,Too many great natural wonders to cover in < hour!,"I always love David Attenborough as a narrator and the scenery is this is amazing. However, there is just too much to cover in under an hour. This should be an introductory video for an entire series. Still, this is a great video just to kick back and relax to. Let your eyes soak in some of the most astounding scenery our planet has to offer while Mr. Attenborough's dulcet voice soothes your frazzled mind."
2,Hoover detergents are much better,"Bissell detergents are fine, nothing special. Works ok at best. Seems to leave a residue, carpet is not particularly soft, smell is ok, not bad. Hoover detergent works much better for both my nylon and olefen carptet."
5,Great Smell and Stain Removal,When used with the Bissell spot remover it works great. The smell is pleasant and not too strong.
1,Another one who fell for the 3 pack Deal,I too should have read the reviews before ordering. I thought I had purchased a 3 pack as stated but only received one today. I have e-mailed the supplier. Now reading the reviews this looks like a common thing that this supplier does. Amazon should either correct their listing on their web site or drop them as a supplier. Wish me luck as I try to collect the other two bottles.
3,"If you liked the movie, you'll like the book!!!","Max collins has taken Robert Rodat's screenplay and novelised it in order to satisfy the eager fans of the movie. The book expands on the movie, helping to flesh out the characters and scenes but in the process Collins makes factual errors that will rankle historians rading the book. (ex. mislabeling the Divisional patches of the two Airborne divsions; stating the Second SS Panzer Regiment was in Normandy on June 13th) but for the general fan of the movie, this book will more than satisfy your craving for more of ""Saving Private Ryan""."
2,"Nah, go with the Movie!","Jeez in the movie the say the f word once and a while but give me a break. In the first 10 pages alone they must have said it 50 times. Its like the author wanted to squeeze in as many of them as he could. The battle scenes are poorly described boring you quickly. The book is rather lame too, the movie shows the true ""HORROR"" of war a hell of alot better. Go with the movie you won't be dissapointed...Hey Mr. Collins, Go to college and take a class called english. It might help."
5,Almost better then the movie,It took me 1 day to read this book! I was missing the scen where Mellish gets knifed to death. In the book he was shot.Here you get the explaination why Wade is not staying behind when they attack the MG-42 nest. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE OR NOT.
1,"1 star for the book, 5 stars for the movie!","I saw the film before to read the book. For me, the movie is the more beautifull that I ever see with the movie ""The Thin Red Line"". Tom Hanks is my favorite actor and, for me, Capt John H. Miller it's his better charactere because he's a sensitive man and in the same time a rude commandant how masq his impress.Like the movie is very good, I read the book but, for me, is a very bad book: Colins doesn't write any details and doesn't give any emotions in his text. he made a summary of the film and not a description!In conclusion: See the MOVIE and DON'T read the book. Write me if you have the same or another avis of me. @+ Mia"
2,Don't know yet...,"After testing out the projector only twice, the lightbulbs burned out. I haven't yet been able to find replacement bulbs. But, I'm hoping that when I find them, I can use it and it'll be worth the price!"
4,Interesting but not compelling,"Most of what was presented I already knew, so there were no surprises. It would have been a bit more interesting with a narrator who could have done a better job of holding my attention. However, for those unfamiliar with the many idiotic decisions made by Adolf Hitler before and during the course of WWII, there are many very interesting actions taken by him that makes one realize that the allies came very close to losing that war, especially in the beginning before the USA was forced to join the war, thanks to one of Hitler's foolish decisions."
4,Modern day B-Western,"I'm the dimwit that likes gunfire and chewing on electrical wires, so I liked this movie.It's like a modern version of the old B-westerns (low cost, simple plot, no famous faces)and was surprisingly enjoyable; the bad guys are really bad, the girl is really pretty, etc.The director does a good job building tension and keeps it moving. Good camera work.Though Ms. Mears does not play a drunk very well. Enjoy."
5,FUNKY AND SEXY!,"SHE'S AWSOME VERY PRETTY GO GET HER RIGHT NOW! THERES NOT ALOT 2 SAI ABOUT HER SINCE SHES REALI SIMPLE. ALL I CAN SAI IS THAT I LOVE HER CLOTHES,HAIR,MAKE UP AND OVERALL STYLE!!!HER HAIR IS REALLI SOFT."
3,Does not last long.,"This filter is certainly a good bang for the buck, but don't expect it to last more then a month. I'm on my second set right now, and what I noticed is that after 2 weeks the filter needs to be cleaned and flipped over. Then it's good for another 2 weeks and that's about it. Now, I do have hard water, so don't know how much better it will work for those who don't have the same issue. With that said, I just ordered 2 more, only because this is still a better deal then Holmes."
3,it is ok,It arrived as described. The product is as described. A piece of fiber filter with mesh around. Definitely over priced but I could not find any other brand or products cheaper beside crappy quality ones. $7 with sipping included is good price imo.
2,Disappointed customer,"The plastic housing for the replacement filter disintergrates when washed. When the filter dries, it becomes very hard. This is ineffective as the dial on the humidifier registers that this new replacement needs changing and this filter needs constant changing. The new extra replacement filters (2) that were purchased 6 weeks ago have almost doubled in price since that purchase. The humidifier should be sold with multiple filters and now becomes a bad investment. We do not recommend this purchase."
5,great stufff,"I originally ordered this from my dentist for $400 that included 4 tubes and my own tray that was made there. I used it for a week and the dentist recommended 2 hours for 1 week. I got great results and I would recommend this product. I do experience some sensitivity to the teeth while product is on teeth but its nothing major. Teeth are noticeably white! When I'm done with my tubes, I will definitely be ordering some more online. Also, dentist recommended doing the process over every 6 months. Good luck!!"
2,only 25% effective in whitening my teeth,I was reluctant to order this product based on the reviews on your website but thought I would try it because of the price. It was only 25% effective (if that) in whitening my teeth and that is after 2 1/2 weeks of applying it with forms that I had made at my dentist. I wouldn't order it again.
1,Wish there were less than 1 star ratings...,"Quite possibly the worst computer peripheral I have ever purchased, and I have bought worthless stuff before. Spend an extra $2 and get something that will shut when you put batteries in it."
4,It's a cheap alternative for those who mouse sparingly.,"I, like a few other people here, caught mine at Big Lots, but I snagged it on clearance for 5$. For that price? This is a damned good deal and a competent wireless mouse to boot. Anything over the normal Big Lots price of 13$ is probably pushing it. I use this occasionally in conjunction with my netbook (which has a mousing area the size of a gnat). At first, I thought it had tracking issues, but nope, my table was just too shiny. I moved it to a matte surface and it worked perfectly. It's very responsive and hasn't given me any problems. I love that it turns itself off after a minute or two when not in use, which saves the batteries.Long story short, I'd recommend this mouse to anyone who doesn't use one on a regular basis and is just looking for a cheap travel mouse or addition to their net/notebook. A backup, if you will."
2,Great Price.,"Price was great, only used it once. But it was a good manual when I needed it. Great for the not to detaled jobs/"
4,Slow slow shipping!,"Not much to review here, the belts were as advertised and work fine for my vacuum. The only problem I had was that the shipping from the seller took over a week for the belts to arrive."
2,Of little value,"This polemical book has done little or nothing towards its stated end: ""ending the byzantine schism"". That is because it presents only one side of the theological controversies, the Roman Catholic viewpoint. Little to no attempt to present the Eastern view of such matters as Papal primacy and infallibility and the dual procession of the Holy Spirit in any form other than that of simplistic caricature. The only possible value I see in this book is its reprinting of Thomas Aquinas' ""Contra Errorem Graecorum"" (""On the Error of the Greeks"") which is of historical value, and also may contribute to an appreciation of the narrow and dubious theological grounds on which such doctrines as the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son really rest."
1,Modern proof-texting,"If one wants a book which simply forwards a narrow opinion which in the ends has the stick of a personal adgenda then this book is for you.Just like a good fiction thriller ""based on a true story"", this book leads you into a false reality by propping up advantageous insight and history, justify's them with well selected proof-texts, ignores glaring holes and contrary facts, and then presents the conclusions as a professional work.For anyone who is looking for an honest and serious scholarly assesment, then they should keep looking."
4,Overkill,"This is a top quality product, but it was overkill for my needs. (It was a gift) My particular camera setup is really too small for this head. Additionally this head is rather bulky compared to a ball head, so portability is reduced. That said it performs beautifully with more features than most folks might ever use. It has been quite useful when I needed a steady and accurate shot. My only complaint about this head, other than the bulk, is that the release is not as easy as it could be. It took a lot of practice before I got the trick of quickly releasing the camera from the head. In the meantime I lost a few shots while fumbling to change lenses, batteries, etc."
1,Piece of crap,"The quick release on this head is poorly designed, suggest Manfrotto do something about it. I have so many gauges in my hand from trying to release it, and I have no confidence in it not releasing my camera falling, wish I would have returned this PoS."
4,Resnick + French = Learning,"I must say I wasn't aware fo the existence oif this book until I read their Quantum Physics title. This book is great to beginners in Physics and Engineering, especially if you choose to use it with another author like Halliday, Resnick & Krane, or Serway."
3,Comfort Zone,My spouse's fibromyalgia is relieved by massage. I wanted to get a little comfortable with some of the theory behind the moves and this book helped me. I will keep it as a reference as I learn to improve my massage skills.
3,Dead spider on the filter,"It was good to find a good brand filter for a good price. But it was disappointing to find a dead spider stuck on the surface of the filter. It was not too tough to get it off though it left a mark. Did not want to go into the hassle of returning and rebuying it from somewhere else, but it surely was not a good experience."
2,Robotech macross saga vol1 dvd collection,I haven't bought the set on dvd but i did rent it. Marcoss is one of my all time favorite shows. The only flaws I can see in this first dvd set( and probably the rest of the sets) is that carl macek and the people at adv did not take the time to fix degradation in the video quality(it looks like they dubbed this from vid tapes)and the high price. This series is also available from Animego in dubbed form with the original dialog(not carls) and the video quality is far superior( they went to japan for the original negatives) after video enhancing to restore it.
2,If I wanted a Chinese bootleg...,"Having a dynamic menu (vs. static) would be great if they knew how to create one! What's the point of having menu choices when the cursor is locked out and you have to wait for the recycle or press MENU to play then MENU again to call the intro/menu?The trip counters blow chunks! Sometimes the menu recycles, sometimes the first episode plays. Sometimes episodes autoplay one after the other; sometimes you get dumped to the menu. At the menu, sometimes the next episode is highlighted, sometimes the first. Heaven help you if you have a lowly APEX DVD! The boxes should be a hint since the first two sets of this seven part series are only differentiated by a large sticker on the shrink wrap."
4,Robotech is not the same as Macross,"There are a few people who have reviewed this collection badly because there is going to be a release of Macross soon. Robotech is not Macross. Given, this portion of Robotech uses the Macross animation, but the story is significantly different. If you loved Robotech as a kid, this is what you want. You might also enjoy Macross, but if you wait and get Macross expecting it to be what was on after school, then you'll be sorely disappointed."
5,Actually it is a four and a half... Why?,In my mind Robotech always gets a five star or plus but i couldnt get passed the crappy Dvd encoding. Yes true it is a luxuary to have the Saga in Dvd and it is a dream come true... But you cant blame me if i want a little extra from the DVD. The sound quality and the picture quality could be a little better than the regular TV quality. I think the encoding is the sole dislike i had over the dvds. The bonus DVD is superb and it means something extra for the ones like me who first watched Robotech dubbed in Turkish ( or other languages). The box is amazing (Yes i am talking about the cover) it would be foolish to buy the DVDS without the collectible box. It has a very good gravure of a Robotech plane on top... <Sweeeet :)> Just buy it ... Nothing more to say i guess.
2,UnXciting X-Men,"This DVD probably deserves a better rating than I'm actually giving it. It's just that the episodes are out of order with the tv series which is quite frustrating, and the episodes just aren't the best selection. Neither of the 2 part stories needed to be a 2 part story and they seemed to be stretched out. However, at least one of the episodes looks to the future and The Phoenix Saga. In fact, this DVD has episodes before The Phoenix Saga and one after The Phoenix Saga. Here's my recommendation: Go get The Phoenix Saga!"
4,Great selection but frustration!,"These were good episodes. My only complaint is that the two episodes out of past parts 1 and 2. Those episodes were also realeased in the legend of wolverine set. Why would they have two of the same episodes release in two sets. They should have all of the episodes out on DVD, selling seasons."
3,Not recommended,"The game itself may be fun, but it is so difficult to click on what you want. The software won't allow you to go instantly to the tile and click on it. You have to go in slow motion or else you pass the tile and end up 2"" past it. This causes finishing time to be extra long. I don't have that problem with my other games."
1,Chairs smell like wasp spray!!!,"I bought the chairs almost a year ago and since they arrived the chairs have a obnoxious smell of wasp spray, very potent, that take overcome a whole floor!!! I have tried everything to try and get rid of it febreeze, oils, sprays and it will not go away!!!! I have been almost a year!!!! The boxes smelled and the chairs. I had to get rid of them because I was getting severe headaches when I was around them."
3,Fragile,"I bought these chairs a little over a month ago, and was happy overall. Knowing that for this price, they won't be the best quality ever. They arrived on time, me and my hubby put them together fairly quickly. Directions were easy to use (but the tool was a disaster, so my hubby fastened all the screws with the one we had at home, that works better). Chairs don't look cheap or bad quality, they LOOK awesome, but unfortunately yesterday i put a FIRST scratch by just trying to slide a random plastic package. One of the corners of the plastic little box, made the damage SOOOO easily, (there was no force).So i was just hoping that it won't be that easy to ruin it, especially when children are going to use it.So, a little disapointed, and if you don't have a lot of trafic in the house, and if you are super gentle and careful, these will be great."
2,Really weird,"This book makes me wonder what the author was smoking when he wrote it. It is frustrating, confusing at times, and sometimes totally unrealistic. Some of the stories are okay, but some of them are just weird. This book frequently lost my attention."
1,bad cd...,"Bought it to have the radio edit that made this song famous; unfortunately! It is not on, nor is any of Yomanda's real voice, or synth bass! It is just some crap, put together to waste money..."
4,Handy Guide to Trails,"This book is a thin paperback that is perfect to carry along on a trip. It's a good guide to the Rails-to-Trails system in Florida, although the descriptions of the trails are not as detailed as in some other books. There are easy to use icons listing what facilities are available at each site, and overall descriptions of the trails with some details about points of interest."
1,It sucks,Amazon should pay you the $1.99 to see it. This not worth seeing. Couple had potential but didn't go any where.
4,Kinda disappointed on the black ones.,"I had previously owned a pair of flight gloves which had pretty much seen their fair share of wear and tear, and was greatly pleased with them. So when i went to replace them I thought it would be the same thing. I was wrong, the black colored gloves, while the same size, were not of identical fit. As such, the thumb of the glove gets caught very often in things due to its non-standard design.I ordered a sand colored pair at the same time (same size), and those were properly designed and fit well. Still the best shooting and all around general glove you can get, great in the cockpit to feel buttons through."
4,interesting but short (like capote),"This is a very interesting piece from 20/20. Unfortunately, it only runs about 12 minutes which makes it a bit pricey. Surely ABC has other Warhol footage that could be used to pad this to a more respectable length?"
2,No Spring System,"If you want the Enzian poles with Leki's Triple Spring System, better pass on this and buy the Enzian AS."
1,Not a tight fit,Filter sold by MoreQualityLessMoney is little shorter than original filter about 2mm. That means unfiltered air will escape... not good.
4,Helpful,I just started this so it's hard to write a review.. But it makes me think about things in a new way. I dig it.
1,A lot of writing,"A lot of writing and very little knowledge or input from the Author on the subject.. If you like writing, this is the book for you~!"
2,Midnight Blue the only track worthwhile.,"Midnight Blue is what I bought this CD for, and it remains in my opinion the only decent track. Never heard of the other tracks and they all sound alike. The price still makes it a good purchase, but definately don't pay top dollar for it."
3,Good just not great,Lou Gramm truly has the best rock voice out there. In my opinion however he should have stayed with a great thing when he had it. Although this CD is very good it just can't live up to the greatness he's known for while with Foreigner. At the price it's still worth the buy if your a fan just don't expect it to top his past glory.
3,Not a bad movie,I like Holly Hunter in this. Kieffer Sutherland is kind of a toad but he strikes me that way anyway. The story line is good I think and reasonably true to life.
1,Scant on Alzheimer's,Some history and lots of free-associating tangents about this terrible disease but not much useful information on the actual disease
3,INTERESTING LOOK AT A DREADFUL DISEASE,"Shenk takes an interesting look at Alzheimer's disease--a surprisingly philosphical one and one that places the disease more in the realm of a natural inevitability of human life. The historical perspective also provides for some provocative reading. The scientific and medical information on Alzheimer's disease is realtively thin as compared to other recent books on the subject (e.g. ""Decoding Darkness"" by Tanzi and Pollen), but overall the books provides a refreshing perspective on a terrible disease."
1,Poor Science-Sensational Writing,I was very disappointed by the shallow and limited coverage of Alzheimer disease research in this book--from what I know much of the material is wrong or outdated and no decent history of the research is provided. The book is also generally sensationalistic and more journalistic in style (not very literary and not very well written).
1,Not the same as my LP version!!!! BEWARE,"I purchased the cd after years of searching, because my 2lp set had some pops an scratches...I was screwed. The tunes I wanted were knocked off to conserve cd space, and one tune was substituted that wasn't even on the lp. SHAME ON YOU ATLANTIC!"
1,Doesn't start at Zero,"I dislike intensely rulers that don't start at zero. This one has about 1/8"" at either end before the measurements start. I guess this is just a lazy way of making rulers to low tolerances. The model it relaced ""R590-15 was exactly 15"" long and started and ended on the mark. Just can't see this with the picture, so I ordered it without knowing this."
5,Great,"I'm giving this as a gift. I bought two for my dogs and they were so cute, I bought two more for my girlfriend's babies. She is going to love them."
4,worse graphics than the originals... somehow.,"nastalgia alone merits this ""collector's series"" 4 stars. ...but... the graphics and colors of these classics has been mutilated by this port to the PC. also, there appears to be some serious graphics corruption during gameplay { have yet to see it during the opening or game title screens }. by this i mean ""dithering"" like you see in most 3D games, yes. i know this is 2D, and screen ""flickering""....of course i may just be a moron, in which case read someone elses review. : )"
5,AMAZING vocals from an underrated talent in pop music!,"Laura Branigan delivers the goods on ""Touch"", my all-time favorite LB album. ""Shattered Glass"" will have you singing along in no time, and her version of ""Power Of Love"" BLOWS AWAY Celine Dion's tame version. Check out this AMAZING cd from one of pop music's most underrated talents!"
3,Some Classical Pieces And Some Songs From The Era.,"I have not seen the film, but it's clear from the 3 classical tracks that it includes trauma, saddness, loss and a brief ray of hope at the end.The songs from the era include good stuff from Smokey Robinson, Merle Haggard's Okie From Muskogee, which is live, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding and The Rascals.All very professional, but the tone is mostly downbeat due to the classical input, which no doubt fits in well with the film."
4,a soundtrack that must be felt to be experienced,"After first hearing this soundtrack in my 11th grade drama class, it too me aback.It is an emotionally draining soundtrack to be sure. And the piece 'barnes shoots elias' is a taut nerve-racker. It speaks to innocence, savagery and humanity's struggle with its bestial potential. Kick ass!"
5,the platoon soundtrack is unique!,"i like the soundtrack because it is a mix of classical and oldies music!! And it reminds me of the sacrifices the people in vietnam made for our freedom which today is taken for granted.Sarah, age 14, Ontario"
3,Nothing Spectacular,"There really is nothing spectacular about this exfoliator and I thought there would be, due to the long list of skin helpers in it.It's gentle enough to use everyday, but for me, it's kind of a wimpy exfoliator.I really didn't notice a difference in my skin and I used it almost every day for a few weeks. It pretty much stayed the same, but, hey, at least I didn't break out!"
3,Good DVD,"I love Sweet Honey, and my almost 3 year-old daughter does too. She is fascinated by the woman who signs along with the songs. She likes some parts of this DVD, but it doesn't hold her attention as much as some of their other performances."
3,A Useful Collection,"This collection of 15 papers is written, with a few exceptions, primarily for an academic audience and to academic standards. Although it covers very similar territory to that in Sydänmaanlakka: An Intelligent Organization, it is much less approachable for the general managerial reader. On the other hand, the individual articles go into substantial depth, with a wealth of references. The collection will be valuable to Human Resource and Organizational Development practitioners.Some of the articles are by 'great names' in the field including:* Prahalad and Hamel on core competence* Leonard-Barton (Leonard) on the factory as a learning laboratory* Brown and Duguid on communities of practice* Isaacs on dialogue and organizational learning* Argyris on teaching smart people how to learn* Kolb on the process of experiential learning."
5,Awesome,"Although im a Evans guy now, i will always use remo when i feel like it and this head is one of the few i'll use from remo. when cranked, gives a nice pop that some drummers like me look for. i had a black suede snare side on the bottom and it came to life. its not coated so you cant be a heavy hitter i managed to put a hole in the top of it. but i think this head is very underrated because it gives such a great sound but no one talks about it. most remo users go with the coated ambassador and other snare heads. i recommend this head to any drummer that is a remo user and wants a different look to your snare head. its also single ply which allows the pop that ppl want"
1,Not worth your money!!!,"I purchased this snare head for my son. He used it 3 times and it got a hole in the top. I would NOT recommend these to anyone! Believe me, it was a complete waste of money. If I could give it a zero star, I would!"
4,Curious about architecture?,"I purchased this as a textbook, but after reading it cover-to-cover I would absolutely recommend it for the layperson with a curiousity about architecture. It explains in not-too-much detail the basic concepts of architecture, without overwhelming the reader with technical jargon (and for the little jargon that is included, there is a nice glossary in the back). I never thought an overview of the materials used to build structures through the last few centuries would be this interesting, nor a discussion of how important light actually is in a space. If you can find it for cheap, I say it would make a great gift for the adult or (even high schooler) with a budding interest in architecture!"
1,I want the time wasted on this book Back!,"So, appears the PC gestapo has learned to write and publish books. What we have here is someones interpertation of what Punk is to them. In No way is any of the music a focal point, inwhich it takes a back seat to a political message which only ends with ones personal gain. This book should of stayed a 6 page pamplet you quickly throw away ( one like christian organizations hand out, hint hint). This book does no good for punk and people who consider is a main part of there lives."
2,Weak,"Poorly written school paper resurfacing as a book. I love AK Press but they should tighten up their quality control. Extremely brief and limited, and fairly biased. The one redeeming part is the section on Queer Punk - this is almost never discussed specifically in books on punk, and I appreciate the inclusion."
2,Kim Little was Terriffic,"This was a mediocre, cheesy, Sci-Fi movie. Kim Little was the bright spot in this otherwise scifi movie of the week. I don't know where she came up with heraccent but it was believable and I think she makes the movie worth watching if you have nothing else to do."
1,OMG,This has got to be the worst movie made between the 20th and 21st centuries. OMG...the acting was so bad I was mezmerized...the southern accent attempted by one of the actresses was horrendously bad. This movie must go down in the annals of bad...VERY BAD....attempts at cinema. Who ever gave it a four star rating must have been paid well...or high.Waste of time and money and energy and effort and....etc etc
3,Great maps; dry text,"I really like the black outline maps in this book that have each country labeled. They are very clear and easy to read; and I can use them with my school kids.Otherwise, I would say this is a book for adults who are looking for some quick facts about each country. I find the text pretty dry; I could never read it aloud to my class, and I would never ask the kids to read the material themselves. They would quickly become so bored they would hate geography. I am keeping this as a reference book- mainly for the maps. I purchased it used for about a dime, and so I don't feel too bad about having it around. Geography is a huge topic; I think it would be hard to cover everything in one book in a way that would keep the reader's attention. But as a quick reference, it's fine."
1,don't waste your money,It worked for 2 days then the brush on the bottome came off and it's hard to put it back. It doesn't work without the brush so now it's just sitting in my garage. Just buy a broom and a dust pan.
1,Not worth the box it comes in,"I have wanted an inexpensive ""old-fashioned"" sweeper for quick cleanups around my carpeted dinig area. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. This sweeper starts expelling what it has JUST picked up very quickly, making it VERY frustrating! The weight is so light that it doen's work well unless you REALLY push down on it. I should have taken it back, but it has been a few months. I just need a heavier, better one!"
5,nifty little sweeper,"This sweeper works just great for my large area rug that the kids drop crumbs on. The rug is dark brown and shows every speck. Grabbing this sweeper is so much easier than hauling out the vacuum. For small jobs like kitchen patio carpet and kid carpet it's the answer. Great price, too."
2,Warrior's Woman,"This is really one of the worst books I have read written by Lindsey. It is silly. It's like a bad portrayal of a strong woman still being dominated by the big bad male. I have quit reading Lindsey's works. She used to be interesting. Then she got into too much abuse of women. Rapes, nasty men, etc. I can find something better to read."
2,Painfully dumb.,"This was one of the dumbest books I've read in a long time. The author introduces a supposedly ""kick ass"" (literally) heroine who's a member of her planet's security forces, who turns into a shrill, bitchy, pain-the-ass when she meets the first man who's ass she can't kick. I was disgusted as Tedra was at turns petulant child and hysterical ninny. I expected to dislike Challen because of his ""barbaric"" ways, but he actually turned out to be the mature adult in that relationship. I actually felt sorry for him.On top of that, the sci-fi aspects of this story were pretty pathetic. Tedra is from a plant in a completely different galaxy from ours, yet her speech is peculiarly American: she refers to ""humanoids,"" uses the terms ""babe"" and ""sweetcakes"" incessantly, among other things. Science fiction obviously is not this author's strong suit.In short, I struggled to finish this book. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent Read,"I love Johanna Lindsey and this book was no disappointment. It was a little different then Lindsey's usual, but I liked it all the same. Definately a 5 star read."
3,Warrior's Woman,I just couldn't get into this book. It bored me. Too much male/female testosterone/womens lib.... The sex wasn't even good. It is one of my few books I will not re-read.
5,"SECRET!!! Well, not so anymore.","Hey, peeps wanna know a secret? They're comin out with PONIES (ponies Ponies PONIES!!) for the Bratz 2 ride! Although, being a horse-owner and rider myself, how can they ride with the pumps? It's extremely unsafe."
3,Illuminating Insight into Steve McQueen,"LeMans was and is a great racing movie but the real insight of this book is into the character of Steve McQueen. You may judge for yourself; in my opinion he comes off as extremely insecure and childish beneath his famous ""cool""."
5,fantastic,"If your a fan of lemans the race or the movie , buy this for a indepth look behind the movie"
2,Conusmer Reports was wrong,As mentioned before I bought this because Conusmer Reports highly rated this. I was been less than one year and the tumbler has broken. Not to mention the floor/ carpet switch has been constanly falling off from the first week. I would stay clear of this and other hover brands of similar make as a $200 plus cleaner should last more than a few weeks.
2,Burned Out Motor,"I loved this vacuum (while it worked) because it picked up a lot more dirt and cat hair and I found it very easy and convenient to use the other tools and attachments. However... the vacuum is only two years old and yesterday it sparked and then started to smoke and filled the house with an awful smell. I've since done searches and found that an unreliable motor has plagued this vacuum, so I'm hesitant to buy another Hoover. I spent more on this vacuum than I had on my previous one and it lasted only a fraction of the life I got out of other vacuums."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!,"I guess we are one of the lucky ones that got to use this vacuum for a year before it died. Now it sits in our basement collecting dust because every time we use it, it starts making a horrible sound and smells like burning rubber. We have changed the belts several times and now we cannot use it longer than a few seconds before it starts smelling again. The brush also stopped turning. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM unless you have a few hundred dollars to throw in the trash can. I am now trying to figure out the best way to dispose of this useless piece of junk :("
3,U6439-900 Self-Propelled WindTunnel Ultra Upright Vacuum,"Althought happy, I am not totally satisfied with the 6439 Windtunnel. It came without the filter and I had to go buy one. However, I did call Hoover and they are supposedly sending me one, but so far I have not received it. They could not reimburse the $13.89 it cost to purchase one. Also, the self-propel switch will not stay in the lock position--constantly switches back. The vacuum is awesome in its pick up power, although the hose could definitely be longer when using the stair/upholstery tool. I think the value was great and the company fairly quick in shipping. I did not get back to them with my problem as I felt these are no doubt one time type purchases for them and they had no way to make it right. Also, the box was destroyed after I unpacked it. Thank you for the opportunity to air my thoughts. Let it be said that I truely believe in the Hoover products other than my 'little' small issue complaiint. Anne"
2,Poor longterm performance,"Splurged a couple years ago and bought a Windtunnel when my wife and I got tired of going through $100 Eureka and Hoovers.Very happy with it for the first year...good suction and the self-propel feature made vacuuming almost fun. Fast forward 3 years and numberous little parts are near/past end of life and performance/utility are quickly deteriorating.Vacuum is still working, but I'm shopping for a replacement. Overall disappointed that a $300 vacuum was not better built."
2,EXCELLENT SUCTION AND GOOD RETURN POLICY,As with so many others we fell for the Consumers Report #1 rating and purchased the U6439-900 in December of 2004. Today we negotiated with Hoover for a complete refund after the agitator brush and the self propel motor failed for the third time. It is an excellent machine (the best we tested) when it is running and I have very much enjoyed my dealings with Hoover Customer Service. But having the machine completely breakdown every three months is much too much! Strongly recommend against this model.
1,9 months and I'm looking for a replacement,"I too was bamboozeled by Consumer Reports. The brush and propulsion stopped working after only 4 months. The guy at the vacuum repair shop laughed and me and showed me all of the other Hoover self-propelled vacs that were in for the same repair. Then the plastic footstep that keeps the unit locked upright broke off, so now the vac lies on the floor between uses. It does clean great, when it works."
1,WARNING: DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM,"This is a very expensive vacuum whose performance does not justify the price. It goes through belts on a weekly basis. Every time a belt goes bad, the vacuum starts squealing loudly. The belts are too thin, so they stretch out after only a few uses. At $5 apiece, this problem is very expensive to fix. I talked to Hoover reps at length and they of course say they never get any complaints, and that I should take my vacuum to a repair shop. I know what the problem is -- poor engineering and bad belts -- and there's nothing a repair shop can do to fix that. Hoover refuses to stand behind its product.I WILL NEVER BUY A HOOVER VACUUM AGAIN."
2,Not Happy With this sweeper,"We have owned and used Hoovers for at least 18 years. We decided to spring and buy another one, since our 16 year old sweeper is beginning to tire a little. We purchased this Hoover Self-Propelled WindTunnel (ours has bag) and it is terrible. Just doesn't measure up to the old one in many ways, it is heavier, has belt problems, doesn't seems as easy to maneuver. We are returning it today."
3,Hoover vac,"I believe that this is a returned item. It works ok but some of the packing material, as mentioned in the owners manual, was missing."
3,Don't purchase this vacuum,"This vacuum is very heavy to use. The cord needs to be held out of the way to make sure you don't vacuum over it. Although it cleans carpets exceptionally well, it does not clean close to walls without using the hand held option. It does not clean hardwood floors as well as other vaccums i have previously use. I would not have purchased this vacuum had I known all of this and would return it if I could."
5,Hoover Vacuum,"This, quite frankly, is the best vacuum cleaner for the money. Save your money and buy this one instead of any of those bagless Dyson models. About the only thing it didn't do a goor job on was once when I spilled the contents of my paper shredder, a cross cut model, boy what a mess! I finally resorted to my Shop Vac."
4,Hoover U6439-900 review,Works great. Have a collie and it picks up her hairwith the only problem being it tends to get wrapped up in therotating brush.
1,Thank you for the warnings,My 18 yr old vacuum (Eureka canister) died and was going to replace it with this Hoover. Glad I decided to research on Amazon. I am very sorry so many people had bad experiences but thank you to all of you for writing about it - you have saved me from wasting $300....Question - so have you replaced your Hoover Self-Propelled Wind Tunnel with another model? Which one?
1,Hoover Wind Tunnel - Don't Waste Your Money,"We have had our Hoover Self-Propelled WindTunnel for 3 years, and have just thrown it in the trash and are going to buy something else. It worked fine for about the first year, and has been in the shop for repairs about every 3 months ever since. We have had the self-propel fixed a few times, the roller fixed a few times, belts replaced because of 'hot' smells, the carpet to bare floor switch fixed, and now the roller again doesn't work. Find something else to clean your floors with, and do your research. For over $200, I expect much more reliability."
1,This vacuum is garbage,"We have had the Hoover Windtunnel for about three years. Less than two months after we bought it, the belt broke. One year later, the upright lock function broke and we had to drag the vacuum (which is quite heavy) around the house. Now the suction power no longer works and the brush just spins dust around. I'm pissed I paid $300 for all this frustration.Thanks Hoover."
2,Consumer Reports got this one wrong!,"Like many others, I bought this because it came highly recommended by Consumer Reports. It worked great for a while, but after about a year the brush stopped spinning. I replaced the belt (twice!) but it still won't work. If I didn't read about so many others having similar problems, I would have guessed that I just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at Amazon, I see that this is not a model that anyone should buy, despite the high rating from Consumer Reports."
1,This one's a lemon - beware,"We agree completely with the other negative reviews. We have had this machine for less than a year. It's been back to be serviced twice and just today another piece broke off. It worked well at first, but the belt gave out after a few months and the adjustment switches break easily. Today (one week after getting it back from service) the switch went flying across the room without the thing being on - all I did was move it. Now I can't turn the brush off. The self-propel feature is fine at first, but now pulls unevenly, especially on hard floors.We were fooled by the Consumer review and tempted by the relatively low price. It looks like we have to start shopping again!"
3,"Epic, But Not Necessarily In a Good Way","Well, I give it only 3 stars for the determinedly epic tone in which it is written, which makes some of it crawl along at a pilgrim's pace. On a personal level, however, in the end it gets all five, because notwithstanding flaws, it still works on the heartstring level - and I do wish he would follow up on Paul and Dave and Kimberly in the lives they choose. One last quibble: what happens to Sharra?"
4,Arthurian Trilogy plus,"I thought this was a series about the legend of Arthur - but it's really much more. A complex story of love, hate, war that goes beyond the mortal realm to pit ultimate good and evil together; more about the characters search for their places in the worlds they live in - and how they discover themsleves and much more.It all comes together here!"
2,I read this in junior high.,"I read this book in junior high and though I loved it then, thinking back upon it I find it fairly simple, yet a step above most sci-fi fantasy creations. It aspires to the heights of Tolkein, but doesn't quite reach. Still, it is a fun read and interseting effort."
2,Poor Nancy,"Back in her early career I was madly in love with Nancy and couldn't wait for her to record her next record (no CD's then). She had the most dreamy, mellow voice that I had ever heard. Then later on she started screaming and I lost interest in her but when I saw that she had released this new CD I thought that I'd see what the intervening years had done to her style. Obviously, based upon this latest endeavor she needs the money but she better not rely on her past reputation to get her fans back. Poor Nancy - but I still love her memory!"
1,NO GOOD,"I bought this curling iron to replace an old one. I turned it on, left it to heat up for about 5 minutes, came back and nothing had happened. I didn't even bother returning it, just threw it out."
4,Good change of landscape for the Transfer,I really enjoyed this new sound from the Transfer when I first bought it as a cassette. A neat Latin sound.
4,Why pay $5.00 a cup when you can buy the syrup for $15?,"Got tired of paying so much for boba milk tea so I bought the syrup. Now I am making my own Boba milk tea. All it takes is a blender, syrup and milk and ice. Try it for yourself and save lots of money."
1,Another mediocre American remake.,"Sorry. But, the only thing remotely funny about this movie is the bizarre make-up job on Whoopie in her transformation to a man. I give credit to Whoopie for trying, but a bad script left her helpless. Dianne Weist is somewhat redeeming as her assistant. On the whole, you're better off renting the 1982 original French version with Michel Serrault... infinitely funnier."
1,Intellectual Scavenging and Hate Mongering,"First, let me get this out of the way. Sterling and Peggy Seagrave are not historians, they are journalists. They do not live in Japan, although they may have come here to visit. They do not read or speak Japanese, and they did not quote any Japanese-language resources.There are many wild accusations made in this book, including blistering attacks on Quakers and members of the US Republican party. Unfortunately, the documentation to back up these accusations is pretty weak, and it comes across as disingenuous. At times, this book smacks of outright prejudice, particularly the parts about Quakers.This book tries to pass itself off as a serious and probing investigation of the Japanese imperial family and US influence in Japan from Meiji through the post-war period...If you're interested in the Japanese imperial family, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan by Herbert Bix is an infinitely better way to spend your money. That book won a Pulitzer Prize..."
2,Not As Good As The Other Soundtracks,"This CD doesn't have as good of songs as the other Rocky soundtracks do. I enjoy listening to the instrumental songs from the other soundtracks way more than listening to the Rocky V CD. Rocky V is the worst of the Rocky movies. The song ""Measure of a Man"" is fair; I bought the CD because I liked that song. Some of the other songs aren't in the movie; they're just inspired by the movie."
4,Bobby Short is an Icon,"Bobby Short is an incredible artist and performer. He has been an staple in the NY City music and art scene for decades and this album demonstrates why he has gained such a loyal following. The story of Andy Razaf alone is a breathtaking story of accomplishment in spite of the numerous obstacles that were present during that period in history. This album is a dignified testimony to the wonderful, yet poignant music and compositions of Andy Razaf. Done masterfully well, as only Bobby Short could do it, each song is like a single diamond in a cluster-flawless and hypnotic in its beauty, grace and style. You will feel as if you have been transported to another time when you listen to the renditions presented here on this classic undertaking. Enjoy."
4,Review - The Inner Game of Golf,"I very much enjoyed this book. As a single digit handicap I find that the most common problem I encounter on a golf course is the interference I create through negative thoughts. When my mind and body are left free to perform without the creeping self-doubt, I tend to play very well. When I hit a poor shot, my negative thoughts begin to build upon themselves until I am a shadow of the player I can be.The ideas and drills presented in the book have helped me to ""stay in the moment"" on the course and have allowed me to let go of neagtive feelings immediately after a bad shot is hit. While I still have a lot of work to do, I know that I will be referring back to this book to improve my play on the most important part of the course, the nine inches between my ears!"
2,The former reviewers of this book must be his relatives,A terrible read. All these gimmicks with the golf swing. No non-technical book such as this is going to improve the way one looks at the game as you play it. Mr Galwey obviously plays golf like the boy President in the current White House--use the ole footwedge.
5,No more burns!,"The conair 1.25 Hot Brush curls and straightens my hair and the bristles keep the hot iron away from my skin, thus virtually eliminating burns. I was always burning my forehead with a conventional iron so this is really a big improvement."
3,"Good, but Not Best","This brush works as advertised, but I find it less satisfactory than either a curling iron or a hot air brush. There is no curl release as on a hot air brush, and each curl much be completely un-wound separately. For me, it's harder to keep the hair in place with this than with a regular curling iron. Just personal preferences, but this would be my third choice of the types of hair curlers available."
5,Hot Hair.,"The Instant heat hot brush, is worth every penny, that was spent on it. I have purchased this product before,it does everything, that it states. I would recommend this product."
4,Review of Conair Hot Brush,"Hot Brush works great. I still wish it was a little bigger, I think maybe 2"" would be good."
4,good performance,"It is working well, little slow warm up. But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have very short hair, but i was mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead of hot air brush."
3,Warning,"The other reviewer may use this for her classes, but if that's what any other potential buyer has in mind, then you should know that Disc 2, which has the better, faster beat, includes one foul, foul song by 2 Live Crew. Sorry, but a lot of women in my class bring their kids in, and including a song about how much the singer loves naked women shaking their ... and ...just doesn't work. That's the only song with that problem, but it makes the disc unusable. And Disc 1 is just too slow to work up a sweat to. If you don't mind the crudeness of the 2 Live Crew song for yourself, then Disc 2 is great to use for working out at home."
2,Where is the heart?,This video is about memorizing the steps. It does not really teach you how to dance the tango. And what's with the title of this video? Very confusing.
3,An historical look back in the recent history of Alaska,"The author has captured the man who is Etok and at the same time given us a look into politics in early Alaska statehood. Etok's intensity of feelings for his people and his land was powerful and unharnessed. This is demonstrated well here. Also, we get a look into both congressional and presidential politics of this era. This book is more than about this one man."
5,A Beautiful Book,"This is a beautiful book, great as a gift, and perfect as a coffee-table book because of its glossy photos and large dimensions. I wish there was a photo here because I love the jacket. Inside are ten informative chapters filled with whimsical photos that made we want to run out and buy an ivy plant. The chapters are ""Ivy and Its Mythology,"" ""Ivy in the Landscape,"" ""Ivies in the Garden: The Vertical Dimension,"" ""Ivies in the Garden: The Horizontal Dimension,"" ""Ivies in Containers,"" ""Ivy Topiary,"" ""Companions for Ivy,"" ""Ivy Indoors,"" ""Culitivation and Propagation,"" and ""The Ivy Chart."" It's a lovely book even if you have no intention of growing ivy."
5,A completely entertaining book...certainly not boring.,Previous reader/reviewers who claim this book is boring either have not read it or are just mindlessly defending the Christian Science Church. This book is a great read. I found it completely entertaining and enlightening. I highly recommend it!
1,Not a typical CS experience,"Christian Science is a religion that one must make their own. There are no rules about seeking medical attention or information as the author implies. Yes, the CS textbook is old. It was written in the 19th century with ideas pertinent to that era, but the ideas, the principles, are what is important in Christian Science. I lived a very happy and healthy Christian Science childhood. The experiences of extremists must not be used to color the perception of Christian Science or Christian Scientists in general."
1,Watch Larry King on Sept 30,"I think anyone who is truly interested in gaining a more objective view on Christian Science would benefit greatly by tuning in to Larry King Live on CNN on Thursday, Sept 30 or else read a transcript of the interview with Virginia Harris, Chairperson, Christian Science Board of Directors. The public deserves to hear the Christian Science Church's response to Fraser's new book."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT,WARRNING.... Do not buy this unit. I have ahd to send it back to JVC three times and they still won't send me a new one. The VCR tapes won't come out when you push eject. JVC service people won't refund shipping charges even when the unit is broken. I am out over 100.00 in shipping too. Don't buy anything JVC. BAD SERVICE.
2,Iffy gpu cooler,"If only the air current were reversed, this would be a great product. As is, in a closed case, the puppy does nothing. Looks cool tho."
2,Noisey Fan Card,"This card does a little to move air around, but makes a ton of noise on the highest setting (Think hair dryer).It should work for the application, its just loud at high speeds."
5,50 degree C drop in video card temperature,"I was having a problem with my computer locking up because my video card was overheating. The fan on my video card stops spinning because I think it's underpowered or the fan bearings are shot. I could have started replacing parts, but I decided to give this product a try first. The temperature monitoring software I use was showing 113 degrees before I installed this fan card, with the side off the computer. It now reads between 62 and 64 degrees with the side back on and I don't even have the speed turned all the way up. In my machine the fan card is above my video card and moves the air away from my video card. It might be more efficient to push the air down across the video card then to be drawn out by my case fan, but I don't care, a 50 degree drop and no more locking up. I'm good."
4,"Fan works great, lights are going out","It is worth a 4 because although the lights are dim and going out, after almost two years the fan is still working great. I did buy it for the function foremost and bonus that there was lights on it, so the fans are still functional."
2,POOR instructions,"The quality appears good, but the item did not work. I run win 7 and upon installing according to the VERY POOR instructions, my box locked up and I was forced to remove it. After that, no issues..."
3,Not the one on the picture,"I love conair beard trimmers i owned a black pair just like the ones shown on the picture that i had for about three years now and the blades finally dulled on me so i wanted to order another pair exactly like the ones i had before because they served me well for so long but when they arrived it was a totally different model thats silver, not a huge deal but when i order something i expect to get exactly what i ordered they need to update their picture to show exactly what you are getting instead of fooling me to thinking im getting one thing and recieve something else, other than that the clippers work well for now"
1,Not what was shown.,I returned this product because it was not the unit that was shown in the picture. The seller did refund my purchase amount and said they were changing the picture but as I write this the same picture is still displayed. I cannot rate the trimmer because I never used it.
4,"Great, simple trimmer","This thing does the job and does it well. Can't beat it at $15. If you just want something simple and easy to use for occasional beard trimming, this product is great. It uses batteries, so if you trim a lot then expect to change out the batteries once per month.Easy to handle, small enough to travel with, and has numerous trimming attachments. Very pleased. Not a 5 Star because of battery life."
5,BarbieLynne,"Loved, loved this book. Robyn has a knack showing unforgettable characters in unforgettable situations! Keep up the great work, I'm waiting for more books!"
4,blue skies,"Blue Skies by Robyn CarrNikki had gotten custody of their children when her ex husband, Drake died.She used to get gifts of aviation, like planes and things for it.Now she's relocated her family to Las Vegas, chief pilot of a new airline and her friends are joining her.Loved hearing the behind the scenes of the pilots and stewardesses and air marshals.Bit confusing keeping everybody straight as there are many crew and friends.Relationship troubles and joys with the parents and many others are in the book."
3,Love Robyn Carr books,Robyn Carr's Virgin River series are wonderful books. I also enjoyed this Blue Skies but does not compare to Virgin River series.
4,Details were spot on!,"If you were looking for another Virgin River story, this is not the book for you, but it is a great story anyway! I worked for a start-up many years ago, and this one really took me back! I'm not sure we had the office romance, but definitely the drama! Kinda made me miss those days (except for the LOOOONNNGG days, little sleep, fun with the FAA inspectors, and dusty, dirty records, lol).I really enjoyed this story, thanks Robyn, for taking me back to the ""good ol' days""!"
5,Robyn Carr is a must read..........,The book was so great I went on to order the whole Robyn Carr Virgin River series. They are real page turners and I love them. Thanks so much.....
2,Penn State Puzzle is old.,"This puzzle is a picture of the old Beaver Statium before additions were put on. I thought I was getting a puzzle of the current (2009) Beaver Stadium, so I was disappointed when I received it."
1,Terrible service,I have no idea what the product was like because the service from this shipper was horrendous! I was told various dates for shipping and arrival and then the product never arrived and I received an email from amazon.com saying that they had received this product damaged and would not be able to ship it to me. This was supposed to be a gift and it never arrived on time! I wouldn't use the company that ships this blow dryer.
5,Perfect for traveling overseas,"I knew that I needed a blow dryer that was dual voltage, so I did a lot a research. I went to several beauty supply stores to no avail. Then I went to Wal-mart and found this very inexpensive one and thought that would be great since it could blow up due to voltage issues in Italy anyway. This dryer worked great. It was super hot, and took care of me just like my more expensive one back home. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Handy travel hair dryer,"I gave it for stars because it is noisy. I didn't use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate. It's also handy if someone is in the bathroom and you can't use the hotel hair dryer. For the price, it's worth keeping one in my suitcase."
1,not as advertised,"Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer. It did not come with the concentrator. It's going back."
1,beware,You get what you pay for... it's in my trash can. I've never used one of these before and never will again.I got the thing so tangled in my hair and almost thought I was going to have to cut my hair at the scalp to get it out.This is for short hair only!!!
2,does not work well,This particular electric brush does not heat up enough and is not effective in smoothing and curling my hair. I have used this type of brush(all different brands) for over 20 years but this is not a good one.
2,You get what you pay for!!,I couldn't wait to receive my hot hair brush! As soon as I opened the package I was not happy. Its very cheaply made. Does not get hot enough to hold a curl. I thought that it being a Conair it would be better made but I guess theirs lows and highs to every brand.
2,Disappointed!,I used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again. BUT the teeth are falling out of mine - many on the bathroom floor with each use. It will soon be without teeth altogether and useless. Next time I'll pay more and hpoefully get a better product!!
4,Coco Exterior Door Mat,If you are looking for a Coco Exterior Door Mat this is one that's good quality and should hold-up for a number of years. It is heavy weight enough that windy days should not blow it away. Shipping and time arrival were very good!
1,Horrible!,"Whoever gave this product a good review may be trying to get everyone else to buy it so they won't be the only foolish ones. This product is horrible and should not be used even if it were given as a gift. Conair should be ashamed for making such a ridiculous and cheap product. Get a good curling iron PLEASE spend the extra money. This isn't even worth returning, it would cost more to send back. It got tangled in my hair to the point where I had to cut it off. Also very cheap plastic material, paper thin. Heats up right away, (wheres the on/off switch???) The world may never know!"
2,I Don't Want To Be Rich,"Rich people have too many problems. Anyway, this song sounds desperate. Extremely. Skip this and buy some lottery tickets."
5,For the Country Music Lover,"You will love songs like ""Redneck Girl"", ""Lovers live longer"", and ""Do you love as good as you look""!"
5,great listening,The Bellamy brothers provide delightful songs use word play in the songs and is easy on the ears. Good mix of songs upbeat to mellow. Great listening anytime.
5,"Heart felt, and Romantic- Two Thumbs Up... Way Up!","This book is so meaningfull. If you like tear jerkers, this is for you. It is so happy when it turns out that it was Nick after all- not a bad guy! It was so sad when they went their seperate ways, never going to see each other again... well, maybe it won't be that way after all, we'll just have to wait and see. It turns out that Jessica really did have a guardian angel after all."
4,Almost five stars,"This book is really good. It's one of the best in the Sweet Valley University series so far, focusing mainly on how Jessica deals with thinking her boyfriend, Nick Fox is dead. It has a brillant ending which is very sad, when Jessica finally meets her 'guardian angel.' It also shows how Elizabeth deals with her problems with Tom as well as with her sister's depression. It's very realistic with lots of plot strands woven through the book. There's just one thing that stops it getting five stars- Dana and Todd! Those two as a couple is just ridiculious. Todd should dump her as soon as possible and find someone better."
3,harder to blow,The safety whistle is a great whistle and the sound carries really well. The only problem I had with it is that it takes a bit more air to get any noise than a normal whistle. Otherwise it is great. I would just worry about being out of breathe when I needed it the most.
1,Requires strong lungs to hear anything. Seller unconcerned.,I would not recommend this whistle to anyone. It requires very strong lungs to get any sound out of it. The seller seemed to be unconcerned.
1,Another great series bites the dust,"The settlers series began as a great idea which empasized economic development rather than building a massive army to defeat your enemies...warfare is still a factor but the stronger economy always won...with this game the makers guessed that a new engine meant a better game...wrong .. I see many people praising the weather...ok so..? The point here is that the series which reached a golden age in Settlers III and IV took a steep dive with this one ..like someone else said..if you liked the old ones please spend your 29$+ s&h on some other more worthwhile title instead and if you've never played the Settlers series I recommend IV I guarantee you'll have much fun than you would with this POS ... I cant believe someone actually said ""Best game in the series to date"" ..how very wrong ;) anyways I hope the game goes back to its roots with the next one .. otherwise I will be a very dissapointed fan of the series :("
2,Difficult Read,"I may never be able to finish this book simply because of the non-standard and small font and ink that is not quite as dark as charcoal gray instead of black.If you are past a certain age or have vision that is compromised at all, get ready to add a lighted magnifier to the cost of this book or wait for the Kindle version."
1,A FAKE!!!!,The watch stopped working after a month and when I went to the shop I was told it was from china which revealed it's a fake!!!! what a rip off!
1,worst....guidebook.....ever.......,"horrible. as some have said, names are misused, images are confusing,greatly lacking in explanation. i've been banging my head against this thing for two and a half weeks and i give up. clunky workflow examples and frankly outdated pipeline. anyone interested in a book like this would do themselves a favor by checking out Gnomon Studios or Digital Tutors. they present more sophisticated and intuitive workflows. save your money and use the manual that came with your software as reference with the video guides available from the above mentioned companies. it'll save you from the inevitable ulcers Learning Maya 7 will cause. p.s. been using EIAS since '95. Not new to this game. hope the review helps."
1,leaks,"The quick-connects, plastic connectors that attach the PVC pipe to your under the sink pipes, are not high quality. The water pressure pushes them right off my copper pipes."
1,Poor reproduction of flesh tones with this cartridge,"I was unhappy with the results with the 'six color' printing that occurs when you swap this cartridge for the no. 94 (black) cartridge. I put this in my machine (HP6210) and printed a test on HP paper. I printed a second picture when a put the no. 94 cartridge back (in effect making it a 'four color' device, which is what you would normally have in the printer). The same picture looked better when printed with the four colors. Most notable were the flesh tones-MUCH more lifelike. I would hold off on spending $24 for one of these, primarily because the result is not worth it, but also because the manner which HP designs the ink set-up. It's kind of a nuisance to have to swap out the black cartridge, because if you forget to put it back, you'll end up with a very high cost-per-page for regular printing of documents."
1,Bad choice!!!!!!,The worst watch I ever had.... don't waste your money..... the water enter in the machine at 2 feet deep
3,It's too small!,"The device worked well. Heats up really hot and fast. The attachment and versatile are GREAT! You can do soo many different hairstlyes and only by one machine...BUT...3/4"" is TOO small!! =(My hair isn't that long, about shoulder length, but it ends up looking silly with mini spirals.If you like that look then I would recommend it.But if they made it in different sizes then it would be the GREATEST iron ever!!"
2,Berlitz makes better products,"I bought this set before going to Italy for the summer. Since it had 4cd's, 2 books and a dictionary, I assumed that it would be a great help to me in learning some Italian. But it wasn't. The presentation is not particularly orderly or succinct, and an entire section early on is devoted to how to say absurdly complicated things like ""I'm married, but my partner has just left me with our children"". And what I really wanted to learn was simply how to buy tickets, order food, and hold brief, polite conversations.If you'd like to get started learning Italian, I'd recommend Berlitz's ""Rush Hour Italian"" which does a good job of going over the basics and helping you remember them."
5,Love this book! Great Price!,This book is great! I am a pilates instructor and the book really helps break down the golfer and what to work on with a golfer when it comes to pilates.
5,great reliable flash,"This is a great, affordable, and reliable flash. The review above is correct about one thing however, it does devour batteries, but this is a small price to pay for an otherwise exceptional flash. Metering in my experience was fantastic and consistent. Build quality is not bad, in fact I thought it was comparable to a Canons 430 ex flash I had owned previously (made in germany is a perk). Would definitely recommend to anyone in the market as an alternative to nikon."
2,A hungry slow thing...,I was expecting so much more but... the truth is unless you buy the optional battery you better buy the Nikon SB-800.The Metz takes abou 5 sec. to recycle at 50mm/f8!4 NimH 2600ma batteries fully charged will last you to make 50 shots. (without the auxiliary flash)And I don't belive how can they make a top of class Flash without a PC connection.
3,"Filter Works, but not PureSource Filter","Filters arrived very quick. They were wrapped in bubble wrap, not box as pictured.Installed filter fine, it works, but we should be informed that the filter is notFrigidaire PureSource filter at all. Some people do not mind buying substitutes, just be honest. I should have known, because of the low price. It should state replacement filter for PureSource. Will I purchase again, probaly yes. I wouldn't be surprised if Frigidaire made these filters and just didn't code them for whatever reason."
3,open box,"So while I am confident the item inside the box is new, the box has been opened and it is unsettling. Not the most well built unit, clearly a low end cleaner. Getting it for $90 during the black Friday retailer greed time makes the low quality tolerable. I have very low expectation of any real life expectancy from this unit, but at the price I won’t be too upset."
2,Believe the bad reviews and complaints of receiving a refurb,"Bought this new, but looked like junk and it was DIRTY with hair, something greasy and soap residue. Believe the bad reviews of receiving someone's used unit. Come to think of it, I hope nobody gets the one I'm sending back. Caveat emptor :("
3,Hoover steamerVac,"This purchase was a Replacement for a previous Hoover. Unsure of the model but it had the roller floor brushes and lasted about four years with three family's using it.Haven't turn this on so far but it's cheap looking and smaller than the last one.I may find that works fine but I wish had checked it out locally before the purchaseMy bad.But the price was great. You get what you pay for,."
5,GREAT!,"This machine lives up to everything it was advertised to do!It's light=weight, easy to work with, and did a wonderful jobon our carpets."
1,Hoover should be ashamed,Would like to use this product but it arrived missing the three nuts listed on the instructions. I called the 800 number and was electronically directed to call another number. I left a message as directed and received no response. (4 days ago). I sent an email (three days ago) and have received no reponse. Hoover's customer service makes me doubt my purchase was a good one.
2,Not working after first use,After bringing it to home. It worked only one time properly. But after that it is not taking the Dirty water in Tank.
5,This machine really works!!!!!!,"I was very doubtful whether this machine would fix my heavily stained carpets. It had been over a year since they were cleaned professionally and were really dirty. This machine WORKS!!!!!! It takes a bit of going over the same areas numerous times, and refilling the tanks but it works wonders!My suggestion that I found very helpful was to go over the area 1st with cleaning solution provided, and throw a scoop of OXYCLEAN in with the detergent.Step 2 is to go over the area again this time with PLAIN mircrowaved or boiled hot water alone. No detergent is necessary the 2nd time, because the amount of dirty water will astonish you! If the water the 2nd time around is really black, as mine was, then you can go over the area again a 3rd time to pick up more dirt again using ONLY Hot water.I highly recommend this machine."
2,disappointed,"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with Clean Surge, F5914-900I received the steamvac in 3 days & was very happy. Started to shampoo the next day and discovered the brushes would not rotate. Carpets not very clean. After calling Hoover I was told to take it to Sears for repair. It is now in the shop.I sure hope this is not going to be a real lemon forever.This is my second SteamVac by Hoover. My first one I gave to my daughter after 6 years and it still works."
5,SteamVac,The product arrived well-packaged and with relatively easy assembly instructions. SteamVac lived up to expectations. Has good capacity for cleaning solution and dirty water so one is not having to stop frequently to refill or empty containers. Did a commendable job.
5,What a great machine for the price I paid!,"I had some reservations about buying this machine because some people complained about leaking, etc. I read enough positive reviews and thought the complainers had user error going on.I got it today, my eight year old son assembled it (it was that easy) and I cleaned most of our downstairs carpets this evening. Wow! I think of myself as a good housekeeper and it is so painful to see how dark the dirty water is. No leaking!This replaces my ten year old Dirt Devil that I was always satisfied with. I think this Hoover got the carpets cleaner than they ever have been. The price to purchase it is less than having the professionals come in."
1,LEAKS!!!!!!!!!!,"This is my 2nd unit and its now being returned. Ridiculous. Last unit leaked from the bottom severely! This one does not leak as bad but still leaks through the bottom. I have now saturated my carpet while cleaning my couch because I was unaware my new unit was leaking. Luckily, I was able to suck up the water from the main unit. I have no idea why this gets such rave reviews. The cleaning path is very small, as well as the detergent canister. You can't clean an entire room with one fill up from the detergent tank, you will need to keep refilling. No thanks."
1,"Cracks easily, but at least replacement/refunding was easy too.","We were very excited when we first ordered this product as it had all of the features that we needed for our apartment. Unfortunately, when we received our first unit, it was cracked so we returned it and had it replaced - which was very easy (thank you Amazon.com). Sadly, when we got the replacement it too was cracked - the same piece, but on the opposite side. This one we will also return and just get our refund. Major let down, but we will now research other brands."
4,Works well,This steam vac works really well. It is a big heavy and a bit difficult to change the water reserve. It has a lot of power.
3,Better than what we had but less than what we expected,Cleans pretty good. It wheels around but is kind of cumbersome. Only heats for the drying process. Doesn't heat the water & shampoo so you need to add hot water to it. Seems like the plastic parts are somewhat flimsy. Is quite loud (although at a low pitch).
4,Hoover SteamVac,"This unit cleans as written in the advertisements. It was easy to setup, and the dirty water tank was easy to empty once it filled up. The dirty water was definitely dirty!! I also cleaned the brushes underneath as recommended after my initial use. They were easy to pop off, clean, and reinstall.I would say the unit is a bit bulky and loose. Its bulky, because it needs to have so many tanks on it. So, I don't count this as a big negative...more of a necessity. Just be ready to store it in a space a bit bigger than your upright vacuum. However, the unit seems a little loose in that the moving parts don't make a super sturdy unit once they are all in place. It can be wiggled around and it doesn't necessarily sit completely upright on its own (kinda sits at a minor angle). I don't see this as a major negative, but it didn't leave me with a quality feel despite it being a quality product.I would purchase this unit again."
3,"It's OK, expected better","I've chosen it after reading reviews, it rates excellent. So I've expected quite a lot.We have white berber carpeting, and it definitely cleaned something, the water was quite disgusting. Visually there wasn't much difference. The food stains, I hoped to take care of, are still there.But I do have to say, it's easy to use."
4,Works well for the dough,"This unit works very well. Few little things that aren't so good (cleaning hard floors, water tube not engineered well and had to zip-tie it on, bit awkward changing water etc.) Overall, I like it and would recommend."
5,Awesome,I love this cleaner. I started doing my floors because my baby recently started to crawl. I am a pretty lazy person and I have pulled my cleaner out five times in the last month that I have had it. I have already reccomended it to all my friends and family. It is so much cheaper than paying someone and after a few times of using it you will have paid the difference of renting a machine.
4,good for the money,"at a discounted price this cleaner is a good buy. It's not going to deep clean like a larger commercial machine butfor lighter duty like fresh stains or frequent cleaning of high traffic areas it is convenient and effective. it does have a few drawbacks. the holding tank is a bit small, hard to carry up and down stairs due to lack of a carryinghandle and an on/off switch thats foot activated instead of up by the hand. still, it has good suction, on/offbrushes that work well and applies the solution evenly. its good for the money and i would recommend it."
5,Can't Imagine!,This is my first carpet cleaner and I can't imagine how I survived all these years without it. It is very easy to operate and does a fantastic job cleaning carpets and area rugs. I highly recommend it!
1,Dumps water back onto carpet,"I bought a total of 4 'clean water' tanks in hope of making the leak stop. It would stop for the first hour, then start leaking water out the bottom left rear of that tank. Genuine Hoover replacement parts. Genuine disappointment."
1,What The...,"I received the Hoover within a reasonable time frame. So far so good.The problems then became evident.The machine leaves stripes on the rug as it only cleans in narrow stripes. It sucked all of the detergent out of the nozzle before I could finish a small area. To clean an area of any dimension would take enough detergent to fill a number of 55 gallon drums.The device arrived missing the hose, hose holder and nozzle clean-out tool. The Hoover bunch said the only thing I could do is return the whole thing. Sure, let's think about how much that would cost not to mention the time and effort involved. Here it is almost two weeks later and contacting Amazon about the missing parts is like telling W.C. Fields you want an ice cream as a kid, "" Go away kid...you bother me...""Not happy? What makes you think that???"
4,"Nice shampooer, upholstery cleaner inconvenient","My first impression of the shampooer was that it had a lot of plastic parts. It was easy enough to put together, but I worry about all those plastic parts over time. It did a nice job cleaning the carpet of the dirt, but didn't do so great on stains. I plan on experimenting with some different cleaning solutions to see if I can improve upon that. The upholstery tool works well, and I like that it has a rotating brush attachment. The tool has to be inserted into the dirty water tank each time you want to use it, which is a pain. Also, when not in use, it is nearly impossible to store the hose on the machine. I have taken to simply hanging it in a closet. Also, with the hose, remember to run clean water through it after each use...you will be surprised at how much gunk is left in the hose. Overall, this seems to be a nice machine. I have used it 3-4 times in the last 3 months, and it has paid for itself."
3,Pretty Good,"This item works very well if you read the directions very carefully before you even start.Suggestion: I would not recommend this for anyone who does not have a lot of patience and can read small print and small diagrams.1. Make the diagrams BIGGER and Label them better.2. Connecting the tools directions are terrible. The diagram is too small and badly labelled. Her is an example:Open door on hood labeled Stair Upholstery Cleaning Connection....3. When giving directions for replacing Tank Front Panel E, Well E is not labelled.4. When you replace it with the converter you need to make sure you give direction that the long slot at the top has to fit into the long slot at the bottom of the dirty water tank.Once you figure out these very bad directions and tiny/badly labelled diagrams, the machine works fine.PS I suggest that they design one that has the tool hose ready and all one has to do is flip a switch from ground to tools.PS I have a science degree and am not stupid nor impatient."
3,its an ok buy,"it does a great job cleaning, but it is all plastic and really unstable. after 6 month (i use it almost every day though, with two puppys and a toddler) the handle broke and it took a while to get hover to replace it (they wanted to argue about the warranty).i would buy it again because it cleans awesome and you cant beat the price"
2,Used?,"I received the Hoover SteamVac in what appears to be used condition. The plastic is scuffed and dirty and the cleaner looks like it was just thrown in the box. I am hesitant about taking the time to put it together, just incase it was returned due to not working. Pictures will be posted."
5,Great Product,I really am very pleased with this product. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best product for the budget I had. i highly recommend this shampooer. I love that it has spinning brushes and I really appreciate the attachment brush. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
4,Hoover Stream Vac.,"Great product, this carpet cleaner will pay for itself in no time..It is easy to use,stores in a small space. The small attachment is good for small spaces and easy to use."
2,Disappointed,"It was very complicated to assemble it and to get it working. It is a heavy machine but, cleans pretty good. A piece of the staircase part came a part before I start using it. If I had to do this all over again, I would have not buy this item from Amazon, but from a local store so that I could have return it. I am disappointed."
2,plastic broke...,The machine itself works great. I do not have an issue. it cleaned most of the floor stains and dries fast. However this thing is made from cheap plastic or just plain bad engineering...I accidently pulled back on the handle before i stepped on the lever and it just snapped. It will not stand up straight anymore. Also after 10 uses the rotary scrubbing thing fell off. It looks like the plastic inside was glued together and kinda as i mentioned just fell off... i'm semi-handy so it's all glued back together and works fine... but it feels like crap quality to me. I am still looking for a sturdy long lasting one.
5,Does the job.,"The Hoover does a nice job of cleaning carpets that are not worn to the ground. Don't expect miracles if you failed to clean your carpet for a long time. If you need a basic carpet shampooing unit, the Hoover is for you. Simple to use. It does require some assembly out of the box. Please READ the instructions before doing anything! It will save you some time later.The dirty water container does need to be emptied often but I guess that is a drawback when you desire a compact shampooer.It is also very important to thoroughly vacuum your rug before you use the Hoover. Otherwise, the narrow intake may become clogged reducing performance.Be patient when shampooing the rug moving the unit back and forth slowly allowing the brushes to do the work."
1,Cleaning machine,"After one has used the ""steam vac"" for a few cleanings,the dirt and fibers get caught up under the the suction plate. I tried every screw I could find and this plate will not come off. Therefore, it not only looks nasty, but the suction is blocked. I will never by a hoover again."
1,Never had sooooo bad experience,"this item was obviously previously returned by another customer. The packaging was damaged, the inner packing was missing so everything was just thrown into the box. Item scratched and missing screws."
4,Very satisfied,"I purchased this machine, instead of renting as I have several times before, as I realized it would not be the last time I needed to clean areas of my carpet. I figured renting several more times would pay for the machine. I am very satisfied with the machine. It is relatively easy to use, as compared with a rental. The liquid chambers are smaller on this machine than a rented, but it is thus, easier to run. I would recommend this machine to others for home carpet cleaning."
4,"So far, so good...","I had the Bissell Powersteamer for 2 years. Did a great job, but lost suction over time and was hard to clean.This one is very easy to clean. No bagged water tank. Bigger clean water tank for less refilling.Gave it 4 stars because I found it didn't pull up stains as well as my previous wet vac did. I found that I needed to press the ""clean surge"" button for regular cleaning, not just stubborn stains."
1,dead within the year,"when it worked it was fine; but sure as the warranty was to expire it died..motor popped and nuttin would work. we tried to get it covered under warranty...good luck if you are not close to a warranty center. we will have to drive over a 100 miles to one in the bay area, at over 3 bucks a gallon, plus bridge fee...wow!!!i would never buy this product had we known, you are then benefiting from our experience. buyer beware is what i think."
4,Am Pleased with the purchase.,I was very pleased with the purchase. It was smooth and transaction went just as I had hoped.
5,Go Hoover!!,So tired of paying for carpet cleaning so I started checking out prices and reviews for Steam cleaners. This one had 1000's of great reviews and the price was very reasonable. It was actually $30 less than most stores and the shipping was free! Thank you Amazon!! Fairly easy assembly and works beautifully!! So glad I made the purchase. I'll make my money back in two and a half uses!
5,Carpet Cleaner,"A great device, works like a charm. A little bulky on steps, but the hose length relieves that issue. Does not come with hard floor attachment."
4,Great Steam Vac!,"So far, so good! This steam vac worked exactly as all the reviews I've read said it would. It cleaned very well and my carpet didn't take long to dry. The reason I gave it four stars was because the hose that is stored or loops around the handle slips off when using the steam vac. Because the hose doesn't fit snugged, I used some tape to wrap around the cleaner to hold the hose in place while cleaning my carpet."
4,Can't beat the price!,"Great buy! It works wonderfully. Cleans very well, however, for some really stubborn stains pretreatment and a little elbow grease is required. Overall perfect for what you pay. I haven't had any clogging problems at all since I do clean it out completely and I have owned it for three months now. There is a slight leak issue for some reason but I find it's only when you switch from using the hose to the main body. But it's not that big of an issue for me nothing's perfect."
5,Excellent,I have white carpet and a dog who loves to rub herself all over it. Didn't want to pay professional cleaners every month or so. This vac does the job quickly and easily (after you read the directions!) Well designed and fast drying. Very glad I didn't get one with a smaller tank than the one gallon. Recommended
5,SteamVac saves the day,"My father's dog visited with him and left ""deposits"" all over my living room rug. Since this dog is fed waaaaaaay more treats than dog food, you can imagine my problem. I borrowed an older SteamVac from a friend and had immediate rescue. I was so pleased, that I bought my own unit. The one I chose has a power brush. For me, this is not only good for upholstery, it has been fine cleaning the tiny grooves in linoleum floors in the bathroom. When I was young, I just used a bucket and scrub brush and got down on my knees. But I haven't managed to stay young. smile. This product lets me keep my house as clean as I want."
1,Ordered a new SteamVac but received a USED one.,"I was really excited to get this SteamVac after reading all the reviews on Amazon. When the product arrived, I could tell the box had been opened and retaped. I opened the box and sure enough, the SteamVac was dirty and the cleaner heads were full of hair. Needless to say, it went right back and I borrowed my mom's Bissel. Worked great and I didn't need to purchase, so maybe it was a blessing in disguise."
2,Used 2 times,used 2 times cleaning okay but switches would not turn on anymore and only used 2 times oh well waste
4,Good vacumn,This vacuum was amazing. I have rented the steam vacuum from our local home improvement store and let me say this vacuum did a superior job picking up what those vacuum's have not. It took me a while to get a hand of it but once I did I was able to clean two rooms in less than two hours. Light weight and easy to maneuver. The only bad thing is it seem I was dumping the dirty water tank more than i was filling it with clean water. Overall I give it a thumbs up.
2,Not Good if You Have Pets,The bolts in the back did not fit and as such I constantly have to monitor the rack that is supposed to be bolted back there as it also keeps two pieces together. When the bolts fall out the water tank spills. Most of the items I have purchased that are made in China have pieces that do not fit and I have to go to the hardware store to get the right item. The performance was great for the first few times but after a couple of months the machine no longer took water in. I expect the fact I have a Tibetan Mastiff is the reason. It cannot handle pet fur. I dont recommend this steam cleaner if you have a long haired dog. I now am going out and buying a different steam cleaner for pets.
5,Great Product!,"We have a larger than average family and two dogs so there were times when I would rent the Rug Doctor on a monthly basis. What an inconvenience. The Hoover SteamVac is a terrific product. (The assembly was easy, too.) I use boiling water rather than the hot tap water and I think the results are outstanding. If I have a small spill in the living room, for example, I can do a quick area in no time. I am so happy with my purchase. I keep it in my kitchen closet and have had occasion to use it almost weekly. That may sound like a lot but it is so much easier to use than the large commercial machines you rent, that it seems effortless.This product is perfect as far as I am concerned."
2,Not so great,OMG this cleaner leaks so bad! I read the other reviews about preventing the leaks so I made sure I put it together the exact way the directions stated. STILL Leaked alot! Cleans okay if you can get past all the water!
3,Hoover Steam Cleaner F5914-900,"This cleaner worked well (3 1/2 stars) for about 2 years, but now multiple small (cheap) plastic parts have broken after common household use. Therefore, we are purchasing a new one(not this model). We have a home with dogs and children so we have used it on a frequent basis. I am not purchasing this model again and would recommend someone look elsewhere."
3,Damn loud!,"I think others here have already gone into great detail, but I did want to mention something that really makes a big impact on how often I uses it. This machine is DAMN LOUD! I mean, really loud, loud enough that I feel I need to wear a pair of mufflers, the kind you wear when you use a lawn mower. I don't know what the decibel range is, but if noise, or the lack of it, is something you're at all sensitive to, you'd probably want to skip this carpet cleaner.other than that, I'm satisfied with its performance."
5,Love it!,"I read all the reviews on different steam vacs and chose this one because it had the most positive feedback. I got mine yesterday and was very excited so I put it together ""very easily"" and cleaned my Open floor plan great room and dining area. I have very light beige berber carper that shows everything. I have 3 cats and 2 young children. The carpet is 10 years old. I usually have carpet cleaners come 2-3 times a year. I had a large 4ft x 6ft rug under our kitchen table when I removed it you could see where it had been cleaned before. When I got done you couldn't tell a difference in color anymore. This machine cleaned just as well as a professionals. I am very pleased and wish I had done it sooner. I also used the cleaning solution that came with the steam vac."
4,Powerful suction,"I have used this product on my entire house once so far. It took a long time, but worked great. Although I didn't see a huge difference in the carpet,(I keep it pretty clean anyway) the water was filthy. The carpet dried very quickly. I made sure to go over a few times with the suction so the carpet wouldn't stay wet too long. It seemed to dry within a half hour to an hour. I also used it on a spill and the spill was gone instantly."
