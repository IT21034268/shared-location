1,Doesnt work,I ordered this bc Im irregular and thought it would be an inexpensive alternative to buying OPK. It doesnt work. Not only that the light broke about 3 weeks after owning it.When I asked my dr if it was a good tool to help he said yes and no. Maybe it doesnt work for everyone but like I said it broke regardless anyway.Take my advice and dont waste your money...
4,Almost perfect coffee press,"The coffee press makes the perfect amount of coffee (2 American size cups). The beaker is not fragile - it's basically a chemistry beaker. The coffee plunger screen is a good, tight fit and prevents coffee grounds in the coffee cup. The only fault, if there is a fault, is that the top is made out of chrome-like plastic and not metal. Other than that, we are very satisfied with the product.FYI, the beaker arrived shattered in the first shipment, but Amazon quickly sent a replacement that arrived in one piece."
5,Excellent 1 mug french press,"I am the sole coffee drinker in my family. I want to make a mug (12 oz) and a half of good coffee. This french press is exactly the right size. I boil 12 oz of water, add 3 tbs of coffee and make exactly what I need. Its a good glass coffee maker. Lives up to the Bodum name."
2,good but with some flaws,"- The press slides easily on smooth surfaces. They should have put some rubber on those steel legs.- When pulling on the knob it is very easy to lift the glass out of its metal holder. It means you have to hold the glass while pulling.- The inner filter does not slide easily, especially when moving upwards."
3,Intro to Probability Models,"I bought this book for a class I'm taking. I'm already familiar with most of the material in the book, and in my opinion this book goes about explaining proofs poorly.I wouldn't recommend using this book to learn probability unless it's required for a class. Even then, I don't feel that it's too worth the money."
2,Not for the novice,"If you like to learn concepts through pure math without clear examples of how to apply the applications, then this is the book for you. Absolutely dreadful!"
2,perfunctory treatment of stochastic processes,"Tries to do too much and fails in delivering a rigorous understanding of the subject and this utter lack of mathematical rigor is the main flaw of the book. For a better understanding of stochastic processes consult the books by Karlin, Hoel and so forth. However, it does have some nice problems and some good examples to work through. I think that the author's other book, ""A first course in probability"" is much better."
4,A story of friendship between women,"Swimming Lessons is a great story of friendship. One of courage and determination. You cannot imagine my surprise to recognize the location of the swimming pool Marna learned to swim in. My best friend and I drove over and were delighted to find the pool as described, viewing window and all. What a kick! The characters were engaging. The relationship between Marna and her mother, Roxie, and the way it developed seemed very real to me."
5,"Great, sturdy set!","I bought a set of these for myself about 8 years ago and every single piece is still in excellent condition. They are very sturdy and rather large. This set was a gift for my father & he too loves them. None of the pieces have melted or deformed and I am usually one to melt just about anything.I would HIGHLY recommend this set. Although the pieces are large and kind of bulky, they are definitely worth it!"
5,this started something...........,I loved this show when it came out and bought this for a christmas gift. NOW after watching it after so many years its gotten me on a hunt for other shows I used to watch. I HATE IT when you find good OLD shows because then I end up spending more money on getting others =)
4,Was glad to find this,I used to watch this cartoon series when I was a kid and I wanted to introduce it to my own children. They loved it as well and wanted to watch the DVD's everyday. I'm glad Amazon had this series available.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"I really liked this show as a kid, and wondered how it would stand up to the test of time.Well, it stands up great!I watched a couple episodes with my soon to be 7 year old, and he was hooked as well.We've already gone though 2 of the 3 DVD's, and I can't wait to finish it."
3,Don't confuse this for the 2006 edition!,"This is NOT the great 2006 box with booklet, extras, audio drama for un-produced 3rd season's finale ""Requiem"". Instead, this is a very simple box set containing nothing more than the 27 episodes, distributed on 3 dvd discs (each 7GB disc contains around 3 hours, leaving a not-that-great picture quality, though I've seen worse).I was going to rate this 2 stars, but then I noticed I was just mad at myself for buying the wrong pack (I actually wanted the other one). It's still a regular box set, and will probably be enough, if you're really only interested in the show's episodes. Just keep in mind that it contains nothing special about it, when you make your buying decision.I'm rating it ""completely regular"". 3 stars."
2,3rd DVD is unreadable,"I was so happy and hyped out that the DVD set arrived earlier that expected. Unfortunately, the third DVD was unreadable. The reason why I bought the set was so that I could finally get the chance to see the final season of D&D after so many years of waiting but I still lost that chance. Very much of a bummer."
2,the set was rushed!,"I bought the BCI release I noticed the audio was out of sync and two episodes had glitches, the First episode on disc 2 and disc 3 they are unwatchable and kept constantly freeze up, so I had to skip them, don't bother with this set cause ""SPOILER ALERT"" They never Go Home!"
5,Dungeons & Dragons: The Animated Series,Even better than I remember it. Great entertainment for everyone in the house.
1,Zero quality control,"I'm not rating the content of this DVD. If you're looking at this product, you've most likely seen the episodes and know that they're great. I would give the cartoon itself 5 stars.The problem with this set is that there's apparently no one monitoring the quality of these DVDs as they go out. I've had two different sets so far. The first one had a mark on disc 4 that caused it to skip, so I returned it. The second set I got has marks on two of the DVDs and scratches on a third.These aren't the result of the discs coming loose during shipping either. These are how the DVDs were sent out. The game booklet that comes with the set is just as bad. Both copies I've had just about fell apart in my hands. Unless you don't mind getting scratched defective DVDs, I would avoid this set."
3,Sprouting since the 70's,"Ran a Vegetarian Restaurant in the 70's. We'd re-purposed a fiberglass shower, added shelving with screens, and a timer for rinsing throughout the day. Previous to that, I'd done Sustainable farming; mason jar - punch holes in top - rinse seeds and drain twice a day. Decided on this ""Newfangled"" version but have been disappointed. Though following directions, it often does not want to drain between levels. Flimsy plastic cover cracked with little use but turns out it's a standard large coffee can top - easy to replace. Not bad for novices if you can get it to consistently siphon for you. Otherwise, just do a large glass jar (commercial spaghetti would work fine) with some holes punched in the top (lay on side throughout the process)!!"
4,works pretty good!,"Pros: Sprouts are stacked vertically verses all over the counter. Looks nice, especially in the window during Michigan winter. The price is relatively affordableCons: Occasionally seeds will get stuck in the little holes situated around the outside edge of the tray and the tray will overfill.Overall..... I like this sprout grower and use it to rotate sprouts wrote the week so that I always have fresh sprouts ready to eat."
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't really happy with this sprouter. The little pieces are easy to get lost, and sometimes the water wouldn't drain completely, and the sprouts would sit in water and rot and smell. Or I'd have to figure out how to dump the water without losing the sprouts. I'm going to buy a different kind next time."
4,Good for lentils and beans ONLY,"There are too few holes in this that are too small for it to be used for alfalfa or clover or any other little seeds like that; not enough air will circulate and the seeds will clog the holes so the levels wont drain. However, it's perfect for sprouting lentils, peas and garbanzo beans."
2,Not what I expected.,"The sprouter shipped without the bottom drip tray. Also, it's a very small unit. I know, should've paid attention to the dimensions."
5,for all hair types,"You can use this on damaged or color-treated hair. I asked my hair stylist if it can be used on permed hair. She said ""You can use this before, after, and during. It's great for your hair."" You can rinse it out, or leave it in. If you leave it in, a tiny bit goes a long way. You don't have to use Paul Mitchell shampoo with this conditioner, but both Paul Mitchell Shampoo One and Awapuhi are very good."
3,Decent but flawed,"This was my first harness and it has served me quite well, but it does have a few limitations that come with the price. It is fairly thick and bulky, and the lack of speed buckles makes it tedious to take on and off. I recommend getting a version other than the AL to get elastic leg loops. Adjustable leg loops don't add anything unless you have very thick legs, and they gradually loosen making it yet another point of failure you have to make sure is double-backed. The currentBlack Diamond Momentum SA Climbing Harnesshas speed buckles and adjustable leg loops, but the leg loops have a variation on speed buckles as well (trakFIT as BD calls it), and I would recommend that over the Momentum AL if you want a cheap harness."
3,Could be better,"There are several problems with this harness. First, it is not comfortable for me. The harness is painful even while just hanging from it while planning my moves. Second, it is not very durable. The belay loop and the fabric on the leg loops are a bit fuzzy after just one afternoon at the gym. On the plus side, the harness is very light, it does not restrict my movement at all, and is very comfortable to walk around in, but I buy a harness for its climbing performance, not its hiking performance. I upgraded to a BD Big Gun harness after using this once and am glad I did. Also be aware that the sizing is off. My 33 inch waist is on the smaller end of the adjustments of a medium harness."
4,A pretty good harness,"I've been using mine for several months for both indoor and sport climbing. It's a great fit, wonderfully padded, with a number of loops to keep your straps nice and neat. It truly is a lot of bang for the buck and definitely a great first harness. The one thing I *really* hate are the way the gear loops stick out. The front ones tend to rub the inside of my arms when I walk or just stand there with my arms to the side. Since I don't carry any equipment in the front loops, I'm about to cut them off."
4,Great starter harness,"This is my first harness. So far, I'm loving it. I've had no ""comfort"" problems once it was properly adjusted. There are plenty of loops for attaching your equipment. Even though this is an inexpensive harness, the textiles look and feel very strong. Once you take it off, it folds and returns neatly to the mesh bag it arrives in (super convenient).I am a pretty slim guy with about a 29"" waist, and the ""small"" size fits me great. I'm probably right in the middle of this guy's range in terms of the waist, with the thigh loops almost being too big. They are very snug once I tighten them, though.I dock one star because it does take a few minutes to properly adjust the waist, thus making it inconvenient to put on and take off. Otherwise, a great product, especially for at the entry level."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"This was my first attempt at the horror genre. The game is certainly creepy, and has some great scenes, but I didn't find it captivating at all. The game was just too slow. The plot was on the corny side, but it had a few nice surprises. I think the biggest problem was that you couldn't just spend an hour here and there for this game. It required large chunks of time to really get into it. Too bad, because it looked like it had potential."
2,walk around forever,"As mentioned by others, the spooky fog is really nice. The begining story ( wife's letter, go through spooky graveyard, meet the first monster in the town ) is intersting. But, after getting into the apartment building ( it's not easy to figure out too ), the game becomes really boring. I get in and out of different rooms trying to find those tiny coins and keys in order to progress to next step. ( some doors are locked and I need to search other rooms to get the tiny key --- this trick repeated many times) After I get in and out of different rooms for hundreds times, eventually I can leave this building .....relax? Nooo, I just get into the next apartment building, and I need to do this in-out-in-out job again! The only way to stop is to eject the disc and retun it to store.Fortunately, I RENTed it."
5,A Good Overall game,"I never played the Original, so I can't say if this is a good sequal or not, but this game is very well done. My favorite scene, being the Hospitol... knocking off the cracked out zombie nurses with my shotgun one by one... It just doesn't get much better than that... the graphics are great, and you can remove that ""noise"" effect or whatever its called, instantly. I guess im new to the genre, for the movement gets a little jerky at times, especially fighting that pyramid head monster thing... but all in all, its a solid title... and the Story flows along very nicly, there were times I thought I was lost, and bam there was a cinematic that took me to more zombie mutilating goodness... There is a Side Quest included, although I haven't checked it out... its supposed to be an Xbox exclusive or something... just means more zombie killing for me I guess"
2,Silly Heroine...,"This book just rubs me the wrong way. I love Catherine Coulter & was excited to pick this one up. However it was not to be.I can't abide the heroine...Who names a romance heroine ""Meggie""? C'mon! It's hard to find her sexy or beguiling with a childhood nickname attached. And yes...the cat racing got on my nerves too.There are better Catherine Coulter's out there...no, there are some wonderful Catherine Coulter books out there, however Pendragon isn't one of them."
4,wonderful,"this is a great shirt, my only complaint is that the large logo was on the back not the front of the shirt like I thought it was when I bought it! Other than that it was a great shirt"
4,"Works, but....","This long cord does what I need it to do, but video quality does suffer. Picture is a little fuzzy, definitely not as sharp."
2,Signal Noise,"I have been using it coiled up for the meantime behind my HDTV setup. Currently I don't need to use the full length, so I am only running about 6 feet of it. That said, it gets some pretty annoying signal noise, so I have taken to not using it. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,picture not accurate,"Be aware this set does not come with grey nore pik chips but only purple chips, it has a large amount of blue chips but what can u expect for the price, it ships fast but picture is not accurate."
4,"Buy it for the chips, not the case","This is a great deal for chips - you can't beat the price, and they are solid, heavy, excellent quality.The case, while metal, is poorly built. Ours arrived with one of the rivets on the handle half out, and I wouldn't trust it to carry the 20 pounds of chips even if the rivets were good. Also, if you fill the space cut in the foam interior with chips, the case will not shut. You have to leave a gap of about three chips' thickness shy of the top in order to be able to close the case."
2,No clear target,"Beginners, intermediate and advanced players need different types of information. The problem with this book is that it does not seem to address any specific level or make distinctions about what is suitable for different skill levels. To the author we all seem to be ""athletes"". Very basic information apt for an absolute beginner (how to hit a slice backhand) is mixed with advice for more advanced players (top spin lob, top spin/side spin serves are all described as fairly easy). I felt that some basic information was missing. For instance there was very little discussion of grips, and the little there was I found confusing. Further, the technical discussion about rackets and strings, although interesting, is today clearly outdated. You will not find discussions on new ultra-light Titanium rackets, and how they can affect the type of tennis you play (shorter swings?). In all fairness stiff Titanium rackets came to the market years after the book was published."
4,"Great value, but...","This unit is well designed and functions nicely, but the winding handle is short and flat, the opposite of what it should be, which makes rewinding the hose less than easy. To the company's credit, I've heard they have recently revised the handle design. Amazon's price cannot be beat, I've seen these things advertised on the net for 3X the price! Overall I'm quite satisfied with it."
5,Exactly the same as good old one.,"Thank you Ames for continuing to sell your Reel Easy side mount hose reel with the exact same mounting holes. I bought one many, many years ago and it worked so well all of these years. Because of the plastic degrading due to sunlight over maybe 15 years, I decided to buy a new one. The old one still works fine but I'm re-painting our home. The new one mounts exactly using the same screw mounts for the old one. This is a fine hose reel and I recommend it."
4,good product,Quality product no major flaws. I use a 100' hose which is definitely the max. Only minor issue I have is that you must carefully wind it up or it will hang up a bit next time you unwind.
1,Eventually Leaks.,"This is a really nice hose reel, except for when it begins to leak. I have purchased 2 of these so far, both eventually leaking within a year. I wouldn't buy again due to it's poor performance with leaks."
3,Sequel not as good as original,"Bought to replace same one from over 10 years ago. Received first one damaged and Amazon replaced. Next one, which I kept. Not as high in quality as 10 years ago But it does work and fits the same template and mounting screws(No need to drill more holes for another mount). Drawbacks 1: Many rough unfinished plastic edges - sand off so you don't cut yourself. 2:Reel takes almost as much work to turn as the one it replaced(internal quality?).OK as replacement but don't recommend as first installation.Kudos to Amazon for having what I needed and excellent customer servicing."
4,Did the job nicely,"The first job I used this on was in relation to multiple replacement of magnetic window sensors in my house's burglar alarm system. The solder work, and then the shrinking of insulating heat shrink around the connection was, of necessity, done in very close proximity to the window glass and frame. Through the use of the window protection attachment this was successfully achieved without damage to the glass or frame. The gun is extremely powerful, and I envisage using it for many other tasks over the coming years (I hope!). I particularly liked being able to easily stand the gun on its end. The only negative that I found was the operation of the slide trigger to operate the gun. I found that to be a little awkward - hopefully I will become accustomed to it as I use the gun more. Overall good value for money - I'm pleased with the package."
2,"nice tool, good price - not up for hard work","It does exactly what a heat gun should, and it's variable temperature. It includes lots of optional scrapers and attachment in the box.The only improvement I would ask for is a temperature scale in Fahrenheit for the American market.-----EDITI tried to strip paint with it (which it's made for) and it simply won't. Mine will run for 8 to 10 minutes then shut off and refuse to restart for 20 to 30 minutes. Unacceptable for a tool with ""Pro"" in the name.If you just need it for short jobs (shrink tubing?) it's cheap and will work just fine. If you want to strip paint, pony up for the Milwaukee, as it will run all day."
5,Very well done.,In a world of corporate corruption it's good to know that music is still very well done. Like many others I first heard of the band on NPR and ordered the CD. This is very well done tight music and lyrics and the track 10 which shall remain nameless and probably never played on the radio is by far the best work on the CD. Buy this one you will not be disappionted.
4,teacher gives A+,I am a teacher of first graders and my class and I both enjoyed this CD. It is just the right combination of country hit music and folktale storytelling by different voices. The music portions are not full length but perfect to support the story. Good use of humor throughout. Could easily be adapted for a charming play.
1,"Stiff, not soft!","This item did not serve the purpose of making my car seat any more comfortable. It is stiff not soft, and it did not fit between the flares of my bucket seats."
5,Best Quilting Book I Have Found!,"Being new to quilting in 2010, I bought every How-To Book there was. Unfortunately, this was the one I bought last! Since receiving this book, I have decided to sell all my others and keep only this one. It is the best, easiest book I have found and their teachings on different techniques are the easiest to follow! I now don't even consider other books if BH&G has a book on the same subject. Their's is the only magazine subscription I have kept coming. There is a definite reason they have been around for so many years! Thanks BH&G!!!"
3,spooky ironic cover,"This is totally superficial...But look at the cover. The background is the World Trade Center, while the title is Changing Face of Islam in America. The book came out in February 2000, a year and a half before the attacks. In retrospect, the title could have been about the changing face of America due to Islam."
2,Confused on how they sell this,"The picture for this product shows an HP74XL package which also noted ""in retail packaging."" I don't mind the retail packaging, but the ink cartridge that came is not the same shape as HP's 74 so it would not fit my printer. I'm not sure how this will work for anyone, but the company was great in the transaction. It shipped quickly and they processed the return quickly. I've had my printer for over 5 years and have used other non-HP cartridges. Hopefully, it was just an oddity for me to receive this cartridge."
3,Good ink but not HP,I thought it was hp just not in the box. It is not and my printer do not fully reconize it. It prints but cannot tell what level the ink left in it is. I will have to guess or hope when it runs out i will not be in the middle of ay thing rush.
4,Is for my printer what's not to like,"This should ot be up for a rating. Of course, this particular one make more copies. As all ink cartridges, it's expensive."
1,Did not work.,I've been using inkjet printer for almost 20 years and this is the first time that a new ink cartridge just doesn't work. No ink is coming out of it. I've confirmed the printer is fine since it works with other black cartridges.
4,Good price,"Definitely, this size XL, it has better performance than the 74. Is checked. In this way there is a significant financial savings."
2,Very little in the way of actual instruction,"You had better be a *NIX beginner to find this book useful. As a novice Unix admin, I found that this book was WELL below the average intelligence level. Save your money, and get something more challenging."
5,Brilliant Literary Essays,"If all you read is the essay on ""The Open Boat,"" you will be enriched with an insight into Crane's best piece."
4,Good game that brings back music memories,"I've had this game for over 10 years now. There's a mix of easy and hard questions for a good balance. I would say the hardest categories are ""Rock and Roll Heaven"" (dead artists) and ""One Hit Wonders."" A lot of my friends fear the ""Disco Pergatory"" but some of those are easier than you may think. A lot of Bee Gees and Donna Summer in that one. Here's something you can try, it's not part of the original rules. Read the questions WITHOUT the choices first. If the player needs to hear the choices, he/she may but has to move one space back on the board. It adds a challenge to the game.For those who are slightly younger, there's also an 80's and 90s version of this game. But since I listen to ""golden oldies"" on the radio and I stopped following music around the time grunge became popular, this version suits me fine. You'll find as you hear the questions, you'll remember personal things. The game is a great nostalgia trip."
2,I&#65533;m very disappointed,"I was expecting a lot from this game and EASports disappointed me. This game has less teams than the other, it is not possible to choose the stadium, and the championships like UEFA CUP and another's made it very bad."
1,Waste of Money,"Who does EA Sports think it is fooling? This game is worthy of an add-on to Fifa 99 at best.I found myself getting extremely bored of this game.There is, as of yet, no internet support, poor AI, un-real simulation, and mediocre team management. I advise all to wait till the next one comes out- I'm sure after their poor sales EA will finally take the hint and actually produce a NEW game- not some tired version of Fifa 99."
5,He's Darling,"I ordered this Huggable Scooby Doo for my daughter, and I think she's going to like him very much. He's soft and kind of posable, with a bean bag-type body. [...] There are some other talking Scooby Doos available, but this one does not talk."
1,A glorified reference page builder,"Wow, what a huge waste of time and money. The product cannot be equated with its namesake for several reasons: 1)Formatease does not allow you to do future editing on your reference outside of the preview box. 2)Suppose you want to insert your citations after you have entered all your references (Hmm...I guess the boys at Guildford didn't think about that!)You are left having to begin the process of entering references all over again. Is that their idea of format ease-maybe in Hades. 3)Format ease doesn't save your references in memory, it simply applies it to your reference page (I don't think many people can recommend this product for anything other than building a reference page, ... peraps your just better off doing it for yourself.)"
5,Body Movin',"I initially got this CD for the remix of Body Movin' because I'm a big Beastie Boys fan. I'm glad I got this compilation becacause I discovered a lot of good DJs that are on it (DJ Spooky, Leftfield are great!) A friend remommnded it to me and sent me a link to hear some tracks and I was like, OK they sound pretty cool and Body Movin's on - guess I'll give it shot. So I did and it rocks! Been playing it on my car on my way to school everyday and I get lots of good comments on it. Good stuff- I certainly recommend it!"
1,Buy Rollercoaster Tycoon,I bought both RCT and Sim theme park. Buy RCT. It has better options and a lot more depth than Sim theme park. i played sim theme park once and went back to playing RCT.
3,SIM THEME PARK'S OK,"I've owned this game for about two years now, and I don't play it any more because of it's lack of speed. If your looking for a game where you build a theme park, I'd say go with Roller Coaster Tycoon."
3,A game that needed more work!,"When I first got Sim Theme Park, I thought it would be a great game. A week later, it got very boring. Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon, everything is very expensive! A trash can, for example, costs $100! In Roller Coaster Tycoon, a trash can costs $3! Also, there's this advisor that shouldn't have been so picky! He'll say your janitors' patrol areas aren't just perfect, or one person just littered! Big deal! Again, unlike RCT, it has only four themes; one per park. I also don't like the idea of Golden Tickets and Golden Keys, which you need to access other parks. It's really hard to get things just perfect, and since everything is expensive and you can't charge for rides, your cash balance is low all of the time until five years later (in game time). You don't have a very large selection of rides, especially at the start. Overall, this game really bites the dust, and if you don't have Roller Coaster Tycoon yet, get that instead."
2,Not as good as Roller Coaster Tycoon,"This is a good example of how a game company should not use 3D. With the whole game in 3D, it performs rather poorly. I have a Celeron 466 and a TNT2 video card, and scrolling across the screen lags. I think they put too much emphasis on how it looks rather then how it plays. If you want a more realistic and exciting (yet not as pretty) game about theme parks, get Roller Coaster Tycoon."
2,this is fun....well not really.....,"OK- I've had Roller coaster Tycoon forever. It's SUCH a good game. SimTheme park- no. I bought it because I wanted a new theme park game- new rides and stuff. I installed it and had problems right away. It has slow game play, fuzzy graphics, no point, no cool rides, and riding you rides is not cool at all either (I thought it would be!). So seriously, buy Roller Coaster Tycoon. it has cool graphics, awesome gameplay, a point (hey, what a concept!), and is SOOOOOOO much more fun. SimTheme park will make you want to kick your computer because of all the things you can't do that seem so entirely simple (like rotating rides!)! Oh, and the roller coasters are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better, cooler, and easier to build than SimTheme Park. Don't buy SimTheme Park- I already uninstalled it after owning it for 2 weeks!"
2,Kinda' Confusing!!!,"In the beggining it is incredibly CONFUSING!!! It ""may"" get better with time and cooperation. I don't think anyone from 9-99 would ever be able to figure this game out. Although, the graphics are the best in any CD ROM I've ever seen. You can ride the rides, and see from peoples points of views. The ""! Guy"" that ""helps you"" is just AGGRIVATING!!!!!! He comes in weird outfits like Albert Einstein!!! I would strongly advise people not to buy it if you think it's going to be like the ""5 star Roller Coaster Tycoon""."
2,Big Disappointment,"Well, I wish I had read some of the other customer reviews before purchasing this game. Don't let the ""Sim"" portion of the name fool you. I've had nothing but good experiences with other Sim games, but this one is a different story. I didn't have any problems with bugs like other reviewers, but I would describe the game as clunky. It's just difficult to use at first and even after you get used to it, just not a lot of fun."
1,They REALLY need to put zero as a choice of stars!!!,"3 words say my subject:THISGAME...The rides aren't realistic at all, and for a 10-year old it is hard to understand how to build cool rides [with loops and upside down things]unless you build one that is pre-made which is boring. It's too easy to get bankrupt, too. And there's only one way to get rid of the ant thing. It's considered a ""cheat code""(ha!).My summary:THISGAME..."
4,¡Fantástico!,"Esto es lo mejor que he visto si uno habla español e inglés. Hay algunos errores en la parte de español (evidentemente no sé si los hay en portugués), por eso no le puedo dar otra estrellita. Ahora quisiera comprar las cintas."
5,Your children might just clean their rooms from now on!,"Although out of print, this book is a wonderful book about imagination and fun...with a lesson learned. It is about a first landmark in childhood, at trip to grandma`s house by yourself, and about the eventual understanding of a parent`s role from a child`s point of view. Sara, within the realms of her own imagination, finds herself as a Queen in charge of some very untidy fairies in a very chaotic household. Although fun and fancy-free at first, soon Sara longs for some assemblance of order and finds herself exhausted with the behavior of the fairies. It is wonderfully illustrated and beautifully written. This is a book which should be reprinted so that many children to come may enjoy this wonderful tale. Who knows, your little one might just be inclined to clean his or her room more often."
5,good value prompt shipment,"Item was priced better than local suppliers, was shipped promptly and packaged well.the only problem is now I have to trim the palms. Works great what a difference a sharp blade makes."
2,This is wild,Strange and bizzare. Acting Ok... the problem is it's a bad story... Major disappointment... don't easte your time or money.
1,trash,"sorry, but again one of the movies with Matthew Montgomery, who hasn't made a movie up to now, where he is able to proof that he could act. If you like independent movies, this one might be for you, but I think this is just a film you should rent in a video store, if you actually wanna see it. It's not worth buying it. Ridiculous storyline and bad acting, pure trash."
4,Chris M,Classic Disaster Films. Watch all 4 films and watch the changing face of acting. Always worth a watch on a wet Sunday or Friday Night
1,MGM robbing the fans yet again!,"1. All films are advertised as widescreen, which is a LIE. Only Fiddler is widescreen. Especially disappointing when I bought this for West Side Story.2. There's no special features but just a trailer. WTF???3. The picture is horribly grainy and washed out. Especially bad for the most vibrant and colorful film, Guys and Dolls!AVOID this set like the plague! Another attempt to milk the cow from MGM, which must stand for ""Money Grubbing Morons""!!!!"
4,Good book,"This was a very good book and covered more than basic macro principals. It was very well written and added elements to my understanding. I thought it would have more recipes, but that was the only thing that that wasn't PERFECT about this book. I would recommend buying it."
1,Irritating Tone,"I don't normally review books. I feel like this one was particularly bad, and that it is a waste of money. For example, the author spends three pages discussing the ""macrobiotic relationship,"" followed by a description of how she got dumped. Seriously, I understood that the tone was supposed to be a bit chatty since she is a ""hip chick"" but come on, this is not necessary for a book. It is stupid, frankly, and I wondered how it ever got published. Some of the receipes are okay, but they are not all together, and can be confusing to find. I recommend sticking with another macro manuel; don't waste your money."
3,Light Studio Box,"The Digital Concepts PS-101 Portable Lighting Studio is a great addition to my photo lab, HOWEVER the bulbs have already burned out and I haven't been able to find an exact replacement.....actually I was only able to use the box for one day. I didn't have the lamps on except when shooting I'm guessing less than 2 hours total time."
2,Decent Product but I Hope You Don't Have Problems With It!,"This product serves it's purpose, mine came with one of the light bulbs blown out so I called their customer service for help. The light bulbs are $10 to replace so I felt it should fall on the company to replace it.This was my honest to God worst customer experience ever. It was so frustrating that I'm going to go ahead and just purchase a bulb because I don't want to call them again.Their customer service people have no concept of the English language and instead of trying to be patient and understand each other, I was told to call back and was hung up on. When I tried to call back the next day I got a different customer service rep who was just as rude.Buyer beware! I hope you don't have any problems with yours, you will get no support if you do!"
1,One light not working after one use,"The first time I set the studio up, one of the lights had to be ""tapped"" in order to work. The second time I tried to use it, the same light would not work at all.I'm having trouble finding a replacement, and I agree with one writer - the bulbs are way underpowered. They should be a lot brighter.The tripod is pretty cheesy, too!"
2,The Method: Precision Yoga,"This tape is definitely not for begginers. She goes too quickly through the moves and sometimes forgets to instruct you to breath, which is a major part of yoga."
2,not really yoga or ballet,"If you are looking for either ballet instruction or yoga instruction, this is NOT the tape for you. If you are looking for 'buns of steel' or 'abs of steel' you've found it. Very disappointing, very boring, and does not live up to the challenges it promises. There is no challenge at all to any of the exercises. The instructor is very good."
4,Relaxing mood music,"I saw these guys live in Murfreesboro, TN back in 2001 (I think) when I was in school there, and they blew me away. This album is full of atmospheric sounds and moods. Each song has its own groove. It is a great album for listening to while driving at night, because it is very laid back and mellow. Definitely mood music, but it's something I can just pop in and listen to any time. The songs are slow, but there is enough going on to keep you interested. Hopefully they will release a new album soon, but until then I highly recommend this one. If you like Portishead, you will like this."
5,WROUGHT IRON TOWEL BAR SCROLL ENDS LARGE AMISH MADE,"THIS TOWEL RACK IS SO CLASSY IT LOOKS LIKE I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR IT, IS VERY WELL MADE SHOULD LAST 100 YEARS. YES, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ."
1,Try another product,"Yes, this is advertised as a fragrance-free conditioner, which is necessary for my allergy to fragrances, but it seems to have the odor of my grandma's musty basement. The smell doesn't seem to linger so if you can stand the few minutes of musty basement smell until you rinse it off, it will detangle your hair. It doesn't seem to deep condition or leave my hair silky smooth, but for now it's better than nothing. I won't buy it again, though."
3,Can't tell if it's fresh or expired,"Product is sold as ""in retail packaging""; not so. It arrived in what seems to be the standard HP sealed plastic bag, but the bag was NOT packed in a cardboard box as shown in the illustration. HP 75XL and 74XL boxes are normally stamped on the back with the country of manufacture and an expiration date, for example a 74XL box I recently bought is stamped MALAYSIA AUG 2013. I can't be confident that this 75XL cartridge is as fresh."
4,What can I say,"What can I say about ink cartridges. Well, I got them at a reasonable price, they are a hard size to find (XL) & I didn't have to run all around shopping for them, they arrived in a reasonable time, and they worked as promised. That's about it... Joan S."
4,Focus problem,"I think the yukon's review on the focus and noisy problems was true. It can not hold focus on close-ups. And like Rajendra Bansi said in the review ""There is indeed some Zoom lens noise picked up by the speaker when no other sound is present"". Low light recoding is not good at all.Other things are very good."
2,naive to the max,"Maybe because I live in Japan, this does nothing for me. Heard it all before and heard it told better. Reminds me too much of the bright-eyed bushy-tailed who come over expecting it to be geishas and cherry blossoms and find it's pink salons and garbage strewn on beaches. They only missed the Edo period by 500 or so years just like this book missed the mark on really telling a less whiny tale of woe. Have to agree with reviewer who wanted to strangle her because she reminded him(?) of so many non-Japanese here who just won't shut up."
5,My cats and dogs love this CD,I have two cats and two puppies that love to listen to this CD over and over day or night. There are a lot of interesting noises within the music that are very pleasant and calming to animals and no loud annoying sounds or voices to scare them.
2,Not What I Expected,"I wish I had had a chance to listen to this CD before I bought it, or at least a 30 second clip. I don't play the piano but I could have made this CD. It did not relax my dog and I think he hated the music just as much as I did."
2,Kindle Version Barely Acceptable,"The Kindle Version is acceptable ONLY because it does have both The Sargasso of Space and Plague Ship on it. However, from a careless reading of the very confusing text description, I though all 4 of the Series were on it. The Table of Contents doesn't work worth a darn. Selecting one of the two Books sends you right to the Cover Page (or was it the Title Page?). I still believe the Kindle Books are the greatest thing since Paper. But the Kindle Version of that Series leaves much to be desired!!!"
5,Works Great,"I wanted to be able to save my games when playing on my Gamecube, and that is exactly what I got."
1,didn't last long,"We bought this to save Game Cube games on our Wii. It worked for about a week then corrupted. I suspect we just got a dud, but then again, maybe not.... Had to buy another one and found a 128mb for $8 (here in A.com!)"
2,No Room,Unless your a beginner playing games taking only little memory this will do nothing for You.You need the biggest one to play the Major games.
1,Listen Up,"Ok, there is nothing wrong with this memory card, exept it's worthless. If you want to get some bang for your buck just get a Madcats memory card. It holds 1041 chips of memory for the same price. do it"
4,"Fairly great golf game, though a little behing in technology","All-in-all, this is a great game....the only complaint I have is that it lacks some of the more precise realism common in some of the newer games. (i.e. the physics of ball flight, weather influences, etc.)"
1,I was disappointed after reading this book,"It reminds me of a tabloid newspaper. I thought the price was a little high for what I got, as other books offer the same content and do not cost as much. I think the author could have spent his talents working on another subject. Like I say, it is okay, but be prepared for a rehash of what has already been published."
1,well-intentioned but confusing,"Despite the title of his book, Zomchick has not done any research on 18th century law in the sense of reading statutes or legal decisions; rather, he defines ""law"" broadly in terms of social regulation; but that concept is empty if it remains ungrounded in any contemporaneous legal texts. Thus while I appreciate the intention to historicize the novels he discusses, I found it bizarre that he professed to locate them in their legal context without even discussing what most people think of when they think of law."
1,Totally uninteresting and fake,"This guy doesn't know how to write. I thought it was a novel written by a writer. Nope! No nuances, not a credible plot, everything is fake, fake, fake. Uninteresting dope...this Kyle S."
1,"I rate this zero stars, actually","Love Monkey is so slight and poorly written taht it doesn't even warrant inclusion in the so-called Lad Lit genre. Anyone who thinks otherwise either has some personal investment in the matter, or just doesn't read much. Trust me, Love Monkey stinks."
4,Nice for Tailgate,"I have used this table on two separate occasions; once at a tailgate party and once for a deck party. So far, it has really met my expectations. You have to use a tablecloth otherwise the slats could cause smaller items to tip. The product is light and easy to set-up. So far, no complaints."
5,Blizzard Don't Stop,Ultimate Adventure game. Blizzard has the best team of programmers ever! I mean come on STARCRAFT? WARCRAFT? They are all great! Diablo has got to be one of my favorite games!
1,"Jeez, How Boring","For all you Diablo fans who just go nuts over this game I say, ""get a friggin' life!"" You people must work on assembly lines or in factories where your jobs are boring and redundant, because that's what this game is. All the dungeon levels look the same and there's only a few different monsters.....I just don't get it. Call me goofy, but I like games with exciting gameplay, a variety of different-looking scenes and monsters, and LESS redundancy! After I got to the fifth dungeon level and was doing the EXACT same thing as on level one, I went bonkers. Gimmie a friggin' break!!!"
3,Its good,"this will not be a very helpfull review, but read anyway. This is a very fun game but i gave it 3 stars cuz the graphics were never really that great (especially for today's standards) and multiplayer mode has too many cheaters who upload special weapons from their computers and kill you instead of playing the game. Its a great deal at nine bucks though."
5,"A good, simple, fun, violent game.","It's a great way to bash, shoot, and fry demons and monsters. Game basics aren't very original; Tunnels of Doom for the TI 99/4A looked a lot like it in '82. But the graphics and multiplayer aspect make it stand out."
5,Great bang for the buck,The product arrived as pictured and in a timely fashion.They look great around the house.Great purchase for the price!Can't beat it.
2,Did NOT include the 'Speed Clips' as discription says...,speed clips were not in the box very annoying to have to spend more money on what appears to be an over priced product....quality of the net is okay but the cheaper one from Bully is probably a better value....
3,Cartridges work well,"Color cartridge has worked well so far, and arrivedin good time. Much cheaper than HP originals, whichcost way too much!"
4,ok so far,"I ordered this for a Garmin gps, and it's worked ok so far. It was about the least expensive of all the cards I looked at and has done well to date."
5,Great; too bad it doesn't work right with the device I got if for.,"Great; too bad it doesn't work right with the device I got if for. Its not its fault, its the POS that I got it for."
5,Works great,"I bought this from Amazon almost two years ago, have used it in multiple cameras, and have never had any problems. The only thing it's missing is the original packaging, but to save some money, it's perfect and exactly the same as the original. Highly recommended."
5,Worked great for Sansa clip+,"My mom has a Sansa clip, but hasn't learned how to download audio books. I was able to purchase this disk, record an audio book, and just mail her the disk in a regular envelope. No formatting of the drive necessary. And it's really cheap."
1,BEWARE,I have not received this item and the company has not replied to my email. Very dissapointed in this company.
4,works,it worksnot sure about the writing speed its not the best from what i can tellbut considering i was buying the cheapest 4gb card on amazon i cant really demand read/write speed lol
5,A must for all smartphones,Anyone with a smartphone or phone with mp3 capabilities will enjoy this memory module to store their music and photos. Allows expansion of your favorite items with a simple storage solution. Love it!
5,Fantastic service,Had to order while in the UK for delivery in Florida and the whole process was excellent throughout. 5 Stars *****
5,Perfect!,"Very handy and very little, but does the job just fine. The price on this item was very reasonable also."
5,4gigs worked great,the micro sd card fit into the adapter and worked just fine on my camera no complaints to report if you need an sd card smallest or largest (i forget the middle one's name) its for you
5,Cell phone memory chip,I bought this chip for my phone some years ago and even though the phone is out of service the chip is still in service.
5,micro scandisk review,"I was really inpressed by this item, it was in good condition and everything, and it was reasonably priced too. I liked it."
3,SD Card,"Fast shipping from Seller and the card works flawlessly, but they did not provide enough postage for the package. So I had to pickup from the post office and pay an additional $.19 cents. No big deal on the $.19 cents, but a hassle to have to go to the post office and wait in line!"
3,"Good price, but don't seem Sandisk quality",I just received these after 3 weeks of waiting. they arrived and barely fit in my reader. Compared the pins and they are off by a bit and had to clam them into place. I use it in a test enviroment so it is not that critical. I am using them to save the card reader slot from being over used. The micro-SD card worked without any issues (hence the 3 stars)
5,it is a very good product,it is a very good product Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging)Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging)
5,JustInTime,"I had ordered HTC Aria for which I wanted this card. . .and it came the same day as Aria as I was awaiting, a day earlier.Need not say about the quality. . .it's SanDisk :-)"
5,It works!,"I've been wanting to transfer photos from my phone to my computer for years, and my phone carrier doesn't let me send picture messages to e-mail. So I finally ordered this memory card, and was able to post them on facebook within half an hour. The actual memory card is really tiny and a little hard to grasp; I feel like I'm going to break it just holding it. However, that's the only size memory card that fits into my LG phone, and this one worked perfectly."
5,"With a little tinkering, it works great.","I bought this for myTracfone LG LG800G with 1200 Minutes and Triple Minutes for Life!! (Tracfone). At first it did not work(would recognize the memory card but not use it), but I read online that formatting the memory card would fix the problem. Works just fine now. For a dollar a gig, what's not to like?"
4,"Great price, does the job...","Usually memory chips, either they work or they don't. When they work, they pretty much last a life time. The only trick is to make sure you are installing it correctly with your phone. Don't ever force it into the slot...I installed this into my Samsung Eternity and had a few issues. I went back, read the manual and realized that the battery needed to be removed. After doing so, installing it was a breeze. I formatted the chip with the phone and ended up with like 3.7 gigs. One problem that I noticed was if you plug the micro chip into the adapter too deep, it does have a tendacy of getting stuck. I would take it easy if you are swaping from your phone to PC alot."
3,Does not work in a Blackberry Pearl!,"Ordered this based on another Blackberry Pearl Owner's positive comments. Did not work in my Pearl. Spoke to a Blackberry rep who said the maximum media card capacity for the Pearl is a 2 GB. Don't make the same mistake I did by listening to the Pearl owners who said the 4 GB works because it doesn't! It did, however, work for my friend's Curve!"
1,Dont Work,this thing does not work for my samsung e900 phone...waste of money.now i need to buy another one.
4,Tight Memory,"When it does come down to Memory cards, they are honestly becoming much more vital with our everyday electronics, whether it is digital cameras, video game systems like the Nintendo Wii, and now, that is starting to become a must-have for your music and media players, like your MP3 Player, and cell phone. Sandisk knows that feeling, and they have made some of the most high-quality memory cards and media on the market, and thst comes well with their 4GB Micro SDHC Memory Card. This is a great tool that is used to securely store media from your computer programs, as well as now becoming must-have accessories to expand your everyday MP3 Players on the go like Sandisk's Sansa Clip+ and Fuze MP3 Players, with more of them having the capability of expanding memory in their devices. I absolutely recommend this as a must buy if you want to securely store your media files, computer programs, or anything for your everyday uses.Price: BCompatability: B+Overall: B"
4,Super value,"Comparing prices, this is a best buy. Performs exactly as required. Shipped immediately and delivered very quickly.Up to usual quality expected from Sandisk and at a fair price."
3,Write protect probems,I received 4 of these in a very fast delivery time and inserted one in my laptop memory card reader. My laptop did not find the chip. when I was ejecting the chip it was found. I used a micro chip USB reader attachment and had no problems. Also 3 of 4 with the adapter showed write protect when inserted. They were very touchy in my chip reader for SD cards. When they were inserted the write protect tab slid back. It could be my chip reader but it sure made me nervous for a while. They worked great with a microSD usb adapter.
4,Great Seller. Fast. Worth the price :),"The only reason why it's not 5 start is because I only got it and I can't promise it's perfect, but I am very delighted that the product was delivered a day early. Packaged right and it is working just fine. Thank you. I'd definitely buy again."
5,Great value - good product,Great value - don't understand why people pay so much for this in department stores when they are so cheap here.
1,"DON""T BUY IT DOSEN""T WORK!!",I bought this and placed it in my Samsung Eternity right away. It did not work! the put it in my Kodak camera. It did not work! Then put it in my computer. It did not work! Placed it in my other Samsung cell phone. It did not work! It say's that it needs to be formated but it won't work.
5,A Must Have for your media phone/PDA,"I bought this for the Samsung Blackjack II and it is working very well for me. It's great because I can put all my programs, a decent amount of music, tons of photos and even rip a dvd for on the go (one that I own, of course). Also, if I have to hard reset my phone (which I did), most of my stuff is sitting safe on the card (tip: take the card out first:). For the price, you can't beat it!"
3,Minor annoying glitch...,"The memory card works (suprisingly as it is not supported officially) with my Nokia N95. It is not superbly fast, but fast enough: at least a bit faster than the original Nokia 1 GB card.However, and this is annoying, the card itself CAN NOT be read by my Sony Vaio laptop using its internal memory card slot! The only way that I managed to work with it was by using the USB adapter than Sandisk gives you in the package (indication that Sandisk knows that it won't work otherwise). This requirement should have been mentioned in the product specifications!"
1,bad buy.... rip off,item was shipped for .64 cents and was charge $7.00 for shipping.. it is these reasons the economy is at it's down fall Greed destroyed all past civilizations.. as it's destroying the world of today.. wake up.... plus items don't work ...bye not buy..
1,Scandisk 4gb micro,"Well, a complaint more on the supplier than the product itself. The micro was deffective(like my spelling)... Which isn't a big issue, this stuff just happens. I sent it back, filled out the paper work. then nothing for a couple weeks. so i called. and they refunded my money(i think i got lost in the shuffle). of course i asked them, ""why did you do that? i wanted you to send me a new one like the paperwork stated."" i never got a response. i suppose it's better then them keeping my money, but customer service is def lacking there."
2,Unsure,"I bought two of these. I still can't get one of them to format and have no clue or instructions on how to return it. As for the other one it will only work in certain devices and not at all in my phone. The adaptors they come with don't work, so I can't use it in my computer at all. Definitely would not purchase online again."
1,shoot,"The thing didn't work. Like throwing money out the front door. I Don't think it was the sellers fault but, I suggest you order a few of them for good measure"
4,good product and price,"good product and fine service, and quick with a good priceblah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
5,Seattle's best kept secret,"Recommended for fans of Pedro the Lion, Red House Painters, Low, and any sort of really, really good music. I've seen Seldom live and they are amazing. Blake Wescott is quite a producer as well. Their next release is going to be even better."
2,I hate the scent,"The label doesn't identify the fragrance of this conditioner, but I would describe it as the smell of grandma's medicine cabinet."
2,Predictable,"Tired routine from same nosy, judgemental woman. I've read several books in the series and each one is basically the same. No more for me."
4,Why haven't I heard more of them?,"This band has some nice music. They're on a similar spectrum to Keane circa 'Under the Iron Sea'. Similarities to Thom Yorke's voice are also noticable, but their sound is unique enough that outright plagiarism is certainly avoided. Given the success of piano driven bands as of late, I'm surprised Summer Lawns hasn't made more of a name for themselves. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates the work of Keane, Radiohead, Snow Patrol, The Fray, etc.The cello is a nice touch."
5,Contents of World Air Power Vol 13,"Combat Report: Sarajevo Air Bridge; Briefings: VC10 tankers, Ilyushin Il-78M 'Midas', Grumman X-29, Chrysler C-27 Spartan; MiG-31'Foxhound' feature; VMA-124 USMC Skyhawk unit feature; Fuerza Aerea Colombiana photo feature; Interview: Alaska HH-60G Pave Hawk pilot; Focus Aircraft: Saab 37 Viggen (50 pages); Variant Briefing: Sikorsky S-70/H-60 part 2 - Air Force and Navy versions; Croatian Air Force photo feature; Air Power Analysis: Southern Asia"
5,wonderfully entertaining,Virgin Alexander was very entertaing! Glad to have the DVD because it will be watched many times. The humor at times was subtle and I'm sure to catch things I missed on the first viewing ! The cast was wonderful. Loved Rick Faugno's dance number at the end . I'm sure we'll be seeing more of this wonderful cast in future movies. Fallon/Barret wrote a great script!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good Reference,"People would be surprised to see and know just how many of the ""new"" models and poses are not really new at all. This is a great archive of examples of nearly all the erotic genre we know today, yet as a historical reference or origin. ANYONE interested in photography in any of the ""Glamour"" genres should have, and read this book."
5,Great book,"My 3 yr. old son loves reading this book with us, I should say to us. I dont know what else to say. It was a good buy."
4,A sociological study of the Scotch-Irish,"A sociologist rather than an historian, Lehman presents the Scotch-Irish as one of three component parts of Scottish immigration to North America: Lowland Scots, Highland Scots, and Ulster Scots (Scotch-Irish), rather than many other approaches that present them singularly or as a component part, along with the Anglo-Irish and the Native or Catholic Irish, of Irish immigration."
4,Instant Immersian Starter,"This has been an excellent vocabulary support for my daughter who has entered a German Immersion Program as well as for my nephew who needs additional help in his Spanish class. The program uses flash cards with colorful pictures to teach vocabulary. Talking animated characters assist the child through their learning experience. To reinforce the vocabulary, there are interactive games which are colorful and interesting. I especially like that there is no limit to the number of times the child can have words or phrases repeated so it assists in pronounciation of more difficult words and phrases."
4,The Neutrogena T-Gel products are great if you ...,"The Neutrogena T-Gel products are great if you have a dry scalp. I used the shampoo and conditioner about once every two to three days and I used my regular shampoo otherwise. I could definitely tell a difference. My scalp was not as dry and flaky as usual. I definitely recommend the Neutrogena T-Gel products as opposed to other dandruff shampoos. The only thing that was less than perfect about the conditioner was the smell -- not bad, but not exactly like a flower garden. I definitely recommend the product and enjoyed using it."
3,"Well, with us, it's a two-for-one review. My ...","Well, with us, it's a two-for-one review. My son loves it, says it works very well, and smells good. Me, I learned that even if a new product is from a company you trust and use products from, it's a good idea to test it first, before using it for real. (Apparently, I'm sensitive to something in this product.) However, my son likes it so much, that I'll more than likely buy this product for him."
5,I'm very pleased with the results from the ...,"I'm very pleased with the results from the Neutrogena T-Gel Conditioner. The cold climate had really dried out my scalp, and none of the conditioners I've tried seemed to help. After using the T-Gel just once, my scalp wasn't dry and I had no more flakes. It also gave my hair a nice shine. It smells nice, too. No harsh dandruff shampoo smell. Just clean and pleasant. I highly recommend this product."
3,just o.k. quality/ won't last more than 3 years or so.,"Bought this for the size and shape as a rear bag on my bike. At the same time purchase a small tool fork bag from Fox Creek Leather. Both arrived at the same time. The Bell is a faux leather (which is o.k., but when wet, swells and gets spotty. It will not last long term. The Fox Creek one was super thick real leather, has been on the front of my bike for a few years now and is in great shape with a simple occasional damp rag. I have removed the Bell from the bike."
1,Top Hoax,"The received product does not match either the advertised description or the picture.The material is not brass but cheap galvanized sheet. The tightening nut is not a butterfly type but a cut tin rectangle that is stamped ""TAIWAN"".Definitely not worth the price and I will be returning the item immediately. I feel stupid not having read te reviews before purchasing."
3,Where's the handle/guide rod for the stone?,I would expect to recieve a guide handle (metlal rod with small bend at end) with the purchase of a new stone. The new sets you sell have a place to add stones as well as a guide rod. No guide rod sent with new stones just isn't fare!
3,speed up my 1st to a 2nd grader,"This software was pretty good the zoo zollions I think was the best my daugther enjoyed the changellen, the print shop curious george was good also, the spanish was very good and to my surprise it was easy to change to a different language. But when it came to the reading part of it. it was borning and not that much changellen only in the creating your own story the dictonary was good. Only 3 stars because I wanted something more out of it for my 7 year old going into the 2nd grade."
4,"Great tool, great buy","This is a little gem. It's small, it's easy to use. It takes great videos and the camera function allows you to get some outstanding action photos. I love it. The only thing more I could ask for might be an external mic jack. Other than that - buy it. My neighbor used it to film wrestling and went right on line and bought a gigashot R-60."
3,No Comedy This,"The jacket notes bill this movie as a ""heartwarming romantic comedy"" and Amazon's product description refers to it as ""funny"". Please: Heartwarming and romantic it may be, but a comedy its not -- from the very first scene it's about death, and it's not black humor. No living happily ever after here. Good drama; no romantic comedy."
1,Griffin and Phoenix,Great actors but bad movie script. Why would they agree to do this depressing film.Should have rented the movie and saved myself some money and grief.
5,Great book if you've had a suicide in community or family,"This book doesn't tell the reader what should have been done or could have done to save the person who committed suicide. Instead it tells the stories of the survivors whose loved ones took their own lives. It was a powerful resource that I used in working with high school students who lost a classmate to suicide. I just made it available to students to check out. So far, I have only had good reports from them."
1,I Hate this Vahki Vorakh.,I hate this vahki Vorakh because one day I was playing with my vahki vorakh then it's weapon broke. The same thing happned to my brothers white Vahki.
2,Average,Like alot Of Artists&Groups from Back in the day who Had that One SOng&the rest was FIller the same can be said of The Floaters.but their One SOng is a Timeless Classic that Alone is a 5.but the rest Of The Disc is Average.Very predictable Words&Music.but the Title cut still BLows A FRO Out.The Long Version is THe Jam.
1,In Question???,"I expect this book is great, like all of Cussler's books. However, I don't read or speak Spanish and can't make a judgment. There was no indication that the book was in Spanish other than the title and that didn't help in the selection. I gave the book to my Spanish-speaking cleaning lady. No review from her as of yet. Thanks."

1,SCORCHES ANYTHING THICKER THAN WATER,"I bought this pot early this year when money was tight and my kids and I were forging out into a new life on our own. It is awful. It scorches EVERYTHING thicker than water. Cream of potato soup? Scorched. Mac and Cheese? Scorched. Chicken and Dumplings? Scorched. Soup Beans? Scorched. It's fine for crab legs or veggies with LOTS of water, but I work from home and my time is too valuable for me to have to spend it constantly monitoring the pot, so I am springing for a better one and will turn this one into a flower pot."
4,Stainless Steel Pot,This is a good pot for the money. Not too heavy but big enough for many purposes and the price is right.
4,A review Depth Takes a Holidy,"I think Depth Takes a Holiday is a very entertaining book on the lives and experiences of people in Southern California. In addition, the Author's light-hearted, relaxed, and humorous style of writing made it a very entertaining book.I strongly recommond this book the young adul who would find it to very similar to their own experience. by Long Ngo CSULA July 22, 1999"
5,Bravo Iota.,"This albumn is a musical masterpiece. The overall balance that is achieved on this albumn is spectacular. I first heard iota after downloading one of the songs from Napster - and instantaneously had to purchase the entire albumn. This magnum opus of an album is a credit to the band and clearly demonstrates the immense talent and potential that Iota have. Song 1 - Triplespoon, with its mix of powerful vocals and sensual strings sets a strong tone for the remaining 10 songs that follow. A must for anyone who claims to enjoy music! Bravo Iota - Encore!"
4,Good taste,"This package of Turkish delight was good. If you don't like nuts, this is the right one. It makes a great gift for any festive occasion."
2,Turkish Delight Review,"I was thought they would be softer than they are, therefore I was disappointed when trying them."
1,ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY WITH THIS PROGRAM!!!!! I cant believe that the manufacturers of this thought it would be something that someone would buy! I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this, but mistake learned, and I will NEVER buy Topics Entertainment CD program AGAIN!!!!!!"
1,No good.,Not what I thought it would be. You can only use actual pictures and you need a scanner. It is virtually impossible to use.
2,Poor quality,"I guess for $25 it is what it is.The orignial that was purchased lasted about a year. Let's see how long the ""warranty"" replacement lasts."
2,eh,"I bought 3 of these for my girlfriend's car and within 2 months one has blatantly failed. That's a 33% failure rate as far as I can see. The others work fine. I'm glad it has a ""lifetime warranty"" Now if I can just figure out how to get that going...The other two do work fine though."
2,Broke quickly,"I bought this to fix my camaro window. The clip was slightly different than the old motor. The metal pin broke and kept sliding into the motor. I had to cut away the plastic and solder on wire. Other than that, and that it is louder than the origional This part is fine."
2,Sucks,"I bought it so I could hook it up to my PC and listen to my Nano on the PC, and be able to pick it and take it to go and not miss a beat. But it sounds like crap. The remote sucks, it wont let you go through menus and such. If you want to go from music to say a podcast or whatever, you have to use the controls on the ipod. So toss the remote. Right this moment I am listening to a podcast and it makes these humming noises and its driving me nuts! In order to make it stop, I have to unplug the usb cable in the back. I regret buying it. I could have done the same thing I am doing now without it! Side note: I bought this plastic cover stuff for it. Invisible Shield by Zagg, AWESOME! you cant scratch the nano if you tried, and I have! But the adapters are so tight on this dock, when ever I take it out the adapter plate comes off with it. So skip the dock and buy the invisible shield instead!"
2,Poorly Done Horror Movie,"'The Living and the Dead' tells the story of a husband who has to go away to help pay for his wife's medical bills. The mother is left alone in the home with their adult mentally challenged son and nurse and the result is a horror movie that is just not good. If you enjoy bad movies or bad horror movies specifically this might be a good selection for you, but 90% of the movie loving world will not love this piece of work.** NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,"Banal, ugly film. One of the worst I've ever seen.","I can't even fathom any of the decent reviews a film such as this has garnered. It's filmed in an ugly setting, with dull cinematography, muted colors, and the most unappealing cast of characters I've ever seen in any film, any genre. Maybe, die hard lovers of the extremely twisted side of indie horror cinema will find something here. I definitely did not. I've seen some of the most inept, artless, and pointless films of the 70's, 80's, and through to the present day, especially in the horror genre, and this is easily one of my all time worst watches."
4,My kids like this product.,"The item was purchased used. It arrived in excellent condition. Me being a math major and older do not like some of the instructional methods, but ... My kids use it and like it. That means a lot."
4,One of the best contemporary writers out there today,"I enjoy Jim Harrison emensly. His writing, to me, is seamless. I recomend this book often to friends and aquantances. Jim Harrison paints wonderful, vivid and memorable images with his words. He seems like the kind of guy I would love to sit and have a beer, or glass of wine, with and just chat. I highly recommend this series of noveletts."
1,Battery failed to hold charge,"This battery arrived with about a 2/3rds charge and operated the camera fine. I charged it through the camera to a full charge and removed it for storage. 2 weeks later, the battery was fully discharged, and would not accept a charge.Spend the extra money and get the JVC battery."
2,does this work??,"I purchased this hygrometer/thermometer mainly to measure the humidity in my house, but I don't know if it works. It has read 41 since I got it. Is that the normal humidity in a house?It seems awfully high. I live in Arizona, where it hardly ever rains and when it finally rained the other day, the reading never changed. I don't think it's working. The thermometer part seems to work fine though."
4,Isabelle,"This book was given to me and my sister-in-law as a gift with the understanding this was a new author from our area. When I started reading Isabelle, I could not put it down. The era of the book and the places things occurred was fasinating. The characterization of the was truly believable. My sister-in-law and I had interesting conversations of the fantasy and realities of love and its captures. I am waiting for Kelly Gregson Plante to continue with this trilogy."
2,Disappointing mastering,"Due to a technical defect during mastering,this DVD(a verbatim transfer of the old RCA/Columbia Pictures VHS program) clips off the start of the song ""Maneater"".Hold off on buying this 7-song collection,because BMG may someday be releasing a more extensive Hall & Oates video collection on DVD.Legal problems concerning Lightyear Entertainment's claim of a long-term license on the 7 videos included in ""7 Big Ones"" have BMG's DVD on indefinite hold."
1,"""7 Grainy Ones"": Atrocious DVD","AVOID THIS! The source material for this DVD was clearly VHS tape, as the audio and video quality is beyond substandard. It's awful enough to release a set this skimpy when Hall & Oates have a vast video catalog to draw from. It's downright criminal when the 7 videos shown look and sound as bad as they do. Hopefully, RCA (which owns the masters) will see to it to release a comprehensive Best Of career set of H&O, the best-selling duo in rock history. I own 400+ DVDs and have never seen anything this bad. Laserlight, you're light years behind the technological curve."
1,very poor quality video and audio,"Music is my favorite, but the image and the audio is very bad. no quality.consider buying it when it goes on blu ray"
4,A good bargain - for me at least!,I found this DVD at Goodwill over the weekend for 99 cents - so it was quite a bargain for me!All the hits I remember from MTV's good ol' days - when they actually played videos!A keeper! A++
1,Daryl Hall & John Oates Video collection,Bought this item by mistake.... very old video - kind of dissapointed....
5,Beautiful Reflections,"On our walk with Jesus, we are called upon continually to ""Love One Another"". In his new book Disciples of Love: Prayerful Reflections for a Deeper Christian Love, author Abel John reflects on a broad cross section of scriptural passages and shares prayerful insights for applying our Christian faith to everyday life. I have found Abel's reflections quite inspiring, and have enjoyed pondering them as part of my own spiritual journey."
4,Excellent but missing a few things,"First off, I enjoyed the book; it's hard to put down. But why is everyone but Yancy so unsympathetic? He hints that he has problems with his adoptive parents but doesn't elaborate; his girlfriend, his co-workers, supervisors, and most of his ""clients"" are shown in a very negative light...yet he doesn't talk much about how his job may have changed him for the worse. He appears to evolve into what he feared--an ambitious, heartless seizure expert...well, he rescues a dog, so he's not totally bad. Keep in mind, I really thought this was an excellent book, yet I had trouble with the author's perspective. I'd also like to know more about how the IRS has changed since the time-period he describes. In spite of all this, I'd recommend this view from ""the inside""."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"a decent based-on-a-true-story fiction or a lacking memoir. the author rarely directly relates thoughts or feeling, mostly describes things in a documentary tone, there are no real dramatic personal events for the narrator, what's interesting about it is mostly the dialogue which must almost all at least be paraphrased if not embellished.often leaves unanswered questions. e.g. he's very excited about some strategy to identify tax protesters (people who don't pay taxes because it's not in the constitution), it's apparently a turning point in the story, but frustratingly, what he actually plans to do isn't explained. it follows on to a particular seizure of a car, without how this one tax cheat was identified as a protestor even touched on, we're just told that he is one. that's just the culmination of a whole bunch of frustratingly underexplained procedural ideas like repeatedly referring to liens and levies without specifying what they do."
1,not cut out for a job at the IRS,"As a retired 30-year Revenue Officer (tax collector) with the IRS, I can't agree with the majority of the descriptions of IRS office culture offered by Mr. Yancey. I worked in a number of offices across the nation... and became acquainted with many many decent IRS employees, as well as thousands of disgruntled tax delinquents. Like any job, that of the tax collector is what you make it... you can be dissatisfied and mean, or you can be kind and still get the job done. Like any book about the ""mean old IRS"", people will read the book to find sensationalist issues. Any organization has ""rogue employees"", and IMO at the IRS, these persons are in the minority."
4,engaging account of life inside the IRS,"This is a compelling, novel-like story of the author's 12 years as a revenue officer in Collections for the Internal Revenue Service, from his initial recruitment by a classified ad that never mentioned who the employer was to being a hardened and efficient seizer of assets. Yancey tells a story of initiation into the IRS, office intrigues, taxpayer sob stories, and the shenanigans of tax protestors. Yancey took to his work, with which he had a love/hate relationship--mostly hate, at first, yet he kept with it and found motivation to stick with it and become the best revenue officer he could, for reasons he couldn't clearly identify. I found this book a surprisingly engaging read, difficult to put down."
2,Bragging of a Tax Collector,"Author has this journey from what am I to do with my life to discovering that he has a gift for collecting taxes.It is an interesting concept, but wow the protagonist is vicious and malicious when it comes to collecting. Even his coworkers (fellow tax collectors) don't go to the depths he goes to when it comes to collecting.I found it difficult to have any sympathy whatsoever for the guy. Confessions imply that he is coming clean as a way of repentance. Take a cue from Zacchaeus in the Bible when it comes to confessions of a tax collector.He comes across more as boastful and less as confession. They should title the book Bragging of a Tax Collector."
3,Hope they do better next time....,I really wanted to like this game but so far the thrill is dying fast. It's mainly due to what many have stated before and that's the new fatality system. The uniqueness is gone. I personally think this game was built backwards. If space is going to be a problem then give the fans what you know they'll love (fatalities and plenty of 'em) and then if there's space left over add the fillers. I'll keep playing and see if this grows on me more but fact that I haven't shut myself in after playing it once is a sign it may not get any better.I enjoyed Konquest mode in Deception but after 5 min of Konquest in Armageddon I'm already tired of it. Why oh why did they trade off the fatalities for this stuff. I know 60+ fatalities would have been a lot but I think the loyal MK fans will agree it would just have been another challenge to conquer. I pray on the next gen consoles they get it right.
2,huge disappointment,this game was a huge disappointment.i wish i never bought it.sure every character is on the game but they hardly have any moves.the comboes are weak.some of the boss characters are weak.also i didnt know that kreate a fatality would replace their individual fatalitys.that was real disappointing.The kreate a fighter pissed me off alote.You can only make one fighter per profile.if you want to make another fighter you have to make another profile and earn more money to make him.i dont think you should have to unlock anything in kreate a fighter.This game is boring.when ever i want to play mortal kombat i will play deception not armageddon.
1,does it mean other 8 books I read with same information,"had no smart information ?.This is same information you will find in her other books but now we have a different cover and I guess more smart name !!.If you already own any one of her book, don't waste money for different covers !!. Lillian too publishes new book every months with same information/content but different name and cover , sorry.."
5,Add this one to your collection,"If you are a fan of Acid Jazz or even traditional Jazz, this is one you definitely want in your music collection. This CD is the next best thing to seeing the Broun Fellinis live."
4,"Not the best, but very close","This one was a great addition to the collection, however, I found that it had too much talking and too little action. Don't get me wrong, Anthony Perkins has never made a bad movie, but this one left something to be desired."
2,Our Next Caller Is Norman Bates,This is interesting only for the fact that Anthony Perkins reprises his role for the fourth and final time. There is some interesting banter between Bates and a Radio Phone-In host. The flashbacks and Bates' current dilemma are just not dramatic enough to be very interesting.
4,arrows are included !,"The other title of the same author ""making arrows the old way"" has its text already fully printed within ""making indian bows and arrows the old way"". Amazon gave me a discount so I could get both titles at once, and I end up having twice the same text and pictures on arrows... Do not do like me, buy only this title, not the arrow one. Nice book by the way..."
4,Excellent,"This product used to be part of my hair care regimen a few years ago but it became more and more difficult for me to find it in stores until I didn't find it at all. Recently I tried Amazon and it was there!!! Even though the instructions say to use it once weekly, I used it twice weekly for a month or so until my hair became lustrous and strong, then I use it as suggested to maintain my hair looking healthy. Not only I notice the difference, but almost everybody around me. It is easy, fast, effective and affordable. Also, my hair is thin and the product does not add unwanted weight. One of those old products that should never disappear from the market."
5,Very good keyboard & mouse,"Smooth feel (except for space bar), nice wrist rest and programmable keys. Mouse is also pretty fair. Sorry about the fellow that got only one keyboard & mouse, I got three of each. Great deal at this price."
2,Neither fish nor fowl,"Perhaps it's the translation, but this book dances around its point, and lacks coherence. It's meant, I think, to convey a sense of how it feels to work on science, particularly biological science, but it never really draws us in. Written more as a series of independent essays, it turns out to be not all that memorable, and not all that interesting."
5,happy dogs,"I now have two very happy puppies, who like to tease each other in their game of keep away. Even tho I bought several balls they are only given one at a time, ie their own keep away game. I have given them each one but that is no fun. Please keep handling these they are the only ones that my puppies will play with"
2,They sent three different types of balls,"Some were not even latex. My dog is very specific on his black and white soccer balls. We received three kinds, including a red and black ball that he ignored. Not the point of the purchase. Still less expensive than our local shop though."
5,One of the best books i have ever read,"Dive Book 3 is one of the best books i have ever read. It is about these four teen interns that are in Cote St. Luce on a diving internship for the summer. They start off having a good time and everything is running smoothly. But, after about three weeks of being there they find out that their captain is a treasure hunter and not a scientist trying to ""learn"" about the ocean. He is just using them for the treasure that they find. But what they werent expecting was a few deaths because of this situation. They get through the summer by sticking together. To find out what happens you will have to read the book, but the story makes more sense if you read the series!!!I really think that these stories are great to read and are perfect for people that like stories with mystery and action. I think that these books are great for anyone in grades 4-8th!!!!"
2,its Ok,"It is a hard topic, Blood ewee but there is HEALING Power in the BLOOD of JESUS, really, our human blood is important well priceess to us, we can not live with out it, But the BLOOD of JESUS has Healing Power"
4,Good Book,"This book was first printed in England in 1985, so don't expect any information more current than that. It is not a price handbook either. What it does provide is a high quality history of the development of the watch from the Middle Ages with a fair deal of technical explanation. For one unfamiliar with how watches are made, some of the terminology will be difficult. The book also provides some examples of how to research a watch and how to engage in the business of selling watches. Unfortunately, information on starting a watch shop in England in the 1980s is not very useful for most American readers of today, and the research is only moderately interesting. But as an historical introduction to watches it is a top-notch overview, suitable for the technically inclined beginner. The photos are of high quality."
5,Great teaching tool for parents and children,"I purchased this book which is a part of a three book series so that my grandchildren can learn about their government. The book has beautiful illustrations of the U. S. Supreme Court and presents a lovely snapshot of what goes on in that big white building in Washington, D. C."
4,Pretty Good,"I've read many good horse-books and this is one of them. I've read many other books in this series as well as the ""Saddle ""Club"" series and the ""Thoroughbred"" series. I think this book is better than all the books in the ""Saddle Club"" series, but ""Thoroughbred"" books are my favorite. If you like jumping this book would be good. I like racing more and enjoy the ""Thoroughbred"" books, but this still is a good book."
4,It is okay,"This is the only book I've read of this series, but I think that both ""The Saddle Club"" series and the ""Thouroughbred"" series are better. If you are looking for a book about Lipizzan horses, then read it. But if your looking for books all about horses and fun things in them, then read the ""Saddle Club"" series. All in all, it's not a bad book, but I have definatly read better ones."
4,TRANCE !!!!!,"DJTiesto interpreta cabalmente el concepto TRANCE, que muchas veces es confundido con CHILL OUT, o inclusive con HIP HOP. Sentarme frente a los 8.500 PMPO y disfrutar de la musica TRANCE by TIESTO es para mi lo maximo. El agotamiento de una semana de de trabajo desaparece."
5,amazing CD,"All of the songs on this CD are wonderful, and I believe it to be DJ Tiesto's best compilation. His opening song, Fiji, and DJ Sakin's song are all trance classics. I highly recommend this CD to anybody who loves DJ Tiesto/DJ Sakin/progressive trance from 1999-2000."
3,Decent coverage of duplicate strategies,"The book has decent coverage of duplicate strategies and conventions like weak twos, but nothing earth-shattering. There are two different editions - ACOL and Standard American, so make sure you get the right one.For a better coverage of duplicate techniques, see ""50 Winning Duplicate Tips"", also by Klinger. That is an outstanding book!"
2,let down,"i bought this cd without knowing what i was getting (i do this a lot, working at a record store) - it has yet to grow on me. it strikes me as a poor attempt at trying to be like diana krall. chapin does not play a dominant instrument (flute on occasion), which makes me have less respect for her songwriting. maybe i am being unfair, i hope that i will change my mind; but, at this point, i am pretty sure i won't listen to this cd a whole lot. it just doesn't move me."
1,remington shaver cord,the cord didn't fit on the shave... and I sent the shaver to a friend in California with hopes they can find a cord that does fit the Remington shaver
1,Good service bad cord,"The cord arrived quickly. However, the cord does not fit the newest basic Norelco shaver 7300 series. After reading other reviews, which I should have done before ordering, it appears this cord does not work for newer model Norelco shavers."
3,So so,His first book was phenomenal. I struggle to get this one completed. It tries to bring in loads and loads of history to the point where you start to get lost. The material is rich indeed but too much of a good thing.
1,don't bother,"you've read 'agains the gods' and know of mr bernsteins superb reputation as an investor, so you're excited about what will surely be an interesting and informative read . . . well, we all make mistakes, and this is clearly his. it's dull, dense and messy. i had to force myself to keep reading even though i was stuck in an airport . . ."
2,Boring,"I bought this book because I thought ""Against the Gods"" was a great book. I was, however, disappointed because it was tedious and not very enlightening."
4,Diesel DZ 7048,"I'm very happy with the watch. It's totally what I expected it to be. The delivery was faster than I thought. It took about a week to deliver it to Finland. It was very convenient way of purchasing stuff, although I had to pay for custom taxes as well."
2,eh,"smells bad. very easily leaves your hair super greasy. sorry old fashioned vo5. not into you, much better newer products."
5,Captivating!,"Thrilled to find a movie that i watch over and over and still want more! Truly loved this movie! Great suspense, great acting, great filming and look forward to more by Zack Parker!"
3,Scalene,"This was a watchable movie, however really do not recomend for someone to pay money to rent it, more of a watch it for free kinda movie."
4,Cruzan Lover,Love this riddim. To bad greensleeve just dont mix cds. Love the various artists performing to the beat but it gets old after a while.
2,Rockport Mens Carson oxford,"Shoe looked much better in photo. When we received them they look very cheap, don't look like leather more like a cheap shoe from Walmart or Payless. Wouldn't recommend these for a man that is on his feet very long or has to walk very much."
3,"Ok, but not great","I have this book as the textbook for my intro drafting class in an ID program. I found it to be very uninformative in regards to drafting, but it may be ok for high school students who are just learning how to draw and use mechanical tools."
3,not for beginners,"I am just starting out in this field and have no background in drawing or drafting. This book is too technical and does not use an easy step by step approach that would be helpful for beginners like me. This is the book we are using in my first Interior Design graphics class, and I don't think it is appropriate for beginners."
2,Review of Kindle version,"My primary purpose is to review the Kindle format (2 stars) as opposed to the book itself (3 stars). Because I love the Kindle it is always my first choice to buy books in that format. Unfortunately, this book does not read well on the Kindle. The problem is much of the content are that of images which, on the Kindle, border on illegible -- the zoom view is only slightly better than the standard view. The images are much better on the PC version of the Kindle viewer but not as good as the paperback version of the book.As for the book (3 stars): it is a requirement for an architecture class I am attending which is why I made the purchase. I am a beginning architecture student and interpret the book to be a helpful overview of architectural graphics but not specific enough to be instructive.Overall, I would buy the book again but only in the paper format."
4,Great selections!,"I'm a neophite to classical music. For me, this DVD was an entertaining introduction to new composers. And soloist, Vadin Repin, added a refreshing dash of whimsy. I was prompted to purchase other recordings of Mr. Repin after the enjoyable experience derived from this DVD."
5,"The Natural Physician's Healing Therapies by Mark Stregler, N.D. - Proven Remedies that Medical Doctors Don't Know",I was very happy with this book! It is all I thought it would be. J.R.
5,EASY TO USE,"Dr. Stengler's book is an easy to use, fact-filled book. I have used alternative medicine extensively for the past 7 years, yet I found so much new information in this book. It is comprehensive, all the topics are explained well and easy to understand and implement, so that even a ""beginner"" would benefit greatly from it.This book deserves at least a 5 Star review."
3,"Good information, but...","I was a little surprised to see this book when it arrived. For $12.00, I got a small, ""checkout-isle"" book. I can't question the value of the information, however the book was created on an ink-jet printer, has several grammatical errors, and has an overall ""self-published at Kinko's"" feel.I found it written in a very straightforward way, which is good. It tries to be a bigger book than it is, and seems to have a lot of word-filler and awkward, unnecessary formatting.It's a handy book, but is a little over-priced for what it is. It wouldn't be as well received as a gift because of the overall poor production quality. It wasn't the best value, but I've done much worse."
5,Best Tiesto album out there,"I somewhat like Tiesto, with his collaborations with Ferry Corsten in Gouryella, his independent productions, and of course, his records and remixes, but not to the point of exuberance. Not until I managed to pick up this album.This is easily the best album that Tiesto has ever done. I was a bit underestimated, considering what I've heard on his ""in search of sunrise"" mixes. Though, I never thought this type of pure hard trance would be fashioned in a way where it could be transitioned effortlessly, and that's what Tiesto has done.Overall, an incredible mix by one of the Netherland's best. This reminded me of Paul Van Dyk's ""politics of dancing"" or Ferry Corsten's ""mixed live in spundae"". Two very excellent albums that feature hard beats, big bass, and emotional downpoints. The cover's great too. It's probably the best looking cover in my collection. A great example of how fun and dark a club scene appears in an eye of a dj."
4,Adorable adaptation,"The drawings in this re-telling of the Goldilocks story are so cute! My 2-year-old daughter has really enjoyed the Jump At the Sun versions of fairy tales, and I'm grateful for stories with characters that look like her."
4,Great Book,This is a great book for all children especially children of color. My 4 year and 7 year old enjoy the story. It's a classic book modified to show respect and responsibilty.
5,Such a lovely album,"I got turned on to Eva Cassidy when they played Fields of Gold at the Winter Olympics in Utah this past year.I had never heard such a beautful version of that song, and I had to hear more. I found this album, ordered it, loved it. And I do love Fields of Gold, but my all time favorite song on this album is ""I know you by heart."" It is just stunning in its beauty. Eva Cassidy soft mellowness sounds to me like Bonnie Raitt, but with a higher vocal range. This album is a great showcase of Eva's talent and shows she could sing far beyond the simple ballad style. I highly recommend it as probably everyone else who is reviewing it, but it is truly worth every penny. Buy and love it. So glad there are recordings left of this lovely voice. So glad she was with us for awhile."
5,I Love It,"I am a singer, and I would give almost anything to be able to sing like this. Eva Cassidy sings white blues about as well as anyone I have ever heard. She pours herself into this music, and I suspect that for her, singing was living. I have the greatest respect for her craft."
5,And now she is gone.,"It's been a very, very long time since I heard a singer who could give me goosebumps. I hope someone issues an anthology of all her songs so I don't have to buy each CD."
5,The best voice I have ever heard !!,"I happened to hear a NPR story on Eva and caught a small part of ""Fields of Gold"". I had never heard anything like it. I ordered this CD without reading reviews or listening. I received it today and just got through listening... no absorbing it. The texture of her voice, etc. all the things people who have experienced her know. I cannot do justice with words describing the depth this CD touched me. I am just happy God lent her to us for a while. BTW... I am ordering every CD they have by Eva and hoping for more."
3,"Pleasant, enjoyable","This is pleasant and enjoyable as an album of good to special songs by a talented vocalist. Adding the story of her passing just at the time many of these songs were being produced makes it a little more haunting, similar to the feeling one has listening to ""The Wind"" by Warren Zevon. Background arrangements on many of the tunes are sparse and simple - perhaps too simple in a few cases - showcasing the vocal. A highlight for me is the title song, ""Songbird"" - though familiar with the version by the songwriter, Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac, I didn't realize until listening to Eva Cassidy's version what an awfully beautiful song it is. This is one case where the sparse arrangement works very well. ""Wade in the Water"", ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Wayfaring Stranger"" are other highlights."
5,Fantastic voice.,"I have this CD and also ""Time after Time"". I love them both but this is my favorite. She has such a beautiful voice that it saddens me to know we will never hear from her again. You can't go wrong making both purchases. Matter-of-fact, I am going to see if there is one I may have missed!"
5,THIS WOMAN TOUCHES YOUR SOUL!,"I just got this CD and am listening to it now and it's beautiful. Eva can sing anything and I think I would love it because of her. Her voice is TRULY ethereal. When she sings, you feel her vulnerability and emotion, and it touches your own. She will touch your soul. It's like anything she touches is gold. Her voice is pure and clear, her range, both in voice and style, is wonderful. She is really a songbird herself with an angelic voice, called home to sing with angels like herself."
4,Looking for CD Songbird,"Just what I was looking for. CD is no longer available, so I emailed the Co. & they found me a used one. Thank you."
2,Eva Cassidy music CD,"I wanted the ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" song. I was very disappointed in all the other music on the CD."
3,Maybe with your girlfriend sitting around a fire at night,"About the dead nothing than good, is a dutch phrase. This is in a way a sad CD, the father Eva Cassidy compiled after her dead. But the music didn't touch me, the voice is sweet but dull in my opinion. Somebody on this site said Cassidy is better than Crawford and Streisand, the last two are ""over-singing"". I think I like over-singing. This CD is boring for me."
2,Overrated Disc,"Wow, 130 reviews, all positive and I'm thinking.... Well, I'm thinking, they're crazy. I heard about Eva Cassidy, read about her and checked out the listener reviews before finally finding the disc and buying it straightaway. I am thoroughly unimpressed. Her vocals are nothing special, certainly, it is easy to see why she went mostly unknown for many years. Unexceptional in delivery (there's a better version of ""Over the Rainbow"" on the ""Corrina, Corrina"" soundtrack that blows Cassidy's away). While I am sorry she is lost to the world as a vital artist, it does not lend me to amend an opinion of her work with a sober ear. Perhaps some of her other discs are better, but that would do nothing to justify the hype and sales volume of this one. I will be trading it in at the earliest opportunity."
2,Undistinguished: disappointing after all the Hype!,Undistinguished: disappointing after all the Hype
3,Some Very Good...Some Not So Good,"I was looking forward to receiving this album more than anything I've ordered in quite some time. The reviews in here are glowing and remarkable, yet I was a little disappointed in the CD. Being I had never heard an Eva Cassidy album and bought it on the strength of Fields of Gold, which is on the Greatest Chillout Album in the World album, it is a so-so album. Fields of Gold, Songbird and Over the Rainbow are out of this world. If I could rate those songs only the album would be a 10. A few of the other songs irritated me, mainly Wade in the Water and Wayfaring Stranger. I am not a fan of women who sing high, namely Patti Labelle, Beyonce and Whitney Houston type soul. Half of this album steers toward that. I wanted the more pure and level delivery versus the screaming banshee wail delivery. I would recommend it for sure on the strenght of the 3 songs I mentioned. They will give you chills when you hear them."
4,pretty good,It's not as good as the real thing but it's pretty close. I haven't had horchata since I left SoCal but this definitely brought me back.
4,Grown and Sexy,"Pounding bass, seductive lyrics, fluid melodies meant for the grown and sexy (man and woman). If you're not shy, you can rock it while you're driving down the highway (roof back, windows down). Rhythms good for working out, be it roller skating, step aerobics, or pole dancing. Be aware, profanity in two songs."
2,The Soul Flower Has Wilted!,"I don't know why En Vogue hasn't taken the hint that they aren't as fly as they used to be. Their previous album ""Masterpiece Theatre"" bombed terribly. Now they have completely changed their style and their music. Plus they lost another member, Maxine, who had one of the strongest voices in the group. The material on ""Soul Flower"" was severely weak. The lyrics were unimaginative and truth be told, I was actually praying for the album to END! The only reason I gave this album 2 stars instead of one was because the artwork was creative. So if you DON'T wanna waste your money, I strongly suggest that you DO NOT buy this CD!!!"
2,"Never, Never, Never Shoulda Bought It!","Only two members of the original quartet--Terry Ellis and Cindy Herron--remain on this lackluster release by the Oakland hip-hop vocal group En Vogue. The group is now a trio, with the surviving original members joined by Rhonda Bennett. While their first releases, in the 90s, were joyous and sassy, ""Soul Flower"" lacks the immediacy and power of that early work. It would perhaps be unfair to catagorize this record as flat-out bad (truly, it's not), but it is the first En Vogue album that I find somewhat forgettable. New fans should begin instead with the girls' stronger efforts, such asFunky Divas, which is still their all-time classic. Also highly recommended areBorn to Sing, andMasterpiece Theatre, the latter setting hip-hop arrangements and lyrics to instantly-recognizable melodies from classical music. All of these albums are FUN--which is precisely what ""Soul Flower"" tries to be, but isn't."
5,Soulful soulflower,"After 4 long years we get another en vogue album.And it was certainly worth waiting for.Rhona's voice is brilliant, its strong enough to keep up with the two original members without overpowering them.If Rhona stays it'll be a great boost for EnVogue, but something tells me she'll be moving on just like Amanda.I love every song but my 5 favourite songs are1.All U See2.New Day Callin3.Million Different Ways4.I Do Love You5.Ooh BoyIf you love EnVogue you'll love this."
2,HOLD ON...... to your money.,"I'm one the biggest En Vogue fans in the northeast US. But this album sucks. The harmonies are so so and most of the material is whack and has no soul. As co-producers on this project, I expected the ladies to also write something, but didn't. The 'remake' songs on this CD are okay, that's about it. As far as looks go, I'm not feeling the new member, nuff said. I'm looking forward to see what Dawn has in store for us, bye now."
4,Compelling,"I found this compelling to watch as the performances of Bacall, Harrelson, and others successfully pulled me into what was a deliberately slow-paced film. Harrelson is impressive as he appears in virtually every scene and does a great job as the gay ""Walker"" caught up in a murder. It's been some time since I saw a movie that had to be carried more on plot and acting and less on car chases and special effects. But keep the pause button handy as you will need to stop the action and ask others in the room for clarification on what is being said and done - I say that in a good way in that the viewer will second-guess the anticipated outcome."
5,"scary and moving, with lots of creepy critters!","Who can't love a book with scorpions and tarantulas and snakes? I especially loved the opening. It had me completely intrigued. This, if done the way I envisioned it while reading it, will make an enormously entertaining movie. It was very emotional and creepy, with great detail and three-dimensional characters. Much better than the Regulators, which I don't even care to finish."
5,Absolutely fantastic !,I've read almost every single book of Stephen King and I can frankly say that Desperation was the best of all. A town can't be described more fantastic than Desperation. And it was pretty gory as well. If you like blood then Desperation will be the only place you would like to be in.
4,"Pretty Good, but not the best!",This book was interesting to read. It kept me wanting to find out what will happen next. This book is recomended by me.
3,Great story but poor Kindle quality,"Loved the story, loved the characters.Lots of periods where there should not be one. Lots of misspelled words."
5,One of the best of Stephen King's works!,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. Do not go to bed alone. You won't be able to sleep.
4,Terrifying with a climax,"The story starts in an only too real setting, driving trough Nevada on the U.S.50. There they are stopped by a cop, except it's not just a cop anymore... The early chapters detail the effect of the encounter for each of the persons. I could not wait to read the next chapter (normal reaction when I'm submitted to Stephen King material).The last chapters, the story was maybe a bit too bloody / weird. By keeping the bad guy a bit more realistic it would have been even more scary.A book one should read as a King fan, if you have no caridac problems"
5,Read it Again and Again,"I have started to read several of King's books and found myself stopping 300 pages in. Personally I put Desperation down as one of my favorite books of all time! It's dark, methodical and entertaining. The usual backstory (flashbacks) in King's work are a bore to me, but not in this story. Overall a creative piece that comes together beautifully at the end."
1,Has he lost his touch...?,"OK, let me put this straight, I didn't think this was a bad story. But I didn't find it as astonishing as I usually do when it comes to King's books. To be honest, I haven't really liked any of his novels since Needful Things. But still I read every single one, as soon as they come out, trying to find that old KING-feeling, but...Read Dean Koontz instead, at least he's still got the touch..."
4,"Back to King BASICS!!! (Much better than ""The Regulators"")","FINALLY!!!! He gets back to the style that made me start reading him 15 (!) years ago.A great read. Like every one else (almost) has said. Classic King with the battle between Good and Evil.My opinion: SKIP the Regulators. ""Desperation"" is a better, creepier story line. I went out a bought and read ""The Regulators right after reading ""Desperation"" -- the juxtaposition of characters was confusing and a big let down."
2,Really? I was kinda disappointed.,"This book started out with an incredible sense of creepiness and dread, but it fell apart for me when the mystery of it all was reveiled. I had the same reaction to Insomnia. This book also has heavy religious overtones, which may not appeal to everyone. For me, The Regulators was a tighter (if more brutal) novel, and a lot more fun."
5,Desperate? Scared is more like it! TAK!,"Two words: Scary book. I now doubt if I'll ever pass through the state of Nevada, and I will certainly start shaking the next time I see a cop like Entragian. This is my third King book (after The Stand and The Regulators), and I must say that I'm highly impressed! This book started off seemingly predictable, but it only took a chapter or so before Peter and Mary Jackson's fears of the local law from Desperation, Nevada started becoming chillingly real. Next, meet the Carver family, your average all-American gang. They too get swept up by Desperation's evil, and soon you will too. To put this book down before finishing it will give you a serious case of insomnia. Get ready everybody, this one's going to be a New Line movie, and I can't wait! As a final point, I'll quote Collie himself: "" I'll tell you one thing, Carvers: when you've got a nutty cop on your hands, you've got a situation."" He's not kidding!"
3,"A better title might be ""Tak en Dak""","Overall this novel was pretty good, but not King's best by far. It has a similar theme to The Stand and an even less exciting plot line. By the end of the book, I was so sick of certain characters that I just wanted them to just go away -- especially that ""shitty little prayer boy."""
1,It was definitely King's worst attempt ever.,"I can't believe that the same person who wrote The Shining, The Stand, Needful Things, and The Green Mile could write something so....utterly stupid. This is by far his worst work, besides, oh maybe, The Regulators?"
2,Disappointment,"I will admit I read this book avidly cover to cover in two sittings. It is compelling and suspensful, but that's all.It is far from one of Mr. Kings's best works and the characters are cliche and of a formula tht can be found in dozens of other horror thrillers.There is a powerful religious theme to the novel that may offput some readers. The real source of disappointment is the lack of an identified villain and a plot that spirlas down to a weak climax and explanation.The book becomes very predictable toward the end and loses the power and suspense it delivered in the beginning.I received this book as a gift. I think I would feel a bit cheated if I had purchased it myself."
3,Desperation,Stephen King is fantastic. I also recommend the book The Regulators. Desperation is the sequal to The Regulators.
2,"Decent, entertaining but not his best","Latter era King often lets me down..(think Gerald's Game, Wizard of Glass-we waited years for THIS? ) but on the other hand we have Bag of Bones, an excellent read. Desperation is a good read, but....I felt let down when the book ended. He could have done so much more...The end was relentlessly cornball, yuck.Also, why does EVERY CHARACTER SK writes have to either a writer or a teacher? Variety please.I think maybe King's prolific self is his own worst enemy. A good editor could turn good into great if they dared to edit the King.Reread the Stand or It or Insomnia instead."
1,Too many pages of pro-American crap,"In my lifetime, I have enjoyed more than one novel by King, but this one surely doesn't belong to the category. An easy, straight-forward horror story could be very entertaining if the man wouldn't load his storyline with religious righteousness and general pro-American crap. Also the book goes on much too long, given the amount of ideas it includes. In the end, King's black-and-white goody-goodness really started to piss me off. Blah."
5,One of King's best!!,"I typically don't write reviews, but this book was so good that I felt I just had to. I have always been a stephen king fan. I started reading his books way back in high school...Carrie was my first stephen king book and I was hooked immediately. I kind of fell behind due to work, college, etc. Now that I am retired and a recent receipient of a smart phone with a Kindle app, I have been getting caught up on reading his books. This book is one of his best...I read it 3 days!!!! I also highly recommend his latest book, 11/22/63."
3,"A good, but practiced plot","I have read all of the King books, and enjoy each one of them. This book however, has got to be one of his weakest. Since employing the good group of losers against the most hallowed forces of evil in The Stand, King rejuvenates it weakly here as he did in The Regulators. I saw the end coming a mile away, maybe because I had seen the rut before I fell into it."
4,"Desperation, a chilling nightmare. Wonderful!!!",Stephen King is always a powerful writer and this book is no exception.It is guaranteed to keep you up all night and occupied all day.You will scream silently from every page you turn.
2,"Should be called ""Depression""","In my opinion, this book is a bit below average for StephenKing. It reminded me of his short story ""Rage"" in itsfeeling. None of the characters were particularly likeable, which is unusual for a King novel. I'm interested to see what ""The Regulators"" is like - King's pseudonym always seemed darker to me, but ""Desperation"" was so black I wonder if he's switched personas with Bachman?"
5,Wow,I have read alot of Stephen Kings books. This is by far the best it hooks you and you want to know just what happens next. It twistes and turns throughout the novel with suprizes around every corner.
2,::yawn::,"Blood. Gore. Death. I read this on Halloween and I wasn't scared, nor did I really care about the characters. I was kind of hoping for that kid to get his head bitten off by a coyote. The story would have been much nicer if it had been the odd sheriff vs. the innocent bystanders, instead of Tak vs. God. That's hardly a fair fight."
4,"Chilling, Entertaining!","""Desperation"" is a real thriller. DO NOT READ ALONE IN THE HOUSE! I couldn't put it down."
2,It's Fiction,"Ok, so you want to see a computerized matchup of Rocky Marciano fight Muhammed Ali, or How about Babe Ruth hit on John Smoltz, well that is pretty much what you get here only with the NFL. A fictitous story that can not replace what makes all sports worth there true value, the human spirit. I guess if your a real fan, and you want to go on an imaginary trip on what ifs, I think a better solution is to throw on a Monatana Jersey, and place a few Packer Jersey's on your kids, and see if they can stop you. jk."
4,Good book - requires some sewing skills,I bought this book thinking it would be good for a beginner like myself. I soon found out that it assumes you already know basic construction. With that in mind I found it useful once I learned the basic contruction technique for a given garment. As a beginniner I still struggle with it though. I think its better suited for the more advanced sewer.
3,Think twice,"The title might lead you to think this is a way to sew like store-bought, with tricks and tips to do it all faster and better. Not! With the cost of her patterns, the double and triple sample make-up before you actually cut the fabric you wish to make an item out of, this is only for emulating stores where clothes cost the same as my car. There are helpful tips and tricks but they won't make anything faster or easier; they probably will make the end result better, however and that is worthwhile."
3,Brief n' tasty like a chalupa,"I'd give this higher marks but for the price... is a bit high for 10 minutes of music. But if you're using Amazon to buy your imports, you likely don't care!Here Chris Jeffs continues his series of short singles, this one being similar in tone to ""Rewind,"" and ""Living In the 1980's."" The title track is pleasantly cheesy -- especially the mock 80's hip-hop lyrics -- and obscenely catchy. The other two tracks are basically throwaways with the same Robby-the-Robot-on-helium vocals.If you like Cylob's more playful tracks, you'll like this. If you're a new Rephlex convert and you're looking for something more meaty/complex (Aphex Twin or Squarepusher for ex), keep looking."
4,Loved it!,"It has more plot twists than a book 10 times the size. It has dated technology references. It has characters launching into explanations of Van Vogt's theories and philosophies. It has retro-futuristic ideas about women and relationships... BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S GREAT! What's the point of science fiction that doesn't at least temporarily ask you to think differently, whilst giving you an insight into how the world thought at the time it was written?"
2,"allegro is great, but this product is not","I ordered a small, which was extremely large on me. However, even if it had fit, I dont think it's made strongly enough to prompt someone to stand up straight. If you do want to try it, get it in a size smaller than what you normally think you would need, maybe even two sizes smaller. I would say to try it out b/c allegro is great with customer service and you can just return it, but shipping is around $8."
3,"Clairol Born Blonde works well, and leaves hair ...","Clairol Born Blonde works well, and leaves hair nice and soft -- although it won't give your hair salon-quality color. As a do-it-yourself kit I would recommend it, but don't expect too much."
5,"Great book, great ending","This book not only kept you turining the pages, but the storyline was believable and very well-written. The book was filled with twists and turns and new information to make the mystery a little more fun. The author kept throwing in great details that never made a single page worth skimming!"
1,Disappointed,"The service by Amazon was, as always, prompt, courteous and efficient. This particular book, however, is poorly written ... a waste of money. It'll go into the giveaway box."
5,"Great combo of the science behind CR and ""how to""","The book persuasively states the arguments as to why caloric restriction is likely to extend human life spans in the same manner in which it extends the life spans of other species. In addition, there's some good stuff on the cellular changes that take place in the body's cells as one goes on a CR diet.One of the best aspects of the book is the flexibility possible with CR - you don't have to put yourself on a quasi-starvation diet to reap many of the rewards of CR. In 6 months, merely by eating a low cal lunch and avoiding desserts, I have dropped from 185 lbs to 164, and have seen my blood pressure drop back into a normal range. This book has been invaluable in changing my life - it gives one a science-derrived motivation for sticking to a diet that's really powerful. I had never been on a diet in my life, and yet I have found a moderate CR diet to be extremely easy to handle. I can't recommend this book highly enough."
4,high-energy Scottish-flavored punk!,"The Real McKenzies debut album has an excellent mix of hard-driving punk with bagpipes, and a blend of traditional Scottish tunes (done their own way! just listen to ""My Bonnie"") with their own compositions. At times loud and repetitious, they are also often tuneful and impressively energetic. It's a good album."
1,Save your dough and wait for an improvement,"I was sorely disappointed the minute I began to play NCAA 2K. As a loyal fan of the EA Sports regime, it is hard to say this but....DO NOT waste your money on this boring game that comes off like an afterthought to the programmers at EA. They must have been distracted with the Playstaion 2, because little thought went into this one. The playability is horrific, and if you stay awake long enough, you will see how long it takes to load up recruited players and/or a dynasty. Stay away and don't encourage this type of garbage to be made."
1,This Game is Unrealistic,"I know, I'm going against the general concensus, but I found this game to be totally unrealistic due to the fact that it is simply too hard. There are four skill levels; JV, Varsity, All American, and Heisman. I found JV to be way too easy, and Varsity to be way too hard. I mastered the `99 version and even played respectively on the All American mode, but this game seems to out of sync. I mean, who ever heard of Nebraska rushing for 132 yards in a whole game, or an FSU or Florida QB going 14-41 for 144 yards and four int's? Even with the cheat codes, it's unrealistic. I am very dissapointed with the 2000 version and would ask that if someone from EA reads this, please lighten up next year on the Varsity mode, particularly with the difficulty incurred when trying to run the football."
4,Ambi,Well I have used Ambi in the past and it was a good price. i have a few scars on my arms that need fading
3,Good Stuff,"I like the size,the display,and the fact it is easy to setup.Bought it here to go on book purchases that I was sending. It was a good price and just plain convenientTo slip into the cart running to Walmart"
4,Read Again and Again,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves this book. The pictures are so detailed, he can alwasy discover something new. When he first read it, we looked for butterflies on each page. Now, he enjoys looking for snails. The text and illustrations make it suitable for much older children, so I know he will continue to enjoy it for years to come."
1,BAD!,do not buy this item...i ordered these originally to save money instead of spending it on the real tiffany and co silver bead earrings..i wore these for a week and took good care of them and the silver rubbed off/made my ears bleed/the backs were very hard to work....dont waste a cent on these!!!
5,ALICE SHARPE'S MYSTERY NOVELS ARE MOST ENTERTAINING,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It was perfect. It was so enjoyable, entertaining, and fun. Alice Sharpe has superb, top-of-the-line talent. I've read several mystery novels by this company, so I know what type of novels they publish. But none I've read so far even comes close to the caliber of Alice Sharpe's. Her mystery novels (and her romance novels, too) are definitely worth a trip to the library. I absolutely love all of her mystery novels, but if I had to say which one I liked best, I would have to say ""Annabelle's Secret"", and this one (""Deadly Inheritance"") next best."
5,Exciting!,An exciting mystery with many twists and turns! My cousins who are age 11 and 13 asked that I put in a good review for this book!
5,dansk Sugar Bowl,"I have purchased the dishes that match, but my local store was out of the sugar bowl and creamer, so I was delighted to find it on Amazon, and it is a perfect match!"
5,Very Nice,"Seems like this album is kinda passed up by a lot of people but it's definitely worth it and, in my opinion, one of the better albums in the Magik series. Flows nicely and has some very tracks that really take me back to when this was made (read : When Trance was good) Track 10 ""Elevate"" stands out to me and theres a lot of other tracks that are very solid. All in all a good listen start to finish. 5 Stars."
5,Tiesto Magik Story of the Fall,This is a great cd from Tiesto. If you are a Tiesto fan this is one of his first albums. It show his greatness as a DJ. I really enjoy listening to it and I'm sure that if your a fan like I am you will enjoy it too.
1,Do not get this book,"This book is a disappointment. There is not an actual review of the subject but a bunch of exercises. If you do not remember or struggle with math, do not get this book."
4,"Fun book, train lovers will enjoy it","Fun little book -- but other reviews warned me about durability with rougher toddlers. We went about a year before our first ""accident"" with this book. The pages are somewhat thick and slide apart, but where they slide apart is only 2 layers of board paper thick, instead of the 4 layers around the outside -- so it doesn't take much pressure from a toddler to pull the glued edges apart and out pops the slider part.I was able to reglue it with good ol' Elmer's glue and it's held up well. the pages don't slide perfectly easy, but hey, it's a board book -- you gotta expect some friction!I feel it was worth the price and my son loves it. Only one page accident and it's been almost two years now, and the book has held up very well. Elmer's glue is a great fixer-upper if you have a problem.Would recommend this book for little train lovers."
2,crooked dominos,"I bought these dominos for my son who wanted them for the purpose of standing them on end and making domino chains. The dominos are very cheaply made and they are crooked and bent and don't stand up well. They are wooden, not plastic and not uniform in shape. Fine for playing dominos, but not for standing on end."
5,great,Always a favorite for a number of games. They are wooden so they are not perfect but quality is fine. love them.
4,Super Reader,"Another competent Batman novelisation, which again suffers from the original script itself. Trying to whack two villains in together in that short a space doesn't really do justice to one or the other, and in this case it is the Penguin that draws the short straw.That being said, the rest of it is decent enough, and you can certainly get it very cheaply now."
1,A bad show.,"Whether you're a Liddell fan or a Shogun fan, a GSP or a Penn, this show sucked.Liddell vs Shogun ends so quick and so anticlimactically.Penn vs GSP is a 4-round beatdown of the same mount punches every round.In fact, without Quarry/MacDonald, there wouldn't even be a reason to acknowledge its presence in a store. It sucks."
4,A Long Awaited Revision of An Investment Classic,"This is the new updated edition of the 1993 classic book on investment. It has been updated to reflect changes in the marketplace. Many of mysteries of investments are clarified, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, futures, options, trends, evaluating companies. The wealth of information is provided in easy-to-understand language. You'll learn how the various markets work, why stock prices rise and fall, and the basic facts for you to gain most from the current markets. The volume features full color graphics and easy to read and comprehend the material you need. Current information regarding retirement planning is included. A great basic guide, especially for the new investor. Worth the price. You'll refer to it often."
4,"Clean, good fun!","This game provides you with a brief respite from the melodrama usually found in RPGs, in a story with more than one refreshing twist. It's the story of a boy coming of age and fulfilling his life-long dream... and taking care of his loved ones under unusual circumstances. The voice acting is very good, the music is very adequate, and you get an involving story that will make you care for the characters, much like one of Katsuya Kondoh's movies. Even if it's on the short side, the innocent fairy-tale take on the story, the subtle comedy, and the beautiful visuals should be reason enough to include this game in your library."
3,Didn't live up,Don't get me wrong I did like the concept of this game but the controls and the way that the story progressed was very difficult to get down. I was waiting for this game to come out and when I picked it up and played it I was really disappointed. The controls were difficult to get used to. I decided to give it time and see if the story progressed any better and that was another disappointment. The art was good and the idea is great but unfortuneatly I can't recommend this for anyone.
4,Give it a look in.....,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but I would recomend renting it before you buy it. The game gives it its all, and it really tries hard to be original, but it has its drawbacks.It IS over too quick. The monsters are sometimes very creative, butt after a while, you begin to realise that the ""150 base minions"" are just the same, with four different elements (water, wind, earth and fire). The story line is original, but you can see the end coming a million miles away.You will probably complete it in under twenty hours, but it would take you a long time to catch all 150 minions! If you are looking for something new, give it a try: it is an original game."
2,Preaching to the choir,"If you are THINKING about a wood stove, and wondering if it is an environmentally correct decision, if there are any real benefits to it, and have a bucket full of money available to you, this is the book to help make your decision. If you are a life long environmentalist who believes in getting off the grid but have a limited income and want practical advice about chosing a stove, used or economical, and installing it in your home, don't bother. I found this book useless."
4,Oh My Lord......,"DJ TIESTO... wow... No one can compare to the emotion that his music brings out in any listener. With Yet another wonderfully stunning CD, he captures the power of what trance truly is. I gave it 4 stars, only because of the perfection of Search for Sunrise.Do not let this CD slip through your fingers!"
4,The product was easy to use. It didn't ...,The product was easy to use. It didn't drip. The smell wasn't as bad as some of the other highlights I've tried in the past. It didn't fry my hair or make it look like a zebra. I'd recommend it to my family and friends.
5,Low key and elegant,I don't wear bobbles and big flashy earrings. I like the simplicity of these small hoops and the fact that I can comfortably sleep while wearing them. Good price too!
5,These are perfect,I like comfortable earrings that I can put in and just leave. These are perfect. They're not in the way and there's no problem sleeping in them. These are great.
3,"The book is nice, but it lacks motivation to its readers","I have been trying to apply the techiques suggested by this book, but the result is less than what it claims. I have to admitt that I haven't trying very hard, but I do try to read at least 1/2 hr. every day for pleasure. The thing is these techiques may be very useful, but it is just very different from the way of style I've been reading. But I have to say that althought my improvement on my speed is rather slow, I am improving. So it really doesn't hurt to give the book a try!"
4,Help yourself!,"I believe this book will help you, but it requires some persistence and dedication. At first, the ideas presented might seem far-fetched and a lot of times while reading the book, I got the idea I was reading a commercial brochure for the Evelyn Wood institute. But I kept practicing and right now I'm reading at 1800 wpm. I'm having a hard time believing it, but it does work. If you are willing to look past some of the more annoying qualities of the book and practice frequently and seriously, you could really help yourself with this book."
2,Dvorak's Muse on Evelyn Wood's Program,"This book made me quite skeptical at first. It made claims of reading speeds in excess of two and three thousand words per minute. After finding out that these speed are only attainable after the overview technique I regained confidence in the book. It contains valuable advice and information on the use of techniques contained within its' covers. The skills an individual can expect to develop from this book are; faster, more efficient reading, higher comprehension and retention, better note taking, and better preparation for deadlines. These skills are essential for any student and individual in a professional occupation. Based on the benefits I have received, I would recommend this book not only to anyone wishing to improve these skills, but also to any educational curriculum."
1,Before you make the same mistake I did,"I bought ""Remember Everything You Read"" and ""The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program"", thinking they were companion books. I checked them out, they are the same word for word.Get ""The Evelyn Wood Seven-Day Speed Reading and Learning Program"". It is the same price (a penny cheaper) and it hardcover, a much nicer book.Unfortunately, after paying return postage and dealing with the hassel, it wouldn't be worth returning this book. Guess my sister in middle school gets a new book."
4,starter,"Just pick up this book last week, simple and yet effective. Within a few hours reading it, my reading speed pick up 60%. I just bought another copy to my friend."
1,"what a scam, chargers don't work at all.","Someone should report this company to the BBB, the chargers I bought do not work at all. Yes, they fit my phone but they don't work. I bought two, one worked for five minutes then stopped working. The other one just never worked at all. I am so angry, I should have just bought from the overpriced Verizon store. I would try to return these chargers but like most people they were so cheap it wouldn't even be worth the shipping cost and my time spent at the post office. Nice scam they have going there. I suppose in a month they'll change their name and continue to sell junk."
3,It's okay...,"She talks a LOT and sometimes hollers during each exercise, and sometimes doesn't tell you how many reps your about to do on each side. The music is really annoying. She also makes it seem very hard, which is a little distracting. I like The Firm videos better. You actually feel sexier after doing the Firm videos, and isn't that kind of what it's about?"
3,"Went in Circles, boring","While the book does contain a lot of interesting facts, the author strays from the main point (Iraq) a lot to talk about the area as a whole. What is spoken about in several chapters could be summed up in one chapter. It seems to repeat the same facts over and over again just to make the book longer.Though I must digress and give the author some credit for making his point that Iraq is an anachronism--something that does not belong in this time period and could have been settled a different way. But I still have to point out that this book was dry and not as enlightening as it could have been. Read a book with more scope, one perhaps about the Peace of Paris and how the Middle East ties in with it. I'm sure there are more than enough."
3,Gloves for Eczema,"For the price, these are all-right. They are a little coarses cotton than what I expected - very loose weave. I cut the fingers out of mine because my eczema is mostly in the web space of my hands & across my knuckles - and for the thick ointment that I use to keep my skin soft, this is an OK product."
1,POOR QUALITY,THE GLOVES ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE MISS CUT. I HAVE SMALL HANDS AND THEY ARE TIGHT ON MY HANDS. I WOULD HATE TO SEE A MAN TRY TO WEAR THEM. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
3,Ok Brush,"This brush is ok, I think it would br better without the rubber cushion, it pulls on my hair a little too much."
5,Luv It!,"This is the best brush ever. I am a woman of color with natural hair and have so many hair textures on my head. On top of all of this,there are areas where my hair is thicker and coarser than others. This brush feels so good on my scalp and is made very well considering others I have bought and broken in the past. Great brush and will buy shampoo brush next. It arrived in the time promised and in it's original packaging."
2,undercounter bottle opener,It is very hard to get a good grip on this unless it is in the perfect location.
2,not good,"the ole plastic under counter is much better, and safer than this item--you have trouble loading the jar in its teeth--and may cut your fingers.not the livelist minnow in the bate box"
5,History of Miami U.,"Due to the recent passing of Dr. Shriver, I was reminded of what a huge fan he was of my alma mater. ""Uncle Phil"" did a tremendous job of researching the history of the university and renewed my pride in Miami. The university has a terrific heritage and it was outlined so well by Dr. Shriver. I especially enjoyed his disdain when the University of Miami in Florida requested that Miami University in Ohio change it's name even though the university in Ohio was founded 116 years before the one in the Sunshine State. I strongly recommend this book to any alumni or individuals interested in learning more about the university."
3,Songbird,"Writing is good. I'm just not into depressing subject right now. If interested in WW II and challenges, you would enjoy."
2,not what I expected,"I am a school administrator and hoped to use this book to help teach kids about how bullying is not exceptable. My disappointment was two-fold. First, I cannot use the book in school with all the references to turning to God and Jesus for answers. Second, I felt much of the blame for bullying was placed on schools who apparently promote more than prohibit the problem. Some of the situations and attitudes are outdated and sterotyped. There ARE people who care and try to stop bullying before it goes too far. Stop the media from producing movies, books, games, etc. that encourage violence. Stop world leaders who blace blame on others because of race and religion. Stop parents from fighting, abusing and setting poor examples. IT's not just the schools' fault. And, we need mor than religion to change society."
5,THIS BOOK OPENS UP YOUR SPIRIT,"This book will open up your spirit. This book tells you how to self-examine your wounds and how to comfort them. Peretti gives a vivid description of his abused and bullyed childhood. Most importantly, he tells how to comfort and seek help for the wounds that have been caused by this problem. It is a must for teachers, parents, pastors, and especially students! As a high school student, I can say that the bullying described in Peretti's book, sadly takes place in the halls of my school everyday. This book will encourage you to become more vigilant of others. After reading this book, you'll definately want to live a more ""golden rule"" life."
3,Reasonably OK,"This product makes some improvement on light scratches, but doesn't work as well as the more expensive concoctions that use the latest nano-technology. This may be a case of ""you get what you pay for"".....There are better scratch remover products out there, but be prepared to pay a bit more. One of the best at hiding scratches was Eagle One NanoWax, which is no longer on the market."
3,"good, but can't recommend for middle schoolers","I definitely enjoyed the clever writing and 3-dimensional characters, but, as a middle school teacher looking for new books to recommend, I have to pass on this one, due to too much profanity and sexual references. The kids will probably find it on their own, through word of mouth references, since it is quite a delightful work (a la the traveling pants books)--- but I can't put it on my recommended list for this age. High school teachers should take a look, though. I enjoyed the story."
3,Finding Cassie Crazy,"Finding Cassie Crazy by Jaclyn Moriarty is story about three friends Emily, Lydia, and Cassie. These three friends go to a school called Ashbury high (private school) don't get along very well with Brookfield high students. At school, their teacher Mr. Botherit assigns them to penpals from Brookfield high to help them understand each other's differences. When Emily, Lydia and Cassie get their penpals they are not at all happy, but as the year goes by the relationship between the students for both school strengthens so much that they start dating each other.Personally I didn't like this book very much, I found it confusing as it jumps from place to place and person to person, however, parts of the book are interesting and quite humorous."
4,Kay's Review,"This book is a wonderful book to read if you have any time to yourself. It keeps you giggling and in happy spirits. The way the book is written is really diffrent. The book is written in letters back and forth between pinpals at diffrent schools. A lot of drama takes place, and many life lessons are learned. The Year of Secret Assignets is a great book for young girls in their teens to read! The book deals with love, friendship, school, and drama! This book is a perfect book for young girls who are on their journey into adult hood! This book reads very fast, and it is also not hard at all to read!"
4,A Fun Read in the popular Letter Book Subgenre,"In an effort to encourage literacy and improve relations between two schools, an English teacher starts a pen pal program between the schools. Three best friends are paired up with three random guys from the other school. Romance, comedic misunderstandings, and a few hurt feelings occur as the three pairs communicate over the course of the year. Moriarty succeeds in giving each of her characters a distinct voice and personality and paces plot developments well as sometimes major events are first revealed in someone else's letter. The madcap finale leads to a satisfying conclusion. Girls of many types, especially fans of Ann Brashares' Sisterhood series, will find this an enjoyable read."
4,good,it was a good book esspecialy for this genera of book. it was interesting. it captivated the reader. the writing was really good.
5,"Great Job, Mr. O......","I'm a big fan of Mr. O'Reilly's in anything he does. This book was very good. Yeah, yeah, a little too much non-fiction thrown in there at times, but overall the plot was thorough and exciting. Like most of us, Bill despises corruption and evil and I think it's perfectly fine for him to write a fictional account of greed and murder. It certainly doesn't make him a hypocrite. It makes him an insightful guy with a great imagination. I see him as a decent, honest man."
3,A schlock masterpiece.,"I bought this book for one of my friends for Christmas, after reading Al Franken's wonderful Lies and the Lying Liars. I was an English major at college and therefore feel qualified in making the following call: This is the single worst book I have ever read.Of course, I have also spent half my life watching Mystery Science Theater 3000, so I also feel qualified in recommending this book. It is so brutally awful (not to mention hypocritical of O'Reilly's anti-violence message - the end sequence is horrifically graphic) that I laughed almost every page. The plot is hamhanded and transparent, but you can tell that he's really *trying*, which makes it even better.If you're into schlock, this book is recommended on the same plane as Plan 9 From Outer Space is recommended for schlock film. Do the world a favor, though, and order it from half.com or something so that O'Reilly's sales rank doesn't get as bloated as his ego."
1,The worst book I ever read,"It's a good yarn and escapist reading, but the tone is meanspirited. The author doesn't like anyone or anywhere. The characters are wooden. He tells, but doesn't show. I live in New York City and his descriptions of the city don't jibe with mine. For example, at one point he says the road by LaGuardia Airport is full of potholes. I drive on that road quite often and it isn't full of potholes and what do you expect from a heavily travelled road. Also he makes Levittown which is a nice little community sound like a slum. I am sure what he says about the politics of television reporting are true but really, bring in the human factor and if the television industry is so corrupt than love it or leave it."
1,"Those Who ""Kissass""","This is Bill at his best, and Bill at his best is like Scooter at his worst. This is Wimp fiction but Bill sure is trying hard, he's got everything he knows nothing about in here, Television, Humour, Truth, Sex, and Justice, read it and Veeep. I prefer the non-fiction Bill stuff at Thesmokinggun because there when you read the Bill quotes, you can feel that they are real, the characters are well defined, and motivated. Only O'reilly fans will find anything of even remote interest in ""Those Who Kissass"" ( Those Who Tresspass)with Andrea the dialogue is alive.Jeff Gannon"
3,MOR Thriller,"First let me get my own bias out of the way, Bill grates on me a bit but then again all talking heads on the boob tube do. I think I'm a bit more moderate than he but our politics aren't so far apart so really I have no particular axe to grind.That aside I found this a reasonably fun couple of hours read, it was certainly flawed but then most second string thrillers are. I read lots of thrillers and I haven't come across one that's art yet.Many of the other reviews here have shocked me, those who say this is the best book they've ever read need to read more. Those who pan it as absolute high schoolish drivel need to check out more thrillers, what did they expect?Finally one axe I do need to grind; I am disappointed in someone so seemingly committed to hating the current culture of sex and violence should have chosen to further glorify it. Not a topic which I necessarily agree with Bill on but hey practice what you preach."
1,Steal This Book,Because it's not even worth the $9.95 that you might be able to buy it for! It's amazing that Bill O'Reilly would actually publish this for the world to see! Does his greed exceed his own self esteem?
4,User-friendly,"O'Reilly's novel is a must have for every political news junkie out there.Because of his experience in the field of journalism, Bill O'Reilly is able to give us a peak inside his world through this novel. He uses his own experiences and problems with authority to describe the manner in which young, trouble-causing ""infants"" are dealt with in the industry."
5,O'Reilly Proves He Can Do More Than Report The News,"This is a ""can't put down"" read with well-developed characters and a pace that keeps you turning the pages. Tommy O'Malley's description of his born-again ex-wife is hysterical and Ashley's romantic interludes sizzle. The only truly ""bad"" thing about this book is it ended."
5,Who is Coming to Our House,This is such a great beginning book for introducing children to Baby Jesus. My two little grandsons have loved this book all year long since their birth. Only the last two pages hint at Mary and Joseph and Baby Jesus. The rest is all about animals and a mouse in a barn getting ready for someone coming.
1,Full of useless forms and white space,"I bought this book hoping for useful ideas and a few practice development forms. Instead, the book is a set of wasteful forms, questionnaires, and the like that a 10th grader must have created. It is a waste of time for anyone with their own word processor."
4,easy to use for boys,"he loved getting the box in the mail and was very excited to carry his potty around the house. At 2.5 years he is using it frequently, but not everytime. It is good for boys particularly- the shape helps to keep the pee in the pot. It is hard to empty into the toilet tho...if only the bottom dettached for easy cleaning!all in all it has been a success for our son."
2,Disappointing,"We tried this sauce because we love the raspberry sauce served on so many desserts in restaurants these days. We had used another brand before but could no longer find it, so we searched the Internet and found this one. Unfortunately, it was more of an excessively sweet jam/jelly than a smooth sauce. One taste and no one would eat it. I tried using it in smoothies and it made the whole thing too sweet, even though I didn't add any other sweetener.If anyone knows a good raspberry sauce, please let me know!"
2,No good as a TV.,"Note: contradicting Amazon's title, this is NOT a TV. It is a monitor with a built-in TV tuner (lots of differences). Thus the low price.I bought this item from J&R; Music via Amazon.com. I returned it becuase the volume went from off to fairly loud with no ""in-between"" as I adjusted the volume up from zero. Note that I bought this to use as a TV, not a monitor.Well, They sent me another and it had the exact same issue. Also, not being a TV, this has no Closed-caption feature or other ""taken for granted"" TV features you would get in an actual television. SVA and J&R; Music both emphasized this, though I see Amazon still has not changed it (I notified Amazon.com in January, 2005)."
1,I had a lemon,"This tv looks great, good sound, but for the hour it worked I found the picture a little dark, I adjusted the brightness and contrast, still not to my liking. Maybe I had a lemon, it worked for about an hour, then it froze in the menu. I had no recourse but to unplug it, wait a few minutes and then to plug it back in. After that, the tv was dead, I tried leaving it unplugged for an hour but that didn't work. Power is definetly going to the power supply because a light is on on the power supply but the tv won't go on. I will return this tomorrow, I just purchased it, but I won't replace it with the same brand because I when it worked, I thought the picture was a little too dark."
1,Huge let down,"I was extremely disappointed with the illustrations in this book. The artwork is amaturish at best. If you are interested in reading about heroines in sci-fi/fantasy then pick it up, but if you are looking for a good fantasy ART book then don't bother with this one."
1,Tribute???,"This DVD was intended to be a ""tribute"", but I would have to say that after reviewing its results, I found that the actual motive for issuing this video may have to be called into question. The video quality of the film was less than satisfactory, in particular the excerpt taken from Gounod's opera ""Romeo and Juliette"". Other scenes from ""La Boheme"" and ""La Traviata"" were somewhat better, but not by very much. Perhaps, the age of the original tapes contributed to the low quality, but if that were the case, a precautionary note should at least have been included on the cover of the DVD. As an Anna Moffo fan, I was extremely disappointed."
5,I wish I thought of this,"I recently ran into the inventor of this product at the Greater Philadelphia Home and Garden Expo, and he was such an inspiration I had to buy his product. What can I say... It flat out works! Great idea, Great guy, I wish I had thought of this!!!"
5,The Starters Orders!,This book is very interesting it covers all the subjects you would most commonly want to know and more! The author is obviously experienced at the 'art' of horse-racing and so it makes an enjoyable and in some places humorous guide to the logic of racing-well done!
4,Maybe this time I'll win...,"At last, a book on handicapping horses which doesn't sound like it was written by Ma and Pa Kettle. Mr Jones has tertiary qualifications in Statistics (as I recall) yet manages to not bore. The only problem with the book, as a reader in Australia where all racing is on turf and where sprints require more than just speed, is trying to filter out how much of the speed factor in it is applicable to conditions way down under here. (If other readers want to email me to discuss the ideas/problems with the book, please do so.)"
2,reads like a legal document,"The book reads more like a dry legal document than a helpful consumer friendly book written with checklists and perhaps a simulated negotiation indicating what to start out looking at first, must have's vs nice to have's in a lease (based on realistic market conditions), etc. The book is more appropriate for real estate agents than a small business owner about to sign a lease. Maybe its a 5 for a commercial real estate agent but a 2 for a prospective tenant"
2,For agents,This book is great for Commercial real estate agents who will be in the business for a long timeand need to get off to a good start with more training than the basics.
4,"good, all around information straight from the source","This is a worthwhile volume to have on your shelf. complete with stories, folk tales, and factual information presented in a straight-forward approach and written by Native American authors, it gives a good look into culture not only with the subject matter but the ways in which it is approached."
5,Best Lucado book EVER!,"Wow, what an AWESOME experience to read this book. I couldn't stop reading, and then I would go back and read some parts again and again. This has to be the BEST book Mr. Lucado has written.I read this book while a friend was dying. It couldn't have been a better time to pick this book up and read. It gave me so much joy and hope for my friend that it didn't hurt so much to watch her go. It didn't take away the missing feelings, but it satisfied my urge of wanting to keep her here.I cannot wait to meet Jesus! It will be an awesome and joyful time for all of us. Thank you Mr. Lucado and God Bless!"
3,Walk yourself fit ? hmmm not walking.....,"it is more cardio, the routines will get you heart going. Her cues aren't perfect but she goes through everything enough times that you pick it right up. I bought this along with Drop it in 30 in 2007, my only major complaint is her warm up does not correspond to the muscle work out and her cool down is horrible on both DVD's"
3,Pat Metheny Elevator Music,"I have been a long time PM fan going back to the original release of American Garage. At some point I think I even managed to hear PM playing when he was a music student at the University of Miami. His music has been a great inspiration for me in my life. Until this CD, I had never found a PM release that did not do something for me. While there are echoes of PM here this is really PM light. It would make great elevator music as it is very relaxing but there is no emotional involvement here. There are so many great PM CD's out there that this should be last on your list."
4,"It's ""Frankenhooker"" For The New Millennium!","I showed this movie at a party and everybody loved it! Thanks to the twisted sense of humor of John Bacchus and the incredible performace of actress Darian Caine, this film goes way beyond your average ""T&A"" fare. It's funny, sexy, and full of all the stuff you want to see. ""Frankenhooker"" is one of my all-time favorite films, and this really reminded me of it. Side 2 of the DVD contains a lot of outtakes and ""making of"" footage, making it well worth the low asking price."
3,"a well composed,(although lengthy ) abstract of past/future","As an Electrical Engineer, I found this book to be a learning tool in the areas of non-fossil fuel power.Should be required reading for undergraduate science majors.S.J. Clarke MSEE"
4,Entertaining commentary on Genesis,"God's sense of justice evolved over time...pretty hilarious theme to a guy who grew up reading the Bible literally and scratching his head over some of the perceived unfairness of God's actions. I didn't enjoy Dershowitz looping in the Rabbinic tradition into his analysis, which is the only reason I didn't give this book five stars. Is God fallible? Does he make mistakes? If the Bible is your source of divine inspiration, and you want answers to those questions, Dershowitz's book is a good read. Or if you are a Christian and don't mind having traditional views of Genesis and God challenged, this is a good book. If you want to be entertained or enjoy scholarly debate and analysis, this also is a good read. I suspect that fundamentalists will be put off by Dershowitz's commentary."
1,Save Your Money!,"This book has a great title but little else. I was not inspired and learned very little from the book. Based on this book, if I were responsible for Harvard's AMP Program I'd be distancing myself from Mark Stevens.It's a better investment to spend your moeny on a bag of jelly beans than to purchase this book. Can I have my time back that was wasted reading this book?"
2,Wyoming Why?,"Bought this book for a recent trip from Boulder, CO to Yellowstone. Thought I would want to find something to look at along the way. There is nothing there.Ok, almost nothing. There was a nice Thai restaurant in Rawlins, which we found by driving around in Rawlins, but that is pretty much it between the entrance to Grand Teton park and the Colorado border.The Grand Tetons, Jackson, and Yellowstone are great. The red rock vistas are pretty. But there is nothing worth seeing on the way.So, if you are visiting those parks in the west, get some books on those, but don't bother with this."
5,Perfect size and improved performance!,"I bought this wire set with Bosch (4505) HGR8DQI Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plugs for my 1999 Ford Taurus.The wires were exactly the same size as the originals. Replacing the wires on the back of the engine requires some patience, but fairly easy to install.First time I replaced my spark plugs with the wires. Took me a total of 1 hour to do it all.Also, from a previous comment about the dielectric grease, this wire set already comes with the dielectric grease installed. I bought it just in case from Autozone, but had to return it, since there was no need to apply any more. This is ready for installation!!I highly recommend this item!"
2,The history of evolutionary thinking,"Contrary to what is being advertised, it is not mainly a book about a new theory of evolution. It is above all a book about the history of evolutionnary thinking, endlessly recounting its major events and disputes. Don't expect any more a synthetic introduction to what is known on homeobox genes, though the book jacket says it is central to the new theory."
5,Excellent overview and synthesis of evolutionary thought,"This book gives a thorough and accurate historical summary of the development of evolutionary thought from the earliest anatomical studies to relevant studies from modern molecluar biology. In the course of doing this, the author evaluates the validity of the information in the literature and how it has been used in the past.With this solid base, Dr. Schwartz develops an argument for the critical nature of changes in regulatory genes as the crucial driving force in evolution and uses this approach to support the theory that sudden ""jumps"" in the evolutionary process lead to new species rather than a gradual accumulation of small changes over long periods of time.The hypothesis proposed by Dr. Schwartz is eminently reasonable and provides an important direction for future research. The book will be useful to both the professional student of evolution and the general reader who has an interest in this field."
2,Tedious,"""Incredible"" I saw one review describing this production. The meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is NOT incredible. It is slow, convoluted and uninspired. No chemistry exists between the actresses, with no connection to the audience, and the diologue was disjointed.If you want to see brilliant women acting on a stage, rent or buy ANYTHING by Kathy Najimi and Mo Gaffney."
1,Capital BORING...,"What were those people who gave this 5 stars watching? If you want to see two people jabbering for 80 minutes this is it. This was adapted from a play, but still... This would be an ""F"" in any High School play. I want my 80 minutes and $20 back."
2,Very disappointed!!!,"- Very unprofessional layout- Full of spelling mistakes- Full of grammatical errors- I will only pay at the most, $5.00 for this book!!- This book doesn't inspire confidence- Don't waste your money/time on this book."
1,Certified Nurses Assistants State Board Exams,"This book is very, very badly written. Countless obvious misspellings and confusing answers. It needs a good editor to correct all mistakes. Written as if consciousness of continuity is non existent. Such mistakes and errors make the book questionable especially if it deals with answers for a State Certification. Very cheap overall."
4,In my opinion,"I think this book is very helpful because it shows in detail just how to braid, roach, and generally care for your horse's mane and tail. I would recomend this book to anyone that is a first time horse owner."
5,Excellent Production!!,Nice job to the KOC guys. Excellent production. Good DVD menu and some nice fights. Excellent transitions and camera work. Very impressed. Better quality than the Caged Kombat 5 pack but I am glad just to see any MMA videos on DVD so I bought them both.
4,At the Crack of the Bat,"Lillian Morrison selects 44 poems written about baseball written by unknown writers to famous writers. Her choice of poetry is inconsistent, but provides a great book for baseball and poetry fans."
5,"It's not that hard to ""Let it be easy""...","I loved this book. I litterally finished it the first time in about 2 hours. I just read it a second time in about an hour and a half. It's a wonderful reminder of how great life really is if you just take the time to pay attention and be gratefull for all that you have in life and of course ""Let it be easy"". This is not a book that is going to cause you to go from being completely lost to ""enlightenment"" (or perhaps it could) however if you would like a simple book you could pick up anytime and just start reading to really feel good about yourself and life or even to help you get back in touch with your true self I highly recomend this wonderfully simple yet very powerfull read. You won't regret it."
2,overpriced,"You can't go wrong with Delroy Wilson, the King of Rocksteady. Buy all his albums. You can skip this one though. At nearly $65.00, this collection offers nothing that can't be found on other albums. Two or three Delroy Wilson collections will not only cover the same ground, but will include tracks not featured on this 2 disc set."
1,This book's gross exaggerations give it its charm!,"Caroline Cooney has done it again. This time, she has presented an unbelievably exaggerated portrait of Victorian women and family life. There are some tiny kernels of historical truth here and there, but that's it. Despite what Caroline Cooney says, there certainly were women journalists in the 1890's! (Thus making the line: ""Why a woman in New York was writing articles for a newspaper just as if she was a man!"" completely inappropriate for the time period)And it was not rude to refer to having female children. I know this because it was mentioned in Edith Wharton's ""The Age of Innocence"" without anyone gasping in shock. (And Edith Wharton was really there in Victorian times. I truly doubt Ms. Cooney was) I could write forever listing all the inaccuracies in this book! But as terrible as they are, they also make the book terribly compelling! No wonder it's so popular!"
4,This is okay,"When I first read about the third book in the Time series, I was so excited. I was thinking that, somehow, the author would get Strat and Annie together. When I found out I was wrong, I was depressed.I understand that it's kind of impossible for those two, but come on. Since when is time-travel the most realistic storyline? I still think a story about Devonny and Todd should be okay (I have only read the first few pages of Prisoner), but I'm still hoping for another about my favorite characters, or even all four of them.BTW, does anyone know if this is going to become a paperback, like the other two are?"
3,Marshall Fine,"Regarding Marshall Fine's comments about Alvin Lee's playing, all I can say is that he is insane or lying. Alvin Lee is one of the best guitarists in the world. If Mr. Fine can listen to Alvin Lee's ""Good Mornin' Little School Girl"" and not be moved with awe, he has no soul."
3,Don't expect much,"I was looking for an inexpensive steam loco for my grandkids to use. I ended buying two. This one and a Life Like 0-4-0. While I have no complaints on quality of this loco it leaves much to be desired in the pulling capacity department. I can easily pull 20+ cars with the Life-Like while this loco starts to struggle around 6 or 7 cars and at 9, it's about maxed out. I'm sure the problem is a lack of weight in the engine and the wheels spin. Life-Life gets beyond that by using traction tires on the driver wheels. I know that's not ""accurate"" to some purists but then a purist probably isn't going to be interested in purchasing a 60 dollar steam loco anyway."
3,Images of the Deep South,"While this is a book that evokes images of the deep South during the 1950's, it's message spans time and place. Typical Southern characters are described in detail, giving the reader a sense of actually being inside their surroundings as well as being inside their minds. This is a novel that describes coping with whatever life hands you and using it to become stronger. The main characters overcome their adversities and grow into positive human beings. The reader's empathy is elicited and a warm feeling evoked. By the end of the book, you feel glad that you read it."
2,disappointed,"Why do they call this a ultra-compact camera? I was really disappointed when I open the box and found out how large the camera actually is! It's twice as big as my old one, which I'd wanted to replace, and while it's lightweight, it's awkward to hold, and the lens covar is difficult to slide. I don't know if it takes good pictures, but the size is terrible. These days people expect small. I'm returning it and buying one that I know is small, yet still has all the great features, the Fujifilm Zoomdate 1300."
4,Cutest Scenes,"I wont bore you with a long review, suffice to say that the 'sleepover' section was undoubtedly the most titillating for me, not that the acting was top notch, is just that the scenario is rarely seen in films available in your local blockbusters! so a certain forbidden quality shone through with a little semi genuine innocence rapidly turning into full consent coercion by the young but wickedly intenioned mother"
1,A complete waste of time,"This could replace 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' as the worst film of all time. There's more action on Ally McBeal than in this amateurish effort. The girls look like they are the mothers and sisters of the stage crew, the men are just embarrassing. Save your cash, there's much better stuff out there."
2,Nice product but poor decision on glass wrapping,"I just received two of the Sports Flag frames. For some reason, the supplier covers the glass with a plastic wrap which causes the glass to have an etched appearance (scratched) when the plastic wrap is removed. The etched appearance is not removable with any type of glass cleaner. The plastic wrap appears to have a chemical on it which causes the glass to become etched. I was going to return both products but went to a local glass store to replace the frame glass. It cost me $40 to replace the glass in the two frames. I would recommend the frame but suggest the company find a better way to package the product. The frame was affordable until I had to disassemble the frame; buy replacement glass and reassemble. Too much work."
5,GREAT message!,"This book has a simple concept, but it made a profound affect on me. I was starting a new business that required me to step outside my comfort zone ALOT! I am very analytical and the thought of not having all the answers up front was almost paralyzing. The message this book gave me was to be tactical. If you plan indefinetly, and research to the enth degree, and never put your plans to action, how do you know what works and what doesn't. No amount of planning can predict 100% of outcome. Mistakes are lessons...learn what works and what doesn't! If you are learning from your mistakes, they are not failures! The most successful people in the world made mistake after mistake, until they figured out what works for them! Go for it! It will be okay, and it might be GREAT!"
5,A different take on failure,"Well I was stumped. My perception of failure made a complete 180 after reading this book. It's very rare for people to look at failure and not see it for what it is, subjectively of course. John Maxwell's book however changed that for me. He has a lot of good points about changing your outlook in life and in making mistakes. Instead of ruminating on things you weren't successful, change your perception.His book is similar to other personal development books like Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, James Allen, Oswell, Oswald Chambers, Orison Swett Marden, and many other progressive thinkers.This is a book that should remain in your book case."
1,Please don't buy this....,"I bought this Cable on June 15th 2010 to connect my Laptop and my LCD. But for some reason this is not working. No video and no audio. Then, I got a different cable from my friend and tested with that, it is working fine.That means there is some problem in the cable that I bought.So, I suggest you should not buy this.I am trying to touch base with the seller about this issue.Thanks,SharpSri"
4,Costa Rica Wildlife,This book gives an excellent overall review of the Pacific rainforest and it's inhabitants in Pacific Costa Rica while encouraging the reader to contemplate preservation of the fragile ecosystems. Very readable. I recommend it to interested travellers to the region.
4,"Very,Very Good!","This is one Ramsey Lewis album that isn't overly funky butisn't overly lightweight either.Tunes like ""Spring High"" and ""Stash Dash"" prove that funky grooves can be sudtle and work without alot of blandness.Even if the Barbara Streisand cover ispretty needless ""Love Notes"" will not put off listeners."
2,"Funnier than the original, that's for sure","As a carnival must think hard which attractions are gonna get the boot, the flailing haunted house gets another chance when the guests become attracted to the little monsters inside. The creatures then escape, causing murder and mayhem throughout the park. Better than the original and still pretty wild but, like the original as well, too violent and premature for a PG-13 rating. Pretty entertaining although."
2,TOILET MONSTERS HOSTAGE A CARNIVAL,"GHOULIES 2 is better than parts 1 and 4 it has the toilet monsters taking revenge on Larry and Ned's carnival,but spending time in a haunted house making the costumers laugh at what the monsters do,but at the end the action begins.Rated PG-13 or R."
3,It helped in some ways,"This cd did not work for me to help me quit smoking. I wish it did. I did though eventually quit using another method which worked very well for me. I still used the cd a few times a week in hopes that it would help in at least a small way. SO, I used it, along with other methodology and after about 7 months became a nonsmoker. I can't say that the cd really helped, but I figured it was better than doing nothing extra other than willpower.I would say at least to try it. It might work for one person but not another. People are all different."
1,Torture,This product may have worked if the guy's voice wasn't so nasally and annoying. It was actually distracting. Irritating as hell.
2,irritating voice,"The actual hypnosis part was surprisingly effective for me, but the second time I listened, the author's somewhat nasal voice and vocal affectations began to really irritate me. His voice is just too distracting."
2,ONLY ONE BONE,"Maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to the description, but just so you know, although there are 6 bones in the picture, I only received ONE bone in the mail. The dog liked it just fine, but I wouldn't pay $5+ for it... :/ It didn't even last 1/2 hour for my little bitty yorkie poo :("
4,Thorough introduction,"While there are more recent texts on Internet fundraising, Lake's guide provides a suitable background on the basics. It is fairly useful, especially when read alongside other books such as Warwick's."
5,Sturdy potty and good book,I sent this to my sister who is potty training my niece. My niece who is about 18 months was very interested in the book and was trying to sit in the potty right away.Hope this works for her!
3,simple to clean but not good for boys,I bought this simple potty seat for the no frills simplicity of it. My son (he just turned 3) has a very hard time peeing in it without spraying all over the floor. There just isn't enough room from front to back. He is so embarrassed and upset he refuses to go now. He is not a particularyl big kid - he's just in the 50%ile.
1,9' exhaust fan.,Shipping as promised. Product mediocre at best. Their hype is just that. Product is back in shipping carton where it will likely remain ubtil I can give it away. Found better products for a lot less money locally. Would not buy another product from this manufacturer.
2,Good FICTION,"I first read this book when I was stationed overseas. It really struck a chord with me and many others in my unit read it or made sure they heard about it. The author really seemed to understand the military and the book just seemed right.However, after many years I learned the following. The author was in the military, never in Special Forces and wrote this book from his prison cell in Florida. He also writes under the pseudonyms of Dirk Skinner and Haha Lung. Much like slow dance on the killing ground, they are fun books to read, but are just products of a little research and an artist's imagination."
5,Fun for the haunted holiday,We liked this one. Pretty standard story but a really fun take for the haunted holiday viewing.
1,Be Careful with Minnesota Outdoors!!!,"This has really not turned out well. I ordered, or tried to order, the Alabastrite Bamboo Fountain from Minnesota Outdoors. First, shipping was $30, but I really wanted to fountain, so I said ok. Second, it took a long time to receive the item, and, while they were charging for 50 lbs. worth of shipping, the box weighed maybe 5 lbs. Third, they sent me the wrong item and did not have the item I originally ordered! Then, they issued me a credit of $29.99, but the total price I paid was $39.48! The woman who has been trying to help me is either way too busy or just inept, I really don't know which. She takes several days to respond to e-mails, and I can't find a phone number, or I would just call. I would not order from these people if I were you!"
3,Not bad but you are buying it for Demob,"Yeh not bad but not the greatest collection of Oi either. The Crack are not bad, if you havent heard them they have a very 'Clash' sound about them. Red London will send you to sleep, Splodge come up with a couple of good ska tracks but lets face it, this CD has 'No room for you' 'New breed' and 'Think Straight' by Demob. F***ng classics!Buy it for these tracks only!"
3,"Comforting for the downtrodden, but not inspiring any change","Miss Dew was ordained (excuse me set-apart since women aren't to be real authorities) to a General Relief society Counselor. This was supposed to give single women of the Church a shining example of what an older single woman could be. All I saw was an older single woman with great executive skills but living a very lonely, socially-unfulfilled life. (As evidenced by the dour look on her face when ever I pass by her.) The book is full of advise and ancedotes on how to live her ""Godly"" sacred life--enduring to the end, aging and alone. After reading this book I wept for the Single Women, wishing they had a vibrant, joyfull,powerful, passionate exaample to follow.Most women I know realize we deserve so much more and seek the fulness of God's blessings in the Eternal Now instead of holding to the hope of fulfillment ""some day"" as is her message. She is a great mouthpeice for the men of the Church, nothing more."
5,Jim Reeves,Track Listing:1. You're The Only Good Thing (That's Happened To Me)2. Before I Died3. Little Ole Dime4. There's A Heartache Following Me5. Roses6. Missing Angel7. Dark Moon8. The Talking Walls9. I Never Pass There Anymore10. There's A New Moon Over My Shoulder
1,Save your money for a real book about the Spear,"I am currently reading Jerry Smith's book, that he so highly reveres, and am having great difficulty trying to finish it. Maybe its the typos on every other page or sentences that start ""To save his bacon"". Or maybe its the over use of quotations exemplifying his inability to write for himself. I bought it with the intent to learn about the Spear and its history but most of the book is spent talking about things other than the Spear itself. If I wanted to learn ever minute detail about the founding of Rome I would have bought a book about the founding of Rome. The only redeeming value in this book is that it gives some solid history on everything except the Spear. Get and editor."
5,Great changing pad.,"This is a really good changing pad; it's durable and gets the job done. I did not use the attachment screws that came with the pad because I attached it with Velcro, which works really well. One caveat - my baby uses the little ledge on the side to kick back with her feet and propel herself backward. She hasn't managed to push herself off the pad yet, but it makes diaper changing a little more challenging, let's just say. But all in all, if you need a 4-sided changing pad, this is a good one to purchase."
1,Do not purchase if you own a Tungsten T5,"I purchased the gamecard for use with my Tungsten T5. When I tried to access the games, the only game I could play is SimCity. The other games say they are demo games only and that you have to register and purchase them individually. I contacted the manufacturer of the gamecard via e-mail to try to get the registration codes to unlock the games. Three weeks later they responded to tell me that the gamecard is not compatible with the T5 and that I should try to return it. So now I have one game, SimCity. There is not a warning that the card will not work with the PalmOne Tungsten T5 --buyer beware."
5,Fit and cheaper,Fit in with the set that I got from one of the biggest big box and cheaper. Shipping is fast too. Same product at better price.
5,My first train ~ Great purchase!~,Very fast shipping and great packaging. I bought the train to put in my business window. This add'l train track worked perfectly. I will buy more from this seller.
2,Not the same as pictured,"The picture shows ""Original Texture"", but what was shipped was not the original texture. It is not the smooth, but seems to be in between the original and the smooth. I'm OK with it, but it is not what is pictured."
2,"Well, it sounded fun","This comes with pudding that expired in 2003, and so I had to go get new pudding.It was fun to use, once, and then it just ends up taking up a large amount of space. I imagine a lot of these are in garages and have spiders living in the pudding wells.Don't bother unless you really, really, love pudding pops."
5,It works very well,"I have been diagnosed with diverticulosis disease a few years ago. I then immediately started to take Metamucil to improve regularity. That product did improve my problem but not to my satisfaction. It produced a lot of gas, plus I did not like the taste. Additionally, it appeared to lose its effectiveness with time. Several months ago, a friend with the same problem told me that I should try this product called Konsyl. He said that it was much better than Metamucil. Man, my friend was SO right. This product is awesome. I use it twice daily (as opposed to 3 times for Metamucil) and it works as advertised. I first purchased it at Wallgreens but I recently found out that I can also buy it through Amazon. I highly recommend this product to anyone having regularity problems."
3,To stiff for my scalp,"I'm sure this is a great bursh, bu for me it is too stiff for me. I don't have a sensitive scalp, but I feel like I do when I use this brush . . . I've never experienced that before."
5,High Wife Acceptance Factor,I love my new watch and it has high WAF (wife acceptance factor). For me it is just formal enough for my job in IT and casual enough to wear the rest of the week. As a one watch for all occasions it works just fine. It is a little on the large size but not overly so and the fun of the color switching background is cool.The only thing I realistically wish the watch did that it doesn't do is show the day of the month. But there are a lot of other ways to do get this information so it is not that big a deal.The watch came with the background set to cycle between the two colors. To change to manual switching you need to hold the button down for quite some time and then it is a matter of simply pressing the button once to manually switch between blue and greenish silver. To switch back to automatic cycle mode hold the switch down for a few seconds again.
3,Not quite what i was looking for,"I was hoping for something a little more erotic, and this book almost never says things straight out, the entire book is based on innuendos. the stories are classics, but the treatment of most of these could have been a lot better.My biggest problem with this book is that some stories didn;t even make it to the ""erotic"" level.-Disappointed"
3,Complete Shotokan Karate,"Adequate work on karate that offers little insight above that of the classics written by Funakoshi, Nakayama, Ohshima, Egami, etc."
2,Great Info Poorly Written,"This book contains great information about NFL officiating and Wyant takes you inside to some of the political manueverings in the NFL officiating office.However, this book was poorly written. There were many grammar and surface errors.This book is for hardcore NFL Official fans only, and be prepared for an adventure in proofreading misses."
2,CD Holder,I ordered this CD holder for my office. It's looks great with my modern decor but it arrived with one side slightly squished.
2,It was very confusing,"I never understand when he is dreaming or not. I read one of the reviews and it said that he dreamed of going hunting while he was in the hospital with leukemia, but I thought it was the other way around. I thought he was actually hunting but from time to time was dreaming of being in the hospital with leukemia. Now I am even mor confused than before."
2,I couldn't get into it at all.,"Ever time I tried to read this book I fell asleep, I had to read it for a book report in school in grade nine. Even though I am an amazing English student this book was hard to get into. This book was really boring at the begining and not that good. The story got confusing when it kept going back and forth from the past and present. I think this book would have been better if the W.W Cross Institude was in it."
2,"Looks good, is sturdy, but not very functional","Nice looking and well built, but the tower is too ""tippy"" and the shelves aren't slanted or lipped, so the least disturbance dumps a bunch of DVDs on the floor. The vertical size of the divisions is too tight to easily devise your own lips. It doesn't have slots, so storing DVDs horizontally, so you can read the back and easily extract a single DVD is a pain."
5,Good Songwriting Is Worth Waiting For,"I am so glad to see Edie Brickell back in the music scene again. Her last solo CD ""Volcano"" was probably one of the best I have heard in a long while. But also, it's nice to see her reunite with her old bandmates to put out another great album together. I hope to see them tour somewhere close to me. Go out and buy this record."
3,An Interesting Behind the Scenes Look at Advertising,"This book can be read in two ways:1) the history of advertising in America 2) the history of Subaru and how it handles its advertising.Well written and researched, _Where the Suckers Moon_ is an interesting glimpse at a flailing automaker/manufacturer in search of the perfect campaign to put its products in the forefront of consumer's minds. Even though my own background in Marketing/Advertising is very limited, I could see where problems lay in Subaru's approach. I left the book questioning how Subaru of America has managed to stay in business as long as it has. I think if you are in anyway involved in project planning, marketing or advertising you should read this book."
4,Very entertaining Business/Advertising book,A very entertaining business book. Great insight into Subaru ad campaigns in the 90's. Great insight into decision making and power. I recommend.
3,Essential but flawed,"""Suckers"" is one of the best books ever written about advertising. The only element that stops this book from greatness is the author's pseudo-intellectual thumb sucking and his need to find social meaning in every crack and crevice of the culture.While there is nothing wrong with trying to do either, Rothenberg's analysis is so banal (and now dated) he sabatogues his own narrative drive.When Rothenberg sticks to the story of a failed advertising campaign, the book takes flight. He has a wonderful eye for detail and backstage manuerverings. You truly feel like you are ""in the room.""If you are interested in advertising or pathological corporate culture, buy this book."
3,Value for money,I would have given it more stars but the top wood was a little on the orange side for me
3,"Good, just not great",This version of the Paraframe Mini is a great knife. I just like the versatility of the partially serrated version much better.
1,What a rip-off!,"Only two episodes per DVD? Paramount has released videos overseas with THREE episodes per video,with new filmed introduction by actors like Walter Koenig and George Takei.Paramount really is determined to squeeze every last drop of profit from the fans.Don't buy them.Better to write to Paramount protesting about this exploitation of fans."
3,Interesting thoughts but distracting voice!,"Although I agree with many of the already presented reviews, I must say, Natalie's voice was quite a distraction from the content of the book. Her nasal, New York accent was so strong, I was tempted multiple times to just go away from the book. However, I am glad I did not as there are many things to be learned from her ideas to her life experiences.Still, I would have preferred to have had a trained professional's voice read the book. Natalie's voice was so flat and sounded so bored! This certainly took away from the book."
3,Parts Greater Than The Sum,"I originally saw the movie in a theater back in the 70's. What struck me about it was that it was more a collection of finely crafted scenes and dialog than a ""movie."" Yes, there's Alfred taking pictures of dog poop, the wedding scene where the name of the deity is not said, and Alan Arkin's rant about the murders. For me, the scene that I will always remember is when Alfred delivers the long monologue about his mail being opened."
5,A perfect pitch-black comedy,"By all means get this movie--it's a keeper. LITTLE MURDERS seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle of auteurist favorites of the 1970's, but it has always been a favorite of mine. This and SMILE (which is much sweeter and gentler)are the two best American social satires of the era. LITTLE MURDERS treads the fine line between the surreal, the prophetic, and the familiar with (mostly) stunning fluidity. The cast is wonderful--I have always wondered if Donald Sutherland was spoofing hippie guru Alan Watts in his performance of the minister....Two minor complaints:1.)DO NOT READ THE CHAPTER TITLES IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM BEFORE! They give too much away in a movie that is otherwise unpredictable.2.)No commentary from director Alan Arkin.Great to have on DVD, though. This film has aged surprisingly well."
1,"flimsy, cheapo","I ordered this as Christmas gift last December. I recently gave birth so I couldn't go to the store and bought a gift for a very good friend. When this item arrived, its plastic packaging has crack. Obviously, it was not packed securely. And the item itself is so flimsy and it looks so cheap. Well, I was so embarassed to give this but I had no choice since I had a C section and opted to give the cracked packaged new orleasn barbecue set."
3,Haven't tested it yet...,"I gave this to my dad as a gift. I don't think he has tried them yet, but he liked the theme of them (obviously). So that was cool. But the packaging was open when I received it. The instruments themselves weren't harmed at all, which is why I didn't return it."
3,awesome timing very poor presentation,This was the gift that caused me the most chaos this year. It said expected arival date 12-26-12 i bout freaked but it got here yesterday 12-21-12 :) whew close one. The package has never been opened but it is in very poor quality and presentation.
5,BBQ Set,"Arrived in a timely manner. It was a gift to someone and they seem to be pleased with it. It got to their house before Christmas Eve day, so I am grateful."
5,Fab,My husband loves it so much that he isn't even going to use them because he doesn't want to get them dirty
5,Same as Targets sold at shooting range for much less,"These are the EXACT same ones sold at the shooting ranges I have been too. They sell them for 75 cents each. I got these for 18.5 cents each. Yes they are thin, but they are the EXACT ones sold at range. Good enough for everyone else at the range, good enough for me. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Great valves!,I have used these same valves for 15 years now. I have a 12 zone system and I just now had to replace a few. They use to have them at Lowes but not anymore. I will continue to use these as long as I can buy them!
5,A great product!,We put it together right away and it was more than expected. Can't wait for Spring to put it out in the yard for the birds to enjoy! An excellent product!
2,And So it Ends and Begins.....,"This volume represents the end of season one and the beginning of season two. If you are deciding which volumes to keep in order to not have to bear the cost of all the volumes, this is one that you can safely leave out. The first episode: ""Operation Annihilate"" makes for a passably good action adventure although as a plot and storyline it leaves much to be desired.The second episode which begins season two is the weaker of the two weak episodes. This represents the great horror-writer Robert Bloch's weakest effort as a scriptwriter for the series to date and clearly ranks among the bottom 3 ever episodes of any of the three seasons. Still, we get to see the debut of Pavel Chekhov whose character develops very well over the entire season two. Fret not as the episodes in season two represent the best overall episodes of classic Trek.You won't miss this volume though unless you are a completist or one who absolutely needs to collect every episode."
3,End it now,"It is time for Weber to end the Manticore/Haven war. I suggest that Cachet find the culprit (We know who it is) and put and end to war. Remember in a previous novel, the Queen's brother tells Honor she may have to defy the Queen. Weber has set the stage to end the conflict. I am ready for Weber to move Honor Harrington to Manticore's newest acquisitions and to develop other characters from ""Crown of Slaves"" and ""The Shadow of Saganami."""
2,what an utter waste of time,"1000 or so pages of boring minutes on diplomatic meetings and a detailed account of how many wolkswagens happened to be parked at a particular building at any given time, to (finally) finish in what one could expect as the mother of all naval fights, only for the author to decide that he is going to do EXACTLY the same thing he's done in every other book in the series: Manticore, home of the heroe, wins. Give me a break. The defining moment in the battle is SO ludicrous, that is shaming even in a fantasy book. I want a refund on this one!"
5,Very fast,Very happy with the amount of time it took to get to my home. I ordered and it came the next week. Great!!
1,Does have IRON,"I am giving this product 1 star, it appears to be a fine vitamin, but since it has IRON I feel it is misleading and for me appears to upset my stomach as do other vitamins with IRON."
1,Great product but this is only a 10 serving package. These are normally 30,Great product but this is only a 10 serving package. These are normally 30. There are no savings here. Just get the manufacturers coupon off ebay and save for real.
5,GREAT STUFF,"This is the best stuff very sad I can no longer get it at my local store. Happy to order online it""s the best stuff"
5,Awesome,"This instrument is known as one of the most perfect pipe organs in existance. Perfect because it is housed in an acoustic environment designed to project sound (literally hear a pin drop from one side of the tabernacle to the other). The instrument alone is 11,623 pipes with 5 manuals and sounds like the ideal description for the title ""King Of Instruments"", especially in this recording of some of the greatest French Romantic pieces. They are majestic."
3,A bit bummed by limitations on this program,"I was hoping for something more than a floor plan to 3D generator. I wanted to print out structures in the vertical and I wanted to design some arbors, sheds, and gazebos. Not with this program. What it does it does very well - none better. It is just more limited than I was hoping for."
3,SPORADICALLY FUNNY TEEN PIC,"IF YOURE A SIMPSONS FAN ITS WORTH SEEING THIS FILM JUST TO SEE THE LATE PHIL HARTMAN (RIP) MORE OR LESS BRING TROY MCLURE TO LIFE,ALSO THE LEAD COMES ACROSS QUITE ADAM SANDLERISH, UNFORTUNATLEY YOU CAN TELL THIS FILM HAS AGED QUITE A BIT THOUGH."
3,Our family thoroughly enjoyed this spook on getting into col,"This is a ""B"" movie, but one we have enjoyed over and over. It is human and real. The dream sequences relative to the unique SAT/ACT type questions are alone worth a look for any family who's near sending a child to college. This is a goofy movie, but one to see again and again, especially with your kids if you enjoy a fun, close relationship."
5,A well-crafted fantasy world and excellent magic system.,"This story continues the tale of the Queen's Four Quarters begun in Snyder's ""New Moon."" Enough background information is given, however, that it can be read on its own. The cast of characters are sympathetic and well drawn. You come to truly care for the fate of Oran, suffering under the Silean occupation brought in by the country's own Queen"
4,Great Entertainment for the Whole Family,"These all look great. I haven't watched any of the bonus cartoons, just the classics. The clings are a nice touch, but I'll admit that I was a bit disappointed by the 'snowglobe' since it was just two pieces of plastic stuck together over a Peanuts scene."
3,"I mean, it's the peanuts.","It's the peanuts and it's good no matter how cruddy it looks - but it you have a decent sized HDTV, you're not going to be impressed with the so called ""blueray"" quality. It's just okay, a bit fuzzy, but still a good watch. After all - it's the peanuts.I have no opinion on the audio. Sounded fine to me."
4,Charlie Brown Never Gets Old!,"Brought back good memories from childhood. DVD was clear, packaging was good too. The delivery service was great. I received it when promised. Quite happy with whole procedure."
5,All that we expected,The movies have been everything we expected and we have enjoyed the extra shows that come on each DVD.
4,Nice package of holiday favorites,"My 3.5 year old had never watched the peanuts before, so i thought this holiday set was a nice introduction. They are redone so the colors are quite bright and doesnt quite look how we remember them as a child, but i think they are well done. I actually prefer the thanksgiving one to the halloween ones, as they seem to teah a little about the holiday. Havent watched the christmas one yet. The peanuts are a sweet cartoon, not crazy busy like so many of the current day ones, so im happy with it.I had a bear of a time getting this delivered. I ordered it in plenty of time before halloween but twice the discs just never appeared. Im pretty sure the lasership folks were at fault, as ive NEVER had a problem with UPS and i order lots through them, rarely with lasership. On the third try i got ups and it finally made it, just in time for the holiday thank goodness."
3,Charlie Brown Holidays,"love all of Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Peanuts. when I first ordered this, it was advertised as 4 dvds. arrived and it was 3. to resolve this order, and what it really is, took lots of time. they had to correct how it was advertised, many phone calls, time used, and finally taken care. happy with outcome glad I have it. I expect the description to be what it says, and though it was disappointing, everything was done to correct it. though it took awhile, I finally have it, and what it really is, though would've been helpful to not have this whole problem satisfied with resolution. ultimately, very securely wrapped, and quicker than normal, after right one was sent."
5,Charlie Brown collection,"Both my grandchildren, ages 3 and 5 loved the movies. All three of the movies display the spirit of the season and are pleasant to watch."
5,All of the Peanuts holiday classics,"My wife and kids love watching the classic Peanuts cartoons. It's really a good time, especially as the holidays approach. Plus, my wife wouldn't have forgiven me if I hadn't bought it for her."
4,Childhood Favorite,"I love Peanuts. I remember watching these when I was a kid and I'm thrilled to be able to own them on DVD now. I recommend them to all ages. They don't make stuff like this anymore, IMO."
5,Peanuts Holiday Collection is a Must Have,"If you love the holidays and Peanuts, this collection is for you. It was great watching It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown with friends. It brought back memories of our childhood and of watching these specials on TV. Now we can watch it any time, regardless of the season. Can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas with the Peanuts gang. On Amazon, the product arrived quickly once I placed the order. It was packaged well with no damages to the product."
1,Yucky!,I don't like it when Maisy pees in the potty And the toilet sounds like someone's belly when it flushes!
3,One good Cd out of two,"I was reluctant to buy this 2cd pack because Webster Hall as a nightclub is not good at all. Maybe back in the days, but I would not sudgest anyone to go to that place, specially with the huge selection of clubs in NYC.. but anyways.. The CD: CD1 is OK if you want to go to sleep listening to it. it's a chilled selection that borderlines elevator music. However CD2 is not bad, cool selection of house music.. it does not get roudy at all but it is nice and smooth... and for that I give this pk 3 stars"
3,customer service,This vendor made every effort to make sure that freezing temps before didn't damage this (it has liquids that can freeze and burst the ring seal). Unfortunately when it did arrive damaged I contacted the vendor who promptly reshipped the item which arrived in perfect condition. It is a bit overpriced but what the heck - it's Christmas..
2,I do not like being taken for granted,"I liked 1632 and 1633, and I bought The Grantville Gazette without any hesitation, just on the faith I had in Flint. This is not a book by Flint, but a collection of short stories. While one, maybe two, may be rated good, the remaining ones do not take off. I have been misleaded..."
4,Tang like Metamucil tastes good; but the first ingredient is sugar.,Tang like Metamucil tastes good; but the first ingredient is sugar.I did not realize the first ingredient is sugar; but it tastes good. I think of it as a tang (orange flavored) sugar drink.
2,Nature Study,Not an all encompassing view of local birds. Not user friendly interface.Difficulty in finding specific information.
4,Does the job,"This is a really bare bones, no frills gun. But it's also quite inexpensive. So, if you need a cheap gun for small, infrequent projects, it's perfect.The instructions are a bit vague, and the needle is pretty big. Those are my only complaints. But again, for it's price point, it 's on target!"
5,Great product,"This tagging gun kit was exactly as described, and works like a charm. I use it for clothing that I sell at yard sales, and occasionally to re - tag clothing that I change my mind about and want to return to the store after cutting off the tag. Included are a plentiful supply of barbs and needles. It works well for everyday use, but probably not sturdy enough for commercial use. A great deal for the price."
4,Good product,"This is a small pricing gun, which fits perfectly in my hand. It does a good job of easily fixing labels to products. The blue color is a bonus because it's cute and makes it easy to spot the gun. The plastic fasteners are about 2.5 inches long and the needle is kind of thick, but if you place the label in the right place, any unsightly holes will not be easily seen. I recommend attaching labels to a seam or the tag of a garment. A cap comes attached to a string on the gun and this allows you to cover the needle and protect yourself or your belongings from damage. This cap is really helpful. One downside of this product is the illustrated instructions (drawings), which are not very clear. It leaves me wondering how to change the needle. However, this product comes with one needle already in place. I wish I had known the directions were illustrated before I ordered the product."
1,Quit after 3 uses,Funtional and useful at first but after 3 uses it broke. Maybe someone else might have more luck but for my business purposes it was not up to it.
4,Great Deal,I'm opening a small store and had NO previous knowledge of tagging guns. This one has been great! Easy to use and works with no problems. I use it on everything from Jeans to silk! I've become Tag Happy!
3,Price gun,This item shipped quickly. I have not used it yet. The gun is smaller than I thought it would be.
5,Carl-W Röhrig and Aleister Crowley,"The Röhrig Tarot takes its imagery almost straight from Aleister Crowley's Thoth deck. This is excellent for a new reader; since Crowley wrote so much and so well about the meaning of his deck, it's possible to get his books, such as the Book of Thoth, and apply his writing to the Röhrig deck."
1,Difficult for Younger Readers,I grew up with a great version of Paul Bunyan and His Big Blue Ox. Very easy to read and written in a clean prose. This was not the same thing. This was more of a study of origination of the myths surrounding Paul Bunyan. This would probably be great if you were studying the subject in high school or college. Just not what I neededto read Paul Bunyan to my kids.
4,I love this band!,"Most songs on this disc (Big, Decisions, Happy, Model Family Man), I have on their other discs. I was very excited to finally get my hands on such favorites as Zak, The Rain Came, and Bitterness and Shame. I have seen the band live many times and love their energy and intensity on stage. I do have to admit that some of that is missing on these recordings. But, I still love the songs, and have grown to appreciate them in their more polished forms. Declan McLaughlin had a strong and captivating voice, the horns are amazing and the lyrics deal with current and relevant social issues. I only hope to hear more from these lads in the future."
5,Tools for Schools,This is one of the most informative school choice books that I have read. It contains practical information on evaluating schools. The book is organized in an easy to read manner. The enclosed report card for evaluating schools was very useful for my wife and I. One of the best features of the book is the author's encouragement to define your own goals for your child's education and develop a definition of an educated individual. These activities were extremely helpful when my wife and I were searching for schools for our two children. I highly recommend this book to other parents who have questions about choosing the most appropriate school for their child.
1,MIKADO GO HOME!,"Ever since Joseph Papp souped-up ""Pirates of Penzance"" in the 1980's there has been a tendency by directors to treat the Savoy Opera's as if they were decrepit museum pieces that could never rest on their own laurels. While a fresh new approach to any classic can be interesting, I'm afraid this Australian Opera production is so over the top that any charm goes sailing out the window as soon as the curtain goes up. The sound, as already noted by others, is deplorable. Those wanting to see what this classic operetta is really all about are refered to the beautiful D'Oyly Carte performance from the 1960 also available on DVD. Kenneth Sandford's sneering portrayl of Pooh-Bah and Valerie Masterson's lovely, sweet Yum-Yum are hardly ever going to be equaled."
4,this is a good book to read if your hurt or have a bad injury,this is a good book to read if your hurt i broke a bone and when i read this book i hardly felt any pain because i was so 'into' the story this book isn't the best book in the series but still a great book i hope this review helped
4,gguardians of gahoole the seige,its ok. suspencfulits ok. the suspence is what makes it good.this is the best book of the series i would recommend reading it.
5,Best of the first four books!,"This book is my favorite by far. It is action-packed and thrilling, and this is where the series' plot starts to really kick in. The spy mission was so exciting, and the battle at the end is engrossing. The end is pretty abrupt, and you will want to read the next books. This was a truly exciting book!- A book loving 11-year-old"
1,A recording to avoid,"I'm gravely disappointed by this recording. The staging is stilted and the performances are inadequate. Domingo sings with dedication, but he isn't in his top form. Behrens is woefully miscast as Tosca, for her unitalianate tone, wobbly delivery and, in some instances, thread-bare voice completely fail to do justice to the role.In my view, this is a recording that one should avoid."
5,Charlie Brown's THANKSGIVING,"I purchased this dvd for a niece & nephew for Christmas. I contacted their parents to select a movie that they thought the little ones would enjoy--and they selected Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving. Their mom sent me an email to thank me & to let me know that the kido's loved the movie & had watched it several times already--and the parents enjoyed it too. Afterall, who wouldn't love a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving!!!"
4,One of the best,"This is one of the better Peanuts videos. A solid story, excellent score, not seeming too rushed or too drawn out. Adults can enjoy this one with the kids."
5,Love It!,"Wife and daughter learned about Thanksgiving, ""thanks"" to the Peanuts gang! Absolutely love it and is a MUST see at home every year!"
2,Carl,Price I rite for product but product is not built the greatest but does work. You will likely need to modify it to adapt your strap or bipod.
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,Please do not waste you hard earned $$$ on this. After I was turned off by this thing I spent big bux on the real teal from Harris. It would have been cheaper if I hadden't spent $ onthis in the first place. AVOID...this thing is nothing more than a paper weight.
4,Look great,Almost what I was looking for. They look great and the handles are perfect.Would like a larger size!
1,You may want to look elsewhere,"I have had my taxes done by a CPA for the last few years and she just retired. I've had a tough time finding someone else who could do minister's taxes so I decided to try it myself by buying two books; this one, and Zondervan's ""Minister's Taxes & Financial Guide.""""Clergy Tax"" is far superior in my opinion because it really does literally walk you through step-by-step on the all tax forms in a very simple yet thorough way.Zondervan's book, on the other hand, is why I never did my taxes before -- it gives you theory, and answers some questions in the ""Dummies"" style, but doesn't ever touch down in the nitty-gritty world of tax forms and what goes where on which form."
3,Old favorite,Lots of old favorites. Nothing new. All of the greatest hits included. A good selection if you just want to get some of the best.
1,CD was scratched,This CD was scratched. I don't understand why it's so hard to check the quality of the products they sell on here.
2,Delonghi Cafe Nabucco- the leaking coffee maker,I bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago. Used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner. Unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine. Very poor quality machine .I just threw mine out in the trash bin. Just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it. Don't buy this coffeemaker- a waste of good money( I paid $99.99).
1,delonghi update,Did not realize machine did not have automatic shut off for cappuccino brewing system.....and must manually switch from brew to froth milk...also pot began to leak after two months....
3,You get what you pay for,"I was very excited waiting for this machine to be delivered (bought on ebay), but was very disappointed when it did. The outside quality is very poor and the instruction manual is not helpful. The machine makes good drip coffee and espresso, but making the milk frother work takes time. Also there is an unidentified compartment above the milk frother (not mentioned in the manual but visible on the picture). I still have no idea what that's for. I tried to contact Delonghi Customer Service, but did not get a reply. The plus is that it's easy to clean and it has additional features such as flavor sensor. It's by far not the best coffee maker ever but good enough for the price. The mystery compartment still makes me a little nervous though."
2,Does'nt last,I received this machine 2 years ago. I have been totally satisfied the first year. However I had problem in the past year. The machine is leaking a lot and I'm not able to get more than 2 cup of expresso and it takes forever! I'm really dissapointed.
2,Marginal at Best,I have owned this product for a number of years. Coffee is good. The latte is marginal at best with poor steam performance. Maintenance is impossible - I waited for almost 18 months for a simple replacement part. For $99 you can purchase two Mr. Coffee or Farberware or Krups units.
1,Dont Buy,I bought this product about a month ago because I really enjoy coffee and I thought an espresso/cappuccino maker [...] isnt bad. when I received it in the mail I was really excited. About a week later was the first time that I actually had time to use it. The espresso part of the machine didnt work. The knobs to adjust the how strong of coffee you want didnt turn. It just looks nice in my kitchen. So basically I paid [...] for just a regular coffee maker. It doesn't have a timer on it so when you wake up in the morning the coffee is already ready. It doesn't have anything special about it. This was really a waste of money.
2,Did not work long,Bought this machine in October. 2 Months later it started to leak when I used the espresso. Each time I use the espresso the counter was wet and I had to find out that it leaks through the cable-department. Customer service of De-Longhi was also not very helpful. I am not considering to buy any DeLonghi products in the future.
1,Don't waste your $$$,"This thing is awful, we asked for a coffee, espresso, cappucino etc. machine for Christmas last year, so my grandparents gave us $100 to purchase on because they didn't know which one to get. We didn't do research and thought Delonghi was a great brand, well needless to say we unfortunately blew our 100 on this piece of crap. The directions are SO complicated, we were never able to froth milk or anything all we could do was make a leaky pot of coffee! I wouldn't pay a dime for this thing, it's bulky and junky, splurge if you really want a multi-task coffee maker, just don't go with Delonghi!!!"
4,Good value for price.,"This is a good value for the price. It's fast, convenientand makes great coffee/espresso. We particularly like thebuilt in milk steamer. We also like having the ability tomake coffee and espresso at the same time with one machine.The only criticism is that it has no automatic shut-off.We bought an appliance timer to cover that deficiency.That was the only point that kept us from rating it 5 stars."
4,Surprising but enjoyable if you stick with it,"Okay, I'll admit. I almost put this book down. It began like an erotic novel, the language was surprising for a historical romance, and I felt no warmth for the characters. They basically started going at it immediately, sight unseen, and it turned me off! Yet the book got better, more emotionally involved, etc. It was quite surprising, really..."
1,One Star,"I love a good erotic read, however, there has to be a story line along with it. I gave Passion a re-read, skimming the painful sex scenes, and the romance was just so-so. There was potential but without the heat of the 'love` scenes 'Passion` would not stand out in any way.I felt no love between the h/h and Passion had a doormat mentality. The language was even too course for me, and I consider myself a jaded erotica/romance reader. LV needs to apply the use of a thesaurus on her next efforts. There are other words for the female genitalia than the ""c"" word which was used ad nauseam.Mark, our hero extraordinaire sums the book up quite well when he and his brother have a particularly stimulating conversation. They have a long standing agreement they shall marry any woman who can 'take` the entirety of their massive male appendages. How romantic!For an erotic read hotter than 'Passion` WITH the romance read 'A Lady's Pleasure` by Renee Bernard."
5,OMG LOVED THIS BOOK,"Loved the setting and the sex and the story, and did I mention the sex? Talented author with excellent writing skills. If you like historical erotic with story, this is highly recommended. I don't find that many in this genre that I like. In recent reads, I also liked and recommend Gena Showalter's Lords of the UnderWorld paranormal/spicy (good action and great alpha males; addictive) and Elizabeth Amber's Lords of Satyr, which are erotic/paranormal/historic."
2,Hardly Historical,"If you can suspend belief that in the 1800's the mother of an English Earl eager to marry off her son can drop the F-bomb - as both an adjective and a verb- this book is for you. I had a hard time connecting at all with the story due to the more modern vernacular sprinkled through out except for the laughable Cockney lad (who should have been the one with the rough language) and the ridiculous trysts in the beginning. The sex scenes were hardly tender (a ""popping"" noise ;o( does not sound fun) ...although there was an attempt at the end to be more loving. I was skimming by 2/3's through. Only worthy of some cheap thrills."
1,"I don't like it, it worth less than one star.","For a romance fiction, it worth zero star. For a erotic one, it may worth 3 stars. The story plot is simple but ridiculous and unrealistic, even for a erotic fiction, it still should have a reasonable plot. The H/H couldn't resist each other and mating (suck...) in the public area, for one time its still fine for me, but they performed continuously in the public, it is beyond my understanding. The H/H should have psychological problems; they need help from professionals, even though at that time counselling was not common.Besides, the heroin was too submissive and I don't think what she was doing was accepted in the Regency. The physical description of the hero was too unbelievable, and the character of the hero's mother was also ridiculous.Sexy, steamy or even erotic is fine for me, only if it have a reasonable storyline. It was quite surprise to find lots of 5 stars review, may be I expected too much."
3,An amusing blast into the past,"If the DVD was in stereo, I would have given a higher score.Although this program might be laughable by todays standards, Music Scene provides a glimpse into what we used to enjoy watching on TV on Monday evenings (if we stayed home). Some of the biggest hitmakers (along with some of the biggest names names in show business) were featured.(The styles worn were pretty wild too!)"
1,b- movies,"These movies don't even deserve a ""B"". They are like rejects from the Sci-Fi channel. I would recommend you look for something better to spend your money on."
2,Less lame politics and more aliens getting blasted,The real problem I had isn't about the redemption of the SS its how so much of the book is full of ranting about euro-commies and left wingers who are - for some reason - actively hoping for the end of the human race which includes themselves and their families.If I wanna read page after page of attacks against cartoon character liberals I'd hit the blog circuit. Time to get the series back to the basics. Massive amounts of artillery raining down on aliens; realistic portrayals of people who are not either mad dog lefties or ultra decent upright righties; and descriptions of cool armored fighting suits.
5,Ringo and Kratman's Watch on the Rhine,"This is a book about human character, good and evil, redemption and Desparate Times. The German Chancelor has a hard choice to make, and after what he sees in West Virginia (This story takes place after Gust Front, the first book in the series) the decision to be made is stark, uncompramizing. To survive an alien invasion, he must call up the few remaining SS vetrans.What I liked about the story, is that the authors show how good people could fight for a bad cause, evil people don't see themselves as evil, and how sometimes you have to do what is necessary to survive. The authors do not glamorize, or hide the past of the SS. The Story is riviting, a crackling good yarn. Worth your money.tigertim"
1,This book is absolutely unreadable,"Do yourself a favor, don't read this trash. And I do NOT refer to the book's subject matter. It's simply that this is one of the worst-written books I ever came across. The plot and subject matter could have been made interesting. Other sister-books in the series (Hero, Cally's War) are well written and enjoyable to read. This literary abortion is absolutely awful, could have been the literary creation of an IQ-challenged ten-year old."
5,Awesome!,"I have had this pad for a month, best heating pad EVER. It doesn't shut off on a timer so it will stay on all night long which is perfect for me. Long cord and a big pad, all you need in a heating pad."
1,HEATing pad?,"This thing BARELY works. It's supposed to be a heating pad, right? Doesn't get very hot at all. They should call it a ""slightly warming"" pad. I'd understand it losing some heating power if it were, like, 3 years old or something, but this thing's brand new. Try another product. I wish I did."
1,THE CONTROL BEGAN TO SPARK AND SMELLED BURNT,This item while on my wife began to spark and it smelled burnt. This item was only used a few times. I can't believe that they are still selling this. I began to read other reviews. I see that this is not an isolated case.
4,Simple but exactly what I wanted,"So I searched high and low for a simple heating pad that does NOT have an auto off function. While this one is a bit larger than I was looking for, it works perfectly. Even though the manufacturer tells you not to use this for animals, I use it to keep my 18 year old cat warm in the winter. I put the pad UNDER a blanket and set it on LOW. Check to make sure that its warm and NOT HOT. My cat LOVES it. For safety reasons I suggest not leaving it on all the time."
1,Will not stay flat,"I use a heating pad for my back, this heating pad will not stay flat. It bunches up and I am always having to pull it out and flatten it before use and you can only do that when it is warmed up."
4,larger than normal,"since this heating pad is called ""King size"" i knew it would be larger than normal. It is a bit stiff and I'm hoping it will become more pliable after several uses. It seems durable. It's a different width to length ratio than the picture shows. (narrower and longer)"
2,These Stink!,"What can I say, I can barely feel the heat this thing gives off. I actually bought a two of these to train my cats to sleep in their own pet beds, rather than in my bed, with a new partner allergic to cats. Both of my cats are eternal heat hounds...big time! But these heating pads don't give off enough heat even keep their attention. OK. I know these are really for people, but the only thing they (barely) warm up is the protective cover - LUKE WARM...which is both what I call it... and rate it! Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. The cats and I both gave up on this heating pad."
1,"cheap, not durable","I have a heating pad which works well for more than 10 years. It is made by a different company but has exactly the same function as this one. I think it may be a good idea to get one for my sister. I don't know why other reviews are so good, but mine only worked for about 2 months. :("
3,Actually to large,"I thought more was better, but for most situations, a 12x12 will do as well, and beeasier to handle/keep in place. (This is my fault)The cord is to long.The plastic material is to stiff.The slide heat selector works well and is easy to see.The plastic snap holding the cover on comes unsnapped a lot."
4,It does its job.,I've only had one other heating pad and it was quite as long. So i'd say that this is the main advantage of this pad is that it can cover your back from neck to waist or cover both thighs if need be. Been using it for about a month now and no problems so far.[...]
4,Works well like I expected,Bigger than I thought but it works fine. Kinda big for some applications and harder to store because of it's size
5,"Great Heating Pad, no problems","gets hot quickly, works great, works so well so dont leave on overnight or it might burn you. had for 6months and no problems at all. great product at a low price!"
4,Easy Listening Favorites - Ferrante & Teicher,"Most of the tracks on this album originally were released on an LP entitled ""Out of Nowhere,"" the remainder apparently outtakes not included in that release. Far and away the most unusual album the pair made together, it's notable for a variety of recording gimmicks (including hammering the strings and other sound effects) which strangely suit the material chosen. While it's great to have the outtakes one does miss the numbers omitted from the original and one can only hope that the folks at MCA will release the complete session recordings on an album in the future. The mastering on the current release is excellent."
4,Award Winning Band and Leader,"As a trumpet player,I went to his clinics. I used his trumpet methods for years. Finally I get to hear him play. He was a remarkable trumpet virtuoso, leading a really great award winning band. Anyone who digs a really great band playing some great charts from the 50s, has got to have this CD from Amazon."
1,lights on but no coffee brewing,"Before you think I don't know what I am doing, I know how to reset the brew counter. I re-read the manual and I pushed both the prog and power buttons simultaneously for 2-5 seconds. This worked once before but this time its just not responding. The power light and 5-10 cup light come on. But the coffee just won't brew. No water passes through the system and the hot plate is cold. That's why I titled this ""lights on but no coffee brewing""I liked this figaro machine for all its features. But mine just quit today and I would hate for someone else to have this trouble. My machine is only 5 months old. Come on, it supposed to work for much longer than that. This DeLonghi model is not reliable. You're lucky if you get a good machine that lives past the warranty. Good luck, if you get this as a gift, I hope you have no problems. For 150 dollars or more, there has to be more reliable machines out there! Cheers!"
2,It was good while it lasted,It was great for 30 days. On the 31st day the motor got hot and it just died!
2,Not worth the price tag.,"This is the second grinder I have owned. The first was an old Braun that worked well for years until I lost it during a move. I purchased this grinder because of the seemingly easy to use feature for making coarse, medium, and fine grinds. I was somewhat disappointed when I realized that the difference was only in the duration of the grinding. I was further disappointed when I noticed, particularly with coarse-medium grinds, many of the beans are unground or ground unevenly. In fact, all the grinds are uneven. What I usually get is a mix of really finely ground beans with really course grinds, regardless of how long I grind it. Varying the amount of beans does not improve this. I give this two stars for lack of precision."
2,Loose Grooves: Funkin' Live in England 1980,The sound and visual aspects of this dvd are terrible. It reminds me of a cheap bootleg put on dvd. Buy this video only if you are a real die hard War fan otherwise just listen to their music or wait til they come to a town near you and see them live.
2,terrible sound,"The sound on this dvd is terrible ! I heard better sound comming from my old fisher- price record player form back in the day . If a little money was spent improving the sound it would be a great dvd, because it captures war at there peak. Who ever released this dvd with this low sound quality needs there head examined !"
3,I felt the aroma was a bit strong ...,"I felt the aroma was a bit strong for an after shave. It wasn't at all unpleasant, just a bit more than I'm used to."
5,Fantastic Treats,"There are only a few treats that are enjoyed by both my cats, Feline Greenies are one of them. One cat is very finicky and won't eat most treats, but then again, that is the nature of cats. They get a few as a treat and they LOVE them. They have an added benefit that they are good for their teeth, though it is not a replacement for teeth cleaning. For those that don't know, teeth cleaning is quite important for cats!These treats have several flavors and they are low in calories, so they are a good treat in my book. 5 stars for being an excellent product."
1,Why aren't there any pictures of items?,"Going through your website I am having trouble, because there are not any pictures of anything. I refuse to but anything when I don't get to see the actual product, this is a problem because what I want is on here, I just won't buy it with out actually seeing it. I have high speed internet, some pictures show up, I think you need to update your web page please."
3,"Sad, unfluffed, and lonely","While some reviewers felt no sympathy for the lead, I did. This film depicts how some internalize their fears/ and feelings often times viewed by the outside world. And while the ending was rather abrupt . Enjoyed this film, if your into closure at the end of a film you may be disappointed."
5,Incredible,"Okay, I'm biased as I already thought that New York City was the greatest city in the world, but this series just emphasized it! Unlike another reviewer, I thought the first two discs were the most accesible and interesting... and it made Alexander Hamilton my new hero! I bought this when it was only a seven-disc set and had to order the World Trade Center disc as a seperate entity, and I'm glad it's being sold with the rest of the set. Ric Burns did a fantastic job! A must-own for all New Yorkers or lovers of the Big Apple!"
1,Amazingly awful,"Full of idiocy. O'Ryan (get it, Orion?) jumps on the girl when a grenade is thrown in a restaurant. Sorry, but you have to jump on the grenade to save the girl. You can't just lie on the floor. Grenades are made to fill spaces with shrapnel. It just gets dumber from there. Fusion lasers out of control? Ooh, crawl INSIDE the machine to block them with your body! That would sure work! You could just crawl around and get comfy while they cut you to ribbons. This is the first book I have ever thrown away in my life."
4,"Nice espresso, you get what you pay for.","I got this as a gift about six month ago. I was new in making espresso so it took some time before I got perfect espresso. Now I like to order espresso in restaurants and cofee shops to compare with mine, usually mine is better. I use starbucks espresso coffee, they grind it for me an tastes wonderful. I give 4 stars because capuccinos are not as easy and fast to make as espresso holpfully I make lot more espresso than capuccino. Never have problems with the machine."
1,This is 100% steriotypical rap!,"THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A SHRED OF CREATIVITY OR ORIGINALITY HERE JUST THE SAME PATHETIC TOPICS ALWAYS COVERED IN RAP. WEBBIE IS AN IDIOT! HOW OLD IS LIL BOOSIE, ANYWAY? LIKE, FIVE OR SIX? I LOVE RAP THAT'S ORIGINAL AND THIS HAS NONE OF THAT! I GUESS THAT'S COMMON IN THE DIRTY SOUTH NOWADAYS, HUH?~GERAD DUNN"
2,Smart Cookie setting isn't smart,"The alleged Smart Cookie feature is misleading not smart. This feature is fine if the cookies you are baking can stand the blow torch like heat of a convection oven automatically set at 350 degrees. And no, you can't change the temp. if you use the Smart Cookie setting. The bottom tray baked up fine but the upper tray was scorched on top with raw dough oozing out the sides. Perhaps using the Fan Bake setting and adjusting the temp. is a better option. Otherwise, this is a great looking unit about the size of our old yucky toaster oven. Just don't expect much from the Smart Cookie marketing ploy."
3,Part 2 of Part 4!,"This was shot at the same time as Part 4, so it's pretty much more of the same. The evil underworld Power Rangers demon sends out another Totem to finish the job he started in Part 4. Rick, the new puppet master, once again has to rely on the help of our usual band of heroes to put a stop to it all. Plus he has to deal with a fellow scientist from Biotech(Biotech....Biotech....Biotech....Is Godzeeela!!) who has gone traitor and wants to steal the puppets.It's a continuation of Part 4 and pretty much seems like one long Puppet Master movie when viewed back to back. Not much to say about it that hasn't already been said about Part 4. If you liked Part 4, then go for it.Sorry for saying ""Part 4"" so much."
3,Chronologically ordered,A good chronological account of Hitlers reign with some good footage of the ghettos and the poor souls that lived there. A good video for the novice world war 2 enthusiast.
5,love it thanks,"i loved the movie thanks so much for the fast service and the packing of the movie was great, thanks"
3,Brand Imagery and the Placebo Effect,"Basically what this stuff is, is designer Vaseline. It's the same thing - petroleum jelly.However, it comes in euro style packaging, identifies itself as ""healing ointment"", and sports a label crowing about the fact that it's ""Dermatologist Recommended"". It furthermore notes that it is ""advanced therapy for dry, cracked, or irritated skin"".Wow, bring it on, even though it costs 50% more than a similar quantity of the pedestrian Vaseline brand.Vaseline, after all, is labeled as nothing more than what it really is, i.e. ""petroleum jelly"". Its container looks utilitarian and a bit blue collar. The imagery that's conjured up is all about messy babies and diapers. Amazon has a special offer noting that it's frequently purchased along with a rectal thermometer.Hmmm.So, which one am I going to apply to my aging baby boomer skin? The choice is clear..."
1,Overpriced Vaseline clone,"I can not believe I spent $7.95 plus shipping for what essentially is Vaseline petroleum jelly! Even though there is hardly any odor, what you can detect is it even smells like Vaseline! What a waste of money! I could have bought a jar of Vaseline three times as big for at least half the price! Save your money!"
4,Aquaphor,"I bought this for dressing my tattoos. I'm satisfied with this product. There's nothing bad anyone can say about Aquaphor. You get a lot for what you pay. I paid $8.01 total for this 3.5oz container and they don't jip you. Haha. Shipped normally, arrived in good condition. I'll always buy again."
2,not same as picture,"Product came on time, however the picture shows colorful marbles and ours were plain and clear. I picked this seller due to the colorful marbles...would have ordered from someone else."
3,Mis-leading description of product,"I searched in Amazon for a 1.4 GHz processor upgrade. The Amazon search engine gave me the page for this product, which I purchased. Unfortunately, it was a 1 GHz processor, which was slower than I thought I was purchasing. Amazon displayed a mis-leading description of the product, so I am very disappointed. The Sonnet accelerator product was fine, just slower than I wanted. I would hestitate about purchasing products from Amazon in the future, as it appears they mis-lead consumers so that they can dump discontinued products."
2,So What?,"What can I say about this book? Well, it's probably not as bad as some say but not as good as anything else that's ever been written about Capone. Make your own construction from this but Pasley, Kobler, & Schonberg are far more reliable on the subject."
4,A fascinating tale of American lives,"This is much more than a biography of Al Capone. Bergreen gets right to the heart of the world Capone traveled in with all its duality. You see Capone the Violent and Capone the Benevolent. This portrait is butressed by a thorough exploration of the crime world Capone traveled in.Balancing Scarface's story is lesser know story of Capone's brother, who fled the family, changed his name and became a lawman out west. The comparison/contrast of the two brothers and the lives they chose is a strange and compelling family portrait. The result is a real page-turning American biography.Some minor mistakes on Chicago geography and small historical errors prevent me from giving this 5 stars. Regardless, the writing and the story are compelling. This is well worth the price of admission."
1,Uninteresting!,This book seemed to be slapped together at the last second.The facts well there aren't many!Capone never took orders from anybody after Torrio was gone.He wasn't a cocaine fiend either and his sister Rose didn't die at birth!Author tries to sensationalize.Not many photos either.
3,Okay,"I bought this for my little girl at Christmas, great toothbrush, but you can not barely hear the music. Very faint."
2,packaged like discarded trash!,"I received these ONE-HUNDRED DISCS in a LARGE BOX WITHOUT ANY COVERING FOR THE DISCS. THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED, LOOSELY THROWN IN THE BOX AS SINGLES. THEY WEREN'T EVEN IN THE SLIP COVERS. HOWEVER, THE SLIP COVERS MUST HAVE BEEN MORE VALUED BY THIS SELLER, AS THEY WERE AT LEAST RUBBER-BANDED TOGETHER."
2,Wrong track for my set,"Looks like a good product. This didn't work with the track I have, my mistake. I will se about a return."
2,Great Product//update 6/2/2012 do not give to your dog,The product does what it said it would do! I have a minature schnauzer-she loves her new treat and I don't miss the yellow spots in my yard. 6/2/2012-update--I stopped giving this product to my dog. She developed loss of control of her back legs. Occasionally unable to climb steps. Since this is the only drug she receives I immediately stopped giving it to her. She is now more peppier and no problem with rear leg coordination.
1,Grasssaver tabs for dogs,Do not use these tablets. The first ingredient d-methioine is harmful to dogs. It can affect the liver. I just checked with the vet and it is a big no-no.
4,I`ve been looking for some of these tunes for a long time,"Do you remember ""Is this the way to Amarillo"" and ""Dont go down to Reno"" ? Two hits in Scandinavia from the early seventy`s."
4,Great to test and show off your theater room,"I bought this disc for ONE reason...to show off the bass in my theater room. It does this in great fashion.If you like percussion, you deserve this disc."
2,good but never worth 35$,"I expected a study and efficient tool hot enough to slice a foam very easily. but it worked barely. in any respects, cheap material, simple structure(metal rod, plastic holder, adapter and a foot wire) that is it. how come they think they can charge 35$ for this. well maybe I can't find similar product to this. And that's the only reason they can rip us off."
2,creates a LOT of smoke,I normally use a razor in a jigsaw to cut foam for my scenic needs. I bought both this saw and a hotwire bow. While this does cut quickly it creates way more smoke (and smell) than I want to work with.
1,An attempt to cash in,"I have read many books about the life and the death of Marilyn Monroe, so when this ""revealing"" new book came out, I wanted to see what it had to say. What I found was trashy, questionable material. I was wary right away, after reading the Acknowledgements section, where the author gives a large amount of thanks and credit to two people who appear as sources in many Marilyn bios, both of whom have been completely discredited by other (more believable) biographers. They barely even knew the woman, and have spent the years since her death trying to cash in on her memory. The fact that the author relied on these people told me that the material in the book was going to be questionable at best. After reading the entire book, I was left feeling very sad that Marilyn has been exploited yet again. If you want to read a real biography of Marilyn Monroe, I recommend ""Marilyn Monroe: The Biography"" by Donald Spoto."
1,Bolt Stripped,The attachment bolt stripped at about 35 in/lb of torque as measured with a new 1/4 in torque wrench purchased specially for this project. Very soft steel. According to instruction you are suposed to torque this bolt to 100 in pounds. Should have bought from Springfield directly instead of third party.
1,2013 version has changed,"The older version of this used to have a machined grove and an o-ring as it's seal. Now it uses a stepped washer that seats against the end of the male piece. If you really tighten the female end it deforms the stepped washer. The tried & true o-ring was so much better than this new design. Not worth sending back, they will sit in a bin in the garage. ""Yardworks"" brand still uses the o-ring."
3,Good Dead But Not 'Grate' Dead,"I am thrilled about the releases from the Dead vault, both audio and video. I totally agree with another reviewer, drop the special effects!! The disc starts great. The color is crisp and clear, Jerry is bouncy during the first set, all is good. With darkness in the second set, the special effects kick in. Granted, the dead were never much to look at, but they were more exciting to watch than the horrid special effects. Some tunes really rock here, especially Estimated. Wow. The additional footage from Kentucky is somewhat of a downer, including the awful 'Standing On The Moon' that Jerry groans through. The disc would have been better without it. Best to start with the excellent 'Downhill From Here' dvd and move on to this one."
4,solid...,"recorded in possibly hip hop's finest year so far (1994), this album was put on ice for a decade.""moon in cancer"" and the title track both use beats that were also used on intro skits on showbiz and AG's first album, and the rest are in a similar style: minimal but extremely raw. The 3 mc's (one of which is mos def before he got more well known, the other two his brother asnd sister) are up-front on the mic, and not afraid to rap as loud as they can most of the time. The best track here for me is ""You Can Run"", with the most head-nodding beat on the album, and a nice breakdown where they sing the hook to sly stone's ""Runnin"" before the last verse. On this CD you also get a remix of My Kung Fu (also a great track) and what I believe is a J-Swift remix (uncredited in the inlay but Im pretty sure it's him) of the title track with some really slick drums on it. All in all good value and recommended for any hip hop fan."
3,The Juicing Bible,"I thought it would have more recipesin it than it does. Every fact, I think, of every herb for every reason is in this book."
4,Nicely divided chapters,"I really like how the chapters of this book are presented. Based on what your health concern is (i.e.: migraines, pregnancy, etc) you can find recipes that are specifically targeted to that. The only recommendation that I have is for the author to better describe how to prepare some of the juices, for example, must I peel a certain fruit, or root or can I just stick the whole thing in the juicer. Some fruits are obvious, but some, not as much. But overall a great book!"
3,"Fun, but some flaws","I just finished reading this book to my daughter and I have to say she really enjoyed the story. She laughed a lot and asked a lot of questions (which the book answered right away -- really nice).My own hesitation is that Junie's grammar is so awful! My daughter is 3 and doesn't talk like that and never has. English is tough enough even when you hear it spoken properly all the time--I can't imagine it's a good idea to start exposing kids to such blatantly bad grammar. I found myself editing half of what Junie said or thought before speaking it aloud, and was glad my daughter isn't reading these books to herself."
2,This review is for the kindle version of the book,"I have a hard copy of the 3rd edition of this book which was published back in 2008. I strongly believe that this book deserves 5 stars. IMO, this book is essential to all cat owners. However, the book itself is relatively big and heavy so having a kindle version is definitely a good option for some cat owners.Unfortunately, the kindle version of this book is based on the book that was published in 1995. It contains less information and some of them may appear out-of-date. Some of its lighter texts are difficult to read on the Kindle. So I will only rate the kindle version with 2 stars.** Publisher: if you are reading this, could you please update the digital version of this book? Thank you in advance."
2,Ratty book review,"This book arrived without its jacket and came with complimentary coffee stain and everything, The book itself is fine to read but doesn't display well. However like the other 3 books I ordered that day the ad said shipping was $3.99 and I was charged $12.49. Too expensive won't be using this service again."
5,Great for beginner skaters,I purchased these skates for my grandson age 7. He really loves them..They are excellent sidewalk skates and reasonably priced as well.
3,concerned about the odor from wheels,I bought these skates for my grandchildren who both have heart problems. The environment is very important to children who have health issues and also important to all children who are growing. The odor from the wheels are an issue. The skates are made very well. The company is A PLUS. Summit worked with me and returned my shipping cost and also gave me a gift certificate to buy the children something else. I would buy from Summit again but I can not indorse anything that may have plastic odors coming from them that could harm our children. One grandchild was born with a heart issue which could have been caused by the environment and the other ended up with Kawasaki from the chemicals in cleaners while traveling.
2,Amazon needs to update their descriptions.,"This is a great product, but Amazon has them listed as also including 8 silver helms. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN THEM!!!! So I was very disappointed when it came with a chariot instead of the silver helms."
3,The set I got was different...,"As indicated by another reviewer, there is a good chance that you will get the current box which includes one bolt thrower, one chariot, twenty archers and twenty spears/seaguard. I was disappointed when I got this set and it did not include the silverhelms as shown on this page. Other than the misrepresentation it is a great buy if you can get it at a good price."
1,Lousy. Buy something else.,"I have to vent after struggling with this ""simple"" oscillating sprinkler for 15 minutes. I can't get it to spray a reasonable pattern. In theory, you just turn the knob so the setting you want lines up with an arrow. But the resulting spray pattern has zero correlation to what I select. I put it on FULL and it sprays full right and barely oscillates. I put it on CENTER and it does about a 60 degree arc, way off center. I can't find any position that gives me even, side to side, full range oscillation. I don't have time in my life to test each of the ""36 settings"" to find one that works like it's supposed to.Oh, and the thing makes so much noise (I didn't know sprinklers could do that!), the internal gears can't possibly last for long.(Not purchased from Amazon or an affiliate.)"
3,Great Musical,"This videotape of the landmark Stephen Schwartz musical is a must-have for every musical theatre enthusiast. Ben Vereen re-creates his stunning Broadway performance, surrounded by an outstanding all-star cast. But this review is about the video, not the performances. The video was mercilessly whacked apart by David Sheenan, on some kind of a power trip,in many cases undermining the total effect of the program. Definitely buy it, still remember it's not the total product."
3,"Great Show, bad video","It's a shame. Pippin is a great show, but any audio/visual representation of it is below par. The CD has major flaws, and this video has even more. Teh problem does not lie with the cast, which is great, or Fosse's direction/choreography, which is superb. Teh video itself leads much to be desired. In the song ""Glory,"" it is impossible to figure out what is goin one. Many of hte osngs were either trimmed or cut comptetly, and the quality of tahe filming itself was adequate at best. This movie is worth seeing if you've never seen the show and are interested to see what it was all about, or for Fosse's work. And, as I said before, the music, book, etc. is great. Otherwise, this movie is a dud."
1,Stopped working after 3 days,"It worked great for 3 days! Then I noticed the light just stopped working, then it stopped working altogether- it will not even go on. The base is a piece of junk. The copper contacts on the bottom are very flimsy. I will not buy DeLonghi ever again !"
2,Ratings going down,I already said so but the # of pages as well as the ratings are going downdowndown. How could Eglantine be so stupid? And how could she be friends with Ginger? Stupid. And its the shortest book in the series. In every book weird new owl words are made up and the plot in this one jumps/flies all over the place. I wouldnt recommend it but the only way to know its that bad is to read it.
3,classic early post-cyberpunk,"I found Halo to be an excellent extrapolation of the way an AI could kinda evolve out of a complex set of computer systems, and thought it dealt really well the kind of growing pains that this might entail.It also pre-saged a notion I'd encountered before - that when an AI did come forth, people might worship it as they might a god.. and that the best way to detect it might be to look for such cult-like behaviour.The playful nature of AI, Aleph also reminds me of the Rabbit character in Rainbow's End.This, and the fact that was by'n'large non-distopian in subject makes me file it under post-cyberpunk. But it does share the same love affair with pseudo-Zen philosophy that inhabits Neuromancer and Metrophage."
5,Solving an Unpleasant Task,"For this small person, coiling outdoor electric cords in order to store them has always been an unpleasant task. This reel not only solved the coiling process, but hangs neatly on a nail in the storeroom, ready for next use."
1,Doesn't worth the money,"Mine stop working after couple months.If you want to be cheap get a non-electronic one (ball in liquid); if you really want an electronic one get a GPS, they are cheap now."
3,FAIRLY BASIC COVERAGE,"This book, part of the Chambers Encyclopedic reference series, looks at catastrophes of all kinds and arranges them by category in alphabetical order from air disasters to windstorms. Wars and terrorist acts are generally excluded. Each entry provides basic coverage of a calamity, and a small box after each account tells the reader about an interesting fact or aspect related to the event. This book is fine for the general reader with an interest in this area, but it must be noted that not all of the information is accurate, so one must be careful not to rely too heavily on what is written here."
4,excellent work,"A highly enjoyable selection of essays on baseball. Of course, their conclusions are not always right, but they are always entertaining. It's like Bill James crossed with the author of Freakonomics. The essay comparing Bonds to Ruth was perhaps the best of the group. Get this now if you're a real baseball fan."
5,Great book,"great read. It shines some light into generally accepted baseball numbers. If you loved Moneyball, you'll love this book."
3,Nasal passage to India,"To make it vague, Factory 81 is like a well-Tooled Korn machine. How's that? And while the basic elements of this band may not bring anything original to the table, some of the intricacies of their music are astoundingly fresh. I would dare say they are usually better than the bands they borrow from, for what that's worth. The inventive rhythms and layering hold your attention from song to song. And the tight musicianship is very impressive. Most notable is Andrew Cyrulnik's amazing, and sometimes even humorous drumming. He is more than a timekeeper. His drums are an emotive element as sure as the tune. Singer Nathan Wallace's lyrics range from pseudo-spiritual Live prose, to crass ranting.Separation between sounds, and the mature playing are great. The lyrics are crybaby stuff. Maybe when Nathan has a little more real trauma under his belt, we'll see some sparks. He has promise and ideas. The fancy vocalizations should wait until you get down basic crooning."
2,Factory 81 rocks! oh wait ... no ... sorry,"This was originally a good review. Then I edited it. Now it is a bad review. Because I was stupid when I wrote the original. It's okay ... but not worth paying for.The original review said something about this having all great songs ... that wass a lie, they are okay for a while and then grate on your ears after hearing them more than 5 times. It also said to listen to korn ... eew."
4,very entertaining,If you watch this movie you understand why Soviets lost the war in Afghanistan and also will have more respect for ancient culture of that land which in some ways alot more civilized than any western culture.
1,"Not a good movie, in my opinion","Speaking as a former tanker in the real world (US Army), I thought this flick stank. I'm a war movie aficionado and at one time thought that any movie with a tank in it at least rated ""good,"" but this is an exception. 1. The Russian crew talking like a bunch of hippies in a LA commune during the 60s was a turn-off. 2. The Afghan insurgents are portrayed as some of the most inept would-be fighters ever spawned. It's a gross understatement of the fighting prowess of what is, in fact, a clever and effective warrior race. For all their tracking and attacking of a very vulnerable lone tank, the only ones who actually kill any Russians are either other Russians or Afghan women! Afghan fighters are better than that. It's really pathetic and not very realistic. The only reason I give it one star is that the system won't let me give it a zero. Save your money."
4,Interesting perspective from another countries experience in Afghanistan,This movie was made quite a while ago but has some relevance for what our country is going through right now. It's interesting from a war movie buff's perspective simply because neither side in this particular conflict was American.
3,War trumps idiology,"War becomes the ""BEAST"" of the title, though the TANK is the vehicle that carries the action.I am, however, looking for a Russian, or maybe Soviet, movie that, I think, if it exists, was the origional, much grittier, version of this film.If you know of that film, which I think is called ""TANK"" (in English), please let me know where I can get a copy.markbohrod@aol.com"
5,Nice Product for old phone,"Solid, not flimsy, good connectors, travels well. Just what I needed to get a bit more life from my old phone."
5,Nostalgia!,"This double CD is filled with absolutely gorgeous love songs from a by-gone era. Although I wasn't yet born during World War II, I know a lot of the songs from my parents playing them, and they don't go out of style. Engelbert does a superb job of singing them, as he does with everything. I highly recommend this CD set - it's the best collection of these old love songs I've heard!"
5,Great product,"This package size used to be available from local drugstores, no longer - they only have the larger size which isn't legal for air travel carry on. This 3 oz size is perfect"
3,"Looks Good, But Not Worth The Money","My 8-year-old daughter received the Disco for Christmas. It looked great in the photos, but looks can be deceiving. The working runway works great if you position the doll just right in the stand-carrier....It is a balancing act! Once the child learns to position the doll correctly, it's no problem. The working lights are a great touch. But having said all that, just how much fun is the toy? My daughter placed the doll on the runway and watched the doll make a couple of rounds, then that was it! The toy has sat since Christmas. Take the money this toy would cost you and buy something with REAL play value. My children have played more with the Bratz dolls than the expensive Bratz accessory sets. As I've said before, if you have the money to spare and your child wants it, by all means..buy it!"
3,You'll need SuperGlue,"The current price..is too much for these poorly molded pieces of plastic. After our daughter patiently waited for us to Super Glue the parts together (because it wouldn't stay together on it's own), she spent an hour or so playing, and lost interest. Spend your hard earned money on something more durable."
4,Very nice but much smaller than anticipated,"Nice set of two soap dish(s) that come complete with caulk. Material is versatile, easy to keep clean and perfect for the DIY type. Only complaint is that these are smaller than I anticipated. At the time of this writing, dimensions were lacking but these are just large enough to put one bar of soap on each shelf...nothing more. Still a good choice but be aware of the limited size."
2,Not if you have high blood pressure!,This is nothing but salt (and I am looking at the box right now): a whooping 490 mg PER SERVING! You can get the same taste by making them out of low sodium tuna fish with the traditional recipe. One has to be very careful of Goya products. The salt content is not per package or can but per serving.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I should have known before I bought it; sci-fi readers will most likely not enjoy basic fiction. You must really like what you are reading about in order for a book to make a lasting impression on you. IMO in the Mist, King uses too much description; and I believe too many adjectives/description looses the reader. Shane Lindsley author of Enemies Among Us"
4,More Solid Writing From King,"When I pick up a Stephen King book, I know what I'm going to get: characters with which I can easily identify, strong psychological undertones, evocative narrative, and a pace to the story that can only be described as breathtaking. The Mist is a shining example of how King uses all these qualities to make an enjoyable story. With the story's claustrophobic setting acting as an amplifier for his writing style's qualities, King has once again made credible a tale that would otherwise be unbelievable. While there are a couple of missteps in his presentation (I know that he was trying to depict the fragility of society's mores; but, I still thought the sex scene was gratuitous), The Mist is both a perfect introduction to King's style for first time readers and a great reminder to long-time fans as to why they enjoy his writing."
2,"Good idea, poor execution. Not scary.","I was very dissapointed with this recording.The dialogue in this cd is very cheesy and takes away from the power of the binaural audio. They did not use the binaural audio enough, it is only spiced in here and there.The kid really ruins it in my opinion. They should have gotten a more mature actor for that part.Also, the story is one continuous 70 minute track which is annoying if you want to stop and come back to the story later on."
4,The 3-D sound makes this unique among audiobooks.,"The Mist is a spine-tinglingly claustrophobic story. It features a full cast of actors and excellent sound effects. The quality of the production is greatly augmented by the the 3-D sound which permeates the entire story. Strangely, The Mist is the only 3-D audiobook I've ever found."
2,The movie was better,"It was written well, and not too long, and that's why I gave it two stars... because in every other respect it was disappointing. Not enough monster face offs, not enough clear monster descriptions, not enough action, no explanation of the Mist phenomenon... I get what King is trying to do, he wants to get our imagination going, and leave all the loose ends hanging so that our minds fill the rest. But then... he didn't show us anything we couldn't have thought of of dreamed of ourselves, did he?In my humble opinion, the movie was better."
1,The worst Coffee maker I ever Purchased,This product is by far the worst coffee maker I have ever purchased or used. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. DeLonghi should be embarrassed to put their name on it!! A total disappointment and waste of money. I would have rated this with Negative Stars if there was an option for it!! A TOTAL LET DOWN!
4,Get to know Spain for children,"This is a very nice book to introduce children to a diferent culture. The book shows how people etertain in Spain in a very child oriented way. This is the true Spain, and it is very well writen for children 4 to 8 years old. The wonderful illustrations make it a perfect book for pre-readers, giving you the opportunity to talk about many things. The spanish is simple and also the story."
1,Skylink ML-100 AAA+ -- Buyer Beware,I just want to warn all potential customers that this product has not been reliable. My unit broke down twice in a period of 8 months. I sent it once for repairs and I had to wait 4 weeks to get it back. Two after I setup the unit the same problem all over again. Here is what happens: you can program all your sensors no problem but somehow the unit can no longer receive or loses it's ability to hear the sensors -- the sensors will not trigger the alarm. The wireless communication fails.Part of my regret is that I purchased many extra sensors that ended up costing me hundreds of dollars. I intend to smash the unit with a hammer and send Skylink the pictures for their inspection!
3,what size is this blanket?,I am interested in buying this blanket but the page doesn't say what the dimensions are....seller: please let us know.
3,really?,"C'mon, it's mustache wax tor crying out loud. The only reason I got it online is because where I live you really can't find much of anything. If it ain't at Wal-Mart, you're screwed...and WallyMart doesn't have this product."
4,"Good, but doesn't do well in extreme heat.","This is a good general moustache wax. I especially appreciated being able to order it in a variety of colors. The small comb that comes with the wax is also very handy. I use the comb even with other moustache waxes that I have bought. The only downside is that it doesn't hold up well in extreme heat. Indoors it works very nicely, but when I stay outside for more than a minute or two in 90 degree plus heat, the wax loses its ability to hold shape. If you are going to be spending much time outdoors in the heat, I'd recommend a harder wax like Firehouse Wacky Tacky. Otherwise, this is good general purpose wax that is inexpensive and comes in a assortment of shades to fit your hair color."
2,Did you just repackage Qwik?,"So I figured I'd try this stuff out after reading some reviews. The neutral wasn't available where I picked it up, so bought the brown. Now, I would say I have brown hair and facial hair. I would also say ""dark brown"" over ""light brown"", but apparently not.First time I put this on I really thought I was rubbing shoe polish on my face. I immediately washed it off. I tried again, and it really darkened my moustache...okay, so I gave it another try. I did like the hold it provided, but between the color - I know it can't be perfect, but comment on the neutral was that it stuck out on dark hair - and the scent...man, that doesn't seem like a manly scent to me, but more of...well...shoe polish.2 Starts because the hold wasn't bad."
4,Solid Product,"I recommend the Clubman Moustache Wax. It holds well and doesn't feel clumpy or too thick. To maintain a good moustache curl you will need to reapply the product at least once throughout the day. The wax could be a bit stromger, but then again if it was too thick then it would feel like you put gell or hair spray in it and as we all spend a fair amount of time talking and eating you do want your mustache to have a little flexibility --- so as I mentioned above, I do recommend this product."
5,Must have!,My kitty's love these flip flops! My female carries it all over the house and hides it from the others. It has a strong catnip scent which is hard to find in most toys.
3,Swiss Tech BodyGard 5-in-1 Multi-Function Emergency Tool with Key Ring,I bought 4 of these and one does not work. I tried replacing the battery but that didn't help. How can I return or replace this article?
2,great function - lousy reliability,"If Delonghi has two engineers designing their fryers, the one who designes the functions deserves five stars while the other who engineers the product gets no stars. From reading other reviews, the problem always seems to be where the power comes in. Our case also. The plastic module to which wires attach burnt not only itself but also made a good black hole into the table. A letter to Delonghi failed to provide us with a new part, but we like the fryer functions enough to have bought a new one. This one is on a marble base. But please note that Delonghi does not send a marble block with this unit ..."
5,Wonderful,"As a beginner Banjo player, it was wonderful to hear the pros! I have always dreamed of playing the banjo, and now am able to take lessons. I loved to be able to preveiw your tapes. Thanks Agin, Marian hunt"
5,Three hard-to-find tracks,"There are exactly three reasons to own this album:1. Tattoo of the Sun, previously only available with one of their singles. An excellent song that should have been on an album years ago.2. Slow Motion, with the lyrics, which anyone in the US missed out on. This alone is worth the price. Along with Motorcycle Drive By (also on this album), Slow Motion is Third Eye Blind at their best.3. My Time in Exile, which is said to be on the DVD release of Out of Vein. Also an excellent track.Even if you own every other Third Eye Blind album, it's worth it to pick up this one for these songs alone."
1,"Pop-Ups, No Text","The reviews here are for the regular book, not the pop-up book...I was wrongly assuming this would be a version w/text and some pop-ups. This is literally only 6 pages which is fine if you know that's what you're getting."
3,Harry Potter Mom,"My 3 year old ""loves"" all things Harry Potter, especially since big brother does. Have been looking foward to something that was more on his level for him to enjoy. The book is very nice. He enjoys the pop up and action tabs. The artwork is nice. I was very disappointed that it has no words at all! A little story would have been nice. He does, however, enjoy the book and is very proud to have is ""own"" Harry Potter book."
1,unrecieved,i would like to give this book a great review i purchased it on oct 19 2011 and am yet to recieve it.thanks apollo.
4,Round out your understanding of the American Revolution,"""Tories"" and ""loyalists"" have always been in the background of our independence story but largely nameless, faceless and forgotten. Flesh them out and ""The Revolution"" is a layered conflict where ""Civil War"" is difficult to square with the mythology it has become. Not all Americans were enamored with the break and many took up arms against their neighbors to prevent it. Why they did it, where they came from, how their story unfolded and the diaspora that followed are all facinating aspects of a journey most Americans simply know nothing about. This is well written, both statistical without being dry and anecdotal without a loss of perspective. This should be required reading for anyone with more than a passing interest of the Revolutionary era."
3,Good introduction to the GRE,This book is a good buy over all. It has a good vocabulary list with good descriptions of what the words mean. The math section is week at times and should only be used by those who have not done math for a long time and want to brush up on their skills. A beter book for the math section is Barrons. The sample questions in this book are also very week and the test is a lot harder especially the quantitative part.
5,Great tool for improving your score,"I had already bought other books from The Princeton Review, so it was no suprise to find that this one is also very objective and intelligent."
3,Elementary text covers introduction to horticulture,"Plant biology for the beginning horticulture student. A broad survey of topics a horticulture student should know something about, including genetics, plant anatomy and biology, botanical terminology, basic techniques of propagation and culture, etc. If you have studied botany, plant physiology and general biology, you don't need this book. I work in landscaping and found the book short on practical information that is specific to horticulture."
1,HORRIBLE LITTLE TOASTER!,"I bought this toaster because I liked the features, and thought it was manufactured in Italy and not China. Either way, it is a terrible toaster and I would have expected better from a 15.00 toaster. It doesn't toast evenly, and it doesn't appear the elements are working that well either. I spent a lot of money to buy this and expected better."
4,Flying high,"I'm enjoying this instructional blues harp video, taught by Madcat Ruth, for it gives me an idea of what it must've been like in Woodstock, NY, during the days of heavily laden air...Kidding aside, with a bunch of dedicated practice I can be a better harpist having had the experience of learning from this DVD.Perhaps a bit too expensive, but ""what the hey"".Zippity Doo-Dah"
4,RB 4075 Sunglasses,"Great pair of glasses. They don't fit my face perfectly, but that could be due to the shape of my face..."
4,Great glasses,"Sturdy and really comfortable. The polarized optics make a big difference in reducing reflections and overall light in your eyes. Also, the shape works well with my rounded face."
4,A must for any TRUE DanFan,"This CD has several GREAT songs that you can't hear anywhere else. Mock turtle soup, Horse in town, and Brain tap are just a few of the highlights that I cant believe The Dan never reworked and polished. Quality is subpar, but this is a nice piece of Steely history that is a must for any TRUE DanFan."
1,Pakistan: Between Mosque And Military,Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time.
2,Single or EP?,"I believe that there is a mistake with this listing. I think that this is the Relative Ways EP NOT the Relative Ways Single. I'm going by the release dates. The EP was released on November 6, 2001, and the Single was released some time in 2002 according to my research.Just sayin'. I mistakenly bought it because I thought it was the single and didn't check close enough until after I'd payed."
3,"so-so, but looks good","I had a hard time finding a toaster that could accomodate my long slices (do manufacturers really expect everyone to only eat wonderbread-sized slices?) and that would look cool on my countertop. This one does both, BUT it toasts unevenly - one side gets more than the other, and the lift is a joke. I still burn my fingers when I try to fish out small pieces. The problem is there are not many other toasters out there that can fulfill my criteria. If you know of any, let me know, I'd gladly trade up from this one. Until then I'll stick with this one. The chrome finish after a couple of years is a bit off for some reason."
1,worse toaster I ever owned,"Toasting is uneven across each side and from one side to the other. Toasting is also inconsistent from one use to another. Can't depend on the settings giving consistent results. Worse design aspect is that you need to use two hands to remove your toast most of the time, per the design the toast does not fully elevate when done. You need to hold the lever up while you remove the toast. I hate this product and wish I could return it for a full refund. But yes, it looks good. Lesson learned, never buy a product that does not offer a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee."
4,The Search for Major Plagge,Very interesting book and excellent bibliography. I learned some more about the despicable acts of the German SS during WWII.I read it while traveling on a river ship through Germany. A good read!
5,Total steal at the posted price of $6.99,"Its a totally addictive - albeit M rated game. Its fun as hell, grpahics are realistic and many of the ladders etc. are still fun to play even after 5 years of the game's release!Strongly recommended. The advanced hardware of today makes this game a total pleasure to play especially with the graphics settings set to the highest possible setting! I have a Core-2 Duo with 2GB RAM and at the peak audio / video settings, the CPU usage is approx. 50% and stays level. UT3 (released in Nov 2007) hogs my machine though it is a sexier version of the same game!Looking forward to getting online with the UT2004 version and having some serious matches. Hope to see you there."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I used to work at Electolux Home Products and the insiders tell me there is no reliable portable vac on the market. I didn't listen.I bought at clearance centre and figured it was Delonghi and not Black & Decker, so I got it. For about a year, I thought differently, but then the battery died. What Customer Service I got , they said that you must drain battery and perform a full charge. Perhaps. When I did get a local accessory supplier, they informed that a replacement battery costs more than a new vac, it wasn't worth it.Morale, Delonghi or no-name, portable vacs are disappointing."
4,"Excellent, if uneven",Strongest parts of the book are how the fracturing of the New Deal Coalition came about and the collapse of the Carter presidency. Hayward is at his best when he's dispassionate and lets the events speak for themselves.Weak points are the lack of extensive narrative on the Prop 13 tax revolt (the first true sign of the coming conservative wave) and the glossing over of how Watergate deeply damaged the liberal wing of the Republican Party (setting the stage for the ascendency of Reagan).This is a very well written book. Lively. Doesn't bog down in trivial details. Always keeps events in perspective of the sweeping change that was taking place in America.Well worth adding to your collection.
2,"Probably great, but not for an electric shaver","I may have misunderstood the purpose of this product, but from the details and reviews I read on Amazon, I got the impression that this will help me get a closer, smoother shave with my electric shaver. Well, it doesn't. I'm sure it works great with razors.For shaving with my machine, I went back to use talcum powder. Yeah, gross, but works great. Just remember to rinse your face well after shaving and apply a good moisturizer."
2,IT is not worth it !,I bought this book and I am bitterly disappointed! The reading passages are awefull and the math section is too easy to be true ! It is justt not worth it !
1,Dishonest company robbed me of 77 bucks,I bought this item for $209 and promptly returned it and was credited back only $132. I never opened the box and have been robbed. They still owe me $77DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! They can not do simple math.
1,Hated this.,"Even though this looks like your kids can play with this set, they will have a hard time. There are a bizillion pieces (even the hair comes off the figures) that don't stay together. The back drop is way too flimsy to do anything but stay in one location without being touched. If I wanted something this delicate, I wouldn't have bought a plastic nativity set."
4,A really cute set to add to any playmobil collection,"Despite your religious beliefs, this is a really cute set. The figures are very colorful and adaptable with other plymobil sets. I was thrilled to find a Nativity set that my boys could actually play with. They acutally end up with this set mixed in with their other sets. The kings they use with their castle sets. They love the colorful robes and the crowns.I am a bit disappointed with the thin card stock backdrop. At least it could have been mounted on a piece of plastic. Unlike other Playmobil sets, this backdrop just will not hold up to excessive play. Hence the 4 stars.All in all, this worked out to be a fabulous year round addition to the boy's collection, in fact, every Christmas we have to reassemble this set to use as originally intended.Your children will love this set. As with any Playmobil set, the mix and match, item swap potential encourages wonderful imaginative play.YOu can never go wrong with Playmobil.Rosemary Bertinelli"
2,1200mah Eurus Li-ion Li-10b,"I was under the impression that these Batts. were replacements for my original batteries, they did work with the charge that was in them however they will not recharge with the camera's charger. I now have to find another compatable battery."
2,NOT the best toaster ever,"while there are great features on this machine,after about a month, toast ceased to come outevenly browned..... very disappointing forprice."
5,What a deal!,"Until we got this backpack my son's Leapster L-Max games were here and there.... but now he proudly keeps them together in his cool new backpack. No more searching for SpongeBob!! This backpack is just the right size for a youngster's little body and makes them feel like a big kid having this to carry stuff in. The velcro-adjustable shoulder strap was also a nice idea! This will fit him for years and years to come. This backpack is made of good quality material and nice sturdy zippers. The compartments are roomy enough for chubby little hands to be able to dig around in to find the game they're looking for. This backpack was a great buy for me and will help IMMENSELY with trips to the doctor, etc. Way to go Leapster! This Mom gives you a BIG A+! If you buy a Leapster... go ahead and get the backpack at the same time! Why wait? You'll need it!"
2,Sorry people but I hate Soren,"I didn't like this book at all. The journey to the Northern Kingdoms was really random. Also, I hate how Soren is the leader of everything. It drives me crazy."
4,The Burning,"Soren and his band of owls have gone to the Northern Kingdoms with several different tasks to prepare for the upcoming war with the Pure Ones. They are charged with doing research, recruiting help from the Northern Forces, and training with new ice weapons. This is a highly dangerous mission and there is a chance they could be killed. Each maturing owl will be tested mentally and physically preparing for and fighting in the war against the Pure Ones.The Burning had the most action of any of the books in the series so far. It also had great descriptions of the Northern Kingdoms, and an incredible encounter with a polar bear! I enjoyed how each owl matures and how their individual personalities start to come through a bit more. I will be interested to see how they will change further and if their relationships with each other will change in the upcoming books of the series."
3,disappointed,"I am a great fan of Ms. Quinn, and I loved all of Bridgerton series so far. That is why I couldn't wait to read this book. But, what a disappointment!! There was no strong development in detail how and why Colin fall in love with Penelope. Colin's character (which seemed to be witty, care free in previous series), was not described and developed well (all it mentioned was how he was hungry for food all the time, also literally written he was 'witty' and had a great smile). Only pleasurable plot of the story was when Colin announced Penelope's secret to everyone. Oh, well.. I guess I'll have to wait for Elois's story."
4,A Real Romance,"I really liked this book, with all of Quinn's humorous writing style, witty dialogue and sparkling characters. The fact that both characters are judged by outward appearances and only when they begin to look inside the person do they begin to fall in love, makes for a really likeable romance. The Lady Whistledown plot does get wearisome, but that's only minor details. Don't let it ursurp the fact that the romance is realistic, beautiful and will endear you to both characters."
2,Not great.,"When I read An Offer From a Gentleman I thought for sure that I had found my new favorite romance author, but this book really didn't do anything for me.I like the 'Sabrina' like story, but I think Colin's attraction to Penelope wasn't developed believeably. He fell in love with her too fast and for no reason.And Lady Danbury was just obnoxious. I had to roll my eyes every time she said how clever and wonderful Penelope was (which was about 45 times), because Penelope never really said anything clever.I liked the Lady Whistledown mystery to a point, but overall I thought this book was pretty weak."
1,Disjointed and unromantic,"Colin knows Penelope most of his adult life. His sister's ever-present best friend and yet he's just now figuring out she's more than that.Penelope is the wallflower with a secret love and secret hobby. But she never really shows us she deserves the romance she gets.It seems like a lot of time wasted on indulging the Bridgerton clan wars, with interjection of unlikely romance, no real passion and arbitrary plot twists. Midway through the book, I felt like Quinn decided to write a different story, albeit one more exciting but with the same dud characters from the first half of the book."
3,Boring!,"After reading ""The Duke and I"", I couldn't wait until I got to read Colin's story, because I loved his personality and thought he was the one ""Bridgerton"" brother, that most interested me. However, this story was just plain boring. There really wasn't much romance in the book - instead the whole thing was pretty much on the revealing of ""Lady Wistledown"".(Which I had been curious about anyway) I loved Colin, and was so looking forward to a good romantic story with him. This was still a cute book, but the previous 3 were by far way better."
2,Very Disappointed!!!!,"I Loved the first three novels of the Bridgerton series, but this way very disappointing! The romance was flat the coversation was not funny nor interesting between the characters and the story line at times was repetitive. The only good thing in this book was finding out who Lady Whisledown is. I hope that book five in the series is better!"
2,Please Pass the Real Romance Novel!,"The other Bridgerton books were awesome. Julia Quinn is my favorite romance author and head & shoulders above the usual garbage out there. I was SO disappointed by this book. Sorry, but listening to Colin whine about the fact that it's not fair that he doesn't have a purpose in life is just stupid. Wah, wah. He comes off as a big whiny bug. The discovery of who is Lady Whistledown is anti-climactic and then to listen to Colin whinge about the fact that Lady Whistledown is a published author and he isn't is, once again, just tiresome. The romance side of things is pretty bland. I guess if you want to read the entire series, you have to get through this one, but don't read this one first! I can highly recommend the rest of the books, however!"
5,"Ten Kids, No Pets is such a great book!","Ten Kids, No Pets is funny, and VERY good!I didn't want the book to be over when I was finished, thats how good I thought it was!For people who haven't read it yet, get it out and put your nose in that book because you will enjoy it!"
2,nice but defective,"It's a nicely made product that did exactly what I wanted it to. Unfortunately I apparently got a defective one, because it conked out after a few days of intermittent use. At the price, I might try another one on the assumption that I was just unlucky the last time."
1,don't last long,use it for a week and stop working bought anotherone and didn't even last a whole week
1,no need,"This is a cute item, but unremarkable otherwise. We looked & then bought a similar pack for 5 bucks at Marshalls."
2,Quite a disappointment,"My husband and I loved the short-lived BBC series ""Beautiful People,"" so it was with much excitement that I bought this book, upon which the series was based. Luckily for the TV show, it had a brilliant writer in Jonathan Harvey, who somehow managed to take a rather pedestrian and not particularly funny book and transform it into a hilarious, yet very human and touching, series.As for this book, well, I got one mild chuckle while reading it. Seriously. One. Single. Chuckle. The writing style is mundane, the constant use of French is annoying, the numerous photographs are often given no context, and there is almost no narrative flow. These tales of Doonan's youth are presented in a very slapdash, seemingly random order. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling, but here it just feels lazy and scattershot. It's like a long conversation about constantly changing topics that all of a sudden just . . . ends."
4,Love it!,It's hard to find a size 14 ring and I am so glad that I found this one! It's a heavy weight and my boyfriend wears it all the time. My only wish is that the pattern went all the way around. It's hard to see but the knot work is in 3 separate parts to make the complete ring.
5,basic more challenging than advanced!,"I got these tapes for my sister for christmas, but it seems that i've actually used them more than her!The set has the instructional, which i have never cared to watch.The basic, which is a 30min workout, it seems to be more challenging than the advanced. The advanced has 20mins of cardio, then 20mins of abs and buns on the floor and then about 8 or so minutes of kicks of all sorts, then a cool down, but the basic just keeps going and going after 20mins and your heart rate has gone up with a great 10mins of lower body with back kicks, and front kicks and side kicks and all that.The 8min workout, its really like 15mins of an advanced workout.One bad thing, Billy just can't keep count of the repetitions in these Live tapes, it is annoying! despite that, workouts are great."
2,too much advertising you can't skip,I was very dissapointed with the Taebo Live DVD. You cannot skip the advertising that begins each of the sections and so you have to listen to it EVERY time. I also think the routines are a bit choppy. the original TaeBo Workout and Get Ripped are much better.If you are a current TaeBo enthusiast I recommend you skip this DVD
3,Worked Good for Awhile,"We had the charger for 6 months before it broke. The charger was plugged into our phone on the counter, when my daughter accidentaly caught the wire and the phone fell to a thickly padded rug. One of the prongs broke off, luckily not in the phone, but it was useless none the less. We got quite a bit of use out of the charger before it broke so it's not necessarily a poorly made product. I would blame it more on the fact the phone and, hence, accessories, are small and therefore break more easily and that accidents do happen. We were happy with it before and will buy another one."
3,"Great, but I have one warning:","My son loves this toy. Lots to do. He enjoyed it more when he was younger, but he still loves it. And he just turned two. He now primarily uses it for the piano, which he really enjoys.However, the legs pop off VERY easily. He has little friends who come over for playdates, and it's almost always inevitable that at some point in the playdate, somebody is going to get hurt. One of the kids always leans on it, or tries to sit on it, and the legs pop off. And the kid falls down with it, and cries. Drama rama! It happens almost every time. So we finally took the legs off, and just keep the top part down on the floor. The kids love it. It's a great little toy, but it's a shame that we cannot keep the legs on safely enough. I would prefer it raised off of the floor. It would make his room look a lot more tidy, if you ask me."
4,Good Music Table,I bought this for my 16month old daughter. She plays with it a decent amount and its good for the price. I saw a lot of other music tables out there that cost more and I think she would have liked them all the same. The Lego flip side is cool and she likes to shove stuff in the little cuby where the Legos go. I think that might be her favorite part. My favorite part is that all the sound parts come with an off switch!
1,Placebo,"I did not notice any change in strength or energy. However, I did notice a change in my sex drive. It went away completely. It is slowly coming back now that I have stopped taking the product. I unfortunately bought two bottles and have one that I will not ever open."
1,excellent service but no cigar,"The service was excellent, but I received the wrong repair manual. Unfortunately there was no stock of the one ordered."
2,Leaks,"This is a nice looking brush but it leaked after a few months. I purchased it along with the regular steel brush and the small round soap dispensing brush. They look great together in the OXO steel organizer but b/c you stand this handle down, the soap just runs right out of the valve. I recommend the regular brush and small circular one but not this."
5,Super Scrubber,"This thing kicks butt. I formerly had the OXO scrubber that looks similar, only with a sponge/scrubber on the end instead of the nylon bristles. This cleans much better, getting baked on gunk off dishes without scratching anything, and the head is much more durable so you don't have to change it as often. In fact, I haven't changed it once and it's still good as new while the old sponge brush would degrade after just a few weeks. I feel like the bristles are more sanitary than the sponge too - they get pretty clean when I rinse the brush off."
3,An Oko Failure,"If I need a kitchen tool I always look to see if Oxo makes what I need. This is the first time I am disappointed.The filler is constantly getting popped open and after three months of use it is now leaking where the brush attaches to the head. We now pretty much use it like an old fashioned scrub brush, squirting soap on it as needed (with our Oxo soap dispenser that I love). Hopefully the second version will fix these issues."
2,Nice brush - fatal flaws,"I purchased this back in December 2010. On the face this is a great brush. The problem is that after just over 10 months of use, there is a hole in the black 'squirt' bubble that now allows the soap to leak out.The soap capacity is a bit lacking for the size of the body.I have a number of OXO products and have found them to be generally of good quality for a reasonable price. I would steer clear of this one. Please consider that the reviews probably were done early in the 'honeymoon' period."
2,Soap leaks out all over,"I am not at all happy with this dish brush. The soap does not some out easily, it leaks soap all over the place. The soap reservoir opens up each time I use it to clean a glass. I'll go back to the way less expensive dish brush with a sponge head and a screw off top to fill it with soap. Costs about $3.00 at Walmart."
4,Great brush!,"Great for what you need it for... Gets stuff off the plate... The squirting feature is nice, but their is a drawback. Even with some soap in there, it doesnt squirt. The key to making it squirt is that you have to add a bit of water in the container so it keeps pressure in there. So yea, once you do that your good to go."
1,Changed my mind,"I wrote a one star review which I am trying to correct to a FOUR. When I wrote the first review, I just wanted to know about straight beading. I was too much of a beginner to realize that I would quickly get interested in several of the other types of beadwork she describes. This is in fact a good overall intro, although if you really do serious work in an area, you'll still need another book dedicated to that topic. However, the materials in the ""kit"" were cheap and not as described. The needle was too big for half the beads, and she doesn't include the basic materials you would need to make any one of the projects. That's why it gets a FOUR, not a 5."
1,Horrible garbage bags,"These trash liners are the worst trash liners I've ever purchased. I can't believe I have a thousand of them! They rip if you stare at them too long. The photo shows a liner filled with what I can only assume is shredded tissue paper, and I guess that's about the only use for this liner. It can't be used for actual trash unless you have a different liner to put this one in when it tears like rice paper."
4,GREAT VALUE!,I couldn't believe it - an affordable steam cleaner. All others on the market were way way overvalued for the functions. In most cases one doesn't need the full size version as normally only have a spill here or a blemish there. This tool is great and even comes with accessories - so GO FOR IT is my advice. What do have to lose if you not satisfied return it as you only use water!
2,Disappointing,"I got this toaster 1 1/2yrs. ago. It worked fine for a while, but the dial started to give me trouble. It finally just quit working - the dial would rotate but the bell stopped working and it wouldn't turn on at all. Linen's n Things wouldn't take it back and De Longhi was not helpful.It looks cool, but not worth the money."
1,Manufacturing Defect,"I received the DeLonghi XR640 Toaster Oven and was disappointed to find it unuseable. The wire rack inside was such a tight fit, it took 2 hands to pull it out! After a few times doing this, the enamel finish was starting to come off, which would soon result in rusting metal. I never turned it on, just returned it immediately."
1,Not well made. No Manual off switch and Plastic timer breaks,We bought this because it looked cool and well made at first look. After getting it home and working we started to notice that there is now way to turn off the timer once started. The only way to turn the heat off is to spin the dial to off and wait for the timer to stop...turns out to be very annoying. The timer/on/off dial is now broken after 5 months...we noticed after we realized the toaster was still on 30 mins after the Timer had finished. The oven controls are made very cheaply...even used cheap plastic. DO NOT BUY...very disappointed all around for a toaster priced at 120...fair market value $39.00 (Buyer beware)
1,DeLongi never again!,"Yah, it looks cool but this is the worst product that I have ever purchased from a major manufacturer. The door does not seat right, after little over a year the timer died leaving the oven on all the time. I can't see how DeLonghi can sell this product especially at a premium price!"
1,Wax Museum Toaster! It Looks Good BUT NOTHING INSIDE!!!!,"The ""retro"" and the reputation I thought I found ""THE ONE""!!! I don't think I ever had a goldilocks piece of toast aka ""JUST RIGHT""... The timer was inconsistent, and would still work even WITHOUT being plugged in!!!The heating element inside melted , bent and stopped working ... For the amount ( over $ 150.00) I felt BURNT!!!I will not buy this brand again, and will trust reviews...I guess ""Retro"" means will not work after your warranty expires!!! Fahgettaboutit""!!!!"
5,I Love this,"The capacity is perfect for my 4 person family. The timer does click which I like, not too loud. If my toast is done before the timer is done I just leave the dooor open for a few seconds until it is done. With a little more experience it is easy to gauge setting the timer"
3,It's a toaster oven!!,"The toaster oven is great to look at and it works well. What do you expect from a toaster oven? It broils, bakes and toast. Exactly what it's suppose to do at an inflated price"
2,sick of buying toaster ovens,"I've had this one about a 18 months. The toast time is long, and now it has become a fire hazard. Once it's on it won't turn off. The only way to stop it is to unplug it, and the outlet is behind the oven and the oven becomes very hot after use. Into the trash it will go and I will now have to buy the 6th toaster oven in the last 7 years. I will never buy this brand again. Computer technology is more reliable than a simple toaster/oven!"
1,"Faulty Timer, too.","We've had this toaster oven for a little over a year... I bought it because I knew it would look great in my kitchen (and it does). BUT, the ""chrome"" around the front window is peeling, it doesn't broil any longer and after we shut it off after cooking or toasting it turns itself back on - causing an incredibly dangerous fire hazard... We must unplug it after each use...what a pain! Heed the warnings of others and avoid this toaster oven!"
2,Worked well for about 3 months,"Me and my husband had received this as a house wwarming gift and were in love with it...at first. It looked great at first, and took up considerably less space than a microwave. However the timer stopped working after only about 5 or 6 months. So, we would just set another timer, and then turn it off. But the thing up and died all together after about a year and a half. It was also very difficult to clean, even the exterior got to looking very bad. I would never buy this again."
2,DeLONGHI'S TIMING SURE IS OFF!,A sun dial would be more use to us than the timer on this toaster oven. Jiggling helps but then it heats to the highest burning any bread we had hoped to toast.Calls to the manufacturer have been futile.The only thing retro about this item is the way it doesn't work.
2,on/off switch breaks,"My switch broke today too, just about 13 months after I bought it (just enought time for the warranty to expire). My last DeLonghi, despite the cool look."
1,Not even 2 years of use before it died!,All of a sudden no heat....nothing! I'm highly disappointed and plan on call the manuf. tomorrow. I do not recommend this product...my next one will be a simple brand.
1,overpriced junk,It's broken already after 6months of minimal use. My wife was so set on getting this cuz it looked pretty. I was against the idea cuz my B&D toaster oven which i purchased for [a small price] and had since college was still working great albeit not the prettiest. i caved in and now i'm sorry that i did. ...
5,AeroGarden Shelf,"Excellent! I love this shelf, it is in my kitchen and I hung it myself. I found the studs and put it together which was minimal and had it up on my wall in about 30 minutes. Very nice looking shelf."
5,An excellent resource,"Having looked at several picture dictionaries, I rate this one the best. I teach private French lessons and I love the format of this book--words are grouped in categories (grocery store, at home, clothing, etc.) with colorful illustrations. The book also includes a map of the French-speaking world and an alphabetical dictionary in the back."
2,too much sax,"Expecting some things to be similar to the first album, I was a little disappointed upon listening through this album. Almost every track had some kind of saxaphone in it. Sounded more jazzy and not as grooving or funkified as the first. No one song really stood out to me, and in a way it all kind of became a little redundant after awhile...because of too much sax. Hopefully thier next venture will get some of the groove back, with less sax."
3,good,I bit small but good info. and pictures to show how to build root cellars. I would say that others would like to see this one.
4,Game for all,"This is a superb game. This game is a must for anyone who appreciates board games and even for those who don't. This game is loved by absolutely everyone.Even though it's made in the USA (which I find is a huge +), the manufacturing quality of the game is very low. I bought one, and then got a replacement and both of these are low quality. Pieces just won't stay together, ends don't match go in one another properly, etc. I started playing this game over a decade ago, and back then quality was much much better from what I remember.Thank you"
5,Excellent guide!!,"We were considering a trip through Yellowstone and Idaho when our family gave this book to us. We are definitely going to both and can hardly wait!The book is written very well. The author manages to illustrate Idaho's rich history and must-see stops in such a way that it does not read like a typical, dull atlas or encyclopedia. The Ultimate Idaho Atlas and Travel Encyclopedia is enjoyable to read and easy to navigate. We highly recommend this book!"
5,Great Price with Rebate Through 2013,"Great Product at a Great Price. Only $2.27 each with the rebate being offered all this year. With Amazon Prime, shipped to your door in two days. Learning to use quality maintenance parts in vehicle as they and I get older. People who know cars have recommended these to me to increase performance and help deal with any air/fuel mixture problems."
1,Draw your own conclusions,"Bosch Platinum, Platinum 2 and Platinum 4 are differentiated by number of ground electrodes and diameter of center platinum electrode. A Bosch service rep recently told me that Bosch has reduced the diameter of platinum used in the Platinum 4 to maintain profit margins given the increasing cost of commodities.Draw you own conclusions, but some other facts to consider:*1.Bosch Platinum is NOT OE in any make/model and never has been since it's introduction in 1983.*2.Bosch Platinum has not been sold in Germany since the late 1980's due to poor reputation.*3.Bosch Platinum has one of the highest gross margin percentages of any aftermarket plug sold, thus a large retail following in the USA.*4.Bosch does make OEM designed plugs using platinum, silver and other precious metals that should NOT be confused with their aftermarket Platinum plug series."
2,"Great stories, poorly written","The stories in the book are delightful, starting off with Mr. Ponzi and going into other amazingly true real life stories. Without repeating what others have said, this book could have been so much better. But the writing is dull, boring, and in short, there simply MUST be another book that is more pleasant to read. I'm a lawyer, and I feel like I'm reading an informative trial brief. Great stuff inside, but not very entertaining. Just my two cents."
5,Takin over Alright!,"The title of this cd said it all! I read the reviews from other listners and thought to give it a listen, great advice people. I really don't listen to hip-hop or rap, but what a great alternative. I recommend that everyone get a copy of this CD!"
5,Great book!,"The Triumph and the Glory is a very powerful novel, one of the best I've read in a long, long time. It has everything; memorable characters, heart-pounding action, tender love scenes, and a fast pace which grips you from the first page to the last. A new epic."
1,"this is really, really bad","How bad is this? It is just drivel. It is of the caliber of Danielle Steel. Scenes are barely set, and then the author launches into bad dialogue. It's is just really, really bad. No wonder no major publishing house would touch it and the author had to go to some rinky-dink press.Do not buy this book."
4,Good book.,"Unlike so many adventure or suspense novels that feel obligated to pile action upon action upon action, The Triumph and the Glory has a masterful ebb and flow to it. Softly lit love scenes balance the fire and fury of the battlefield. Betrayal and intrigue have their moments, but so do trusting committment and heartfelt farewells. I found this novel a delight to read. Its only weakness is that some of the secondary characters are pretty one-dimensional."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed The Triumph and the Glory. It is a well-written novel, a sort of upgraded and deeper ""12'Clock High"" for Generation X. The breadth of the plot covers more than the WWII airwar though, it weaves several strong subplots through the main story-line, introducing elements of conflict and tension with great skill, further developing the multi-level theme of this ambitious novel. I just wish Wilson Lindberg wouldn't have kept that promise!"
4,Impressive,"I was intrigued by the capacity of this novel to keep me mesmerized for 400 pages. The Triumph and the Glory is a world-class page-turner, a book that just keeps getting better as the passages unfold, the action builds, the tension rises, the suspense simmers, and the fate of Wilson Lindberg draws irrevocably nearer. If the first book in the series is this good what are the next few going to be like ? I can hardly wait."
5,Union and Confederate submarines,"The book is very good, full of information on Union and Confederate Submarine development. Very interesting. Keeps you informed on each side with their early development of the submarine."
4,There's more to it than the Hunley!,"This is a great book, and any enthusiast on the subject should have it available for the excellent coverage of non-Hunley issues. The coverage of Hunley in this book is as good as could have been assembled at the date of publication, but the recovery of the Hunley means a lot of new information has been discovered since this was published. I'm really glad I have my copy, picked up in a Charleston bookstore during a business trip soon after it was published. In 2003 the author published an updated edition that I haven't yet seen."
4,Good prep for the oral portion of your checkride,"Mr Hayes' guide is a good generic review for oral portion of the instrument (single-engine, airplane) checkride and covers required equipment (91.213, MELs), instrument errors and general procedures. Only the Gleim book has a more thorough coverage on topics.Any guide like this should be a supplement to a review with your CFI. Most examiners have particular areas they wish to emphasize -- usually based on previous applicants or trends from the FAA/NTSB inspectors. Also, your exam will certainly cover nuances of local flying. For example, Seattle has a lot of weird airspace, in addition to mountainous terrain (where minimums become especially meaningful), and a convergence zone reknowned for icing. These are covered only superficially in the book, but because they're local items you can bet that your examiner will want to see you understand these safety issues."
2,Doesn't accept wider sized bread products,"I should have returned this toaster because it just doesn't accept bagels and rolls like my old cuisinart did. I have to trim and shave until they will fit. What a chore. Something I don't feel like doing early in the morning as I'm rushing to get to work. It looks great on the counter top,though."
1,"Less A Toaster, More A Bread Warmer/Crust Burner","You really have to give a LOT of thought to the moisture content and thickness of everything you put in there, making this a difficult toaster to love. My husband is in charge of toast duty, since I find this one very frustrating. If you buy bakery bread, that has a darker crust you will have to cut them off after it burns them, because it will every time. Thinner bread will always burn too. If you stop it before the crust burns, the middle part will not be toasted enough. The setting button has a large range, but I cannot see ever using the highest setting unless the bread was soaking wet or something. It never fails to burn, and I stand over it each time, my finger above the 'cancel' button, worrying, fretting, and I usually end up hitting it at least once, starting it again and end up burning the crusts again! AAAAAAAGH!"
5,Excellent toaster,Beautiful brushed chrome toaster with lots of power. Does a great job on english muffins. Probably the best 2 slice toaster in the world.
2,for a small person,"Is actually too small for me to sit against and I am an average size person. The massage and heat work as described, the light is too dim to read by."
5,South Carolina Bands Hit It Again,"Like Edwin McCain, Hootie and the Blowfish, and Jump Little Children, Dezeray's Hammer is bound to be the next hot band to come from the Palmetto State. The CD starts out good with ""Shown the Way"" and is followed by 4 other songs that are perfect for a drive through the country. ""Praying"" the last track is in my opinion the best song on the album and a potential hit. SOMEONE SIGN THESE GUYS!"
4,My first Simon Clark novel... Won't be my last....,"WOW!!! IN THIS SKIN is the first of Simon Clark's novels that I have read (I know I know its his most recent but I am now ordering all his older novels) Really well written, filled with likable protaganists and nasty antagonists, creatures that are original and creepy. Clark makes you care about his characters and as the story unfolds you find yourself hoping that evrything will turn out ok... Clark keeps the story moving along and wallops you with a few surprises along the way. A really enjoyable, fun and creepy read. I will never look at a Crow the same way again ;) Try it... you'll like it!!!"
2,"Clark, In This Skin","When I read books, I usually just go by the title and what the author is known for. In Simon Clark's case, he is a horror author so I will read anything by him without caring what it is about until I'm actually pages in. In This Skin was a dreadful reading experience. I read the plot description after finishing and who ever wrote that little summary did a great job of selling this book. It sounds good, but I didn't enjoy any of it at all. As I usually say in my short reviews, the description is there for you to read and you don't need me re-wording it. I just say what I thought of the book as a whole and this one was a dud. I'm glad I'm not a slow reader. I didn't waste more than a couple of days on this."
4,Not scary as the first one,"I like scary games, 3d game, adventure games, but blood 2 was not as scary as the first one.I admit that there are better guns, movies, and graphics.Blood 1 had more monsters, but in blood 2 more cops.I heard that they wnat to make blood 3, and I hope that this time it will be more funner.But I addmit it was kind of fun, but ive seen better. :-)"
1,Rip Off,"This is a complete rip off. Very disappointed with this product. BELKIN... It's 2008. Does USB 2.0 Ring a bell?This is supposed to be an active extension. Who needs ACTIVE unless it's USB 2.0All Other ""Respectable"" products at the same price . Oh, if u still don't get it this cable will only give you 12mb/s instead of 480mbs. So it's a USB 1. I purchased 4 ... I threw them all out the window. NO one even wants to take them.Damn you Belkin."
5,Belkin USB Active Extension Cable,"I needed to attach a printer/scanner to my computer located about 35 feet away. Two of these active extension cables plus a 5 foot passive cable did the trick. The printer/scanner seems to work fine.I had previously tried a wireless printer receiver/transmitter and was startled to find that, while the printer worked fine, the scanner was totally inoperative. After searching the internet for solutions, I discovered the active USB cables which can be used to create a link as long as 85 feet. The cable was ""messier"" than a wireless connection, but it works."
2,Not for me,"To me, these shades seem to run on the darker side. The first jar I bought was way too dark for me. I finally got it right with the purchase of my second jar.I loved this foudation so much at first, I would actually look forward to applying it in the mornings, it was fun to work with. However, having middle aged skin I am not so sure that this is the best foundation for me. When they say matte, they are not kidding.On the positive side, this keeps my oily t-zone from shining all throughout the day and I never have to apply powder. On the negative side, it really tends to dry out my cheeks and make my skin look flaky and rough. I think this works best with a really heavy daytime moisturizer."
5,Quality product and delivery,"Product is up to all specifications. It was slightly smaller than I envisioned, but holds more than one stick of butter. It was packaged with more bubble wrap and boxes that I thought necessary, which is a good thing I suppose. I have had no problem in this cold weather with butter falling out of the keeper. The material it is made of seems to be of high quality. When I ordered it, 1 week before christmas, the package was late, which could be due to a blizzard in South Dakota at that time. After no luck in finding the package, I contacted the seller and told them it must have been lost in shipping. They immediately sent me a replacement and even overnighted the package. I was very pleased with this service. The package was likely lost by the company that shipped it, Fedex or UPS. I would recommend this product to anyone who like real butter."
4,A good ending,This book satisfies many unanswered questions left hanging at the end of Eugene Sledge's first memoirs. It offers a little known insite into what life was like for occupation Marines in post-war China. Well written. Worth the read.
4,China Marine Review,"This book offers a good insight into a veteran's experiences and feelings during the post-war in China and the adjustments required during assimilation in post-war America. Eugene Sledge was a remarkably tough, but compassionate, marine, who had the ability to verbalize his experiences unlike most men of his era."
3,It wouldn't be hard to improve,"I'm sure people have said this before, but for the second edition, the author should have dropped the 75 page story at the beginning. I'd rather have a book which takes up less room on my coffee table or have more quality content. This is a general overview of renewable technologies and doesn't offer much more than you can find in 10 minutes on the internet. With that being said, if you are looking for a place to start with renewables, this might be it. Just don't be disappointed if it leaves you wanting more."
3,Not what I expected,"Masters of Flamenco - Early Television Concerts was worth the price just to see what popular Flamenco looked like in the 1950s-60s. I had hoped to see some traditional dancing, but only got a lot of machine gun tachoneo. This technique, when used for most of the dancing, is strictly for tourists and television. The male dancers were trying too hard to look like Rudolph Valentino."
2,meh,When i played this game i found no real plot to it nor was there much fun to it...HOWEVER there is ONE little bit of interest. Jacking your character into the matrix of cyberspace. THat is where this game shines in my opinion the graphics for that is like 3 tiems what the rest of the game is like . However if you wish true rpg story and what not get the super nintendo version of this game. Great storyline in THAT one
5,I LOVE this CD!!!,"While this is definitely a departure from what we're used to hearing from Gary Puckett, it's no surprise that he recorded such a collection given the fact that he's a born-again Christian. If anything, his voice has gotten better with age & this CD is additional proof of his versatility as a performer. In addition to rock & ballads, he's performed blues, country, & just about everything else in between with the exception of rap & opera. This is a CD I'm looking forward to playing while decorating the Christmas tree. I still play it from time to time even now, because the music is really timeless. Nice work from probably the nicest guy in the music business!!"
1,This can't be the Gary Puckett I've loved,"Whatever possessed Gary to put out this album? It doesn't even sound like him or maybe he's just not good solo. Anyway, my advice is to not buy this album. I turned it off after the 1st song and will probably donate the CD to a charity."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"Other reviewers are correct in their analysis that this book is long on pop drivle and short on practical techinques that will help you get the score you need on the LSAT. While they offer techniques on how to go about disecting a problem, they fail miserably at giving decent examples.After I studied with this book and then took an official LSAC prep test, I came to realize that the Princeton Review answers were so incredibly dumbed down that my confidience was quickly shaken; the last thing you need when taking such an important test. Good luck in your studies and on test day!"
3,These aren't all sacred songs,"Although the title sounds like it fits the bill as a gospel song Patsy Cline's ""I Can See An Angel"" is definately an unrequitted-love song while her powerful and moving song about God ""That Wonderful Someone"" is absent in this and MCA's other two CD's of Cline/Lynn 'sacred' recordings ""Gospel Favorites"" and ""Just A Closer Walk With Thee"". I can't fault the artists or performances but the songs should fit the theme."
4,Radical,This book is radical and calls for fundamental change in our educational system. I happen to agree! No longer can we sit idley by and watch the power structure of our nation maintain status quo at the expense our children's future. Kincheloe exposes the greed and motives of our inherently racist and classist system. Cheers to Kincheloe for having the guts to point out our nations biggest flaw..... materialism and ambition for power.
4,"Accurate, but placement? A challenge!","I purchased 6 of these, to share (two at a time - freezer/refrigerator) with two friends/relatives. While all six were in my possession, I tested them and found they did not vary more than a single degree, all reading the same temperature when placed together.The problem lies with the placement. The newer refrigerators have glass shelves now, so the included metal hooks don't work there. Fine, in my case, in my freezer side, but I ended up using 3M magic tape to tape them to the glass shelves (just hanging below the leading edge) in my refrigerator.They have to be tilted up or down to read them. Not a major problem, but a loss of one star as a result. You can't see the red 'line' indicating the temperature by just looking - it has to be tipped until it shows.Accurate, and the price is right. Buy more for the same shipping charge, and share with friends."
1,unable to make useable,I ordered two of these thermometers. The instructions on the back say to hold the thermometer vigorously move your arm down to push all of the red stuff down to the bulb end and get rid of any separation. Good Joke. My family has attempted this multiple times over many days. Is last desperation I attached a string to the open one and whipped it around in a cirlce hoping centrifigal force would force the red stuff to go to the bulb end. Unsuccessful. What good is a thermometer if you can't shake it down? Highly unsatisfied.
2,Not like the original,"I too remembered this Record from when I was a child. But the song list is NOT the same as my original record. The artwork and CD are great to look at, but all in all, it's not what I was expecting."
3,"""Afraid?! A Sontaran afraid?!""","""The Sontaran Experiment"" may not be perfect, but for the first 2 parter since ""The Rescue"", it succeeds where some four parters fail. There are plot holes and flaws, but the obvious use of no padding really helps. Total location ""video"" footage helps as well. Kevin Lindsey's reprise of a Sontaran warrior is still unsurpassed. The regulars and the guests are in fine form. A nice follow-up to ""The Ark in Space""."
4,"It works well, but watch that blade","The slicer works really well and the blade options are useful in making spiral vs string fries ... have only tried potatoes on it and never cut fries so easy and quick.It's a snap to clean but pay full attention as you do. I moved my thumb to the blade to wipe something off the blade and moved it the wrong way ... instant sliced thumb. Still wearing the bandaid. Just rinse, don't try to knock anything off it.And you do get an interesting ""potato mushroom"" from the core and cap of the potato that remains after all has been sliced. All said, glad I bought it and would recommend it."
4,Great for the price,"The only negative thing I have to say about this product is that the slicer is hard to clean out. Upon shredding cabbage (which it did fairly well, until the prongs lost their grip on the end of the cabbage), some of the pieces got stick in between the plastic and the metal slicer, and it took a while to clean out.Otherwise, this product is great. It shreds/curls as it is supposed to, and I've already made beet chips, cole slaw, and zucchini pasta with it. It works great. Yes, it does leave some leftover product in the middle, but you can dice that up quickly and set it aside for some other recipe. Love the way this works."
4,Great product,"Ordered this item with the intention of using the noodles as a grain pasta alternative. I am so glad that I did. The children are still getting used to it, but I'm keeping with it. I've used this item about 4 times already. I typically use it for my zucchini and also have done sweet potatoes. It's simple...cut the ends off your veg (or fruit), center on the spike and corer, and twirl. The suction is very strong to the surface. It's easy to clean (I actually stick mine in the dishwasher) and the blades are extremely sharp. Great purchase."
1,Poorly made.,"I realized in reading the other reviews that this unit is plastic, not close to restaurant grade but I would have expected even a modestly priced light-duty unit to get through more than one potato before breaking.One Yukon Gold, one thin skinned, new potato was all that it could slice before the handle broke into 3 pieces in my hand.The basic idea of the unit is sound so I'll make a trip to the local home center and see if I can come up with a fix.God help anyone that tries a carrot or harder root vegetable."
5,Delicious!!!,"This product works just as promised. Once I understood the directions, it took less than a minute to turn my zucchini into beautiful looking spaghetti swirls - it truly looked just like green spaghetti, and was a perfect healthy, low-calorie and low-sugar substitute for pasta! It cooks up very quickly as well, and we were happily surprised to see how fast our dinner came to the table. My husband usually requests some kind of starch with every meal, but he commented that no bread, potatoes or pasta was needed with the zucchini spaghetti, because it is acts like pasta so well. This is a great buy for the price - we are so excited about this product!"
5,Ridiculously awesome,"This is my first spiralizer so take that into account - but I think this is my last one too! It's super easy to use, makes 3 awesome sizes of long noodle-y slices (that's before getting fancy with lengthwise cuts) and is very easy to clean. seems preferable to the joyce chan or whatever model because it can fit a foot-long veg. I love love love it and though my kitchen storage is tiny I'm really glad I added it to the arsenal."
4,Great vegetable slicer,"The price is reasonable for this kitchen tool. I cut up beets for salads and the slices were very thin.The blades are extremely sharp so be careful! You would use this tool for any firm vegetable or fruit. It won't replace other shredders or processors in you kitchen but I did find it useful. If you want to increase the raw vegetables in you diet try using this product and thinly slice carrots, beets, apples and enjoy!"
5,Very useful,"I just purchased this item and couldn't be happier with it. It's very easy to use, easy to clean as the crank piece slides off, uses no electric energy and I love that the other two blades are stored in the base. I have no complaints and can't wait to give this as gifts to my family members."
5,Good value and great for kids,"For the price, this is a great gizmo to have in the kitchen. I use a mix of zucchini, yellow squash, red onions, and red peppers with this for stir fries and also for pastas. You can slice onions for French Onion Soup with this much finer and faster than by hand and it's esp handy for making home fries and thin curly French Fries come out crispier than hand cut fries. It is a bit of a pain to get the food bits out of the crevices, but if you are cooking for four or more, this is a HUGE time-saver. By slicing the vegetables half way through length-wise, you get cut circles instead of spaghetti strands.My only real gripe is the plastic spikes on the turning handle seem a bit wimpy. Also this is a bit harder to use if you are left-handed."
4,Worked well but I almost lost a finger,"It worked well, i loved it. However I almost lost my pinky finger. My 13year old helped me make vegetable spaghetti and I'm just thankful I washed the dished. After I washed the dishes while removing my hand from the drainer the blade sliced the tip nails included) of my pinky finger in half. I was happy it was me and not my child's hand.I will still say that I'm pleased with this product but extreme caution is required when using it."
5,World Cuisine Spiral Slicer-encourages healthy choices,"One of my friends had one of these and told me how great vegetable noodles were. I purchased the World Cuisine slicer with low expectations. It works great. I make noodles out of Zucchini and Squash and use these instead of pasta for salads and warm with sauces. It is fun to make them and easy to use and clean.It has 4 suction cups on its base to hold it in place while the spiral slicer works. I watched this slicer demonstrated on U-Tube prior to my purchase. My only con to the slicer is that it does not come with a recipe book. However, there are several recipes and examples on Pinterest to try. No kitchen should be without one of these!"
3,Lousy Instruction Booklet,Be aware that the spirooli slicer comes with instructions that literally are useless. The slicer has three blades and the use is explained in photograps except the photograps are so dark that they are unreadable. Readable instructions are provided on the package itself but who wants to keep the package after the contents have been removed. Went to World Cuisine's website to find out whether they had any proper instructions posted there. None!!! Looked for recipes on World Cusine's website specifically for the slicer and found one recipe. As to be expected the slicer is made in China. Not too impressive!!!
5,Best invention ever!,I don't know about you but I get a little burnt out on spaghetti so I spiral up some zucchini for some low carb deliciousness. And it's works amazingly! You might need some kind of brush to clean the blades but it's well worth the buy if you like to eat your veggies!
1,Not for me,"The slicer was not for me. I tried cutting several vegetables and an apple. It seemed like more trouble than chopping with my chef's knife. Also seemed some of the fruit/vegetable was wasted in the tube like gripper. Possible I was using it wrong, but seems too simple for that to be the issue. I prefer a mandolin to this slicer."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"CHEAP VERSION OF WHAT I NEEDED.. SHOULD'VE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY AND GOT THE REAL THING. MAKES THICK SPIRAL CUTS, NOT FINE. USELESS TO ME. DON'T DO IT."
4,great item!,Love this product. I only wish it had 1 blade for a cut a bit more thick. The spagetti cut is awesome for mimicking pastas
4,As Advertised!,"Compact, well designed and uncomplicated; this little machine does just as advertised. I personally thought is was fun to use. It transforms a salad into a CULINARY CREATION."
4,Great addition to the kitchen,What a great device to add to the kitchen. Work fantastic. Cleaning and storage is easy. Perfect for my fall harvest.
2,Such a dissapointment...,"In high school I fell in love with Sweet Liar, and always wondered what would happen to Kane in his own story (because everyone knows in the world of romance novels, the unhappily widowed brother MUST have his own story). So I waited, and forgot about it, and just recently discovered that somewhere along the line, the tale had appeared.And after reading it, I cannot even begin to conceal my dissapointment. It's short, cursory and unrealistic. I can hardly believe the author who spent so much time and energy making Mike and Samantha lovable not only rushed through this leg of the adventure, but spared barely a glance at their matrimonial bliss.I have only one thing to say. Ugh. I've lost faith in Deveraux's ability."
2,Tennis no one,"Ok, maybe this movie didn't work for me because I am not English or because I really don't care anything about tennis. This is a stinker. It stinks worse than the locker rooms at the real Wimbledon probably stink. There is no spark between the two main stars and you find yourself just wishing Sam Neil (who plays Dunst's father) brought some of his friends from Jurassic Park along so they would eat the rest of the cast. Bettany, who saved A Knight's Tale from sucking, looks tired and not too impressed with himself in this movie. Dunst plays the same character she has played since she was a kid. Why can't she get hooked on drugs and disappear off the face of the Earth like all the other child actors. This movie, unless you really enjoy watching tennis balls go back and forth, is a total waste of time. I really recommend you go watch the Legend of Bagger Vance and watch white golf balls go back and forth instead of this movie. That was a joke because that movie sucked too!"
4,John deere,"This was nice, I don't like to be negative, I bought a lot of the John Deere stuff in a rush for the holidays"
3,Size matters,"I ordered the ""Woodstock Percussion AGLS Amazing Grace wind chimes."" I was expecting a much bigger product. The product description lists this item as ""Large, over 40 inches."" When I opened the very small box, I was so disappointed to see small metal chimes, even smaller than some of the other chimes I have on my patio. I was hoping to get a set of chimes that were 40 inches long. Going back to the description, I now realize that it was a description of the entire piece. So, the description is quite misleading. You get what you pay for I guess."
2,Amazing grace wind chime (Not),"It's a fine wind chime, but not us or any of our friends could discern any notes from Amazing Grace"
2,"Paid for a new one, received a USED one!","I paid $19.95 for this ""new"" CD. The one I received was NOT new. The case was taped closed with about 2"" of clear tape and it had a long scratch on the back. Apparently, the CD was returned by someone. I feel definitely cheated, as I had ordered new and received anything but. I did play the CD, and it plays OK, so I can't be bothered to jump through the hoops to return it, but getting a used item when I paid for a new item is not acceptable. I am very much surprised at Amazon for doing this, as my experience with Amazon has always been positive. Until now..."
4,Roy and Dale Cowboy Gospel - How Cool is That !?!?!?!?!,"Really great compilation CD - more Dale than Roy - but a great collection of classic cowboy gospel - this is the good stuff that is getting hard to find - make sure you pick up a copy for your collection - I could only find on CD, and that with some effort - have not seen for mp3 or iTunes download - get a copy if you can find it !"
3,Davidoff perfume,Nice scent. Not too powerful and not too boring. Actually ordered the wrong perfume...was supposed to order the 'Wave' but ended up keeping this for myself. Don't put too much on as it will be a bit strong. Spray and step into the mist and you are good to go!
5,Cool Water Purchase,The purchase from this vendor of Cool Water arrived within a week or so in good condition. I recommend using this vendor for further Amazon orders.
2,over rated,"This perfume is so overrated. It smells OK, the scent is not lasting and is too subtle. The male scent is far better. It is barely worn. Sorry I bought it"
3,It's okay,Each mission must be done without dying or killing bystanders or you have to restart the entire mission. It's kind of annoying if the mission have several objectives.Overall the detail is good. Game control is a little annoying but it's not that bad. I prefer Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon for the PSP.One thing bad for all three is how small the enemy can be. But with the tom clancy stuff I can look over my shoulder behind something or use a scope before opening the door. All three are pretty much at the same level. But this is pretty low in comparison.
3,A moderate sequel.,"Fireteam bravo two was a decent game, I really didnt like the fact that it all took place in one country. I was so used to traveling around in all the other socom games that this one kind of let me down. The missions were bland and repetitive. The only saving grace to this game is the multiplayer features. In multiplayer mode you can customize your seal or merc from a varitey of outfits/accessories which is better than the preset characters in the first one. If you are a fan of the first one and like using the crosstalk feature than I recomend this game, if you are a first time player of socom I recomend just buying the first Fireteam Bravo."
1,TOO MANY GLITCHES!!!,"Although this game is in my opinion, extremely fun, it has too many glitches. If you get disconnected from the network (and you WILL) you loose all the points you have accumulated unless you had a chance to save them first. Saving is not normal. There is a workaround (NOT A FIX) to be able to save gave data while in game play. If you try to go into a room that has ranking restrictions, you get a screen that advises you of it and then the game freezes. You then have 2 options; shutdown and go through the whole process of being back where you were, or disconnect from the network and wait to re-login. To me, it's an annoying process. Also, there are gameplay glitches that people capitalize on; hiding in walls and stuff. Not fun for others..."
2,more on the bad side than the good,"I think that this game is decent I bought it for twenty dollars at target and I think that It should be about ten because of the controls i like rainbow six vegas because you can control with the analog stick and look around with the circle, triangle, etc. I believe that this game has a great story and great graphics. there really isn't a point to the game it is really just walking on a path and people popping up and you shooting them it is very boring"
3,Pretty anklet,"This anklet is very pretty and the description matches the product. However, it does not stretch as much as I had hoped. I got it in the largest size, which is an 11. I like anklets that I can just slip on and off. I don't want to fuss with a clasp. I am of average weight, but seem to need larger size anklets and was hoping this one had more give. I can't wear in on my ankle as it is too tight, but wear it on my wrist, like a bracelet. It is too big for my wrist, but I wear it with several other bracelets, which keeps it from falling off. The crystals sparkle and the black beads look very fancy with the crystals. I will keep looking for a stretchy, pull on anklet for this summer. The product was shipped very quickly and packaged very carefully. I will look for more products from this seller that will meet my needs."
2,Donations Please,I am very disappointed with this book. Within the introduction I felt like I was reading ad after ad for donations so Geryl could go dig in the dirt. Had I bought it new it would have gone back. Guess I'll leave it at the laundromat! Not one I would recommend.
3,I'm not sure how good it works,Im not sure how good this product works. I have only been taking it for a couple of weeks. Hopefully I will see some results soon.
3,Good story without the epilogue and errors,"The story accurately reflects what can happen to someone who lacks love like Arley. I didn't care for the back and forth method between Arley and Annie. I would just get interested in the story line, but then we would get switched back to another perspective. The author could have done without the epilogue. It basically ties up the characters future for us in a mere mention. I also noticed the error which had Arley and the baby staying at charlies and the hospital in the same night. The author also had Annie inform her sister twice about her affair with charlie. The first time Annie leaves Rachael a message in code on her answering machine as to what she did. She was glad her sister wasn't home because she was ashamed. Then, the night before she visits stuart she calls her sister up and tells her again what she did. Overall the story kept my interest, but it was an average novel."
3,Just okay....,"This was okay but not a page turner for me. Was kind of boring in most areas and I also didn't like the different sections for Annie and Arley. Just didn't keep my attention. I wished the Charley Annie relationship was more developed. All in all it wasn't terrible, but I definitely liked her first novel better."
2,"Quality material, useless design","Had wanted a butter crock for years; fell in love with this one in cobalt blue. But when I tried to use it, discovered the design resulted in a difficult to use, unsanitary product. The insertion opening at the top flares out to a bottom. This means that unless you have a curved knife, it will be difficult to get all of the butter out. Worse yet, there is a small groove around the inside bottom that is exceptionally hard to clean. Love Emile Henry, but this design is all wrong. Took the ones I bought back to the store and let them know why."
1,this other book is *much* better,"Don't bother with this book; I bought it and was totally disappointed. Buy the book listed below instead, it's thick, full of information on all aspects on DJ'ing form beat-matching to equalizing to matching jeys, etc .. and it's even fun to read.How to DJ Right: The Art and Science of Playing Records by Frank Broughton, Bill Brewster"
1,Woak!,I order this item twice and both time the vinyl were curved!!!!I really tought that amazon was better then this.....
2,Required for MBA class,This book was required for my core management class and even our professor mentioned there are more effective books available.
1,"Not a great recording, even for Lawrence Welk","Got this for my mother in law. She'll probably like it and with her hearing aids she won't be able to discern the quality, but when she played it we thought it sounded like a pretty old, poor quality recording. Maybe that's what you'd expect with old original recording, but it didn't appear to be remastered or anything to update the sound, which was somewhat muffled. Would go with more Ferrante and Teicher CDs for her; even the old ones sound much better than this."
1,Not worth it.,"I was very excited to try it, but it was nice using nothing at all. Doesnt hold anything, I could have used gum and it would hold my cap better. Don't waste your time going to the store to purchase this product, its a waste of money. I wouldn't even give it a 1/2 of star."
1,A Waste of Money,"Bought this at walgreens, as I had a crown fall out earlier in the day. My dentist is out of town for a week, so I tried this product. What a waste of time and money! I followed the instructions to the letter. Tried 3 times. The first time, it lasted about an hour, the 2nd time I slept with it, and woke up in the morning to find the crown on my pillow. The 3rd time, I was very very careful and it lasted from the morning until lunch, when it promptly fell out when I started chewing. I even chewed on the opposite side of the mouth, but I guess all the jaw movement shook the crown loose. This stuff holds about as well as vaseline."
5,Fitted these KTM Gaurds on a DR-z400s,The package comes with the Guards and Guides .No guide Clamps.quality plastic and packaged wellI'd recommend them for replacement or modification as i did to my suzuki DRZ400
5,Fun for the whole family,"I bought this because my husband and I both enjoy the humor of Bob Newhart. When I introduced my children to it, they loved it, too. They enjoyed the cd so much that I have had to retrieve it from their rooms on more than one occasion. ""Introducing Tobacco to Civilization"" and ""Driving Instructor"" are our family's personal favorites, but the whole cd is a lot of fun."
3,Not up to JQ's usual standars...but still okay...,"First off, I think that there isn't enough of the letters to make the reader understand why Eloise went to Philip in the first place. Once she arrives, I don't think Philip is a very charismatic leading man. He's more interested in plants and ignoring his kids than Eloise. There really seems to be no spark between these two until way late in the book (like last 20 pages!) The bright spot is when other Bridgerton's show up - the Bridgerton brothers definitely steal the show and make us wonder why Philip couldn't be written as well as they are!I agree with other reviewers that this story seemed rushed. Too bad, since it had a lot of potential!"
2,Not with Bridgerton Style.......,"Julia Quinn is one of my favorite authors. Her books makes me laugh and cry at the same time. I wait on pins and needles for her next book to be released, and this one was no exception...After reading this book, I was somewhat disappointed. It lacked the luster of the other Bridgerton siblings has encountered. Phillip and Eloise seemed rushed to me.Where was the chase in the characters that Julia Quinn is noted for?"
3,Not her best work,"I was very dissappointed with the ending of the book. While the ending itself wasn't bad, it didn't leave me feeling happy. All the other Bridgerton marriages ended with a couple who could openly communicate to each other about any desire/concern/need etc. and this book took that open communication away with 2 paragraphs. If I could have skipped those two paragraphs the book would have been good."
1,Unlike any of the Bridgerton Series,"I read the first 150-or-so pages and I had to give up. I couldn't care less what happened to Eloise, Sir Phillip or his bratty kids. Initially, the story seemed like a cheesy version of The Sound of Music. Sir Phillip expected a woman to take charge with his children and help with the house but he didn't expect to fall in love. The only character more boring than Eloise was Sir Phillip! Perhaps that means they were a perfect match after all? There wasn't any excitement that I read about and zero romance. If Eloise wasn't a Bridgerton, I would have put the book down much sooner."
1,I'd give it no stars,"I have read all of JQ's, loved everyone of them. I am very disappointed in this book. Where is the depth in their relationship before the descriptive intimacy? Yuck. No words of love, no emotion of love, just sex. This has become very popular with some romance writers. The empty relationship, add empty sex, Whala, great relationship! Wrong. What is this teaching our kids. Sad! If it wasn't for JQ's writing style, I wouldn't believe I was actually reading one of her books. Julia always had depth, emotional relationship and humor. Sad."
1,The worst manuscript paper I have found.,"This paper is not cream colored--it's brilliant white.It's not heavy--it's very light and cheap paper.It's smaller than the other lightweight manuscript papers.Its lines are very indistinct--poorly defined.COMPARISON OF 4 BRANDS OF MANUSCRIPT PAPER--FOLDED QUIRES, 10 OR 12 STAVES:Mel Bay folded manuscript paper: 8.75 x 11.75. Light paper. Very white. Poorly defined lines.Passantino folded manuscript paper: 9 x 12. Cream colored. About the same light weight of paper. Much darker/clearer lines.Archives folded manuscript paper: 9 x 12. Light cream. Same light weight. Much darker/clearer lines.King Brand folded (Schirmer) manuscript paper. 9 x 12. Med. cream. HEAVY paper. Very clear/dark lines.BEST: King Brand manuscript paper.WORST: Mel Bay. If you want cheap paper you'll get bigger sheets with the Passantino or Archives."
1,fuel line disconnect tool... NOT!,"I purchased this tool to help with uhm well.. what its supposed to be used for. lol and well i have attempted to use it on a 99 s-10 , 2001 hyundai , 2003 dodge intrepid , 2000 ford focus , 2000 toyota corolla and more. . needless to say it doesnt work at all. i still have it and am waiting for at least one vehicle it will work for. if I indeed find a use for it other thank filling space in my tool box I will update this review"
1,Nice looking but never worked,I'm a big Carl Edwards fan and purchased this watch however I could never get it to work. I should have sent it back but it wasn't worth the postage.
5,Homebirth Advantage,"This book is great. It does exactly what it is intended to do, give the history of PHYSICIAN attended homebirth. As for the comment that they bring the hospital to you, there is absolutely nothing wrong with coming to a birth prepared. Would you rather have your provider say later, ""I'm so sorry, I wish we had brought..."" or ""Thank God we brought..."" It is not as if they routinely use that equipment but rather have it if they need it."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"This is a piece of junk. Have owned for 60 days & am now on 3rd sensor wire. Also, have had to replace a defective pedal. It did not work right out of the box. My biggest regret is not sending it back."
5,"great for Emergent Readers, even ESOL students!",Wonderful social studies series for emergent readers.
3,Lots of early recordings all collected in one place,"This import CD collects songs from different 7"" singles and EPs onto one CD. If you liked 'Ponyoak' or 'Sexual Harassment,' there's lots of good stuff here, and it's a good opportunity to hear the ultra-low-fi roots of KGW.Some highlights: ""The Price War Starts Here,"" ""Sunny Sunow,"" and the surf-rock-inspired ""Kill Devil Hill."""
4,easy&beautiful beaded small designs,"Beads add a beautiful new dimension to cross-stitch and this book makes it easy to do. It has around 100 very small designs: lots of hearts,flowers and baskets,cute little houses,angels,halloween and christmas ornaments. There are also around ten (a little bit larger)beautiful samplers. The charts are well defined with clear instructions. The designs are small but very charming and cute. I also used some of the designs for x-stitching without beads and the results were very pretty."
4,Lots of nice projects,This book has a lot of different and interesting projects in it. Something for everyone.
5,Mandatory for your next trip to Provence!,"As Americans making our first trip to Provence, we knew we should bring along a map with sufficient detail to guide us through the quaint hillside towns of this incredible region of France. We were never disappointed in our Michelin map - it allowed us to drive from town to town effortlessly, even on very remote (and narrow!) country roads. We used the map in conjunction with our France Green Guide, so we knew which towns we didn't want to miss. With a little planning on our part, we were able to see some of the most beautiful villages - including Les Baux, Lacoste and Bonnieux - without any fear of getting lost. We highly recommend this map!"
2,Map lacks an index!,"The map is extremely detailed, legible and accurate but is FATALLY FLAWED as, incredibly, it lacks an index!An e-mail to Michelin asking how long it expected travellers to scan perhaps 1000 names in order to locate an entry yielded the response that Michelin is . . . considering the problem. I am not kidding."
5,After using Colgate Total my teeth felt noticeably ...,After using Colgate Total my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than after using other toothpaste. It made my mouth tingle and feel fresh. I would recommend trying this product.
5,Good Toothpaste,Colgate is one of four toothpaste brands I use on a regular basis. I guess I've been using it since I was a kid. That fact that it has the American Dental Association (ADA) stamp of approval is important. My teeth and mouth always feel nice and clean after using Colgate. The only drawback is that it sometimes burns my mouth a little bit for some reason. But I continue to use it very often.Thumbs up for Colgate.
3,Fun Toy,"If your kids already enjoy playing with a Mr. Potato Head toy, they'll enjoy Spud Buds. BUT...DO NOT buy from this company! This toy was manufactured to sell for $9.99 NOT [...]It's a rip off!!!"
4,Wahl 5-Star Detailer,Absolutely love it. Small lightweight cuts very close and smooth. Have yet to experience a problem with overheating during continuous use. I definitely recommend this to other barbers
2,Only 3 guides!,"This trimmer only has 3 beard guides, and there aren't any additional available anywhere online. I even called Wahl factory direct and they told me that they don't make any additional guides for this trimmer. So if you only need 1/16"" - 3/16"" guides, this is perfect for you. But the guides just don't cut it. The 3/16"" cuts too deep and shows too much skin, and the 1/16"" guide might as well not exist because it just leaves a bit of stubble. The middle guide doesn't help much either. Decent trimmer hampered by terrible guides. I don't know why Wahl wouldn't invest in a few extra pieces of plastic to keep their customers happy. Going back to Norelco."
4,Great trimmer,"It's great on the hand; easy to hold, control, and maintain. Good for edging up or shaving and all that stuff. I messed up lining up my hair. NEVER EVER CUT YOUR OWN HAIR. ugh.. Anyways, a pretty good trimmer overall. :) 4/5"
2,Does not fit any other combs made by Wahl,"If you're looking for a great trimmer, this is it. However, you get very short combs and don't expect the other Wahl combs to fit. I even went to a hair supplies store where all the hair dressers get their equipment and they said they didn't have any combs to fit this model. I was dumb and threw out the box before I realized this. If I still had the box it would be returned."
5,A Pure Steal.,"I bought this only for the microphone boom stand.The microphone and cable were a bonus.They both seem to work...I don't think I'll use them for anything other than comedic show...or if I ever want to throw around a microphone I could careless breaking.It's a NADY SP1.These are $7 microphones.It's like using a Rockband or guitar hero microphone...I really hope you don't expect to record with it.While it's surprisingly good for it's price, it's no where near being top notch.The cable works fine, I don't have a need for it, but I'll find out if its high quality some day. (doubt, but I could be wrong.)You can find most mic stands from musicians friends to be around $20-$50.BUY THIS. BUY THIS. BUY THIS."
5,Great Product - Excellent Value,"We purchased this microphone for use at our church. It works perfectly, sounds great, and was a steal for 20 bucks!"
3,A useful elaboration of the distribution process,"The traditional stereotype of a ""Mom and Pop"" store continues to pervade generalist analysis of the Japanese retail sector. This book provides a welcome insight into the mechanics of distribution, as structural change is forced on the sector by external pressure - and by the changing demands of a younger generation whose values have metamorphasised away from the standards of their parents. Some of the retail systems (for example auto distribution) are shown to be more sophisticated and less inefficient than trade protectionist caricatures would have international observers believe. Inevitably, this is a book that is likely to date fairly rapidly given the changes pervading Japan's corporate economy and general society. Nonetheless, it is a useful snapshot of what was happening to an important sector in the midst of powerful forces for change."
5,TOO BAD SO SAD NO MORE,"I was enjoying this little series and then found out publishers didntpick up series.. So no more Kate...I agree similiar to Lee Harris, mystery Christine Bennett series...Its sad when publishers pick and choose who you can read, I was enjoyingthis series, not too heavy on murders that you couldnt sleep at night...But publishers also did this to Tim Myers Lighthouse mystery series...Will try the Kali series and see where it takes me....."
1,missed opportunity,"This is a truly poor book, which shows little sign of familiarity with the music it claims to present and presents the people of Africa and the East in stereotypical categories. It could be useful as an example of how Westerners continue to misunderstand and misrepresent other musics and, through that, other peoples. That's probably about all."
5,Fluidmaster works great,The Fluidmaster works great and the cartidges seem to last a while. The refills are somewhat expensive but I like the product.
4,Help keep toilet clean,I like this product because it dispenses some bleach in the toilet bowl everytime you flush. It really helps keep the toilet cleaner especially during the hot summer months.They last up to 3 months long .
3,"Nice idea, but most of the product is wasted","This is a nice idea, but the chemical is introduced to the bowl as flushing is performed. This means that most of the chemical goes into the bowl and straight down the drain in the same cycle. Very, very wasteful. This is especially obvious with the blue-colored (though less effective) chemical.It would be easier to tell when the product is depleted if some coloring were introduced."
5,"A combination of blues, jazz and hard rock",I love Ben Harper and this has to be his most creative CD yet. You can find Bens classc acoustic sound to high gain slide guitar to the delta blues and even some jazz. It is one of my favorites now.
1,Let people know this album is the worst,"I never write reviews for I am a silent user of amazon. yet, this time I must say something. This is the worst album by Ben Harper, a huge disappointment for all his fans and the only bad one. I can not really see how it could have been rated so highly by previous reviewers. Probably, they have never listened to anything else from Ben. Buy the first three or even the newest one, diamonds on the inside. This is not worth your money.8"
5,THOMPSON IS A TOOL,i can't believe this man.... i saw harper live and treated on the floor right in front of me..... yeah
4,"Great Lyrics, Great Music","Great lyrics and great music are a rare combination nowadays, but this album definitely puts them both together. The variety of sound is also quite astonishing. There are songs that make you just want to rock out and others that are purely contemplative. A great CD overall."
3,Thinking man's Lenny Kravitz,"This one grew on me with subsequent listenings. I purchased it on the basis of one song (Steal My Kisses) and was originally dissapointed. I for some reason remembered Ben Harper being ""folky"" (as was ""Steal My Kisses""), this album was dark and heavy (the guitars as well as the lyrics), not what I expected or wanted. I did find myself popping it in every few days, and eventually liking most of the songs. Much of it does seem reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz (of whom I am not a fan) but the songs seem more ""real"" to me.Why only three stars? On my scale thats pretty damn good. Only a handful or recordings ever get 5 from me, indicating perfect. 4 would be excellent, which though very good, this is not exactly my musical taste, and there are a few ""throw away"" songs presented. Overall I must admidt... a really good effort."
2,UN-Brainy Video,"I'm not a big fan of these types of videos in the first place. This video, claiming to be a ""logic"" sided brain tool, is drivel. There are tons of illogical things that happen on screen. Why to stacking rings get put on by an invisible hand? (We only see the shadow.) Why to objects instantly appear. ""It's like magic!"" But it's not magic, and it's not logical.Hey play with your kids yourself. Don't watch videos, go outsite. And most of all don't use these videos as babysitters. Never ever. ..."
2,Good concept but Right Brain is better for my 1 year old,"My daughter won't watch the left brain video but pretty much throws a party everytime I put the right brain on. The video just isn't very interesting. Parts of it are like ""D A D D Y"" spells Daddy. My 1 year old isn't ready for this yet and gets bored with it that she ends up giving up on the video. So we haven't made it through the entire video yet. Since I put the video on whenever I really need to get something done, I can't afford to have her become uninterested in it within 3 minutes. So I usually resort to putting on the Right Brain or one of the Baby Einstein videos (Mozart, Beethoven or Bach - the rest aren't as good)."
5,quite pleased,"On a whim I bought this game and have fallen in love with it.I have seen alot of complaints about the graphics but you are missing the point, This is the only surfing game that the moves are real. I mean come on, how many surfers do you know that can jump over a pier on a board? This game is minimalistic and basic which makes it great."
3,Same Old Stuff!,"As usual, Britney is great to look at and horrible to listen to. 3 stars is being kind really."
4,nothing new if you tuned in at album release,"4 stars because if you were a britney-watcher when ""in the zone"" was released, you've already seen the abc special and the trl appearance that make up the bulk of this dvd. that said, at the time, i wished i had taped them b/c once i had the album, i wanted to see her treatment of the songs. bonus cd is only ok--listener beware: ""don't hang up"" is not a very good song, but it's the kind that gets stuck in your head. all in all, this dvd is a must for britney fans."
1,I would give it ZERO.,"Ok, uh, um....? It's all the same. Same old stuff over and over. All she does is dance. She tries to make everyone think shes singing but shes not. What is up with that? Does she know shes going to mess up or something Who knows...."
2,"His Holiness, the Dalai Lama","It was a great message, very clear and good audio, but at times very difficult to understand and decipher His Holiness' accent."
5,Courage under fire,"Sitting in my comfortable living room watching, I couldn't believe the danger in which the film makers put themselves to bring the anguish of Liberia and its citizens to a wider audience. The footage is nothing short of astonishing as the camera navigates numerous gun battles to bring us to the heart of this, the second of two devastating civil wars. I later watched PRAY THE DEVIL BACK TO HELL and was astonished to find how much of its footage was actually taken from LIBERIA--AN UNCIVIL WAR (I'm not implying improper use; I'm certain all due credit was given). I applaud the directors and cameramen of this remarkable documentary for having the courage not to shy away from one of the most dreadful conflicts of the last forty years."
1,Don't Waste Time and Money,"This guide is so poorly done that I wasted valuable time and missed out on some wonderful experiences while on a short vacation to Paris. All the writer needed to do to make things easy was to include the arrondissement or section of the city when recommending a destination. I spend too much time scanning the maps, looking for the subway stop provided. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,Mediocre book and grating reading,"Far from being ""as exciting as a novel,"" this pedestrian re-telling of what should be a fascinating story is bland and far from insightful. The author's evident unfamiliarity with even basic military and naval terminology leads one to wonder about the accuracy of other elements. (A ship-of-the-line is a ""gunboat."") The Recorded Books version is read in a sneering, condescending delivery by an Englishman who whistles into the microphone every second sentence, producing a ""nails on the blackboard"" sensation which accentuates the discomfort."
3,Keep you warm but are kind of quiet.,"I bought these to replace a pair of 180's I lost. These are second to none to keeping your ears warm without ruining the 2 minutes I spend on my hair in the morning. My only complaint is that the max volume is kind of limited on these, especially since I listen to a lot of podcasts on the way to work."
2,Great idea...,"This is a great idea, but it is very difficult to keep the markers even and in place when drawing a music staff on the board. I usually end up drawing one or more of the lines by hand because at least one of the markers moves while in the holder."
3,For The Dedicated Student,"If instruction is what you need in a tutorial book then this is not the book for you. While the content is extensive and will take you from novice to expert, the beginning guitarist will struggle with the sparse instruction. Much is left to the imagination to figure out the point of the lesson. When there is explaination it is almost of no use as the author has tried to strip down any prose instruction to the bare minimum at the expense of usability. Although, once past the first several exercises progress will no doubt increase. Each exercise is designed to illistrate a specific element being taught, That said, the exercises struggle to inspire as they are often repiticious and mind numbing sequences of notes that have little 'song writting' quality. My suggestion is that this book is placed as a complimentary book to a more in-depth instructive book rather than a stand alone book. Try other publications first."
4,"Good book, if you have an instructor","It's a good book if you have an instructor. I'm taking lessons, and I've had some music classes before, so this book works for me. This book doesn't have a whole lot of text explaining things. I would not recommend this book to the total beginner."
2,Probably Won't Use Again,"I dislike this toothpaste because I don't think it lathers enough and because it didn't leave my mouth feeling fresh [it doesn't have much of a minty taste to it]. I do think that the price is very low compared to other toothpastes, though, but I don't think that is enough of an enticement to lead me to use it again."
1,Tastes like mint....yuck,"IT appears pepsodent altered the recipe. I have used it exclusively for years because it wasn't mint. Now it tastes like mint. At first I thought my taste buds were going through change of life, but after using an old tube from last summer I realized that the flavor changed. I detest mint and am frantically searching for another non-mint toothpaste!"
1,Did not work for me,My dog has terrible separation anxiety. I gave him 2 pills today before I left and it didn't work. When I came home he had ripped the carpet to shreds. Great.
5,Acurate,"As a child that grew up in the 50's and 60's era, I must say this book is acurate. What happened within a family stayed within a family. The events in this book are, in some ways, extreme compared to other families at the time. But, what happened at home, stayed at home.As I have not seen anything before written by this author, I will look for more books by her."
4,"These Gospel songs are great, but.....","These gospel songs are some of the best of all time. I remember when I was just a child, we had an 8 Trrack tape (telling my age here) and it had many of these songs on it. This is the ultimate version of ""How Great Thou Art"", and I always loved ""Light At The River"". ""Medals For Mothers"" is a moving beautiful song about a mother who has gone on to be with Jesus. It says ""I dreamed Mother walked up the heavenly stairs and medals for mothers were given up there"" and one line in the chorus that always gets me a little choked up says ""If there's medals for mothers, Mamma you'll win every one"". This song itself is worth buying the CD. The only thing that bothers me is why in the world would they put ""Will You Be Loving Another Man"" on a Gospel CD? While it is a great toe tapper of a Bluegrass song, it doesn't belong here."
5,Love this video -- U2 at their finest,"Don't have much to add, except that when the DVD of this is eventually released, I hope they add back in the extra songs -- I remember seeing this on Showtime a few times the fall after it was filmed and it was much longer than this.Those of us who were in high school (I was in 9th grade when this aired originally) remember how great it was to discover U2 because they sounded like nothing else on the airwaves at the time. Haven't listened to them seriously since ""Zooropa"" but this video and the accompanying LP (yes, I still have this on vinyl!) are always a great trip down memory lane. And the music still stands up -- all these years later."
2,disapointed,"the whole concert was disapointing, vocals, camera shots, excitment from the crowd, song list. I wounder why they chose this concert to film, the weather was so bad. I watched this once and traded it in."
4,U2 show from 1983 - very good,"This show dates from 1983, and was filmed at Red Rocks in the USA - a natural amphitheatre that provided a memorable backdrop for this, U2's first concert film. The best feature of the performance is the very strong connection U2 evidently makes with its audience. You can feel the energy and intensity in the band's playing, and the strident tone of their War album tracks like New Year's Day and Sunday Bloody Sunday is complemented by effective older tracks like I Will Follow, 11 O'Clock Tick Tock and The Electric Co. This music really did lift U2 to the top of the rock music world , and deservedly so. No one else in 1983 was making such strong guitar-based rock music, and U2 here were still young, charismatic, improving and developing an expanding fanbase. Highly Recommended."
5,Great concert film!,"I work at my local PBS and I admit, I got this for free, because we aired the video if I remember this past spring. Anyway, I have the CD of the album as well and this is just a beuatiful piece of work from the guys from Dublin."
1,Broke in First Week and repeatedly after,"This product is probably the single largest disappointment in our child's 3 years! In the very first week, the cable to the parent bar broke. So we got a replacement after much debate and protests by their customer support. Then, something went wrong with the handle bar and that does not turn the wheel anymore.Try explaining these to a 2-3 year old!I cannot believe that this company and this product are still in business with such a shoddy product"
1,Spend the Money - Get A Kettler,"Like some other reviewers, my wife and I thought that the name Radio Flyer was evidence enough of a quality product. We couldn't have been more wrong. This bike is hard to put together, extremely wobbly, and, in my opinion, unsafe for smaller children. After our son managed to tip it over for the second time we diassembled it, returned it, and spent a little more money on a Kettler, which has proven to be a fantastic purchase."
2,Not worth the money,"I have not had any steering problems with this bike, but, when your child is old enough to ride on his/her own, this bike will tip over at the slightest turn or incline with or without the handle attached. It is so top heavy with the child on it that it can only be ridden in a straight line and on a flat road. It's very dangerous and I would not recommend it to anyone. My 4 year old, that rides a two wheeler now, tips over on this when he plays on it. It's just designed to replace your stroller not to teach a child how to ride a trike. Look for something much lower to the ground."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!,"1 - Has NO SEAT BELT!!! I pick this item becasue my girlfriend had. Her's had a seat belt and you could steer w/ the handle. This model 47 (which looks the same as my girlfriend same price)Does not offer any of this. I called Radio Flyer to complain, how could a toy like this which they recommed for 2 year olds not have a seat belt. They had nothing to say you can't even buy one as an extra. So I wasted my money, and now I am going to have to buy one that steers and has a seat belt. Becasue this is so hard to move and the seat is sooo tiny he slips of the seat..."
3,Nice continuation to Volume I,"The book is a very interesting continuation to the first volume of the metrokin archive. I would howerver like to point out that at the middle of the book the form of writting of the book becomes very dull because all the charpters are prepared in the same way. To be fair probably from a scientific point of view this is the most correct form to do so, however at some point the reader becomes a bit bored. Chapters that speak of Iraq, Syria, Israel and Afganistan are very interesting, specially because they purport the russian or soviet point of view for strategical analisys. Nevertheless its a good book and provides good information."
3,Darkness At Noon,"Darkness At Noon was, for me, hard to understand at times, but was still a good and worthwhile read.Koestler was able to portray Rubashov with stark reality. Rubashov's talking to himself gives you a good picture of how he is torn between loyalty and dislike for the communist party. However, his shifts from present to past and back again could be confusing at times.The book also shows the difference in beliefs between people in the Soviet Union. The best example of this is when the prisoner in cell 402, a monarchist, taps to Rubashov, ""Bravo, the wolves devour each other""."
5,A Powerful Work,"This is a powerful work of fiction which is mostly fact in its nature. It is the story of Communism and the men who made it. It is also an examination of a man caught in a trap which he himself created. Rubachev, facing death at the hands of the party and system which he was instrumental in creating, is forced to look back at his own treatment of others in the same system.The protagonist never seems to be able to come to an understanding of what is right. His last thoughts are not that the intellectual basis of his belief system was utterly corrupt, rather it s that he would rather have studied astronomy.This book is necessary reading if one wishes to understand the totalitarian mind."
3,Darkness At Noon by Koestler was okay for its time,I read Darkness at Noon many many years ago and loved it. A re-read of it was somehow disappointing. Someone reading it for the first time would probably find it fascinating.
2,Not as good as it looks,"This looks like a sturdy manifold, being made of solid brass, supposedly. I installed one outside one of our rental properties about three years ago, but one of the hose outlets has parted company from the body, so I've junked it.The Gilmore equivalent is a little more expensive, but I'd guess it is better made, and it has a lifetime warranty. I've bought a number of brass Gilmore fittings over the years, and none of them has failed. One that is at the back of my house has been in use for seven years, and is switched from one side of the ""Y"" to the other about every two weeks in summer. It still works perfectly.By the way, for those with freezing problems, the later type of non-freezing exterior faucets will drain as soon as the faucet is turned off, even if a hose is attached."
1,It breaks!,"I didn't think this would break since I thought it was solid brass. After one year, the hose connection second from the left broke off. Because I needed four hose connectors, I added a 'Y' connector to one of the three remaining, but this was additional cost. I would not recommend this product."
3,Bring it in out of the cold,"When I first bought this item, it worked just as I had hoped. The valves were easy enough to open and close and it didn't leak. It's not a complicated item so there's not much to review. The problem comes as others have said, if you leave it out in freezing temperatures. I assumed that since it was brass, it would tolerate the cold. Unfortunately after just the first winter, it has developed a hairline crack across the manifold. So my recommendation is that if you buy this product, bring it indoors as soon as the temperatures start to hover around or below freezing."
2,Always breaks in same place,"After my first one broke, I foolishly bought another to replace it. It broke in exactly the same place. The threads are actually a separate piece that is welded on and it busts off, leaving the whole unit to spew water. I'm looking for a more durable one, or at least one that costs less if they last less than a year anyway."
1,Body sprung leak after one year,"I purchased this manifold during gardening season in 2011. When I hooked it up to the faucet this year and turned on the water I observed water squirting out of the main brass body -- a pin prick hole, but definitely squirting out 3"" more or less depending whether any of the 4 valves are open. Last summer one of the valve knobs broke off in the valve making it unusable. At least the valve was closed, and I figured I never used all 4 at the same time, so now that this hole has appeared... One star is too much considering less than one year of use and two serious manufacturing defects in a solid brass fitting. I have other brass hose adapters that I have used for over 20 years and they still do not leak. That is why I pay the price for solid brass."
2,Gilmore on James Dean,"John Gilmore attempts to dispel the myths that have accumulated surrounding Dean, yet he only succeeds in creating new and less endearing ones. Gilmore also refranes completely from expressing any care or affection for his friend, at any point in the book.If you can get past the clumsy prose, all you are left with is yet another person trying to cash in on the Dean legacy."
4,My teeth ARE whiter...,"If you were ""turned off"" by Mentadent when it first came to the market - this is better than the stuff you remembered. The pump has been significantly improved, and the taste is improved. It still tastes a bit like peroxide - but that's the stuff that whitens your teeth - and I have noticed a difference since I've started!If it had ADA approval, I'd give it five stars."
1,This book is crap!,The errors in this book toatally overshaddow any positive sides it may have. I'm using it to prep for the Math IIC right now and it's frustrating the hell out of me. There are so many mistakes it should be called back. Don't buy it -- you'll be better of just reviewing your course material.
4,Sci-Fi without overdoing it.,"Chris Bunch and Allan Cole do a good job of creating an interesting new Sci-Fi series. The main character is well conceived and interesting enough to want to follow along. The important thing is that the authors present the future in a way that makes you feel like it's not totally fictional, but don't spend too much time on science theory that you feel like you are reading a textbook.Sten suffers through a traumatic youth after his family is killed in a freak industrial accident turned deadly due to corporate greed. He is a gifted young man and the author does a good job of leaving him very vulnerable while allowing him to succeed. To me this makes the story that much better because he is not able to instantly triumph.On the whole, Bunch & Cole do a good job of setting the stage for a this series and giving us a taste of the adventure and drama that make readers want to come back for more."
5,Funny!,"Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouqet) demonstrates the unique hilarity that can only be found in British sitcoms. The process of keeping up appeearances always produces situations that leave Hyacinth completely embarassed. In spite of her mishaps, Hyacinth is quick to let one know that she 'knows her duty'."
4,Cute,"This CD is really cute! From ""The Wedding Singer,"" This song is really funny too. I would reccommend this CD to any fan of pop music! It really made me laugh and cheered me up when I was sad!"
3,It was a gift,I gave it as a gift. It seemed to me to be fine but I'm not the one that's going to use it.
4,Not a bad little golf toy for cheap,"The pocket washer is a cool idea. It actually does fit very easily into your pocket and it actually does not leak (at least it hasn't yet!). It doesn't do the best job cleaning the ball, but at least it gets it moist enough where it's easy to use a towel to wipe it all off. Certainly not as effective as the traditional on-course ball washers, but it comes in handy and is useful for me since I play at a course that does a very poor job maintaining the on-course ball washers."
3,Good,"I had read the excellent Amazon reviews on Motorola SB4200 and decided to go with one. After I bought it, I plugged my cable service to my USB outlet on the modem, given my MAC and SN id to Comcast and voila within 5 mts, i was up and running. Its been excellent so far. Although, the only glitch (that i have yet to figure out) is that the Activity LED for some reason will stop blinking and my internet connectivity will enter a ""freeze"" state upon which i have to power off/on my modem. I cannot seem to ping my DHCP gateway during this state. Not sure if this is the Comcast or a Motorola glitch. Upon powering back on though, service is restored. I have had to do this atleast once a day. This is regardless of whether i use the STANDBY feature. I am hoping there is an easy fix for this."
3,Deceptive,"I was expecting to receive a 15x24 inch standard AC filter with the cardboard edges. However, this product is just a 15x24 inch piece of paper that arrives folded over on itself 4 times in a tiny box despite what the picture looks like (and, actually, upon closer inspection of the picture on this site you can see that it's a small little box by the ratio of box size to the size of the hole on top of the box that you hang the box from in the store). If I could turn back the hands of time, I'd save my money and buy a real AC filter and not an over-sized paper towel."
5,fantastic quantity and quality,"If you can only afford to buy one kicking instructional DVD, get this one. Sang H. Kim works progressively from the very basics (front kick, roundhouse kick) to combination kicking, jumping kicks, spinning kicks and multiple kicks with the same leg, which I've never seen my instructor teach. What I love about this DVD is that I can use it to learn and get pointers on some of the intermediate kids while my son, who is a black belt, learned a whole bunch of new jumping kicks that he couldn't wait to show off to his black belt friends. A nice bonus is the way the menu is set up - you can chose the kick you want to learn or practice and go right to it rather than trying to fast forward or rewind to find things. It's a small detail but saves lots of time and frustration when you're working out and don't want to waste time fiddling with your remote control."
4,Tasty... different.,"Wow! This chocolate is packed with punch but not really what I expected. It was more muted peppery flavors instead of harsh bite. It was really a nice combo with the dark chocolate. Not something I would crave or try regularly, however."
3,I guess I just don't get it....,"It started out interesting enough, but towards the middle I got absolutely bored. I have no idea what I just read."
5,This book was incredible.,"This book was incredible. I finished it earlier this afternoon, moments made me cry, moments made me laugh, but mainly it made me think, about everything.Thank you for sharing your story Mr. Karlson, it was an honor to read it. And thank you for providing the material for my mind to take such paths it would not have other wise. I will tell everyone I know to read it, as well as my literature teacher, I have a feeling he may love it as well."
1,A Joke,No one should have to pay money for this.iPods for Windows should be 100% compatible or else return it.Don't pay money for this software; it's a joke.
1,Suggest Getting A Mac,"just a friendly suggestion. look into getting a mac computer. its easier, more reliable, and much faster. i have a 10 gig ipod and a powerbook and the ipod runs PERFECTLY and oh so fast. just a suggestion to make life easier and much more fun."
5,An author who blends real life with academic research,"Finally, an author who tells it like is is ! Hanson's real life experiences blend with his academic research to produce a book that has practical application both professionally and personally. His master of the difficult art of telling parables adds a dimension to this book that is missing in other books on this topic."
2,Leave This One Alone,"Dull, ploding, with a story line of only mild interest. This one is best left on the shelf. LMB has much better offerings. If you have a couple of hours to kill then go for it. This one you will be able to put down anytime you need to."
3,Not for homophobics,"I quite enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book, but the last 3rd let me down. The concept of an all male planet based on the idea of a monastary was well done. The Athos prejudice against women was a bit on the strong side until you consider that, after all, the planet's residents had never seen women in their life. To them, heterosexual sex would seem disgusting because they had no knowledge of it or of the female sex. To be sure, Athos isn't a planet I would ever want to be even near to, but their attitude towards women would be as natural as our attitude is toward those who are totally alien to us.My disappointment with the latter part of the novel stems from my feeling of just plain tiring of the characters. I would still recommend it to most science-fiction readers, but not as strongly as CETAGANDA."
3,Read it for leisure,"I found the premise interesting and it could have been a solid novel if Bujold weren't just taking a foray into B-movie humor. Still, it was fun.Forget Ethan, I want more of Elli Quinn. I was expecting more development on Elli in future novels but unfortunately Quinn's character development, along with a handful of the other mercenaries, has hapharzardly been pre-empted by Miles lethargic romance trilogy. How sad..."
3,first look,upon view i thought the pouch had a belt clip or some way to fasten to my belt but this was not so. apart from that i still do enjoy my pouch.sherwin.............
2,Not at all helpful,"I bought this book with the idea that it would improve my performance on the LSAT. I have to say that the structure of the book is really poor. It tells you to skip test questions, which does not seem to be a very intelligent concept. It also tells you to guess on anything and everything you get stuck on, because you can come back to it.I think that this is bad advice. The whole idea of taking the LSAT is to test what you know, not a guessing game. I will stick to practicing on the ""real"" tests like the ""10 More Actual, Official LSAT Preptests"" provided by LSAC. This book is boring and lacks helpful information, unless you think guessing is fun. And if so, go ahead brainiac, waste your hard earned dollar."
3,It was ok,"It was just ok, I mean ""The 60's"" was absolutely amazing so I thought I would get this, which is made by the same people. But no, this one was just ok."
3,rewind,"I was happy that you were able to replace the CD after it got lost in the mail.Thank You,ishie108@yahoo.com"
3,"Useless as a guidebook, mildly entertaining otherwise","I wanted to like the book, but was gravely disappointed. I was originally going to rate it two stars--I raised it to three because the author seems such a nice guy! The book consists of fifty sets of two facing pages, each set devoted to a bird. On the right is a painting, usually showing a side view of the bird and nothing else. On the left is a page of text on the bird, usually an anecdote about the author's experience with the species. Most of the stories are very dated, from the 1940s or 1950s. I find the book mildly amusing to leaf through when I'm bored, but it is no use as a reference, didn't challenge or inspire me, and I wouldn't dream of taking it into the field. There are much better uses for your reading dollar."
4,Miss Manners on Washington D.C.,"""Gilbert"" is the charming, moralistic tale of ayoung man who wants to climb the ladder of political success without having to to deal with all the pesky politicians and citizens. Martin's use of pleasant sarcasm and a straightforward moral make this book a nice, amusing read."
3,A Little Top Heavy,"Easy too use, and easy to carry due to lightweight. When fully extended in height has a tendency to lean forward."
1,5 bags not 10,"Even thought the page on Amazon clearly says (as of my order date and several days later on 05 October 2009) this product is a 10-pack of bags, they only sent a 5-pack. The shipping was prompt enough, but sending only half as much product as advertised is a no-no.Edit for clarity: this item is offered by several Amazon merchants; this incorrect order was handled by B & M Housewares."
2,A Sub-Par Platformer,"As a huge fan of Batman, I was really let down when I played this. The platforming levels are repetitive with stiff animation and weak fighting, as you can *only* punch. The driving levels are tough to follow, are not fun and also have bad animation. The boss encounters are confusing and redundant. The only high points is the cool scrolling Batwing shooting level and Robin's ""Metal Gear""-esque level.The sprites are tiny and stiffly animated and the sound is just plain bad. It isn't the worst Batman game of all time, but it still could have been a frickin' heck of a lot better.-RoB"
3,Nice look. Frustrating gameplay.,"Being a long-time fan of both Batman and side-scrolling games, I thought that it would obvious that I'd enjoy this game. The slideshow style visuals, used to tell the story, are beautiful. The actual in-game graphics are nice too, but the game elements could have been designed to be a bit bigger. On certain stages, enemies and other hazzards can be difficult to see.The most frustrating aspect of this game, however is the way Batman reacts to his environment. The edge detection seems to be off slightly, causing Batman to plummet to his death more often than he should. This wouldn't bother me so much if the gameplay didn't rely so heavily on planning precice jumps from platform to platform, all while avoiding enemies and other hazards.If you think you are the kind of person who can look past the wacky environment physics, the game is fairly rewarding. I just wish the developers took some clues from other games that got it right."
4,Great introduction to piano,"This book introduces students to reading music in a gradual way. It does show pictures of the notes which, though possibly a crutch as viewed by traditionalist music instructors, actually helps younger children get the feel of the notes and where they are on the keyboard. My son has been using Hal Leonard for over a year and is finishing book 2 and reading the music very well.By contrast, the Suzuki method of piano doesn't introduce music reading until much later in the program.I also like the accompanying CD. It helps my son to listen to and then play with the melodies and accompaniments. I would recommend this book and the Hal Leonard series."
4,could be better,The game is pretty good but you do the same things over and over again so it gets boring fast
1,Cult Leader,"This man is currently in trouble for sexually assaulting men close to him. I went to his school for 1 year. The ministry is completely corrupt and his church is a cult, not a ministry.Everyone on this page that has commented on the book is one of his followers or is working for his ministry. His cult has been dwindling and for years since I left. Many lives have been hurt and families have been broken by his sexual and monetary crimes."
3,Enjoyable,"I've been exploring the past CD's of the Bacon Bros recently, ever since buying their latest, ""New Year's Day"". This CD has some really beautiful songs like ""Ten Years in Mexico"", which is reminiscent of a James Taylor type song. I liked the deepness of the lyrics in ""Chop Wood"" and the loved humor in ""T.M.I."" I also really liked the cover of ""Don't Look Back"", one of my theme songs, esp for this year. I put all the above mentioned songs on my MP3 player."
2,Not what I expected mr. kevin b. and that other brother who no one has ever heard of or cares about.,"Man, I just bought the footloose soundtrack and i can say there is diffenitly a soundtrack that makes you jump up and hokey. this isn't only kevin sings. the other guy just sits there. How do i know? halfway through the first song i hear him pull up a stool and then breathe very uncomfortably heavy. but this cd isn't just full of bacon and breathing it also has some very sexual inuendoes. like the song ""chop wood"". is it about a lumberjack or something obscene? no ones knows, but in this song the stool man tries to sing and then kevin yells at him. I wanted to give this one star but i keep thinking about footloose and how good that was. aw now i'm sad."
5,This Majestic Land,"The music of Michael Hoppe comes from the heart. He writes with passion and sensitivity. In his last release ""Solace"" one of the outstanding compositions which I love is ""This Majestic Land"".Whenever I listen to it, memories of a trip to the beautiful landscape to the American West, Yellowstone, The Grand Tetons, Mount Rushmore and the wide open spaces of Wyoming come to my mind. The music of ""This Majetic Land"" is powerful and grand, truly a tribute to America."
4,Inspirational,"First track could be a county's anthem, very nicely performed. The remainder of album is inspiring, and much like Hoppe's other works."
1,AAAhhh!!! Honey I shrunk my head!!!,"What is up with the head on this guy? It's like half the size of my pinky nail and he's about and inch or two shorter than my other scout class figures! This is one of those figures that was cool in theory, but in reality it should have been made in a deluxe class or not at all. Only recommended for Legends Class collectors!"
1,Garbage,"This product is not only cheap but dangerous. I am 145 lbs and use it for in-place jogging......8 springs have broke so far! Not to mention when they do break, they shoot small metal pieces off in all directions. I have dents in my walls and cuts to prove it. This is a classic case of you get what you pay for!Stamina 38 inch 4-Way Folding Trampoline"
3,"doesn't ""fold for easy storage""","This is probably a great trampoline if you have room to leave it open all the time - the reason I finally decided to buy it, however, was because of the description that says ""folds for easy storage."" This is not at all true. I took this to mean that I'd be able to fold it up when I wasn't using it - what it actually means, however, is that if you want to store if for long periods of time, it folds (after a lot of effort) - not that you can fold it each time you're finished.Folding this trampoline requires the use of ""two strong people"" according to the instructions, and they're absolutely right. One person alone could not do it without risking having the trampoline snap together ""causing injury or death,"" also according to the instructions. So unless you're willing to unscrew 6 legs, take off the band that wraps around the edge, and have someone assist you with the very difficult task of folding this trampoline, you should plan to leave it open all the time."
4,Toothpaste alternate source,"Used to buy at Walgreens. They stopped selling it, so had to find another source ('course just after the submission, one of the local Wal*Mart's began selling, but lend no credance to continuation.) Prefer a reduction in shipping cost, but it is a viable source."
5,Best toothpast ever,"I don't know why Topol toothpaste is so hard to find in stores? It is the best ever. I cannot use another brand as they just do not get my teeth clean. One doesn't need to put much on the brush, & that prevents the white drippy mouth too. I sure hope Topol never stops making this product! cc"
5,Sound Off Priority Plus Light Module -- Great Product,This module works great.Installation was straight forward after I looked at the wiring diagram for my Yamaha.Only issue is there really isn't room on my stock XV700 to mount this under the seat.I ended up mounting it inside the tool compartment on the left side of my bike. Just moved the tool kit to the sissy bar compartment. The rear of my bike glows now since installing red turn signal/driving light lenses and this module.And the momentary flashing riding lights at braking is perfect.
1,Burnt Taste,We have tried many of the Tasy Bite entree's and enjoy most of them. When we tried this one we were unable to even finish it. The spinich had a very overcooked taste; almost a burnt flavor. It was so bad we threw away the rest of the case.
2,"Way too much salt, but you can survive on it.","It tastes strongly of canned spinach, and has too much cumin, but the biggest problem is the salt! Huge amount of salt. So much salt is just not necessary."
3,Stores conveniently? I disagree.,"The description states ""stores conveniently"". In my opinion, it is not convenient to have hundreds of beads in a shallow box with no lid. I really like Melissa and Doug toys, but lately I've been buying a lot of little storage containers for my various Melissa and Doug toys. It's getting expensive and time consuming. I just wish these things would come with a sliding piece of plastic or a cardboard box. Something to contain the contents."
2,No easy way to store as is.,"Beads are made in China, if you care about that.The storage of these beads is immediately difficult, as the only thing that covers the box is plastic ... which you'll need to remove to use the beads. THEN what do you do with this open box of beads?Because there is hardly any protection on top of this box the way it is packaged for sale, some of the beads were scuffed through the thin clear plastic. They were clearly scratched or rubbed by something even though the plastic was still intact."
1,Batman Vengeance,"I really looked forward for this title. I love batman always have and always will. The game has the same actors as in the show. That is a plus right there, but that's all. I'm really sorry about that everything else is so really bad. You will not be given the freedom to control batman like you thought you would. The environment to move around in and interact with is so controlled. It gave the feeling of really not being there. Just want to end the review with could of been a great game for me, but was really disappointed, maybe you see something I did not for right now I'm going to the Store to buy a new game. I bought batman yesterday"
1,Blah!,"You know what, sometimes I wish I could give a game zero stars... maybe even NEGATIVE stars!! If this tells you anything I think about this game, then your a quick one! I bought this and in about the time it took me to get home, and try it... I had already started it on fire-literally! Here's the thing if you enjoy pissing away your money, then buy this P.O.S!-Tony Natysin, questions call 763-420-2908"
3,An okay Game,"Batman Vengence ranks only slightly higher than the PS2 game Orphen (Which I cannot even give away), and for the same reasons, just less severe.There are two problems that keep this game from being a great game (besides the pathetic gameplay). The first is too many FMVs (Full Motion Videos) and not enough play. It seems like 70% of the time I am looking at a movie, or a progressbar (I hate watching statusbars, anyone who is in Electronic Pre-Press knows why). And if that wasn't bad enough, the graphics are not the quality one should expect of a PS2 game."
2,Advertising needs to be corrected,"On every web site's description of this item it says ""The machine offers six pre-programmed workouts: fat burn, maximum fat burn, hill, interval, mountain, and aerobic."" I bought the machine for these pre-programmed workouts. When I got the machine I found out that there are none of them! I called the manufacturer directly, only to be told that this machine has never had them! They replaced the machine with another one that does have pre-programmed workouts, postage paid. They were a pleasure to deal with. And I love my elliptical!"
4,So far So good!,I love this elliptical. It's reliable and gives me a great workout. It's definately not the kind you step on at the gym but it's a good quality with a great price!
4,Really like it however,I really like this machine and feel it gives a great workout.This machine does not have any programs installed.The pulse monitor is very good and assembly was easy.I bought this model for budgetary purposes.I will purchase a higher quality in the future.
4,review,"I have only had mine for about a week but I think it works great! It was easy to assemble, with some already done for me. I noticed someone mentioned theirs moved, I put a yoga mat under mine and it does not move, and makes little to no noise. I feel it in my arms and legs and I just think it does work. I also purchased it so it would be less stress on my knees, but I still have to wear my knee brace. It is better than a treadmill though if anyone has similar problems."
2,Not so silent,I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical. It took me a day and a half to put together. The meter didn't work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately. It makes a lot of noise and it's not very sturdy. I would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble. I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,No es lo que anuncian...,"El disco no esta tan mal, pero las canciones que anuncian no son las que vienen en el cd. son otras canciones totalmente diferentes, yo esperaba canciones como:- Tu y Yo somos uno mismo- Besos de Ceniza- Como te dire- Soy un desastre- Rompecabezasy otras tantas mas, pero de estas no viene ninguna !!! :-( al contrario vienen otras como:- Muriendo Lento- Yo no Soy una Mas- Vanidosa- Todo o Nada- Sacudetecomo fan de TIMBIRICHE me quede con el cd. ya que no tengo estas canciones en cd. pero asegurate de que las canciones que anuncian sean las que en verdad vienen en el cd."
2,Try something else,"This video (note, only 30 minutes long) suffers from poor camera work...angles from the rear are rare and make the forms tough to follow.Carradine's goofy eletric blue suit doesn't help anything either."
1,Very poor workout DVD,"This workout consists of doing a lot of quick, jerky moves, without real instructions about how to safely do them. You get hardly any instruction on how to properly place your body. Billy spends more time telling you to smile than how to properly perform his workout. Also, his sidekick/cheerleader doesn't demonstrate great control when she does the moves either. Also, this DVD is not divided into chapters so you can do just upper body, lower body, or ab work, or even skip past the intro. It is basically just a video put onto a DVD, and the sound quality is pretty poor. I do NOT recommend that anyone buy this workout DVD."
3,Cardio Circuit 1 is more intense,"This is a good intermediate workout. Since it is an hour, the pacing is less intense than cardio circuit 1. Good solid combinations, but I wouldn't say it took me to the ""next level."" Not intense enough for serious weight loss, but good for day to day weight maintenance."
5,Barbara Cooney never lets you down,"Island Boy was a book that my parents read to me when I was a child. I purchased it as a gift for family friends who have young children. The story is classic, touching on family dynamics, growing up, seeing the world but staying in touch with your roots. Even in a children's book you feel the attachment to the characters and the illustrations have always been a favorite of mine. I would recommend this book to anybody I know."
5,Lovely Story Invoking the Islands of Maine,"Island Boy tells the story of boy in Maine growing up on and around the ocean. The Island that he was raised on in his youth and its passing from generation to generation is the central theme.In terms that a child can understand, the book captures the transition of the island. The illustrations are lovely telling the story of making food, milking cows, and living on the ocean."
4,The Breast Man,"Although I enjoyed the whole book, ""Another Innocence"" was the story that really got me...and one I would choose as my favorite.I like Andy's style of writing even though I usually don't go in for the ""Dark Humour"". This book is definitely worth the read and, like me, you may not agree with all of the author's opinions but you will think about (and maybe even rethink) some of your own ideas about love, religion and Hell.Read it. And then reread it just to make sure you got everything!"
3,Could be better,"This book is a good start but if you want a detailed analysis of various paranormal scams you have to look else where, I wish there was more substance to this book , it started with a bang but fizzled toward the end, and UFO/alien treatment was tad bit too long."
3,Have Mental Stamina when listening to this,"Jeru embarks on his first solo LP without the Mighty Primo and he does better than expected producing his own songs. He hooks it up with mellow keys and hard BK basslines that call to mind Not Your Average from his second album. He intros Lady MC,Miz Marvel who even outflows the host on a couple of tunes. This is still East Coast hiphop with an ear for knowledgeable quotes like his other joints. The best of this bunch is Bi%c& with Di(_s(features Lil Dap of Group Home), 99.9%, and Seinfeld."
3,interesting,"It's an exciting topic and the source code on the CD is great. Incidentally, the book says you may use the code as you wish (provided you don't claim it as your own). Unfortunately, the writing is awkward. I found that I was able to get what the author was saying do running his many examples though a debugger. Without that I would have been lost. I am still glad I bought the book and will be applying what I have learned at work."
3,Beware the Parser Framework!,"I agree with the other 3-star reviews of this book. It's full of fascinating ideas about a very advanced topic, but the fact that everything is so dependent on the included framework makes it difficult to learn from. I think the best programming books teach you how to build step-by-step from the ground up. Instead, this book expects you to immerse yourself in the code first, and then figure things out from there."
2,Good case but near impossible to open!,"I have to admit this case looks good, fits well, and I like the idea of the kickstand to put your video iPod upright when you want to watch it. My biggest beef though is it is nearly impossible to open up the case once you snap it on. Seriously tough! I need a case where I can slide the iPod in and out easily because I like to dock mine in to an alarm clock at night. This will fit almost any size video iPod, but it's a real challenge to open it up easily once on. Be warned.Now if you never want to take it out... this is the case for you!"
1,Total Trash,"I need to use 20 words, so here it goes- don't buy this film, don't rent this film, don't watch this film, don't waste your money on this film, don't waste your mind on this film, don't think about this film, Just DON'T! Trust me. I only gave it one star to review it but it should be NEGATIVE 10 stars. Have a nice day."
3,As advertised,Arrived in a timely manner for Christmas. The cranking system does not provide a lot of juice. I cranked for several minutes but could not get the unit to power for more than a few seconds. Works fine with DC or AC power.
4,midland xt511 good but...............,i do like the radio but could be better if you could hook up a better antenna to it for more range my only problem with it is the range i live in the country that might be the problem i say if you live in a city it will be the best if you live in the country then no good over all i feel it is a great radio but needs to be more convertable
2,Kinda disappointed..,nice little radio but the reception is HORRIBLE. On the AM band I get 1 maybe 2 stations.. same with the FM. For the money that this thing retails at go with something with higher quality. I haven't used the GMRS function on this radio yet but judging by the lack of reception with the AM/FM radio I probably shouldn't bother.
2,Dead rechargeables,"I keep recharging the battery pack with house current, but they only seem to hold a charge for about 2 days. And, I am not able to replace them with my own rechargable batteries, only in the regular 4-AA slots. Otherwise, as long as I crank the handle, I get power. But it is not dependable"
1,Did not work,"The device was stuck on RX with only static. Could transmit as this would override the RX. It was much smaller than I thought. Also, the mic is pretty cheap. It wasn't that loud on weather channel."
1,Cheap Garbage,This radio is very cheap looks like a childs toy hence its small size. The biggest problem with it is that the radio only picks up one station and no way to go to another one without using the cheap plastic knob. Both knobs are pretty flimsy they might break with heavy use I was not going to try to find out so I am returning it. The Antennae is pretty bad small and short and lacks good reception. Now if they updated this radio and put in waterproof and made it more ragged plus made it possible to press bottoms to get to other stations faster with memory option that would really help. Also Get ride of the cheap antenna. This is no survivalist radio but a toy to play with. I warned you so do not be a fool and buy this c%$p.
4,Good show DVD,"We love Blackalicious, so didn't hesitate to buy this. The recording isn't super great, but it gives a great look inside a real gift of gab show. Recommend if you're a die hard."
2,A writer who can't convert to singer,"Jerry just does not have a voice that stands out, and the instrumentals lack energy. After hearing some of the songs that he wrote for others, I was surprised at how cliched the songs on his own album are. I liked ""If A Man Ain't Thinking 'Bout His Woman,"" though. At least he keeps his music country."
5,Great Christmas gift for anyone,Loved every minute of it. Music was fantastic. This would make a pefect gift for anyone. I look forward to more from this group.
2,works fine...at close range,"Got this to stream wireless audio from my computer to my patio. They work fine for small speakers, but only at close range and only if there are no walls in the way. As soon as I get out of the room, the signal drops out intermittently. Forget about going outside. The patio is less than 10 feet from the computer, but signal won't go through the wall reliably. I'd guess the 10 meter range quoted on the box is a little generous."
3,Speed Sleep II,"Speed II is the best one. Speed sleep 1 takes you thru the same ""power nap"" exercise that is on #II? #1 has some add on that should be on a cd alone."
4,TechGeek's Review,"This review is based on three years of use and 3000 pictures:*This camera is durable. The sliding cover and flip-up flash show now signs of wear*haven't worried about keeping the lens pristine*switched to rechargeable AA batteries early on and they still work. have to recharge them every 200 pics (get 158 exposures on the default setting on a 128MB card resulting in 700KB file sizes--enough for 8x10 pics!)*use the default Camedia picture software (got the upgrade) exclusively for picture printing and decent editing*software could use better 'templates' aside from 'happy bday'*plugging in the camera to the TV video inputs and running your own slide show is great for family get togethers (especially at the end of a trip before you leave is a nice recap of family events)*it's not a compact camera, but it's designed to hold well in your one hand to take pics*find myself adjusting the 'gamma' up a couple of notches before printing out the pics*night mode works great if you have a tripod"
1,Over exposure,"As an earlier reviewer had stated about problems with the camera we to are now experiencing the same problems. Pictures taken indoors in low light were fine. Anything with window light or light from a light fixture became streaky. Additionally, pictures taken outdoors in any kind of sunlight looked completely overexposed.We are now looking for a different make."
3,Good camera--BUT e-mail? Forget it,"One week into owning, and the camera is very good for daylight photos. I agree with everyone about the hopeless manual. Most images are too small to read without a magnifying glass. Biggest problem, and the telephone techs seem to have no answers, is trying to attach photos to e-mails. I have a new iMac, with OS 9.2, but none of the pdf. manual instructions work when trying to transfer to a folder.If e-mailing photos is your main interest, do research this problem before committing. (and DO buy rechageable batteries and a camera case)"
3,I like mark collie I need the black&white cd can you help?,"The cd is great. I'm looking for his other cd , title: born in black and white. Can you guys help in finding a copy? Used or new."
3,An Excellent Guide of Peter's Epistles,This is the first of Irving L. Jensen's books with which I have worked. I have been using the book for my personal study as preparation for leading an adult study group in I and II Peter. The book contains a good balance between teaching and thought provoking questions. The outlines are done very well and help provide a road map to the epistles. One drawback is that the lessons are much too large for one group meeting or personal study time slot.
1,Great Toys - Terrible Shipping,Once again the bottom dollar has taken a good thing and ruined it. For some reason Amazon/Toys R Us still hasn't gotten the message that a little shipping wisdom goes a long way. Ordered one and it came jammed in the box - bent. What's the use of creating an exclusive if your gonna waste it on shotty shipping practices.
1,Overpriced,This item is ridiculously overpriced. I've seen this figure elsewhere for less that $20. I would not pay no more than $12 for it.
4,I really wouldn't know,I really would not know how to rate this toy seeing that I have not had the chance to get one as they're all sold out. I agree with Darth Hooty.. some just hoard all the figures and sell them at outrageous prices on ebay. It's quite frustrating that some collectors are not able to purchase these figures.
5,"Unlikely, delightful resource","When I was in Oxford about 12 years ago, I was invited out to eat with 2 friends and another whom I had met briefly through them long before but otherwise did not know. She turned out to be a fascinating but undomineering conversationalist, and quite magnetic personality. When she asked me what I intended to do with my remaining day in England I said I hoped to track down a book but could not remember either the title or the author(s). When I described its contents she said, astoundingly, that she was the author and would give me a copy. (Our friends were neither Russianists nor academics of any kind, and had no idea I was interested in the area or the book, so it was a complete coincidence.) As to the book, it is a fascinating and original reference for any lover of Russian literature."
5,Surprisingly good workout!,"I took ballet for a couple of years as a child but now as an adult am struggling to find more active activities than sewing. I don't like aerobics or running because of the high impact nature of the sports, and I have trouble breathing while doing those. I was pleasingly surprised by this dvd (I've only done the first one so far), at how much of a workout is possible with simple, low impact movements. I was breathing harder after a few of the exercises and could feel my muscles working hard. It was also nice to have that connection with gracefulness, rather than just a sports workout. The music is enjoyable and it doesn't take too long to get the hang of the ballet moves. I highly recommend this dvd!"
2,Trendy avante guarde and offensive,"Visually, self-consciously artsy and pretentiously modernesque. This album should be called New York City Ballet Does Modern: This ""workout"" entails a gratuitous display of flesh and undulating muscle one associates with World Wide Wrestling and weight-lifting contexts; it is devoid of classical visual aesthetic and the tasteful protocol of the classical ballet studio."
3,Hmmm....this could be better!,"I found the workout hard to follow, wasn't sure where to start and I reckon the filming is way to dark. I felt as if I was working out in a miserable, dark room."
1,disappointment,"Don't bother with the set...workout one is difficult to follow, the cues are late or non-existent. Workout 2 is much better...a more comprehensive workout. I suggest buying just workout 2"
5,amazing benefits,"i did ballet growing up and continued til i was almost 18.. at the time my body was lean and my posture was great and i was flexible, fit & energetic.now i am almost 30 with a kid( you can imagine the difference), and after doing this dvd only once, i feel like there is hope for me and the rest of the world!this is a great low-impact workout that stretches and elongates each muscle in the body.i am really happy with it and i look forward to my second workout (dvd 2)one more thing, the narrator is amazing and the presentation is fantastic..."
2,Not an advanced workout,"I dance on a professional company and was looking for something to help keep me tone during breaks. This is not it. It's a very dumbed down workout, not for real dancers. Probably great for the average person whose danced a little"
2,Pass for me,"I really thought I'd like this book. It's a YA vampire story written in a fast and fun tone of voice. But in the end I found the heroine more annoying that enchanting. I'm told she's `innocent' (as in sweet and innocent) - a hockey player, drama club understudy who becomes incoherent when faced with the boy she likes. But her voice in my head is snotty and drowning in all the cliché elements of a teenage life. The voice just doesn't match the person and I end up disliking the heroine because of it.And the story itself of how she is bitten by a vampire by accident (should have been her twin sister) and becomes involved in a vampire world (rather unoriginal, I've seen almost everything in this world before) was just not all that interesting."
2,Bad Vampire Story,I decided to give this book a chance because I read some of the reviews on here and they said it was good. Well they were wrong! I've read so many vampire series and this book is horrible. At first I tried the first few chapters hoping it would get better and it only got worse especially when Lucifent turned out to be a child. Like what the heck is that?! The references to celebrities and just the language were horribe. I had to delete the thing right off my kindle. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of this author's books.
4,"Best of the ""Rose"" series","The ""Rose"" series of books are pretty well done and make a nice continuation of the Little House story (though in content and writing quality they don't quite come up to the level of the originals).This is the best of the lot for the scene of Laura at Pa's death. The tone, feeling, and writing were perfectly on target (though the POV should have been ""Laura"" at this point rather than ""Mama"" because Rose wasn't there for the scene). Nevertheless, a touchingly beautiful scene that recaptured the flavor of the original books."
3,"Good enough, but.............","Not great, not bad, am such a hopeless fan that I will buy virtually anything. Has some of the lesser knowns which is good. Still waiting for something special from the label...You know the material is there!!! Something ""live"" maybe?"
4,"Kudos for ""Wasted Moons""","In ""Wasted Moons,"" Nagele draws us in to the protagonist's quest to snap out of a mid-year funk. The reader becomes one with the main character and feels the emotional ups and downs of navigating through the unclear territory of being a single male in today's world. Under the neverending watch of the moon we journey on the quest for finding good humor, battling internal demons, and, of course, courting the opposite sex. We learn to trust fate as we follow the adventure with the uncertain ending, and find that good things can come to those who offer scotch to door-to-door religious crusaders."
4,I'm Happy!!!,"I've been wanting the song, Every Little Bit Hurts, for some time. I kept forgetting that Brenda Holloway sang the song. Now, I have her album with the song and many others, and I'm in ""hog heaven"". Thanks a bunch!!!"
3,Great songs and live tracks redeem this mediocre CD set,"I have have begun to expect mediocrity from Tori Amos. I am one of those ""old school"" Tori fans who thinks each album is slightly worse than the last. This album, the studio CD, is OK. I really love ""Concertina,"" ""Glory of the Eighties""(anyone else hear a resemblance to ""Talula"" there?), and ""Bliss."" ""1000 Oceans"" is quickly becoming one of my favorite Tori songs because it is so soulful and heartfelt. It's almost Gabriel-esque is scope. The rest kind of run together with the tom-fest on the drums and booming, sometimes skillful, basslines. Tori's vocals and piano just get lost. The live CD, however, is incredible. Reworked versions of ""Girl"" and ""Bells for Her"" are my favorites. Also, ""Cooling"" is a great tune, very similar feeling to ""Mother."" It is WORTH BUYING, if only for the four or so good studio tracks and the stellar live CD."
2,Where did the melodic piano playing Tori run off to??????,"Venus turns out to be the hollow planet. Prepare the warp drive to cruise past this one. The intensity of emotion you've come to expect from Ms. Amos (i.e. past albums such as the brilliant Little Earthquakes) is simply not there, so get it in your mind now that you're gonna be let down!! Someone injected this album with the current hip hop fever and it really takes away from what we all love about Tori, her acoustic and raw sound. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of recorded live albums, so I won't place my judgement on the supplemental CD."
3,Pretty good,"I am one of those people who instantly loved Little Earthquakes, and since then I've stood back in horror at Tori's incoherent, even laughable CDs. I bought TVAB because I read a lot of reviews which said it was the true follow-up to Little Earthquakes and was right back on track. As soon as I popped in the CD and heard, ""Father, killed my monkey. . ."" I had to roll my eyes and laugh. The first time I listened to it, it was just kind of an overemotional lump of blah, but it's grown on me. And I definitely like the live version, although sometimes she needs to calm down a bit. Overall, it's worth the money."
5,Incredible!,"All of Tori's albums have been consistently brilliant, and To Venus and Back is no exception. Disc 1 is as good as any, but it's the live disc that really gets your attention. Nobody, either band or solo artist, beats Tori Amos at live performances. Her concerts are uniquely involving and incredibly memorable. Fortunately disc 2 does her justice."
4,a new adventure with tori,"it took me two three agonizing months before i took hold of this album. When that time came i was ecstatic, and i was even more ecstatic when i've listened to it......but of course there are tunes that really do not vibrate well in my ears. to venus and back sounds like tori's recent album, yet its unique in a way that it offers new sound effects. In fact, i find the album to be somewhat like a collection of techno-dance tunes, especially the memorable glories of the 80's. tori's devoted fans won't be disappointed coz the album still offers the classic tori in the song 1000 oceans. Its a collector's item."
5,"Still Tori, but magically different","I'm loving these two CDs. Not only is there a fabulous new CD with shiny new songs, but also a live CD with some of the best versions of Tori's songs that I've ever heard. I'm delighted that she put Purple People on it (one of my all time favorite Tori songs). The news songs are a bit different then what I was expecting, but the fact that they defy my expectations make them even better and more unique."
5,Another great album from Tori Amos,"All of Tori's albums are special in their own way. And I agree with the notion that a musician must try different outlets to grow as an artist; in Tori's case: a backing band. The songs on ""To Venus And Back"" may not be among her most intimate, but they are her catchiest tunes ever."
4,"Awesome, but go back to the piano!!!","This cd is quite an evolution for Tori, but i do wish she would go back behind the piano. It would have been 2 stars, but the live disc is so amazing. ""Lust"" is an all time keeper, but some of the other songs really sound the same. Please Tori, make my heart break like you did in Under the Pink, the most beautiful album ever recorded."
1,Painful,"I really hate to say this because I have been a Tori fan from the start, but I believe she's beginning to believe her own ""larger than life"" hype. The music (if you can call it that) on this album runs together into one monotonous glob and the lyrics are completely unintelligible. I don't want to compare TVAB with Tori's previous albums because I believe that it is important for artists to grow in their craft. I just don't understand where Amos is growing and I don't want to play anymore!"
4,It took a while... but....,"I have decided i LOVE this album. It took a bit of time for me to adjust to her new band style with choirgirl and so i wasnt sure what to expect with this album but as usual, i end of loving it... Its TORI! you have to love her is all i can say : )"
1,WARNING -- Bogus Listing!!! Do NOT order from DVD LEGACY,"Just like the last person who placed a review here, I ordered the import version of ""To Venus and Back"" from DVD Legacy and received the domestic version. This listing is NOT what it claims to be. WARNING -- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!"
1,Good CD bad seller!,"I experienced the same problem as the others. I ordered the import version of ""To Venus and Back"" from DVD Legacy and received the domestic version. They have a description that is completely false. Don't get ripped off like I did. I bought TWO of these accidentally, thinking they were the special import versions, but unfortunately I was wrong and did not get refunded."
5,Brilliant,"This artist never ceases to amaze me with her completely astounding talent, creativity and good taste. This 2 CD pack is worth owning for anyone who appreciates real music. Thank you Tori."
5,Review of Curtis Morrow's Return of the African-American,It is wonderful to get an inside view of Africa from one who was so brave to leave the comforts of America and spend many years there. The information contained in the book shows a side of Africa unknown to the average American. I have learned from this author and believe that others will also.
2,Spend the extra bucks,"This product makes ice, but does not store it. So at any given time, you have a small basket filled with melting, almost clear ice. I returned mine after it broke in the first 24 hours."
5,Excellent Reference Book!!!,"I highly recommend JoAnn Moody's book for all people involved in higher education faculty, staff and student recruitment. She has succintly identified all of the good and bad actions and thoughts of those who desire to recruit with a goal of increased diversity. Moody has provided concrete and explicit advice that will enable hiring officials to effectively recruit and increase the diversity of their institution's employees. Buy this book for all of your search committees!"
1,Not impressed.,I was expecting this book to have all the answers - it doesn't. I found the book incomplete and amateur in its findings.
3,not bad,"I read this book as part of a group Bible study. While there were definitely some good points, there were also a number of places where I think the author missed the mark or misapplied Scripture. I felt like I spent more time defending my beliefs than gleaning from the author. But the general premise was fine and there were definitely things to be learned."
1,SEXY Mobile ???? I dont think so,"Nokia released 3 (ONLY 3, the 7610 is NOT a part of the group) Art deco mobiles which are all about looks.7260: The Smallest and cheapest7270: The Mediam clamshell7280: The Expensive masterpieceSince these phones are only made for looks, I give the 7270 one star. I had the phone for a month, very ugly and looks very cheap, also it has the worst assembly which makes look more of a cheap imitation toy rather than a $500 mobile.As for the functionality, the phone works great, great display, great features, no bluetooth though.So if you seek envy, crank up your wallet and get the 7280, if you seek envy and functionality, crank up your wallet ALOT and get the $1000 Nokia 8800. But If u seek supremety, get ready to max out a lot of plastic for the $40,000 Nokia Vertu Signature series."
3,"good, but not essential","i first bought steppenwolf live as a teenager and remember being disappointed with it. After reading the reviews already posted here, i decided, all these many years later, to give it another shot. I still am disappointed. The music is good, loose, sloppy rock and roll, and 'Monster' is a great cut. I have a hard time believing 'Twisted' was recorded 'live'...maybe it was a rehearsal jam or leftover studio track as the applause leading into it sure sounds 'canned', as does some of the other audience parts. The editing/mixing sounds done on the cheap and having seen steppenwolf live believe this could have been much much better."
4,Great fan,"This is a heavy duty fan and honestly a little bigger than we expected. It definitely does its job, almost too well! I gave it 4 stars because I wish there was one level lower than its lowest level. Other than that, this is a great fan and I love having the remote."
3,cool down,"Very disappointed. Bought this because it said it was very quiet. WRONG. It could not be any louder. Blows the air very nicely and was easy to assemble. Seems to be very sturdy. If you want quiet so you can hear your television, don't buy this. If you like loud, then this is for you."
4,Worth its price!!,Very easy to assemble. Breezy..with multi-speed option. The remote is definitely the plus point what you don't get in Wal-mart models at this bargain price. Not too loud. Worth its price!
5,Takes fantastic pics,Couldn't ask for a better camera. Very easy to use. The picture quality is really fantastic. The photos come out looking very professional. I would recommend this camera to anyone.
4,Take the time to learn,"This is a good camera, but if you really want to get the most out of it, take the time to learn how to use its features. Once you do, you'll get great pictures.The zoom is the selling point, and one should keep that in mind if they plan on buying this cameria. The zoom will allow you to capture items other off the shelf cameras won't. Take advantage of this feature!"
2,This is not a camera for beginners,"This is my first digital camera and I did a lot of research before buying it. I bought it mainly for the 8x optical zoom and because of a retailer who recommended Olympus' lenses. The flaws of this camera were said by other reviewers - things like slow focus and blurry pictures. You CAN take good pictures with this camera, but it just takes a LONG time to learn for beginners (and after a lot of mistakes). And if you need somebody else to take pictures for you, it will be plenty of headaches. The paper manual that comes with the camera is the most user-UNfriendly manual I've ever seen - it assumes the user knows a lot about cameras. In conclusion, this camera is NOT for anyone who wants ease of use."
5,AMAZING,"THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!!!AND EVERYSONG IS JUST THAT. ALL THE TRACKS HIT YOU LIKE A TON OF BRICKS BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WARM YOUR HEART WITH THE AMAZING VOCALS, AND HEARTFELT LYRICS. ITS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO PICK A FAVORITE BECAUSE EACH SONG IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE LAST. ANY FAN OF PUNK MUST OWN THIS TODAY. GREAT MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE AS LONG AS BANDS LIKE STRIKE ANYWHERE ARE AROUND"
2,Handy?,"I love the catalog rack, this was called an extension to the rack. There is no place to add this set of panels to the rack."
2,Requiem for a Dream,"This book is extremely boring. If I start a book, I always finish it but this is one that I only read about 5 pages before I put it down and do something else. Hopefully it will get better as I get further into the book. I've read about half of it so far."
5,Whoah!,"A great piece of work! Better than Last exit... Selby's prose can seem daunting in the beginning, but his story telling is so rich that those three page paragraphs with no qoutation eventually you get used to. What a graphic and total picture of addiction and lonliness, truely a classic."
5,A Classic,"Hubert Selby Jr. is an artist. However, instead of using brushes and paint, he uses words. This is one of the most amazing books that I've ever read, even as depressing as it is.First of all, this book is not for the faint of heart. I decided to read it when I read the back cover and saw what an interesting and heart-breaking story it was. I liked it very much because of all the attention Selby Jr. pays to detail and the slang that he commonly uses in this book. My only disappointment is that there are no quotation marks in this book, making it a little bit difficult to understand at times.I may only be a 10th grader, but I know that this book will appeal to people much older than myself. So if you get this book, prepare to be amazed."
3,"Very dark, But compelling.","This was a good book, it took a while to get into it. The writing is something you have to get used to. The sentences al run together, I believe the author was trying to really make you feel the story. I am glad I read it, it was very dark, and depressing, but you really did feel like you were watching the characters spiral downward. Heavy!!! But an interesting read."
2,CCwing75,Could not follow this book. Was mis lead by the other reviews. I did not even finish it. Would not recommend.
2,Slow start,"The story itself is not a bad one, but the simple dialogue and overly done ""thug"" scene seems to take away a little of what would have made the story GOOD. I just wish there had been a little more thought provoking throughout the story."
4,"Disappointing First, delightful Academic Festival.","Editing my previous review, where I had only listened to the First Symphony. I thought the symphony was a pedestrian performance, and I still do. However, I've now listened to the overtures and they are terrific. Never heard a more delightful performance of the Academic Festival. Light texture, springy rhythms - she really gets the high spirits. Tragic Overture also very effective and emotionally intense. I hope she records another First Symphony."
