3,Okay for what it is ... [updated],"In the review I just posted, I suggested looking for books by ""Richard M. Peck,"" but just did a search of Amazon and found the gentleman's name is ""Richard Peck,"" no M. -- sorry for any confusion!"
4,car needs new front tires,great dizine but the front tires are eazy to bend and break. Devon got 3 months out of it before the car broke and we had to get rid of it
4,"Fun, fun, fun 'til the soldiers make the bugs go away. . .","A delightful shoot-em-up story, with a pleasantly conservative political perspective and just the right amount of pro-Israel asides for my taste. I'm tempted to give five stars, which perhaps the book deserves if taken strictly on its own terms. I can't quite bring myself to give the top rating because of (a) the lack of any real characters, (b) a single, throwaway sex scene that's surprisingly tepid, (c) perhaps a little too much emphasis on the various types and calibers of weaponry used by the human soldiers and militia, and (d) several direct references to other science fiction stories, which I find a bit heavy handed. Please take these minor criticisms as an indication of how good the rest of the storytelling is, because I enjoyed the book very much and remain tempted to add the fifth star."
2,"Not up to snuff, John","In the first four Posleen books and the Empire of Man series, Ringo made his characters amusing, human (even when they weren't) and made readers *care* about what happened to them. Sad to say, ""Into The Looking Glass"" while full of action and imagination, just didn't make me really care if any of the characters survived.Too much got glossed over, there were too many loose ends and Ringo's usual deft sketches of people descended into careless stereotype all too often.Just not up to past efforts."
2,Too unbelievable to enjoy,"If you've read the other reviews of this book you know that a furry little critter named Tuffy appears out of nowhere to save a little girl, and they become best buds.The girl becomes somewhat of a celebrity because of the E.T. she carries around.This happens fairly early in the book and unfortunately it's where I lost my ""suspension of disbelief,"" though I finished the book.The fact that this is the first exposure man has had to any extraterrestrial life, not to mention INTELLIGENT life, should be an awe-inspiring experience.World leaders would want to meet with Tuffy. Scientists would want to study Tuffy.But no, none of that in this book. Tuffy and the little girl just go about their business as if it happens every day.This is just one example of how Ringo's depiction of first contact with an alien species just doesn't seem believable enough to inspire anything except apathy, and it really takes away any enjoyment I may have gotten from the story."
1,"No customer service, period","One month ago I would have given this machine 5 stars; it really was a nice player, and even having been owned by two previous owners, worked without any glitches, was easy to hook up, and met our generally basic needs. I have to admit, I never tried the ""copy"" function, but only used it for playback of factory DVDs and VHS tapes. However, several weeks ago, without any explanation or changes on the user's end, the VCR just stopped working; oddly, there was sound, loud and clear, but no image. This happened with all the tapes we tried (which worked just fine in another VCR) and we even tried cleaning the heads, changing out the RCA cables, etc. to no avail. When I contacted GoVideo via their website, their response was plain and simple:""GoVideo does not provide technical support or customer service for over a year now""What a company!"
5,I love it,"I have had absolutely no problems with this unit; it operates smoothly and quietly. I can play all of my MP3 and music CDs with the DVD player. The volume control problem is easily remedied by turning up the volume on the tv. I needed a new VCR and bought this instead, for basically the same price. Everything works great."
1,Disgusted from Utah,"... Now, hardly a month after owning it, the VCR doesn't tape properly and we have only used it a handful of times. Now I am going to have to eat the cost of shipping it somewhere to get it repaired for it to probably break down soon thereafter. Would not buy any more electronics from the internet. Will only buy from somewhere that has a decent return policy (more than 30 days) and somewhere within driving distance. Please don't buy this if you are thinking about. You will be sorry."
1,noisy VCR!,"We bought the 4400 at Costco. The DVD worked great, no sound problems. The VCR motor makes a horrible, loud buzzing sound. We're returning the unit today."
2,Poorly designed and manufactured,"Not only do you have to give them more money to fill the the cheaply made worm viewer, they still don't provide you with everything you need to fill it up. Turns out I need 4"" of shredded newspaper ""firmly pressed into the bottom of the unit"". Great, after waiting weeks for the worms and filler, now I have to shred a lot of newspaper. An instruction booklet didn't come with the worms, but the manuf did respond quickly to my email. Overall, this is expenesive for what you get, certainly not designed or made well. It's been a big disappointment. (The ladybugs and butterfly kits are much better--and from different manufacturers.)"
3,Not the greatest quality,"Overall it is what it's advertised to be, a white oak bokken. It had a crack about 3-4 inches long just above where the rubber tsuba attaches going with the grain. Also there was a dent on one side near the tip. Looks like it was dropped before shipping or something. I'm not using this to train in a dojo, just to get some extra practice in at home otherwise I'd have sent it back for an exchange/refund. Also it came in a box about the size of a 52 inch plasma TV, seems kind of wasteful. Maybe they just ran out of normal boxes and wanted to ship it ASAP? Not really a complaint just comment. Overall for the price I'm ok with it, if I was using this to practice in a dojo I'd be upset with the quality, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't last long with the crack in it. I've broken a white oak jo before, but never a bokken so I'm not sure."
5,White Oak Bokken is worth it.,"I really like my White Oak Bokken. It seems to be heavier and a little thicker than my brother's other wooden Bokken. I don't test its strength for sword fighting oftenl, but it seems to hold up well. I also like the looks of the white oak compared to the black paint of other swords. I am definitly happy with my choice."
4,bokken,i think its a pretty good bokken i give it a four only because the handgaurd didnt fit that well but you dont really need that
1,"If you need a legitimate weapon, don't waist your money.","If you need a legitimate weapon, don't waste your money.I ordered three of these because I have new students who would not require a first rate bokken to get started. I thought I would gamble on these for the price.I would not accept these if they were given to me. I don't think I could trade them for a box of bent nails.They are Taiwan made. 2 out of the 3 are so warped as to be useless. They are nearly rough hewn with a coat of gloss varnish.Shipping nearly equaled the cost of this kindling wood. PLEASE do not waste your money on these."
5,Every writer should own this,"This book is just what the doctor ordered. It focused on setting, point of view, how to structure a scene, etc. I loved how the author gave examples from books and movies to illustrate various aspects of writing. This is a good book for novice writers and those writers who are looking to improve their writing skills."
1,Does not work with CFL bulbs,"Nowhere in the description does it say this product is incompatible with CFL, but it's front and center on the package. It is therefore mostly useless to me. I would have liked to have known that before I purchased it. So, thanks for nothing."
5,"Great product, works well!","I've been having ongoing Tick issues with 2 small dogs. I've tried the flea and tick drops on the skin, yet to little success.I used this product, and you can see the ticks fall off thereafter!Ensure you read the instructions, keep out of your pet's eyes, and leave on for 5 minutes.I plan on repeat in a few days."
2,Bit of a slip up purchasing this one,"Just not my cup of tea. If you are into futuristic stories then go for it, otherwise look further afield."
5,great overview of 70's music,"all of the selections are great, even maggie may and i'm not a rod stewart fan. the extended version of ""free bird"" on this cassette is not to be believed. it's not the extended ""live version"" which i have on cd and which cannot compare to the version on this cassette. i wish someone could tell me on what cd of lynryd skynyrd this extended version appears. i imagine the cd of this compilation is worthwhile since it includes the great steppenwolf. to get this much geat music in a cassette at this price is wonderful."
1,Terrible,"Puzzles made by Warren Industries are poorly made from the ""pattern and piece shape"" standpoint. I bought the ""Nuggetville"" puzzle (Ted Blaylock, wooden) and I had to actually flip it over and follow the wood grain pattern to get the proper placement of the puzzle pieces, and even then, the last two pieces, I had to force into place. Finish was top quality, but the shapes of the pieces were only limited to two types, it was very difficult to build, as many pieces ""seemed"" to fit into place. Very Frustrating..........."
2,Inaccurate,"Scale is nearly impossible to zero-balance. I set it up next to an RCBS sliding scale and another digital one - the RCBS and digital agreed, the Lee did not...I am not confident in it's accuracy in the least. Don't be cheap when buying a scale, the powder charge is the single most important part of reloading."
2,Works but.........,"I ordered my Lee Powder Scale based on a 5 star review. How could I go wrong with this product, It got 5 stars. Well, I certainly don't disagree that it is an accurate scale, however, it is not very easy to set up and it takes alot of patience. You can tell that it's a lower end scale and has room for error. Think I am going to return it."
2,Wait for better......,"This product simplifies some of your A/V issues (fewer cables to hook up and one less item to stack in the entertainment center), but wait for a better version to come out from a company that knows what they're doing.Problems:DVD playback has digital 'glitches' - blackspots and blurs, jumps in dialog.DVD/CD play has background flutter noise - the discs don't spin noiselessly....not great during quiet movies.CD playback doesn't have much functionality. Play/stop, that's it. No random, continuous play, or other functions you'd expect from a CD player.$ is cheap, but wait until a better-known company launches a product..."
2,Supplement Only,"There are many practice exams in this book, scattered among other filler material, but only a few will really prepare you for the real thing. This would be a good supplement to better test preps such as the GRE/MCAT or other Civil Service Exam math prep books. Some of the materials are completely irrelevant to the FBI and appear to just be a compilation of other occupational exams that were photocopied and bound in some guys basement in the mid 80's. I was successful in the real exam but would only use portions of this book as a part of one's study routine."
5,The real deal,Roberts is both a true seeker and a masterful writer. You owe it to yourself to check this one out.
4,Even better on the second reading,"I have just finished reading this book for the second time and I enjoyed it even more.This work provides an insightful look into a very complex part of the world and manages to convey the spiritual and physical journeys of the author in an interesting manner. I feel the book provides enough historical and religous background information to enhance the reader's understanding without being excessive or dull.This is not quite a pure travel book and not quite a pure spiritual book, but I think readers of each type will find enough to enjoy here."
5,remember?,I remember these book from when I was small. Sometimes they are a bit dated but still really charming. My son loves them.
4,DVS!,"this is a very good skate video. The DVS team has solid footage with weird animations. Unfortunately I could have enjoyed Getz's part more, as I like his skating, maybe it was the music. Mikey's part was okay. Wilson's and Roger's part was good. Dill's part was good and interesting. Zered and Dennis shared a great part. Torey and Daniel C. shared a cool part. Berra had a nice, solid part after coming off ankle surgery. Daewon definetly had the best part filled with diversity of skating. He skates and does everything in his part. Definetly worth watching."
4,Great timesaver workout,I really like this TaeBo workout - you get a great workout in a short amount time. The reason I gave it 4-stars is because as other people mentioned - the counting is off. You do not get the same repetitions on each side. I wind up finishing it up on my own to balance it out.Otherwise I actually like this one over the Cardio Circuit II.
5,:),"I've only had this foot for a month and a half, and I've already used it on several projects. It's easy to use once you get your stitch length and tension set the way you like it. And it gathers uniformly. My only complaint is that the foot didn't come with any paperwork what so ever... no instructions, tip, tricks, nothing. I tried to find a tutorial online to get it all figured out with no luck, and ended up just messing with it for a few hours before I figured out what worked well. Also, make note that the tension and stich length is different for different types of fabrics, so you have to play around with it each time you want to use a different fabric. All in all, I'm glad I purchased it :)"
2,Does not work after anodizing,"I used this to mark bare aluminum and it seemed to work fine but it wasn't as deep as I would have liked and I was using it in the deep etch mode. After anodizing it is basically invisible unless the light hits it just right. Doesn't work well on aluminum after anodizing, probably works well for other things but not this."
5,Yummy!,"It's a perfect single serving, and goes great with about a quarter cup of rice. It's spicy, but not overly so. Very good."
3,tasty but too much fat,"It s delicious but too much fat not my favorite meal.It s not really healthy for our hearts , i guess ?...any cute female doctor on amazon.com and looking for buying grocery on amazon please tell me this. Thanks alot."
1,"Me mandaron otro modelo de Reloj y además mas barato que el que yo había pagado, lo devolví.","Me mandaron otro modelo de Reloj y además mas barato que el que yo había pagado, lo devolví."
3,chrome stacking shoe rack,The picture of this product is misleading as it appears to be a rack of 4 levels. The product is only 2 levels. The picture should state that 2 racks have been stacked. I found the same product at a local store for less.
1,The advertising picture is misleading,The picture showing a 4 tier rack is not what you get - this is 2 racks stacked together - i ordered 4 thinking that this would hold over 80 pairs of shoes - when in fact the 4 that arrived only hold just over 40. Be careful not to be fooled the same way - i thought i was getting a bargain - but turned out to be an expensive mistake.
3,mediocre verlaine,"The guitar licks by Verlaine are notably what most people find compelling in Verlaine, yet his voice sounds a lot different in this cd than marquee moon and adventure. Not worth the money if you just liked marquee moon, but if you're a die hard fan than get it, i guess."
3,Had mine for a long time,"I have had this player for several years. It has worked fine until now. And the only problem is, the lens needs cleaning. I give it three stars because it's not spectacular or super, it's just average and does what I expect it to."
1,Reconsider before you buy,*WARNING* DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD PLAYER....or be prepared to purchase a new one every two years.
2,Too much talking!,"Let me start off by saying that this workout is refreshing since it aims to combine martial arts and yoga. There is an instructional section on the DVD that breaks down every move and allows you to learn proper form and do the moves several times. Then why does the instructor do this again during the actual workout for every move?! V. frustrating to try to keep your heart rate up as he re-explains foot and arm positioning for every movement.The express segment is the best part of the tape since there is very little talking. Also, I thought it would be more of a fusion of yoga and martial arts but the DVD is split into a martial arts and yoga section with no cool down or stretch--(each workout ends with meditation."
3,Spoilers upon spoilers,"Though I cannot detract from the winning research put into this great reference, the few times I've stumbled into thumbing through it, a major spoiler is dropped in my lap with nary a warning. (I am still working through H.M.S. Surprise vol.3) The first page I opened on displays a period carriage similar to the one a certain (here un-named) character's wife is killed in. ""Fantastic"" I say to myself, there goes that surprise. A two-in-one blow! Vowing to steer towards the leeward of this volume until I've read every last Aubrey-Maturin novel, I come across a review of said work in an above listed review. There I assume a fellow reader, familiar to the subtlety of plot sequence and the necessity of well-timed disclosures won't repeat this mistake. Haha! Now I've pre-maturely learned that a major charactor's parent is a Spanish Spy! I'm sure I'll enjoy this work sometime in the distant future, but it will ruin your experience if you read through it too early."
4,A short overview of the sailing Royal Navy,"If you have read every sailing naval action book already, there isn't a lot here new. But, if not, this is a good book to have either as a reference or a coffee-table piece- it can do either, and the illustrations are certainly good."
4,Solid Win,I reccomend this game as a 2nd purchase. (Mario is a 1st for us all.) Its great music groundbreaking graphics and the ea games seal put together as 1 is a great game. BUT IT HAS A HUGE PROBLAMO! Its maps..... You can be flying in to a turn and POP it will fly up in front of you and youll spin out. And the maps are amall so its had to see chicanes. 4 1/2 of 5.Im Hooked.
3,OK Price OK Item,"As the previous reviewer said, this is definitely a spare set of pillows. We are currently using these pillows in our shams for one of our guest bedrooms. It would be helpful for many if the thread count was published. We looked all over for it but could not find it on here or elsewhere on the Internet. That may help others make a better, purchase decision. Other than that, if you are looking for spares these are good."

1,"IT SUCKS, DON'T BUY IT AND WRITE DREAMWORKS ABOUT IT...","to quote another review ""the subtitle production for the film is atrocious... the only subtitles offered are subtitles for the hearing impaired.""it distracts from the movie so bad that it isn't worth watching!and even the hearing impaired subs are awful, they sub a song sung in english and dont sub any of the Japinese songs...when i hear a gun fire and i read a sub {gun noise} it distract from the movie...the movie seemed to be great and i wish it had been done the the care and technical expertise of the first Ghost in the Shell...IT SUCKS, DON'T BUY IT AND WRITE DREAMWORKS ABOUT IT..."
1,I CAN HEAR THE SOUNDS!,Excellent animation. Beautiful animation. Animation worth living for. I cannot stress enough how beautiful the scenes are. However... the fact that the subtitles are so big almost completely destroys the animation. add to that the fact that they tell you every little noise is a complete downfall that completely detracts from the massive home theatre system I have built. On a 9 foot wide screen that's almost a foot tall for the text. Furthermore Myself and many other people i know would have been more than happy to buy this AFTER it had an english track and/or had a proper subtitling track.I only hope some Japaneese producers get ahold of this DVD and realize dreamworks is a company that puts nothing into their efforts. (and they missed subtitling quite a few sound effects)
1,Cheap release for a GREAT MOVIE,"All in this movie is great, the animation, the music and the storyline. But Dreamworks do a really cheap job on their anime release, NO ENGLISH SOUNDTRACK, only japaness language and some subtitle language. I just recommend that YOU DON'T BUY this and wait for a better release."
3,Meh... The subtitles bugged me,"Apparently Go Fish Studios isn't so good when it comes to subtitles. They decided to cram the hearing-impaired Japanese-English subtitles and the standard Japanese-English subtitles together. The movie was pretty good, but I kept getting distracted by the fact that it was putting up subtitles telling there was a chopper flying by, birds cawing, etc. I questioned their funding for this project. The film itself, though, was good, in my opinion."
5,"excellent movie, lousy DVD","Ghost in the shell 2 is an excelent follow up of the first movie (ghost in the shell). Keeping the same characters and adding a new twist keeps you glued to the the tv. The animation is very clean and sometimes realistic. The only draw back and unfortunately ruins the veiwnig pleasure is the hearingimpared subtitles. I always watch my anime in subtitles and usualy have no problem reading it and following the movie, but this was annoying. I give the movie 5 stars and the dvd format -5 stars.Do not let the format stop you from buying it however, becouse the movie makes up for the the lousy format."
3,DVD only captioned for hearing impaired,"I saw this film at a theater when it came out, it was subtitled, but not captioned for the hearing impaired. It is a wonderful film, but NOT in this DVD release. I could only watch 10 minutes of it because every sound is labeled on the screen. It is very annoying and distracting. I wish I had read the customer reviews before I bought it!P.S. I mailed the disc back to the company and was sent a disc with English subtitles. Now I'm happy! This is a very artistic film, a philosophical meditation on the question, ""What does it mean to be a human being?"""
1,"The 1 is for the DVD, not the movie!","I agree with everything stated here about the cheap-ish way in which they slapped this DVD together. What is a truly memorable and fascanating film, was relabeled, boxed (art work - awful), and sold to unsuspecting people. Anyone who saw the first movie wasted no time buying the second movie.Honestly, we should get our money back, and the DVD should be free. Riiiiiggghhhhht! Sure, bud! We'll get right on that . . . sucker.In closing,""did you remember to submit your TPS reports?"" :)"
1,Total Crap.,"Why I gave this movie a chance after the original's complete and utter failure, I have no idea. It's filled with computer-animated graphics; way to start off on the wrong foot there. CG is total garbage. You can't relate with the main character, because he is devoid of personality. The plot is random at best; and everyone is chock-full of 'wise-old-man' sayings. If that isn't enough to make you vomit, the soundtrack (copied straight from the original) will. If your lucky you'll fall asleep like I did and wake up when the torment, er...movie, is over."
3,Disc replacement program available!,"I saw this amazing film on DVD and marveled at both the amazing visuals and truly annoying subtitle track. However, it looks like this was an accident:http://www.twitchfilm.net/archives/001010.htmlDreamworks is offering a replacement program for everyone with a disc that has the English SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf & Hard of Hearing) track instead of a normal one.Now, if only, they'd replace the insert with professionally-done case graphics... Seriously, I'm a professional designer (the kind schooled in the Swiss Grid, etc.), and this looks like it was done by a teenager in Photoshop for $20. It's amazing that a huge company like Dreamworks could devote so little money to this release."
2,If you want the real deal go region 2,"I'm amazed that the US still has to put up with this half baked rush release, If you want the fully realised package with English sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version ISBN B000BY9ALU. OK so it'll probably cost you twice as much and you'll need a multi region player. But for something this good why put up with second best.This is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on, as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused. It continues the theme from GITS 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking. At times it gets a touch pretentious with Batou and Togusa swapping obscure quotations, but it is both beautiful and thought provoking.Again a split review 5 for the film, 2 for the slipshod DVD release."
2,English please,"The very fact that the movie was only in Japanese language discouraged me from going any further than the first word in the movie. The movie also subtitles varies noises in the movie such as a helicopter approaching and background chatter of common civilians. I'll give this movie two stars just for the fact that I can't stand to watch movies that can only be viewed with subtitles and no English language, as well as the subtitling of various background noises."
2,Major Problem with DVD!!!!,I didn't see the movie but I was waiting for the dvd.To my horror the subtitles destroy the film and there are no englishvoices over the japan version.The artwork is great but this film is very hard to enjoy and I feel I really wasted my money.I hope Dreamworks does recall this film.These films take a very long time to make at least give the animation fans their money'sworth.
5,It's Legit,"This is a re-release of the Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence. If you've seen the originally released DVD, you know that it wasn't available with an English soundtrack- it was Japanese only with English subtitles. I'll buy the re-released with the hope that the English dub does justice to the dialogue, which tends to wax philosophical. In the event the English doesn't do the trick, it can still be watched in Japanese with English subtitles. If you haven't seen this amazing film I strongly suggest you do-- it's visually !STUNNING! The storyline is complex, yet compelling."
4,Sci fi poetry,"Combining elements reminescent of Bladerunner,Matrix,Terminator and I Robot this is a surrealist tour de force and is as visually stunning as it is thought provoking. Imagine Mulder OD'd on smart drugs and Allan Watts and you have some of the obscurest and most intellectually satisfying lines I've ever heard in one film. The questions this movie raises places it light years beyound most mainstream movies of its genre. It is a heavily atomospheric movie, with a great eye for incidental detail and subtle visual effects. This movie is not a kids film, it raises the bar way above most anything in its class. While the characters do stand around and espouse quite a bit, there's enough going on in the film to keep it interesting. It's close to being a masterpiece of animation; I'd give it an 8-9 out of 10."
2,This movie is in Japanese NOT English,"The info that Amazon lists is incorrect. There are English subtitles but the dialogue is only in Japanese. I agree with the first review - I hate subtitles. If I wanted to read something, I'd be reading the manga. You will miss half of the scenes because you'll be trying to read the subtitles (and there are a lot of philosophical discussions in this movie so plan to read a lot).This is a good movie but if you actually want to watch it, instead of occasionaly glancing at the screen when you aren't reading, then wait for the dubbed version which will probably be released sometime in the future. And most dubbed videos offer the option of subtitles. All in all I have no idea why the put this out without dubbing AND subtitles. I presume to make more money with a dubbed only edition in the future."
1,Zooma,The Guitar work is amazing. However in my opinion the music is very weird. This is coming from someone who likes music from almost all the old psychedelic bands from the 60's. If you want something different this cd is for you.
1,Kind of a repetitive and boring release,"I agree with one of your reviewers that gave this a one star rating also. This is just boring, repetitive, techno-pop crap! Mr.Jones is definitely a great bass player and musician, but this stuff just doesn't work. I think that if he can't do any better than this, he should stick to producing other artists or something else in the music business. I really think that if he tried, he could make better music than is offered here. The sound quality wasn't anything to write home about either. It didn't have that treble bite that I like to hear in rock music. What it comes down to, is there's no rooma for zooma in this rock fans life."
3,"so, so",the quality isn't there for the money. it's so flexble it shifts on the head too easily. i would prefer an elastic back instead of the velcro
1,"Feels good, works poorly","even on a $15 mousing surface, the mouse doesn't track well. the pointer jumps all over the place and doesn't move smoothly at all. No accuracy... It is hard to click an ok button, I couldn't even imagine trying to play a game with it. Also, the slider feet pick up crap from who knows where and have to be cleaned several times a week. I was just trying to get a cheap mouse for a work computer, next time I will just pay more and get a good mouse from logitech.Update 19 Feb 2012: the side button stopped working completely."
5,Good product,"Looking for a simple, comfortable mouse, this is it. Little larger-comfortable, plug in-no batteries and good response.usb plug, but even came with the old school plug adapter ps2 I think they were called?"
4,Not a bad mouse,"For this mouse this price could not get any better, I've only had this product for a day but I've noticed that it truly is comfortable and it comes with some interesting attributes.Pros:ComfortableNot noisy clickingCan use almost any surfaceCon:The scroll wheel in this mouse is a little bit 'rough' to move. Overall the 4-way movement feature is nice but it makes it so it requires a little bit 'more' effort when moving up and down with the wheel to scroll through pages. Overall it is not to bad though, just a little 'harder to move' than almost any other mouse I've ever used."
4,Casual Mouse for Casual People,"I recently purchased this product for a friend who I had lent one of my expensive gaming mouses to originally.Considering I had the very same mouse for over three years, it works good as a spare or for basic operation of the Windows interface.Pros: Comfortable, Windows automatically installs the drivers, cheap.Cons: The wheel is horrible if your an avid scroller, however the casual user tends not to mind."
1,Terrible wheel/middle click,"Like many people I tend to use the middle button quite a lot to open new tabs in my web browser. If you are one of these people, look elsewhere, because the Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 is awful.It takes quite a bit of effort to actually depress the mousewheel, and when you do, it doesn't always register as a mouseclick (despite a fairly audible sound when you do so). I don't know if it's a driver issue or a hardware issue but it sporadically happens with every Comfort Optical 3000 on every PC in our company. Other Microsoft mice on the same PCs using the same drivers work fine."
3,"Descent, but should have better tracking ability for a midrange mouse","This mouse is comfortable with responsive left and right buttons, which flow with the rest of the mouse. It glides across many surfaces very well. However, it is VERY picky about its surface. If the surface is not perfectly smooth, or just the material the mouse wants, it will either get very jumpy, or seem to work, but ""stick"" on occassion. The extra DPI is nice in theory, allowing you to turn the sensativity down on your computer for better accuracy in theory. However, the tracking ability of this mouse on most surfaces kills it's DPI advantage. I am still using it right now, but I am strongly considering switching to one of the Logitech Premium Opticals I just bought."
5,I love my mouse...,"I've had this mouse for years and it's the first one (and only one so far) that has felt comfortable in my hand. I have small hands. But the other thing about this mouse is that it's not as TALL as some of the others. I now have a laptop on a small, crampy desk, and hubby bought me the MS Wireless mouse 3000 to replace this so I wouldn't have to worry about the cables getting in my way. But the wireless one is higher, so my wrist cramps up while using it. I'm back to the wired 3000 for now, and going to stores today to see if I can find a comparable sized/shaped wireless mouse. But if not, I'll get another one of these, because this one's starting to wear out (the cord is getting loose at the mouse end) after several years."
1,Comfort?,The scroll wheel actually hurts my fingertip to use. It's the most uncomfortable mouse I've ever used. I'll be returning this product ASAP.
1,"Terrible! Do not buy, wheel is unusable","I should have read the reviews before purchase. I own several older MS wheel mice and love them. As other reviewers have stated, the scroll wheel operates so heavily as to make it unusable. Very hard to turn, and slippery surface so your finger constantly slips on it.I don't know how this got past MS product testing. The rest of the mouse looks and works great, but the wheel is so bad it ruins the product. Returned the same day it was received. Lesson learned to buy something based only on previous product versions."
2,MS Mouse 3000,"Ease of use - It's plug and play, point and click. It better be easy to use. The scroll button is another story. The drag is a lot heavier than with most other optical mice resulting in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable feel.Form factor - Aren't most optical mice more or less the same form factor?Durability - Ok...Amazon wants a review on product durability a few weeks after receiving it. It hasn't broken yet. I guess something like this should last 5 or more years without any issues. Ask me then.Small size - No rating. I really don't see what this has to do with anything that wasn't originally answered in the ""form factor"" sectionOverall --- fix the scroll button!!! I am seriously considering dumping this and going back to my 5 year old mouse(HP)"
4,Purchased my second one,"After heavy, daily use (I'm a computer programmer) my original MS COmfort optical mouse got ornery -- the scroll wheel started sticking, and despite daily squirts of WD-40 it finally gave up. But I've been happy with the 5 or 6 years I've used it and decided to get a new one just like the old one. I like the side button and the ability to specify what each control will do. If I weren't a sourpuss about Microsoft, the company, I'd have given it 5 stars. I recommend this product."
5,Microsoft optical mouse,"good one. just used for one month or so, not sure about durability. Otherwise smooth and easy to use. Easy installation."
4,Optical Mouse,"Great mouse for your computer...Took a little bit of getting use to the different shape, but it is very comfortable to use... I like it."
2,Mouse hangs up and buttons decide when they want to work,"I hate the wheel button. It's hard to scroll. Bad for playing games. Although I don't use the magnifying feature on the mouse that much, it sometimes doesn't even work at all. The mouse hangs up often and doesn't move very smoothly."
2,You can do better,I found this dictionary to be very limited. Its format is primitive -- it does not group similar words together as some of the Langenscheidt dictionaries do. I did not find it to be very helpful either in travelling Bulgaria or as a reference while learning the language.
2,Not the best dictionary,"The best thing about this dictionary is its small size.However, it doesn't list any of the perfective verbs E-B or B-E.Whenever I come across a Bulgarian perfective verb I simply cannot look it up in the dictionary because it's not listed.If I want to translate from English to Bulgarian using a perfective verb, I'm out of luck if I try to use this dictionary.In fact, the dictionary in the back of the ""Intensive Bulgarian"" textbook is more comprehensive than this stand-alone dictionary.Very disappointing!!!"
3,Inadequate,"This dictionary is simply inadequate for serious study of Bulgarian. It would be more suitable for a tourist, used in combination with a basic grammar."
3,Too Many Errors,"Before purchasing this rather expensive aide to reading in German, people should be aware that the text is riddled with errors. While a two-page list of Errata is included, the situation is frustrating and directly affects the usefulness and reliability of the text."
3,A Short History of Reconstruction,This puts a face on the destruction of the South. This was mayhem upon the Southern States.
5,That's Scary Scary Stuff!,"What fun! The Bowery Boys and a haunted house, times 2! Add a bit of the legend Bela Lugosi and you have a night of shivers and laughs!"
2,So so,Hey! I read this book for school (I'm french so we had to read it)anyway...it's quite boring but there are some good moments in itso...if you don't like to read a french book...well...don't start with this one 'cus you won't want to read any other afterbut if it isn't the first french book you read...you might find it interesting...depending on what kind of book you like...
2,the three lives of karen,"As the director of the film I just wanted to address the one review the film received. The film WAS NOT based on her neighbor. How incredibly naive is that? It was originally set in California. It sounds like the reviewer has a lot of problems with the woman next door - and if one of our trucks crushed a flower bed, I apologize - but I'm sure she got reimbursed. Also, usually the neighbors receive some money for the inconvenience of shooting in their neighborhood. I won't comment on the artistic merits. That's for others to decide."
1,Junk,This part has moulded text right where the sealing surface is. You can see it on the picture but i was too inobservant to notice when ordering. It also has a cavity number molded on the other side on the same surface with rough surface flashing. The text on the surface will guarantee you an leak and I can confirm the OEM toyota part DOES NOT have any molded text on this surface. I wouldnt even try it as the sharp edges around the cavity number marking will probably damage the otherwise good seal.Very poor quality design.The part I ordered is going straight in the trash.
2,Make sure it will do what you want it to do.,"I was dumb and assumed I could use this to expand the iMac desktop to a two monitor system. My fault for not decoding the word, ""mirroring."" Anyway, I plug it into the Mac and connect a CRT VGA monitor that is capable of 1920x1200 and then turn on the Mac. The Mac now dumbs down it's own display to 800x600 along with setting the VGA monitor to that setting. For some reason, the Mac can't set the VGA or it's own monitors to good resolutions. I realize that what a cable looks like is more important to some people, but how it and it's computer operate is more important to me.Yes, I know about going into the menus and changing the resolution settings, yes I know I was expecting more of this cable than it's designed for, and yes I'm unable to find cables sexy, so I'm not a true Mac-head. But, I'm writing this in hopes of making it clear what this cable does specifically with an iMac and a CRT VGA display. Pass the kool-aide. :-)"
4,"A nice collection, but a little short.","This collection has 10 familiar songs. The true find is ""Here Comes Summer"" by Jerry Keller. This song is hard to find, but tells of true love separated by summer vacation. ""I Saw Her Again Last Night"" by the Mamas and Papas is one that is not anthologized too often. ""Beach Baby"" is a three minute blast of pure innocence. And who can forget Tommy Roe's ""Sweet Pea."" The sound is also good, considering the age of the music. The only drawback is that, at 10 songs, there is plenty of room on the disc for other songs. Still, it is a disc for the price."
4,I love the Remixes of Drowned World and Sky Fits Heaven!!,"I love Ray of Light Album first of all and it is my favorite album. Drowned World is a great remix and I wish she sang in it more. It talks about fame over love and and how much fame was more important to her than love until she had her first kid Lourdes! Sky Fits Heaven is a A++ song by itself and the remix is out of this world! It talks about spritualty, gospels, and wiseman, I love it!! I highley recommend this Maxi single to Madonna fans that do not have this won yet!!"
4,Great import for Madonna fans,"Seeing how U.S. critics have reacted to the AMERICAN LIFE lyrics makes me understand why she chose not to release this one stateside, nonetheless it's a really top notch song. This import contains the excellent album version, a really amazing club mix by BT and Sasha, as well as Sasha's take on ""Sky Fits Heaven"", which is less enjoyable, but still quite listen-able. For the Madge fan, it's a good choice, plus this is one of those rare occasions when a b-side also got the remix treatment (another example being the remix of ""Waiting"" on the U.S. ""Rain"" maxi back in 1993)."
3,"OK, but not great.","I had high hopes when I started reading this book. I had read Rhodes' other book, ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" and I loved it. It aroused my interest in the Hydrogen bomb. But I was disappointed. There was too much focus on the details of the personalities involved in spying for the Soviet Union and not enough technical information about the H-bomb. The ""Making of the Atomic Bomb"" gave some basic information about the H-bomb but left many unanswered questions. Most of these remained unanswered in this book. The amount of scientific knowledge added could be listed on about 4 or 5 pages! Maybe my expectations were too high."
2,Spies R Us,"Boring trivia about WW II era Soviet spies, which apparently was every 3rd person. You'll know how much they got paid, what they ate, how much they spent on train fair, and what they did while waiting to meet up. Hydrogen bombs.............not so much."
4,It is not the second part of a Pulitzer prize.,"This book has history, science and politics. If you have read the previous book ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" this new one will not result so exciting. It is very extensive in the politics and discussions behind the bomb, and scientists are not in the first stage. It is more a real spyonage history than a science book."
1,Not interactive,The other Boynton apps were great but this is just pics of the book. And it was the most expensive.
5,Love Boynton!,"I have loved every Sandra Boynton book that I have purchased for my daughters. They are short, silly stories that entertain through rhyme. This one in particular teaches different farm animals and is a lot of fun."
3,Too much of a good thing become tedious,"I concur with the previous reviewer who said that less of this would have been more -- there simply is not enough thematic material to sustain 64 minutes of music. If you already own ""The Western World of Dimitri Tiomkin"" (a great CD now out of print), you don't need this disk, as that one contains all the key themes and is sonically superior. If not, you may find this worth having. I suggest you burn some of the key tracks to your own CD and listen to that instead, as this CD is not really designed for listening pleasure. The program notes have some good information about Tiomkin's approach to scoring, but they're sparse on specific track information, particularly in that a few tracks seem to have been deleted from the final film. NAXOS deserves some kudos for keeping the Film Music Classics series alive. However, I hope in the future, they'll make CDs for listening first and for reference purposes second."
4,Easy to use,I bought this product for my Dad. He loves to pour over his nautical charts each evening. This product was easy for him to use.
3,hope it is not the last in the series,I did not like the ending but I hope this is not the last in the series it would be a big disapointment but over all it was a good read but not my favorite in the series.
5,"hilarious illustrations, albeit a cynical view","I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this being a children's book that a child would read by themselves - makes adults look like old, tired fuddy-duddies that have zero fun. Obviously, we come off that way to young kids and this book reinforces all the negatives and there are really no positives. This is a fun book for story time with your child, however - to laugh with them and to ask them what their perceptions are, etc. In every illustration, the child is either bored, annoyed, angry or disgusted with the bafoon adults who get to control everything. As an adult, I got a kick out of this page-turner - reminds you of how you thought of the adults in your life when you were a child and how we all end up growing up to be just what we used to loathe - tired, grumpy, controlling know-it-alls without patience."
3,"Easy read, but the story lacks substance.","I've read quite a few of John Saul's novels and I have to say I think I'm growing tired of him. This book just doesn't do it for me. His storytelling skills are remarkable but the plot of this book lacks intensity, interest, and believability. I know Saul can do better than this. If you are looking for a better JS book try God Project or Nathaniel. I give this 2.5 stars."
3,Abridged audiobook review - Rating 3.5,1) Pro: As usual Saul weaves a story around kids. This is his nitch and it is nice to read an author who keeps to what he/she is good at2) Con: The abridged audiobook version of this couldn't create the same level of suspense I suspect the unabridged version or the paperback version would create3) Pro: The performance by the reader is well done and at no time was I distracted by any shortcomings on her part4) Con: In the abridge version it seemed like all these killing were happening and no one character was putting the clues together.
4,Good book lacking a sequel,"It was slow in a lot of places, but it was a good story. What it needs is a follow-up though..."
4,Great resource,"Helpful, informative book on Jewish books. Great for librarians or anyone interested in what-to-read about Judaism."
2,Incorrect Product Description,This H-pipe is for long tube headers and is a two piece H-pipe. The picture used is not even close. The description does not specify this only claiming that it is for off road use only and it comes with OEM hangers. I was really disappointed since this when I went to install it it was the first sunny day in over a week. The only good thing was that I opened the box and checked it out before I picked up any tools.The construction looked good quality and the flanges and brackets looked durable but... this is not the exhaust piece I needed.
3,So much potential...,"If you're reading this, odds are you're already a Rage fan, so there's no point telling you how good the title track is. The real story here is the other two tracks. Rage seem to be taking the Pet Shop Boys attitude toward B-sides -- using them as a chance to experiment. In this case, ""Darkness of Greed"" seems to be an experiment in a pseudo-swing style, and it's hard to say whether it works or not. ""Clear the Lane"" is closer to the usual Rage sound, but De La Rocha's vocals seem to have a different quality to them, as though he were ill the day they were recorded or had spent several hours among Southerners. The lyrics are pure Rage, familiar territory to anyone who's heard any of their other albums. It's hard to recommend this album to anyone but the most die-hard Rage Against the Machine completist. The songs are good, but you'd be better off waiting a year or two for the inevitable B-side compilation to come out."
5,At last a real well written Book on Interest Rate Modeling!,"This book will definitely replace all the books on interest rate modeling- Brigo Murcurio etc. The book starts at an elementary level, explains every details of the concept, and then develop the subject matter one needs to know to be a pro in interest rate modeling. Even the simple concepts like duration, convexity are clearly explained that many other books take pages, and even then not very clear. Buy it, Read it! After all you will be learning from a master! The clarity and the writing style are simply great! Good job Prof. Jarrow!BTW: Neither Prof.Jarrow knows me nor I know him personally"
3,Incomplete,"This book is at its best when explaining the theory. Jarrow provides lots of very explicit examples that really help to illuminate the ideas. Unfortunately, the reader is left to fend for himself when it comes to implementing the theory. The author simply breezes over how to estimate and calibrate these models. There is a rich--but abstruse--literature on how to apply HJM models. This book would be greatly improved if it covered this aspect of the topic with the same care and detail as is devoted to the theoretical segment of the book."
1,Modelling Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options,"Bob did an excellant job on Derivative Securities and a horrible job with this book. All the tree pictures packed with discount bond prices, rates and risk neutral prob just confuse people even more. Read Derivative Securities and you would understand how HJM works better."
4,Small but nice looking,"Girlfriend picked this out because she liked the look.It arrived quickly and was new with plastic. It is very shiny and has a nice finish to it.It's kept the correct time so far and seems to be still working fine after a couple of months.The watch is quite small and petite which suits my girlfriend, but if your eyesight is not so good you will be squinting to read the time.D"
3,"High quality, low quantity","I gave this three stars simply because I feel that I recieved a great item, however for the amount I paid I feel I should have recieved more actual product. Perhaps 12-14 right angle tips and 15 feet of cable would feel more cost effective. Still if money isn't an issue you can't do better than these."
4,Impressed..,"I really enjoy using these cables with my pedal board. I was confined by the small amount of space on the board and now my life has changed forever. The quality of the product is definitely to my liking, but make sure you read the directions carefully before assembling these patch cables. I highly recommend. I would have given this product 5 stars, but they're just so freaking expensive!!!"
3,it was aight,"well....i just bought this CD this weekend...i knew it was all interviews but i was kinda hoping they would be new..unfortunately i was wrong, yes the interviews are cute, but it's all basic knowledge for any 'N Sync fan, like how they got together, why they don't have time for GF's, going on tour, nothing real exciting...probably the best part would be the ""oooooohhhh baby"" part, but its not worth spending, umm, 13 bucks for. and that british woman that narrates is SO annoying! god bless w/ love~ Reese"
4,I listened to samples...,"I think it was ok , what I didn't like was the chic talking a lot. I want to hear N SYNC, not some British lady!"
3,A CD and Booklet about NSYNC,"This Star Profile comes with an audio CD with interviews with the boys, and a 100-page booklet. The booklet is cool and has a lot of pictures, but it also has a few errors in it. The CD is interesting because you get to hear the voices of the members of NSYNC, but unless you really know their voices you may not know who is talking. The narrarator of the CD also mispronounces some things such as Lance and J.C.'s last names. Overall, it is a cool thing to have if you are an NSYNC fan."
1,Product was unusable,"I was happy to find that this product was available through Amazon. I usually purchased it through another site, but I really prefer doing business with Amazon. When I opened the first of the two bottles I purchased, I was surprised to find that the 240 capsules within the sealed container had fused into one large unusable glob. I couldn't get even a single capsule out of the container. There must have been some moisture issue. I shook the second unopened container, and found that it made the same solid sliding glob sound. I contacted Amazon, and received a return authorization. I'll be sending them back, and will unfortunately have to order my Creatine from my previous site. I'll probably give Amazon a try again in a few months just to see if this was a single bad shipment."
1,stuck together,"i read a couple reviews from people who bought this product from a different seller and they were not happy cause all the pills were stuck together and some totally melted into a solid block of goo. so i bought it from another seller and i received the same thing. the package was sealed under the cap, and over the cap. but when i opened it up, all the pills were stuck together. none of them were useable."
4,"Not a cosmological textbook, but a very entertaining read.","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. While its title may be a bit misleading (in that the vast majority of the book is not about proving the existence of ETIs, but of describing some very interesting nuggets of cosmological science).If you are looking for a definitive work on the science behind Extra Terrestrial Intelligent, this isn't for you. But if you would like to read a thought provoking book that touches on many different areas of terrestrial and extraterrestrial science, you may enjoy this one.I also found the sheer obviousness of his mathematical proof kind of startling. While it isn't a very sound theorm, it is still very interesting."
5,"Man, they're good","Where have groups with this type of energy been for the last fifteen years? This recording is definitely comparable if not better than their debut album, ""Gaelic Storm"". There is not a single dissapointing track on this CD. Although the content of ""South Australia"" doesn't seem very Irish, who cares when five individuals have as much talent and energy as Gaelic Storm does. From ""Drink the Night Away"" to ""The Devil Went Down to Doolin,"" there is not a single moment when I am not tapping my foot or doing a jig. Absolutely phenomenal."
3,American Greetings program,"I;had a newer version of creatacard on my old computer. When my son bought me a new computer, we could not find the original disc to install it. I only used the program for the reminder program so I wouldn't forget birthdays, anniversaries,etc. The version I received had a different reminder program which isn't the same type. I will still keep looking for the software I had on my old computer."
1,CreataCard Select 6,The program would not work ! It has a problem with resalution and will not activate. it says it will automaticly adjust but does not.
5,Good watch for the price,This is a good watch that combines nicely with your casual kakies or brown clothes because it has a creamy background dial. Includes a night light similar to illuminator technology of casio watches. It's a good watch for the price.
1,Didn't work,"My new memory chips arrived quickly and in great condition, but darn it, they didn't work. Despite confirming the modules were the correct DDRII style, the computer would not boot up. PNY provided excellent customer service, but indicated their modeules are 2volt while my PowerSpec computer from Microcenter requires 1.8volt memory. I removed the modules and sent them back."
4,Excellent but not quite as pictured,"Specs as advertised, works according to specs. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars across the board was that the advertised product picture included a metal outer insert (heat sink). The delivered product is missing the metal outer insert... just includes the bare chip."
1,Terrible product,The first time this was ordered one of the memory sticks did not work - returned and ordered another set. This time they sent the wrong speed even tho the packaging indicated it was the speed I ordered. Caused many many problems with my pc - would never ever order from this company again.
5,An essential release for lovers of trans-world psychedelia.,"This CD from Brazil's Mutantes is one of the most unique releases ever! The hybrid of campy bossa nova, vaudeville and mind melting psychedelia is sure to please fans of everything from easy listening to all out psych freakout. The cover art is great as well! Cheers to Omplatten for this series of reissues involving Os Mutantes!"
4,Good product - bad rebate,"Purchased product for $139 in Nov 2004. Works well, and relatively silent. Use it as an external hard drive (USB enclosure). No Problems with product. Seagate rebate was a different issue altogether...Rebate check arrived on 3/10/2005 (with an expiry date that I realized afterwards was 3/7/2005). I deposited check only to have it bounce because of the stale date (cost me $12 - which, of course, Seagate wont reimburse). Seagate has promised to mail me another check...Its April 30, 2005 today, and I was told I should get it in 5 weeks. 8 months to get $50...no wonder we all hate mail-in rebates."
2,Pure Novelty,"The premise of the game is quite good, but the gameplay is PSone standards, the graphics virtually are as well, and the involvement of wrestlers is limited to soundbites on the occaision a kill is made, or when their video for an entrance or victory is shown. A fan a wrestling games is 100 times more likely to like WWE Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth and a fan of car combat games is 100 more times likely to enjoy Twisted Metal: Black. Actually, fans of car combat games will curse the day this mess hit the stores, I imagine. Fans of both wrestling and car combat games may like this for the novelty sake, but will probably not enjoy playing it much. ..."
1,Horrible Game!!!,"I was really excited to hear about this game. When i finally received it from Amazon.com, I played it and became disgusted very easily. It is not a fun game. The actual play is too fast and much time is watsed driving aimlessly and not knowing where you're at or the other car is at. I don't reccommend this game to anyone interested in car battles. If you're a WWE fan, than maybe you'll enjoy it just for the the fact it features cars themed to your favorite wrestlers. I really enjoyed WWE Smackdown S.Y.M. and have to say that Crush Hour is a huge let down as a follow up game for the PS2. Shame on THQ and WWE for releasing a game so uninteresting and boring. I'm not shocked though as WWE has not even adveritsed this game on their television programs. It's an embarrassment for everyone involved!"
4,rotting christ has really given their best in this album,"No matter what others might say, I think that this latest album has given the taste to Rotting Christ mood. I followed them since their very first albums, but whenever time passes I feel much more charmed by their gloriousness. Hail to they souls. Hail your Cult Awaiting the next record"
2,Not Fully Functional on OS X with C4D,"Christoph is correct. Even though 3D Connexion claims that this device is supported under OS X and with Cinema 4D, it is basically a paperweight. Virtually none of the buttons work, and on their support forums the company refers complaints to a 2 year old thread where they claim they're ""working on it"". This company doesn't give a damn about Mac users but they want Mac users' money; that's the bottom line. Look to another company for your 3D devices on Mac."
2,Holler If You Hear Me,"after reading this book, i have decided it was not good. only reason i finished it was because my interest in 2pac, i would not reccomend this book to anybody with all the other books available on 2pac. i could not stand the way it was written, the author is horrible. he writes the book as if he has somethin to prove of his vocabulary, blurting words that can be substituted for more common words. however, he did have good references in the book. the only reason i give this book 2 stars is because i appreciate anything about 2pac."
5,bought it a year ago and it's still great!,"i got starcraft over a year ago and i still play it fairly often now. even after playing the game for so long and so much, i still haven't mastered the game and i probably never will. i played the single player game a little but i find playing with and against other people over the internet is the greatest part of the game.there are 3 races each with different strengths and weaknesses and i've found that after a year, i am proficient with one race and have fair knowledge of the other two races. there are so many different strategies that it will take a lot of playing to get tired of the game. i've been playing for over a year and i'm not tired yet. if you do choose to play multiplayer over the internet, i would recommend a highspeed connection such as cable or dsl. i've played a couple of times over 56k and it's worked fine but only with 3 other players at the most."
1,boring,I hate this game and don't see what evreyone sees in it I find when I'm playing this game theres only 1 way I can entertain myself making my units kill eachother and that doesn't do much. Yes I just got the demo but it was DEFINETLY enough to tell I hated it.I'm not going to be ignorant and tell you not to get it because I know alot of people do like it I'm not saying its a bad game but it is definetly NOT my kind of game I prefer C&C
5,Another Blizzard Hit,"If you liked wrcraft youll love this game. Excellent story line, 3 unique, playabl races, multiplayer compatible, and brilliant online gaming.This is the best rts game out (except for WarCraft3). You can use Zerg, Protoss, or Terran. The Terran are basicly humans, they are second in expensive and technologicly advanced. The zerg are a race of animals. They have the cheapest units,least tecnologicly advanced, and are able to multiply three times as fast. The Protoss are the most technologicly advanced and most expensive. Each race has their own set of individual units.The best part of the game is Battle.Net. The online gamig ps you against other players from around the world. You can play free for alls, allied games and special scenarios.Overall Battle Net will have you playing for months to come"
5,Well written and researched,I bought this book for my children since I am an avid Dylan fan and wanted them to know a little more about this great artist. My 10 year old son used it to prepare a report on Dylan for school. I read the book first and really enjoyed it. It's well written and informative. There were no glaring errors that I saw although I know more about Dylan's music than I do about his life. The author did a nice job at writing for the intended audience (children). I would recommend it for older children as well worth their time if they want to learn about a true musical genius.
1,TV burned out in 4 years,"Adding to the long list of commentary, this was a top-rated value in 2005 so I along with many others did buy it. Great picture right up to the day the screen went black in the middle of watching. Had a few red/blue pixels and then absolutely black screen. This is the first TV I ever owned that died. There is clearly an issue of quality with this Samsung product. $500/year of TV viewing makes for a ridiculously poor value. Stay away from Samsung unless they do something in the future to show that they actually stand by their products. And post to broader websites (rather than to just a model review here) so that Samsung feels the consumer backlash and other folks don't end up being suckers like we were."
3,Not really what I was expecting.,"This jumps around too much, and it's rather confusing if you have a hard time keeping characters (Who aren't very memorable.) in line. He should've kept the jumping around for the end of the book, or in a more suspenseful area. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone... it's going up on my shelf because it was a gift, not because I want to be reminded about how horrible it really is. This is almost as bad as Intensity, which I stopped reading a fourth of the way through because the antagonist/villian of the book made me want to bang my head against a wall."
4,Uber creepy!,"Night chills gave me NIGHTMARES and I'm not joking. I read this book some 20 or more years after it was written and I found it strikingly relevant to the times even then. I'm not a conspiracy theorist and don't honestly spend a lot of my day pondering whether or not I should wear a tin foil hat to block the government's secret satellites from shooting x-rays into my skull. But I do often think of the mind control theories put forth in this book and about how plausible it was presented even amid the back drop of such obvious fiction.The thing about Koontz is that he weaves characters that draw you in. Once you're sucked into their life, once you take them into your heart, you care about what happens to them... so when bad things start to happen to the characters in this book, well, you care.Koontz is positively masterful and this book is a prime example!"
3,So-So,"Not one of his best efforts, the usual government paranoia and an experiment that serves as an excuse for violence and sicko sexual escapades. I've got nothing against creepy horror btw, just think books like ""Night of the Beast"" do it better."
3,Good for the Price,"Not a bad book for the price; references the writings of Earl Mindell a lot so if you've read his books, this truly does not contain any new info on benefits of apple cider vinegar."
4,Roy Ayers Live!,"I am familiar with a few of Roy Ayers songs from back in the day (Running Away, Everybody loves the Sunshine), but I love live concerts & I really liked this concert. I have come to really appreciate Roy Ayers style of jazz/funk/r&b! Definetly a keeper!"
3,52 Activities,"The idea of 52 cards, each with one idea for a party is a clever one. It means you can mix and match to put together a party your child will love.Most of the activities in the pack are games, largely reworkings (or just renaming) familiar games. There also are some crafts and make-your-own-refreshments ideas. Ideas for party themes and destinations were mostly pretty run-of-the-mill.Overall, the card format may be just what is needed to get the creative juices going, but it's lack of any kind of organization may make it hard to find specific information. The playing card format would make this easy to carry around for someone like a camp director. The idea is creative, but the activities aren't."
2,usability and programming history,"This was a great book when it came out. I'm only giving it two stars because if someone reads it now, it is quite dated. There were parts I liked though, even if just from seeing ""programming industry history"":- how ""great"" waterfall is when you plan everything in advance. And even then recognizing a UI is not waterfall- a computer book cost $30 in 1992- In 1988 HCI was split between HCI and CHI as an acronym- why people were against change in going from line editors to the next step- the screenshots of old software to illustrate usability issues- James Gossling worked on the original windows management system referenced in the bookThere were also parts that were still relevant:- usability studies and art vs tech- users are like three year olds. if they all want a cookie, maybe you should give them a healthy lunch which is what they really need"
2,horrible,"this game SUX. I didn't do anything. I chose easy and yet you were still shot at alot. I spent so much time figuring out what to do, and shooting my gun at the same time. I didn't try multiplayer even i thought it would be good. THQ sux. luckily i rented it. you should do the same if your thinking about this."
1,Rip-Off,"The authors have essentially taken the innovative work of American scientist Rod Swenson who proposed the Law of Maximum Entropy Production (that the world acts to reduce energy gradients at the fastest rate available) over two decades ago and are presenting it as their own. The ""Law of Maximium Entropy Production"" as proposed and elaborated by Swenson in countless papers showed why in his words ""the world is in the order production business"" and resolved the question that previously had seemed to put physics and biology at odds. This was a ground breaking insight which the authors, had to be aware of, and here want to pass off as their own. I find it amazing that such a book got published. The best one can say is ""sad""."
4,A Referencial dissasembly Guide,"May have one if one has bought an used pre-2000 gsx r750.RATHER focused to disassembly down to piston and rings and carb needles or injector nozzles with detailed procedure and to do thatTHAN to description of various compornents's working mechanism.* Tremendous quantity of greyscale snapshots (not diagram) while disassembly procedure.* differences between production year are depicted in several tables and wring diagrams* need more diagrams in generalNot perfectly addquate for just studying mechanics with a book that describes dissembly of top-end superbike. The aspect of direclty describing structure of the bike is rather weak in this book than as in usual some stock manual that accompanies bikes when purchased(The manuals are shallow in depth, but this book is very detailed describing the service procedure)."
3,army suit,"I wasn't very pleased with this. The arms are too long & have to br rolled up, while the legs are way short so I had to take pictures from the knees up. I would'nt recommend it."
4,Lies...and truths,"I read ""Beautiful Lies"" about three weeks ago...finished ""Sliver of Truth"" last week.I decline the opportunity to summarize the books, but would, instead, encourage each reader to do that for himself.I found the plot for both stories to be strong and entertaining, well written, and masterfully executed. The writing style...warm and wonderfully informal.I would have given these books five-star reviews if not for the frequent, jarring, verbose, and poorly timed descriptions of people, places, and things that disturbed the flow of these otherwise excellent stories. The writer seemed far too sophisticated for that misstep in all other ways. Example...near the end of ""Sliver of Truth"" the writer described an injured child'd need for validation. That portion of the story was as well written as anything I've read...ever.A memorable and poignant tale that I'm happy to have read."
4,Slow to start but excting at the end,"Everyone else has summarized this story so I won't get into the content of the book. I was debating in the beginning if I should continue reading this. It was a very slow and somewhat confusing start. Then suddenly--Bang----it went into full speed ahead and twisted around corners with a lot of fast paced excitement. I was rooting for Ridley and Jake, then for the FBI agent, Dylan Grace and hoping Max was really a ""good"" guy. But things kept changing. It's not a book to do power reading or fast skimming. You must read every line or you'll miss some of the action. Honest. And you don't want to miss any of this action----up until the very end.Pour yourself a glass of wine, sit back and enjoy every word. It's a great read-----a fun ride."
3,TaiChi mind and body,"The physical aspect of the tapes are good. The sound of the ""mind"" tai chi tape, is poor. You can hear it, but it's not a ok quality of sound."
5,Awesome,"One of the songs of this 2000 CD is just now appearing in the latest Goldie album. I believe he was the first DJ in Brazil to play Jungle and ever since, he's been ahead of everyone else. Highly recommended!"
4,Happy with it,Wishlist: that the Heart beat sensor was on the vertical handles too.Pros:works as advertisedCons:Chews through batteries.No real regrets and I would recommend it to a friend.
2,Argh!,"I found this book poorly put together. (It could not seem to decide between light humor and horror). I was curious about the Natives and thought that the ending was a bit of a cop out. The largest problem I had with this book, however, was the subtle feeling that the charaters are not represented correctly. I cannot see Jadzia Dax as being afraid, for instance. And Quark is not really a coward, he just does not see fit to hide his fear when it strikes. Don't even let me get started on Major Kira and Kai! All in all quite disappointing read."
5,Nice small elegant watch,"I bought it for my daughter 1.5 years ago. It works fine, looks nice, no scratches so far, it still works on the same battery. It goes in a elegant box - very good as a gift."
2,How could he do this to us???!!!,"I'm a fan of Chick Corea since the late Sixties. I really do not understand how such a talented musician could ever have produced such a boring record.I've always sustained that impeccable technique does not necessarily result in good music. Well here is a crude demonstration of this theory... How could he do this to us?It seems that Chick Corea is now more interested in spreading L. Ron Hubbard's ""philosophy"" turned into ""religion"" than in making music. This will by no means diminish his place in the history of jazz. But I'm so sorry that he gave up on music...This record deserves no more than one star, but I'll allow a second one for the sake of Chick Corea's glorious past."
2,maybe the next c d,"when I first read about the reunion of the Elektric band, i was so excited about it. Order the cd immediately when it was made available. This cd is unlike the excitment i read in the report, the compositions are amazing still but lack the fire of the earlier recordings. Nevertheless, it's still a collectable cd. I too hope for a reunion of rtf, or at least some of the songs re-arrange in the Elektric band style. The next one would be better."
2,"Tired, tired, tired","Judging from the other reviews, I'm not sure another one is needed, but I want to share my disappointment with this album. I should have listened to it before buying but, like the other reviewers, I have plenty of other Chick albums that I like a lot so I trusted him. But this one . . . I should have known from the concept -- space travel. How tired and played out. And the music is just as tired as the concept. He really needs to go back to the drawing board, because his music is really not happening right now. This album is a failure."
1,Ideology > music,"Jazz is all about inspiration, and inspiration is the diametrical opposite of ramming a book into notes. And this is what CC did. He would say, he had let himself be inspired by Hubbard's novel, but this is like painting a smell. Of course you can do it and claim how inspiring the smell was, but this is not art; this is ideology. And à pro pos, who would listen to music that tries to turn an ideology into sound? And re. Scientology: Who would listen to ""Jazz"" written by, say, an explicit Nazi who stresses how much ""inspired"" he was by ""Mein Kampf""?"
2,The Terrible Toaster,"Over the years I've had several toasters and all have performed acceptably but this overpriced unit is unbelieveably bad at doing the job. I tried several slices in different positions and all came out toasted on one side with virtually no browning on the other plus the left edge of all slices were burned black. Unless you want it for an ""art"" display in your kitchen get another brand. I'm going back to my old Cuisinart which has worked flawlessly for years."
2,De'Longhi DTT980 Toaster,"This toaster is a great art piece. It is elegant and fun to watch it go down automatically when you put the bread in. It is easy to clean.It toasts unevenly and it is impossible to set the time properly. Toast is eithor burnt or not cooked or raw on one side brown on the other. We spent a lot of money for this toaster hoping to get a good piece of toast. A twelve dollar toaster would do the same job.I do not know if there is a good toaster out there but this is not the one. If I could get my money back I would get a different toaster.It is a shame that you can't try these things out before you buy them. We looked at a lot of reviews before purchasing. The reviews were mixed and therefore of little help. Let me summarize: save your money, don't buy this toaster."
5,Nice change from the older Biggest Loser Workouts,"I workout with Biggest Loser and Jillian Michaels DVDs 6-7 days a week with my husband. We both enjoy this tape. You can make it easier or harder depending on your weights.Currently, I use 2lb weights to make this more of a cardio workout. I feel the burn but am able to do another workout the next day.A lot of people seem to dislike Anna and/or Dolvett. I find both of their training methods to be a welcome change in my daily routine.I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Loads of fun...,"""Wolf's Trap"" is a brisk cross-genre romp that contains genuine scares. A burned-out cop who turns feral at the rising of the full moon chases a serial killer who has a personal reason to hate him. William Gagliani is known for his short fiction and some terrific reviews for magazines like Cemetery Dance. If you're a horror fan, give his first novel a try, it's loads of fun."
1,All the recommendations fooled me...,"This sounded like a really good book. All the reviews of it seemed to be positive. But I just couldn't get into it. The style of writing was so slow. I can pick up a book by Brian Keene and be sucked in on the first page. But after about 80 pages of Wolf, I had to put it down. Sorry, that's just my opinion."
1,Disgusting,This book is about child abuse and killing women. The werewolf aspect is incidental. Painful book. Do not buy it.
2,- for the translation.,"(Five stars for Roussel) I was wary of this translation, having suffered through Heppenstall`s wretched and disrespectful ""translation"" of Balzac's SPLENDORS & MISERIES OF COURTESANS (which he called A HARLOT HIGH AND LOW!). It was so inaccurate, with so many phrases added and removed, that it was an actual impediment to understanding the original French.Until now, this was the only translation of Roussel's IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA. But, glory be, Dalkey Archive has just published a new translation by Mark Polizzotti -Impressions of Africa (French Literature Series). Comparing the first three pages to the French, I was amazed at how close he comes in meaning, yet keeping it a (relatively) fluent read. Highly recommended over this disgraceful trash."
5,Excellent Album!,"This album not only has well thought out lyrics, but KNO's productions are spectacular. I'm fortunate enough to be living in Albuquerque, home of LA Underground, and I bought my copy there. My copy actually came with a second disk of ALL instrumentals...so for those of you in the Albuquerque area who are looking to buy this CD, stop by LA Underground, and you'll get a second disk!"
4,Solid LP,"I've always been a fan of the Cunnin Ones. From Will Rap for Food to SouthernUnderground, even enjoyed the Sloppy Seconds they served. This LP is definitly a different sound from the prior 2 Lps. From the Production to the lyrical content. The punchline rap style definitly takes a back seat in this album. Its more of a.. should I say ""storytellin"" album, but still brings the Cunnin sound. You'll notice the Mr. SOS doesnt appear frequent on this cd. I believe he's on only one track. Definitly a disappointing aspect of the album. He's replaced with and emcce named Natti, who isnt as polished as Mr SOS but doesnt take away from the album.Kno again does his thing. After hearing the ""White"" album i was looking forward to hearing some new material, and I definitly was pleased with what I heard.Overall I would strongly recommend picking this CD up. it would be a nice addition to anyones collection!"
4,"Practical, insightful and functional","Dr Rail shares his experience and insight into body language in a clean, clear and direct manner. Are the concepts simple? Yes. If you're looking for in depth scientific theories into the world and science of body language, there are other books and resources to turn to. But, as Dr Rail clearly expresses in his book, his goal is not to overwhelm the reader with concepts that are too detailed to be used in a practical manner (the science of micro expressions for example, which are normally practical for the layperson when there is recording equipment present). Further, this is a work that comes from more than a ""nice in theory"" stance, as all the concepts in the book were used by Dr Rail for many years in very extreme and high risk situations.However, if you are looking for more in depth, real world examples of this work (and more), I do recommend Dr. Rails latest book, Surviving the International War Zone [...]"
3,Acadamics have a fit - literally,"In the stuffy world of British academia, nothing changes -- that is, until Tom Sharpe decides to liven things up a bit with his tale of a crusading college Master who horrifies all his colleagues with his trendy left-leaning ideas.Porterhouse College, Cambridge has been a bastion of privilege since time immemorial, turning out the kind of bluff nincompoops who have been running Britian for centuries and who do themselves so well at table that thee is a local version of an apoplectic fit, known as a Porterhouse Blue. The beneficiaries of this stultified atmosphere do not plan to give up their pampered lives easily, and oppose the Master with every devious scheme their dulled brains can come up with. Their machinations make for a typically enjoyable Sharpe romp, though without the savage anger which made his South African novels such page-turners"
3,Soundtrack material,"If you are looking for something as grand or even vaguely like ""Place Where the Black Stars Hang"" then look elsewhere. Good clean, very dark production, but very soundtrack like. Not a journey into the uncharted, and if you heard ""Black Stars"" you know what I mean. If you are looking for a dark, spacey almost industral jazz, here you go."
2,"Great and yet, not.","This is what I have been looking for. A travel size gadget that has encyclopedia, dictionary and thesarus. And, this has much more that I found useful and fun. Not including foreign language capabilities, which I did not want as a feature.So, why only 2 stars: there is no backlight on this. In a well lighted room, it is not easy to read. Sitting on an airplane, using a reading light, it is just to darn difficult to read. I'm sorry to say I had to return it."
4,Good Game,"May be difficult to install on XP. You will need to go through the ""Help and Support Center"" in the 'Start Menu"" and then click on the following:1. In the section where it says ""Pick a Help topic"", click on ""Music, video, games, photos""2. In the section where it says ""Music, video, games, photos"", click on ""games""3. Under 'games"", click on ""Fixing a games problem""4. Then, in the section where it says ""Fix a problem"", click on ""Getting older programs to run on Windows XP""5. Then click on the link that says ""Program Compatibility Wizard""6. Click ""Next"", then choose """"I want to use the program in the CD-ROM drive"".7. Then under ""Select a compatibility mode for the program"", choose either ""Microsoft Windows 98/Window Me"", then follow the instructions from there."
4,"Very tasty, a bit too hot for me","This was very good, full of flavor, but a bit too hot for my tastes. I guess I didn't expect the amount of heat that it has. But the chunks of potatoes are big, the chick peas aren't mushy, very good."
3,Less expensive direct from Tastybite,"This is a really great Dish, the spices are perfect and it's the best packaged Indian I have had. But, I found you can get it for much less direct from Tastybite than the price here for the same 12-pak."
5,Cute!,I bought my 4 year old grand-daughter a doctors kit and I found these scrubs on-line to go with it. They seem to be of very good quality and they're so cute!
1,Not received yet,"Unfortunately, I am not due to the receive the book until 10 October so I cannot review it. Regards, Colin"
5,"Not Much to These, hard to be faulty",The quality of build is nice. Allows for the surface of the keystone jack to sit flush to the surface. Some of the cheaper ones do not have a frame behind the surface of the panel. This results in the keystone jack standing proud of the face of the surface plate. This makes for a much less clean installation
3,Good Book,"I have only reviewed part of the book. I want to travel to Senegal and I purchased the book for that purpose. The book provides a good general overview of this country. It needs more detail, but the book has to cover such a great number of countries that you can't expect too much detail on one area."
5,Bizarre Love Triangle,"And a charming triangle, splendor despite being a not conventional story is touching and lovely , Veronica cannot decide what is the best for the child shes expecting after a season living with her two loved best friends Zed and Abel whom maintain a sexual relation with her in a ""friendly"" sense but then Ernest came along, a sucessfull independant movie director who falls in love with Veronica and seems to be the rigth guy for her and her coming child, her mind tells her that, but her heart tells her to keep the relation with Zed and Abel so theres the crossroad, you gonna have to find out what happens at the end, in other hand the soundtrack is awesome, New Order ""Bizarre love triangle"", Blur , Slowdive (amazing band), House Of Love , Suede, wow!!!!!! a transition from 90s and the new millenium.HM"
5,wow.,ooh.. at 100 bucks its a bit too expensive to own right now.. but rent it when it comes out.. its such a wonderful movie.. yeah.
3,Loved the Gerard factor but just an ok flick,Enjoyed young Gerard in action but definitely a B movie. OK plot but i didn't believe some of the characters. Not great character development. Still worth the six bucks i paid.Loved the leopard undies on Gerry!
1,I am so disapointed!,"when searching for ACTION figure, note the word ACTION there is no reason for this figure to come up. He is in a permanent pose, no action possible whatsoever! I am very displeased by this misleading header! If anything this is a STATUE-not an action figure. It is a real rip off for my kid-who wanted an action figure. He is handsome, it is a nicely done statue-but no at all an action figure. Vendors should NOT be allowed to place him in this category."
1,Garbage,Opened box--installed batteries--tried to set time--clock reset for no reason--after 1/2 hour of frustration--bounced off wall--repacked pieces in box !!
1,What alarm?,"OK, the thing does actually make a sound when the alarm time is reached. However, it is so high pitched and low volume that it would have to be taped to my head to wake me up. It's a nice clock and temp gauge, and I would love the nap feature, but it will awaken only the lightest sleepers."
3,clock,alarm needs to be louder. easy to use. night light is good. price is right. nothing to add to this review
2,Too beepy,"What I like:1. Ability to see time, date, and alarm time at the same time.2. Runs on batteries.3. Attractive blue illumination.What I don't like:1. All the buttons beep, making it difficult to set the alarm late at night without waking up my wife.2. The display is tilted back so far that it's impossible to read the numbers when you're level with the clock, such as when it's on a bedstand next to your head. You really need to be a foot or two above the clock to read it."
1,"easy to use, but display","Features are good and usage is easy.The problem is display. Numbers on LCD is only visible at a certain angle, otherwise it is blurry and you cannot see.Display even get worse when you click on light button to see at night. I always need to take it into my hand to bring it to ceratin angle so that i can see. Very poor quality LCD display,I wish i could return it but I put all packaging into trash. Probably will put it into trash soon, as soon as i find another clock with bright display."
3,A decent travel alarm clock,"The clock works well and is easy to use. However, the only bad point is the alarm itself is not loud and if your a deep sleeper you may sleep right through the alarm itself."
5,This Is Amazing,"I bought this 5 days ago and I have seen everything on this game. I saw Gamespots review and they said it had bad graphics and bad gameplay wrong. One thing way off on the graphics alot of time you can tell was put into the visuals and frps on this game. The gameplay is so awsome there is a season mode and a demolition derby you must unlock the derby one. There is a Raw level Smackdown level and Survivor series level. Royal Rumble level, cage match and about 6 more other kinds. You start with 23 charecters ranging from Kane to Stacy Keibler to the Undertaker and Brock Lesnar. Then weapons well i'll only say there is over ten weapons and each charecter has a special weapon that annilates them. For [the money] don't hesitate pick up this game. I did this review to get everyone to see this game by either renting or buying it you can't judge it by the looks of the cover."
2,Poor quality and speakers F**Ked,Looks like Alleurs(sp)LCD. Wait for DVI type with better quality. Speakers are useless w/soundblasters or THX systems.
2,Don't buy it!,5 dead pixels (in different colors); Color is not even (especially when black screen); objects will stay on the screen after previous screen. Pictures are fine. Returned!
3,Performance for price better than expected,"Considering that I paid only $150 for this (after rebate), I cannot complain too much about the 1 dead pixel near the edge of the screen. You get what you pay for, and I wanted a low price LCD. I am not going to send mine back since I can live with one dead pixel. If this would bother you, you might want to stay away from this brand since dead pixels appear to be pretty common. And yes, the built in speakers are very weak and require amplification of some sort to be useful. Otherwise, colors and response time seem to be fine for my needs, but I am not a gamer."
4,Frustrating!,"This toy is kind of cheap! The wings keep falling off and they're hard to put back on. Also, I can't find an action figure to buy that will fit in the pilot seat..."
4,Best GT Advance yet! And all known cheats yet.,"I already have this game, and I love it.You can upgrade your cars,you can choose 3 different tracks highway,street, and circuit.The fastest car is Nissan SKYLINE GT-R BNR34 tunedAnd Here are some codes:For all the cars in the game including the fastest is hold L+B and press left <-v clearfor all upgrades hold L+B and press up ^|for ex mode hold L+B and press down you know (DOWN).for all tracks again,hold L+B and press right on your D-PAD ->I HOPE THIS REVIEW WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU"
1,not the same as it used to be,"i had a boat 15 years ago that i used amazon teak oil on and loved it. it was thick like motor oil and it would stay where you put it. i purchaced a new/old boat and had to protect teak so naturally i ordered the best. well that is when i was so disappointed, the oil i recieved was nothing like what i used in the past. the new oil is thin , almost watery, i think i have more oil on the floor than wood. i would recommend minwax, 1/2 the price twice as thick."
3,shipping was fast but the game not so much.,"I think getting a xbox, ps3, or a wii is a better way to go. But shipping was fast.."
2,Not worth the high cost!,Its just an average case and made of imitation leather. You can't use it as a wallet[...] because it got openings at top and bottom even when closed. Cards and money can drop out of the pockets.Not worth the price unless its on clearance ...
5,In my estimation one of his best.,I have not read all of Jerry Bridges books but I have read about five and I think this is one of the best ones yet. I like the balance that the author writes with and the call to holiness but through grace and not any sort of self centered legalism. This is an excellent book for any one wanting to grow in their walk with the Lord.
5,One of the best,"I really loved this set. It went way beyond what is out there these days. So much music gets released, you sometimes worry that stuff like this gem might fall through the cracks. Luckily, it found its way to me, and I'm glad, cause I don't go clubbing much anymore. If I had to choose 1 CD to take with me on survivor, this would be it! When I first heard the CD, CD 2 was the one I liked most, but after listening for a while, 1 is my fav. Its hard to decide though, they fit together so well. It's a complete soundscape. Not only that, but if you play both CD's in a row, and then repeat, they still fit as if one big piece of music, quite amazing really. I listened to this CD a lot on a driving trip across the US in late summer, and it was a perfect soundtrack for all the amazing things you see, rainbows, lush green forests, cool rock formations, fresh air, and awesome sunsets.If you have limited funds, get this first, its money well spent."
3,it's worth it,"The art style is interesting and the soundtrack is unique. The gameplay is like a skating game except puts a twist on it with the addition of graffiti. The controls for the GBA are simple but hard to get used to, but otherwise the concept, music, and visuals are worth playing for."
1,Not worth the money,I consider this a waste of money. It quit working less than 2 weeks after I bought it. My little girl was very disappointed.
3,A little too POP.,I eagarly awaited this new release by the newsboys but found it to be a little disappointing. There are a few good tracks but the overall feel is that it is a bit too pop for my tastes. I would have preferred a little more rock and roll.
2,Can the Newsboys be......Boring?,"Unfortunately yes. I previewed this cd at a Borders Books and Music store and said, oh no this isnt very good. Now your only given a random 30 seconds on the machine so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bought it when it came out. Sadly the album was boring and well...not up to par. There was one great song, I Am Free, other than that, 2 were okay and the others just well...sucked. The few good points to this album was that unlike some of the newer Christian groups, the Newsboys have kept it Christian and I commend them for that, however aside from the Christian element the lyrics are simple and boring. The other good thing was that you could hear more of Phil Joel in the backround. Ive been a fan of the Newsboys for over around 10 years so its hard for me to give them this review but I just want other fans to know what they are getting into."
4,2006-2007 Annual Supplement to The Piano Book: Buying & Owning a New or Used Piano by Larry Fine,Extremely helpful in wading through different types and ages of pianos available to buy.
1,DONT BUY!,"it is VERY obvious why this so inexpensive. It doesnt work at all, no syncing or charging on my 3GS. i bought this cable solely for the little clips that hold the cable in the connector port as it shows in the picture, but the cable i received looks exactly like the cable that came with the iPhone, the little one without clips but black. i was going to use it to make a hand strap for my iPhone. ([...]) i am very disappointed with this, it is completely useless. total waste of money and time."
2,very poor quality,"bought a couple of these since they were so cheap. should of just bought the more expensive ones. these lasted about 1 month before falling apart. some lasted longer, some lasted not quite as long but they were all gone very quickly. very poor quality, would not buy these again."
4,"It is good, but Restored was better","This album is not as solid rock as his earlier releases. I actually didn't know much about Jeremy Camp at all until I went to the Virginia Beach,Va libraries and checked out his albums about a year ago. I love some songs on this album such as Let It Fade, Give You Glory, and Give Me Jesus but the others sound more like an experimentation with pop or other music styles. I do like artists that have quite a bit of variety and style in their music, but Jeremy Camp is hit or miss. You get the feeling that it's more of been there, done that with other artists that are accustomed more to christian rock. Its good, and I like Jeremy Camp but his songs can't touch Mercy Me's All That Is Within Me album! That album is by far the most impressive in my whole collection so far! More creativity and inspirational songs like the ones I mentioned need to be in there."
4,"Yes, it's a little different. But give it a try.","I love Jeremy Camp. He is one of the best things to happen to music (especially Christian Music) in a long time. The CD is not his usual and there are a few things I would say about it coming from a musicians point of view.1. Sometimes the lyrics are a bit redundant. He rhymes words like seen, needs, memoRIES, vacanCY.... it goes on and on like that the whole song. As a songwriter he should know that sort of makes the song sound like a nursery rhyme. Maybe that's the effect of having two kids.2. This is petty but he frequently uses the word CRAVE randomly. Maybe it's just me but I do not think this is a good word for describing how you need Jesus!Overall, it is a newer, lighter, cleaner Jeremy Camp and I appreciately his work. It is not the usually LOUD rocker we are used to (with the exception of track 11), but if you buy for no other reason, buy it for ""Give Me Jesus"". It's simple, but powerful stuff."
2,Such a great beginning and such a slow sad decline.,"For fans looking for a return of the sound of Stay you will be sadly disappointed. Those who wanted Jeremy to go more ""CCM"" well then you've got what you wanted. I have loved many artist who over there career have changed there style from a more aggressive/heavier sound to a more gentler beautiful sound (Jeremy Enigk is one) yet in all those cases the artist had a talent that enabled them to make that leap. Jeremy Camp really had his honesty and raw sound to make him stand out in the soft sounds of Worship/Christian music. Sadly a star in the unoriginal genre has now conformed to the staples of this genre. So once again if you find your a fan of artist such as Steve Curtis Chapman and Carmen well then you've found your new fav CD. Enjoy why I go on looking for worship and Christian music still worth listening to."
3,More rock pop,"This is more produced than he earlier stuff. THe songs just seem weaker to me. I dont know if it is because he has much more a hectic schedule than writing his earlier stuff.The album is worth a listen, and had a few hits on the radio."
3,do your research...,I purchased this case to make a HTPC. One of the main factors was the cool little LCD display on the front. WRONG it is just a little empty window. Turns out that the lcd model is a different one and it is not availbe for sale in the USA (what I read on another site after purchase). The case does look good but it looks half finished due to this. The door on the front for the DVD drive does not allow the user to push the eject button on the drive so you would have to upen the large door and then push eject... or do it thru windows. Also the door in the frond catches on the tray of my dvd drive not allowing it to go back in. The blue lights that are displayed in the picture are not like that at all... they only light up a small portion of the area shown. it needs to have 4 led's to do this instead of the 2 that are in it. I probably would not purchase this item again given the option.
5,Great HTPC Case,"This case has worked out great for me. I specifically bought it to use in my entertainment system. The plugs on the front allow my wife to quickly plug in her ipod to the USB or for me to plug in our camcorder to the firewire. The case has enough internal and external drive bays to expand. The external drive bay doors are concealed very well while one slot allows the DVD drive to eject a movie. Finally the case comes with enough fans to keep the computer cool in even my tight space. The noise is minimal. The only con would be they don't ship the LCD with the case, even though the window is there. I suppose the LCD comes with the media edition. I didn't see the value in it. The money was better spent on a gyration mouse and keyboard for the coffee table."
4,CLASSIC TV SATIRE OF THE 1960'S,"Sixty-two minutes of the best of the satiric revue broadcast on NBC Television between Jan 10, 1964 and May 4, 1965.With (among others) Woody Allen, Steve Allen, Nance Ames, Jerry Damon, Bob Dishy, Pat Englund, David Frost, Buck Henry, Henry Morgan, Phyllis Newman, Dick Noel, Elliot Reid, Mort Sahl and Allan Sherman.Featuring the wonderfully irreverential songs of Tom Lehrer."
2,eats batterys,this would be a pretty cute toy but the cost of batterys is too much. We bought two for our grandsons. They are 4 and 6. The toys talk and make machine noise and light up and dance too. One we can understand the robot talk the other is a little more muffled. They look cute on the shelf. It comes with a remote. The kids understood how it works pretty quickly.
3,An extraordinary life,"Barbara Hepworth is an exceptional artist not yet sufficiently appreciated. That is why this book contributes to better understand the work of Hepworth, who was a contemporary and friend of Henry Moore, by describing her difficult life both in the personal sphere and also in her professional struggle and achievement.Festing begins from an undoubtedly neutral point of depart, but the more she knew about Hepworth the more she became a vigorous praiser of her and of her work as well.From the early years of Hepworth's career to the very day her studio in Saint Ives, at the west end of Britain, got fire and consumed her place and her life, Festing describes Hepworth feelings, thoughts and works, in a fluent and deep text. We have to thank the autor."
5,Terrific book on the Mafia and the times during rise/fall,"Really enjoyed this book, as I was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island (1960-1980s). Many of the stories presented explained what most people saw happening around them.. largely ignored or overlooked by local authorities. Great book for those that want to see the extent that organized crime can corrupt commercial and government organizations, regardless of size and power."
3,Okay,I bought these to use on hardwood floors. The floors didn't get scratched but with the covers over the sliders they dragged a bit. I would recommend them.
4,Portable Crazy Taxi isn't half bad,"Pick up a customer, drive to the location, drop off, repeat - all within a certain time limit for each customer. The basis of Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride is simple but so addicting. If you've played the dreamcast or other version you know what I'm talking about. I love the whole concept of Crazy Taxi and the GBA version conveys it nicely. The sound isn't horrible but it can't compare to Offspring and Bad Religion. My only complaint is the graphics which are choppy, but that issue is ignorable. This a great game for any one looking for a game just to pick up and play anytime."
3,Loved it!!!!!,"JUST LIKE ME, is a great short film starring ""Christina Sampson,"" but why doesn't the star have top billing in the credits and on the cover. Upon further review and research it was founded that Mr. Roberto Lombardi also produced the film and owns the studio as well. So why did he let this happen to the star of the film???? Perhaps we'll never know....But for the film and it's leading lady it was a real pleasure to see fresh talent like Christina Sampson bring some very entertaining scenes to life. Even though it may be a short, Sampson's performance is something you will remember for a long time."
4,Good but missing a few,"Good Collection but missing a few good hits like ""Put some Drive in Your Country"" and ""Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof"" also ""If I Lost You""Overall a good collection worth having but they should have made this a 2 disk set with more good songs. Also ""Bible belt"" is missing.I bought it and I like it. It's worth having."
4,OK replacement,"They do the job, the fit well, and look better than the scratched originals. Hard to accept that chrome covered plastic costs so much."
5,Love it,"I purchased this set about six months ago. Installation was simple. Have used it everyday since. Great picture, decent sound and I love the foldable, swivel screen. My daughter uses the DVD quite often and no issues there either.Since I have this set hooked up to an HD antenna in my attic, I was able to watch TV during a recent power outage. I just hooked it up to a portable battery (also highly recommended) and it powered the TV for about 5 or 6 hours between charges."
1,Will Never Buy Another One,"Product arrived very quickly. Was working very good for just about a month when it lost all power. Clock wouldn't even light up. Returned it to Audiovox with problems of where to send. It was returned two to three weeks later and still did not work. It had no signs of even being dismantled. Returned it again. Had to pay all the shipping charges myself even though it was still under warantee. Amazon was good enough to reimburse me a credit on the shipping. It was returned approximately three weeks later. It worked fine for five months and died again. There is no TV picture and of course, the warrantee has expired!! Nothing but trouble"
1,Very disappointed in this TV,"I purchased this TV in Nov. 2008 after our other under counter TV was fried during a power surge. I was first disappointed when I received it because it didn't have closed captioning (I'm hard of hearing), but that was ok I just turned the volume up. Now the picture has gone black (you can still hear the sound). For about 1 week you could turn it on/off again and the picture would come back on but now it is black all the time. It hasn't even been 2 years yet!!! I think $245.00 is a lot of money to have not work in this short of time. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!"
3,Picture Quality Disappointing,My wife spends a lot of time in the kitchen and has always wanted an under-the-counter TV. In comparison to wall units this unit is disappointing. You would think that with a small screen the quality of the picture would be fantastic but it is not. For some reason you have several levels of picture quality. None of them give you a great picture. The radio and the dvd are OK.When this one dies I will buy her a wall unit.
4,Almost perfect,"This is a good product, but the one I received after refurbishing was not showing an LED screen. There was no way to tell time or see a station listed on it. All in all I perceive it to be a very good product, especially for a small room."
4,Great TV but Radio doesn't measure up,"This TV was purchased for my kitchen and cable was hooked up to it. Some channels were fuzzy and some were clear. Had to put a cable booster on the cable hook-up to make the channels clearer. Once done, all channels came through very clear. I am very pleased now with the picture quality. As far as the sound, it is clear but not very strong, especially the radio. The radio sounds like as small battery operated hand held radio. I didn't really get this for the radio, I wanted cable in my kitchen so that I could cook and watch my shows at the same time. So, all in all, it is the perfect little TV for my kitchen once the booster was hooked up."
3,Its OK,"This works as expected. It replaced an older audiovox under-counter unit we had for 5 years. Picture quality is ok, sound is ok. Haven't tried the DVD - not sure why anyone would on this unit. I really wanted an under-counter WITHOUT a friggin radio or DVD. Adds quite a bit of bulk unnecessarily to the unit. You would think these manufacturers would realize music is streamed from an ipod / phone hooked up to a base unit & if I'm going to watch a DVD, I'll do it on a real TV.Anyway - this does takes care of the jones my wife has for her morning show while she gets everybody off to school."
1,Not going to buy audiovox products again,"Unfortunately, this was a rare case when electronic equipment broke 4 month after the installation.But AUDIOVOX warranties their fine electronics for 3 month only.Which means, that I have to through that piece of garbage for $200 out...Thank you, audiovox for the nice new years gift"
2,Good while it lasted,Picture went after 7 months. Cost to repair was more than the original price of the unit. It was a Christmas gift for mom. Hope she enjoyed it for the few months it worked.
5,Very Happy!,I love my Audiovox Drop-Down TV. The picture is very good on the TV and the DVD player works great. The sound quality is very good...my Cds sound great! Would definitely recommend purchasing this item!
1,Don't buy this one!!!!!!!!,"I have the same problem as some other reviewers.....have owned this tv for a little over a year and the screen now has completely gone black. I could turn it off and on a few times to get it to finally come on, but now it comes on and the screen goes immediately black....very frustrating. I am now shopping for a new tv to replace it...any suggestions??"
1,Nice while it lasted.,"Purchased in May of 2009 and screen went blank Nov 2009. Great concept and fits nice in kitchen, however, due to reliability issue, would not recommend purchasing this unit."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this item last Christmas. By June, it was malfunctioning. While watching a program, it completely goes blank, and after a few minutes, it will come back on, on a different volume level, and different station. After repeated calls on the customer service line, and numerous emails, still no reply. Such a waste of money! I got what I paid for, $200 of ""shame on me"". I should have done research instead of buying was professed as a good deal. I will think twice next time!!!!!"
1,"Nice feature set, but horribly unreliable","Bought the previous version of this model despite all the negative reviews. Unit had a horrible high-pitched ringing noise whenever it was idle --- fortunately, the device was for my parents, who are both hard of hearing, so we got around it by just unplugging it whenever we visited. Now, though, the DVD player has stopped working. All in all, very disappointed."
3,I have a question.,"Does the screen swivel??? I am looking for one in my kitchen to get the current one off the counter, i need the counter space. When it is folded up does it take up a large amount of room under the counter?"
4,under counter TV,"This was relatively easy to install and worked well from the start. The picture is good, it recognized all local digital channels."
5,The most original band to come around in long time!!,"Suicide Sound Machine is full of wonderful songs. The song Kiss prescription, I wannna new crush to live for and skinny fingers are so well written and played. I am really suprised We Ragazzi haven't gotten the national exposure they deserve. The whole album is great and you will not be disapointed if you get it. I think lyrically the album speaks for itself. I cannot wait for We Ragazzi's new album which is available now. If you have a chance to go see We Ragazzi in concert I suggest you do. Tony Rolando is an excellent performer and the rest of the band is extremely talented too."
1,Can't Stop Blowing: Snooky Pryor,"The last four selections: Selection #10, #11, #12 and #13 were all defective and could not be played. This was a re-order of this CD because an older CD of the same title, in which selection # 12; I heard The News had gone bad (eventhough the initial CD that had gone bad had not been purchased through Amazon.com)."
5,Golden Oldy,"The reason to buy this DVD is the 1937 version of The Prisoner of Zenda. A DVD of the great Ronald Colman is always a cause for celebration -- and in this one, you get two performances by him in a double role. The supporting cast is top notch -- Mary Astor, David Niven, C. Aubrey Smith and young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. almost stealing the show. Deborah Kerr who plays the princess in the 1952 version is doubtless a better actress than Madeleine Carroll from the earlier version, but the gracious Miss Carroll was born to play royalty. A great swashbuckler and a classic from the Golden Age of Cinema."
1,Utterly Ridiculous!,"After reading some reviews for the 1952 version of The Prisoner of Zenda, I decided to check it out. It is horrible; I can't take this movie seriously at all. It has nothing of the elegant drama and charm of the Ronald Coleman version. I love the book and that version is at least faithful to it!This version, however...the entire feel or it is just stupid. The king has a ridiculous lisp, and the actor is nothing like he should be.The entire cast of the '37 version is much better suited for the story.Also, I read in several places that the '52 version was supposed to be a close remake of the '37? It isn't. Stick with the good ole days of the graceful Madeleine Carroll and the handsome Ronald Coleman!"
5,My Favorite Cookbook.,I had to purchase a second copy of this cookbook because I wore the first one out. The recipes are failsafe and delicious !
1,"There's inexpensive, and there's cheap.","And this is CHEAP.I'm here shopping for a new toaster for our office because this one filled 2500 s.f. with smoke. We've had it maybe 6 weeks, and the toast support in one slot began sticking at one end almost immediately, meaning you have to reach in with a knife to fish out your toast when it's done because it's stuck and won't pop up. It wasn't a hazard until today, when it got stuck so much that the heating element wouldn't turn off, and someone's bagel turned to hockey pucks. Now we have everyone's personal fan blowing around the kitchen, and the building office on notice in case the fire alarm goes off. During the weeks it did work, it unevenly cooked the bread, and took FOREVER (which is why the employee felt OK walking away from her bagel).The only good thing is that I've been approved to spend up to $40 on a better toaster to reduce liability. We didn't want to bother with a replacement under warranty."
2,very much like torture,"Kenley ruined the show. Austin is so annoying at times. This season was the worst. I like the show, but I wish they'd get rid of Michael Kors. He's obnoxious and a terrible designer himself. Skip."
4,"VERY loud, anoying alarm clock","We purchased this clock as a Christmas gift for my daughter who just can't get up in the morning. She hasn't had an alarm clock loud enough to wake her and therefore she would go back to sleep and be late for school most of the time. This alarm clock is VERY loud and VERY annoying and it also rolls itself off the table so you just can't reach over and hit snooze all the time. Just what she needed to get up in the morning, except when she forgets to turn the alarm on. For myself, this clock is too much but perfect for a person who can't get up to a regular alarm clock. Only gave this 4 stars because I feel the price is high for an alarm clock even if it does roll around the room."
1,Cheap Knock-Off,"I just opened the box and checked the item. It isn't Clocky the Alarm Clock but rather a cheap knock-off of the product. It didn't say the name Clocky anywhere on the box but rather just says ""Alarm Clock"" with instructions in broken English. Plus, when I went to the website to check what box it should have come in, it looked nothing like it. I am extremely disappointed. You can bet I'll be sending it back for a refund. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS NOT CLOCKY."
5,Excellent Choice,Great clock for the person who has trouble hitting the snooze button. It forces you to get up even if you are having those rough i dont want to get out of bed days.
4,What the Hell was I Thinking?!,"It does what it's suppose to do too well...loud, annoying sounds that make you want to throw the thing up against a wall...when you catch it!"
3,will scare the crap out of you every morning,"This alarm clock does what it is promised.It sounds like an alien landing on full blast.It is so loud and scary when it goes off that it wakes you up enough to turn it off, but if you are like me and have a terrible time getting up you'll just get back in bed."
4,It works sometimes.,I don't always wake up to this. It's not loud enough. It will wake up everone else in my house (everyone else sleeps two levels above me)except for me. It does its job well when I can actually wake up to it. I sleep in a basement so it has plenty of spots to hide in. I must say I'm still very fond of this thing. I just wish it was louder!
1,Broke After the Return Period Expired,I wanted to get something fun to encourage my son to wake him self up but I should have known better than to get a gimicky item... It was cute for a month and then it only worked about 2 days a week and then it died completely. What a bummer!
4,Wrong color shipped,"I ordered the item in aqua, it arrived in mustard yellow. The mistake was discovered too close to New Year's, and I ended up paying extra for express shipping of the (hopefully) aqua-colored item."
2,"Everything is great, except quality","Everything is great, except quality, 'made in China' label proves it. Clocky can jump only from small height according to the manual, so I put it on bedside table and there was a carpet in the room. Anyway after two weeks sound stopped working and my Clocky became just silent clock :)."
1,"Fake Clocky by LilGift, LLC","Yes I thought I ordered from Amazon.com (hence the higher price) but it was only fulfilled by Amazon and it was sold by LilGift, LLC.It is a fake and it says Alarm Clock and some cheap cheesy box that looks like it belongs in the 99 cents store.It does look exactly like Clocky in the picture but it is not the same thing and does not have the Nanda logo anywhere. I am pissed I spent $50 for a fake clocky... even though they are probably made at the same place but I don't care it was misrepresented and it gets one star! Very disappointing Amazon, now I cant give this gift to my GF and have to deal with the hassle of returning.... do yourself a favor and look at the seller on this item very carefully!!!!!p.s.I would buy this thing for $15-20 if it was as advertized"
5,I've been converted!,"Having never been a morning person and guilty of being late everywhere I went, I can thank Clocky for converting me into a respectable 28 year old who gets out of bed the first time the alarm goes off, not hitting snooze every 9 minutes until an hour or has passed and I am late to work. The first morning clocky went off I thought I was under alien invasion but I leapt out of bed with the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas morning. Clocky's wheel keeps falling off but I keep putting it back on and she gets the job done. I heart my clocky and have told many people how wonderful it is!"
2,Skeletons from the Closet,"I'm not a big fan of the Grateful Dead, but I purchased Skeletons from the Closet for ""Truckin"" and ""Casey Jones"", and those are the only songs that I cared for from this cd."
2,Poor quality,Very poor recording of Arturo Sandoval. The engineer never adjusted or equalized the microphones. Instruments were barely heard. Video quality not goos as well. Sorry.
2,Poorly written; quite disappointing,"I disagree with all the other reviewers. The plot is weak, the character development is non-existent and the writing is amateurish. Sexton can't hold a candle to either Roeder or Donaghe. I know it's his first book and allowance should be made for that but I'm suprised that Sexton found a publisher for this story. It's not worth the purchase price."
2,"We used to call this kind of thing ""Corn Porn""","Those early morning info-mercials peaked my husbands curiousity about this over advertised series, so I bought it for him. We were both embarrassed whenever we turned it on. A guy stands there and asks girls to kiss, or perform some specific act, they oblige and he offers real time commentary like, ""Wow""! Its softcore, poorly filmed, and embarrassingly corny. I feel sorry for the girls as they come off as willing fools. Maybe of some interest to a pre-pubescent, but will not do a thing for anyone with any kind of sexual experience."
4,price difference,"this dress is very sexy, and alluring. the price is a little bit different from the other dresses. the other dresses are a different color. please adjust the price."
5,J-U-I-C-YYY!,"Brenda M. Hampton is a gutsy writer. If you like juicy stories that read at a non-stop fast pace, then this is definitely the book for you. This book is non-stop entertainment. With characters that are so real and you may feel that you know them personally! I enjoyed this book throughly and I looking forward to reading the next book from this Author. Curl-up with this book and get juicyfied!"
5,THE ROAD TO THE FINAL FOUR,"All novels written by Miss Brenda Hampton:My Best Friends Man, Two's Enough Three's A Crowd,How Can I Be Down, and My Way Or No Way are the BOMB! I had the pleasure of meeting this author a few weeks back, and since she was so genuine and beautiful both inside and out, I thought what the hell...I've got to support this sister definitely trying to do her thing. I read all four books in 3 days. Couldn't part with either of them for nothing in the world and when I sent her an email about my experience, she replied and made me feel my money was even more worth it. She's a writer that comes with a package of unbelievable talent, creativeness, and has much love and respect for her fans. Other writers should learn from her and if you haven't made your way to the final four, like I have, please don't let them pass you by."
2,Low-Budget Compilation of 70's Hits,"This is a low-cost, low-budget compilation that could fill in gaps in your collection of 70's hits. Please be advised that Woodstock is performed by Matthew's Southern Comfort, not Joni Mitchell as indicated on the song listing. Also, Kiss You All Over (Exile) ad Free Bird (Lynard Skynard) are NOT the versions you are used to hearing but are alternate studio takes by the original artists. The rest of the cuts are original, though, and the sound quality is o.k. but not great. There are no liner notes, but what do you expect at this price?"
2,Lots of trouble,"These have been nothing but trouble for me since I bought them. When I opened them, the pages of stickers were stuck together and the colors had transferred from the white flower onto a pink one and likewise. Two of my large flowers were ruined. Also, I had to flatten the pages under heavy books for over a day because the pages were folded into thirds to fit in the package. The stickers never really lost the fold marks from the packaging and have already (within a month of application) began to peel up and off the walls. I was really disappointed with this set of appliqués. If you do purchase these, I would suggest being very careful separating the pages when you open the package and set something heavy over the pages for several days to smooth out the folds."
4,Good Practical Advice,Good practical advice for improving data quality. Covers the most common data quality problems. Well written. Some other sources to look at online:http://www.dmreview.comhttp://www.datalever.com
3,Another boy band... not bad.,"While they don't have the harmonic prowess of N'Sync, or the marketing punch of the Backstreet Boys, the songs are polished, forgettable, danceable and fun. These guys need to work on developing an original sound, or look, or something if they want to grab a larger piece of the boy-band pie. This disc will grow on you with repeated listenings. The song ""Tu Y Yo"" is a standout ballad, but the entire album is filled with finely-crafted pop songs, and the singing is first rate."
2,Just Not Good,"i bought this disc thinking it had to be a fairly good movie because of Ida and Andy. Boy was i wrong, it was agony to sit through this boring movie.don't waste good money on this. wait for it to come on cable or tv, or just plain ignore this flick."
4,Pretty good product,I only use it in the evening to remove make-up and it doesn't bother my skin. I can't say it did anything to help my though either because I don't have a skin problem.
4,Love this product,"I have very fussy, sensitive skin. In the winter, this is perfect. Not too drying, evens out skin tone, keeps minor acne away. In the summer, I need something stronger. That is not a fault of the product, it's just my skin. I say give it a try and see what happens."
5,Never live without it!!!,"I have been using Philosophy for about a year now, I ran out of my Cleaner and tried another brand .... Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Purity Made Simple One - Step Facial Cleaner it is worth every penny. Thank you Philosophy."
5,Very gentle cleanser,"My husband and I have very different skin types and both use and love this product. It is very gentle, non-greasy, and washes away easily. I have very sensitive skin that both dries and breaks out easily and have never had a problem with this cleanser. It leaves your skin very clean and soft. It is also very economical as you only need about a dime-sized drop to wash your face. We keep one in the shower and one on the counter."
3,Just Ok,I would buy again if cheaper. I think I'll try another brand next time. Cleans and smells just okay. Fin.
2,Made me break out,"I really wanted to like this product. Priced right, smells great, feels great, and the reviews were all great both here and at Sephora, but it make me break out. I don't have acne issues at all, never had. I continued to use it for several weeks but it just left me a little oily. I have normal/combination skin and I'm still in search of a good cleanser and moisturizer. Trying Murad now."
2,Mediocre for gluing crystals,I make couture evening dresses and typically hand glue on thousands of crystals onto each dress. I tried this glue when I could no longer find Delta Jewel Glue. Sobo glue did not work well for me and I do not use it. Sobo glue runs thin and is not as strong as other glues like Delta Jewel Glue and Crafter's Pick Jewel Bond.
5,Terrific CD - amazing guitar work!,"I could write an extensive review, but some of the others on this page already say what I have to. Buy this CD if you like guitar, whatever style you're into. Dave is one of the best. In a league with Beck, Clapton, Hendrix, Holdsworth, Keaggy, Johnson, Vai, Van Halen, Stevie Ray, etc., etc.. Get the drift - it's excellent!"
2,uncensord?,"THis movie claims to be uncensored but they blur her butt when she climbs onto the railing of the boat to jump into the water. What is up with that? They don't do it anywhere else in the movie. Also, the picture looks like they ripped it straight from an old vhs tape. Very disappointing."
4,woman of desire,"in this movie we can see the spectacular bo derek in the role of christina a temptress who is not afraid to use her desires to get what she wants. when her wealthy boyfriend ted hires a retired cop jack to captain their yacht, passions ignite at sea where jack finds himself a pawn in a game and there are no rules. in their world, there is nobody who will appear what he appears to be. and the only one who knows the truth is dead...."
3,Women of Desire.,"Not bad, but not one you'd care to see again. Bo is always gorgeous and that makes the purchase worth the time and expense."
2,Not as expected!,"I just received this bird toy today and it is not much for the money. I know it stated the size, but I thought the blocks on it would be much larger. My parrot will have this thing chewed up in 10 mins. It is so hard to judge an item like this just in a picture. I would consider my parrot being of medium size.Super Bird Creations 10 by 5-Inch Katy's ABCs Jr. Bird Toy, MediumI would send it back, but it is more trouble than it is worth.I just noticed the price has come down now on this toy. I paid $11.87 for it and it is now $10.77. Oh well, my loss! But I still feel it is too high in price. I just bought another toy someplace else and you should see the size of it. I got a lot more for my money and it only cost $2.00 more.Oh my gosh, I now see it is $8.95. Now I really feel ripped off!"
2,Entirely Derivative,"A transparent pastiche of ideas from The Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars, The Matrix, Lord Of The Rings and Carlos Castaneda, among others. Nary an original theme or plot twist in the book.Balfour has tongue-in-cheek fun with the Bay Area and Las Vegas locales, and since I live in San Francisco, I enjoyed some of that. Mainly, though, the story just recycles tired sci-fi and fantasy cliches.Did he think we wouldn't notice?"
1,"all surface, no inner lives","A chassidic woman married to an orthodox jewish manfor seen years and no children. There's no law that says such a couple has to have children, but if they don't, it's a stark contrast from their respective traditions and to avoid dealing with it, as the author has, means there's much to the inner lives of these characters we aren't learning (I wonder if the author has even thought them out). This is just one example of the sort of short cuts that drive me crazy in this book. Such an approach to the ""little"" things leaves me entirely unconvinced regarding the supposed ""big"" themes of this novel."
3,Regret and Renewal,"The challenge of any novel about a dissolving marriage is to not leave the reader wondering why the couple got married in the first place. This novel barely clears that hurdle.Deena's childhood in Jerusalem is described in warm, glowing terms. Her life with Daniel is dry and conflicted. Daniel is an observant, Orthodox Jew who follows the letter of the law -- until it might interfere with his growing infatuation with a blonde co-worker who has come to New York City to compete in the Miss America pageant.It stretches credulity that he is unable to recognize his own betrayal. It's even harder to be patient with Deena's reluctance to give up Daniel."
3,A Story Told Too Often,"This was a quick and easy read. Pearl Abraham is able to capture details that the reader can relate to. Unfortunatley, this scenario happens too frequently, not enough thought put in to the relationship before marriage.It was interesting however how the author's insight into Deena's denial and ""allowing"" Daniels other relationship.Daniel's character wasn't developed, which was disappointing, but maybe the author only wanted us to see it from Deena's point of view.The good thing about this book was it was an easy and entertainong read.The bad thing was it is a sad story that is told too often."
5,A great score.,"I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie (when it was supposed to be released during the summer of 2004) and thinking it looked visually imaginative. Then it got pushed back to dreary September, but I still looked forward to it. I didn't quite enjoy as much as I thought I would, but the music really stood out. Great themes, excellent action cues, Edward Shearmur (totally unappreciated) does some of his finest work."
3,Attractive but not very bright,"Three gorgeous actors in a beautifully shot but weak-on-plot Hong Kong melodrama.Andy Lau's wife dies and her heart is donated to a woman whose cheating husband just happens to look exactly like Andy Lau (seriously) and whose body eventually rejects the heart. We're supposed to get all weepy and philosophical wondering if it's the heart that one loves or the body, a worthy ponder. But in point of fact the filmmaker just wants to give Andy an excuse for having two women to play with because he's such a big star and needs two leading ladies to make the math work. He's awesome, differentiating his two characters by varying the amount of peach-fuzz around his mouth. The time-hopping plot and doppleganger aspect make it a little hard to follow. No tears, but very pretty.NOTE: I guess there is no way of knowing if this is a Dual Audio release. Make sure you can return it if it's a mainland, Mandarin Audio dub and not original Cantonese."
4,YoYo Ma Dvorak Album,"YoYo Ma is YoTo Ma. When it comes Chello, YoYo Ma and Dvorak combo cannot be beaten if you appreciate Chello concerto. The recording sounds bit quiet but otherwise it's another success by YoYo."
3,Great artist bad mix,"Yo Yo Ma has the perfect tender and romantic feel for Dvorac. Unfortunately he is not a powerful performer. He is relatively subdued and that is okay with this music. The fault on the very first selection, the concerto, is the recording. It is though he is in the middle of the orchestra playing with everyone else. There is very little presence given to him by the engineer in the mix down. This is very unfortunate. The listener must pick out the lead performer.I used to 'bury' musicians when they weren't up to par for the good of the whole recording. Everyone including the musican were grateful for this. However, Yo Yo was not having a bad day, and you never bury the lead. Shame on you guys in the booth.The rest of the album is just fine.I suggest purchasing Jacqueline du Pre 'A Lasting Inspiration' for fine cello and very fine recording and if you compare the two you will understand exactly what I mean to convey."
4,Dvorak Concerto,"A beautiful redition of the Dvorak Concerto. Not big and boomy like von Karajan and Rostropovich, but delicate, precise and emotional. I'm not saying the aformentioned is bad, not by any stretch. But, the contact the player has made with the work, in this case, cannot be beat."
5,One of Franco Zeffirelli's finest!,"Love, Love, Love this movie/opera! Zeffirelli makes opera come alive with his unique way of filming and Stratas, Domingo and MacNeill draw the viewer into their heartrending story. This is the movie that 1st opened the opera world for me several years ago when I saw it on PBS. Beautiful scenes in the country & on streets, as well as the lavish Parisian home, make one feel a part of the story, not just a spectator of a stage production. The english subtitles are the icing on the cake, enabling one to understand every moment of emotion & drama. I am so grateful to Franco Zeffirelli for the gift of understanding opera!"
5,Giving authors their due,This wonderful book's authorized publisher in the US is only Charles Scribner's Sons--not Peter Smith. What's the story with this?
2,Very disappointed.,"This looks great, but it breaks at every section. I'm very disappointed in this bracelet."
4,Helpful and Limited,"This manual is an excellent study tool. It is limited to the odd-numbered problems. It has the same answers as are in the back of the book BUT, the manual provides a complete step-by-step procedure for how the answer was arrived at.I bought mine used from a reputable seller on Amazon and it was in as good condition as a new one and much cheaper than the college bookstore's price, even with S&H;."
1,NEVER GOT THE BOOK,"Iput in a order for this book and never got it, so I had to go to the book store to purchase it. Don't need it now too late."
1,How NOT to discipline a child!!,"This book is an utter disgrace. In fact I feel so strongly about it thatI am going to seek to get it banned in the UK! My child has been beaten black and blue - and my ex partner gave this book to me when my son was a toddler. Chuck Stugeon, ought to be ashamed of himself for writing such utterly cruel, non Christian garbage.This book is dangerous in the wrong hands! DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Just Not for Me,"I had high hopes for this book, but I ended up getting rid of it. I just didn't agree with it."
1,Not appropriate,"This replacement faucet is too large for my Big Berkey water filter dispenser so cannot be used. Costs more to return than it is worth so will need to ""bite the dust."""
5,Fast Service,These spigots seem to be hard to find locally and I was desperate. This item arrived very quickly and was just what I needed. Should have ordered 2 for down the road.
4,does not drip,"faucet works as intended so far, the seal at the container is pretty straight forward, and seals without issues. The faucet itself has not sprung any kind of leak."
1,DON'T BUY THESE IF YOU WEAR GLASSES,"Despite Amazon's listing that these can be worn comfortably with glasses, they ARE NOT compatible with glasses!!! You will not be able to see with your earwarmers on if you are wearing glasses! Amazon claims that this is not a return reason that was their fault & will make you pay shipping to return them, which is HALF THE PRICE - not worth the trouble. THE DESCRIPTION IS A LIE - these don't adjust & they could easily break your frames. I HATE THEM & I am thoroughly disappointed & doomed to spend the winter with cold ears or looking like an idiot with a scarf tied around my head."
1,WORST GAME EVER CREATED,"The graphics are shameful, the cutscenes are bizarre, and the car handling is an abomination. I wonder if Ubi Soft knew that they were making such a joke. Even though its cheap, don't buy this game, rent it if you're actually interested (and if you are, I pity you)..."
5,Absolutely perfect!,"The whole collection gives a warm, festive, sitting in front of an open fire, feeling. Augustine(Piano) and Cecil(up-right Bass) composed some of the nicest variations on these familiar Christmas classics I've ever heard. Up-lifting yet un-obtrusive at the same time. There is a similiarity to the ""Peanuts, christmas time is here"" but Augustine and Cecil are an increadible team that play off of each other more effectively.I highly recomend this for Jazz lovers of all fields from Standard to Acid. I personaly am looking for more of thier works. Oh yeah,I forgot, Its just Bass and Piano nothing else!"
3,Dromedary Daze,"I've been shopping on Amazon for quite a while now, but this is the first time I can remember being disappointed by a product that I've bought. When I first saw this DVD for sale, I thought it would focus more on the camels and how they are trained for racing than on the events surrounding the race. Had I known that ahead of time, I probably woulndn't have wasted my credit."
1,Disappointed,If you are expecting Sufi sounds and lyrics I wouldn't suggestthis CD. It was in English and sounded more like a 60's folk song album.Very disappointed.
5,Down To Earth,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
2,"Get the Other Version, The Video is a Waste","The other version of this single, commonly available for only a few dollars, has the same three audio recordings, plus a fourth not on this version. The Video on this version is nothing special. The soundtrack is just the common album track of You Are My Sister, and the visuals are nothing more than film of about 20 beautiful people turning in circles. No images of Antony, no live performance, You may even stop it part way through, and just file the disc on the shelf. Get the other version of this single. Now you know why it is out of print."
4,be a part of Stim History!,"K-Os said ""Hip Hop's not dead / it's really the mind of the Emcee!"" True Hip Hop is far from dead, and is beyond alive within the mind of Stimulus. Support Stimulus. Support TRUE HIP HOP!"
3,Hurlbut's Story of the Bible,"My Mother had an old 1938 version of this book. She wanted another copy to give to a woman who was trying to learn more about the Bible. It was advertised with no cover, however a very ragged cover showed up. She cut the main part off and placed in the back and gave to the woman, who said it was a help."
3,safe for kids (not breakable),"It's cute and safe for kids (not breakable), but the pump does not angle down at all and soap tends to shoot out straight at you. That part of the design is a bit annoying."
1,not disco of the 70`s,"These songs are not disco songs of the 70`s. They are all from the 80`s and they dont sound anything like disco. If your looking for a disco CD, dont buy this."
3,need a pc badly,"this pc configaration is ok... but as i'm a poor student from Bangladesh so i need this kind of pc. so my request is please give me a pc, with which i will continue my computer science classes."
5,Not just for salmon and fish,"Besides all the wonderful fish you can make with this spice/seasoning try it in other ways... add to the flour in your turkey roasting bag and shake vigorously to coat the turkey; add to cream cheese and sugar to stuff spring rolls, etc. Yummy!"
5,A Confession Worth Reading,"For years I've been telling people about this wonderful novel. Rogers' CONFESSION OF A CHILD OF THE CENTURY is wise, witty, well written, fun to read, and full of fascinating twists and turns. It is a delightful book. It is a coming-of-age book in one sense, but the author is interested in broader aspects of culture, family, politics, and history. Hopefully, Rogers' new novel--JERRY ENGELS: A NOVEL--will generate interest in the author's earlier work. This novel, as well as THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, derserves a wider readership. It is a shame that Rogers' work is not better known."
1,Porter Cable's Reputation,I bought my Porter Cable RT-7610-5 about 6 years ago. I needed it for a project and it worked like a charm. I have recently taken it from my garage to use again and guess what: the exact same problem all you guys are getting.The front lazer points so far down that it doesn't even get out of the window. It just clicks and whirls away without doing anything. I have tried for hours to recalibrate it but all to no avail.Prior to this I thought Porter Cable's reputation was a good one. Well I've changed my mind after buying this very expensive plastic brick.
1,Stay away from this product,"Just like some other reviewers, I just used it once and later never came back up again. I tried to call the company and talked to CS (who claimed as the manager/Lisa Smith) and she said that I need to just buy a new one (???)."
1,Watch it on youtube instead,"If you just want to watch it, the whole thirteen minutes of the video is available on youtube. Go to the link: [...]"
1,Ho hummmm ......,This book is a series of letters between Charles and Lizzie and their sexual exploits at a school for wayward women for Charles and a harem for Lizzie ....For eroticism to work at all there has to be at least some kind of cursory seduction for goodness sake... This book just get right into the scene without much of an interaction between the players at all .....I mean whats the fun in the wham bang and no thank you mam kind of writing.It gets one star cause thats all there is ....
3,A Decent Album,"This album is an average rap album. It has moderate beats and lyrics. There is also a reasonable amount of filler. ""You Don't Know"" is a decent club banger and ""No Apologies"" gives us a glimpse and a reminder of the old eminem before his encore album."
4,Not the return of shady.....yet...,It's a good album but it's not exclusive eminem music.Stil i strongly recommend this if you are an eminem fan.
3,Not TOO bad..,"I'm glad I borrowed this before buying because I really would have felt it to be a waste of money. I understand this album is supposed to be getting the other groups names out there, but personally, when I'm in a mood for Eminem, I want to hear Eminem. Not the people he is trying to promote.Some of the songs are good, but it is NOT what I expected from Eminem. Personally, I didn't mind his crude, in-your-face lyrics that were present in previous albums."
2,Weak Mixtape/Album,"Can't beleive people are still listing to this nonsense,Eminem fell off in 2000 and 50 has been mumbling since he got shot the same year.Power of the Dollar is the only thing worth listing to by that guy.Fishscale was by far the best rap album of 06, Ghostface has been rapping since the early 90's and can still tear up an album.Go buy Ghostface's Supreme Clientele and hear him dissing 50 on the last track."
1,uhhhh,"This powder is horrible. Do not purchase. First of all, there is NO color whatsoever in either of the 2 'colors' they come with. Secondly, I have very sparse eyebrows so any color would show up that I put on.... but not this one. I am throwing it away."
2,Anglo-Saxon Dictionary,I am not a student so it does not benefit me to have this type of dictionary. I need to trade it in for a more sutable one
1,Huh?,"What was that? I had to delete it. For the student of what? I just didn't get it. A bunch of abbreviations, and of course, no way to key in a specific. Had to begin at the A's and click and move onto the Z's with information that served no purpose for me."
5,DIARY OF AN AIRBORNE RANGER,"A LRRP'S YEAR IN A COMBAT ZONE...This was an excellent book. I just bought the book 2 days ago, and just finished it tonight. I had to read it every chance I got. The hell these guys went through, detailed explicitly in this book, is amazing. The honor and courage that these men showed, went above and beyond the call of duty. Definitely a must read, especially for those who have been in the military, and especially for those who have seen combat...it has certainly brought back memories for me....."
2,Not Impressed,"I wish I could say I liked this book but I didn't. There was so much talking about all the fights he got into growing up and repeated throughout the book. Numerous people were mentioned and I didn't recognize the majority of them. Then a lot of the phrases he used throughout the book I didn't understand (guess I'd have to be from New York to get it which I'm not). He had a lot of poetry in the book which I'm not into. I did like where he talked about his family which he obviously loved and the house he bought in the country and acquired various animals.Unfortunately, instead of keeping this book I will donate it to the local library."
5,Bare Escentuals liner,"Excellent product. The liner is easy to apply with the liner brush and stays put all day, even in humidity. I won't go back to traditional eyeliner."
1,gift,"This was a gift for my daughter in law, who's birthday was Oct 24th. As of today I still have not received this product. I have called and was told that it would be re-sent and have not recevied it. Maybe someday will will finally get this product and I know we would be very happy with our purchase."
2,Too messy,"I wanted a powder eye liner. I guess I should've known it was going to be messy. But I don't really use it because it gets all over my counter, but even worse all over my face. I like how it looks but at some point in the day it rubs off onto my face. I also wish that included was a little dish or something to mix the powder with water, I just use a small mirror. I am went back to using my liquid liner."
5,BEST ON THE MARKET,"Excellent on steaks, chicken, fish, roast, turkey, shrimp and burgers.Also in soups, stews and gumbo.I highly reccomend this to anyone who loves to cook and likes to get rave reviews on their meals.GOOD EATS,CG"
4,Biker Chick Jersey,"Size of jersey run small so buy a size up from your normal size. Like the jersy, very colorful and fits well even if it's a larger size then I normally wear."
3,Pretty But....,"O K ... if your strolling down your city bike path this bike bell will probably be just fine - Alerting the even slower bicyclist and pedestrians of your presence. I just found it: More Show than anything else. I can only say it is not on my bike and, ""Where did I put that thing?"""
4,Good Hat,"This hat is good, but it is on the smaller side. I wear a 7 1/4 to a 7 1/2 and I can barely get by with it. The hat will adjust to a larger size, but the bill is small and the depth (from above the ear to the top of the hat) is short. Overall, a good product, just check the size of your grape before purchasing."
4,Kinky in Wonderland,This is the 2nd book to the Wonderland series.This story is hot.Im glad that the King of Spades came out as the second story.
5,A w E s O m E ! ! !,"I love this song, It really makes you want to get up and dance. It's good for Tae-bo too if u are into that sorta thing :)"
1,cheap substitute,Product purchased From Pro MAx Commerce was not MSA model 817628 but (model 10102485) which was not listed on the MSA web site.The product did not match the photo shown. IT did not fit my face like the 817629 and had two paper thin layers with carbon granules loose inside.The MSA 817629 mask has six layers and the carbon is embedded in a felt like fabric. If you wore this mask with a small tear inside you could breathe the granules.This is another example of a vendor substituting cheap Chinese crap. Ron C
4,Under rated pleasure!,"I was almost scared off from reading this by other reviews. However, I did read it and enjoyed it. Finally, we see Takisian society and that other great space-faring society of which Jubal is a member. The character depictions were heartfelt and sincere. Dr. T is treated well this outing compared with the higher-rated previous novel. Everything wraps up nicely and we actually have a happy ending for one of my favorite characters-- Popinjay. This was a nice break from the bleak and depressing storyline that is developing back on Earth. I recommend this book."
1,Don't Buy It - Not Originals,These are almost all recreations of the originals. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
2,"It's Supposed to be ""I HAVE The Power!""","Okay. I respect the He-Man. You gotta give them that. But seriously, how can I entrust the sheathing of my ding-dong to people who don't even know their own material?It's ""I _HAVE_ The Power"", okay? Not ""got"". ""Have"".Plus, real He-Man undies would be made of fur anyway.Theo."
1,didn't get to use any,"Didn't get to use any because the espresso machine I got didn't work. So I assume it works, but I gave it a 1 because I really don't know."
4,Nice but....My Husband didn't love it...,"My Husband didn't love it... It looked great in the picture, he needed a ""sport"" watch, but it is a smaller and a bit lighter than expected. He likes big watches and we had to return it."
2,Not worth the money,"The item is way overpriced, I expected much more for a device that costs 3 to 4 times what the ""normal"" hot glue gun goes for. $99 vs. $4-$25All 3 of the glue packages shipped with the gun were LONG out of date. The ""use before"" dates were all from 12 to 18 months out of date.No where in the advertising was I made aware that the glue had a short shelf life of up to 90 days after it was removed from the package. No where did it state that the glue shelf life was only a year if left sealed. Normal hot glue stores for years.I use Titebond glue almost exclusively in my shop with outstanding results. I thought a product with their name on it would meet up to their nomally high standards."
2,"Repetitve, self-absorbed, unedited","The book is highly repetetive.The points above being Korean-American, body image, etc may be valid, but they are repeated ad nauseum. I kept expecting something different in the next chapter, but they're all the same.In the book, Ms. Cho discusses her dislike of being edited, and I assume this book was not edited. A good editor could have let Ms. Cho's thoughts and feelings come through but in a more coordinated and cohesive style, with less repetition.Even though she exposes herself mercilessly, I still come away from the book with the lack of a solid understanding of her, and especially where she is now."
2,Stick to Stand-up,"It's difficult to surmise that Margaret Cho, who's usually funny (at least when you watch only one of her shows, and only once, because repeating the experience is often tiring), can write such a boring, unfunny book that feels like Chicken Soup for the Sexually-liberal Korean Soul.Granted, some situations Cho describes ably, but she often winds up beating the humor into the ground, as with the incident when the producer grabbed her breast. Most of the book is annoying because of its italicized reflections and questions about the Self that are reminiscent of a diary of a teenage girl, but definitely not one of Cho's caliber.And that's too bad. Cho had the potential to hash out a really great book here. It's sad she didn't take advantage of that opportunity."
1,"Not very funny, sometimes tedious, but some sparks","I was not familiar with M. Cho, being an American living overseas for so long. So I thought that I would get acquainted with a different aspect of American culture and bring some laughs to my door-step. Though I found some passages funny and entertaining, her narration comes off as tedious and repetitive, infrequently humorous. Her tragic life seems dramatically sad, and Cho seems to want to bring laughter out of brashness and dismal situations. Congratulations for trying to pull herself out of so many self-defeating habits and for trying to find some humour there. I found her ""new-agey"" comments too superficial for interest. I good try, but the bleakness of her unhappy life is not salvaged by the humour, that seems too scarce for a notorious comedian. This is a review of her 4 CD audiobook."
1,Not worth the money,"When I ordered I was told it would arrive by a certain date. Never received another email and the date passed so I emailed the seller and requested the order be cancelled. I then received an email stating it was already sent and it was too late to cancel. Yet, based on the shipping information, it was shipped the same day as the email I received from them - a coincidence??? The bag is okay, but not as nice as a similar one I already have, and not worth the price. I would NOT recommend this seller either."
5,A Wonderful Guide To Understanding Life After Life,"I have re-read In Realms Beyond three times and I find new aspects of awakening each time. I have purchased copies for friends and they relate the same inner feelings of hopefulness and joy. In Realms Beyond is more than a retelling of one man's journey beyond death. It is a book of lessons to live by. But perhaps more importantly, it is a vivid picture of the promise of oneness that awaits us, now. This book is a must read for serious students who seek to realize their full potential as co-creative partners in healing self and bringing blessings to others."
3,Getting around Creative Professional products,"I mainly purchased this to go with my Creative Audigy ZS, that has a broken headphone monitor. The thing about this box is, you can hear all your inputs in real time, with minimum latency, well, a little from the optical. I use the optical out to go from the E-MU to the Creative Audigy, with guitars and mics. It's pretty straightforward, a little overpriced, and the unit will warm up."
2,"""Rubberized film"" rubs off quickly","I thought this item would be more ""rubbery"", which was fine. However, after using it for 2+ weeks, I noticed that the rubber film is slowly rubbing off! That's annoying."
2,Not a Useful Map,"This is a fold-out map laminated in sections. It is NOT a road map. It does show all the towns (even small ones) but if you want a driving map, look elsewhere."
5,"IT AINT NO BURGAR,BUT IT SURE IS GOOD!","ROCKIN'! This cd is sooooooo cool I luv all that and Ive been luvin all that since well 4eva! The best best song on here is defenatly the all that theme song that is sooo all that! It rocks and no one should hate it! Its also got people like Brandy, Immature and the late Aaliah."
2,For military enthusiasts only,"This book covers a critical period in British and European history, with fascinating, colorful historical figures as characters. Unfortunately, the prose is dry as toast and the characters -- arguably the most important figures in British history -- remain ciphers. Because there are no notes about sources, I can't even say if the history presented is accurate. When I saw on the inside cover that it had been reprinted by a military history press, I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach, and that feeling was borne out as I read the book. If you already know the difference between a centurion and a legionnaire, if you care deeply about military tactics and strategy, if character development isn't a top priority ... then you may like this. If, however, you are looking for good storytelling and life-like characterizations ... then don't bother.The definitive novel about Boudicca's revolt has yet to be written, I believe."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I already had a bit of knowledge about the new .NET framework, having attended a one day MS seminar and done some reading on my own. Based on the course description and the reviews, I got Dr. Meyer's course hoping for a deeper look at how it all worked.That information was probably there, though not in the depth that I expected. And with all due respect to Dr. Meyer, I found that his voice put me to sleep -- a remarkable monotone that fit perfectly with a very intelligent college-professor type, but was not at all conducive to presenting this material. I had to work extremely hard just to keep listening. It also seemed to move much too slowly for me -- with lots of repitition, including repeated plugs for the Eiffel language, one of Dr. Meyer's own creations. I found that quite distracting.On the other hand, the material is accurate and presented in a very organized, methodical way. Just didn't fit my learning style, I guess."
5,Great,"The book is of litle help, but the video is superb. Dr. Meyer is really a great comunicator and knows what he is talking about. The course isn't intended for those looking for technical details, but as an overall picture it is clear, complete and very enjoyable to follow."
4,Latin for office occasions...,"I leave this on my desk at work, and people think I'm some braniac that studies Latin...until they read some of the phrases within. Everyone that has flipped through it has enjoyed it. I'm still working on memorizing my favorite Latin insults."
5,Chamber Rock,"This Dream Called Life marks something of a departure from the sound, if not the spirit, of Steve Woodhams' earlier album, Lost Dog. It also chronicles an interesting musical evolution: to the gentle, introverted sounds of the first album, on This Dream Called Life, Woodhams has grafted some daring experiments in instrumentation and production, all of which results in an album that somehow walks a very fine line between sounding coherent as a whole and surprising the listener. I'm thinking, for example, of the transition between ""She's Gonna Change the World"" to ""Written In Water"" to ""Ordinary Special Day""--some of my favorite songs on the album. All these musical twists and turns nicely pick up on and complement Woodhams' lyrics, which, like the instrumentation on this album, are far from monotonous or maudlin and are replete with unannoying, thought-provoking ambivalence. I would strongly recommend this album--names like Crowded House and Aimee Mann spring to mind."
2,"GAME IN IT SELF, POOR",Did not have any problems with the product delivered to my home but with the game it self thought it would have been more.
1,My son liked it ok...,"It's Halo 2 and its the same game that came out years ago, now for ""WINDOWS VISTA ONLY"" on the PC. My 9 year old liked it but never played it much despite going nuts begging till I purchased it for him. He still plays Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 waaay more. Overall I was not personally impressed, I was bored in 5 mins."
1,Big Brother Strikes Again,"M$ (Big Brother) are pulling every trick they can to get us to buy Windows VISTA. HALO 2 is a prime example. You want to play the game? GET VISTA!!! Not likely! With so many people going back to XP from VISTA, this game is doomed from the off. Just take a few minutes to read the disastrous reviews for VISTA (all versions and upgrades), and you'll see just how bad the situation is. People are now actually demanding XP before buying new PC's and Laptops, so bad is the reputation of VISTA, and it's growing. Remember Windows ME? VISTA is 4x worse!What a disaster! I've been looking forward to this game for quite a while now, and if the graphics are anything to go by, nothing much has improved. If M$ want to alienate their loyal users, they sure are going the right way about it.If you're thinking of getting VISTA to run this, do yourself a favour and buy a console instead. It will cost you less in most cases, and you'll still have a PC that works properly.."
2,I wouldnt buy this,Microsoft should be ashamed. Players can boot the person who created the game and can cheat. Frustrating since I dont cheat in my games.
4,PC Version is underrated...,"When Halo 2 got released on PC it received a pretty negative reception. This was mainly because of the Vista requirements, and the fact you had to pay for the GFW Live Gold privileges.The graphics are pretty lame (What d'you expect from a port of a 2004 game?) and the system requirements are surprisingly steep, but once you get past that, this is still the same Halo 2 that was so much fun on the original Xbox. The controls have been ported decently; in fact playing with a mouse and keyboard is preferable to using the 360 controller.P.S. Microsoft's recently made the GFW Live service completetly free, so you don't have to pay for the additional multiplayer features as you did when Halo 2 Vista launched."
2,"Waste of time, money, all round terrible","First of all its really old, 2004 old. No upgrades that are noticeable.Instead of playing master chief the main character u play an alien in half the missions, U would think this was good except that they both play exactly the same way.It feels like u are still playing Halo 1 with this one.The Game's end is probably the crapiest I have ever seen. So stupid u will be puking ur guts out.Lastly there are not many new guns, the multiplayer is so-so, and the console is like a leftover of the XBOX. At some point u feel that its like Microsoft is doing u a favour by letting u play their game by paying them.DONT BUY THIS. IT IS TERRIBLE. A WASTE. A DIGITAL TRAVESTY.SAVE YOURSELF. ITS TOO LATE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME!!"
1,Does not work for Windows 7,"Microsoft didn't bother to release a patch for this game to work with Windows 7. Since I'd rather abuse myself with rusty objects than buy and install Windows Vista, it looks like I'm out $20."
5,It's Halo,"To me, this is my favorite halo. The campaign is littered with collectables that beg you to 'break' the game. The story is enjoyable to say the least. The multiplayer is immensely fun, and people still play online. How could anyone forget the super bounce?If you've missed playing halo 2 on the xbox I reccomend this purchase highly. It's rewardingly nostalgic and quite a lot of fun."
3,"Not bad, but a bad port overall.","While the game itself has achieved an iconic status for popularizing Xbox live back in 2004 this version is different, Halo 2 vista could have been a proper port like Halo CE but it was plagued with issues thus giving this game a lower rating."
5,so awsome if your computer runs fast,"this game is really fun even my friend loves it and he has an x box 360 with live, but i do warn you better have a fast computer"
1,Regular destops just won't do it.,"Wow. I am sorry, this game sucked. People with normal computers. Good luck.You seriously need a powerful computer to play this game.The requirement says nVidia 6000 cards or higher? You need a 8000 or higher.2Ghz processor? More like 2.7GHz.Windows Vista, not not so good.Direct X 10. GoodBut I sadly am disappointed in this game."
2,Good in a pinch,"I think this book would fit neatly in your pocket or purse, and then you could whip it out in need to consult it against a confusing local slang.Very dry reading though, very little explanation as to why some of the slang or stine is the way it is."
1,Yuck!,"Looks great - to bad you can't actually use it as a phone - crackling, and constant static! Too much trouble to return."
2,"cute, but lacks in sound quality","The neon lights and bubbler action are cool but has below average sound quality. Has no bass, treble or tone controls. Also, all the controls including opening the CD drawer and the volume control are on the remote only, not on the unit itself. So if the remote stops working the system would become non functional.It does have a nice retro style but if seems over priced for the features and sound quality that it has. UPDATE: the remote did stop working after only 2 days use. Would give it 0 stars if I could. COMPLETE JUNK! Crosley warranty states 90 days,you pay to send it back plus an additional $19.95 for return shipping and handling to send it back to you after they fix it."
1,"Holy train wreck, Batman!","Oh man, did EJ take a fall after 1976 or what? Blue Moves was a great album, but had too many filler songs and a depressing mood, A Single Man was just OK, not great but not bad, and then comes this total and complete piece of trash. Even EJ himself said that if he could go back, he'd take this one (and 1986's Leather Jackets) back. If it make you EJ fans feel any better, he said in an interview that he never intended to make a serious disco career, this album was just done for kicks as a (failed)experiment. EJ himself should see to it that all Victim of Love albums, 8-tracks, records, CDs, etc are all rounded up and destroyed. Then the world would be a better place, and I could rest easy knowing that Victim of Love will never hurt anyone ever again."
1,Disappointing!,"Nothing to do with his previous work, and nothing to do with what is expected of this great singer. Well, it looks like the great singers also make mistakes."
2,For completists only,This isn't really an Elton John album. So it has to be judged as what it is. Elton didn't write any of the music. So his only contribution are the vocals. The music is generic disco that comes nowhere close to what was heard from Donna Summer or the Bee Gees. There's not much good to say about it. The classic song Johnny B Goode is easily the best song here and its also the best produced song. There are no breaks between the songs which mostly just accentuates the sameness of this material. Pointless and uninspired.
4,Sounds familiar,"If Brian Setzer was back in a rockin' Rockabilly Band, this is it! I can groove to it, but not something I can listen to over and over again."
1,almost complete re-hash of previous Carnegie's great books.,"I am a big fan of dale Carnegie's books, but its disappointing that the publishers would like to cream the public their money by re-printing mostly the same stuff with different titles.""How to win friends and influence people"" and ""how to stop worrying and start living"" covers most of the content described in this book. i felt cheated when i bought and read this book. Looks like the publishers haven't read any of these 2 great books and gained some wisdom from them."
2,"Poor Rewrite of ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""","This is a re-write of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Stuart Levin, the CEO of Dale Carnegie and Associates, Inc. Unfortunately, the new book is an empty shell of the original -- it's already dated, although it was published in 1993, while the original, first published in the 1930's, is as fresh and as relevant as it was the day it was first printed. Recommend skipping this lesser imitation and sticking with the original."
1,music ?,Anyone that likes this group has missed the boat. Just a bunch of frog heads looking for someone to follow. Get a life instead of filling our prisons up.
3,Why is this style suddenly annoying?,"I just finished Blood's a Rover and thought it totally engaging. But I can't get two pages into Cold Six Thousand because of the staccato writing style -- the very style I found so compelling in the former novel. What's going on? Maybe it's the subject matter or maybe I'm just surfeited with short sentences, or maybe the sentences in Blood's a Rover are just better. Anyway, Cold Six Thousand feels like driving cross country with someone who slams on the brakes every 200 feet."
5,A masterpiece,"If one has chronologically (and as breathlessly as I have) followed the plots Ellroy has been weaving in (practically) all his novels, this book comes as a kind of apotheosis. At the peak of his art, Ellroy is a master of words, fiction (or should one say facts?), and of the English language,"
4,Good follow up,"The best book I have read in a long time, but definately not as good as American Tabloid. Wayne Sr and Junior float around the book never becoming anything more than what they were introduced as. In American Tabloid you were mesmorized by the evolution of the Pete and Kemper characters. Hopefully Ellroy is just setting us up for another insane story."
4,Not for the Faint of Heart,"JFK's assassins are revealed in this sequel to ""American Tabloid."" Plenty of sex, violence, salty language and racisim fill this tale where there are no good guys. Ellroy's trademark staccato prose reaches new crescendos--almost like a '50s beatnik rap. The Cold Six Thousand provides a glimpse of how things worked in the '60s, and Ellroy shows us why the US hasn't been the same since that turbulent era."
4,Tabloid Redux - but still essential,"Negative criticism first. Think 'Casino' following 'Goodfellas' - style/plot/execution all fine, but...dèja vu? TCST's interlinked trio lacks a leader in the vein of American Tabloid's Kemper Boyd, and the rocket-paced narrative loses dramatic weight as a result. That said, you will read the last 200 pages in a sitting, and the dénouement is Ellroy's best since 'The Black Dahlia'. Not a masterpiece as claimed in the sleevenotes, merely excellent."
1,Chapter 79,Early Ellroy was good. LA Quartet was great. Recent books overblown. New book sets new low. Real world charachters are cliches. Main characters are props. Women characters beyond props. People die. Contrivances flourish. Conspiracy theories propogate. Hate dialogue numbs reader. Reader wants more. Reader will try again. Better luck next time.
2,Ellroy let me down,"This is the 5th book of Ellroy I read. It was somewhat hard for me in the beginning because of the slang but I got used to it after my first Ellroy novel.I really do like his writing and let me say I am usually not a fan of Crime novels. However, as much as I liked American Tabloid, he is just overdoing it here. I was looking out desperately for a sentence of more than 4 words it really became too much in the end. This book could have been amazing, and Ellroy is the one to do it, but it just was not to be.A great writer of unique originality. Maybe better next time."
2,Not so good.,I've used these before and was happy but this batch is not as comfortable to shave with. These are good for someone with a light beard.
4,love Songs,"Being a fan of Michael Bolton's music its easy to like.After listening to his arrangment of love songs on the cd,the emotion of love came through. The arms of Love song ended all the songs on the cd nicely."
3,Don't stay sealed.,"They seem great at first! Really holds a lot and shrinks down to such a small package, but over time, the air crept back in and I had a huge bundle again."
5,This is a great book!,"I loved this book, it sweeps you along with it, you can just feel what the characters are feeling, its a great book. What makes it so special to me though, is that I am alot like muriam,(even down to her talent for dressmaking!) I can totaly relate to what she feels,and (relate to) how she has no friends in the begining. She is a very human charicter, no doubt I would have done just as she did in her shoes. The reason I say this is that one of the people that left a review of the book and panted a picture of her being selfish, caring only (mostly) for parties, fashions, ect. But I would think better of her, knowing what it feels like to be the kind of person she is. But, summing up, Elizabeth George Spear is a great author, and it is amazing to me that she made alot of this up!"
4,A Captivating story!,"This Historical Fiction Novel is great!! It helped me understand more about the time era. After the first few pages, I got really into the book. It made me feel as if I really were the main character, and going through her struggles. This book expresses the characters really well, and is fun to read!!"
2,Not really what I was looking for,"This book has some good recipes definitely, but it wasn't quite the kind of dessert cookbook I was looking for. It seemed a bit more fancy than what I'd expected."
5,"Aroma, gentle care and shine","TiGi Oatmeal & Honey is my favorite shampoo of all times. The conditioner is a perfect companion to the shampoo.Very gentle and caring effect, also for treated or dry hair, leaves hair soft and shiny without weighting it down. The honey aroma is almost addictive, I noticed I am always looking forward to it. Almost an aromatherapy session during your shower.The applicator is handy - just press the top, no hassle of opening the container. The big package lasts for ages, also using regularly on my mid-length hair."
3,ehh...its DiC...bleh,"I have only seen DiC dubbing, so i dont know what im missin with the original version. But i read the manga and its better. This doom tree thing is ok for a NA sailor moon lover...but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone who has seen any other version. Stick to subtitles. People that say sailor moon is a pointless show...have only seen DiC's version so thats understandable. Anyways, BISHOUJO SENSHI SAILOR MOON FOREVER!!! (and down with DiC!!)"
3,"Great Story, But Watch The Original Japanies Language One...","I don't hate dubs or subs, and I think Berua Vista Video has a good ideal about releasing a box set...but lets face it...this is the DiC english dubbing and choping of a great japanies anime. If you like kiddified anime, take a look. If your into anime which may be for kids, but dosen't speek down to them, then take a look at the original, if you can."
3,Sailor Moon,"Sailor Moon is what I refer to as ""A Starter Anime."" Perfect for the younglings... I also know a lot of older fans. :]"
3,It's an ok chopped DiCdub thang but i still love that pretty,"ok, ok, so it's not exactly the best dubbing but it's still sailor moon and silor moon anything kicks well you know any who this was a pretty good dubbing but not the best i still liked it though and i think that any one who is a truly devoted sailor moon fan should watch the video if ya'll already haven't i mean it's only been on tv for like a few years now so any who if you truly love sailor moon and even if you hate the dub, wich i don't hate i just wish they would be more cautious on what they do when they do it and any who like i said if you like sailor moon you should atleast give it a try!"
2,It was great while it lasted,"My son loved his Radio Flyer Trike when he got it. Scooted around all over the house. But, I noticed he outgrew it long before his friends had outgrown their plastic ride-ons (like the Little Tykes Push and Ride). Problem is the wheels start to get in the way of the feet--but that doesn't seem to happen on the Little Tykes design.Then, the neck of the thing started going loose and eventually hopelessly wobbly. Steering it was then impossible. I called Radio Flyer--they weren't much help for this problem and we eventually got rid of the scooter in a garage sale. We also had a choking hazard problem with Radio Flyer's push wagon -- several screws came off and I would find them and the washers strewn about the house. Regrettably, I have now pretty much sworn off the brand."
2,I wish I'd skipped this one.,"The size of this toy was too small for us.Maybe it was because our daughter was tall for her age, or maybe the sizing is just off. At ten months our daughter was big enough to sit on this flat-footed and push it around. At this age though, she never got the feel for it. She preferred pushing it around from the side or from the front, which were both awkward.By the time she got comfortable riding on it, the seat seemed too low and the entire process was equally awkward.Overall, I was happy with the quality of the toy. Word of caution though, the wheels smell horrible when first removed from the package. If giving this as a gift, I'd recommend letting them air out some ahead of time."
3,"Not interested now, hoping she will be later","I was so excited to give my 1 year old her first ""bike."" I spent 2 hours putting it together and set it out for her to play with in the morning. Unfortunately, the only thing she's interested in is the bell. She hasn't shown any interest in riding it, steering it or using it at all. Every time I put her on it, she climbs right off. I'm hoping that she'll want to use it more as time passes, especially since it's so cute."
2,doesn't turn!,"My son received this as a gift and my husband put it together according to the instructions, but the steering wheel does not move the wheel base. They move independently. Does anyone know the secret/or obvious fix for this? He says he followed the instructions and has put together many other toys. Radio Flyer customer service isn't open on the weekend."
4,Great Program,"I love this work-out DVD. It is so great. It is just what I was looking for on days it is raining outside or I want to change up my workout routine. I love the different levels all on one DVD. It is way more than just walking and a great workout. My only complaint is that the DVD comes in a cardboard sleeve and after just a few uses it started skipping. However, lucky it only skips on one section and hasn't gotten worse and is still usuable. The weighted balls it came with are hard to fill but they are still useable and a great alternative to expensive hand held weights. I recommend this workout to anyone looking to start a workout routine that can be done in the home, is fun, and a good workout but not extremely advanced."
4,walk away the pounds,"The video is great, not too difficult yet challenging, However, it is next to impossible to fill the weights with water. I cannot do it. It is frustrating and I wish someone would give me advice how to fill the weights because I find it impossible."
5,Walk Away the Pounds,Love it! I can walk at home without fighting off the neighbors dogs or dodging traffic!
1,Defective DVD,"Walk Away the Pounds-Complete In-Home Walking SystemThis DVD was defective, It stops, skips and the sound is muffled. I am unable to use it."
1,Disappointed,"I had ordered this DVD about 6 months ago and came on here to re-order it. But after reading reviews by people who had similar experiences as I did, I do not think I will. About 5 minutes into the 1 mile walk, the DVD just stopped. I thought that maybe it was the DVD play, but after trying it in a another one in the house, I realized that it was just a faulty disc. Unfortunately, I neglected to contact the company and am now out like $17 or however much it cost + shipping :-("
4,Great dvd!,This dvd has been a blessing for me! We live out in the desert and its so hot so you cant walk outside as of may. Also my husband and I have a 10 month old who keeps us very busy and I had been running low on energy. I do the one mile walk about 3 or 4x week and I have more energy on those days!
2,The box cover may be the bast part of this DVD,"The story line sounds good, but the film maker failed to pull it off. The film quality is poor, probably a home hand held camera. Even the sound was similar to the quality you would get from a 2004 hand held camcorder, monotone, with lots of echos.I think the film cast and crew used the making of the film to be able to write off the cost of their vacation to Contadora. I would recommend passing on the purchase of this one!"
3,Tastes like Ginger,"I couldn't find any details about how these products taste, so I just went ahead and bought a box of these from my local Grand Mart. This tastes like ginger. I'll have to use much less of that seasoning pouch next time...of which there are 5 pouches and it gets pretty messy."
4,Great series,This is a great disc and the title speaks for itself. It sets the mood for the end of the night party with the scotch sipping and cigar puffing atmosphere where good friends depart. It almost wants you to go back to the 20's when this music was the standard. Outstanding.
2,Cory Everson38 inch Mini Trampoline,Item advertised to ship with Workout Guide and chart but is not included. Amazon falsely advertising product.
2,very uncomfortable,It is very pretty looking and stylish but very unconfortable. it made blisters on my feet.
3,words falling on deaf ears,"I must admitt reading this book did have a sad and deppressing side to it. The book told of the last week of a abused five year old child's life.The book was overall a good book but not something that I enjoyed reading about.While reading this book I found myself asking why do people do these things to children or to anyone. I must addmitt that while reading I did happen to cry about two times just picturing what it would be like in her place, being surronded by people who hated me to the extend where they will hurt me as a child. I only have one commpaint, I hated the way the auther didn't discribe the house in which she lived. The auther left no immagination to the reader which is something that I usually look foward to when picking up a book. The book showed the true side of child abuse it wasn't sugar coated with ""Oh hunny I wouldn't do it again."" It was a very truthful look at what happens between closed doors and what can happen when children are left unnoticed."
4,My Review,"I bought these flip flops and I reslly like them, I cant wait until the spring and summer to wear them more. They take a little time to get adjusted to but after that they are a great product and I would recommend them."
2,disappointing,"looks beautiful out of the bag but it broke twice already and even though my beau fixed it both times, I am very leery of wearing outWill return this"
3,Disappointed,"I listened to this audiotape today in my car (it being Stephen King, I deliberately listened to it in broad daylight!) I didn't realize it was only one cassette till I opened the box, but no big deal. I loved the setting - live audience - and I think King got an extra charge from reading because it was live. I loved the story, the characters, the humor, etc. But the ending! ""That's it?"" I yelled at the car radio. Geesh, I wanted more!!!! Maybe if he does decide to publish the story he'll ""finish"" it. I'm glad I got a chance to listen to it, but I sure wouldn't recommend it to others. He left me wanting more."
2,Is Steven King Milking His Fans?,"I find that $... for a short story is a bit too much to pay considering that one could purchase ""Four Past Midnight"", which ran 763 pages and had 4 novellas in it, for $... when it came out. I also found the story line weak and pointless. After reading everything the man wrote, I feel that he is just shoveling it out to see what the public will take. Two stars is very generous for this book which isn't a book."
5,Poop scooper works great,"This Glexrake 33P Jaws Poop Scooper works so well, we bought a 2nd one for the front yard. Easy to work, and you can scoop with one hand on the handle."
1,"Too dull and the plastic is cheap, go razor blade scraper.",Plastic scraper just simply does't work. The plastic is soft and after minutes of use it's so dull it can be trashed. Use a razor blade.
5,Perfect,"Product was delivered 2 days after placing order. I installed it, replacing a cartridge filter, works like a dream, I couldn't be happier with it. Very prompt delivery, everything was in the box. Do your research and size your filter correctly, and you will have no problems. Saved me a bunch of cash and thats what I love about Amazon. Congrats to seller, I have nothing but positive views."
5,dont buy sand from home depot,.20 Silica Sand not the sand at home depot filled the filter with 200 LBS. of the sand. I pulged in the pump a lot of of sand blew into my pool. now its going all to the bottom of my pool. now im going to my pool store sand getting the .20 silica sand which is 11.49 unlike 5.97 at home depot ( and the sand at home depot is not .20 silica sand it is the sand for a sand box which is much to fine and will slip thought the pump fins ) The reson i gave this pump 5 stars because it was my user error. over all it work great after i got the right sand now the pool is cristal clear.
4,Sand filters are the best,"I worked in a pool store for 3 years and saw all the problems people had with cartridge or D.E. filters so the first thing I did with the pool that came with my house was get rid of the cartridge filter for this bad boy. It works great. I used to sell Hayward equipment so thats why I went with them, other brands may be just as good but I am not familiar with them. Easy to use, cheap to run, filters very well."
5,amazon saved the day,"my pool filter broke and my local pool supply was out of stock of the filter i wanted. amazon had a great price, shipped it overnight and i was back in in 24 hrs with a clean pool."
4,Super saving,"I have to say that I am very satisfied with my purchase. I did a little research and found that most local retail pool supply places wanted well over $300 for a similar though not necessarily equal quality product and I was able to purchase this filter for significantly less. I will say that my purchase was not without any hitch, the first filter was delivered without the head or other listed pieces (basically I got the barrel and base) but Amazon quickly sent me a replacement however the pressure gauge was never functioning. Aside from these issues this filter works fantastic and is much improved over my older original Hayward sand filter."
1,didn't like,I love Mexican v not like this product at all - did not taste good in the cookies or anything I added it to. Threw it away - found some Danncey Red Rooster vanilla which is delicious.
1,Horrible!,"This vanilla extract is horrible. There is no vanilla flavor whatsoever, and it is truly evil-tasting. I am glad I tasted it before using it in recipes. I could care less that it came from Sam's Club, but I am sorry I wasted ten dollars on something I am going to throw out. I have never written an online review of a product before, which gives some idea of just how bad this product is."
5,Works great,"This product works great, and is very inexspensive. Seen tremendous results in just about a couple of days. Highly reccomend,"
4,They work!,"These do whiten your teeth. Mine were whiter in the first 7 days of using these. I am not done with the entire pack yet, but I am pleased so far."
1,Worthless,"Spent forty-five bucks and I had to wear them thirty minutes twice a day for three weeks, burned my gums, and had extremely sensitive teeth for... no changes what-so-ever. Not even the slightest lightening, and I followed the rules to the letter. There's better ways to throw away fifty dollars."
5,straight ahead hot pickin,"For the traditional bluegrass and acoustic music fan, this cd is a delight. Clay's guitar picking is clear and imaginative without being ""over the top."" He lets the other musicians shine also -- the fiddle, mandolin, and banjo solos are outstanding also. As a fan and beginning clawhammer banjo player, I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of clawhammer solos on Black Mountain Rag and Mississippi Sawyer.All but one or two selections are instrumentals."
5,Outstanding!,"Another great recording by Pierre Boulez and the Chicago Symphony! Compared with my other favorite recording of Also Sprach Zarathustra (Previn in Vienna on Telarc) which is astronomical in proportion, Boulez's rendition, by contrast, is earthy and gritty. The Chicago Symphony captures the sounds of the Dawn of Man as if from the sludge. The opening sunburst is not overdone - with the result that there is less of a disconnect between the impressive explosion at the beginning and the lyricism of what follows. Boulez's controlled approach with the opening allows the climaxes throughout the remainder of the piece to become all the more important and satisfactory. The sound is immediate and the Chicago Symphony sounds like a million. The addition of Mahler's Totenfeier (opening to the 2nd Symphony ""Resurrection"") makes an excellent companion. A great disc whether you're a fan of Strauss, Mahler or both. An outstanding showcase!"
5,Great album deep influence from S. Burroughs Western Lands,"A very exotic music and narrative journey into the misterious Islamic eresy of the Hashisheen. One of the most interesting works by Bill Laswell about narratives, poems and legends inspired music. The contributions by various artists reveal a interesting common ground of thinking between them. Finally the influence of S. Burroughs book ""Western Lands"" is clear."
5,the absolute best,this is amazing stuff for tender sore noses inside and out. It relieves the dryness inside and the soreness outside better than anything ever tried. My last tube lasted 10 years or so and sometime the company changed hands so it is no longer available in stores. YOu will not regret buying. I just got three tubes for stocking stuffers.
5,I Was There,"I was in the arena as this event took place. It was awesome, and the tape captures the excitement well. The only thing that I didn't get from being there was the king and JR describing the action, and the situation with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Once I viewed the tape I understood the events I witnessed much better. Check this tape out."
2,Annoying and unrealistic,"In the latest Faith Fairchild adventure, her home is robbed along with several others in the area, including one where an old woman died. Faith spends the entire story obsessing over her lost treasures and trying to get them back. Her job and family take a back seat. While having a home robbed is not pleasant, at least no one was hurt. I felt like telling her to get over it already. This book lacks the cozy feeling the others in the series have, and the ending is not satisfying because no motive is presented. This was a disappointment."
2,The Body in the Bookcase,"I'm about half-way through this book and I am very disappointed. First of all the title is misleading. The body is not in the bookcase, only the head is, sort of. The head is on the bottom shelf with the body on its side tied to a chair. There also is a lot of unnecessary information and people in the book. The characters are two dimensional and I got no feeling of suspense, thrill, or am I even interested in ""who-done-it"". I don't think it's a ""who-done-it"" plot.I'm left to wonder if The Body in the Fjord is really in the Fjord or just has a hand trailing in the frigid water. Try, try again, but read some more mysteries, do, Ms. Katherine Hall Page. p.s. the british authors are the best!"
2,Not a big fan,"While these handing folders are a really good idea, they are a bit too stiff and don't seem to hang well in any file cabinet or holder in which I tried them. They were always too bulky and didn't fit on the rods well. If someone were going to use these with a really deep cabinet that had a lot of bottom clearance, they would probably work out fine. However, for the average letter size file cabinet or travel file carrier, these are a bit more pain then they are worth. I would probably stick with traditionally sized file folders. Again, the 2 inch expansion would be great, but the expansion seemed to elongate the file folder to be too tall to fit comfortable and securely in place. Will definitely pass on these in the future."
2,"Yikes, I wish I was dead!!!","Well, i must say I was extremely disappointed in this book! When The reviews cited the similarities to Pulp Fiction, I thought we had a winner. It was dark and it jumped around, but that's where the similarities ended.. The character development went every way you the reader would have hoped they wouldn't. As for the ending, horrible, which is surprising due to the final chapter being written by McCourt, who's 2 previous efforts I enjoyed very much. The off the wall and often unbelievable twist and and turns left me very unsatisfied. I felt like my intelligence was questioned. McCourt, stick with the memoirs..."
4,Second best X album,"This is a good album, not as good as ""at the speed of life"" but still above average, his lyrics stand out above any other westcoast rapper. Definetely a must buy. There are nice tracks on this album like ""what you see is what you get"" and ""Los Angeles Times."" will have your head bangin. A nice addition to anyones' collection."
4,tight cd but RESTLESS was a alittle bit beta,"i got the cd a couple of weaks ago n i was excited to get it cuz it was the last cd i needed to have all the xzibit cds. the first 6 songs r bangin (STRAIGHT FIRE, especially CHAMBER MUSIC) but then the songs get wack till track # 12, 13 is ok n then 16. the lyrics r good its just that i wasnt feelin the beatz. but u should still go out n cop the cd."
1,This must be a spoof,"If any of this book is true, you will do everything to prolong your life. What this book describes can only be one person's version of Hell."
3,Not as Good as the First One!!!!!,"I don't like the this dvd as well as the first one. First, Bob doesn't do a lot of the workouts and he was my major motivator. Second, I don't like Kim, I find her very annoying and don't really like the workouts she does. I would rather get verbally beaten by Jillian than listen to her voice. Third, I don't think it's as challenging as the first dvd either. Don't get me wrong the workouts leave me dripping buckets of sweat, but I just don't think it's as fun. I can't wait to blast through this 6 weeks (that's the time frame that I'm using the dvd) and move on to Bob's Boot Camp and Yoga workouts, so I can get my motivator back!!!"
3,Ridiculous,"This video is a little ridiculous. First, I have only done the men's portion of the weight training, but the only word to describe it is ""ridiculous"". First - the supporting cast are all over the place, not consistent and not always safe with their movements. Bob also commented to grab heavy dumb bells, but the moves are a mix of aerobic and weight training moves - so moderate weight dumb bells might be a better choice. The cardio work was alright, but not really the kind of work I would like to do. I have all of the other Biggest Loser DVDs except ""Boot Camp"", so had high hopes about this one - it failed in my eyes. The good points are that you can completely customize your workout easily... otherwise - I will probably not use this tape very often."
2,"Not enough specific, somewhat outdated","If your knowledge in electronics and avionics is very little and you look for an easy introduction this book is for you. But if you are an engineer and you are looking for a specific reference, this book is definitively NOT for you. Of 400 pages, almost 300 cover general subjects in electronics, and only 100 are specifically about high level avionics. It includes new standards such as ARINC629, but still describes very old devices and techniques no longer used in commercial airliners."
5,"Correlli's Concerti grossi, op. 6","As a person with a passion for music, especially classical, this CD is one the prettiest and the best."
5,Excellent fountain pen fornthe price,I have had a Rotring 600 fountain for many years and it is my favorite for actual writing among my assortment of pens. Those are hard to find now at a reasonable rate and so I gave this Initial version a shot. It answered my hopes very well. It writes beautifully if a little wet -- I'd suggest higher quality paper -- but that said it's a fine pen. The shape is a bit nouveau for my taste but once posted it is very comfortable..
1,Bad DVD transfer,"This DVD is made from a VHS transfer, so apart from the poor quality of picture, the sound is very bad. The subtitles are a bit helpful, but as the color is white, often they are invisible on white background. There are several times when the VHS tape, from which the transfer is made, is not smooth, so there are white horizontal lines running on the screen. These faults make this disappointing movie worse. I have no idea what the director/writer had in mind for this project, but the story doesn't work at all. It's about an ageing writer, lives in exile in Mexico, who finds again in a visiting young model, the love he had 30 years ago. ""You annoy everyone with your balloons"", says Marianne Denicourt. She is right. When the story fails, sometimes the art helps; but sadly it's Bernard-Henri Lévy instead of Luchino Visconti."
1,Embarrassingly bad (and bad-looking) late career Alain Delon stinker!,"Another late career Alain Delon title to avoid! The transfer onto DVD is very poor, with uneven lighting, bizarre casting (Lauren Bacall as an American who speaks unaccented, finishing school French!), and a very scruffy, unattractive looking Alain Delon. There is a convoluted plot involving an aspiring model and her manager who come to a Mexican island, and she hooks up with Delon, and receives unlistened-to advice from Bacall. There is gratuitous nudity (mainly the two younger women in the film) including a strangely shot love scene between the model and Delon. Very talky, and ultimately forgettable. Oh yeah - did I mention Delon's character has a hot air balloon on his roof? Do you care? This would NOT be recommended for inclusion in an Alain Delon film festival!! Save your money!!"
2,Well Researched but Poorly Written,"I must agree with previous reviewer comments. This book attempts to describe the Directorate of Science and Technology, yet it focuses on the bureaucracy of upper management and has little discussion regarding the programs and technologies created by the DS&T. This organization has played a cricial role in shaping modern history, yet the book is dull and uninteresting to read."
4,"Good Description of the Psychologist's ""Shadow""","Driven by my curiosity to learn more about the psychologist's idea of the human shadow, I purchased this book and read it easily. It is not technical, but it is very profound and deep. Based upon other reading I have done, it provides a good, basic description of the ""shadow"" concept.This work does not follow a rational progression of thought. Instead, it strikes a chord of common humanity deep within the heart of the reader. It promotes inward reflection and self-evaluation.I would only recommend this book to other Christian leaders who want to learn more about the psychologist's concept of the shadow. As a non-Christian work, it offers no lasting solutions to the human dilemma. It provides only a greater understanding of and sympathy for that dilemma."
5,Essential for the Kilt Wearer,"If you have never worn the kilt, you shouldn't even think about wearing one--let alone buying one--unless you've read this book. Even if you have a kilt, you ought to get this entertaining and informative treatise on all things kilt related. Thompson wrote this light-hearted and fun little text years ago, and yet he is still quoted as an authority.If you don't have a copy, buy one today. It's fun, it's a pleasant read, and you'll not be wondering about Scottish attire any more.I've read this book many times over the years, and I still find it interesting."
5,A wonderful page turner,"I have just started this novel after hearing Ms. Trigiana speak at the bookstore where I work. She was a very delightful woman, I was thoroughly entertained from the moment she stepped into the store until the moment she left. From what I have read so far, I love it.. I really can't put it down, she really has touched on ""small town"" life and captured the realism of it. I recommend this book to anyone, it really is a attention grabber. I can't wait to see the movie! Again Ms. Trigiana thanks for visiting us at the Little Professor!"
3,Nice Enough Story,I enjoyed this story and I found the characters to be very likable. I only gave it 3 out of 5 stars because there really wasn't anything too exciting in this story. Although I love happy endings I did find this book to be a little bit too predictable.
3,Easy to read but not that great of a story,I had no trouble getting through this book. It kept my interest well enough for me to read it quickly for my book club. I wasn't that impressed with the author's simple writing style and most of the characters were not very well developed in my opinion.
5,Lost myself in Big Stone Gap,"Lovely reading experience. I found myself up until 2:00 am finishing this book. And then reread my favorite parts so I could prolong the experience. Has all the best qualities of a legendary book. The secondary characters were so real you found yourself wondering how it all ended for them. If they all got what they deserved and longed for. I laughed out loud, I cheered the outcome..This is real life the way it should be. I am always a sucker for happy endings. Greatly recommended. READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad you did."
2,Well.. Alright,"Homespun is not my genre. I know, I know, I'm a book snob, and there's clearly more to this book than down home tales, but I simply didn't get along that well with it. It's cliched to say to the author, ""It's not you; it's me,"" but actually that sums it up quite well. There's nothing inherently wrong with Trigiani's style, but it's just not something that blows up my skirt. Not that I really want my skirt blown up, but you get the picture. Or, actually I hope you *don't* get that picture, but the general idea. OH, forget it.I think those who enjoy writers like Fannie Flagg would like _Big Stone Gap_. All well and good if that is your sort of book, and don't let me deter you.This isn't a bad book, it truly isn't, and it even does have wonderful characters with hearts of gold. It's just not my personal cup of tea. I would sell it at Amazon, but frankly I don't want to compete with the penny sellers. So, swing by my local library's next book sale and you can pick up my copy for a buck."
2,Fun but.......,"Big Stone Gap was a fun read and I did enjoy the characters that had a little substance to them. My big problem was with the portrayal, or lack thereof, of Jack Mac. He was a miner who was in love with Ave Maria, sold his truck to unite his love with her Italian family, and other than that the reader learned little about him. What did he and Ave have in common? After the trip to Italy what would they talk about at the end of the day? Where did this ""romance"" come from? I never felt that I knew Jack Mac, unlike Theodore, Pearl, Iva Lou, Fleeta and even Ave's lawyer. But as I said in my opening sentence, a fun read, of sorts."
4,Wonderfully depicted small town life,"I enjoyed very much reading about Ms. Trigiani's small town life in Big Stone Gap, VA. Being from Wise County's neighbor, Dickenson County (Virginia's Baby), I found it very intriguing that someone would write so eloquently about our so-called ""depressed"" area. I would encourage anyone to visit Wise County and find out for themselves if this isn't one of the loveliest places God made. I found Ave Maria to be a strong-willed person who always tried to keep everyone happy. It's no wonder she couldn't decide what she wanted in life because she was too busy aiding the community and her parents. Her father (who really wasn't) made her feel like she didn't belong.I wound recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about ""real"" human nature. There is no glamour or hype, just real people."
1,Disappointing,"After seeing a number of positive reviews on this book, my book group decided to make it our next selection. While we weren't looking for anything too deep, it was the concensus of the group that there wasn't much substance to the book at all. The book does have some quirky characters, Ave Marie leading the list, but most of their actions are improbable and sometimes didn't make sense at all. Although the visit by Elizabeth Taylor to Big Stone Gap was enjoyable, it was almost as if the author wrote an entire book around this one situation that probably occurred in her own life and left an indelible mark on her memory. Our overall consensus was that there are many more better books in this genre for your reading pleasure."
1,Not Helpful Whatsoever,"If you are a serious collector or professional dealer such as myself, I strongly caution you to avoid this book as it is an entirely worthless reference.If you are looking for a cute book to have on your coffee table, this book should do. If, however, you are looking for instruction and relevant information on identification, value and collectibility - you will find none in this utterly useless book. The author is a nitwit, and her values are a joke."
5,A Gripe!,"Out of print? You guys should be ashamed of yourselves! This book is one of the better ones on the market. You are all sentanced to 20 lashes immediatly! Then go out and shot yourselves for good mesure... Out of print! Humph!...Regretfully, Shawn W. Ooten"
5,Best of the blues,"I was very pleased with this compilation of blues music. Nice selection of artists and choices of their songs. I have this on my Kindle's speed dial. I listen to it quite a lot.Again, nice job Amazon.Thank you."
3,Do I have to have a title? The CD doesn't...,"Ok, this compilation business is really getting out of hand: this CD has only been out about 3 months and when I got it I found out I already had 3 or 4 of the cuts on other CD's! And, yes, some of the tracks are cut off (though they do it rather smoothly).But the music's still good if you go in for this sort of trance/house stuff, though I would slightly recommend getting Trancemission 2 before Plastic 5 (both have the excellent Jan Johnston song - I can play it all day long...).Basically Nettwerk has kept more or less true to form in this series of compilations. 3 1/2 stars -- maybe 4 (or more) if things hadn't been lopped off and the music was a bit more on the exclusive side. Are you listening Nettwerk?"
2,"Meh, a cloth is easier","This thing is not very good for its intended purpose. I'd imagine it would be great if you used it on your fans every couple of days, but if you're not one of the dozen people who are going to do that, it's useless. It will take some of the worst dust off, but if you've let your fan go for a few weeks or more, you're still going to have to follow up with a cloth and some spray."
4,Works well,"Does what the product describes, it cleans ceiling fans. Not that this is a fun chore, but it does a decent job. The handle is a little flimsy so just be careful with it. Have a vacuum ready to clean off the bristles before moving on to your next fan. Good product and nice Amazon price."
2,zzzzzzzz,"This book, in my opinion, was an uninteresting, overly-wordy read. I'm sure the same culturally-educational information can be found in a better-written, more compelling literary work."
2,my opinion,same bus as before but the silver was way better so get the silver bus. its not that durable u jus got to make sureyou dont break it.
1,Do Not Buy This Bus!,"The Bratz Tour Bus is so cheaply made, that my girls have played with it once since they got it for Christmas, and that was on Christmas Day. The roof keeps popping off and hanging by a string. After a while, it became so frustrating to them that they simply gave up. They could have sold that toy for $20.00,and still made a profit because I bet they spent $5.00 producing it! Don't waste your money."
3,messy looking.,"this football arrived super quick and is just what my little bro asked for this christmas. i was initially impressed with the ball but upon further inspection it looks very sloppily assembled, there is white bonding-like material just dripping down from where it should have been NEATLY applied along the center of the ball. it won't come off and i'm slightly embarrased to give this as a gift but hoping it will be overlooked since there's not enough time to return it by christmas. otherwise it looks functional and something my brother will enjoy."
5,"These ""Railroad"" Songs Are Certain To Provide Pleasure And...",""".....It is only natural that the various facets of railroad life would have been captured in folk song.In this collection, I have gathered together a cross section of these songs;some humorous, some romantic, some nostalgic, and some dramatic and narrative.Doubtless, many of them will bring to mind, past experiences of your own.In any case,THESE ""RAILROAD"" SONGS ARE CERTAIN TO PROVIDE PLEASURE AND ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.....""[from the book of introduction by Jay Arnold]"
3,Scholarship diminished by poor format,"This commentary possesses much good information. It is exigetical and interesting, and is of great help to the student of the Bible. The single flaw in it, however, is the format. This commentary uses much parenthetical notation, sometimes lasting for several lines. This makes for difficult reading. One does not know where the commentary ends and the notation begins. In addition, the reader is forced to hop from parenthetical notes to footnotes and back again. The format makes reading difficult, but the content is excellent."
2,Auto-Focus is unpredictable with this,"I have had this teleconverter for several years. It does work, however as others have mentioned, autofocus is troublesome. Every auto-focus lens I have tried will endlessly hunt if your in medium to low light situation and you ultimately have to manually focus. Previous reviews have explained ""why"" it happens, however it also slows down an otherwise fast autofocus lens in bright daylight which limits its use. One thing I did notice is if you get everything just ""right"" the images still are not as sharp.I would recommend using a different name-brand teleconverter."
4,Ok Knife,"I do love the knife but mostly because it has something to do with Rachel Ray. I saw Henkles Knives being sold at Cosco (a pack of them) for what I paid for this Rachel Ray knife. But I had a gift certificate so I feel that I didn't pay for it. Personally it's an average knife, I feel so unless your a Rachel Ray fanatic, I would buy a Henkles knife or a good named knife."
2,"After a Year, Disappointed...","I was initially excited about the Furi Rachael Ray Coppertail 7-inch East/West Santoku knife. It fit well in my smallish hand, the balance was good, and it sliced expertly. Now, 14 months later,despite good care, the knife edge is easily dulled and nicked, and the blade is more susceptible to rusting than any other knife I own. My Henkels knives have never behaved this way. The Furi is a poor investment in my opinion."
5,MMMMMMMelts In Your Mouth,"Man, these Milka Aero bars are the end all of chocolate. Their light airy composition allow for a great new twist on the classic Milka chocolate. The only let down is that Amazon does not sell the mint version of this little slice of heaven."
2,Reprint of a book from the 70s,"This book is a reprint of a novel published in the seventies -- it shows its age, and probably wasn't all that good back then, either. The action is implausible, often silly. The characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, and the conversation is dull. If nothing else, it shows how far the thriller genre has progressed -- compare with Robert Brace's BLACK TIGER, for example, where the plot line is believable and the characters genuinely engaging, even minor ones."
4,Clive Cussler never ceases to amaze me!,"This is classic Cussler at it's best. The hero, the girl, and the bad guy......what more is there? To my fellow Cussler fans, I have read ALL of them now, and I'm looking for an author that is very similar in style and content. If you can E-mail me some names, I'll order them right a way!"
3,Dirk Pitt - Man of Action (and fashion sense).,"I started reading Cussler beginning with ""Atlantis Found"" and I have gone back to the begining and have been reading the earlier Pitt novels. I would say ""Iceberg"" is better than ""Pacific Vortex"" and on par with the ""The Mediteranean Caper."" It interesting reading (or watching)the characters who are so well developed in ""Inca Gold,"" ""Atlantis Found,"" and ""Valhalla Rising"" develop. I was disappointed in the absence of Al in this story, kind of like Holmes without Dr. Watson. Pick this book up if you haven't read it and have read others in the series, but I would start off with ""Inca Gold"" or ""Flood Tide"" if you haven't read a Pitt adventure before. The later novels in the series feature strong female characters, however, the female character(s) in this one are just window dressing. It is important for the unread Dirk Pitt reader to know that Cussler has learned to write female chraracters much better at time has gone on."
2,Do not read this one as your first Dirk Pitt,"Up front. This series of books is great. It's the closest thing we have these days to a true Indiana Jones-like adventure with a little 007 thrown in. Fun stuff and Dirk Pitt is just plain cool.That being said on with the review of this book....This book is VERY dated and it shows.Very sexist. Very homophobic.Cussler's books should never be taken as anything but, entertainment so we can't blast them too much.This is early on in Clive's writing career so the dialogue andsome of the scenes are lacking.However, there are parts were you'll see the character and the writer showing glimpses of where they will be someday. The action throughout the book is awesome although what Pitt wearsnear the end to observe and later fight the enemy was a bit much.The shocker ending was a little strange as well. I don't want to put this down too much and give the wrong impression of the series.So, take a big Cussler fan's advice and read this one later than the others."
3,VERY minimalistic,Just as the title suggests this is a POCKET Catechism. Both small in physical size and content. Not suitable for study but good for quick reference.
1,Not What I Thought,"Don't confuse this album with the National Park Series. There is no music, only the sound of the Cape Cod surf. It's fine if all you want is ""white noise"". I guess I didn't read the description carefully."
4,inspirational,thia ia gospel CD. I wish it was labeled that before I purchased it. I love this CD but I don't want it. I think I will give it to my AUnt. It is great I live Howard Hewitt. It is a good collection piece.
5,Nice,"very well made, glows bright for a long time after dark. Very impressed. I would reccommend this product, and would buy again."
1,not compatible with cybershot T30,"This battery does NOT work with my sony cybershot t30, thus the product title is misleading! The camera says ""infolithium only"" and shuts down. I recommend buying the [more expensive] sony infolithium battery."
4,a good resource,Not too much different from the 2006 edition but still a great resource for artists and designers looking to sell their work. I found quite a few companies to send my samples to and got a response. Probably not necessary to buy the new version every year though.
3,Halle Berry pre-2003,"This short book on Halle Berry through her marriage to Eric Benet was usefulfor filling in the gaps about her early years before making it in Hollywood.While the revelations provided by her first love and classmates were insightful,most of the bulk of the information came from magazine articles and would have beenpreviously known by her fans. The images of Berry as a teen included in the book werevery nice as they were rare, but the others of her as a celeb were basicallyalready known."
4,Good stuff midway through,Both discs are excellent and really get going at about track 6. I've been waiting for a release from Tiga (like many people). And this double disc definatly doesn't disappoint. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Ajax cd. Not knowing much about this DJ I was in for a surprise.
4,Something for everybody.,"I love these anthologies! There's something for everybody in MALICE DOMESTIC 9, this collected homage to Agatha Christie. Some of the stories are based on Christie's plots, some on her characters, and some just contain references to her works. Of the 14 stories, a couple are dark, some are outright hilarious, and almost all are in the cozy tradition. Besides Christie's own ""The Case of the Discontented Soldier,"" there are stories by Robert Barnard, Jan Burke, Kate Charles, Marjorie Eccles, Teri Holbrook, Gwen Moffat, Marcia Talley, Dorothy Cannell, Charles Todd, Ann Granger, Walter Satterthwait, Carolyn Wheat, and Susan Moody. (There is no story by Joan Hess -- just a tiny introduction.) This is a really fine collection. I've read some of these first-rate stories several times already. These anthologies are an excellent investment!"
5,Ease of Use,"This door handle was easy to install. The old handle had broken, so we couldn't get in! Product was just as described."
5,YOU CAME HERE BLAZING T&T!!!,"This single had been sitting at the record store for quite a while before I finally bought it. I was pleasantly surprised when I played the cassette at home. The LP Version is hot! But the ""EDDIE'S R&B SMASH MIX"" is a cool dance-pop song with embellished vocals that makes it even hotter. I only wish that the cassette\cd5 single had the ultra hot instrimenatal , house and techno mixes. Other from that it is excellent."
3,adequate,"Umbrella is a nice shade of Terracotta, as advertised. Wood spines are a bit small and one had a part of the spline splintered out which I needed to glue back together. Operation is simple and works fine."
5,Perfect bag for going light,"No one bag serves every purpose, but this one is perfect for what I wanted. It holds my Pentax K-x with 50-200 lens attached to the body with room enough to throw in either the 18-55 kit lens or other accessory of about that size. Front pocket holds small, thin items like lens cap, filter, remote, etc. This bag hangs very comfortably and is very inconspicuous which is exactly what I needed. Very simple design but very practical and I love the green. I am ordering another larger Domke for those times when I want to carry a little more, but these bags are my favorite of all the camera bags I have owned. This bag does not have the excess padding of the other brands, but I am very careful with my gear and wanted something more slim-lined and this suits the bill."
4,"Nice Bag, Could Have Been Even Better","Don't get me wrong -- this is a durable, high quality bag with lots of nice features. But it would have been great for there to have been a little zippered mesh pocket somewhere to securely hold memory cards, batteries, filters and all the other little doo-dads that seem to accompany photographers everywhere. As it is, the best (really the only) place to put them is in the long side pocket next to the main compartment, where they will all loosely roll around together.In terms of size, the bag suits my needs -- but I've only got the micro four-thirds Lumix G1 and two lenses -- some may find it a bit tight for a full size DSLR.As another reviewer mentioned, the velcro on the front of the bag is extremely loud."
4,Too big for Micro Four Thirds,"If you are looking for a rangefinder style bag for your micro four thirds camera and three lenses this one is a bit too big. E.g. E-pl1, 17mm lens, 9-18mm lens and 40-150mm lens. It is too tall for a micro four thirds rangefinder style cameras which fall to the bottom of the bag and have to be fished around for. It would however be perfect for a Leica M4 size rangefinders and longish manual lenses.Also, when open the zippered top doesn't open enough to allow things to go in and out easily.As others have said, the velco on the front is too noisy.Construction and materials are superb though.Tedolph"
4,Perfect for camera + long lens,"I shoot with an Olympus E-P1 which is a digital camera with the specs of a DSLR but with out the prism and mirror, so it is a little smaller. This with either a 40mm-105mm or 14mm-42mm lens mounted on it fits in the bag with enough room for the other lens in a divided space plus filters for both.There isn't much room left except for a booklet or strap. The shoulder strap has rubber woven into one side of it so that it does not slip off of you shoulder. Very well made, great padding, and water resistant. It will probably last a life time."
2,BEWARE,"The watch is fine, but it arrived with no instruction booklet and it barely fit my wrist-I have a small wrist. i have never bought a luxury watch that did not need links taken out of it in order to fit my wrist. My very strong suspicion is that they sold me a watch that had been previously returned and previously fitted to another customers wrist. I have sent Amazon a note. I will wait and see what happens"
5,Topps is still the best,"Topps baseball cards have been the most collectible ball cards since the late 50's. There are 32 teams in the MLB and each team has a 40 man ""active roster"" which comes to 1,280 ball players. This card set includes 661 of the most popular baseball players. If you can find these on sale I recommend getting two sets. One set for opening and enjoying each and every card and another set to keep sealed so the value later on is not diminished."
1,There is better big beat out there,"I was expecting ""Joey Kingpin"" and ""Fatboy Slim"" style big beat dance music when I bought this record. Unfortunately, the only good song is the one they play on the radio. I'm sticking with Joey Kingpin."
3,late....,"i just find it amusing how ive had this album for almost 3 years i think, got it during the big beat craze of 97-98 with fatboy slim, chem bros, propellerheads, crystal method, etc. and all of a sudden its the top seller cause of one song, which is all over even the pop airwaves and mtv. its a pretty mediocre cd when it comes down to it, only a few catchy tracks. i like the opening track with all the scratching, but alas the rest of the album isnt like this. the 4 minute version of ooh la lais much better than this one....this is one is too drawn out and unexciting. a trance song should be 7 or 8 minuts.....big beat tracks arent supposed to be subtle, they have to get to the point. my 2 cents. if you're into big beats and samples, fatboy slim's ""long way baby"" and propellerheads ""decksdrumsandrockandroll"" are much superior cds. dont forget crystal method's vegas for the best big beat cd ever. too bad tweekend kinda blows...."
3,Nearly fits,"This product appears somewhat more durable than the original GMC part. However, when using it on a 1996 GMC Suburban, I found that the Dorman replacement part will not fit completely flush in the handle indentation on the door. The part is slightly too thick and sticks out on the top left edge."
2,Poor Fit,"Works as it is supposed to, Just doesn't seal against door very good. It would get alot of water in over time."
4,Easy-to-read overview of behaviors,"For a book that costs about $14 and covers 52 behaviors in toddlers, you can't go wrong. For other behaviors you will encounter during your toddler's stage, you can extrapolate. I think Jana Murphy's choices are great, and the questions are nicely organized in logical chapters. While some readers criticize this book for being lightweight, I think that it's just the right amount of reading for those of us who have no time for reading anymore.What is also convenient about this book is that Jana Murphy gives you a little ""now that you know"" at the end of the behavior Q&A; and tips on how to handle potential problems. This is a practical little book with no frills, and I think the author accomplishes her goal.If you are looking for a ""deep"" toddler psychology or a textbook fit for a graduate seminar on toddlers, then you need to get Socioemotional Development in the Toddler Years: Transitions and Transformations (August 2007), a $55 tome that you can pore over."
4,Great book for a young history buff,"I read this book to my 6 year old who is interested in the Revolutionary war. It was hard to find a book to tell about this period of time that was fitting for a 6 year old child. He was on the edge of his seat though most of the story and begged me to read ""just one more page""It is written in journal form so you learn about the people he meets and everything that happens first hand. At the end it tells you what happened to each person from the story...the part my son found most interesting."
3,Disappointingly slow-paced!,"After having read all of the Dear America series, this selection was definitely a let-down. While the historical content was right on, it read too much like a history book and I found it hard to get through for pleasure reading. Wills' character was believable, however, and there were a few ""seat gripping"" incidents that helped me finish the book."
1,is this supposed to be about the war?,this book has almost nothing to do about the revolutionary war. it's just about a boy who works as a busboy at a tavern.when the book finishes and the war hasn't even started yet!! if you want a job as a busboy you should read this book otherwise skip it.
2,Read John WcWhorter's Review,"With one exception, it mentions everything that I would.The exception? The book is ATROCIOUSLY organized. The models chapter should not have been last, the chapters on the squid in folklore and literature and cinema should have been sequential (and after the chapter on anatomy and characteristics), and it has a lot of superfluous and useless information.The footnotes are the second worst that I have ever seen, as well. They are frequently useless details, sometimes they should be in the main text, and sometimes they are only incredibly tenuously connected to the text (if it weren't for the asterisk, they wouldn't be connected at all...)This was not a great book, even for people who love Archaeteuthos. Penguin should have done better.Harkius"
4,Intresting topic and excellent sources.,"This book is filled with wondering insights and info. on the elusive Giant Squid. Ellis's use of evidence from centuries back shows his devotion to the topic. Though, as is normal for Ellis, he overuses his footnotes and examples almost to the point of confusion in some parts. These footnotes would be much better used and more easily understood if they were organized into a seperate section or used as a reference not a paragraph written into the text. On the other hand I was not at all dissapointed with this book and have continued to buy other books by Ellis. I would suggest this book to anybody that studies anything of this sort or that is just intrested in it. GREAT BOOK!"
4,Gun Lake,I like how this book has many different aspects and characters and then winds them all together. Relationships fall together and fall apart in this book. Some parts are kind of gory but it tests faith and friendships and shows how people can move past things or stay stuck cuz of something that has happened in their life. I found I had to pay close attention to the characters as to who they were before they were all thrown together.
3,Sturdy but Heavy,"My husband really likes this step stool since it holds 250 lbs. However, I found it to be much too heavy for everyday use (I am 5 ft, 110 lbs). Also the surface of the steps are plastic and hard, but in the picture they look like they could be a squishy material. Overall seems like a good deal, but you better be strong."
2,Not as expected,"I wish I could return this, but it would be so much trouble to do so. The ladder is hard to set up initially, but once opened it is stable. The problem is that it is very heavy and much more clunky than I anticipated. I'm not sure what ""designer"" means in the name, but don't expect something very attractive. There were no instructions included with the ladder, so it took me a long time to figure out that there was a mechanism on the back that you had to push in order to get the ladder to collapse for storage. Finally, it came with numerous scratches on the legs and some connecting parts that look not exactly rusted, but not very 'new'.If you are looking for something you can use in the backyard or garage, then it may be fine. If you are looking for something that you want to use in an office (as I did for reaching high shelves) or home, don't be mislead by the designer name."
3,Great workout - bizzare Denise :-l,"It's amazing how someone who can't cue well or keep in time to the music, has sold so many dvds. I admit she knows her stuff and she is motivating, but she is annoying.The exercises in this workout are really good. I believe that if you do this a couple of times a week, you are going to see definate results. I just hope you can get past her uber enthusiasm. Sometimes she looks possessed.So turn down the sound and learn the moves so you can do this without the disc so you can get the benefit of a brilliant routine and workout, without the painful out of time 'instruction' from Denise."
1,Not impressed,"I was really hoping to enjoy this video I have been using Slim in Six for a while now when I dont go to t he gym. However first off Denise aggravated me with her facial expressions and annoying voice. Also i felt like there was no flow to this video! Everything was so jumpy and unorganized, I felt like if I continued I would pull something.Not impressed at all I will never use this video."
2,Denise Austin DVD,I was so excited when I ordered the DVD. I waited and received it no time. I like Denise Austin and the way she keeps u moving with her pace. There is nothing wrong with her workout but the only thing which bothers me is that the DVD is not functional in a sense that u can not go to other options so I am only using the first session and unable to use the rest of the workout session. Pls. be careful when ordering this as it only gives u 30 minutes of workout. Not recommended.
4,Grew up with Denise in my house,"I have been doing Denise workouts with my dad since who knows when, so I expected it to be challanging and it is. I had to give it 4 stars though b/c even after doing this DVD for a few months pretty regularly, I cannot keep track of what she's doing unless the volume is up. And when you first start, even with the volume up and paying attention to everything, she's hard to follow b/c she changes directions without mentioning it. But this is a very good work out, especially if you put all 3 segments together, and I feel it's worth the money."
3,Okay workout,"Not a big fan of Denise Austins workouts. She is very choppy when moving from one move to another, which makes it hard to follow, and I get easily frustrated because there are no cues that the move is changing. I was expecing something that used more kick boxing moves, which this has only a few punches, not enough to really call it kickboxing.All that aside, if you can follow Denise, its a good 20 minute workout that gets your heart pumping. After doing this workout for a month, I rarely do it now, in favor of others who give better cues that a new move is coming up."
1,No blast here,I am no beginner to workouts but the exercise moves are way too fast and can cause injury. Proven by how fast Denise must talk to keep up with herself. I tossed it in the trash!
2,Repeat,"I consider myself advanced when it comes to fitness. Although, I do like Denise Austin, this workout is no different from the others I have purchased or rented. Apparently, she only knows a few moves. I would recommend for someone starting out, but not for someone advanced."
1,Not recommended,"This cable simply did not work as the HDTV connection I'd hoped to use it for. I saw some reviews suggesting that the connectors could be switched around to work and I tried some different (mismatched) connections but didn't pursue it too far, worrying that I could damage one or both of the units I was trying to connect together. In any case you shouldn't have to guess at the ""correct connector color mismatch"" in order to get a cable like this to work."
3,wire colors switched insanely,"I ordered this for my Canon ES8200 camcorder, and thanks to all of you who pointed out that the wires are switched, otherwise I would have just thrown it away. It did not work the normal way, and neither did it work for me when only the red and yellow wires were exchanged, as one of the reviews suggested - but then I just thought that the guys in the factory(whatever they are smoking)could have gotten it wrong in other ways, too, so I tried several combinations (there are not that many, anyway, with only three wires and three holes + the right one is out in the first place), and this worked for my camcorder: Yellow wire into Red hole, Red wire into White hole, White wire into Yellow hole. I have it posted in the TV cabinet so I don't go crazy every time I need to connect the camcorder. Overall - nice job, ain't it, but I still gave it three stars as it worked eventually."
3,Wired funny,"it came in good condition, which is obviously important, but I have to plug the colors in funky to get it to work with my samsung galaxy phone. I never remember how it's messed up, I think two of the colors have to be swapped (red and yellow I think), it was odd that the video was coming through an audio wire. Not sure if it's this wire or the phone that's funky."
2,Doesn't work with Samsung Wave,"I thought it would work with my Samsung Wave but it doesnt. cable is ok, but doesnt work. waste of money if I return it."
1,"Don't buy for your Roku Streaming device, it doesn't work","I bought this thinking it's universal but it's not. I needed a new 3.5 millimeter jack to yellow red white and this didn't work. The red wire is the video wire because my tv did'nt show video but it shows that wavy thing going up and down instead of snow and in the picture was a very obscured and small looking thing that said ""amazon instant video"" and I have that on my roku menu, so red is video (even though all others were tried and nothing) but it will not work on Roku 2 XS. That sucks because a search for ""roku composite cable"" brings this product page up... =("
1,Waste of Money,"I tried all possible hook up combination's to get this cable to work and the best I could do was using the red plug for the video it would come in very poor, so bad that you could not even watch it. I tried it on several different pieces of equipment.As far as I'm concerned this cable is useless and a waste of money."
1,Does not work on ATNT captivate.,Switched the red and yellow and all that stuff. Tried three different tvs but only got audio. I guess it's hit or miss on this product.
2,Works.... sorta,"For a relatively cheap cable, it works. However, on my Samsung Captivate, I have to reverse the Red and Yellow cables. I expected that. The problem is in the build quality. The connector has a badly soldered/crimped cable inside the ""head"". I have to wiggle the cable around to get the video to show up properly. This is especially annoying considering this is for use in a car where screwing with something is a bad idea. I would not buy from them again."
3,Acceptable,"This CD is approximately 20 minutes long. It features about five interviews or press conferences with John, Paul and George. The main drawback of this CD is that the time and place of the interviews is not given. So one is left to guess the circumstances of what he is hearing.John discusses Christianity and the controversy over the ""bigger than Jesus"" flap. He makes it clear that he wasn't insulting the church or Jesus. And he was not praising the fact that a cultural phenomenon could be bigger than Jesus.On another occasion, Paul is asked if he was secretly married. He strongly refutes the notion.Seeing these interviews/press conferences on video tape or DVD would definitely be preferable. While this CD is not a required item for Beatles fans; it is, nevertheless, somewhat informative."
5,A beginner super hero's dream,"Our 3-year-old son was thrilled with this present (and it is hard to achieve with so many gifts and toys in his life), and I was pleased with its quality as well. I like the fact that the masks are made of fabric with lining, which makes them more comfortable and I suspect more durable than the cheap plastic I expected. The colors are nice and bright, and the complete outfits look just as pictured. The cape is a little long for my 3-year-old, but not unconfortably/dangerously so. His 13-year-old cousin played with him, and was able to wear the costume, too, so the age range is describe appropriately, too. Not of the least importance that the set takes VERY little space. I would recommend this product to any kid who loves role-playing and is into super heroes."
4,"gift to Grandsons, 3 and 5 yrs.","My son reports that the costumes look like they are well made and his sons, 3 and 5 yrs. are really enjoying them."
4,Fun for the price,It is nice to have 3 outfits in one box so my son could instantly play dress up with his friends. The little tabs that hold the capes on fell off but they are easy to repair. My son loves the batman mask and wears it a lot. THe robin mask is uncomfortable but the kids seem to tolerate it for short periods of time. It is nice to have easy to put on dress- up clothes that don't require other clothes to come off. I recommended it to a friend and she gets a lot of use out of these flimsy costumes too. Worth it.
4,Dress up review,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old son. He LOVES to dress up. He has had a blast with the costumes. I was a little disappointed that the ""trunk"" was actually the box the costumes came in, not an actual trunk that was sturdy enough to stand the test of time."
2,DC Comics Boys Trio,"Product did not include a a batman costume, two superman's and a robin. Low quality and I would not recommend this product."
4,GREAT VALUE!!!!,"I wanted to find a fun trunk of outfits for my two young boys to be able to play dress up with. It was suggested to me that I just stock up on Halloween costumes but it was out of season and they are expensive online. That's when I found this product. Yes, they are not full costumes (they are actually more like smocks that the child slips over their head and ties on the sides) but they are easy for my sons to put on and take off and they are easily washable. Also, because I knew my sons would likely destroy them fairly quickly I didn't want to spend a lot of money on more expensive costumes. All three have held up extremely well. The Batman and Robin masks are both too big (my boys are three and 20 months) but that doesn't bother them much. The bottom line is that they LOVE wearing capes and dressing up and I would buy this set again in a heartbeat! (One more note, the costumes don't come in a ""trunk,"" they come in a cardboard box.)"
4,3yr old son LOVES it,"My 3 yr old son absolutely loves this set. He plays with it for hours and has so much fun pretending to be the different characters. The outfits do not come with pants, so wouldn't be good for Halloween...but is great for every day pretend play. I can't wait to have his friends over and they can be Batman & Robin together."
3,Rip & Run,"Got this for our 4 yr old as a Christmas gift. He LOVES them, had to bribe him to take it off for bed. 5 days later we have had our first problem - the tie string ripped off the Batman cape. Velcro would have been a better choice for the tie straps. The only other problem we have had is the capes have developed runs in the fabric around the neck.DC Comics Boys Trio Action Set Dress Up Trunk"
4,Great product for boys!,My 3-year-old Godson loved this gift! He has two sisters who play dress up and was so happy to be able to join them.
4,If you like Jackie Collins You'll Love Sally!,"Sally uses the Washington Glamour and Intrigue the way Jackie uses California and Vegas to lure in the reader. Her descriptive writings put you there, and her style keeps you reading."
4,GREAT BOOK!,omg! i loved this book it was SO awesome! im SO happy that ty and amy are together i was waiting for that to happen for SO long! i am obsessed with this series and with horses! i cant WAIT to find out what happens later. i always count down the days till the next one comes out and now i cant wait ne longer!
5,Definately one of the BEST!,"I just got done reading this book, and like all of the others, it is very very good. I'm glad Amy and Ty are together (finally!). Its interesting because for the first time, Ty and Amy really aren't getting along. So Amy goes to a Native American for help. It was really cool how she learns to wait for the answers to come to her. It's a neat book to read because Amy isn't at Heartland for most of the book. I was glad to see that she and Ty work things out. I think they are a great couple. I can't wait for the next book to come out so I can see what happens with Amy, her father, and their new horse!"
3,"Almost the same book as ""Professional Palm OS programming""","Perhaps this was my bad planning but I purchased this book after having already purchased the ""Professional Palm OS programming"" book by the same author. Don't get me wrong, I assume any book by the same author will contain some of the same information but this book duplicated more than HALF of the same material from the other book. I was hoping to read something new to cover what the other book didn't but instead I found myself reading the same thing.Let this be a lesson to those who pay closer attention to what they purchase. This book is helpful but not any more helpful than the other book ""Professional Palm OS programming"". I guess I'll just have to use the Palm example programs to learn the remainder of what I need to know.Maybe I'll write my own book some day. Yeah.. I guess that might not happen any time soon (or until I take a class in school or something)."
5,Dancer Laura,I love this DVD; as usual Denise is an energetic teacher constantly cuing you on when and how to move. Make sure to view the entire program before practicing since there are numerous dance routines. I highly recommend this DVD.
3,Denise needs to give more directions,"This is definitely for someone who has NOT been exercising. The dances are relatively easy except the ballet sculpting. I found Denise a little annoying and she didn't really give good directions before changing directions or counting steps. Overall, it's OK and is something different to do and should be used for someone who hasn't been exercising."
4,Denise Austin,"I always enjoy Denise's exercise videos as her routines are always easy to follow. This is not an advanced aerobics video, however, and I didn't get my heart rate way up there. It was challenging in that I need to work on balance and things of that nature and she included some exercises in that genre. I'll probably only use it on a day when I don't need to grind it out, tho."
4,Great fun but not a hard workout,"I enjoy this DVD and when I'm not motivated to do something more difficult, I pop it in. It's a lot of fun, but I would say it's a medium level intensity workout, with minimal sculpting to anything but the legs. I love the ballet sculpt section for my legs, but you do about 4 pushups and that's really it for arms. I'd like to see more arms and abs in the sculpting section.This workout is 50 minutes long if you do the entire thing. The DVD is nice because if you don't have time you can cut things out and just do a few of the dances or cut out the cool down.Denise can be a bit confusing the first time through the DVD but I urge you to watch it again and you'll catch on. It's not a tough workout, and if you're in great shape you probably won't even sweat, but it's a nice workout for days you want or need a little bit less activity but still want to work out."
2,"Nice Idea, Lame Execution","Why waste your time when there are so many better dance workout dvds? I like the idea of four dance types in one workout, but this did not meet my expectations. The jazz routine is pretty fun, but the Latin and 'club funk' are lame. I do not recommend attempting these moves outside your living room. The music is an afterthought: synth tunes reminiscent of elevator music will not help you get into the routines. The 'ballet' is just a generic sculpt routine, except the squats are referred to as pliés. Actually, there are several instances when Denise refers to first position as plié, which is rather amusing. It is pretty clear that she does not have a dance background. Moreover, this is not even a very good workout. I hardly broke a sweat, and I'm not in particularly stellar shape. There a plenty of workouts that are more fun and more effective."
2,"No Denise Austin, I did not have fun.","I bought this thinking it would be a fun way to squeeze some exercise into my busy schedule, but I fould it utterly annoying. Like others, I find her ""enthusiam"" extremely cheesy. Plus, she doesn't exactly tell you what's she's doing. Trying to follow the steps is difficult because each one has its own random number of times that she does it. By the end of the second work-out, I was so frustrated that I will probably never use this again."
1,LAME,This video was horrible! It's suppose to be an upbeat workout instead it's a boring workout to elevator music. She also has an annoying weird tone throughout the video that will give anyone nightmares including her odd facial experessions.
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,This knife is great. It fits so well in my hand and I feel very comfortable using it. It is light yet sturdy. I sliced tomatoes today and was so excited that they came out so perfectly! No smashed tomatoes! I would highly recommend this knife. The price is good and I will definetly be saving to buy more from Furi.
2,Wasted Talent,"Dedeaux defintitely has a way with language. His lush descriptions of the female form and vivid portrayal of the same form under severe torture are unique. Ultimately, however, 'Transfer Point-Nice' is merely a misogynist's wet-dream. The protagonists, Vikki and Joy, are mere girls. Dedeaux is hyperbolic in his description of them, from their enormous breasts to their well shaped buttocks. The tortures that the girls suffer are ingenious and creative. Unfortunately, all of it is non-consensual. Of course, Dedeaux portrays the girls as promiscuous, bi-sexual sluts and deserving of all the torture and rape that they receive."
5,Look alike,I swear this dude looks like chucky...other than that it's an interesting book I recomend a read.
5,I've Read It Over & Over!,"Clay's book mirrors him. Smarty, witty, funny, sweet, talented--beautiful inside and out. I can't say enough about this book or about the man himself. I read it in one sitting, I just couldn't stop. And I find that I go back and re-read portions of it just for the pure enjoyment of his words. It's Clay through and through. You'll enjoy it, for sure! I makes a great Christmas gift. That and his Christmas CD. I gave them out last Christmas and made a whole new legion of fans."
5,Nice Swissgear computer rolling case,"I brought it recently.I compared over the internet and find the best deal I could get on Amazon.I've been planning to buy it for last 1 year and didn't get the time to order until I decided to go for it in the last minute as I am traveling on 12/10/09, needed a laptop carrier on time.I ordered and luckily got on time with better deal.The product is the same as described in Amazon.comThe reason I picked:1. I wanted ample space for my laptop and other accessories.2. I needed a space to have a pair of my clothes for one night.3. I needed a separate case for my laptop in case I don't need the whole rolling case.4. Becoz of the Swiss brand, its strong, sturdy with wear and tear.I might recommend some of my friends to buy it.I really love the way it looks.Thanks to Amazon and J&R; company."
5,Rolling office,Very nice case...exceeded my expectations and a very good price as well. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
4,Sounds Plausible!,"Now, I don't know all that much about Shakespeare, but from the information presented in this book, I agree that the Bard's plays could quite possibly have been written by Christopher Marlowe. The [quantity of] evidence is presented in an easy-to-understand, organized manner. I'll never think of Shakespeare the same again!"
4,A Good Clean Hard Trance Selection,"This is an album that appeals to the desire for speed while layering with intelligent synthetic landscaping. It is at once dark and liquid while being vocal and enlightened. The hard thing for a dj to create in a mix is a nonstop emotional ride, and while hardware doesn't fully live up to the bill, he still remains solid throughout. It is a good mix with only a small amount of downtime and repetition."
1,terible,this game is terrible expecialy if you have a jostick. it takes hours to install even if you have tons of ram. do not buy this game
3,Would get 5 Stars if HIStory Double-Disc set wasnt released!,"This is a classic selection of songs, but HIStory has been released with another disc, really who would spend their money on this one when at the same price you can get another disc and a massive slip case!. This CD is great though, containing alot of great MJ classics before 1995. But if you really wanted all of Mj's Hit singles buy all of his albums, because there are ALOT more hit singles that havent appeared on any greatest hits collections, MJ is one of the greatest artists of all time and this CD proves it, but it should not have been released with the HIStory double-disc set released a while before."
5,CD,this CD is great! item was perfect and came in a timely fashion. I am happy with my purchase. thank you very much
5,Very good reading if you felt you watch John Jr. grow up.,I felt I grew up with John Jr since he was close to my age and was always in the spotlight. This book revealed how much of the spotlight he was in and how he graciously tried to handle it. Obviously there couldn't be very much information on him and Carolyn's relationship but the book helped me through the mourning period and handling his death a little better. I felt I lost a brother too when he died. I couldn't put it down.
3,I'll take the Quinto Sisters version,"Not bad, Burl, but I prefer the version of ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" by the Quinto Sisters, which was actually earlier. They also recorded ""Most Wonderful Day of the Year"" and ""Santa's Elves"" which also ended up on the Rudolph TV special. Give them a listen if you can find the album, it's wonderful!"
5,Wonderful Christmas Songs for the Whole Family!,"When I was a child, my father played the Holly Jolly Christmas LP every year for my brothers and sisters and I. Burl Ives sang so clearly and the songs were so accessible that we learned them quickly and sang right along with him. This year, my 6-year old grandson learned Christmas songs in school and, while singing them to me, I was reminded about the LP and my own childhood experience of joyful singing. You can imagine my delight when I checked Amazon and saw that the album has been reiisued on a CD. It came in just a few days and in time for Christmas. My grandson loves it and we sang the songs together with much joy for weeks beyond Christmas. I will be buying this CD for all my siblings next year for Christmas."
5,I love listening to Oh Holy Night!,"I discovered this CD as I was searching for ""Mary Did You Know"" and ""Oh Holy Night."" As I had never heard of this artist, I was stunned to hear his voice via the snippets provided for MP3. I purchased the MP3 immediately and then purchased the CD a few weeks later (it was back in stock).I have been listening to this CD througout the last two years. Beautiful music; I am so thankful that my two favorite songs are included on this CD! I have also reviewed his song ""Mary Did You Know"" and have listed additional ""Mary Did You Know"" versions in that review."
2,Bad item description,"The flash drive is ok, I guess, but the item description CLAIMS that a USB cable is included which is a lie. The package the drive comes in is just big enough for the cable, so it's not like the package was only partly-filled. When I contacted Amazon about the problem they told me to contact the manufacturer, who finally responded 3-4 weeks later. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
3,go to the family,"instead of reading this I suggest you pick up Maurice Lever's book ""Sade"" the family of the Marquis gave him the private letters and unpublished facts concerning their great great great grandfater. Fascinating."
3,"Nice blade, but the handle is miniscule.","Basically the blade is great, but the handle is too small. I would suggest buying a different one. Perhaps oxo."
4,Great Carryall,"I bought this for my wife to carry her camera equipment when traveling. She is by no means a ""professional"" photographer but the stuff you carry with you starts to add up and this accomidates all of her equipment well. What was most important was the fact that while carrying a camera, flash, lenses, batteries, I-pod, camcorder, memory cards etc. it easily accomidates and protects her laptop. The top compartment (while not huge) has space for a cloth backdrop or other miscellaneous items. The backpack isnt cumbersome but for everyday use you may want something smaller to carry just the camera body a flash and a few lenses. Hope this helped!"
2,Computer pocket is dangerous,"I've taken this bag overseas several times and had the bag for 2 years. The compartments and side pouches are very nice to use. The padding on the straps is very comfortable and I could wear this bag for hours. After a while the zipper on the computer pocket has failed twice. Be very aware that because this is a side loaded computer pocket. If you forget to zip it up, it will fall out. I'm right handed and sling backpacks over my right shoulder as a habit. Twice i've been in a rush, forgotten to zip it up and subsequently listened to my laptop slide out and go flying across the floor. ugh.... I've since switched to the Tamrac 5788 Evolution 8 and have been quite happy with it but I won't comment on it since I haven't had it more than a month (and it's top loaded.)"
4,good value,"Easy to set up and gets great signal strength, better than my built in wireless that stopped working"
2,"No 5.0 GHz, Only 2.4GHz","This card does not support the ""optional"" 5.0 Ghz spectrum, only 2.4GHz. However, to fully realize the benefits of 802.11n, 5.0Ghz is required. Also, because it runs on 2.4GHz, your system will likely be competing for bandwidth with other computers and wireless phones around you, which can seriously degrade performance.Surprisingly, this limitation is not noted either on the box or in the manual. In fact, Belkin doesn't directly address it in the Troubleshooting section, instead directing one to contact Technical Support. Personally, I find this sneaky.To be complete, I will say that it runs fine on 2.4Ghz and was easy to set up. But I really wanted the traffic separation that 5.0Ghz allows."
4,"This floss slides quite easily between my teeth, ...","This floss slides quite easily between my teeth, which makes it good for getting into tight areas. The only problem is that the floss is so smooth, it can be hard to get a grip on it. I had to wind it around my finger a few extra times at the start to keep it from slipping out of my hand."
5,Beautiful,This is absolutely beautiful. I matted and framed it for a guest bedroom with an art deco theme. Looks great!
4,Delightful Read,"A thoroughly enjoyable read. Light, humorous and fun to read. At times I laughed out loud. I couldn't help myself. There is one particular scene of a meditation meeting at the local church, which is absolutely delightful. The humour in this scene comes from recognising the truth of the different personalities and Mary Sheepshanks descriptions. While this is not one of my Top 20 all-time books, it comes close."
4,Long live the 'King',"If not the king of Texas crime-writing, Rick Riordan is certainly among the princes in a royal family that already includes James Lee Burke and David Lindsey. And in ""the Last King of Texas,"" the third in Riordan's Tres Navarre series, the San Antonio suspense author proves he's no pretender to the throne.""The Last King of Texas"" is a wryly funny book, not dark, but definitely dusky. His metaphors are apt and entertaining, especially when they seem to parody the purplish gravity of some of Riordan's heroes, such as Hammett and Chandler: ""She laughed with all the warmth of rattling aluminum foil"" or ""(a meal) with a enough cornbread to construct a small toolshed."" With his sardonic voice, his tarnished virtue and his unlucky-at-love-and-rental-properties back story, Navarre is a low-rider knight in rusty armor. And Riordan just might be the king after all"
3,"works, durability is an issue",maybe i'm just too rough but a couple of the sections have fallen apart. i mushed them back together and they still work but sometimes the rack falls out...
3,Try the next generation Glide Floss,"Try the newer version of Glide Floss called ""Comfort Plus"" Glide Floss instead. It does as good a cleaning job as the older version here; but the ""Comfort Plus"" version is much softer on the edges, it won't cut into your gum or lip as much."
1,Don't work very well.,Depth of the size they say they are do not match original guides that came with razor. Too much variation from one size to another.
3,6 Clipper Guide Combs,"The quality is poor, flimsy, bendable. I should have known for the price that there was something wrong. You get what you pay for."
4,Before and After Getting Your Puppy,"As it turns out I didn't get the puppy I was expecting, so I have more time to continue reading this helpful book. There is much to learn if you want to have a well-behaved dog for the rest of its life in your family. This book is a veritable font of instructions, tips, advice, and clues into how to lead your puppy. Since dogs require an alpha dog in the pack to be truly content, you, as dog owner, must take the reins, or your dog will take them for you, and you'll both be dissatisfied. It's amazing what a badly-behaved dog can make you do! Make the decision now to read this book and take charge of your puppy. Show him who's boss, and you'll both be better off for it. There is nothing like the devotion and demeanor of a great dog. The more people that follow this book's information, the fewer abused, abandoned, and unwanted dogs there will be. If you've ever been to an animal shelter you know exactly what I mean. This book will enable you to have a wanted dog."
5,Thank Goodness!,Just got this yesterday and it is the best book ever! Only wish we had it before we brought our puppy home. It is easy to follow instructions that simply work and make sense. In one day there has been a vast improvement w/house training because it doesn't allow room for mistakes. This book is a must have for new puppy owners!
3,Good but flawed.,"Mr. Burns advances a excellent critique regarding the attempt of South American elites to ape western style capitalism. He suggests that attempts to cram western economic/political ideas into the dynamics of Latin America did considerably more harm than good.What Mr. Burns does not address is that the remedy advocated by many of the critics of those regimes was in very much the same vein. Marxist philosophy, theorized in the traditon of western thought- with western nations in mind, proved to be as ill a fit for Latin America as was western style capitalism.Mr. Burns failure to realize this is the books ultimate dowfall.The end product is a study of Latin American hierarchical elites who sought to remake Latin America in 19th century Western Europe's image and a implication the results would have been different if they had modelled it after 20th century Eastern Europe. A good book soured by moldy Marxism."
3,Poorly represented color,"These suspenders show up as a light blue on the illustration -- like washed jeans. But, when you get them they are dark, navy blue---despite the name of ""ocean blue."" I wanted a lighter blue as they appeared to be when shown online. So, I will be returning them."
5,This is the best CD!,"Youngstown rocks! They are the best new band out there, and are better than 'n sync and backstreet boys. Their CD is great! As soon as I saw them on Disney, I had to go and buy their CD, and it was worth it. I love them so much and so do all of my friends. The guys in Youngstown have great voices and they sound awesome! Anybody who doesn't have this CD, go out and get it!"
2,Could be so much better,"Let me start by saying these guys have a fair amount of talent. They have relatively good voices, and sound great together. They also write some of their own songs, which is another plus. Unfortunately, like many boybands before and after them, they were rushed to produce and finish their album while the Backstreet Boy and 'N Sync craze was still lasting, and only had one single worthy track on the album, which is their hit I'll Be Your Everything. Everything else is filler that is painful to listen to (Especially when you know how much better they could do). The reason why bands like 'N Sync or BSB have lasted is that the record companies take time in finding songs for them. Therefore most every track can be a hit single. With bands like Youngstown, Take 5, No Authority, etc you get either a hit single or absolutely nothing. If Youngstown gets a sophomore effort, hopefully more time will be taken on it, because this was kind of dissapointing."
2,"Youngstown May be good, but their album isn't!","After hearing ""I'll be Your Everything"", my hopes had been raised in thinking that Youngstown's new album ""Let's Roll"" would contain great songs which could rival LFO, Nsync, 5ive, etc.. But after purchasing their album, I was EXTREMELY dissapointed. ""Pedal to the Steel"" and ""I'll Be Your Everything"" are the ONLY two good songs on the album. The rest of the songs are boring, dull, and are filler material. It's a shame, because I thought that perhaps Youngstown had potential, but their album definitly does not show this, nor did their lip-synching show this on the Disney In Concert Special. I can only hope that Youngstown realizes the mistake of this poorly produced album, and creates a new album which has a higher quality in it's sound and songs! Once that occurs, I'm sure Youngstown won't have a hard time breaking into the Teen Pop Act as a strong contender."
3,No competition for Louie DeVito & Bad Boy Joe,I just bought this c.d. after I had already gotten Louie DeVito's Dance Factory c.d....and there just isn't any comparison. I know Mike Rizzo is one of KTU's jocks...but his mixing lacks the incredible energy of Louie DeVito's Dance Factory. I think this is due in large part to DJ Bad Boy Joe who obviously does much of the mixing and editing on Louie's C.D. Bad Boy Joe's mixing really ROCKS! And I've yet to hear anyone that can match him. So if you're considering the NYC Dance Party...I'd recommend buying Louie DeVito's & Bad Boy Joe's Dance Factory too...and you be the judge.
5,The best 'greatest hits' album of 2004 ?,"It could very well be the best 'greatest hits' album of 2004! As any british person know, Status Quo have had more hit singles than any other band in England (even beating the rolling stones!), and this album provides a great collection of their songs and some album tracks that weren't even singles! Although there are some of their Top 10 tracks that arn't on this (Rollin' Home, Ol' Rag Blues, Dear John), it still is a great album by any standards. Ideal for parties (as you don't need to keep skiping through the CD to find a decent song), or just a loud, beer drinking afternoon with your mates. No faults with this. Even if you only know 'Caroline' or 'Rocking All Over The World', buy it and get yourself hooked to the great riffs and catchy choruses of Status Quo..... ""Get down, deeper and down!"""
3,"Works great, but...","I got this to fit my Baby Jogger City Select. It works great -- keeps drinks secure and fits even really big containers. However, it only gets 3 stars because the attachment gets in the way of the seat if you try to recline it from the upper seating position. I got around the problem by only putting the seat in the lower position. Also, you have to move the cup holder every time you want to fold the stroller because it will get in the way of the wheels."
1,Gets in the way of seats,"The connection to the stroller is a very poor fit for the City Select. The ""clamp"" portion is long and gets in the way of the seats. There are only a few practical places to attach it, and they all interfere with some other aspect of operation, like extending the handle bar. It also makes it more difficult to fold the stroller up to put in the car. We are buying the parent console and taking the cup holder off."
3,Works with Baby Jogger City Mini,I was looking for one that could work with our city mini baby jogger- and this one does. It does the job- It does need tightening once in a while- but thats easy to do.
2,not impressive....,"I have the 2010 city select and got two of these holsters and it was ok to put on, however after barely 4 months they are lose and to be honest don't fit the stroller the best either, if you get two, the second one will interfear wtih the stroller break; so in all essense the second one is a bit useless. Directions were a bit ehhh. We did get the parent consol, recently and that fits much better and has one cup holder and two other compartments, which you can put a beverage etc in it. I definitely wish i put the stroller together first and saw what little room there was to put this on, as the space to put it is limited."
1,doesn't fit baby jogger city mini 2011,"Even at the tightest setting, this slides down the handle bar of the Baby Jogger City Mini (2011). Also, as other reviews have stated, it is not made by Baby Jogger. I would return it but my husband threw away the packaging. At least I got a screwdriver out of it."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH CITY SELECT,"It says it's compatible with all baby joggers, however it does not fit on the city select. If it did, it would probably be great"
3,Typo report,"This is a massive and useful reference book, but here's another typo warning:(12.96) is wrong in two places : the y should be a z (obviously), and more subtly, the formula m = 2 nu +1 should be nu = 2 m + 1.The authors don't seem to be collecting typos anywhere else online; perhaps this will make it into the next edition."
2,"Pickett great, production ain't","Not a bad performance, but it's tempered by the lackluster production and songwriting skills of Jon Tiven and his cronies. Highlight is the great vocal treatment on ""Outskirts of Town,"" which would have been a hit record...if it was 1969."
2,"great sounds and parts, but...","...they often don't add up to ANYTHING! That is, unless you're looking for meandering collections of ""parts"" and ""riffs"" produced with the retro-fication factor at about 10 billion... i really dig most of the parts, too, but a song like the one about the pharoa's slave (or whatever) could REALLY benefit from a good editor: it would be great if it was about 4 minutes SHORTER! these guys seem to feel the need to clear out, as it were, their entire back catalogue of riffs on half the tracks here... Anyway, I'll keep checking out this band's stuff, even though they're associated with the apples in stereo! if you want to hear REALLY GOOD songs with crazy structures, i advise you to check out Mr Bungle's California or Frank Zappa's One Size Fits All album... if you haven't already!"
5,An Unnoticed Treasure,"A truly amazing album from start to finish. Sixties influenced fuzzy mod pop updated with very clever and adventurous songwriting and lyrical brilliance. A must have for all fans of new and vintage garage, mod,psych, and brit-pop."
5,Extremely Dangerous,"What can i say about this record? I must confess i bought it without listening, trusting on how much i liked Andreas Scholl's ""Heroes"", and became completely crazy when i started to hear it. The record was amazing; Andreas Scholl on his highest level; Barbara Bonney's envolving voice making you spin on your toes; and all this supported by the amazing Talens Lyrique.The duets are superb and the two diferent Salve Reginas are the best i've ever heard. You're probably asking ""why extremely dangerous?"", but you'll see, once you bought it, your neighbours will want to kill you to stop you from listening to it over and over again weeks in a row."
2,Turgid and mannered!,"Karajan completely undermines what should have been the AIDA of a generation. What a waste of a magnificent cast and orchestra, not to mention one of the best recording jobs of its period.His tempo choices alone ruin the recording. Tebaldi is obviously at sea, and who could blame her? Everything is overextended and/or overemphasized. And for what reason, except to prove that he is the great Karajan and totally in charge?A great opportunity, completely missed."
1,"bad information, badly designed","This book should have been called ""trainwreck of thoughts"" It looks like it was designed by the n-gen design machine, and the advice is poor and disorganized. It shows impressive ignorance of information architecture and usability, as well as solid design practices, and seems to be written by a moderately talented ""artiste"" who wrangled a book contract during the good times of publishing. I cannot believe any technical editing or fact checking was done on this beast.go read tolleson's book, tibor's books or even hillman curtis's book if you want inspiration. For knowledge of the user centered design practice, get ""designing websites that work: usability for the web"" which -- despite the title -- gives advice on the entire design process."
5,SanDisk 2 GB MemoryStick Pro Duo,Great price and great performance. Used it for Sony camera with no compatiblity issues.
5,Great item,Bought this for my digital camera and I wonder how I ever took pictures with out it. The 2 gigs lets me shoot away and not worry about running out of space.
1,There are better software out there!,"Please look around and be more futuristic.Peachtree has lots of unfixed bugs and is out dated. I tested some software and found some really good, with reasonable price: BusinessWorks, Small Business Manager (microsoft.com), Quick Business Manager (bisaim.com),Vision Point 2000 (ACCPAC), BusinessVision 32 (Softline).Good Luck in your search."
4,Addictive,"Mr. Goddard's done it again: ""Caught in the light"" is one of those books you simply can't put down until you reached the back cover. The book is written in the finest Goddard tradition, history interwoven with the present and a protagonist chasing the elusive truth for hundreds of pages."
2,Extremely poor quality,"The original of this wonderful collection of stories and outstanding color illustrations was one of my childhood favorite books. I ordered this extremely cheaply photocopied black-and-white version because I was so excited to see the book available for my grandchildren. To charge so much for this terrible copy, with tiny, faint, hard-to-read text and copies of the illustrations that are so poor that in many cases they're simply black blobs, is a travesty.DO NOT pay for this book! It's practically illegible and a complete rip-off. It's too bad the large-format original book isn't available any longer, but this is worse than having no copy at all."
5,Wildest Hearts,"Wildest Hearts is a great contemporary romance. The characters are wonderful, colorful and engaging. Krentz did a superb job of presenting this story.Annie Lyncroft does what few modern women would have the guts to do which is propose marriage to a man.....a marriage of convenience. Annie is a slightly quirky character who is fun and easy going.Oliver Rain is a man surrounded by mystery. His personality is cold,hard and smooth. Oliver is a very controlling man and strangely methodic.The relationship between Annie and Oliver surges out of control as the suspense and drama build in the story. Annie and Oliver search for clues surrounding her brother's disappearance while trying to save Lyncroft Unlimited.Annie enjoys thawing Oliver's icy heart while Oliver struggles to maintain control. Wildest Heart's is a wonderful story thats even better the second time."
4,Great product! It has a great light mint ...,Great product! It has a great light mint flavor. Would highly recommend. It glides smoothly between your teeth.
2,Everything You Already Knew About Screenplays But Were Afaid To Admit,"No new information in this book for those of us who have grown up on films. Kate Wright reminds us what we already know about film structure which is probably why she is a ""top Hollywood script coach"". If you have never taken a film course or read a script writing book, then there is value in what Ms. Wright has written because it lays out some very basic storytelling principals.I would not read this book again and am sorry that I spent the $22.00 on it."
2,Sterile Seeds,"I was disappointed in this work from a highly regarded author. It is well-written, the characters are well-defined and believable, and the portrait of post-colonial Indian history and castes is insightful.Nonetheless, the plot is slow, dense, bland, meandering, disjointed, simplistic and unbelievable. The main and supporting characters are weak, drifting, incapable, pointless, selfish, callous and mundane.The author is critical of colonialism, class and capitalism but provides no hints of true solutions in his description of variegated guerilla warfare. At best, I concluded that youthful perceptions of injustice together with the desire for meaning/relevance lead to meaningless totalitarian or anarchical states."
2,Two narrow to be considered Dentaltape,"This possibly could be considered an extra-wide dental floss but scarcely a tape, even for dental use. I find many uses for dental tape outside the oral cavity and am looking for the type of dental tape that used to be available. This is not it. This serves my purpose only after doubling and redoubling it, then twisting it so it can be easily handled--a lengthy and awkward process."
5,Sweet Success,"As a professional personal coach I found Rich Fettke's ""Extreme Success"" an excellent resource for tips and techniques for use with my clients (not to mention myself!). My favorite is his idea of dealing wtih fears that inhibit us from doing the things we need to do to move forward in our lives. Called ""dancing with your protector,"" it's an imaginative and powerful way to reframe the obstacles in our lives in a way that can actually propel us forward with a greater liklihood of success.I host a radio program in Seattle called ""The Working Life!(tm)"" and have interviewed Rich about his book. I found him to be engaging and sincerely interested in helping all of us to make the most of what we've been given in this life. If we can do that--really do that--then our success will not only be extreme, but sweet."
4,a fun read with some good ideas,"after i read a good review about this book in usa today, i checked out the author's website, watched the video there, and figured it was worth buying his book. i'm not really into ""self-help"" books, but this sounded more like a fun read. next step? amazon.com! i was right...it is a fun read and i actually got a couple new ideas about how to stay more focused instead of getting overwhelmed in this current economy.i would have liked even more of the adventure stories rich uses as examples for his points...but then again, i'm more of an ""experience it"" learner than a reader. i was also wishing there was a workbook for this because i didn't like having to write in the book for the self-quizzes and the life success wheel. overall though, i got some really good ideas from this book. i'm glad i bought it!"
3,Great if you can find a good place in your car.,"i bought this and thought it would work great where ever, but there are only certain spots in the car were it works. luckily i got velcro strips and put it on my dash. its clear there but at times in different areas can be a little fuzzy. good for the price though, but if you are looking for one with no fuzzy noise stick with an audio cable"
1,Get what you pay for,"I love my pets, so I'm always looking for something fun for them to do. Ten bucks for a motorized hamster in a ball? Sounds like great fun!Wrong.The ball for the motorized critter weakly pops together, any sort of pressure on the ball has a very solid chance of breaking it open. The hamster also shorted out very quickly despite being brand new.I had this toy out of the box and working for less than two hours, and promptly threw it away in disgust."
2,Hamusuta Happy Hamster died fast death,"First, let me say the Seller would get six stars for the rapid delivery of the product and I would use him/her again for more durable toys.This was a fun toy for the three minutes it lasted. The hamster in the ball fascinated my Scottish terrier. It could not, however, stand up to the fierce jaws of the dog. He had it open within a couple of minutes and the toy hamster croaked in another two minutes.Would recommend it for toy dogs or breeds that do not have the brains to figure out how to take the ball apart. Mine didn't break the ball, just took it apart."
4,Possible motor problem,"I got this toy from an odd store near my house and it wouldn't work with a new battery. I went back to the store and got a different hamusuta and it worked perfectly.It is very cute and more realistic compared to the zu zu pets (looks more like a real hamster) however it doesn't change direction.It fits my purpose of a gift for a friend who is living in a small dorm next year. Good product, but I don't know if the first hamusuta problem is common or not."
3,Fun for a while,"Fun lasted about 3 days. Grand-daughter got bored with it. Product is o.k., but limited."
3,flasugar,"I bought this for my 3yr old grand daughter. She likes the toy ok but is pretty rough with it. She wants to throw it, but I'm afraid the ball will shatter."
3,Not an audio cd,"This is an early Bee Gees release. I expected an audio cd, but this is mp3 type files that my win 7 pc would not read, let alone play. I had to transfer the files to .wav type on my old xp machine and burn them to disc so they would be playable anywhere. The music is good, some songs stick in your head forever. It should have been formatted differently however."
3,unusual bee gees,not the normal bee gees sound. a lot of the songs were very similar to beatles songs.
1,Do Not Recommend,"Great little light, that doesn't last. The manufacturer guarantees them, but you can not replace the battery yourself, and the fees charged to send it away to have that done are ridiculous. Light only lasted several months before the battery died. I wasted $20 + s/h for mine. I see $4 ones available online now. Going to try one of those next. At least they don't make worthless claims and promises."
1,50' Magna Hose,"Looks like a good idea but it burst on the first use. It is made out of the same stuff that beach balls are. Also its not uv resistant so you can't leave it outside in the sun. All of these roll up hoses are a waste, buy a good quality full size hose and it will last for years."
2,Cabinet Grease Remover,"That product does not remove the grease as it should do, you have to try a few times to remove some grease from your furniture and still it leaves you sandy surface."
1,Gorilla Grip III - Junk!,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this item! The first one I received was defective and was replaced with issue from the vendor. However, it won't deter a thief as it can be pulled out of the way in seconds to steer the vehicle... the alarm is more of an annoyance and can't be heard outside the vehicle. All you can hope for is the blinking LED light will deter a potential be thief."
2,People lover Glide but it is not the most effective in fighting gum disease,Glide is not the most effective in preventing gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). With flossing we want to remove bacterial plaque buildup underneath the gumline. Glide slides over the plaque and doesn't remove it as effectively as rougher floss (such as Reach) If you want to clean your bath tub do you use soft cloth or some thing rough to scrub it clean? However using Glide is more effective as not flossing at all.
4,Red Slime Remover,"Works pretty well. Not perfect,but the best product for the slime that I have used so far."
5,Quick And Painless,A very quick and painless way to get rid of that annoying red slime that tends to always plague our tank during the hot summer months.
3,Not Impressed,"I only gave the product 3 stars because by the time I received it I believe most of the algae was already dead by simply raising the oxygen in the water to very high levels with my aeration system producing an environment that does not sustain the algae or promote growth; I conclude this by the lack of activity in my skimmer. I modified my eShoppes skimmer by including an Oceanic Limewood Mini Airstone for Oceanics' Biocube Skimmer, into the reaction chamber of my eShoppes skimmer producing extremely high levels of bubbles. Even the smallest protein and particulate matter is normally collected. There was very little in the collection cup and I did not experience the high level of skimmer activity experience by other users - conclusion - most of the algae was already dead.Now if there was an affective product to clean up the dead algae adhering to the ornaments without taking the ornament out of the tank it would great."
1,flimsier than I thought it would be,"This thing is great for seeing the screen when you're shooting outdoors, and keeping people away from your LCD. Nothing more annoying then when you're trying to shoot and everyone says, ""OOHHH Can I take a look"", and if they're real camera neophytes you can point to the back of your dSLR and say ""no LCD, its film, I'll show you the pics next week when I scan the film and get them on my computer"".However, the vertical side doors that swing open to hold the roof/top up are really flimsy: the hinges where they attache and the springs. It died on my after only a few months. Didn't want to spend the money to replace it.On the flip side, it is a great tool for developing yourself as a photographer if you came about in the digital era. It helps you trust your brain's light meter and stop checking the LCD after every shot. Just shoot."
3,Interesting and practical subjects covered,"This is probably the only Arabic instruction book I've bought that actually attempts to teach you the language as opposed to describing the language. It does have too much grammar at times and it certainly is too short, but it's by far the most accessible introductory work I've seen. Most words are fully vocalized (pausal form usually) but the author stops transliterating after the first few lessons. I would prefer transliteration throughout. Also towards the end of the book you get bombarded with terse and complex treatment of derived verb forms. More drills should be included to help learners absorb the basic vocabulary, verb and noun forms. I wish all the grammar could be dropped so that the user learns just by imitating the author. Good value overall."
1,typhoon professional 14-inch nonstick work set,"The handle was broken and I did not have choice but to return it back and it looked like the paint was going to come off any minute. Here is the lesson that I learn from ordering cheap nonstick work set, you get what you paid for."
3,This floss seemed like it would work fine ...,"This floss seemed like it would work fine for most people, but it didn't for me. Some of my teeth are close together and when flossing those, this floss got stuck and then """"broke"""" in my teeth. I think it's a decent product but just didn't fit my needs."
4,This floss won't shred no matter what. It's ...,This floss won't shred no matter what. It's the best floss I've ever used.
3,"Brush is okay, but not the best","I expected to like it more, but found that my hair gets stuck in the brushwhile I'm styling my hair. It's a round brush used for styling with ahair dryer, but it's not particularly effective."
1,Retarded Horton Heat,"I bought this CD because Mike Ness was listed among other CD's purchased by RHH fans. What a mistake! RHH simply lacks the soul, passion, and insight of an artist like Ness. All RHH seems to do is make fun of all their subject matter and life in general. Lest you think I have no sense of humor, I can easily enjoy the efforts of a band like Southern Culture On The Skids. While they share a similar irreverence with RHH at least they have some talent to add to the formula. Would someone please explain the appeal of RHH?"
4,A good alternative,"I am not R.C. myself, but sometimes I have occasion to go to R.C. services. I have nearly always been disappointed both by the quality of the music and the execution thereof. Not so long ago I had occasion to attend a R.C. service where ""The Adoremus"" hymnal was used; I could scarcely believe my ears. The congregation---a diverse one, with people from infants up through octegenarians, both Caucasians and African Americans--sang with enthusiasm. It seemed as though the 'Senior Citizens' and the Teens and Twentysomethings were most into it, while the 30 through 50 year olds were more passive.While I can't claim to be an expert on RC music ministries, I can't help think that this hymnal had something to do with the quality of the worship life."
3,Almost...,"By the mid-eighties it was obvious Mandrell was in need of another great singing partner. Her magic with David Houston in the early seventies was legendary. In the attempt to work some new magic with Lee Greenwood, Mandrell just barely succeeds. The wondrous pop ballad ""To Me"" is pure heaven, but most of the other tracks on this album are too repetitive, and not on the good side. A weak album, but definitely worth pressing for the above mentioned classic!"
5,Good Book for Healing our soul,It's a good book for start healing our soul for any pain in our past life or for professional who look for a guide to help other people.
5,5 STARS JUST AREN'T ENOUGH FOR THIS BOOK!,"I definitely recommend this book to survivors of abuse!! When there was no one there for me, or when no one knew what to say, this book was there for me. All of the feelings, emotions, etc. were explained in this book and it has really helped me in my journey of recovery. You can either read this one along or along with ""The Courage to Heal"". They go hand in hand and have been my lifesavers!!"
1,This book is VERY dangerous if you have repressed memories,"This book is very damaging to vulnerable people looking for answers about why their lives aren't going well.There are many people who have been genuinely sexually abused and their memories of the event have always been with them. But for people looking to find an answer to their problems by claiming repressed memory sexual abouse, this book is a killer. It will cause huge damage to your family - don't touch it. It is written by two women with no psychology/psychiatry qualifications.My sister read this book and she has caused immense damge to both herself and our family. I doubt she will ever recover. STAY AWAY AND SEE A PROFESSIONAL OR READ BOOKS WRITTEN BY PROFESSIONALS. This book stinks."
5,I think this book is a wonderful book about twins .,This book is about two twin girls who are best friends. But they find themselves making all new friends. They find they cant never ever fight! I enjoyed this book alot.I rrecomend it to my friends. I rated it a nine because it wasnt my favorite
5,This book tells the adventures two twins can get into.,"I loved this book so much. It was fun to read. I'm a big Sweet Valley Twins fan and try to read every book in the series. I think the most funny part was when Lila ate shaving cream and was sooo embarrassed that she pouted. I recommend this book to every person who loves to read about Jessica and Elizabeth. If you love to read this book series, please send me e-mail at my address. Happy Reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Never received the steamer!!!!,"I ordered this product on April 27, 2009 and have never received it. Today is May 28th. I sent an email to the seller with no return response. Please do not make any purchases from this seller unless you want your money to be stolen."
5,un fantasma recorre el mundo,Lo mejor expresandonos qué es el comunismo. ese fantasma que inevitablemente tendrá que llegar.....
3,Cute...,"I thought this was cute to a certain extent. The distrust about the baby was over done. Thomas kept saying he would except the child but by his actions, I cannot believe he would. The whole enemy thing happened very quickly. First the only issue was about their son and then all of a sudden there is a mysterious enemy that wants to cause harm and then the issue with both the enemy and the baby are solved in 10 pages. I looked forward to reading this story because the concept seemed interesting but there was so much to contend with and it caused the story to fall flat in my eyes."
3,Tend to run a little tight and small,"I have two pairs of these, and like the fact that they don't reveal a panty line, but they tend to run a bit tight and small, and don't have much stretch to them. I prefer the Maidenform Flirty Tanga, which is cotton and a bit stretchier. Since comfort can be a matter of personal preference, though, I'd suggest buying a pair in a few styles to see which pair is most comfy before stocking up on them.Overall, I'd give these 3 1/2 stars."
4,This is a good'ern,"With all the trash music that is plaguing the airwaves and stores now it is refreshing to hear some ""real American"" music. Dirk Powell and his group serve up a nice mess of tunes and play them very well. Hats off to Dirk and the crew. This is one album that lovers of old time music should add to there collection. Fine listening.Arkansas Red-Ozark TroubadourOzark Mountains, Arkansas"
1,More Tangles than I started with,"If you want to detangle your hair, forget it, this stuff in no shape or form detangles anything. Save your money and buy a bottle of a drugstore product at one of the big box stores. I actually had more tangles in my hair using this than I would have if I used nothing at all...even through out the day. NO STARS would be more appropriate."
5,Great game,Starcraft is A truly great game the fact that there are three different races and they are fairly well balanced. I find that the Zerg tend to be the best but the humans and protoss still match up pretty well against them. The whole secret is finding the stategeys and thus the race that works best the way you play and going from there. I think the coolest part of the game is that Each group has so many completly different tacticts that complement each other.
3,Good Price - Great Game,An oldy but goody. The price is awesome for what you get. With Starcraft II though you probably don't need to waste time on this. Get your upgrade.
3,Unable to install,"This purchase was the first amazon purchase that was corrupt. I recieved two disk ones and did not recieve a disk two. Therefore, I was unable to load the game. Also, one of the disk ones was corrupt and could not be read by the cd player."
1,Would rather eat candy canes,"This game is terrible, the graphics stink, the gameplay is very shallow AT BEST, no wonder people are selling it for so cheap, it's worth just as much as a couple of rolls of toilet paper, atleast with toilet paper u can wipe your a$$ with it, this game is actually so horribly awful I might actually use it like toilet paper.To give you some understanding of how boring and crappy, (oh I cant emphasize how god awful the graphics are) I would say that I would rather eat some candy canes, and I F-ing hate CANDY!!!"
5,The BEST of its kind!,"I have played all of the Command & Conquer games, but StarCraft beats them all! To start with, the sounds and graphics are spectacular. The missions quite challenging and thuroughly absorbing. The player has the option of choosing from three distinct races, each having their own set of missions. This intriguing option makes StarCraft superior to any other game of this type.I do have some minor criticisms, however. The strategy guides included in the Battle Chest are cheaply printed. The black and white screen shots range from poor to altogether useless. Also, the animated faces of the speakers during mission briefings are somewhat puppet-like. I would have preferred human actors as in Command & Conquer."
5,"Good game, good fun.",This is the best computer game i have evr played it dosn't have much blood/gore and is isn't just fighting. You have to build mine you use your brain for stradegy.
3,Dated and Shouldnt Have Bought it,I bought StarCraft as a Gold Box deal. The price was right but again I have learned the hard way. The nestalgia of playing an older game is tough to get back when the game runs in a much smaller resolution than my current systems. Even a High Resoltion hack doesnt help. It is best to remember the older games and move on.
4,Great product. Takes a little patience to apply.,"I have a lower denture that cannot be made to fit properly. I wear uppers and lowers. My dentist wants me to get implants. Through the V.A. I can get them for free. I am a 100% disabled Vietnam Hospital Corpsman. At first I did have a problem using this on my lower denture, but with a little patience I finally got it down to a science. Putting just enough to cover my denture. Bite down. Take it out, and apply a small amount of the newer Fixodent denture cream. Now I can eat steak, etc. It is better than going in for implants. This product is great if you are willing to learn how to use it properly for your type of denture fit. Denture cream by itself does not work for me. I have to always go to the men's room and reapply the cream. With a small amount of adhesive covering my denture, and then a thin strip of Fixodent. I am good to go all day. I am very pleased, but I took the time to solve my problem, and was not expecting a miracle cure."
4,Takes Getting Used To,"After I knew what I was doing with this product, I like it. I wasted almost half a tube before I knew what I was doing though. It serves the same purpose as the product where you pour the liquid into the powder, stir, pour on your dentures, stick them in your mouth, and wait for so many minutes, take them out, and trim away excess -- but this is easier. No mixing ,etc., - just put on your dentures, spread around (I wet the tip of my finger and spread it or push it around would describe it better), and put them in your mouth and go. Be sure and use it sparingly - a little seems to go a long way. I used way to much the first time and had a mess. It's not the paste that you would use daily like I thought it was. It's kinda like a reline but softer and a LOT less expensive."
1,Does not last more than regular adhesive.,"Does not last more than regular adhesives. I waited an hour beforeeating or drinking. It is extremely hard to remove as it becomes a plastic and adheres to the plates but not your mouth. Cleaning the product from the dental plates is almost impossible, had to wait for some of it to wear off. Disappointed."
4,CUSHION GRIP,"Nice product but after many trials, opted for another adhesive product. Although CUSHION GRIP is a good product, it takes second place, in my opinion, to EFFERGRIP. Why? Well, CUSHION grip requires placing tube in hot water for about 5 or so minutes and then applying to dentures. Besides, it costs a lot more than the EFFERGRIP. For some folks, this could be seen as okay because CUSHION GRIP doesn't need to be applied every day but maybe every 3-5 days while EFFERGRIP requires daily application.All in all, the ease of use of EFFERGRIP makes it the top choice, in my humble opinion."
4,Good product,This is a good quick fix. Doesn't last as long as the relining kits but still does a good job and fairly easy to use with no bad taste or smell.
2,Grip?,Another pain to use at least for me - would not buy it again. I can not really tell anyone else to try this.
1,a bunch of crap.,Not worth the cost to ship it. Does not do as advertised. Buyer Beware! Do not waste your money or time ordering it.
5,Splendid and Informative,"Jaen's book was indeed very useful to me. I am neither a costume designer nor a student of costume design; I am a professor interested in the art and culture of costumes, and I learned much about the business and the practice of theatre costume design by reading this delightful book. While its principal aim is to help students and professionals alike with the construction and maintenance of their design portfolios, the book is also very informative about the aesthetics, culture, theory, and practice of costume design (as well as stage, sound, and lighting). Jaen illustrates his book with many diverse examples, including his own beautiful sketches. I recommend this book to those, like me, who are outside of the theatre world but who have an interest in learning how it is done from the inside."
1,I didn't receive the shipment.,I have not received this order but has been charged. Please either credit back charged amount or ship the order immediately. I have very disappointed with Amazon.com.
2,Refill with brush is useless.,"Oral-B offers the best Interdental brush, the direction of brush could be changed by sliding up and down the parts of handle. Selling refill without the brush does not make sense."
5,"Heard it as a child, remembered it as an adult!","Wow! This guy really did a great job with this album. He captivated children with a clever way of retelling these great bible stories. These songs stayed in my heart and mind all these years. Now that I've down-loaded them, I could share them with the next generation! I wonder who else heard these songs as a child?"
2,Definitvely Not Doc Martin,"I had high hopes for this series based upon recommendations and the comparison to Doc Martin. I was so disappointed. Good characters, weak plots.Heavy emphasis on Leftist philosophy. If I had known it was going to be so propagandized, I would never have purchased it."
5,unifying and inspiring,"Direct, heartwarming, beautiful and points to what many of us have glimpsed and recognized as the nature of everything."
5,Another Desert Island Book,"When my mindfulness practice mentor suggested I read this book I ordered it directly and was thrilled to find a powerful spiritual guide in Suzuki. My mentor recently moved to the Mid-West and took this book with her in her purse so she would be sure not to lose it. I have to agree, the book is that important.These are transcripts of a retreat Suzuki gave - I don't believe he wrote at all as a teacher. They are I am sure faithful to the oral teachings, and in any case simply remarkable discourses. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It made my ten book desert island list which now has two books by Suzuki on it, this one and Zen Mind Beginners Mind."
2,It's not the best cd of Buckethead,In the same line of buckethead madness with less musical sense. A lot of noises and bizarre compositions but is not a real essence of this unique guitar player
2,"some tracks are alright, but its boring","I think that this album overall isnt that great, i expected so much more considering the price and the other reviews that i read, but i was immensely dissappointed. first of all yes twice with the sledge is very beautiful but thats really the only stand out to me, and slapatron is good if he didnt stop the song so abruptly. Danyel blows, Herbie can't sing and i dont know why he even tries, i think if i paid a dollar, i still would have been ripped off from this cd, just not up to par when it comes to these two monster musicians. His other cd's are hundreds of times better than this."
5,A Treasury of Christmas Miracles by Karen Kingsbury,Great Book to read during the Christmas season. I loved the stories of God's miracles during the holiday season. I highly recommend it to get you in the true Christmas spirit.
2,Hard plastic !!,"Are hard plastic, unwieldy, not what I expected, sales disappointed, not recommend.,very bad , no good for playing cards ,"
2,Set of four playing card holders,Disappointed that they did not perform to our satisfaction as they ar very limited for playing the card games our groups like to play.
1,Dreadful. Julie Smith Doesn't Miss a Cliche in this One,"Smith's cardboard characters include a perky gay man (ooh, he cooks, how original), foul mouthed alcoholic mom and her thoroughly dislikeable teenage daughter, raving psychopath bad guy (honestly, could she make it a little clearer that he's evil?), and chronically depressed main character, Skip Langdon. Okay, Skip, here's some advice -- lose 20 pounds and take a vacation.I found few redeeming features in this poorly written, badly plotted exercise in tedium."
5,Best Grind and Brew Available,This is the best grind and brew coffee maker I have seen. Easy to operate and easy to clean. We have had it for 5 months and not a single problem. Great tasting coffee every time. The timer allows you to wake up to the smell of freshly brewed delicious coffee.
1,Do NOT purchase this through orangeonions!,"I cannot speak to the quality of this product as I never used the one given to me as a gift, but whatever you do, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS (or anything else) FROM ORANGEONIONS! In my experience they will not answer your emails, but they may answer the phone. If you finally do get an RMA number they will claim they never received the product leaving you to contest the charge. Since they have Amazon backing them up the credit card companies will roll over and not accept your proof of deliver leaving you with no items, but with the charge still on your credit card.You have been warned."
4,Melitta Smart Mill & Brew,"For the most part, this is a good product. I love the no-mess way the beans are ground right in the maker, then the coffee is made instantly. The msn clock feature is nice, if my husband misses the weather, he has the 3-day forecast right in front of him. It is not too hard to clean, as long as you rinse out the grounds daily.The cons to this maker are:Auto shut off warmer - this is not adjustable, the maker shuts off after one-hour, which is not long enough on weekends. The only way to turn the warmer back on is to make another pot of coffee.Settings between 5-7 allow coffee grounds into the pot. They are so finely ground that they don't really bother me, but you can see the film in your cup. The lower settings are okay.If the manufacturer would fix the warmer feature, I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Scam,"As Mark Cuban said on Shark Tank, I am allergic to scams. I actually bought this as a gag gift, my boss was always harping on my negativity so he told me to go out and buy a positive bracelet so I did, LOL! But it does absolutely nothing! It's a scam!"
1,Works against Miasmas too!,"This bracelet is also proven to prevent you from becoming sick from exposure to a miasma! It also prevents autism, heart disease, Alzheimer's and cancer and if you buy one and wear it when you buy your lottery tickets you will win the powerball!"
2,Have Not Experienced Any Benefits,"Yes, they do look kind of cool. However, don't fall for the hype. After a month of wear, I have neither experienced any mitigation in aches and pains nor noticed any increase in calm. Save your 20 dollars and buy a bottle of aspirin and a couple of beers. If you must buy one, do not buy one with a white band on it. It becomes dirty looking very quickly."
3,Big and sloppy,"Coogan's history is not a page turner. He goes into excruciating detail about who fired who's sten gun first in obscure firefights long since lost to the sands of time. One wonders if Coogan by naming virtually every volunteer who ever served in the IRA did so to boost sales hoping these people or their families would buy his book. I recommend that one use this book as only a reference tool. But be mindful of the fact that Coogan is viewed as writing with a nationalist bent and that his works were even recommended reading by IRA HQ to young volunteer's in the Maze. Coogan's work which is approximately the size of a phone book could also be utilized by the RUC's CID detectives at Castlereagh or the IRA's own ""Knutting Squad"" to beat confessions out of recalcitrant prisoners."
1,I wouldn't recommend,"The kit only comes with one packet for each color. It warns that you may stain your clothes. Of course kids are going to get this on their clothes, so unless you plan to wash everything after each use, I wouldn't recommend."
2,RIP Booda Bear,"This little terry cloth bear is very cute and my dog was definitely attracted to it; however, it is not very durable. My dog tore the thing up in one day. After he ripped off the bear's nose, and chewed up one of his ears, he busted the seam open in his back. I found stuffing all over the place. I had no choice but to throw the bear in the trash. R.I.P. Booda Bear."
1,"Flat, dull, anticlimactic prose","A curious hodge-podge of ideas are aired in this collection, but McKnight's writing lacks the fire to make much of an impact with the compelling ideas. A previous reviewer was right on the money in recommending James Alan McPherson's ""Elbow Room"", a truly fabulous collection of black-themed short stories."
3,May not work for everyone,"Although Oral B Super Floss offers several features for people with braces, bridges, and other dental work, including a wide, spongy area for teeth that are further apart, I found the regular floss section to be hard to get between teeth that are close together and harsh feeling against them. The shape of the regular section is roundish, compared to the more ribbon-like, flatter Glide, which contributes to the difficulty in getting it into narrow spaces. If your teeth or gums are sensitive, or if your teeth are close together (as my molars are), I'd recommend Glide or a regular floss used with a threader instead."
5,A book for everyone to enjoy.,"The opening story in ""All Things Wise And Wonderful"", has got to be one of the best stories I've ever read. It's very touching and inspirational, but it's only the precursor of good things to come. The stories contained in this book can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. Herriot will have you laughing, crying, frustrated and just about any other emotion you can imagine as you follow him on his rounds through Darrowby. Even if you have no interest in veterinary medicine or farming, you can enjoy everything that goes on. A five-star fantastic read."
3,Short but practical,"This is a very thin book. I picked it because I read a profound statement that changed my paradigm about coaching during the book preview session. I paraphased the statement as: ""The coach is not responsible for the change, the person that receive the coaching is!"" It's the trainee's choice. I wish the book can cover more indepth information but it doesn't. Maybe, that's what I needed from this book so that I would know what I need to read next."
1,Not what it said,"I purchased this power center thinking it would be the answer to a surge protector and a power center. I was wrong!Sent it back since I lost 30% of my Hi def signal when I hooked up my cable to the center and then to the TV as was directed. Now have a Belkin surge protector which cost me 25% of what the Monster cost and it works fine.Made a poor choice, their advertising was misleading."
5,monster power center rocks!!!!!,"I purchased this monster power center on amazon for approx HALF THE PRICE compared to my local big box store. I am extrememly happy with my purchase so far and this power center seems sturdy and well built. Even my wife commented that the unit feels very heavy, which is usually a good thing in this class of electronics since heavier components mean a better grade of materials went into its construction."
5,Saved my Panasonic plasma from the blink of death,"This power strip has been faithfully powering/protecting all the electronics in our entertainment room. In our upstairs family room we have a 50"" Panasonic plasma tv that I bought a cheaper monster product to power/protect. The cheaper power strip seemed to do a good job for 16 months when suddenly the tv gave a loud crack noise and the power light began to blink. I read reviews and found others had the misfortune of this blink of death happening to their tv. I was ready to scrap the tv as the power supply was having problems per the blinking code, but on a whim decided to move the expensive monster upstairs and just give it a try powering the plasma. IT WORKED! I avoided costly repairs or possibly just tossing $1400 of plasma tv by simply plugging into this better power supply."
4,Not sure i really need to spend this much,"I use this for my TV, xbox etc. I've been having a problem with my TV a samsung LCD LN46A750 46 inch with blurriness on left side of the screen. The satellite people came and replaced all my connectors. Seems they weren't crimped on properly (you could pull them off by hand)But that made no difference in the picture. Long story short i disconnected this monster surge suppressor and it all has stopped. And i have a very clear picture with no cold start blurriness. I'll look for another but basically I just want to be able to connect a few appliances to one outlet. I'll never spend this kind of money again.This is an Update: The problem I'm having seems to not have anything to do with this suppressor.. so i updated it from 3 stars to 4.. 4 being I still don't really think i need this.. But seems to work ok"
3,Monster HTS-1000 Surge Protector,"I have owned this unit for at least 6 years, i never had a problem until about 3 months ago when it started humming. As time went buy it got so load i had to turn up the tv to hear it. I have removed it and put a cheaper BELKIN for a stop gap till i see what Monster will do. Ill update this reveiw when i hear from them to let you know the response i get. I assume a product at the time i paid over a $100 for would hold up for as long as the TV and stereo does but i guess not???"
1,"""clean power"" filter is JUNK","I got this thing because I was experiencing a hum in my stereo and also some faint horizontal interference lines on my new 46"" LCD TV. This piece of garbage did not remove any of the interference and probably just made matters worse by degrading the cable signal. I knew it sounded to good to be true..."
4,"Great, fun toy!","Boy is this a great find! Every boy out there would love this sword, or so I think. It makes wonderful fighting sounds, including clanging of two swords together, fighting swooping sounds, and all the ""grunts"" that go along with sword fighting. It also lights up which makes it incredibly fun to play with in the dark. It's pretty durable, even though it has lights and sound, it doesn't seem to be affected by heavy play and banging. This is a well-loved toy in this house and I highly recommend it!"
1,False Representation,"I wish the review stating that ""the artist playing the tunes was unknown"" had appeared before I bought this CD. Yes the tunes are recognizable as hits Kenny G has had. But, NO it's not Kenny G playing the songs. The recordings lack his mastery and fail to capture your attention. The songs sound like Musak, that is at best there good for background or white noise listening. I wanted to hear Kenny G playing these songs, so this CD was a waste of money for me."
3,Rhyming?,This book was very cute which is why I gave it such a high rating. This book is a poor example of how to rhyme. There are several lines in this book that are close to rhyming but it isn't quite there in several instances. Good for teaching counting up and backwards from ten.
4,Achievements of the Left Hand,"Co-edited by John T. Shawcross, whose synopses of the arguments and critical and bibliographical history of Milton's prose works in the Appendix would alone make it a valuable addition to any reader's shelf, this book contains a collection of essays by some of the most prominent scholars of the genre (including Profs. Shawcross and Lieb). It is a ""must read"" for anyone interested in Miltonic thought, and though out of print, will be worth the effort to locate."
5,A really wonderful adventure,This book is a great adventure and a great love story. As you read it you wonder if the author can sustain the very high level of adventure writing while doing justice to the tenderer love story. And the answer is yes. The love story is very real without being smalzy and trite while the adventure story is believable and exciting. The book is a great read and a very heartfelt tale that evokes both tears and cheers on virtually every page.
5,The most addictive Baseball sim ever,"I've played a lot of baseball sims, and have to say Baseball Mogul is the most addictive of them all. You control all front office duties for any MLB team, past or present. Other games may provide more in-game strategy options, and be more accurate statistically, but to GM a team through a number of years in one sitting is what makes BBM special.I love taking teams and stripping them down, rebuilding through the draft and trades for prospects. You can start playing your favorite team 10-15 years ago, and see if you could steer them to a better result. The drafts actually contain ""historical rookies,"" so through hindsight you might have an advantage (ie- that Albert Pujols kid might be a good draft pick).You can get the 2005 version free at their website to check it out, but at under $20, buying the new 2007 version is an incredible bargain recommended for any baseball fan."
3,Greatness comes with age,"I understand that they wanted to focus on films from all eras of adult cinema, but it's hard for me to ever see something labeled as great when it just came out two seconds ago. I guess it was ok for the price, but I would've liked to see a better job done in terms of page quality (glossy would've been nice, especially for the photos). The book could also have been bigger. I expected more from something from AVN."
5,Good music,My son is a genuine music lover so this was the perfect gift for him. He loves it. The Isley Brothers are always a good choice for good music.
4,There's something missing from this collection,"...There is a lack of ""jamming"" on this disc. The name itself would suggest a little more than the 6 minute songs that run the majority of the CD. But perhaps since these bands are so hard to catagorize Rhino felt that ""Jam Bands"" would suffice. However, I would recommend this disc to anyone who likes""stoner"" music. I would like to think of this collection as a sampler disc. But of course I take into consideration it is only Volume 1. A truly noble effort on Rhino's part to open up people to more kinds of music. Unfortunately the world DOES revolve around the Top 40. This collection eases the tension a bit. Enjoy and cheers!!!"
1,garbage album,I didn't like this album at all and the beats were terrible. Her lyrics were on point but the songs sucked. I was very disappointed especially since her first album Takin Mine is hardcore. What happened to her album that should've came out 7 years ago when she had a video for the song Do You?
4,GOOD PUNK!,"This is good ol' Oxymoron, but it's not as good as... the nineties"" This is real punk, this is good punk, and this is the way it should be played! I hope other bands will someday get the idea straight like the Oxy's did!"
4,Princess Leia Costume,"Costume worked great for our 14 month old. We bought this size b/c of reviews that said it ran big. Hat is huge though. We had to rig the back to make it smaller to fit. Belt around waist of costume was very snug. Questionable sizing, but we made it work. Adorable!"
2,wrong size!!,"...even though the package says it's for an infant, the costume is made to fit a little hippo. I can wear the head piece myself. So unless you're keen on doing some major alterations, I would skip this one."
5,No word to describe this beautiful cd,"Queen Adreena's album ""Taxidermy"" is a real pleasure to listen to. Great soft songs sometimes and rock songs. The sounds is heavy, powerfull. The imaginary circus style of the band is a + in this perfect cd. A great moment for those who like rock songs with originality. A must."
1,Weak at Best,"While the depictions of daily life in this work may be of interest those sections referring to clothing are both convoluted and misleading. Descriptions of garments worn and sumptuary laws reference few other documents then a paper written by Kathleen Kulp-Hill of which the author gives inordinate praise.For those researching Garment Construction and reproduction and practices this book provides little more than narrative of images found in the plates and at that the it is often confusing. Tunics being described as modern hunting jackets.The casual assumption that the ""Star of David"" is the symbol required by the ""Siete Partidas"" for Jewish Sumptuary clothing does not lend credence to the writers study of the corpus of Medeival Spanish or Jewish history and is alarming at best.The work is overpriced for its relative size and merit into the description of Medieval Life in Alfonso El Sabios Spain."
5,A great discovery for me !,"I didn't know anything about Purcupine Tree until a friend of mine showed me their live DVD. I was impressed by the band and decided to know them better. This is the first cd from Purcupine Tree that I bought. I can say that I love this one, every songs has its own texture, very melodic.I am always open to discover something new in music and Purcupine Tree is one of the best that I have recently made. This cd is a real jewel and you should give them a try, after three of four listening sesssion, you will discover a top class cd, full of acoutic guitars and great songs."
3,Kinda thin all around but some highlights,"There are a couple of tracks I really like, 'Baby Dream in Cellophane' and 'Stranger By the Minute'. But over all, the songs are as thin and the arrangements are as shallow as the stuff from the late 80's. I know Steve Wilson and the band can do better (and has with 'In Absentia'). You get the video to 'Piano Lesson' which is very early 90's production. The 5.1 mixes are just as boring. I'm very unimpressed and disappointed with the 5.1 mixes (but the images are pretty). Porcupine Tree is such a hit-or-miss group. They got it right with 'In Absentia' but crashed-and-burned with 'Deadwing'. I hope the next release is better."
3,Um...,"...I must be missing something. This is progressive how? I might as well be listening to The Verve or some other well-crafted BritPop.I might like it better if I didn't have such high expectations from the reviews here. Given that, maybe my impression will become more favorable over time."
4,Like Pink Like Floyd,Those who love Pink Floyd will also enjoy this album! In fact Porcupine Tree has a lot going for it as a band that is very creative in the Pink Floyd vein!
5,A CLASSIC!,"This record is a bonafide classic.I am the founder of Butt Trumpet, Bianca's first band, so maybe I am being a bit slanted here in this review. Regardless, I want to go on record saying that this is how rock-n-roll should be!It's quite toned down from Bianca's days in BT--Betty certainly went more ""rock"" than ""punk"" but the music is still filled with the anger, angst, great hooks and power that allows it to stand with some of the finest rock OR punk records ever made.You owe it to yourself to snag a copy of this at all costs! It's getting harder to find by the day. DO NOT MISS OUT!And Bianca? R.I.P. sweetie. I miss you!"
2,lorddareal,"This could have left any two tracks out due to some of the ad libbed rap that I hear on the demo. The song ""OH BOY"" as well as the laid back track ""HEY MA"" which gives him the smooth swagger that appeals to me is not even included, keep it real CAM, "" I AM """
5,Bingle Bells,"This is a retitled version of Bing Crosby's classic albumMerry Christmas. The songs are in a different order than on the original release, for some reason. But whatever order the songs are in, they are all classics. It doesn't get much better around Christmas time than hearing Der Bingle sing ""Silent Night"", ""Adeste Fideles"" and ""White Christmas"". The CD also includes three duets with the legendary Andrews Sisters, and one duet with the forgotten Carole Richards. One thing I have to question is the inclusion of ""Faith of Our Fathers"". It's a good song, but it's not a Christmas song. Regardless of that, I highly recommend this CD."
5,very enjoyable Christmas CD,"This is a classic Bing Crosby Christmas CD. Contains a great selection of songs, sung as only Bing can sing them."
4,Pretty good,"Small, durable, keyed the same... Just about everything you want from a simple lock. They will definitely not stand up to any prying or a bolt cutter, but they are really only for token security anyway."
4,Good but not GREAT!,This is a good book with a great story line and mechanics. It is so short that my son finished it in a couple hours.
5,Polar Bears!,"As soon as I destroyed my first polar bear with a siege tank I knew this would be the greatest expansion ever. I've now beaten it and, yes, I can confirm that my original conclusion still holds true after the final cutscene. Even though most of the units are the same, this feels like a whole new sequel. The story is great, the game is still beautiful, and the gameplay is unbeatable (except maybe by SC2--I haven't played enough of it yet to decide). Very much worth the time and money.Also, lurkers are my favorite units in any RTS EVER!"
1,i own it !!!,"this game is horibble i know amazon won't let others see it but if amazon lets me then people should read this i really wanted this game, then i got it i played for 2 months i hated it, it sux people! don't get this game no offense to blizzard. you should probobly get diablo 2 and the expansion diablo 2 is the best computer game i know of. if you really want starcraft than just get like warcraft frozen trone or sumthin lik dat. or u people can just wait for starcraft ghost to come out i heard starcraft ghost is going to be a big hit. so people dont get dis game plz. trust me i bought it i wasted my money on this game. so dont buy this game. ok :)"
5,Classic War Game that is FUN FUN FUN,I don't own a lot of games but those from Blizzard I really appreciate. They have a nice way of capturing the fun of playing games. I liked Diablo but didn't find a lot of replay value. This game was a lot of fun playing over and over again. Why can't more games be this well done? I don't like spending a lot of time learing to get started. This one takes off immediatly and you can continue to learn new strategies several hours later. If I had one game this would be it.
1,Dangerous,"Be very selective as to the size you get if you buy this toy. My dog choked on this and died on the way to the vet. We were right there with her when she swallowed it, but it lodged so tightly in her throat, we could not get it out. I hope this prevents someone else from suffering the terrible loss we did."
1,Bad Movies,My son likes extreme weather and was excited to get this movie pack. Even he thought the movies were terrible (he is 8). Obviously low budget movies. I guess you get what you pay for (it was like $5).
5,awesome,"Spent last year wrestling the boat on the trailer...not this year,boat goes on easily with these guides! Install is not hard at all and a fair price. I recommend these guides to anyone"
1,Bristles melt,"I got this brush on the recommendation of numerous rave reviews (makeupalley, InStyle, etc.). I tried it out this morning for the first time for a blow out, and the dang bristles melted on me. My hairdryer was on ""warm,"" and it's ionic and all, but I don't think it is unreasonably hot (my hair is still in good condition). I guess I'll use this until I melt all the bristles, but if you ask me, $20 is a bit steep for a brush I'll only use a handful of times."
5,Top Notch!,"A brilliant compilation by Dave Seaman. It's the kind of set where each CD should only be one, long, intense track. Don't pass this one up."
2,Not so good,"No looping feature, so you have to run back and forth every 5-10 minutes changing the clips. BirdSitter is a lot better if you want to keep your parrots amused."
3,Not a classic Dirk Rogers...,"I've enjoyed the Dirk Rogers stories I've read and this one is good too, but I was disappointed in the ending. I won't give anything away other than I was anxiously awaiting the conclusion of the story but the solution to the mystery was a little too Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull (a horrible movie in my opinion).Pirate Treasure of Cape May"
3,Not security envelopes,"These envelopes are fine as envelopes go, just be aware that if you are looking for actual security envelopes, as these are described, these are not your way to go. These are just plain white envelopes with no sort of security whatsoever."
3,Cintan para el cuarto de Bebe,"La cinta adhesiva decorativa para los cuartos de los niños, realmente cumplió con mis expectativas, el cuarto quedó muy lindo"
1,Poor quality!,"All together I purchased 5 BraBaby's. One broke within the first two washes, two broke within the first four washes, and the other two lasted maybe 8 months. The ones that lasted 8 months did a good job of taking care of the bra, but that doesn't do me a lot of good if they break."
3,"Came on time, but not in great condition","This book was supposed to be used and in very good condition. However, it arrived with a tattered cover and well used. There are many notes and highlight inside. I did not return the book because I didn't have time to wait for it to be replaced, but I was not entirely pleased with the condition."
4,I use mine for $$. Pills must be kept in original prescription bottle or against the law in IL,"I bought this to store a $100 bill for emergencies should I need it. It took some work to find the right folding to make it work. While the bill fit in the blue color, it did not for some reason in the black one which was the one I intended to use. It stripped the threads on the black one. There is a product out there strictly for dollar bills but it cost $14. So mission accomplished using these at 1/2 the cost and getting (6) vs (1)."
5,great for caching,I dont usually like micro caches but sometimes you do have to hide a micro these fit the bill. These have a container inside for the log that helps keep it dry.
3,Some of the interior bottles were missing,"These little aluminum capsules are supposed to have a bottle inside them. The bottle was missing in two of the ones we received.No big deal as the bottles are not needed for our use, but Ithought I would warn potential buyers.The kids loved the colors. And you cannot beat the price. The pill containers at the local drug store were $4 EACH!"
2,You either love it or hate it,"Reviewers either seem to love this book or hate it. I was one of those readers in the middle, and actually did not finish it. I got so bored with the characters that I found myself looking forward to reading that, one by one, they died. That's when you know it's time to put it down! And although I know that the author's focus was on the sisters (hence the title), it would have been nice to have a little more info about their brothers who got short shrift indeed. I actually live a couple miles from Mirador, and have always admired the beauty of the house, and wondered about the people who lived there. Now I wonder no more... self-centered, selfish, mean-spirited, and self-indulgent. Glad I didn't know them then."
3,"Good quality for the price, needs to be setup though.","I bought this guitar for my 7 year old son to learn on and I feel I need to warn people about it. The quality of the guitar is good, but you NEED to have it set up by a professional once you get it. If you don't, you are setting up your little rock and roll star for a lot of frustration.I played guitar professionally for about 15 years and the first thing I did when I pulled it out of the box was to check for ""dead frets"". This guitar had a ton of them. There was also a lot of fret buzz and the intonation was WAY off. All of these problems can be fixed pretty cheaply though, probably less than $40, if you bring it to your local guitar shop and have it professionally set up. You should factor that price in when you are comparing against other guitars.Other than the set up problems the neck was in good shape and the guitar seems pretty seems pretty sturdy over all, which is why I give it as high a rating as I did."
1,this guitar is a waste of money,"DONT BUY THIS GUITAR IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.i love guitars i rarely ever put mine done.but when i saw this guitar, it looks ok but it plays like a guitar made out of rubber bands. it is not worth the money.my advice invest a little more money in a guitar that is made better. You can also find it on this site it is the berringer v-tone guitar.IT IS A GREAT GUITAR FOR ANY STYLE OF PLAY AND ANY LEVEL OF PLAYER.this was my first guitar"
3,"It is an odd ""add on""","I ended up returning this because it just didn't make sense. My 4 year old likes to stand on the standing platform. This ""organizer"" is completely inaccessible when he's standing there. And he complains that it bangs his head. It might work for some configurations of ""passengers"" but it is really not practical for many of them."
1,Not universal for Joovy strollers!,"I bought this for our Joovy Ergo Caboose and it doesn't fit--perhaps there's fine print in the literature stating as much, but wish I had known before I went to the trouble of ordering it. Looks like a nice organizer--too bad it is going back to Amazon, and I'm going back to the drawing board."
5,Awesome product! Great sound!,"This is an amazing system that does so much! It has a USB host for an MP3 player, DivX/DVD/DVD-R/DVD-RW playback, MP3/WMA/JPEG viewer playback, XDSS extreme dynamic sound, 160W power... a one star review can't do this system justice (as the previous reviewer gave). It seemed he just reviewed on LG customer service not granting his wishes to return a product that was not defective. You won't be disappointed with this LG DVD Micro Home Theater System!"
4,"Open-minded, Mature and In Your Face: A Real Page-Turner","This is a book that doesn't judge or criticize you for looking at porn. Many of us have done it when we were young: Found Dad's porn collection somewhere; Watched (or even been caught) watching porn on the internet. This book gives you respect. Respect in opening up the industry in a no-holds-barred, completely real with real-life experiences kind of way. It shows its not a fairy-tale lifestyle (not that we thought it was), but its enough to think: Do I want to get my pleasure from other people's pain? Examples on how porn has screwed up people's lives (the actors, as well as the viewers at home) makes you think twice.Your questions will be answered."
5,bboys throwin down,"What an expensive single! However it does have a good set of songs which are of course unavailable anywhere else. I collect beastie albums so this was a must buy. not the best place to begin a beasties collection, but easily my favorite ep due to the song set and good remixes. I actually listen to this quite often in the car, on a cd-r copy of course. All in all a cool disc to have and a must buy for the true fan."
5,Vinyl Bag for Long Clothes,These are perfect. I have several very nice dusters that I wanted to keep the cats away.This product is great. My blouses not only stay clean but the cats cannot catch and snagthe material. I have three so far and I would recommend these.
2,I was disappointed in the song selection,I was disappointed that the song selection did not appeal to me near as much as the songs in Walk One vol II am 79 and work out each morning for about 40 min. WalkOne vol.1 I really enjoy exercising too. Walk One vol 2 I don't use at all. RM
4,Pretty good speakers,"I just had to replace my old Altec Lansing ACS33 speakers, which are a 3 speaker set. I was looking to find a 2 speaker set with good range and power, and these fit the bill nicely. The 3/8"" tweeter really gets the upper range nicely. Cymbals and the like are crisp, sometimes too much so. The mid-range is solid, and the bass on these is better than most 2 speaker sets in this price range. You'll have to play with your equalizer a bit for music, but they perform admirably for both that purpose and gaming.I've only had these for about a week, but so far, I'd recommend them."
5,Just what wanted,"Ilove this to put my kindle, table and smart phone in. Husband in hospital and can put everything together. Living in Florida never know during hurricane season."
4,Targus bag,"This bag is great, however, it doesn't leave much room for very much. The bag is great besides that."
5,Great Product and Super Price!!,"I bought two wallets for my husband, the brown and the burgundy. They were just what he wanted and you couldn't ask for a better product for the price we paid. Very pleased with my transaction and would not hesitate to purchase this item again."
3,Small storage capacity,"This item is ok but cannot handle my large number of cards. It also seems very difficult to remove cards when you need them. Otherwise not a bad item if you don't have alot to put in it. Lastly, i hate the zipper and wish it wasn't there."
4,OK but nothing beats KOSHER PALETTE/S.FISHBEIN,THESE RECIPES ARE OK BUT SUSIE FISHBEIN IS FOOL-PROOF. ESPECIALLY KOSHER PALETTE WHICH SHE EDITED BUT DIDN'T WRITE!
1,Should have read all the reviews all the way down first,"Like others, I've been to the retail location and it's been great.Like others, I didn't read the reviews all the way to the bottom.Like others, I've tried several recipes, several times.Like others, nothing came out right.Very disappointed.I've tried desserts from Levana's Kitchen, and everything came out great, the first time!"
1,"Very, very disappointed","Try recipes: orange cake, chocolate chip cookies, lemon meringue and lemon bars, brownie, and sugar cookies. None turns out good (the author indicates that they are the best and the favorite). I feel like something missing in the recipes. I tried some recipes twice just to make sure but got same result. NOT recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Great opera, not spiritual style I thought title suggested.","This is a very good classical collection. The rating would have been higher if the description had suggested the actual style of the music. I am giving it 3 stars because this is a very good OPERA style collection - not the spiritual style I was hoping for. Given the title and simple instruments, I thought it would be different - more relaxed. I wish a sample of the music had been available. If you want spirituals sung in an OPERA style you will love this. She is an amazing talent."
4,Another exciting Longknife adventure!,"The book is a definate must read, especially if you've read the 1st book. This book was exactly what a 2nd book should be. It built on the characters and situations introduced in the 1st book and brought in new exciting characters as well. I really liked how Nelly evolved from an expensive tool into a very interesting character. Kris's relationships with her friends and her bodyguards were really cool as well. I can't wait to see more of her and her crew. I still want to know who Abby really is and what's going on with Nelly? Hurry up Shepherd and gimme more!"
1,"Nice toy, but that's it",I was not expecting much but I just needed to find 3 surveyors pins. But even holding it directly over the exposed pins did not work. It is very good at finding metal cans.
2,NOT GOOD UNIT,DIDN'T REALLY WORK WELL AT ALL...PROBABLY NEED TO GET A MORE SENSATIVE UNIT TO REALLY DO THE JOB
5,The Best Storyteller Ever!,"Syd Wright is a great example of the spectacular people to be found in the great land of Alaska. His incredible storytelling ability brings to life a part of history and a culture that is not very well known in the world today. His expertise and love for his home is clearly shown, which adds to this wonderful film. Syd Wright makes every Alaskan proud when he tells the legacy of The Last Frontier."
5,Excellent music,"I attended the phantom.... at my local opera theater (ARgentina). I loved the music. As soon as I arrived home I ordered this CD and it doesn't dissapoint me at all, it is like being at the theater again when I listen to it. Excellent CD, the quality of the audio and the voices are beautiful. As it is the Mexican version, when I ordered it I was a bit afraid that the singers would have Mexican spanish accent, as in Argentina we have a different spanish accent, but it didn't happened, the singers use a neutral spanish, with no accent so nobody would notice if the singers are from Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay whatever spanish speaking country. I like it."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"The sound is actually good, not much effort taking into account that most recordings are digital. The translation is anything but good, accurate, or sweet. The rhymes are forced, cheap, and at times tacky, not to say tawdry.Raoul's voice is the one of an adolescent changing his pitch every now and then.Mexicans are proud of this recording, but if they were actually objective they would find out that the recording lacks elegance, majesty, poetry, grandeur, and style. Not recommended at all. An actual pity being the one and only Spanish version of the show."
5,The best theater on television!,"All the rave reviews of this series are understated, compared to how excellent this show actually is. It may be the best television I have ever watched. However I bought it for another reason. It is also an excellent primer for theater directors. Hopefully, as a director, you have a little more mental stability than poor Geoffrey Tennant. But his genus as a director is well worth watching. And for all you unfortunate actors who have suffered under directors who try to tell you exactly what to say, how to say it, where to move and what to feel, Geoffrey Tennant is such a breath of respectful, fresh air. I cannot recommend it highly enough for anyone interested in theater arts (costume, set and lighting designers will be blown away by the Macbeth.) Good Shakespeare, great television!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet (or unsweet in this case). After toiling through the intolerable entirety of this album (and believe me, I struggled and suffered dearly) I could not help but to toss it out of my window in a sudden impulse of utter disgust. I know that I really didn't give it a chance since I only listened to it once, but I was ashamed to have claimed ownership to it for the hour that I did. The rhymes were not all that bad, but I don't know what happened with the production. It sounded as if it came straight out of an '85 casio keyboard. Unless that's your style, avoid the hell out of this album. Do not take heed to the average of 3 stars that this album has received on this site. This is highly an overrating (I don't know what in god's name provoked them to give it over a one, maybe 2). I would have given it a zero or a negative one, but it wasn't an option. Don't waste the time or money (I wish I had mine back)."
5,e is for expanding,Although it contains more than its fair share of populist concepts and views it does provide an excellent insight into the expanding role of the CEO. Particularly useful were the comments of leading CEO's at some of the worlds most dynamic companies.
5,Serpa CQC Sportster Holster,"The holster from Serpa fit my Beretta 92FS like a glove. It is as described and I liked it so much, I ordered another one for my Glock 19. The paddle arrangement fits comfortably and sits high. Great holster."
4,Better,The button makes it a lot easier to release weapon. The other holsters come off my belt when I go to draw weapon
4,does the job,"Shipping and delivery were just fine, no problems with it at all.I would have given the holster 5 out of 5 because it does the job, but I was disappointed about the no rails/rails compatible part. My clone M1911 has rails, but it does not fit. It's possible that it was the wrong type of rails (I was able to remove it) so I can't blame it on the holster. I'm still using the holster, but just without the rail. Oh, I also wish the paddle was also gun metal gray. Definitely worth the money overall."
5,Serpa Sportster,"If you are looking for a VERY comfortable and secure holster, this is it! It may not conceal as well as an inside the waistband holster so you may have to modify what you wear slightly. It is adjustable(cant/angle) as well so that can help hide some ""print"". I carry a Glock 23 and couldn't be happier with this holster."
4,Not the most comfortable thing in the world,"This is not the most comfortable holster in the world, but it does the trick. The finger lock is a great safety feature and was the reason I purchased this model. All in all the positives outweigh the slight negatives."
4,"fit ? NO!, NON, NYET, NIEN","This holster does NOT fit an FNX 9. Period. Nice rig for some but not FNX9Be carefull about others' advice. You will send it back.Holler at Blackhawk, they make good stuff but not for FNX.... yet."
1,Dangerous. Avoid at all costs.,"Look it up. This product is prohibited from most shooting schools, and many military units. The design is inherently flawed in several ways, not least of which is that the release mechanism is actuated by the index (trigger) finger, and for most of these that release is inline with the trigger so when the gun comes up the user's trigger finger is under tension, and can slap the trigger. This has caused numerous NDs, many of which caused notable injury to the shooter.If that doesn't do it for you, they have a tendency to lock up when they get dirty, then you can't get the gun out, at all. Tools, time and a workbench are required.Avoid at all costs."
2,"not sure what happened with the quality of this holster, its bad","I ordered 3 serpa holsters, two were the grey cqc and they are great quality, but this one is terrible, I had to use a exacto knife to shave off the left over molding tags around the whole holster. I also had to shave off a sharp area right where my finger pushes the lock in. Not sure what happened, i did notice the seller (Online Tactical Store LLC) has several people saying they are selling counterfiets and fakes on other products!! They also shipped this poc in a freaking zip lock bag and claimed it was new!!!!!!!!!!! Serpa is great quality usually for the price. I had to order another holster to replace this poc one."
3,"Book OK, but should you trust it?","This book did provide some useful information, but seeing that Dr. Nozawa's license was suspended (see http://www.doh.wa.gov/Publicat/99_News/99-45.html), it is hard for me to take his book seriously."
4,Nice lime green,i Like it turned out awsome I used it on metal tho but I'm using a clear coat over it.
2,"Well written, nothing new.","Wolff is a fine writer, and the book is certainly readable, but it added barely anything to my understanding of war, Vietnam, the soldier's life, etc. Frankly, I was disappointed, based on the previous work I'd read by him. Other Vietnam books, such as ""Chickenhawk"", ""The Things They Carried"" (the latter billed as fiction) and ""We Were Soldiers Once, And Young"" really put this one to shame, and I strongly recommend all of them, without reservation, to anyone who might be interested in this subject. This one you can skip."
3,"not as good as ""This Boy's Life""","Pretty uneven, but there's quite a few good belly laughs to be had here.This one is not nearly as good as ""This Boy's Life"", the narrator seems way too distant from his own life. Writing ""coolly"" about your life is a tough balancing act. On the one hand, you make the stories quick and easy to disgest, but on the other, you surrender a lot of authority to tell your own story.Overall, this is a little too close to Dave Barry or Erma Bombeck, but it's still well worth reading."
5,Excellent condition,This book arrived in Excellent condition I mean it looked brand new.. More then I expected...The price for this book was economical and exactly what I was looking for..The shipping was quick and I knew where my book was every shipping day.
4,Does the job,"This stuff is pretty good. Yeah my mouth feels real fresh after using this stuff. What it does with the germs, I don't know. Its a little strong so kids might not find it too nice."
5,One of my long lost favorites...,"When I was 14 I saw this movie for the first time on cable. I loved the score from the movie but I forgot all about it. Now 6 years later I have it. The score is very touching and can be militaryish. I tip my hat to Robert Folk for putting together such a great score. Very underrated for it's time. Anyone who likes Robert Folk's scores, should consider buying this. Although it is very rare now. You can try looking for it on ebay. I've gotten more rare soundtrack's from there then I have here."
4,Good choice,"Very good for relaxing and meditating !I strongly recommend this album, probably the best of Coxon.Enjoy these fine collection."
1,great to read out loud on helium,A landmark work for those charting Sallis' decay from solid Plato commentator to Pope of SPEP/Perugia farce. The introductory section stakes Sallis' claim to be the worst unintentional parodist of Derrida's style. It's so perfectly funny that my friends and I would sometimes read it aloud after inhaling helium or speak it through a fan on high setting. Why did we do it? Try reading the book _without_ these distortions and see if YOU can keep a straight face!
4,Told me what I needed to know.,"This book is written by the author and quite frankly is his way of paying himself back for his hard work. Bottom line is if this documentation came with the program, we wouldn't need to buy the book. The bulk of the useful stuff takes up one third of the book. The rest is historical crao that I cared less about. Anyway, thanks to the book, I could get PGP up and running on an MVS and NT server."
1,Pure garbage.,"Disregarding the fact that I wouldn't eat the foods from the recipes if I were being paid, as ""A Customer"" has noted, the characters in this book are all one dimensional cardboard cut-outs. There is very little to distinguish one from the other. Everyone in this book acts as if they hate God's guts.I have another 72 pages to go before I finish the book. I'll try, but I don't know if I can make it to the end."
3,Super Reader,"Novelization of the fantasy movie, which is pretty much a B movie, but entertaining enough with your Robert E. Howard style of vile wizard present."
5,Mahk Jchi,The most amazing music I have heard in a long time. The blending of voices and the music absolutely took my breath away. Awesome!
5,Excelente lubricante !!!,"Este producto lo hemos estado usando por un largo periodo de tiempo, siempre procuro tenerlo en el cajon de mi buro de noche, mi esposa esta muy satisfecha con el y, si mi esposa esta satisfecha, claro que yo tambien !!!"
4,None compare!,K-Y is a firm favorite of mine. Probably the best lube I have ever used and I can assure you I have worked my way through quite a few tubes of many different brands over the years. None compare!
4,great time,"easy to use, great feeling. slippery and sensual for that quickie in the afternoon or in the park. cheaper than the brick and mortar and last for a long time."
1,Too general,"This book does not really deal with passive aggression at all. It meanders all over the place, never gets to the point and mentions passive aggression only occasionally in passing. Thank God I read a library copy. If I'd wasted money on it I would be furious!"
2,It is what is says it is Passive aggresive,"I bought this book for my husband, who is for sure passive aggressive. He read it in two days flat and was irritated. Said the book didnt give a single helpful anything. It was very good at describing what it means to be passsive agressive but it gives no practical ways of helping resolve the problem or even begin working on it. This book goes right to the recycle bin. My husband felt it was not helpful in any way outside of describig the actual problem itself. He aslo says it is extremely repetive and that checking it out from the library would have been much better since it is a wast of money. Sorry folks, but please dont buy. Sorry for any typos but I have a serious trouble seeing. Try a book called Transforming Anger by Doc. Childre. My husband says its a much smaller book, but has much deeper and thought provoking information. This seems good to me. Good luck all."
2,not too bad for a foreign erotic movie...,"there was some nice stuff in this movie, such as the nudity and the erotic situations. but as a film, it was lacking. if you like this sexy actress then i recommend Thriller: A Cruel Picture. that has the best of both worlds: sex and a good story.the ending wasn't really satisfying either. how was she cured again? some girl on girl experience? maybe it was buried deeper and i missed it?Anita was ok, but that's about it.D"
2,Bad Amazon Suggestion,"This was suggested to buy with Cashback, and i figured it would be similarly artistic and not some skin flick as the covers of both movies suggested. No. This was a weird softcore porn, really. Not recommended to anyone. The DVD was bad quality and the movie was terribly silly."
1,don't waste your money,"i have pretty bad dry mouth due to medications that i can't stop. so, like everyone, i saw the commercial and was like, wow!yeah, turns out, not so wow. the mouthwash actually makes my mouth dryer. the spray only works for a few minutes and both taste horrible. i'll keep looking for a better product. in the meantime i'll stick to cinnamon mints, they seem to work much better and are much cheaper/tastier. (cinnamon and mints help the glands produce saliva)"
4,More Than You Expect,"By the time Three Dog Night released this album you didn't know what to expect from a band that has kept it alive for so long. They made a huge comeback on this album to prove that they weren't going anywhere. Lots of great songs here. ""Black and White"" and ""Pieces Of April"" were the hits but you gotta check out the Marvin Gaye remake ""Chained"" and the Rare Earth remake of ""In Bed"". The track ""Going In Circles"" is from the film X Y and Z which was not memorable but a good song and ""Midnight Runaway"" finishes the album off."
5,Worth Getting,"This box set is well worth the $$$. In reading other reviews this set may not have every single song the group released, but it contains just about everything. The sound quality is great. Being a record collector of over 20,000 in vinyl I highly recommend this for an avid collector. It's worth it for the enhanced sound quality alone. That's where you can bank on you $$$. If you want the missing songs from this collection just search for another set that will have them."
4,Worthy Sophomore Album,"Killers is Iron Maiden's second offering, and is solid throughout. While I like the debut album a tad better, this album still resonates with me. The musicianship on the album is probably a little better and more complex than it's predecessor, but I prefer the songs on the first album. I'm only comparing this album to the first for the simple fact that these two are the only releases with Paul Di'Anno on vocals. On its own, this album is still good, with such standout tracks such as WRATHCHILD, GENGHIS KHAN, KILLERS, PRODIGAL SON, and PURGATORY. I particularly like PRODIGAL SON, as it's easily the most different sounding track. WRATHCHILD is a favorite, too. This album closes the Di'Anno era, but lays the groundwork for the Dickinson era that would soon follow. 7.5/10"
1,dumb,"As a non-metal listener, this is astoundingly bad tripe. It comes across as some has been 80's music that in reality, should have no listeners. But, since metal is the breeding ground of the inarticulate, it receives heaps of praises, namely from long haired boneheads who never grew up, holding on to some idiotic glorious metal past. Rotten guitars, corny lyrics, a guy who sings like the cross between Fleetwood Mac and Cher, should I go on?Just dump this in the ""do not buy"" bin. It's terrible."
1,Not A Romance Novel,"To romance lovers attention...this is NOT a romance novel. This is story of a woman through her life. If you like these kinds of stories, then read this, but if want to read a romance novel this isn't for you. I love Lisa Kleypas, but this book just doesn't fit the genre that she is known for. The main characters in this are boring and dull. I don't really care for the message that Liberty's ""friends"" put out about finding a rich man....married or not...and latch on to them to get what you want, but in return you give them sex. Yeah it really doesn't scream independent woman. Gage isn't even in the book till around the end, so you really don't get a love story with Liberty and him. Which is why I didn't really believe their ""love."" I will tell you to give the other two book in this series a try Blue-Eyed Devil and Smooth Talking Stranger...those two have more romance and love in it vs. this one."
5,I loved it!!,"Lias Kleypas's historicals are in a league of their own and I'm a huge fan but I loved this book too. There is something about this story and the characters that will touch and move you deeply. Liberty was a very mature character who took on life and handled it better than any adult in her situation. Lot of people complained about the writing in first person. Honestly, for me it didn't take away anything from the story and I still felt all the emotions, the heartbreak, the angst and ofcourse, the romance. I only wish there was more of her romance in there. I won't talk about the hero incase I give something out but I would highly recommend this book especially for romance lovers and maybe you will be surprised! Next up is her Blue Eyed Devil and I can't wait!"
3,Not what I expected,"I agree with the review by Avid Reader - this book wasnt what I expected. It was ok - I am a big fan of Lisa Kleypas - but it wasnt great, just ok. The beginning of the book was just too much about the main character's childhood to adulthood, I got very bored with that part and then found myself skimming through it until she got older and the romance part of the book started. By that time though, I had skimmed through so much of it that I ""lost"" who the character was and wasnt able to connect with her later on - as a result, I lost interest in the story along the way. I just didnt enjoy this book as much as I was anticipating I would. It just didnt have the typical Kleypas ""fire"" that her other works have had."
4,DISAPPOINTED IN LISA'S NEW BOOK,This is a good story but I was disappointed in 2 things in Kleypas'new contemporary. First was the use of the first person. I just findit annoying. The second was my disappointment with the ending. HardyCates should have got the girl instead of Gage who I found to be a total bore!
2,"Fast reading fluff. To much ""Texans are Cosompolitan"" too.","This book was a C read for me. I flew through it. Didn't take a lot of brain power. Good fluff for the masses. Started out interesting enough. Would have liked it better if so much of the book wasn't spent telling me how much Texans are misunderstood.Also, I hardly think a New Yorker would fly to Texas to get a haircut. That is pushing it. Texas is not New York City, not even close."
3,3.5* Its exciting when Liberty met Gage...,"I do a lot of skipping the page in the middle part of the book, but once Liberty meet Gage the romance begin to be very exciting. I very much enjoy they relationship Liberty-Gage-Hardy (one Heroine vs 2 Heroes), I seldom found it in a romance novel. It seem just like seeing a Romance movie or Korean Drama series...As for my conclusion, this book has an unforgetable, magnificent story & (love-making esp. in the limo), ...however I wish its a bit longer. I should have not bought this book after all..."
3,Perfect hero and perfect heroine make for an imperfect book!,"I generally really Lisa Kleypas books. I love when her heros are imperfect and her heroines are similarly imperfect and somehow they just fit perfectly. In this case, Liberty Jones is gorgeous and so naturally wonderful that, even though she grew up in a trailer park, she can just waltz in and mix with the super-rich elite, no problem. No class issues, no social mis-steps, nothing! Just knows exactly how to dress down to her Stewart Weitzman shoes (because every working gal has to have her 300 dollar shoes!)And then we get to Gage -- another perfect specimen of humanity. Everything he does, he does superbly, better than anyone else! He went to the best schools and excelled at all of them, and who should he chose for his lady love? Why, his dad's manicurist, of course!Anyway, that being said, Lisa K is a great storyteller and the book is a decent read. Nowhere near as good as some of her other books, but still entertaining."
3,It was okay. The first half was a little too stretched,"the first half of the book was a bit too stretched. In a romance novel, you want to get to the romance as quick as possible. You really don't need see the character grow up from a 14 yr old girl to a 24 yr old. I liked the half where Liberty was grown and with gage, I just wish that had been the focus of the story rather than the end of it."
2,Static!,"I learned that Stravinsky lived in many places. He had an affair with Coco Chanel. He didn't like others to hear him composing.Still, this work was quite dull. He lived in a time of moving images, yet all one sees here are photos of him. They show moving images of the places where he lived, but that wasn't enough. The narrator had a boring voice. You can't show this to a high school music class because they'll sleep through it.Further, the work never says what composition made him famous. It seemed like out of nowhere, he was a celebrity. I wish this had said more about ""The Rites of Spring"" and the Ballets Russes."
1,Seurat Afternoon Jigsaw Puzzle 1000 pc,"After assembling the frame, my wife & I threw the puzzle away. It was so poorly cut, the pieces were virtually interchangeable. Never again from that manufacturer!"
1,I Can't Believe Sombody Published This,"What kind of songs are these? I mean, come on. Who in there right mind would buy this CD? Just look at the titles. I've never heard this CD, but there is no way I would buy it. Hey, I'm not telling you not to buy this. If you want it, by all means, buy it. I'm just saying look at product and see if it's worth your money. I apoligize if you somehow found this article demeaning and offensive. Thanks."
2,Tiny. Not what I expected.,"Not happy with the size of this. It may be to scale, but for the price, it is a waste of money!"
3,"decent, but somewhat outdated","This camping guide was okay, but is getting outdated. It was done in 2005, and some of the campgrounds have changed significantly since then. (Lake Cascade's Ridgeview now has hookups). Not a lot of detail on road conditions. No information on any private campgrounds, so most of this you could find online with a trip to the Forest Service and State Parks websites. If you are camping in Southwest Idaho, there is an Idaho Statesman camping guide that has a lot more information and details and came out in 2009, so it's much more up to date."
2,Not as expected,"Not bad, I got a light blue one not as in the picture.I did not find it perfiect for wii."
5,"Good, just wish it was cheaper.",These were really good. The box came with 10 small packs of cookies. The tasted like chocolate chip cookies to me.. a cookie on the outside and delicious creamy chocolate on the inside. Each cookie has a picture of a panda doing some kind of sport. I just wish the price or the shipping would be lower. It comes out being almost $10 for a box. =\
4,"It's called a *single*, silly","This is a short CD because it's actually an expanded version of a 7"" single (remember those?). And it's good, like pretty much everything Big Sandy puts out. Wahoo!"
3,Pity...,"This album could have been much greater if Mason had had the modesty to recognise that Elliot's voice was much superior to his. It's a pity listening to Elliot doing backing-vocals to Mason's inexpressive solo attempts. It should be the other way round: Elliot going solo and Mason backing her.Anyway, some of the songs are nice enough and it's always a great pleasure listening to Elliot, even when she is allowed just one solo track. Well, nothing is perefect..."
4,Great Item!,Some very good breath spray. A single spray lasts roughly an hour and tastes great. Very convenient and a very good price with the free shipping.The only drawback is when placing the bottle in your jean pocket lint and fibers get underneath the cap and have to be cleaned out with each use.
3,Ow!,"I bought this stuff because I'm doing the Ideal Protein diet and it's the only sugar (and sugar-alcohol) free breath spray on the market. I was hoping it would work great and taste decent. While the taste IS decent, it also burns my tongue if I'm not careful to spray it toward the back of my mouth. It fixes my breath for 10-30 minutes before I need another spritz. (Yeah, bad breath is a side effect of Ideal Protein.) Overall, not great but not horrible. I don't feel like I wasted money on it."

2,Library Pedantry,"More than 400 pages of detail on virtually every aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) as computers monitor and record human use of them is far too much. It doesn't help that Peters, unlike most other commentators, is an apologist who finds little to fear from the invasion of privacy that is an essential part of HCI. This may be the first comprehensive overview of the topic but it could have benefited from some serious editing to produce a shorter and less pedantic text. Most readers will find this hard going."
3,"Concert is wonderful, sound quailty is not!","The television broadcast had better sound quality than the dvd. Unfortunately, the producers did not do justice to this excellent concert. The dvd seems like a recording of a recording and virtually has no extra features."
5,incredible,The quality of the video is matched only by the quality of Andrea's voice. Every song is a thrill
5,great service,"The delivery was on time, The conditions of my product were intact, and I was really please with the service."
1,expected more,quality wasnt great couple good songs thats it i thought it would be alot better ive seen him on tv and it was much better
3,"Good, but not great","Overall, this brief biography offers an interesting portrait of a commanding political figure of the Victorian era. In order to fully appreciate Smith's rendition, however, one should become acquainted with (if not actually reading) Disraeli's novels, as his writing seems to be Smith's point of departure, and frequent point of reference in telling the story of Disraeli's life. I, for one, was less interested in linking the biographical themes in Disraeli's novels to his life's events, and more interested in capturing the essence of the epoch, with more detail and attention paid to the political developments of Disraeli's age."
5,I love this stuff!,This is the only chapstick type lip product that I like! I hate the fact that I can't find it in stores anymore
5,Thank goodness you had it,"I have used Daily Conditioning Treatment for 13 years. In the past two years, it hasn't been easy to find. I recently talked to the pharmacist at our local Walgreens, and she said that Walgreens corporate office had decided not to carry it anymore. I went into panic mode, because I love everything about DCT. I searched high and low for a similar product to no avail. I like the texture, it stays on well, and it has an SPF of 20.I finally decided to search Amazon.com, and THANK GOODNESS they had it. So I bought two boxes! I am a happy customer."
3,"The British David, not the 'Canadian' David","It appears that many people think this is the David Foster of ""St. Elmo's Fire"" fame, who released keyboard/orchestral music...It is NOT.This is the David Foster that was part of the same group (the Warriors) as Jon Anderson of YES fame, and eventually went on to form the band FLASH with Peter Banks (also of YES fame.) He is the co-writer of a few YES songs (hence the re-make found here)That being said, I must say that the album is somewhat bland... not bad, but nothing spectacular either; and certainly NOT the same romantic/majestic piano player many people seem to be confusing him with!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This album is hardly recognizable as David Foster. If you like the ""modern"" style you've come to enjoy over his previous albums, this won't be a favorite. It's a totally different style with vocals backed up by a very plain, weak musical score.I have really enjoyed all the other David Foster albums, and this one does not even belong in the same category."
3,Don't Try to Fly,"This is, overall, a great game. However, I have an iMac. Following some advice from the Internet I bought a Logitech 3D Extreme Joystick. It is very difficult to fly the planes with a mouse. The engine is either on or off, and pulling out of a dive takes so many mouse swipes you frequently crash. My iMac won't recognized the Logitech joystick (although the vendor assured me it would). I called ASPYR and they told me the game cannot be played with a joystick. I called Logitech. After three tries, and only one answer (total 57 minutes listening to ""please hold"") a nice person tried to help me and failed to get anywhere at all. He advised I buy something called USB Overdrive, a program that supposed interfaces between all joysticks and all computers. Didn't work. Overdrive USB has taken their email off their site (too much spam) and doesn't give a phone number.So. It's a very good game, but don't expect to fly a plane with any luck at all."
4,Great Multiplayer Action,"Even though it's showing its age, Battlefield 1942 is still a great multiplayer experience. I hust bought a new iMac G5 and my PC friends still wanted to game with me. After I installed the Desert Combat 0.7 modification we were off and playing online again. The only real issue is that even with a 2.0 Ghz G5 and 1.5 GB of RAM, it struggles against 49 bots on an enemy team. Just play online against humans or keep the bot count a bit lower. I like the ability to play with my Windows using friends."
3,Battlefield 1942,"I enjoyed the simpified run and shoot arcade game because it was good practice for more advanced games like Halo, Medal of Honor and Call of Duty Modern Warfare.I realize that this game is rather old in comparison to the others. I wonder if there is an upgraded version with more realistic visuals and movements."
3,Not used often,I got this book for a class I'm in but it turns out that maybe I shouldn't have gotten it after all. I haven't even opened it and we only have a month left
1,i will sooner or later rusted,i got it i had many hot working days after 3 months it just completly rusted and it is good for cold weather reigons
3,Pleasant Diversion,"This was a basically entertainng read. It had at least 3 or more memorable characters. There was alot of disjonted flow in the novel, but for the most part it held one's attention. I liked the fact that the two of the main characters never changed up, William and Ramsey. The others flipped flopped alot in their positions and dispositions. Some of the situations were a bit unrealistic to me, but again, made the read pleasurable. All in all I enjoyed Stone's Revenge."
1,please...no...,"i guess i read a different book from most everyone here b/c i really didn't enjoy this. at first i respected william. he cam from a difficult background but then he takes everything and ruins it by raping the girl. and the fact that she is okay with it makes me sick. this book was a disappointment b/c if really did have potential but that was all messed up with the rape. and it WAS RAPE, there is NOTHING romantic about that."
1,Don't Bother,"This may be the best game in the world but I wouldn't know. The game would not run on my system (P4 1.7 with 64MB video card and 256MB memory on Window Me) and after contacting tech support via email, I got one suggestion (which didn't work) After that, I have been ignored by their tech support. Take your chances with this one. If it doesn't work properly, you are on your own. Don't count on their tech support!"
3,Scholarly text,"A scholarly text that explores ways to bring Christianity back into fundraising. It is based on a two-year study of 7 Christian organizations (none of them parishes). It is not about the ""how to"" of fundraising but rather the ""what if.""Not as useful for parish work as ""Behind the Stained Glass Window"" or ""Giving and Stewardship in an Effective Church."""
2,us it up quick,"I bought this product tear mender crafter kit. Don't buy unless you have 400 uses. It works well for one year then after that the product starts to thicken and won't mix and eventually you get a big glob and you have to discard all of the unused product. If you peel the lable back it discloses this information very tiny on the bottom . Also be very careful when appling if it gets on any other area it will not come off, except your hands.If you do purchase it only buy the smallest bottle otherwise you will be wasting your money, like I did !"
5,Another Top Australian Band!,"Madison Avenue's hit single 'Don't Call Me Baby' has a groovy beat and definitely makes you want to get up and dance. The lead vocal is very hip, lyrics are catchy and it is easy to see why it has hit the Australian charts on a high. Definitely worth a listen, you'll be dancing all the way from the store!"
5,I LOVE this single!,"I absolutely LOVE this single from Madison Avenue! It is absolutely goes off! And if you like this single, you should listen to Madison Avenue's newest smash hit ""Who the hell are you"" It is absolutely GREAT! Get it now."
5,"vote, and vote, and vote.","the great SEA MONSTER band just played a month ago at the MAX'S KANSAS CITY REUNION CONCERT at BOWERY ELECTRIC. the band is based on LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK and what a plus they are for not only LONG ISLAND music, but more important for rock n roll history altogether. if you have never heard a note these guys have made over their long career, buy this cd and it will be a start of something new and wonderful in your empty brain. SEA MONSTER have also released a brand new cd, of which i now own. began ownership while at MAX'S REUNION CONCERT day 1, a thursday night, of 4 days of music, and good drinking, and meeting old friends you had not seen in 20+ years. amazing when a band like SEA MONSTER can inspire one to have such a life altering experience."
3,Not the right tour,"If you are buying this, wanting to hear the tour the Creatures did in 1999, then don't buy this album. It is from the Zulu tour of 1998, and does not even sound remotely like many of the album cuts. It is good, and it is neat hearing Siouxsie with brass backup, but it is not from the Anima Animus tour. Just to warn any potential buyers."
5,Absolutely invaluable,"I'm in the process of reviewing 2D texture creation books for 3D programs, specifically Second Life's platform, and this book is by far the best I've found out there so far.The tutorials concentrate on developing textures from scratch, along a detailed workflow like you would set up on a typical project, and the final quality of the textures created is top notch professional grade.While other books seem to lack in quality, concentrate too much on one specific app for the final textures, or throw in way too much concept and not enough practicality, this book strikes a perfect balance between concept and execution. The book is intelligent without being overabsorbed, and is full of fantastic information. A great read and an invaluable reference book alike. Pick this one up!"
5,A key acquisition: very highly recommended as a foundation title for any video gaming library,"3D Game Textures: Create Professional Game Art Using Photoshop is a 'must' for any library catering to game developers, and gamers working with computer graphics. All the Photoshop texture options are covered in a collection of texturing techniques key to aspiring video game creators. Updated to cover shader technology and adding new chapters on shaders, world building and terrain editing, a companion DVD includes sample textures, Photoshop brushes and more. A key acquisition: very highly recommended as a foundation title for any video gaming library."
4,Blistex Lip Medex is a great product for ...,"Blistex Lip Medex is a great product for relieving dry, cracked lips. It has the consistency of petroleum jelly and comes in a pot. What's particularly good about it is that it doesn't have the strong, camphor odor and taste as the regular Blistex in a tube. But it's as soothing and provides the same quick relief. I'll definitely purchase this product again."
5,Been using it for about 20 years.,"My only complaint is that it only comes in a jar-type container, which can be unsanitary. I live with my dad, who also uses this with his big man hands so whenever I find an opened jar around the house I pop it in the microwave for about a 30 seconds before using it, just to kill off any bacteria and make it look nice and even in the jar."
2,Falls flat on its face!,"An English novel to the core. ""Amsterdam"" is a book of Shakespearean proportions. The author's urbane narrative force walks the reader through what is structurally a primitive tableau. After a quick ""mise en place"", the actors are set in motion and this modern tragicomedy unfolds. The story is resolved to true English modal-- a rendering of accounts. ""What consummate artistry!""The issue here takes the form of a question: Can the basic structure of the ancient and primitive Shakespearean tragedy provide a relevant narrative format for today's literature? It is a matter of taste. My quick answer is NO. In my view, the Shakespearean format is always superseded by the narrative markers. In a novel, the tragedy will drive the actors off a cliff but the narrative will restore the resolution which is antithetical to the Shakespearean tragedy. Perhaps an English innovation as a modern work-around to a primitive condition where a black horse prevails. So... two-stars."
2,Two thirds of a good book,"I greatly enjoyed the first two-thirds of this book. The denouement, however, is highly contrived, with the characters' actions being dictated by the needs of the plot rather than by the personal characteristics which McEwan has attributed to them. McEwan may have intended this as a parallel to a development in the plot, but if he did he's still wasting our time."
2,Booker Prize?,"Be weary of this plot-driven novel. McEwan offers little by way of metaphysics and fails to emerge as a writer with a vision. In this era of neo-Hemingways, McEwan has established himself as nothing more than this: a plain, credible author--an author with plot and plot only. That this text won the Booker Prize is shocking."
3,"Well-written, hard to put down, but predictable ending.","McEwan clearly has a talent for crafting words into prose that flows easily and with grace, but I found the substance of the plot lacking. I found the much hyped unexpected climax predictable. I had it figured out not even halfway through. Altogether though despite the weakness of the ending, the book was hard to put down and enjoyable largely due to McEwan's writing."
3,Great Style With Empty Emotion,I read Amsterdam shortly after Enduring Love and had the same reaction to both books. The author has an incredibly gifted style of writing. Both books grabbed me from the start. Both books lost steam as the stories progressed and I struggled to find characters I cared about. Both books left me feeling empty by the end. I wanted to like both books but the great style couldn't overcome the lack of emotive substance for me.
2,Amster-Amster-dam-dam-dam,"Ian McEwan's small comedy is about as engaging and carefully constructed as the campfire song. The humor is thin, forced, and entirely dependent on schadenfreude. The plot follows the mutual self-destruction of two members of the British intellectual class, an accidental editor and a pre-modern composer. But really the demise of any of the other characters - all equally conventional, egotistical, and empty-headed - would be equally entertaining. Fortunately, the book is short and the vocabulary is shallow, so the reading experience is mercifully quick."
2,A disappointment,"I'd been looking forward to AMSTERDAM since reading ENDURING LOVE and hearing that it won the Booker Prize. In addition to being somewhat slim and lightweight as a novel, I'm sorry to say that at the end it turns into a one-joke story (and that joke, while inventive, is so wholly preposterous that it cheapened the rest of the novel). AMSTERDAM had a great beginning but fails to deliver on its promise."
1,disappointing,"I can't believe this won a Booker. I suppose it was well written, but the story was awful. It could have easily been a made-for-tv movie."
2,"Greatly Marred by Lazy, Implausible Ending","Ian McEwan is Britain's leading literary artist, so anything he publishes should be greeted with enthusiasm. However, this is a disappointment. This is a story of two men: one is a composer, Clive Linley, who is busy writing a symphony; and the other is a newspaper editor, Vernon Halliday, who publishes a series of photos in order to ruin a right-wing politician's career. A mutual lover, Molly Lane, who has since died, took the pictures. To publish them, Linley believes, would be to besmirch the memory of Molly Lane, whom they both loved. They fall out and their friendship sours; eventually, after a series of misunderstandings, themselves plot contrivances, turning to hatred. I won't give away the ending. I will only say that it is ridiculous. McEwan should read more Ian Banks to see how to develop clever but plausible twists to his endings. Failing that, just read a couple of Agatha Christies."
3,"Can't say I love it, but it'll pass","It just might pass as a Booker Prize Award winning novel, short sweet, disturbing and most of all, pompous in English. Aren't these the criteria in winning one?OKay seriously, I think this is a pretty haughty novel that it might just not able to be grasped by the lower society. This aristocity novel provided a willful glimsped into the European political and satirical scenes where betrayal seemed to be the only logic among the Englishman. A sacred heart to confess, this novel ain't that good, but will do for light reading, sauntering like strolling into a garden and before you know it, you're out.Blunt. Dull. But it's okay."
2,Snooker Prize,"Gotcha! McEwan's novel, while it has its good points, does not rise to the level of other Booker Prize winners. The characters are unconvincing and underdeveloped--trite even. We may be pleased to see wretched evilness unveiled in ordinary men, but this is a novel I might have found along with other pulp fiction disasters. The author must have some unusual sway and powers of persuasion to have garnered such kudos from otherwise reliable and trusted reviewers."
4,A superb comic vise,"Clive nor Vernon initiates the euthensasia pact and Garmony certainly does not come out on top. And no one mentions how funny and acidly satiric it is, chiefly as a study of the media and the middle-aged decline of '60s idealists. The ending is obvious, true, and cruel, but so are the endings of Waugh's Handful of Dust and Huxley's Genius and the Goddess, with which Amsterdam stands comparison as a small comic masterpiece."
2,what is all the fuss about?,"A story of two rich liberal morons (RLM) written by another RLM, critically acclaimed by a whole bunch of RLMs. It is readable though."
2,Left me nonplussed,"Yes, the writing is good. And yes, McEwan can definitely weave a plot that pulls the reader along willingly. But somehow I think I must have missed the point.AMSTERDAM begins when two friends, Vernon and Clive, meet at the funeral of Molly, their mutual ex-lover. They reminisce a bit, and begin to rekindle their friendship. When Vernon, a newspaper editor, makes a decision to publish some damaging information about another ex-lover of Molly's, Clive is disgusted. Their friendship unravels and spirals downward toward an ending so ridiculous that though you can see it coming, you can&#65533;t believe that McEwan is really going to take you there.Not quite funny enough to be darkly comic, and not quite serious enough to be a morality tale&#65533;I&#65533;m not sure what this book is."
1,Why did this book win the Booker Prize?,"I picked this book up after reading The God of Small Things (which I loved), thinking that another Booker Prize winner would be worth checking out. But Amsterdam was really a bore: loathsome characters, predictable and idiotic plot turns, and basically nothing at all enlightening or thought-provoking. A genuine disappointment whose only redeeming quality in my opinion was that it was under 200 pages long."
1,one star is generous,"How to make a laughing stock of literary awards? What possessed the Booker committee to award this unoriginal, lightweight collection of unthoughtful rambling their top honour??Mr McEwan may well have a better body of work to his credit, but I bought this book since ""Winner of the Booker prize"" usually affords me unabridged reading pleasure.Instead I feel cheated - you get a predictable and downright dull regurgitation of the old Tory-baiting, kneejerk-reactionary 1980's backlash. Set in the mind of a conceited composer and populist broadsheet editor we are not even afforded the luxury of character depth to paint over the lack of a biting storyline. And the prose is tired, jaded and doesn't know where to jump and bore the reader next.Oh yeah - the ending is so predictable. Perhaps I'll have to be more selective in judging Booker prize winners in the future, but I'll allow anyone one such glaring error."
3,Guilty Pleasure for the Literate,"At one point Clive asks himself 'when does an artist abandon his high intentions and go for fame or the quick buck?' With this book, McEwan seems to answer his own self-conscious question: 'somewhere around chapter five'.There is nothing wrong with Amsterdam. It holds your attention and is a fine quick read. McEwan, however, is plainly capable of better.Until the final chapter, when the narrative moves to Amsterdam, the novel's value is derived precisely from its intelligence and subtle insights into art, capitalism, friendship, and betrayal. (The first hundred or so pages tackle the theme of ""the double"" as well as anything I've read post Dostoyevsky.) Unfortunately, the finale makes clear that McEwan's work amounts only to a superior telling of an inferior story.The tragedy of Amsterdam is not merely the conniving and contrived fates of the protagonists: It is, more acutely, the author's betrayal of his own intelligence."
3,Where is the beef,"This is really a long short story. As a novel it does not quite satiate. Its climax is cynical to the max, but does not really follow up on th build-up. A surprising choice for the Booker prize"
2,Not TOO MUCH of a waste of time.,"I guess it must be the fact the I borrowed the copy that said this was a ""Booker Prize"" winner that kept me going on till the end. The book isn't wholly bad. The writing is elegant at times; when McEwan describes one of the characters (I can't remember the name anymore) on a train journey and a hike.But, other than that, I don't remember anything except the ending. THIS IS A SPOILER. The two characters are in Amsterdam and they both manage to lay their hands on some drugs and they poison each other's drinks. HOW silly is that? It's a total disappointment to have started off thinking hey this seems like a serious plot, and then McEwan goes and does something like that. It's too unbelievable, the ending. The characterisation become more and more naive and coerced towards the lame end. Thank goodness it was all so brief.Glad I didn't pay money for it. Oh, and I must add, why are the Booker Prize winners always such disappointments?"
3,A Too-Easy Ending,"Unfamiliar with Ian McEwan, I was somewhat disappointed by this highly-hyped award winner. Although the prose was tight and the slightly mocking tone of the narrator was fun, neither the story nor the characters quite jelled for me.There were also too many unanswered questions regarding the ending. Where would an isolated, world-famous composer find a murderous doctor in another country? Perhaps it would be easier for the newspaper editor, but with his name splashed all over the media one would think that he would have trouble making this illicit contact also. It was all too pat and rather rushed, like McEwan just wanted to get it over with.Worth reading, but not memorable."
2,Worthy of the Booker? Definitely not.,"Ian McEwan is undoubtedly an excellent writer. His sentences are beautifully crafted and the pace of this story never falters. But my overwhelming feeling at the end was, ""So what? Why should I care about these people""? And why, frankly, did Mr McEwan feel this was a story that needed to be told? Maybe I'm missing something profound, but to me, Amsterdam is nothing more than a well crafted story about a lot of pretentious, vapid, self absorbed losers. Worthy of the Booker? Definitely not."
2,Amsterdamned,"A pleasant short toss - off. Rather like a quick appetizer chowed down while waiting for friends. But you had better be up on your City ""in-jokes"" because this is a story best digested by those readers that know the menu in advance. For those that don't, it is a pleasant side dish, but hardly stuff that deserves a Booker. Would I leave a tip? No. Would I recommend it to friends? Sure, but you'll find better eating elsewhere. Try ""Master Georgie""."
4,My Grandmother,"For those of you who have read the book, the character of Margit, is my grandmother. Still alive, she is one of the strongest women I will ever know in my life. I had the honor of going to Auschwitz a few years ago and seeing the barracks of where my family was held. I have read this book many times and cry every single time knowing the suffering they had to endure. Petru wrote very well and I am proud to have this book in my possession."
4,Nice addition to my collection,"I needed a brown strap watch to wear to work. It looks nice, not too keen on the quality of the strap, but it looks good enough. I will probably replace the strap in the future. But all in all, its a nice watch to have."
3,it works,"I'm replacing my Mr Coffee tea maker and while I like that the tea strength can be adjusted and the shape of the pitcher is great, I liked my Mr Coffee better. It made more tea, 3 qt as opposed to 2 qt"
4,Makes Great Iced Tea,If you drink a lot of iced tea you may want the larger 3-quart maker but this is a great item.
5,Perfect brewed tea,"This is my 3rd iced tea maker. I bought one for myself and my adult children loved it so much, I bought each if them one. They love it. The design is great because the slim pitcher slides smartly in the fridge. Love it!"
4,Amazon/Hamilton Beach,Excellent product. I've had other electric tea makers but none were as convenient asthe Hamilton Beach. I would reccomend this one to all who ask.
5,Just Love It,"This Hamilton Beach 40911 2-Quart Electric Iced Tea Maker is a great little Ice Tea maker. The pitcher fits into a slide out tray thus eliminating the possibility of a leak.I use this tea maker about every 2 to 3 days, however I am a family of one. It is economical with the use of tea bags as I only use 4 bags each time I brew 2 quarts with the strong setting however I like a mild tea."
4,Sun Tea Replacement! Works for me!,"A friend warned me against bacteria possibilities with my familiar sun tea, so I bought this to replace sun tea and like the taste better than sun tea. I gave it minus a star only because it takes up so much counter space, but I love the way it works. Also it is all plastic, so I don't know about longevity. You can use the included pitcher, but I found a narrow one for the fridge and I like that better. I don't think the pitcher would take a drop very well. I am quite satisfied with it and the tea it makes. You need to add ice to the pitcher when making the brew and it takes a little over a quart of ice."
1,Don't believe the previous reviews - this is JUNK!!,"I bought this unit, to replace a Mr. Coffee TM3 iced tea maker, which kept cracking the pitcher (mass defect - read about it).What a joke. This unit drizzles water into the pitcher. Sounds good, but if you use a tea bag, it floats on top! It does not allow the tea to steep, which is essential for good ice tea.You can use free tea leaves, but then the tea taste like grit.Do yourself a favor. Get the Mr. Coffee unit, order 3 replacement pitchers.And most of all - don't order products because of Amazon reviews!"
5,Excelent,"Really love this, use it at least every week. It's great and they are really good recipes, not to mention super useful instructions in the beginning about some basic butchery stuff everyone should know!"
3,Fluffy fluffy fluffy,"Making Minty Malone is very light reading, competantly written overall. If it's a break from more serious stuff you desire, then this will fit the bill. The plot moves along nicely, the main characters are engaging and some of the minor characters are a hoot. Everybody gets what they deserve in the end, good or bad. Basically, I won't be buying the hardback edition for my library but I'm not sorry I took the time to read it either."
2,Disappointed,"After recently reading a slew of British thirty-something British novels, I was disappointed once I reached page 10 of this book. The story itself is good, & there are some great & really funny moments... but it's all mixed up with wordiness & blah-blah-blah. It's written by the author like a B film (e.g. incidents are referred to repeatedly for the reader; the character repeats herself outloud (to herself!). It was annoying in the way that you'd hear a certain friend's problems over & over again, & you finally (although in a fantasy) want to just slap her out of it. I didn't dislike the book enough not to finish it, but it was a loooooong read that could've been cut in half - literally - if it didn't have all that extra soap-opera, low-IQ repetition."
5,So handy,"I like to buy art and hang it up...yep, I'm that kind of person. It's more fun when it's not sitting on the floor gathering dust from passing footsteps. So, I bought this ""value kit"" and hung up 5 pictures in one day! Easily! I couldn't find my hammer though so ended up using a rock to pound the little brad nails in...I'm serious. And it still worked easily to install these, and my pictures are still hanging up several days later!"
1,poor quality,"I tried and tried to get the nail to pass through the hole with no luck. I tried numerous different hooks, with different nails. Never got a one through the hole. The packaging says it won't damage your walls, it will RUIN them. Since I had put the hook to the wall and then tried to hammer in the nail through the hole, and since the nail would not go through, it punched the hook/hanger into the wall, leaving an impression. I tried many different sizes and nails to no avail. What a waste of money. Very disappointing."
5,Roget's Thesaurus Of The Bible,"I bought a copy of this years ago, once I saw the price of 37 cents. This is an amazing book will find a particular subject, a category list to relevant Bible passages. This book compiles the most popular English translations. This is a must for any serious Christians' Library."
2,not what I thought it would be,this was fine as a water saving shower head but put out a fine mist tather than the powerful jet spray I remembered from a previous Alsons' head of the same shape. I bought the USB3C from Whedon Products instead and that was great!
2,Waste of money,"This shower head is total garbage, my broken one works better.It only sprays water 2 feet, and not enough to wash the soap off, its more like a mister, and sprays the wall and curtain more than yourself. It literally decreased my water pressure by 300%.The worst purchase I ever made.On the plus side, I got it next day."
2,"It is a low flow, but","This shower head sprays soft,and wide(the water hits the curtain, and the wall) There is a hole in the middle.I wanted a concentrated flow in the middle. If this is what you want too, you don't want it either."
1,Some secrets are better kept,"There is no excuse for this beyond trying to capitalize on the then-waning success of a formerly (briefly) novel sounding voice. While he found success with his forceful, bluesy vocal production in the pop/R&B genre during the earlier part of the last decade, he should have never taken this step. The raspy, strained sounds issuing forth from Mr. Bolton's throat were, by the time of original recording, already beginning to grate on American housewives' nerves. Calling upon such paltry resources borders on the blasphemous in this material. An aria by aria critique would be pointless and would be plain mean. Suffice to say: 'Nessun Dorma'? Maybe not, but a good long nap is definitely the desired alternative to staying awake through this embarrassing display."
1,You get what you pay for!,"After just a few uses, the bottom inside of the pot started peeling and left black junk all over the pasta....yuck! I paid under $20 for it so I guess it's true....you get what you pay for. I liked the idea of a pot and colander in one, so I'm going to invest in a quality pot."
5,Blistex berry lip balm.,"The best lip balm out there. Have to buy it by the case. Have one in every pocket, drawer, car and room."
5,best lip balm,I love Blistex Berry and keep one in my purse at all times. It goes on smooth and lasts longer than others I've tried. The berry flavor is very light without a medicinal taste.
5,Very nice!,Really nice box with hinged lid. Kind of expensive but worth the quality! I'm using it for my assortment of essential oils. Shipping was free and fast!!!!
2,High resolution = blurry text. Convergence & Geometry issues,"This so-so monitor is over-rated by consumer.The price is CHEAP compared to the other 22"" (even with other NEC 22""s)Problem is very obvious, geometry and convergence at any resolution.Move to higher res. and text will become blurry.Very good for playing games (low resolution like 800x600 or 1024x768). Not recommended if you want to use higher than 1280x1024 res for regular use (Internet, word, etc.)In other words, this would make a good monitor for my parents."
2,eeeeeehhhh....,"Not as good as I expected. The warioware games are much better. Maybe it was too kiddish for me. To simple, not much depth here. Get warioware touched or twisted instead."
2,"this book is not for novice ""creatives""","The title states it's ""Basic techniques for creatives"", please take a look at page 1 (using Amazon's 'search inside' feature). On the very first page the author starts displaying lines of code- is this supposed to mean anything to the novice? This kind of sets the pace for the rest of the book. I've been using Flash for 8 years as an animation tool, so I would consider myself a 'creative'. I need a book that walks me through the very basics or what Actionscript is and how it works. Simple stuff, like how to make a functional button and why it works. The first three pages the author touches on some of the actionscript interface descriptions and them launches straight into code, complicated programming the author assumes you already know. Really, I can't say if this book is good or bad, because I have no idea what he is talking about. All I can say is, this book is for programmers, not for artists (or 'creatives') or any one trying to learn action script basics."
5,Absolutley Beautiful film,"Kate Hepburn and Rosanno Brazzi are gorgoues to watch. Venice is amazing to see as it was filmed in the 50's though it probably looks the same today if you should be so lucky to go. The scenery in Venice is unbelievably beautiful and pulls you right in,..you feel like you are there. This film makes you happy and want to book a trip there immediately, though I feel like Ive already been after watching this. You can watch this over and over throughout the years. It is a timeless classic, well worth ordering. Im so glad I finally did. Credit must go also to the super talented, fabulous David Lean, who is a totally phenomenally talented director/producer who also did Dr. Zhivago (need I say more). Although I do think that at least one small scene is missing b/c I remember watching this yrs ago and remembering a scene where Kate offers a btl of Compari to share with her new vacation friends and it is not in this version. oh well. You won't regret ordering this! arivederci."
5,The Ultimate Venice Tour,Even though the movie is nearly sixty years old very little in Venice has changed. Anyone planning a trip to Venice will benefit from seeing this movie since it perfectly captures the atmosphere they can experience for themselves. You can still visit the location where Hepburn falls in to the canal and the shop that was temporarilly turned into Rossano Brazzi's antique shop. The storyline does not overwhelm the visual experience of the city.
5,Magnificent,Summertime is one of my favorite films. Katharine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi are superbly cast in this great film. Venice isa dream. Sad ending though. I would have stayed in Venice.
5,"Venice, Katharine, Rossano, Romance; enough said!","I have watched this magical bittersweet movie at least 25 times. And it only gets better every time. Katharine Hepburn is just superb as the spinster who finally makes a much anticipated trip to Venice, Italy. 'Everything' about this delightful film creates the ultimate escape for the true romantic viewer. The scenery of Venice, filmed in 1955, is breathtaking. Katharine is at her very best and Rossano is perfect as the married Italian man she reluctantly but helplessly falls in love with. The symbolism expressed throughout the film is sweet, sad and haunting. The little boy she befriends is adorable, and the almost ever present theme song quickly becomes, ""One of your favorites""... I cannot recommend this charming, captivating and heart-warming film enough!"
2,Not user friendly,Perhaps something went wrong in the translation because the book is hard to use. Example: To find subscript in the index you have to know if you want an array subscript or a literal subscript. The user guide is better if you can find one so don't waste your money.
3,uuuuugggggh ! u need m tires !,"Most cave family books get into evolution. Thanks for NOT including that belief, Mrs. Dubowski. I think the stone henge style swing is cute. Too bad that really wasn't their purpose. This is a good BOY BOOK. No DOGS OR HORSES !Invention of the wheel couldn't have been more fun !"
2,Well...,"First off I do not own this album nor do I intend to. The reason I'm reviewing it at all is I saw them warm up for Savatage last night and they kept mentioning this album while they attempted to perform. what I heard was in a word lousy. They had no energy to speak of. The music was repatitive and uniteresting. How this band got a record contract is beyond me. The keyboarist/guitarist should spend either all his time playing the guitar (since he is quite good) or learn to play the boards 'cos he needs help. Good drumming, I wished the horrid singer would shut up so I could just hear the drumming. The bass isn't bad needs a few lessons or something though to impress, the other guitarist did a good job though. As I said their lead voclaist should just keep his mouth shut and was horrid. i gave the band 2 stars 'cos of the one guitarist and drummer this album is a waste of money though."
5,"Progressive ""Light""....","I agree with a previous member who said that FW takes a good riff and builds a great PROG feeling song around it---without jerking you around too much. Don't get me wrong, I like the ""jerky"" stuff too. FW is subtle prog----more like Queensryche----not like Dream Theater. It's Prog ""light"". Good musicianship, good lyrics/vocals, good hard edge guitar. By the way, I saw FW in concert twice last summer (opening for QR and DT). Awesome!!!!!!!"
5,The best of both stars,"Although not a comedy, this is the best Cary Grant movie ever. It draws you in the same way An Affair to Remember does and doesn't let go throguh out the entire movie.Kay Francis does an amazing job playing the cold mean wife and Carole Lombard is at her best!PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PUT THIS ON DVD"
5,Very good!,"I like old black and white movies and I adore the Hollywood stars of the golden era, such as Cary Grant and Carole Lombard. I wish this movie was available in DVD. Maybe soon it will be...This movie is a romance drama, and I think that both Cary and Carole did a good job. The storyline was well done and believable. Kay Francis co-starred as the conniving, gold-digging wife of Cary who tries to thwart the love of Cary and Carole. In the end though, Kay's character gets her just do.The imagery and cinematography was crisp and the lighting was very good.This is not a movie that one sees on a usual basis (on tv or in the video stores), so this would be a nice addition to your classic movie collection at home."
5,terrific movie,i too saw this movie on tv and am currently looking for it on video. Any ideas since this site does not have it? lw050899@aol.com
1,Not worth it,"There were many discrepancies within the stories. It was hard for me to keep up. Usually I like this type of thing but this one couldn't hold my interest past the first chapter. My advice? If the public library has it, borrow it from them. Don't buy it"
2,Super Stock,"I am unable to review as of this date, January 17, 2009 - I have as yet not received this item - last correspondence from your site was that I would be getting an update on January 15th,2009 - PLEASE ADVISE STATUS. Thank you."
4,Only okay,"In principle, I like this emblem, although I believe it is flawed from a scientific viewpoint because, just like the Flintstones, Jesus fish never actually coexisted with dinosaurs.Now that I mention it, I'm not sure Jesus fish coexisted with anything since I think existence is a prerequisite for coexistence, but whatever. This still looks awesome on the back of my Outback.When it eventually falls off, I think I'd like to replace it with something of the ""Calvin Peeing"" genre. Potentially on a Jesus fish, if they make that. Or maybe a Spaghetti Monster getting freaky on his fishy ass like something out of a Japanese comic book.Man, those are messed up."
4,Good book,"I liked the book. It's great in a class setting as if you have follow up questions, obviously a teacher is the best source of help/info."
1,Not for Non-Mechanics,"I hoped this book would help me perform basic maintenance, make very minor repairs and have some idea of what the problem is when I have to take the car to the mechanic. Unfortunately, the book is very hard to understand and information is hard to find in it. Maybe a professional mechanic could understand it, but then a professional mechanic would be probably have official information from GM. The information may be accurate (I have no way of knowing), but this book makes little attempt to help out the beginner."
2,wheelock is NOT for those new to latin/learning a language!!,"What a headache of a book! Please note that unless you have studied many years of a foreign language, are already familiar with Latin, or are a grammar genius, this book is probably not for you. The text really throws you right into complicated sentence structure and conjugations without practice and I've read advice from several sources that say Wheelock is generally made for graduate students with strong foreign language back grounds. I personally switched to the Cambridge approach which I'm enjoying much more, but if you have to use this book and have any doubts--get the sudy guide!! If you are not worried about any of the above, than you may at least find some of the text of the book interesting. It's a decent approach, just not for beginners."
4,Good beginning...,"This book offers the beginning Latinist a nice walk-through of grammar and vocabulary. It is especially appropriate for students who are tackling Latin on their own as it includes some exercises that have keys in the back. It also includes some basic vocabulary to help students in their readings of the text.However, this book would not be the best choice for someone who is trying to learn as much Latin as possible in a short period of time.For someone serious about the study of Latin (and who is able to take some time with the language) this book will provide a solid foundation!"
4,Don't believe the hype,"This book is pretty good, and I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 3 only because I want to err on the side of caution. It deserves points for its winning enthusiasm and smarmy humorousness; it garners negatives for the awful ""snippety"" nature of its exercises in which no context is given and sentences are expected to be understood. I am not sure about the reviewers who discuss how Wheelock alone made them understand grammar: it seems that other books are good at that as well. I think that overall I recommend it (having learned Latin from it) but not as wholeheartedly as some of the other reviewers."
3,"Textbook Latin--not ""real"" Latin","Wheelock provides one with the basics of Latin in an easy-to-understand format, but, unfortunately, moving on to unedited Latin texts will be difficult for the Wheelock-trained. A better book is Moreland & Fleischer's Latin: An Intensive Course (U of California Press). It covers more of the ""obscure"" constructions that are common in real Latin."
1,boring,"I was hoping this would have better ideas in it. They are pretty boring, my kids would not want to do any of these for their Christmas pageant. Some of the skits are not very Biblical."
1,New Album Cover-Same Old Songs,"Very surprised at Rhino Records, a label known for innovative ""best of"" collections. This is just another reissue of old songs from Judy Collins that have been on countless compilations already. Think I'll print out the cover art, and tape it to any of my other Judy Collins cds. Very disappointed."
4,A GREAT COMPILATION OF JUDY COLLIN'S MUSIC,A great blend of some of Judy's greatest songs....highly recommend!
2,Did not produce,"The ordering and shipping went well. Saved money but did not get the same capacity - the first drum only printed 1,000 sheets - a far cry from the 5,000 it is supposed to. Second drum printing better, but not sure it will reach target goal. Will not buy remanufactured again."
1,Defective product,"This product was exactly as advertised and in an unopened box, but it was defective. My copies came out totally black. I thought perhaps it was my printer, but when I installed a new print cartridge, everything worked perfectly. I'm out the $$$ spent on this."
3,This scope was pretty good. It had a ...,"This scope was pretty good. It had a very nice flavor and freshened my mouth and breath. I liked that the flavor was not too overpowering like some other brands on the market. And it didn't taste strong or """"mediciney."""" I used this product probably several times a day, usually after brushing my teeth, but sometimes just during the day (not after brushing teeth). I liked the immediate feel of my breath. The only complaint I have is that it didn't last too long. Overall, however, it's pretty good and I guess I'd recommend it."
2,Missing a Lot!,"This is not the original edition used for general theatrical release. It has been ""cleansed"" by somebody for God-knows-what-reason.When seen in the original version, including all of Grant's speeches (the Peace of Holland, a Peace of France, etc), the result is pretty funny, despite some slow moments.This is an important piece of pre-WWII anti-fascist movie making from the 1940's. Ginger Grant is her usual lovely self, while Grant tries desperately but nearly fails in the underplayed hero category.Overall, this would be better if some dunderheaded editor would not have cut the film so darn much!"
5,More than cool,"Not only does this book feature absolutely breathtaking lithographs of original artwork from Lain, most of what is written in Japanese within its pages is translated, right there, in English.I've never seen any anime artbook do that before. The title may say ""Japanese Language Text"", but the truth is, the book is bilingual."
2,Paperback-Southern style,"The seller did a fine job and would purchase other books from them again.I bought this particular book because the author is a sister to Jill Conner Browne of the Sweet Potato Queen series. It was slightly amusing, in my view, but not as funny as her sister. You would need to be your own judge on this one."
1,"Might be fiction, but get the basics right.","Does this author do any preparation? ""...a fast-closing blur that resolved itself into an aircraft: a helicopter. An A-130 Spectre gunship."" (pg 11) Now come on. I know this is fiction, but if you are going to use real equipment, know what it is. It's not a helicopter - it's an airplane. Now, if that glaring fact hadn't been muddled, we could probably look past the fact that it is an ""AC-130 Spectre"" and not an ""A-130"". The aircraft plays an itegral role in the scene for several paragraphs, therefore it would have been worth typing it into any search engine before writing about it! Authors should do their homework, or at least wait until after the first chapter to take shortcuts."
2,up the hill and down the slope,"it's not that this record is so bad, it just can't live with the bands past records which are gleaming. this is their worst record so far. -justify the rain- and -because you- get the album off to a good start but it's all down the slidy slope after that until -life in wartime- shows a bit of a tempo change. afterwards the last song, -smile- is fine. after -melodic sunshine- and -deliverance-, you might expect a lot more effort to continue the great work of the past. suppose all bands run out of gas sometime."
3,My 'Fair' Maiden,"This is by far the poorest of the first 5 studio albums, yet it was their most popular.The only song that reallly stands out is 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'. Yeah ""Number of the Beast"" is good, and contains one of the greatest screams of all time, but when compared to the rest of the 'Early Maiden' albums even that falls short. Run to the Hills had a funny video (remember the REAL Headbanger's Ball on MTV?), but over all this album is weak.One possible reason for this, is that this was the first album with Bruce Dickinson on vocals. It could be that the band was still trying to find their new identity..If you don't own any Maiden, don't make this your first purchase. You can do better. I would recommend Powerslave, Killers, Iron MAiden, Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time and Seventh son of a Seventh Son before I would recommend this one."
5,"Amazing Album, But Horrific Remaster!","This album rocks and no metal fan should be without it!but...This remaster sounds awful; it is loud, flat, and generally unexciting.Do yourself a favor and buy the original CD release, as it is miles ahead of this one."
1,Remastered? seriously?,"How to get a classic metal album from the 80s to sound like it was produced in the 2000s? Simple: don't actually enhance any of the sounds by adjusting each channel individually, but just compress the range and suck the air right out of the songs. What do you get in return? Unnaturally high treble and overemphasized (bloated and muddier) bass, making for a pleasantly vacant Bose ""industry standard"" V-shaped eq curve. Steve harris's bass is more akin to rumblings than any actual instrument and the high hats of niko's drums sounds like some mother shooshing her kids.Please do yourself a favor and get this album from a local record store or get it used. the one that amazon is selling is the aforementioned remastered version that i wish i returned to them."
4,"The beginning of the ""Golden Age""","With this album (their third), Iron Maiden entered their ""Golden Age"" as we loyal fans call it. It features the phenomenal singer Bruce Dickinson for the first time. The depths of the lyrics improves by leaps and bounds when compared to their first two albums.However, in my opinion, the album is pretty pale compared to their next two albums. However, I still love songs like ""22 Acacia Avenue"" and the MONUMENTAL ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"". What a song this is!! This is the first of the epic songs that Iron Maiden went on to produce after this (""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner"", ""The Loneliness Of A Long Distance Runner"" and so on).This one song is worth the price of the entire album. It is just amazing how they came up with those lyrics.In conclusion, this is one of those Metal masterpieces which every headbanger should have in his music collection."
5,Still sleepwalking?,I just finshed this wonderful book and highly recommend it. Reagan's current reputation is inflated and this book will tell you why. A placebo is all Mr.Reagan was and many americans are still sleepwalking today.
4,Not a Reagan fan,"The book is highly documented and would be devasting to the Reagan worshipers if they read it with open minds. I am still not clear as to what degree the author is saying that Reagan was out of touch, incompetent, ""out of the loop"", and whether his handlers wanted to have it both ways: Reagan the wise sage when convenient, and asleep at the wheel when things went badly."
1,A MISREADING OF HISTORY,"Haynes Johnson's analysis in this tome is so far off base, it is difficult to know where to begin explaining the folly of his ways. It makes a fascinating read, however, after living through most of the 1990s. It proves that we are truly living in the decade of absurdity, with our only hope for redemption the economic growth spurred by the supply side economics and deregulation of the 1980s. If you want to understand the difficulties in interpreting the history of a decade two years after its close, please pick up this book."
1,Sleepwalking through reality by a somnabulist,"This book is a classic example of why PBS should have its taxpayer life support plug pulled when they employ a leftist to give us his ""unbiased"" view of the world on ""News Hour.""His fellow leftist and plagiarist, Goodwin, I guess is the ""balance"" for his views.This book is so much nonsense that I don't know where to start in pointing out its complete abandonment from any semblance of journalistic honesty.But if you are a Kool-Aid leftist, you will love this book. If you have more than a fifth-grade education, you will wonder why you wasted your two dollars to buy it."
5,"Terrific group, terrific album!","This was the first album I purchased several years back, and I've been a fan since. Originally hearing ""Caroline"", the lyrics literally and figuratively spoke to me. I rushed out to find the CD andxwhile each song differs, the album as a whole is fantastic!"
4,I like the mirror image technique.,"I like the mirror image technique method for teaching this form. However, sometimes the movement of the camera to the sides still confuses me during the learning.I like the features of learning step by step with three repetitions which may be linked or may be taught with each step.This may be an excellent supplement for practice between lessons with an instructor."
2,Great Content - Poor Delivery,"This is a great book. Well written with lots of good information for the motorcyclist.The issue I have is the publishers binding of the book. I opened this book and within minutes a page fell out. Within 24 hours, 40+ pages had come loose from the book.Amazon has an execellent on line system for replacing defective merchandise. I used it, and the book was replaced within a few days.Unfortunatlly the replacement book had exactally the same problem. Very poor binding.I just put it on the shelf, a victum of crappy publishing.I can not reccomened it for this reason alone and that is too bad."
2,Same information as first book with little expansion.,"I found this book having the same information as his other one (Proficient Motorcycling). A lot of the text was verbose, and he could have stuck in a lot more information while cutting out on repetition. If you have read his Proficient Motorcycling book, I would not recommend buying this. Instead, expand your knowledge through a maintenance manual or a book on performance riding. Twisted throttle 2 has really good videos, although I have not read the book yet.."
5,"Paul Tillich, Call Your Office","Hillary's high school youth group inspiration, liberal theologian Paul Tillich, once wrote that ""Christianity is the religion of which Socialism is the practice."" Opitz completely disagrees, and demonstrates through convincing logical arguments that actually, socialism is an internal version of the international ""imperialism"" that these same liberals also scorn: a politically connected minority milking the majority of their wealth, and coining pious arguments to justify it. Nothing particularly Christian about any of it. This is a great book. If I were a socialist, I'd compel you to read it."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I've enjoyed this series. It keeps one's interest, and its a fast read. I was slightly disappointed with the love triangle resolution. Why the dilemma if the loser isn't even given much of a cursory glance? Also, with all of the action & conflict within the last few pages, the resolution was anti-climactic. I expected better, but any questions were answered in this last book."
1,Authoritarian and disturbing,"I read a short segment of this book at the library, and knowing his history, I found what I read disturbing. I am not a Xian, but the authoritarian viewpoint is scary and unsettling for one who allegedly espouses Xian philosophy."
5,Good window to help others see Christ,I loaned a copy to the attorney in the next office and he said it would be long time before I got it back. He is not a believer at this point. It will make for some good discussions for us.Colson uses appropriate illustrations and clear thinking to explore the avenues to happiness that people take. Read The Good Life and share it around.
2,Not the color I was expecting...,"The item looks as described except in the colour. I was expecting a white basket but I received a ""water"" colour basket. I think the description is misleading on this aspect since it doesn't state clearly what is the colour of the item... that is why I am giving 2 stars... not for the item itself but because of the description."
2,Broken,"This arrived broken in one corner and it looks like it was packaged that way, not done in transit.Otherwise cute and too much of a pain to return."
4,"Much better than ""execution of innocence""","What Pike can write when he puts his mind to it. I enjoyed this book very much. It was about time Pike wrote a book with Greek Mythology in it. Congratulations! You have won the Rita Approval Award. The only ending I like of the books Pike wrote. I like the way the past blends with the present, but the dreams were lame -- too used by various other authors. On the whole, though, it was better than some."
5,Finally!!!,"After years of having my copies of this album somehow keep disappearing, getting another copy, losing that copy & years of being without any copies as it is now out of print, I was thrilled to find a copy for a decent price in (I hope; haven't been able to play it yet)good condition. Young's version of ""Rye Whiskey"" has got to be the all time definitive version & I am so glad to have it at my disposal once more. Now, if I can just replace the needle in my phonograph, I'll be set!"
1,insulting to better then average pool player,Bought it because of Johnny Cash. Would not give it as a gift to my worst enemy....
1,Terrible!!,"This album is a major drop in quality as compared to The Leave's first, 1966 debut album. The debut fused folk-rock, garage-punk, and psychedelia bringing to mind a minor version of the Byrds. Their debut is certainly the equal of Love's first album. It contained the best version of Hey Joe and was a great garage/folk-rock record. All The Good That's Happening is sadly, just plain bad. Lemon Princess is a lame psychedelic tune that sounds childish today. There are a couple of competent folk-rock tunes in the Byrds mold but these songs are nothing special. This record, which I believe is now out of print (thank god), is only recommended to completists."
3,A mistake,I would just like to observe that their is a mistake in his research. ORB-Otto Robert Bade did not begin his business in PA; he moved there. The ORB collection began on LONG ISLAND! My grandmother lived next to the Bade's for many years and they were close friends. My uncle even worked at the shop and made silver bracelets for his sisters for Christmas.So you may wish to take the research in this book with a grain of salt.
2,I'm sure it will work for others.,"Saw this on Dr. Oz and couldn't wait to find it. But it did NOT work for me, at all. I am still kind of surprised, because I KNOW it has for others. I took it by directions, with lots of water, and lost NO weight, no water nothing. It would be best to find out what body type/weight loss plan is best for this supplement first. Then purchase if it sounds right for you."
4,Works pretty well,"If you're looking for a pill that is magical and burns off the pounds, this isn't it.If you looking for something that helps fill you up before a meal and likely lower your cholesterol, this is for you.Warning: The extreme amount of fiber in will cause looser bowel movements early on... Nothing that doesn't subside in a couple days."
2,DVD menu does not work,"Like the previous reviewer, we found upon purchase that the menu on one of the discs does not work. The problem for us is that the malfunctioning disc contains the title story, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, which was the reason that we bought the collection. Numerous calls to Scholastic produced no satisfaction; in fact, it seemed to me that not only was the company not interested in hearing that they had released a defective product, they did not seem the least bit interested in fixing the problem. After this experience, I cannot imagine every purchasing another product manufactured by this company again."
4,good story,"Good acting by Jaclyn Smith and she continues to look great, too. Sweet story with a happy ending."
1,Quite possibly the worst book on improv ever,"While I'm sure Delton T. Horn has spent a lot of time in bars performing in front of drunks, he really doesn't seem to have a true grasp of the theatrical convention of improvisation. This book was a total waste of time and money.If you really are interested in the art of improvisation, buy ""Truth in Comedy"", ""Impro for Storytellers"", or ""Improvise: Scene from the Inside Out""."
3,practice makes perfect,"I have read almost all of Glen Cooks books, and have enjoyed them for almost 20 years. The reprint of this book shows why authors get better the more they practice their trade. When I was 17, I would have loved this book. Today, not so much. Still, it was fun."
5,Possibly the best space opera EVER written,How Cook isn't better known than people like Silverberg who don't write nearly as well I will never know.
4,The First 9/11 Truth Book I Ever Read,"I read this book a couple of years ago and it made me start to question the whole official story on 9/11. If it does nothing else, the book will have served its purpose. It made me question and do research and was my real introduction to 9/11 Truth. It's a great introductory book on the subject."
5,Pop's Salvation,"I'm a hardcore pop fan and over the last few years I've been sadly disappointed with American pop. I was fortunate enough to discover that one of my old favorites, Roxette, was still together and releasing new music. In their single, ""Salvation"" Roxette shows that pop does not have to be cliched and manufactured to be good! The single song ""Salvation"" speaks of an older and deeper Roxette. They have left behind ""Joyride"" for a much deeper understanding of the true nature of love! The single also contains two previously unreleased tracks, ""See Me"" and ""Crazy About You."" They are the jewels of the album. After listening to ""Crazy About You"" I found a new favorite to add to my long list of Roxette favorites! ""Salvation"" needs to be on the shelf of every pop fan who longs for lyrics and music that speak to the soul. Roxette is well worth the money that goes into this import. They haven't lost their touch! The music is still golden!"
1,Strangely Misleading and Poorly Done. Look elsewhere.,"Okay, I'm really confused. The actual CD package, in my hand, does not even remotely match up with the track listings shown here. More importantly, the songs that are really on the two CD's (20 tracks each, and all live, presumably from Nat's TV show) sound as if they were recorded by placing a really cheap microphone in front of a really cheap TV's speaker. And, the editing is terrible. The songs fade in and out almost randomly.Something is not right here. Definitely bypass this zero-star offering.""The Nat King Cole Story"", and ""Nat King Cole The Greatest Hits"" are good places to start, to listen to the actual songs from this truly great artist, and great human being."
3,A Cookie House (aka Hansel & Gretel),"A kindergarten or lst grade reader version of Hansel & Gretel. And absolutely fine as a primer.However, I bought it for Kinuko Craft's illos. A mistake. An early work and nowhere near the level of her current excellent artwork. I own just about every work she's illustrated and wouldn't have believed this was hers but for the byline. Still it is better than many illustrations by others."
5,great product,I bought this lipbalm from Amazon because it was cheap and i couldnt find it anywhere else. My gf was happy when I got this for her.
3,Overrated...,"I dont know if it'sbecause i'm just breaking in the stick but thi feels just like regulr chapstick, and even less moisturizing sometimes...Blistex Lip Medex feels better to me so far...I expected that ""cooling relief"" feeling from Natural Ice that you get from using Blistex Lip Medex...U know, that tingling feeling on your lips to let u know it's ""the good stuff""...Havent felt it yet...but it is still summer so..*shrug*"
3,It's OK.,It has a nice minty taste and feeling to it. Although it's better than others but it still feels a bit waxy compared to others like Kiel...
5,Great stuff!,"I was trying to wean myself away from some very high-priced but lovely lip balm (Fresh Sugar Lip), so I thought I would try these based on their reviews. I use this every day, several times a day, and I really love it. When it was warmer, I also cycled for about an hour every day, and I would come back with the worst chapped lips if I didn't use my other lip balm. When I changed to this much less expensive lip balm, it was perfect - I didn't even need to reapply upon my return home. This is great stuff and so affordable. Plus, it seems to last a long time. Recommended!"
3,I prefer cat oil instead,I read all these reviews before purchasing and thought i found the holy grail of chap-stick. NOPE it is the same as everything else...may be less wax may be more who really knows. The people giving this 5 stars must not get out to the stores often and purchase regular chap-stick.
3,It's OK,The lip stick is okay. It is no difference than any other brand of lip stick.I do not recommend it to my friend.
4,It Covers The Basics & a Little More,I have bought a number of disks from this company. They usually do what they say. The chapters are listed and that is what is on disk. Be warned this is not like a typical DVD. I think It would be better described as a DVD ROM. A menu of chapters run down left side and you can ONLY RUN ON COMPUTER. Product will teach you the basics. If you know very little about ebay then this may be for you. If you have used ebay successsfully before you may already know enough not to justify buying this. It will teach you how to buy and sell on ebay in a very non complicated way.
3,"SO, SO but one of the books you should have.","The book is great starting out and I will apologize now I have not completed the book but am half way finished with 12 lessons done. Like I was saying, the book starts off great, slow, eases into the language. It doesn't assume that you have done the language before and brings you right to the beggining point where you should be. And then whoa, the grammar hits you like a ton of bricks. Grammar after grammar lessons will be taught so be prepared. My personal opinion is that the grammar essons could give up a little to vocabulary and vocab usage could be used a little more. Another thing that has me livid is that the quizes at the end don't have answers. I don't know why but that is not the greatest idea. As well a unit review would be nice to re drill what you've learned into context.Thanks Christian"
5,The Basics and The Fine Points,"The book is extremely clear and not only goes over all the verb tenses and other grammar, but hits most of the fine points of usage too, such as why ya and todavia can easily be confused, or the difference between el viejo amigo and el amigo viejo. I would combine with Pimsleur which gets you speaking and internalizing the sentence structure. But you need this to then learn grammar and additional vocabulary, helpfully arranged in categories like ""Dining Out,"" ""At the University,"" ""The Medical Field,"" etc. Spring for the new addition, because the older one has no answer keys for the quizzes."
1,Did they use an editor?,"This book looked like a wonderful book, and I loved the pace and the ease of covering each of the subjects, but...On almost every page I found spelling, grammar and typographical errors. It got to the point that I was using a pencil to correct them myself and needed to keep the sharpener handy.Also, there is no answer key to any of the exercises, so there is no way to check yourself at the end of the chapter tests."
2,so overwhelmed with boybands!!!!!!,"n2u is no different from all the other boybands.... to be completly honest they sound like a mix of b2k, 3rd storee, prymary colorz, and backstreet boys (all these groups are terrible singers).....this is a good song... im not hating there but after b2k im just tired of screamin girls cooing over a guy that takes his shirt off.... and tired of them on every dang magazine cover...please chill with boy bands!!!!!"
3,"Factual, but dry","One of the interesting things about this book is that it uses standard Mandarin Pinyin (Chiang Kai-Shek is Jiang Jieshi, Sun Yat-Sen is Sun Zhongshan, etc). While this can be very helpful to those who know Mandarin Pinyin, it can be somewhat confusing to those who do not.For the most part, the book is factual and unbiased, although Ebrey does allow her anti-Maoist bias to slant her discussion of post-1949 China. The read is extremely dry, however, and often comes across as a colorless collection of irrelevant facts."
4,Great set if you have to have the TV on!,"I am typically against tv, but since my 2 year boy is in daycare, he knows about tv. These are great, especially if you have the books. It is simply a narration of the books. We bought 3 scholastic sets as a Gold Box deal and my son enjoys them all, in moderation."
3,not very pleased with results,"I bought this product hoping that it would equal ""Best Prostate"" pills which are more expensive if not purchased in larger than single month quantity. Unlike Best Prostate which worked almost instantly to increase flow strength and reduce desire to urinate, this brand has had little or no effects. Will use them to finish the rest of the bottle but will go back to BP in 6 month quantities unless I see some real results."
5,So sensual,"I love this CD, have given many copies away as gifts and had to replace my own from use. It is the perfect accompaniment to long, slow sessions of sensual lovemaking, massage, energy work...it is beautful, quietly passionate, deep and satisfying. I highly recommend it, or any of Shastro's CD's, of which I have many."
1,Motor burnt in second day,I liked the stylish looks of this grinder and bought it without reading any reviews. The motor stopped working second day!! I'll send it back for refund. Will consider another grinder this time.
2,"Poorly edited, poorly organized","The first chapter--despite its title, ""Why you need life insurance""--attempts to define all sorts of life insurance jargon without explaining why someone would need this stuff. After stumbling over the fifth or sixth typo, I gave up on this book. I hope better ones are out there."
1,Do not buy this!,"I received this as a gift and was dismayed to find that the tracks are all performed by unknown and uncredited artists. Some of the tracks are instrumental, although this is not noted on the song list and is jarring in several cases as the orchestration sounds as though there should be vocals. I am sure the gift-giver assumed, as I did, that the songs were from the movie soundtracks - they are most definitely not. The quality of the ""digitally remastered"" tracks is low. You are much better off buying the movie soundtracks."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this mirror because it had a cute bear face for my baby to look at without being too colorful and tacky like some other auto mirrors out there. It's pleasant neutral color and seemed the perfect size for our Matrix. But unfortunately, the attachment (straps around the headrest with velcro) is so poor that the mirror barely ever stays in place, wiggles and loses the proper angle after going over any small bumps. Our daughter is 10 months now so it doesn't make sense to shop for a new one at this point since she will be facing the other way pretty soon but I can't believe that we put up with that thing for such a long time! I'm definitely buying a different one for my second child!"
4,A Case of Mistaken Identity,"When Flash/Flash was released, ""Small Beginnings"" and ""Children of the Universe"" received major airplay from prog-rock stations. At the time, the style was to play long segues, with almost no announcments. Most people never heard the artists credits... and with two alumni from ""Yes"", Peter Banks (guitar) and Tony Kaye (keyboards)... people ran out and bought ""The Yes Album"" and missed the band ""Flash"" completely. What a shame. This album really shows their talents, but the market just wasn't there for them. The songs on this album are great."
2,It has great pictures and ideas but.,This book gives you great ideas. But quilters are a busy bunch of people. It would have been a much better book if the author would have included some patterns. Majority of the ladies in my quilting club look for a pattern and have a terrible time making their own patterns. If I would have known it didn't contain patterns I wouldn't have purchased it. But I did so thru a book club. I design and make personable quilts and have been in the business for quite some time.
2,128 Pages of Eye Strain,"I purchased this book, sight unseen, because I am a collector of quilt block books. I love reviewing the books and planning my next project, this book, claiming to have '336' quilt blocks seemed to be ideal. Well, I was wrong. Dead Wrong.The layout of this book is TERRIBLE. It features six eye-poppingly colorful blocks per page which most of which are not pieced, but are merely DRAWN. There are illustrations which claim to be patterns but there are no actual measurements included. Sure, this looks good....But...The reader is left wondering how to put it all together.I think it is disingenuous NOT to show completed pieced blocks in a quilt block book or measurements. I probably will try to put a couple of the ""Tree"" blocks together, but I think it will be challenging.Recommended: No. A good 'idea' book, but not for careful piecers, and certainly NOT easy to complete in 10 minutes!"
4,Great product,"Pricing : value for moneyLooks :cute and trendyQuality :goodNo technical glitches, since its TIMEX."
5,I really enjoyed this album,"I hate to post a review like this but dont the negative scare you away from this album. Like others have said it's way more than the typical neoclassical shredding. Tony is all over the fretboard, he's playing inside the melody, outside and completly around the melody. throw in some syncopated jazz lines, layered harmonies, he put everything there is to offer in the album.It's worth a listen, and then a relisten, and then another listen to hear what you missed the first and second time."
5,Great sheet music,"I was very pleased with this piano music. The collection includes more songs than just ""God, and God Alone""."
5,Gilded Shines,"The author does an engaging job of letting the facts shine through in Gilded. In lively and unpretentious prose, she presents outrageous behavior with deliciously wry understatement. I hope other academics take note. I've read several popular histories recently that featured great material dulled down by excrutiating ""academese"" and intrusive commentary. (They seem to be close-captioning their work for the insight-impaired.) Dunlop lets her cleverness come through in her selection of characters and scandals that represent a time gone by -- yet seem all too familiar."
5,Genuine canker sore relief,"I developed horrible canker sores after being put on a particular anti-rejection drug. They were so bad I could neither eat nor sleep and drinking was tough, too! Sodium lauryl sulfate is used in almost all toothpaste cuz it makes the bubbles but it's also been shown to cause the sores. I can't use anything else if I want to be canker-free. DEFINITELY worth the price."
4,Great Product,This is an amazing tooth paste for all canker sore suffers. When you have a painful canker sore even something as routine as brushing your teeth hurts. This tooth paste is amazing it causes no scorching pain what so ever. It leaves your teeth clean and whitens are also others pluses. Great Buy!
2,It's A Hoax,"I have been using this product for about 4 weeks. I was encouraged during the first 3 weeks when I didn't get any canker sores. However by the third week I started to develop one, then another, then another. I currently have 3 canker sores in my mouth. One of them is enormous and has been spreading like wildfire for a week straight. It doesn't seem to prevent and it certainly doesn't help them heal faster."
4,Highly informative and enjoyable!,"I performed in this musical when I was 16, and I adored every aspect. Since then, the music has become some of my favorite, and I love anything to do with it. This movie not only gave me an idea of what it must have been like to do this show professionally, but it also revealed the personalities of some of my favorite Broadway stars! I thought it was a neat idea for a video!"
4,Pretty Good ... Especially for the Price,"Gas cap sticks a little and takes a couple tries to get it unlocked, but works pretty well for the price paid. No major complaints."
5,good for casual playing,"I thought these would be thicker and more sturdy, but in reality, they are fine for casual playing in the backyard or the beach... came with sticks and a stand."
5,LOVE this baby book!,I cannot say enough about this baby book! It's so easy to use/fill in and I love how I can just write the date and his information on the top of each page and not have to follow some pre-written book that outlines everything for you in a way that may not work for you. Very fun!
2,It grows on you,When guys from different bands who've had success in the past get together it usually is dissapointing. This CD was just that. It wasn't my cup of tea when I first heard it but the CD grows on you a little each time you hear it. It's the type of CD you pop in and listen to around the house but I find it boring and unimaginitive when I'm in my car. Not anything memorable or that you'd care to sing along to. It rocks some but I wouldn't call it hard. First two songs are probably the best ones and then there are a couple of decent ones in the middle. Not much of anything toward the end.
2,Cure for insomnia!,I am a huge fan of STP and I Always liked Filter. Put them together and you have a supergroup........WRONG! I gave this album 4 chances. There is not one song on it that goes anywhere. Very disappointing. A waste of my money and time!
2,audioslave syndrome,"i don't like this album , M.Patrick is a excellent singer and songwriter , but deleo brothers are out , songs are boring and the sound is too compressed , please rich patrick come back with filter..."
4,STP +,"Being a huge fan of STP I have eagerly awaited this debut release from Army of Anyone and I can say that it has been well worth the wait. AOA have almost taken STP to another level in regards to the energy level but at the same time retained the rich melodic riffs and vocal lines which were a hallmark of STP. Bob Ezrin's production is superb and the drumming of Ray Luzier is as dynamic as it gets - even reminiscent of Rush's Neil Peart particularly on the outro of track 2 ""Goodbye"". The opening track ""It Doesn't Seem to Matter"" is a killer."
5,Sweet game,"More and more lately there have been great AAA games available for the DS, and quite a few of them are more adult oriented than the usual kiddie fare. This game is sweet! Offering quite a bit of sophistication for the system and displaying some of the best graphics seen to date on the DS, the story will also hook you and pull you into the world of Altair, a much feared assassin. I've never felt so immersed on such a small screen. I feel like I AM Altair every time I play this. Excellent!"
5,The Last Story of the Heartwarming Tillermans!,"This is book 7 of the Tillerman saga, and I so wish there were more to follow. It stands alone as a wonderful book in itself; a wonderful character study of a strong willed, determined young woman who works intensely for her dreams. Dicey, the oldest of the Tillerman children, is perhaps an inspriration to all of us at any age. A wonderful, heartwarming good book!"
3,Ahh...okay.,"By now, the wonderfully three-dimensional characters such as Dicey and Jeff are beginning to wilt. I recommend this book to fans of Dicey because it is good to find out what happens, but this isn't a book worth reading more than two or three times. (the earlier ones in the series NEVER get old) It's too depressing, and the happy ending doesn't really make up for the depressing parts.I've always been disappointed that Jeff Greene, who is possibly my favorite character in all of literary fiction, is never fleshed out beyond A Solitary Blue. The later Dicey books make him out to be some sort of young god. Kind of disappointing."
5,Another Winner,"Cynthia Voigt created a bestselling series with the Tillerman family that began with ""Homecoming"" and ended with this book ""Seventeen against The Dealer."" Voigt's talented use of action and realistic dialogue to move the story along keeps readers turning the pages and longing for more. I became a Dicey fan early on for her courage and her spunk. Dicey, the whole Tillerman clan make excellent role models for today's young.I recommend this book to all the young and young at heart.Beverly J Scott Author of Righteous Revenge"
2,Worked for 2 days,"Recieved the keyless entry remote very promptly. I then went to the Jeep dealership and had it programmed for $49.99. It worked great for 2 days. Now it will not unlock/lock my doors unless I am within an arms reach of the car door. Kind of defeats the purpose. Maybe the battery is going dead, but I would have liked the battery to last me more than 2 days."
3,Gay photographer,"While a substantial amount of the collections represented in this book are stunning, there are still quite a few photographers' subjects which are a little ""under"" ordinary, but perhaps that was their point. Since this is a collection of photographers, an obvious few are missing like Tom Bianchi, Robert Mapplethorpe (although the editor's review says he is represented), Jim French and Bruce Weber. Obtaining rights to these prolific and world-renowned photographers' work may have been difficult, however."
1,Outdated,"This book was released in 2005, meaning that it was probably written in '04. Due to the rapidly changing nature of the current music industry, this book was already out of date when I read it in the spring of '08. Now that it is over 5 years old, there is no reason anyone should purchase and read this book. Additionally, I wouldn't recommend anything else by this author as the majority of his conclusions in this book couldn't have been any farther off base."
3,Jeopardy 2nd edition review,The game is ok. I don't like having to type in you're answers. I like the multiple choice option on the web based games better. Other than that it's ok.
4,Great Tool Kit,As good as tool kits can get. It is compact and the carrying case makes it easy to take with you.
1,Never received the item,There was issue with me receiving this item. Not really the fault of the seller. The mailman was at fault
