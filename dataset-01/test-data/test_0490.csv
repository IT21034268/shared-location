1,"Is this a mis-print, acme 3/8-12 insted of 3/8-16",I've been looking to purchase 'acme 3/8-16 RH' nuts in small quantities. Acme 3/8-16 RH (also LH) are in common use in lathes and milling machines. I have not come across an acme 3/8-12 nut or drive crew. Is this a misprint? Should it be acme 3/8-16? Is so let me know. -profharris
2,flat and cropped presentation of widescreen 3-D movie,"This was released to theatres in 1982 in full color polarized 3-D and widescreen (using the clear grey glasses) and on a low budget level was kind of fun. It is interesting today as it was Demi Moore's first film. I bet she leaves it off her resume these days. This DVD is presented flat and the widescreen image is cropped to fit the TV screen. I think they should have released it letterboxed at least. The 3-D is the main reason to watch the film anyway, so this DVD isn't really worth owning in my opinion. Better to search out the 3-D widescreen tapes that are out there (unofficially?)"
3,Goobers Of The Wasteland...,"Dr. Paul Dean (Robert Glaudini) has developed an organism that burrows into a human host and drains it of all life. The creature can also latch on to its victims, sucking them dry! Dean realizes that his company wants to use these PARASITE(s) for eeevil purposes, so he sets out to destroy the little monsters. Unfortunately, this takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where roving gangs of whimpy twenty-somethings look for people to annoy! Paul is ""terrorized"" by one such gang, led by a gangly Ted Danzen look-alike w/ official 80s gangmember hair! Luckily, Patricia (Demi Moore!!) is on the scene to assist Paul in his endeavor. PARASITE is another wacky Full Moon production that I just had to have. It sits prominantly next to HIDEOUS!, BLOOD DOLLS, PUPPETMASTER, and HEAD OF THE FAMILY on my schlock-shelf. While not as crazy or endearing as these other classics, PARASITE is worth a watch on some lazy saturday afternoon..."
1,The most boring book I have ever read,"A waste of time and money. The information is in this book is repetitive and badly presented. The writing style is boring to the extreme. Having passed seven exams and this being my last, this book almost put me off continuing."
1,Very disappointing.,"I purchased this ""Jigger"" for my bar. Though well made, a ""Jigger"" is 1 1/2 oz. This ""Double Jigger"" measures 3/4 oz on the small end and 1 1/4 oz on the other end. So it is not a ""Jigger"" I have no idea why they used those measures."
5,"Nice, inexpensive",These pens are exactly what I needed. Somehow my pens always disappear. But these were cheap and they write very well.
5,"great story, classic limits episode","this episode more than any other sticks out in my mind when i think of the outer limits. its a moving story, one that gets you caught up in feelings for the main character and is very memorable. if you want to experience what this show was about, the limits that is, this episode is the epitome in my opinion. but really, how can you go wrong with ANY of them??"
5,Breathtaking,"Beautiful! Listening to this, for me, evokes images and feelings of the Master crafting his art in ""The Potter's Gift"", the inexorable flow of life towards it's goal in ""The River's Secret"", and profound patience in ""Waiting for the Moon"". John Adorney and Daya strike a note in my soul each time I listen."
4,Wordless song,"First thing in the morning I listen to the music of P.C. Davidoff, Riley Lee, Coyote Oldman, Karma Moffett, Liquid Mind, John Mark . . . It's a spiritual time for me (in the generic sense). I'm happy to have found John Adorney's music and to have another source of morning music. My criticism, which has been made by others, is that he has vocal tracks that do not wear well and take me out of where I want to be. His purely instrumental tracks are timeless; his vocal tracks are a nuisance."
1,"Where's the ""BIC round stic GRIP fine"" GONE??","This is not the same quality as the ""BIC round stic GRIP fine"" I've been buying for years but can't find any more! The ''GRIP"" is the only pen I found that would always work to apply my signature to the reproductions I make of my wildlife carvings. The ""Round Stic F"" does not work! Poor ink? Bad tip? I don't know. Poor quality? Yes. Stand up BIC! Where did the ""GRIP fIne"" go?"
3,Dissappointed,"Throughly pleased with Randall McCutcheon's other 3 Minutes A Day book for the SAT essay, I purchased this book with high hopes. While this book was far more interesting than other books, the lack of examples and obvious tips made this book not very helpful. Then again, one does have to realize that it is difficult to be both concise and comprehensive. For a quick review of the verbal section, this book is great. However, if you need intensive help with reading, I would suggest a different book (or just more practice). The practice passages in the end particularly irked me. The passages were informative and interesting, with one or two follow-up questions. These passages, however, are not reflective of the real SAT, which usually has obscure or boring passages. This book is a fun read, but lacking in true practice material."
5,Definitely Worth Your While,"The SAT Essay and SAT Critical Reading books made me feel like it was actually possible to be successful in my test taking. Whereas the other study guides and test prep books I used did more intimidating than teaching, these books lay out what you need to know in a straight forward, easy-to-understand format. Forget all the fluff and lengthy explanations that are more trouble than they're worth. If you have four hours to spend studying for standardized tests every night for the next 3months, good for you. If you are a busy high school student who wants to do well on the SAT or ACT, and have a life as well, these books will do the trick. Oh yeah, they're really funny too."
2,needs to be more durable,"It looks nice and keeps my kitchen from smelling with the compostable waste in it. However, it is very delicate and the lid has already cracked from being dropped about 6 inches onto a laminate counter top. For something I use every day while doing dishes (and thus have wet slippery hands) I would like something a little more durable. If you aren't as accident prone though it would probably work fine for you."
3,The handle negates all the positives,"This compost keeper does look fine on the countertop unless you remove the handle. The fluted sides look positively elegant.Unfortunately, the handle is so poorly designed that it is a constant struggle to deal with, and so you really ought to remove it. Don't worry, it comes off all by itself-- frequently. At that point you'll have a funny-looking composter that has to be carried with two hands.Foolishly, I did *not* remove the handle, and kept struggling to put the handle back on. Today it finally came off while I was carrying it, and that was the end of the compost keeper. A one foot fall to vinyl flooring (while full) was all it took to destroy it.I would suggest looking elsewhere, for a composter not made of ceramic and with a permanently attached handle. Or perhaps you could fashion a better handle on your own. It certainly couldn't be worse."
2,handle is a poor design,The rest of the reviewers do not lie. The handle is a very poor design. I was rinsing out the bin this morning and it slipped right off the handle and broke. I'm contacting the company now and would not purchase this again.
3,Wish I had read the reviews,"I have been eying a different kitchen composter at my local hardware store, but when I went to buy one, they had sold out. So I came here to get a similar one. This was by far the most inexpensive and the white goes very well with my kitchen decor, but like earlier reviews, the handle is very untrustworthy. I couldn't even unpack the composter without the handle falling off. It is slightly heavier than it looks, but I expect some weight with a ceramic canister. I am happy with what I got for the money, but I believe I would have splurged to get a slightly better made product."
3,works okay but needs a different handle,"The metal handle slides off the ceramic knobs too easily to be functional. A sturdy side handle would make one-handed operation much easier. Looks nice and keeps odors down, but does nothing to stop the fruit flies - they're swarming inside and out."
1,missing filters,"I was elated to receive this product today, but the box says there is a filter in the lid. No filter. Would like you to rectify this issue."
2,handles,"I compost dead mice and dead insects mainly in the Countertop Compost Keeper. I toss them into the dirt later, dead mice make a great soil enhancer for asian vine roots, be sure to burn the dead mice.If you don't dump the Compost Keeper constantly, you'll have a big fungus build up. The handles on this are really badly designed, as I was carrying a full Compost load of organic grease to be used on my bike, the Compost Keeper handles snapped right off. I also compost human waste to mix in my edible garden."
5,Works Great,"This is a wonderful product, it not only works, with no smell if you change the filters as instructed,(though I find I don't need to change them quite as often as they say to) It also looks nice on the counter.My only gripe is the Ridiculous price of shipping the extra filters, so order a lot when you do. I ordered only two, and ended up paying more for shipping than the product it self."
3,Just listened to the samples,"Of thier 'Tyranny' album and it sounds like nothing but a big racket to me, doesn't make much sense in the din and they do not sound like Motorhead because they're from England and there's a big difference.Don't mean to be critical though but the songs all sound the same.I take it as sort of sophmoric efforts at best.A lot of screaming and no rhythm."
3,The ties that bind....,"Meg chose to violate her mother's privacy, and I give her mother cudo's for speaking out and defending herself. Like Meg, Susan chose to leave an unhappy marriage; Unlike Meg, she was not making millions of dollars, and I am sure had to make some choices based on survival. How many of our mothers had the choices that MEG has now, my mother sure did not. Life is not perfect; nor is anyone. I can only hope Meg can avoid the pain of losing a parent one day without saying goodbye, like I did. I think the other reviews on this page do not show any depth of character- but then again, movie stars are ""perfect"", right? History indeed does repeat itself; good luck Daisy."
5,Aunt Dimity's good Deed,The Aunt Dimity series is a lot of fun and I enjoy the books very much. Cudos to Ms. Atherton!
3,nothing special,"This sandpaper is no better than my 3M sandpaper. It actually has a thinner paper, tore quicker and is more expensive. I see no reason to pay a premium for it."
5,"Yes, it is faster and longer life","I've liked this sandpaper ever since I discovered it 3 years ago. It makes the tedious job of sanding almost enjoyable.It is much faster cutting and much longer lasting than ordinary sandpaper. 150 grit is perfect for general use.Klingspor has a similar ""Zinc Stearate"" sandpaper for a good price if you buy a 50-pack."
3,Ouch!,"Handle really does get unbelievably hot! And who wants to fuss with that silly potholder all the time (now included and none too attractive). Plus, the whistle sounds like an air raid, or something equally ominous. So not worth a hundred clams. This baby's going back."
3,Works fine,"Honestly I really only needed the E20 socket. Since this set was close to the cost of buying a single E20 socket, I thought it better to have the other sizes just in case. There is no detent pocket in the drive square so the sockets might slip off your ratchet if the fit is not tight.External TORX sockets seem to always have a ridiculous amount of relief (beveled portion near edge) that reduces engagement contact in some cases. I ended up grinding down the E20 socket to remove most of the relief. The differential bolts I had to use it on are not tall enough to get extra contact. The relief had to go. Not a problem for most cases but just what I ran into for my particular needs."
2,Now You See It,"What started out as promising and gripping turned unbelievable and flimsy by the end. That he'd receive a note from Jhensen that just ""fell"" out of his folded shirt was highly implausible to me. This and the fact that there wasn't nearly enough character development of Jessica to have empathy for her situation, made it very disappointing as it began to wind down. I wanted to understand her better so I'd know why she'd do this to someone that loved her and that she supposedly loved, but I thought the last chapter was a complete copout, by both Jessica and the author. To make what she did look okay and acceptable and even a little noble, when really all it was was weak and selfish showed a lack of character all the way around. I thought David was well-drawn and felt for him, but just didn't get some of the other characters. I might try another book, but I was definitely let down in the end by this one."
1,The Worst,"I have never listened to her new c.d. and already I know that the c.d. is the worst. I hate Britney Spears. She used to be so very good, shes changed so much and so has her music, for the worst. I agree with that person that I wish I could give this no stars. She will and is not ever a role-model. ..."
2,Think.,"I'm not listening to all the fans who buy every single album she's recorded. Basically, I admire the way her voice sounds on a few songs, but I'm a Slave 4 U is not one of them except when she's talking and not singing.I'm no real fan of Britney, but I think she is actually quite a good artist, and when I heard that she had released a new single I thought that I might like it, since I like her new albums better than her old ones. But when I heard the song, I could not believe that Britney Spears could actually sing like that. For one thing, the song doesn't have much real melody. I admire the meaning underneath the suggestive bits, but Britney is such a pure and innocent girl, and I really think that she should stop singing about sex if she wants to maintain her image as The Saint."
4,Guilty Pleasure No. 715,"The overwhelming majority of material from Britney is just mind-blowingly bad. This much, most of you already know. But Spears hooked up with groovemeisters the Neptunes for this delicious piece of Prince-inspired funk. If His Royal Badness continued making good records, he might come up with something like this. Britney's voice is still lacking on this single, but the groove is too tight to resist. Indulge today, but you may hate yourself in the morning."
1,BRITNEY PLAYS SEXCARD/CAN'T SHE LEARN FROM DEBBIE!,"Britney Spears is back....yes back with her first single from her self-title CD ""Britney"" (how original).Now Britney plays the sex card with ""Im A Slave 4U"", though the song has a good dance beat and good hooks it is just pop disposable garbage.Britney should learn from her pop star predecessor Deborah Gibson formerly Debbie Gibson that playing the sex card does NOT help ones career(...)However with Britney she keeps trying to push the envelope especially with this video, and a wardrobe only a gypsys mother could love.(...)"
5,Disapperance of Aimee,"One woman torn between secret passion or the religious conformity of her career!Faye Dunaway is Aimee Semple McPherson, a flamboyant yet complex woman loved by millions but still remaining an enigma. At the peak of her career Aimee mysterously vanishes!When Aimee suddenly re-surfaces after a prolonged traumatic absence, she is put on trial to prove her innocence in a sensational and fiery court case of the decade, where the truth about Aimee Semple McPherson is finally made known.Bette Davis superbly portrays Aimee's domineering and over-powering mother in this riveting drama. The Disappearance of AImee probes the hidden secrets of Aimee's life."
5,Two of the greats,"Well this is quite something. The DVD cover might lead you to believe this is old grainy black and white film of Webster. But no, its colour film taken from a concert in Hanover in December 1972.Sadly Ben Webster only lived 9 months after this recording. However if his playing isn't as fluid as it was back in the 50's its a joy to see him here, still in fine form. He's backed by the Oscar Peterson trio, with the late Neils Pedersen on bass.They play:1. Poutin' (a Webster original)2. Sunday3. I Got It Bad and That Aint Good4. Perdido5. Come Sunday6. For All We Know7. CottontailThis part of the DVD lasts 55mins, the sound is good, and the playing is superb. As a bonus there are 3 extra tracks, ""Ben's Blues"" ""In A Mellow Tone"" and ""Autumn Leaves"" (a Peterson Piano solo). These tracks are audio only and were not filmed by German TV.For any Jazz fan this is an essential purchase."
3,"what, no postscript?","this is a warning for the would-be buyers of this (nice) large-format inkjet.Although it is advertised as a ""Postscript printer"" IT IS NOT! The language this printer understands is some PCL3 flavor (reportedly with an option card for HPGL/2 -- NO BUILT-IN POSTSCRIPT INTERPRETER)What you get for the ""PS"" suffix is a driver disk for WIN DOW S ""with RIP software"" -- rip it is. If you are a Unix/Linux user I guess you shouldn't part of the extra 400-500 monetary units unless you know (?) exactly what you are doing."
3,Great To Pop In,"I'm not going to write this review with intentions of shooting anyone down about why you like this record and what that means about your image, etc. It's quite silly how reviews lately are just plagued with people who think they know exactly what's what.What I will give you is my honest opinion of this record. Great album. I gave it sometime on this one to let it grow on me and not just feed you about how catchy a few songs on the record are so far. It's nothing I would file with my ""awesome-est of the awesome albums ever"". But there is still evidence of an awesome songwriter here, (Cure influence? **** yeah!). I just found it too much of a euphoric punch to the face. It's great to throw in bob your head along to the music, but nothing I ever really found myself singing along to. Still a solid album, and I recommend it, and can see why these guys have fans."
5,It grows on you (and just keeps growing),"This is an album that struck me as good when I first heard it - but it wasn't immediately an album that I would put on repeat and listen to for hours. However, I found that one by one the songs grabbed me, and I went through phases of putting tracks like ""Turn a Square"" and ""Kissing the Lipless"" on repeat and they just get better every time I hear them. I've had the album now for about 8 months, and have only recently been grabbed by ""Gone for Good"". It's such a diverse and multi-layered album that listening to it and appreciating it is really quite a long drawn out process.I've only listened to ""Oh, Inverted World"" a few times and so far it's not getting me the same way ""Chutes"" does, but I'm sure that like with ""Chutes"", it's just a matter of time."
5,Incredible!,The shins made something almost perfect. Those songs are so simple and cool. I'd like to have other cd so good as this one.
5,Best album i've bought since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"I can't even describe how great this album is. You just have to buy it, put it in your CD player, and be blown away - just like I was."
2,lame and tame,It has that garage band sound with lame and tame singing that leaves me limp. Where's the get up and get at it? Don't you go placing this CD along side Franz Ferdinand. It will sink like the Titanic.
5,Happiness in its purest form...,"I did not know much about the shins before I got ""Oh, Inverted World"", but now, after two albums, I am addicted. Although I really enjoyed the insane genius that was Oh, Inverted World, I love Chutes almost as much. If anyone wants fun, melodic, artfully done music, check out the shins."
4,Classic Jangle Pop,Chutes Too Narrow is a little slice of classic pop served up acoustic jangle style that is instantly likable. James Mercer sounds alot like Rivers Cuomo from Weezer to me. If only this CD were longer it would (probably) warrant 5 stars.[DW]
5,speechless,"like kissing the lipless, I'm speechless - how good are this band? I SOOOO can't wait until the 6th of Feb when I finally get to see them :)This album IS beyond doubt the best of 2003"
5,so says I,It's the best Beatles album in the world. Great from start to finish. No need to embellish any further.
3,This unsophisticated hack...,"... only halfway liked this album. I suppose it would require a number of listens or a predisposition to liking indie music in all its forms. I just don't like this album that much. I certainly don't hate it, and I probably enjoy it more than 19 of 20 albums I could pick up in any given record store, but the music just doesn't hit me. Clever lyrics are one thing. But there's something missing."
3,Chutes.,"me, personaly, the first time i listened to this album, the songs popped out and bit me on the eardrums. they latched on and crawled into my brain leaving me powerless to stop my lips from forming the words to these horribly delightful songs.i wondered the coast for days pondering aloud to myself what the hell going down a narrow chute had to do with my life and how can i avoid getting cought in a fight that takes place in a sack?'chutes too narrow' sounds like a product of the love child created by the beach boys and modest mouse. can't imagine what that sounds like? then buy this album and see for your self.this is a great theraputic album for youngin's suffering from mood dissorders, sexual frustration, boredom, ADHD, overactive imaginations and seasonal depression...(i think i just basically described myself and every young adult in america...)i hope my review was helpful...-H"
5,Pleasantly Supprised,"I was looking to get all the cd's in the in the set, the library only had two,the set came with three and I also wanted the book that was written about this and found it in the package. Good Deal"
1,Old Jazz Fan,"5 STAR for the music and 1 STAR for the reproductions.The music is the greatest! However, the quality of the CD's were horrendous. I have records that are 50 years old, played hundreds of times, that sound better! No matter if they used CEDAR or any other method of restoration, they sound lousy to me!!!"
5,"A gem of a novel, masterfully written","In the novel, Flutter By, Cindy Bell has created a masterful tale of two little girls, a promiscuous mother and her abusive live-in boyfriend. As told by Dell, the younger of the little girls, Flutter By is an excellently crafted story that takes the reader deep into the world of an abused and neglected child who, along with her half sister Lucy, discovers that kind and generous people do, indeed, exist. Sometimes poignant, sometimes frightening, the story evolves around the most wonderful of friendships and the discoveries that the girls make about themselves and life. The surprise ending is a classic. Don't let the length of the novel (85 pages) fool you. Ms. Bell packs more great prose in those pages than most authors do in much longer novels. Flutter By deserves to be on all the best seller lists. I cannot recommend it more highly. Bravo, Cindy."
5,"Wonderful camera, you can't go wrong","I bought the Coolpix L1 in 2005 and it's still my ""go-to"" camera today. Probably because it's always in my purse! Simple to use, easy to change batteries when needed. Sharp images and color is vibrant. It's the one that I use for those spur-of-the-moment photo sessions. No image stabilizer so you need to hold it steady to prevent blur. Also you need to check your settings when turning it on as it doesn't revert to auto mode when powered off. I LOVE this camera and plan to use it until it breaks (if it ever does!) I do a lot of closeup photography of flowers and this does a nice job. I added a few pictures to the image gallery. I've never used the video function so I couldn't offer an opinion on that. I paid quite a bit more for this than it is selling for now but would buy it again in a heartbeat even at the higher price."
2,Very poor quality,Moses basket stand is not well made. There is a plastic border that surrounds the basket. The border cracked in 2 places during assembly. This stand is also very difficult to assemble. Four of the 8 support screws will not screw in all the way. Attempting to tighten them only strips the screws. I would not recommend this basket stand.
1,About as bad as a Civil War book can get,"That a book purporting to be a detailed, comprehensive tactical study offers only one map pretty well reflects the carelessness, and lack of respect for the reader, with which this book apparently was produced. I've written thirteen books on the Civil War and Indian Wars myself, and I understand the importance of good maps. The prose also is sloppy, and the author repeats the same absurd premise - that a few more men in the ranks of one regiment might have changed the course of Gettysburg, and thus of the Civil War - so many times that one feels tempted to toss the book across the room. An absolute disgrace to the field of military history."
2,wasted words and no maps,"The author, who did a good job with Burnside's Bridge, repeats himself over and over ad naseoum and fails to include maps or drawings to illustrate what he is describing. His main premise is, that had the 15 th Alabama been fully complemented with men and had it been supported by another regiment, Gettysburg would have been a Confederate victory. That is prepostorous, considering the number of reinforcements the Union had. Oates and his men deserve a lot of credit for their valor but so do the Union troops who put up one hell of a battle from prepared defensive positions. The author is capable of writing a much better product and must have been in a hurry to churn another book out."
1,JUST ONE,"Note the small print -- it's just ONE pepper, not 3. Also, these look like the kind that cut and split into 2 velcroed parts from the picture -- they are NOT."
2,funny shape and really tiny,"This cucumber is really small, smaller than my index finger. It's also an odd shape, not like a cucumber at all. It looks like a tiny zucchini or an odd shaped green bean. It's really out of proportion to other haba foods. The lemon, for example, is larger and longer. Many haba foods are disproportional to one another to keep them generally the same size but this cucumber just looks odd next to the other foods. If you're looking to build up a collection of haba play foods this might be one to skip. On a positive note, it is the same high quality wood and great workmanship as other haba foods."
2,Dried up,"Uni-Ball Vision Rollerball Pen, Micro Tip, .5MM, Black Ink SAN60106Bought a box 8-10 months ago. Half are now dried up and will not write (pens I haven't even used yet!). I'd think the ink would last longer."
1,Item shipped was not what I ordered,I ordered a OS-X Mac version and was sent a Window's version; I am awaiting contact from the vendor on my request for exchange.
5,BEST GAME EVER!!-Comicbook guy,This game is so tigahit! It allows all the fun of Worms with all the fun of a DS! Get it now.
1,"NOT the original, Cheap for TV remake","CHILDREN OF THE CORN was my very first horror movie and R-rated movie back in 1988. I watched it with my father against my mother's wishes, so it reminds me of him. When I saw this for cheap I thought, ""Why not?"" Here's why not:This isn't the Stephen King classic. This is a Made for SyFy piece of crap on a crap cracker with a tall glass of diarrhea soda. I mean, the corn ""field"" is like a 2-plant thick garb of plants with 3 or 4 crosses in the middle. Not to mention in this go 'round the ""corn"" proper is not what's possessed, actually nothing is, just the kids are very backward and creepy.You don't want to see this. You know how you think that you're a wee bit interested at this point? No. You're not."
1,I can say without a doubt this movie was Absolutely Horrid!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has to one the worst made for TV movie I've seen, never mind it was a remake of a Stephen King Classic. The lead actress really overacted her part, but I really can't blame her with the script she took her lines from. The children aren't even in the least bit scary and the little boy who played Issac recites his lines like he's still trying to remember them. There is absolutely no atmosphere, eeriness or creepiness which the original movie had an abundance of. This version is stale and falls flat on its face. The male lead is the only one who is even slightly believable. Who wrote the script? I had to keep asking myself did they write this for adults."
5,Great Fine Point,Finally found a fine point pen that doesn't smear or smudge and feels good inmy hand. Love it.
4,Mostly wonderful,"Yes, Neil Diamond is Jewish. If you can't get past that, don't buy the CD. If you can, I enjoy most of this CD. I have to say, I do agree with the description of his rendition of ""White Christmas"" as being dreadful. Most talented musicians bring their own interpretation to ""standards."" Otherwise, they would be very little reason to buy more than one Christmas music CD. Sometimes the new interpretation works, sometimes it doesn't. I think ""You Make it Feel Like Christmas"" sounds like it was written for Neil--very reminiscent of his classic sound. Highly recommended if your CD player can be programmed to skip a song."
1,Hot August Christmas,"Neil has to be kidding us, and he is (though he doesn't know it). With no interpretive vocal stylings whatsoever, this is Live 1972 Neil on every song. 48-year-old housewives everywhere will continue to swoon and gush, but even those of us who consider Headed for the Future a classic comedy album will find few laughs here. It's just too depressing."
1,Christmas in Hell,"It's almost impossible to find the low point on this cd, and that's because they're all low points. This one is a travesty; an album so bad, so melodically vacuous, so uninspired and derivative, it deserves a special place in the pantheon of bad Christmas music (or the trash can, take your choice). Hear Neil ""Three Note"" Diamond savagely butcher such standards as Silent Night and The Christmas Song. Hear John Lennon spin in his grave as Neil treats Happy Christmas (War is Over) with all the delicacy and grace of a charging rhinocerous. And let's not forget that virtual note-for-note rip-off of Bruce Springsteen's Santa Claus is Comin' to Town. As the crime against nature that this album is, it still didn't stop him from putting out another collection of anti-holiday cheer only a few years later. Play this one on Halloween instead and scare all the kids away."
1,Painful to listen to....,"I've been a Neil Diamond fan for about 28 years. I have seen him in concert a few times. Having said that, I have to say that this Christmas album was a mistake for him to do. It's just plain painful to listen to. His voice just doesn't lend itself to the songs on this CD. Sorry!"
1,Does NOT work on XBOX 360,"I bought this under the search for X BOX 360 games, but it will not work on 360. It is one of those not supported. So a waste of good money!"
3,This book is good for a beginner with no computer knowledge,"This book is a very well presented book. However the order of the topics in which they are presented may differ from person to person, I feel that the topics were not arranged all that great. However one can read the way he/she wants. Overall the book has a lot of examples and exercises which help you to learn the material very well."
4,A good book !!,"This is a great book, it sets up some very essential fundamentals that a java programmer should know. It covers many important topics and is well illustrated with exaples. A must buy for begginers"
3,Bic smudge if use highlighter,"These Bics are functional pens but as luck would have it, I need to use yellow highlighter often over ink and when I do - this pen's ink smudges."
3,Too skinny for me,"I was really looking for the fatter version of this, (which I have bought before and it was perfect)., These just aren't as comfortable. Other than that, they're fine. My mistake."
5,great pens,"i like pens and for a long time i have been spending more money on pens than i needed to because most pens either didn't write smoothly, or they were uncomfortable to hold or they were poorly made . pens break in my pockets because i'm a big man. these pens are inexpensive, and comfortable, and they write smoothly. they still break in my pocket, but what can you do about that?"
3,ink runs out fast,"I like the rubbery barrel + the smooth ink delivery + the retractable ball point tip, but I go through these fast, about one a month. I don't think I write that much, about 6-7 full notebook pages a day."
4,Our Favorite Christmas Album,"Fun and relaxing! Smooth harmony, really gets you in the mood for the holidays...helps maintain sanity in shopping traffic. Listen to ""Snowfall"" while watching the outside become white..."
3,MT's Sleepy & Dreamy Christmas Album,"I enjoy MT very much so I was not expecting to be disappointed when I first played this CD a few years ago. Although MT's smooth vocals and trademark harmony are superb as always, I was hoping for a little more *punch* overall. I agree with a previous reviewer in that ""even Tony Bennett can't seem to save The Christmas Song"" from lulling listeners into a mild coma. However, if you wish for a quiet, dreamy Christmas night while snuggling by the fire with a brandy and a loved one, this might be JUST the sound you need.Of course, if you ever find yourself hosting an endless Christmas party where those last few guests are STILL lingering, try playing this CD for them.** My Favorite Track: #6 Caroling, Caroling"
5,The Christmas Album,"I heard ""Snowfall"" on the radio, knew it was Manhattan Transfer, and that's all it took for me! Put on the song, and your mind will drift to winter, no matter what time of year it is. A good collection of music. Their harmonies are as clear and crisp as ever. Good job. Five stars!!"
1,Terrible,"I usually really enjoy Manhattan Transfer's music, but this effort is an EXTREME disappointment! The singing is slow, drawn out, boring, lacking in spirit, and all around painful to listen to. Too bad such a usually great group put out such a poor Christmas album. Please try again Manhattan Transfer; I'm sure you can do MUCH better!"
5,Fine Britsh historical drama,"This is a must for anyone interested in everything British. A fine miniseries with a perfect cast and generally first class acting, including many dear actors like Edward Fox and the late Nigel Hawthorne. They all make the story from the 30's as authentic and believable as humanly possible."
1,Possible fake,Watch quit working after about a month. Took it to a dealer and they said that they will not work on it due to the issues it was having. they said it is possibly a fake
5,Excellent movie,This movie portrays a question that is still debated by experts - who really wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare? Well worth watching.
3,History Run Through a Blender,"I believe there is a strong case for Edward De Vere, but this movie does much harm to that case. While sometimes visually beautiful, the movies is a hodge-podge of mangled historical facts and outright lunacy. All characters appearing in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. The sound is bad, too."
5,Awesome movie!,"A bit confusing at times, but if you're really intuitive you'll get it on the first shot. If not, then eventually you will figure it out (like me). Awesome story line, and really thought provoking in general. I'd watch it again and again :)"
4,"This band may try a little too hard, but...","overall, it's a good buy. I bought this CD when it first came out on the strength of the song ""Cruelty"" which is very good. There are quite a few other good songs on this album, but with 17 or so tracks, there is definitely some filler, be warned.The band sounded somewhat like Depeche Mode meets Bauhaus, to use two oft-cited bands. The lead singer has a decent vocal range, which goes well with the music, which borders on delightful New Order-esque synth pop at times."
4,exciting yet exausting,There are not many words for this album mainly due to its diversity. One minute it is full of angst and the next listless and lethargic. It contains vivid lyrical displays along with energy that may make or break you. This album is truly a voyage down the road of modern synth pop mixed with a whole lot of that goth darkwave we love. No doubt a specacular buy.
4,Polder Shower Caddy,"This is a great product, sturdy and well built. Lots of room to store stuff and a great price."
2,The item depicted is incorrect.,Ramline's synthetic Mauser stocks look nothing like this. You will be very disappointed if you order this stock expecting the 'monte carlo' style stock which is being advertised. The Ramline Mauser stock mimics that of a Steyr Scout with a sort of rumpled look and a built-in scope base (which is not stable enough for serious optics use).
5,Leverage Says It All,Love the caste. Great personality and acting. Unique team concept. I like the fact that they are using their skills to help other people. It demonstrates what people with individual skill sets can accomplish when they work together.
5,Leverage: The Third Season,"What I also like about this show is that it is not dark and seedy. While there is violence, it is not gratuitous. And, so far, there have been no plot lines that involve stalkers or other misogynistic individuals. One can only hope it continues that way.While there are great special effects, great sets, great actors and great acting, etc., I find that it is the writers who deserve the lions share of praise for concocting such an enjoyable storyline.I am REALLY looking forward to more ""Leverage"" episodes! 10 out of 10"
5,Great TV Show,This show is consistently fun to watch. The third season is no exception!! I recommend it to any Tim Hutton fan!Leverage: Third Season
5,Superb!,"Leverage is a well-written show with an amazing cast. It's action-packed, fun-filled episodes are a viewing pleasure and the show has a rabid fanbase. Check it out, you won't be sorry!"
3,scratched,It came quick. It was very scratched but it did play in my cd player and the cover was as it was described.price was fair.
2,NKJV not KJV,It was advertised as a KJV bible when in fact it was a NKJV wich is what I did not want.
1,Kill Clues,"One of the most sloppy mystery novels I've ever read. The characters are all over the place. I frequently wondered if the author attributed dialog/feelings to one character when he intended to attribute them to another. Don't waste your time on this book, fellas."
4,Great vocabulary builder utilizing word roots,This book groups English vocabulary words in accordance with their roots. Memorizing the Latin and Greek roots worked wonders for me in my high school years. To this day I reap the benefits. Recommended!
3,"Um...I know I'm a little rough, but...","I bought these shoes because I'm an aspiring hipster and I thought they would make me cool. Well, they did, but they started falling apart after about two month. I have pretty wide feet, but these fit me fine. They just decided one day that my feet weren't getting enough ventilation, I guess, so they popped open on the sides and just above my big toes. Now they're even more comfortable, but I look like a vagrant--which is very hip, I guess."
1,Didn't like them on me,"I had seen these on someone else and liked them but they had smaller feet, maybe that made a difference. They also seem very flimsy. I ended up donating them. Someone else will appreciate them, I'm sure."
2,Very Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!,I love Joe to death but this CD was not at all what I anticipated. Save your money on this one and go listen to his old one (All That I Am).
3,What happened??,"I must say i was anticipating a better album (since his last 2 were very good) but i was disappointed. There are some good songs on here like ""what if a woman"", ""let's stay home tonight"", but the other songs are just half-a**. Not very pleased with his song selection. I wish he would've done a better job in choosing the songs like he use to(f.e. All the things( your man won't do). Hopefully in the future he will come out with a better album."
5,Definately Better Days,This cd is awesome. I did'nt think he could have done better than the two previous cds but he surprised me. This is a great buy especially since R&B seems to have taken a nose dive these days.
3,Go O-Zone,"I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the Dragostea Din Tei video and wanted to hear more from this band, which sadly has already broken up. The CD is worth the money for the english version of Dragostea Din Tei alone. I found the lyrics beautiful in English as well as whatever language they sing in normally. The rest of the CD has nothing much of interest to me."
1,Not a documentary,"I was looking forward to seeing a thought provoking documentary when I pressed play last night but instead found nothing but a hatchet job that amounted to little more than an hour long GOP commercial that plays loosely with the facts and really makes a weak case. For example, TARP was passed and signed into law by then President Bush in October 2008, but the film portrays the bank bailouts happening as a result of Obama taking office. The film is a series of segments showing Democrats and Independents who voted for Obama but are now sorry that they did. Ultimately, the remorseful voter premise falls short because of a lack of any other supporting material. There is absolutely nothing new here that you haven't heard already. This film doesn't even cover the normal GOP talking points well. This is not a documentary but an hour long PAC commercial that isn't done that well. Don't waste your time."
1,Falling apart,"I've had this phone every since it had been released... its been about 9 months. i loved it at first, it had all the average normal things i needed on a phone. and then the vibrate broke. just one day it stopped working. and now just two days ago the outside screen that shows the time and whose calling is blank. theres just nothing there. so now i cant tell whose calling. and when im in class i cant tell when someone calling without opening it. it sucks. dont they make a good solid cell phone any more???UPDATE: shortly after the outside screen went blank, the inside screen went blank. i couldnt see anything. but ofcourse with cingular, they just will give you a new one, woo hoo i want another phone just like the one i have thats broke."
2,Good phone UNTIL the screen dies on you!,"Overall I liked this phone - until a weeks after the warranty expired the screen DIED! Yes, folks - the internal screen on these phones have a 1 yr lifespan...Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use it for less then 1 yr!I am not kidding."
4,"Cute Monkey, very soft and sweet looking.","A little smaller than I expected (but not tiny). Very very soft and cute. Packaged in a clear plastic bag and a plain cardboard box, it doesn't make a good gift package. But other than that I am very satisfied."
4,Great bang for the buck,"For the money, you can't beat this TV. I sell the initial TV's quite often, and have never had any problem. Great picture, easy to use."
4,Part Two of a Trilogy,"This was probably my least favorite of the trilogy. It's a sad story of a boy forced to live on the streets after his alcoholic stepfather throws him out. I give it 4 stars because of the lack of Laureano Olivares in the film but you get to see Pedro Lander & Néstor Terán in a different light from what we saw in ""Sicario"". It's mostly children fighting to survive in the streets. The adults are part of a parallel story."
4,Decent value for the price,"We bought this for our guest bedroom which already had a pretty nice futon mattress. If you had a cheap mattress or a thinner one, you might be able to feel the slats since they are fairly thin and spaced about 6"" apart. My husband and I are both engineers and fairly handy, so we didn't have much trouble putting it together even though the directions were pretty awful. The frame is fairly lightweight at about 55 pounds (our wooden futon frame is well over 100lbs) and we were a bit worried about strength, but with a mattress on, it seems pretty sturdy.We have about a 50lb mattress and it slept 2 adults without much flexing, but if you anticipate larger people or *ahem* active people, you might want to look at something a bit stronger!"
2,VERY uncomfortable futon frame!!,"we purchased the evolution futon frame (queen) to use with an 8"" mattress -- going with an all metal frame because of severe allergies & multiple chemical sensitivities -- the round bars of the frame are spaced too far apart (approx 5/8"" diameter and > 5 inches apart) -- you can feel them thru the mattress (due to design, there's no way to add further support slats) -- causing back pain for my husband and hip pain for me... we eventually just moved the mattress to the floor for laying on and the difference was immediate relief!! now we're having to shop for another futon frame that has slats of appropriate width & spacing.we are EXTREMELY unhappy with this purchase!!!"
4,"same problem, but they remedied it","When I received my single pen, not 12 I contacted the seller and they apologized, tried to call and sent the correct amount. A full box even."
4,SS,"While not for everyone, this is an excellent movie (in my opinion). The title refers to the hope/expectation of clients of call girls, but the same fantasies and hopes are part of the life of the main character, a high-class call girl. She thinks she is sophisticated (wears La Perla), but she is naive and easy prey of manipulative people. Some consider this a comedy, and it is indeed ironic, but I found it sad, even tragic. For comparison, I consider these human-interest movies to be 4-5 stars: Running on Empty, House of Games, Garden State, Closer, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead."
1,bad,I downloaded a copy of this off the net and I must say that this is one of the lamest atempts at a wanna be cool flick you will ever come across. I came in interested because of Sasha Grey and her pornstar backstory but in all honesty her cool factor wore off quickly and what we are left with is a disaster. The girl has about as much personality as a rock and can almost act as good as one. This is a sad attempt at what could have been a great flick had casting done a much better job.
2,"Hellow, Dolly.","It is a story of high-paid sex-worker and boyfriend of her involved in the lives of others.Rather boring than sexy and provocative, it leaves New York landscapes for different movies."
4,"Interesting, brief little film","The Bottom Line:The Girlfriend Experience often feels experimental, like Steven Soderbergh is playing in his sandbox rather than making movies for the public (there's nothing wrong with this--such trifling by Tarantino brought us the hugely enjoyable Kill Bill duplex) but his offbeat and achronological film--aside from just being plain interesting--has a lot of interesting things to say about capitalism and is worth a watch.3/4"
4,Typical american woman.,"Self centered, always looking for the next best thing, no sense of commitment or sacrifice or responsibility, and no depth at all... typical ""hot"" American woman.Interesting movie though."
2,Pretty Movie but....,"This was a pretty movie to watch. The cinematographer really is great. But that being said the movie, like Miss Greys performance is just vacant. It was an interesting essay on these yuppies who are obsessed with money and themselves but that doesn't save it for me. Sasha is not a 'professional actress' (and no I don't count what she does as acting). She just seems void of emotion and just vacant. I have seen her interviewed on Tyra Banks and in real life she comes off the same way. The story could have been a lot better if say Natalie Portman of somebody who could really act was in her role. She tried and the director worked to her strengths, not having her talk too much but still...This has nothing to do with the movie but I hope the girl takes some acting lessons and gets out of what she is in. She is too young and has too many years ahead of her to be involved in what she does."
1,Painful.,"All 1 hour and 20 minutes of this ""movie"" were painful. I write movie in quotes because I was under the impression that movies were required to have a plot and purpose; this has neither. Maybe there is something here that was artistically intellectual beyond my understanding, but watch/ buy/ rent at your own risk."
2,Obnoxious singer/dumb lyrics sink a great band.,"Rage Against the Machine is a prime example of a great band ruined by an extremely annoying lead singer and unintentionally stupid lyrics. While I'm sympathetic with the politics that Rage purports to espouse, the lyrics on their self-titled debut amount to little more than empty-headed sloganeering. Even worse, the lead singer's minstrel-like attempts at ""rapping"" would be offensive if they weren't so lame. This jerk almost makes me long for Vanilla Ice.What saves this album from complete worthlessness is the band's brilliant punk-funk-metal fusion. If this had been strictly an instrumental album, I would have given it at least 5 stars. As it stands, it barely gets 2. Recommended for those who like to think about ""important"" issues, but not too deeply."
4,Bombtracks.,"This album may not have been the start of rap-metal, or nu-metal, but it no doubt influenced those genres heavily. It's got to be one of the best, and most aggressive debuts of the last 20 years. I also think that they're one of the few bands who's name reflects the music perfectly. This starts off with the 1-2 punch of ""Bombtrack"" and ""Killing In The Name Of"", and every track after is almost as awesome. ""Know Your Enemy"" is amazing as well, and guest stars Maynard from ""Tool"". The muscle of metal, the groove of funk, and the politics of punk, have forever made this disc a raging success. Their other albums are good too, but this is the only one that's essential."
5,"The militant poet in once again, check it...","There is something about this album that I can't put my finger on, it seems to have some of type of control over me. I still listen to this album just about every single day. That's how powerful Rage Against the Machine's music really is. It's completely different from many other bands out there, lyrically and instrumentally. Tom Morello's guitar riffs really are something, probably some of the best guitar playing I've heard in a long time. And of course can't forget Zach's powerful lyrics, inspired by freestyle rap. Each song from this album is different from each other, while they may carry the same political message, they're all gems to my ears. This album is the greatest thing to come from 1990s, and probably one of the greatest albums of all time."
5,The best of the two.,"This album was great. Know Your Enemy has probably the best guitar of any song ever made. Also, Wake Up also has a great guitar solo. The lyrics are very powerful, probably not as powerful as Evil Empire, but great none the less. The great guitar makes this album above the newer album, but not by much and the only critism I have of the band is that they need to produce a new album, although I have heard news of one in the making. A great buy for anyone who like the Evil Empire cd or anyone who likes this type of music."
3,Good. Lashing out at society is good.,"Zack de la Rocha's lyrics (he is the lead singer and lyricist of the group) are aiming at politics. On their next album, i'd hate to see what they say about Bill Clinton. This album is pretty good. Not as good as Korn, but pretty good."
5,An awesome album!,"The self-titled album by Rage Against the Machine is an excellent addition to any collection. Being their first, they burst onto the scene with a well composed album containing many popular songs such as ""Killing in the Name"", ""Know Your Enemy"", and ""Wake Up"" just to name a few. With its heavy metal sound and commanding tone this album gives inspiration and energy to anyone listening to it. The lyrics also add to its strengths by addressing the issues of the United State and the problems around the world. Put these two together, and you get one powerful album.If heavy rock music is your thing, this album is a must have. Whether you need something to get you pumped up and going or are looking for an excellent album containing many great hits to listen to while driving in your car, pop this in the player and get ready. From the opening with ""Bombtrack"" till the ending with ""Freedom"", just put it in and let it play through because each and every song will blow you away."
5,I think I heard a shot.,"Not only is this one of the best albums of the 90's, but one of the most stunning debuts to ever grace the world of music. It blends both rap and metal to perfection, with politcally charged lyrics and groovy, infectious guitar riffs that would make Limp Bizkit sh*t their pants. RATM is a great musical expierience. Closed-minded sh*theads need not apply."
5,Illusion,"Powerful, but hopefully one day the people in this culture learn freedom is an illusion and we need to replace aversive controls with positive reinforcement. Hopefully one day people learn to recognize subtle controls as well, and then musicians can really rage against the machine."
1,rageagainstrage,"Since it's still only July 2002 (and this came out Nov.1992),I still have time to call this the most over rated album of the last 10 years. In a few months it will become one of the most over rated albums of the last 15 years. Whew! Thank god I got in under the wire..."
1,ISN'T VERY GOOD,"This cd isn't that great. Evil empire is the best rage cd. In this cd rage isn't really rockin as hard as evil empire. Get evil empire if you want a hard, loud, and a total masterpiece."
4,Review Title,"Great CD...I love the rareness! Not too well-done and just a little bit of pink! Great taste from this Awesome New Zealand Band!! This CD arrived only minutes after I ordered online. Highly recommended especially if you enjoyed ""Horsepower"" or ""Happy Ending"". All of their albums have their own unique sound, differentiating themselves from one another."
4,Write great but smudge,"I love UNIBALL pens. (Their blue ink is my favorite shade of blue).They have a fine point tip which is great both for journaling and for doodling/ drawing illustrations.On the down side, the ink is super juicy so they smudge considerably which means you need to be careful when using them, or your paper pad and fingers will get very inky..."
4,Great Pens at a Great Price,These pens are just what I was looking for. They always write smoothly and cleanly. At Amazon I found them at a great price.
3,"Consistency is ""iffy""","I have a wide variety of ink pens and my annoyance with the cheaper pens have always been the chore of having to rewrite over a printed letter or two in order to get the ink flowing again. This brand, while cheap, tends to give me that problem if I don't write immediately with it while note-taking. If this was a problem with all roller ball pens, I wouldn't dock it for it. But, I have cheaper pens that don't give me this problem, so that's why it annoys me. The pens do write beautifully and smooth, though, which is why I still recommend them if you don't mind retracing your letters every now and then. The more expensive pens from uni-ball seem to be free of this problem though, so if you've got the cash, you might want to try one of those as well. Good luck."
2,It remains the same.,"Strange! I used this product on later 80s. And it remains in the same disturbing quality! I like Uni products for their quality except this one. Moreover refill ink is not available in the market. So, its a one time use product."
4,"Good quality, however needs a precise angle to the paper for smooth writing","I have developed a sense of brand loyalty to the Sanford Uniball line of pens. I absolutely will not use ball point pens, which have a sometimes capricious flow of ink, and which require much more pressure to the paper in order to work properly.This particular model is quite skinny (and I assume holds quite a bit less ink) than the type I usually buy:The ones they call ""Vision"". I find that you need to hold this narrower pen at a very precise angle to the paper to write fluidly with it. I suppose it may be good if you want to train yourself to adopt a more precise pen holding technique (as I am, trying to go to three fingertips rather than my usual four). However, the wider more expensive Vision pens offer overall a much more enjoyable experience, in my opinion."
1,too good to be good,"These pens have failed. Me at least. These pens work amazingly for the first few use's, but then the ball gets stuck and ink flow is intermittent, and I am forced to throw the pen out and reach in the box for another. Went through the pack in two weeks--TERRIBLE. Definitely worth spending a little more for a better quality pen."
2,okay game,"I think this is an okay game.the only thing about it is that its to long!and repetitive.the graphics are good so are the cars. I like the chrysler 330C the best, all the other ones are just okay.gameplay is oughful for example,in need for speed underground 1 and 2 you can just costomize cars as much as you want but in this game you can't.you can only customize the cars in career which stinks because the rims,bodykits,and ect. are awesome!don't spend your money to get it.rent it first."
2,Milked!!!,"Midnight Club was terrible,2 was good and 3 is being milked.How is it fun to street race in a game, no fun to me.Rockstar should stick making fun violent games that push the elevlope instead of putting effort into making a dumb, been there racing game, it should aleast be sold for 10 dollars instead of 50 because the really good games deserve to be sold at 50."
4,Nice Game Overall,"This is a great game. It could be better but i'm not complaining. I recomend this game to anyone who likes racing games. It loads pretty fast, most of the time, and has very good graphics. The only bad part that I expierenced was the sudden change in difficulty. It starts out very easy, and then after you to a certain spot in the game, it gets a lot harder. Unlike some other games were the difficulty gradually gets harder as you get further along in the game."
3,"A Little Slower Than Her Usual Fare, But Good","This wasn't my favorite Lanier book, but an enjoyable read nevertheless. I prefer the stories where the dogs are in the spotlight and the rescue scenes are fast paced. The stories in this book are wide ranging and the major theme is slow to coalesce. Still, Ms. Lanier is one of my favorite authors and her books always leave me with a good feeling."
2,Disapointed!,"I had read many short exploits on ""Shanks"" and was really excited to read a full book on his exploits. This book however proved disapointing. I never got the feel for his true personality. The author states that he was ""honored"" with a position in the Dragoons after West Point. The dragoons were where bottom of the barrel for West Point grads. Later on he's a Major on one page then a Colonel on the next page. It's not until 4-5 pages later are we informed that he was promoted. Many times during a battle the reader is left scratching his head asking what happened. The detail of a movement is described and the next thing you know the battle was over. What happened?I've read over 63 Civil War biographies and was disapointed in this one."
5,The world thru the eyes of freebird Gloria,"Who is Gloria ?Gloria is free, compassionate, complicated, innocent, trusting and incredibly alive.How can Gloria help me ?Seeing the world thru Gloria's eyes is a mind blowing experience. She'll give you glimpses, both of the highs and lows of being human.Where can I get one ?Other than in this book, I don't know, though I'm still looking .She makes me wonder whether there are beautiful animals like her still left."
4,very good but not perfect,"This is a very good monocular. Images are sharp and clear with hardly any trouble with reflections. Focusing is precise, although a bit sensitive because of the limited depth of field. I was disappointed because the lanyard cannot be removed. All-in-all a very good monocular."
3,Good but not white,Reliable product but image is deceiving: the barrels are NOT white; they are grey. Uni-Ball continues to be a leader in affordable and stylish writing instruments.
5,XCitation Magazine Review Nov 2006,"XCITATION MAGAZINE REVIEWS[...]After two and a half years the ""Ski Your Best"" [part 2 of Learn to Ski] is now available. It was produced by the CANSI DVD technical committee in partnership with XCZone. This comprehensive audio-visual technical guide is intended for instructors and includes: the five basic elements common to both skating and classic disciplines; global demonstrations; mechanics; progressive drills and technical checklists in skating, classic and alpine disciplines.Michael LalondeCANSI Level III Cross-Country Instructor"
2,Disappointing and Frustrating,"The box and a commercial for this gun described two features inaccurately. They stated the gun could shoot 35 feet, and that the gun's scope gave it pinpoint accuracy. However, it can shoot no more than 25 feet, and the scope didn't improve the accuracy at all. Furthermore, the dart clips keep getting stuck in the gun. I do not suggest this product."
2,What?? No illustrations,"I was very disappointed to find no illustrations in this book. There is an index of illustrations and captions for illustrations on the appropriate pages but hmmmm, no illustrations. So if you can get the feel of handwork from text alone, this book will work for you. For me, I need the visual along with the words."
5,Fantastic Book!,"This book covers how to effectivly join your Christian Faith and your work environment together through many practicle biblical examples and modern day examples. I couldn't put the book down, and felt very connected to God's plan for my company as I read it. I have used this book to aid in defining my company Purpose and Core Values as well as providing an understanding in writing to our employees about our views of the importance of People, Stewardship and Serving Others. With these new focuses in place, I believe we have set ourselves up enabling God to bless us in ways we never imagined."
1,Disappointing,The Actual barf Looks nothing like picture online and looks nothing like barf. I would not buy it again. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Does Ayoob know that his good name is associated with this?,"This DVD is garbage. Sadly, I failed to see the prior review before purchasing this incredibly bad DVD. Basically, this DVD looks like someone with poor camera skills carried a cheap videocam to some third-rate outdoor police training sessions, recorded whatever came along, loaded it on a DVD, and sold it for an outrageous price. To make matters worse, to ensure the full 60 minutes was filled, they actually took the first couple of lessons and duplicated them AT THE END OF THE VIDEO! Everything in this video is commonly discussed in the shooting magazines and forums. Stay away from this turkey!"
1,No customer support nor error correction,I purchased a touch pad from Amazon. I got the wrong model. Neither Amazon nor the the third party vendor have cooperated with me in any way to rectify the error. I recommend not buying any computer hardware from Amazon at any time.Alexander G. van Broek(510) 446-1922
5,uni-ball roller deluxe pens,"I have been using these pens for years for technical editing, and prefer them to any other. They are brighter and have a finer line than any other pen I can find. I use them with a fat rubber grip called THE PENCIL GRIP, which has solved my bursitis problem."
2,cute but not a good fabric,"These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear."
1,no such word as lollydolling,"The positive reviews are overwhelmingly ""sock puppet"" copies across the internet. For example, google together ""lollydolling"" and ""SAT""--it's the same review everywhere, and nothing else.There is no such word as lollydoll, even with your girlfriend."
5,Better Than Kaplan...,"I paid more than $800 to attend a Kaplan course to prepare for the SAT and PSAT and I came out of it feeling like I had wasted my money. For any sane student who has more to do than flip through thousands of pages of nonsense this is the book for you. At first I felt that preparing for the SAT would be more difficult, but if you follow what the authors tell you, you will see almost immediate progress. For a money conscious person like me, I especially enjoy the multiple applications of this book, which means that it won't be sitting on the shelf after I get into college. I will definately use this book to help me in my writing in the future. A reasonable study program that won't bore you to death, What more can anyone ask?"
1,Three minutes a day,This book is not very useful. It targets an audience that is probably already proficient at writing essays. High school students who need help with the essay need something simpler and more to the point of writing the SAT essay. The title of the book is deceptive. It made me buy the book.
5,"good, and useful for my son to improve writing skills","My son liked it, he is 15, does not like to study SAT much, but he finds this book every day a little bit of study, very useful, the techniques are very useful for him"
3,My First Bertrice Small Book???????,I would probably give this book a 3 1/2 stars. I enjoyed the story. Glad for the happy ending. A little boring with some of the political info but all in all I read it and enjoyed it for the most part. I have another B. Small book to read but I hope it will be better than this one???
4,The not-so-melancholy birth of brilliance,"My boyfriend gave me The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy for Christmas this year. Since I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, I thought that was EXCELLENT. Oyster Boy is the lovechild of Shel Silverstein and Edgar Allan Poe. The illustrations alone are just gorgeous. I wouldn't recommend this for children, though."
2,Gorey art plus Silverstein poems equals trite boring junk,"I like Tim Burton stuff, I really do. But Oyster Boy was a let down. It's a very small book with very little content. It has a really Gorey type drawing style, and that's always fun, but it wasn't anything new or interesting as far as creepy art goes, and not nearly as good as actual Gorey art. The stories are short; most bits aren't even a page long and read like silverstein poems.The only high point of the book is probably the multi-page oyster boy story, but all the rest are just lame attempts at being weird."
4,A unique collection of stories,This was a fun book of stories. Though I laughed at times when I probably shouldn't I must admit overall I enjoyed it. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because there were a few in there that were kinda lame and this is most certainly not a book for children. If I had known that at the time I purchased it I probably wouldn't have. This is certainly a must have for fans of Tim Burton. Another book I would recommend would beBoetryby Beau Beaudoin. He too has a collection of macabre stories written in rhyme but suitable for all ages and the illustrations are outstanding.
4,A take-off of Edward Gorey,"Most people are familiar with Edward Gorey's work, even if they don't know it: The Gashlycrumb Tinies is that twisted little alphabet book for grown-ups: A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, B is for Basil, assaulted by bears... and so on. Gorey is truly the king of gallows humor.Tim Burton has followed carefully and respectfully in Gorey's footsteps in everything he's done, from his movies to this hilarious little poetry book. Yep, it's kind of twisted, but most healthy and well-adjusted kids (aged 7 and up is probably a good guideline) will be able to appreciate the dark humor as much as you do. Get this book, you'll be glad you did, but if you don't own any of Gorey's books, get one of those, too, and you'll be able to quite clearly see the influence."
2,don't get this one,"this album is not even close to being as good as the five or so mahavishnu albums that came before it. if you're looking for a good introduction to mclaughlin's music, try Birds of Fire or Inner Mounting Flame. even if you're looking to expand your mclaughlin collection, you're better off not getting this album."
3,"THIS THERMOSTAT IS FOR 220 VOLT LINES, NOT 110!","Nowhere in the Item Description for this thermostat does it specify 220V line voltage! Thanks Amazon, for wasting my time and money!"
5,RATM = EPIC!,"This album takes it to a whole new level of awesome-ness!!!! Best album I heard in years! Makes me wonder if there will ever make a greatest hits album soon. Get this album, it's worth it and u'll love it! Great for any Rage Against The Machine Fan!!!"
5,Love this book and the pictures!,Love this book and the pictures! All the old vet books have awful pictures or no pictures at all---this really helps illistrate everything.
1,ad error,one box shipped instead of six!Amazon customer service refunded order.Yea! Amazon!Thanks for customer service
1,WTF?,"I can't understand for the life of me why this has received so many good reviews. The video production alone is so trite, played out, and repetitive that just trying to navigate through it is almost impossible. I bought this to take over where books left off. BAD IDEA. The books I have are from the 70's and they do a better job of explaining and certainly are more detailed. The video glosses over many things except skating. If you like skating, this is your video. I feel like I'm missing something...Half the video is an info-mercial for: The video. I just don't get it. Go take a lesson instead. The price is the same and you walk away with some knowledge. However, it is kinda fun to watch them clown around on XC skis. It is pretty amazing. The pros in the video really do know how to ski, but the ""how to do it"" part never gets effectively translated to the viewer. I wish Amazon would take it back."
1,Ridiculously small..,"I wish I would have paid more attention to the size of the product. I would not have purchased it had I knew of it's size. I, of course, did not expect it to be the size of a real carton as it is made of wood and under two dollars but when the carrot is larger than the milk carton it's not worth it as you really can't play with it. Glad I only purchased one."
1,I can't believe I paid for this!,"I laughed when I opened my package and saw the teeny tiny wood chip of a toy. Then I looked for the other one, but there was only one. No measurements were given so you assume it would fit into a play kitchen but it won't. Maybe I will follow the other reviewer and have my daughter use it for a coffee creamer. But seriously, don't waste your money. This product is a joke."
1,Do not order this,This milk carton is about 1 1/2 inch tall....Cost more to ship than product costs. Not good for playing kitchen for kids.
1,Read measurements before you purchase this! Picture is misleading!,I would have never purchased this had I read the measurements of the item. The picture is very misleading. I received it today and the milk carton is only 2 1/2 inches tall. I had ordered it for my daughter to play with since we are getting her a play kitchen this year. This size of this product is ridiculous for the price. Not a good choice!
1,Very small!!!!,This is not very big fits in the palm of your hand. Seems like it would work better in a doll house then a play kitchen for a 3 year old!
3,TOO SMALL.,I wish I had read the description thoroughly to see how small this was. Not quite doll size but way too small for my 4 year old. Well made though.
5,Finally durable wooden products for dolls...I love it!,"Great Milk! Not many people know that Haba products are made specifically for dolls, hence the negative reviews that I've seen. Haba kitchen products will be small to fit play for the dolls. They are wonderful! I love this product; It is durable; the milk is so cute! My 2-year old daughter loves it for her American Girl Bitty Twins!"
5,This is such a nice addtion to my kitchen,"This is such a great chopping bowl and it's so much easier to use than a regular chopping board. Everything stays inside the bowl while you chop and I can even put it in the refrigerator to keep the chopped contents cold while I cook. Clean up was as easy as the manufacturer said, just rinse it off. The only thing negative I found was that I wish it had rubber feet to keep it level on tile. My husband added some little feet within a couple of minutes so no big deal, just a thought. You will love this item and I have given a few to friends as gifts."
5,Love the Ulu,"I own this set. I bought it while in a store while visiting Alaska this summer. Bought one for my parents as a souvenior and after seeing a demonstration in another store. Decided that I just had to have one. Both of my parents love it, and so do I. Chops vegitables for salads so quickly. My 11yr old finds this easier to use than a regular knife. I love this ulu so much that I am now buying more from Amazon to give as Christmas Gifts."
2,Not very good,I purchased several of these and the last 2 times they were horrible. They would print very light and run out of ink in almost no time. I took an old one apart and used ink from a stamper and put ink on the roller inside to make them last. The new ones have a different roller inside and they won't absorb the ink from the stamper refill so i keep having to take the roller and swapping it into the new cartridges to make them work. These are getting hard to find so i don't know any alternatives. Hopefully my good internal roller won't give out and i can keep moving it into the new cartridges.
5,Chaos of the Reich's Last Days,"Many of stories like this never got told, surviving the last days of the Soviet steamroller on the Oder line and then again in Berlin surely was a chancy bet. A studied and thorough military history, Berlin Dance of Death is not. It is a stunning personal account of a young soldier in the desperate last days of the Third Reich. Altner's story reflects the crushing of the East Front, the harrowing retreat, Soviet encirclement, retreat into Berlin, the battle for the city, his escape, and final capture. He brings all this to the reader on a very immediate level."
3,Berlin Dance of Death,Very detailed and factual. Slow moving. If you like daily military unit reports you will find this interesting. Floyd McRae
1,More problems than a crack child,"Just search a lil bit online to discover the multitude of problems, recalls and abysmal experiences folks have had with this product. From faulty wirelesss and video cards to recalled motherboards this computer is well hated. I believe there is a class action against HP for knowingly offering defective devices."
2,HP Tech Support,"I bought this system for my 13 yr old homeschooled daughter for her schoolwork.From day 1 it would not complete downloads through the download manager. To load Firefox I had to download it on my Dell and thumb drive it over to her HP. She can not download music or videos. Tech support suggested I get more ram which I did. That was no help and support suggested I buy a support contract since my 30 day support had expired. I read from the warranty where software support was 90 days with registration. It made no difference, they can't understand me and I can't understand them most of the time except when they want to sell something. I actually like the system but tech support needs lots of help."
4,hey mr. wanton arborcide from iceland,"doesn't the mathematical concept of greater thancome from a human mind? sure, some birds can count and distinguish between object sizes but can they creatively abstract and apply the concept to solve other physical problems?nope. and if you think the whole book is basedon a false premise, it still has some interesting views, facts and features.does it warrant a 1 star?i mean you can learn from everything.even mistakes.i mean i learned from you just now."
2,What a waste of time......,"Lowlifes, junkies, nearly homeless kids? It's been done before, and done better. This movie made me want to just eject it, and watch Jeff Bridges and Edward Furlong in ""American Heart"", which I did."
5,Life is Hot in Cracktown,"The DvD was in excelent shape arived on time and played great, i was very impressed, Mr. R Lewis even sent me some popcorn and a lil candy so that i could have some snacks while enjoying the movie...Thanks angain...Mark B"
2,Still Has Bug(s),"I just wanted to add that Microsoft has still not fixed the bug that screws-up Transparency/Opacity. Want a graphic to show through? Too bad, it appears solid. Same bug in PowerPoint, too."
1,Do not buy the (60145) Blue Pen,"The Sanford Uniball Onyx pens are about the best pens ever made, however, do not buy the (60145) Blue. It does not work - the ink cuts out. It's possible that I got a bad batch, but really, stay away from this pen. Buy a different model number. Also, I highly recommend the Uniball Onyx Micro rather than the Fine."
4,Passable,"I thought this a solid documentary that informed me about nearly everything I wanted to know about The War of 1812. It is not spectacular but certainly is a valuable primer on a period of time often overlooked. It uses the same partial reenactment method which has made countless other History Channel productions resonate thoroughly over the years. The segments on the siege of Baltimore and the Battle of New Orleans are very well done. Indeed, I wanted to go out and read a biography of Andrew Jackson as soon as it was finished. For the amateur historian who is unfamiliar with the period this DVD will entertain and educate."
3,"Decent, but not entirely worth it.","PROS:+ affordable way to have remote, wireless triggering.+ unbelievably efficient battery life.+ very straight-forward and easy to learn the controls.+ very lightweight.CONS:- unsatisfactory range.- has to be within ""view"" of the slave light source.- any small obstructions between transmitter and receiver results in communication loss.This is a fun transmitter to fool around with when just starting out with wireless triggering and studio shooting. But unfortunately, after just a few times of using it, I outgrew it's pretty meager capabilities. Unless you shoot a lot in nightclubs or small events, I HIGHLY recommend that you instead save up more money and invest in Pocket Wizards."
2,"Okay, but not great","We got this in a pack with three other games. My daughter, who is four, played it once and hasn't gone back to it. She would much rather play Clifford Learning Activities, which is a much better game, in my opinion. From watching her try to play this and helping her, I can tell you there is much more to do and learn in a game like the Clifford one. I think limiting it to just art is just that, very limiting. Your money would be better spent on a game that not only has art, but also counting, language, logic, problem-solving, etc."
4,"Good, Beta, Best","OK, while we're waiting for the real thing, the public betas are out there being played with. Being worked with. As they were free, or a nominal charge, there's a lot of programmers working with VS.NET, especially VB.NET.This book is excellent. Well-written, full of code samples, aimed squarely at Visual Basic.It covers the Beta 1, but there is a web update for Beta 2, so if something doesn't work (mostly in the data access), then go check the web.Of limited use once the RTM ships, with that caveat I recommend this book to all serious VB developers. Get stuck in!"
4,Great Introduction,"Hate overly technical books but need the core information to simply get you up and coding VB.NET fast. Then this is the book for you. It's an easy read. They make good comparisons between VB6 and VB.NET. Hey by the time I finished this book I thought it was easier to write VB.NET then VB6.0. The information is correct and the examples are so easy to understand. This book is great as an Introduction and you'll be happy you read it. The reason I didn't give it five starts is I wanted to know even more by the time I finished it. It makes you wish your company would drop the (legacy..he..he) VB6 today and let you get in to coding VB.NET. When your've finished you will no longer avoid talking to the C programmers of this world. GO on buy it!!!, it's worth every cent....got to go ...sheep to feed."
2,disappointment,"i wrote my diploma thesis about interface design and this was the worst book i have read. the authors repeat themself again and again and again. to less info, too much blahblah. for me, this book was nearly useless (and as i live in europe i paid lots of money for it!). sorry, but i'm really upset. btw. the best book i have read was theo mandels elements of user interface design!"
4,Great tool for any level.,"This book is fantastic. It has a spiral binding so you can open to a pattern and the book wont flop shut right when you are in the middle of a stitch with your hands full of yarn and hook. The only negative about this book is the sizes of the pictures in the ""stitch selection"" part. The pics are only about 1 1/2 inches square so you can't get a very good idea of how the stitch really looks. As a beginner crocheter, I found this book easy to follow and understand and it has so many stitches that give you plenty of material to grow your skills with."
4,"easy to follow , complete with diagrams and photographs","As a person just learning to crochet, i found the detailed explanations with clear diagrams great to follow. later, when I was learning the more complex patterns, the combination of diagrams, symbols and crochet jargon, were well designed. it was satisfying to see my own results look very similar to the photographs. my minor criticism would be that there is no example articles to make using these new patterns, or little reference to how the patterns may be used for a potential wrap or hat etc."
4,Lifeforce(1985),"Lifeforce(1985) was a critical and commercial flop in 1985, but time has been kind to the film. Ideas from the film have been used in other sci-fi movies and TV shows. The film is based upon Colin Wilson's 1976 novel The Space Vampires. Henry Mancini's epic, loud, sweeping music score for Lifeforce is an underrated masterpiece! Mancini is the same guy who wrote the jazzy Pink Panther and Peter Gunn theme music! This CD also has the alternate music cues(composed by Michael Kamen) that were used in the shorter U.S. version of Lifeforce. Keep in mind that the tracks sound a little damaged! Mancini's Lifeforce theme music has been ripped off for video games and TV shows! Also, Tobe Hooper's movie has no connection to the Nintendo game Lifeforce(known as Salamander in Japan)! This limited edition CD is a must for music buffs. I hope more copies are made one day."
3,good,"This is a good science fiction soundtrqck by the great Henry Mancini.Like a lot of 1970s scores from the genre, this uses a full orchestra. This is fine if you like this, but contains none of the blues jazz or choral music that are the master's trademarks.Get this. Just don't expect your typical Henry."
5,LOVED IT,I wish I could get more of my friends to give this movie a try. Easily the best Bollywood movie I have ever seen.
3,"Works well, but not entirely leak-proof","I've been using this product for several months and was quite happy with it. The last set of packs, however, did leak. I now have a bit of discoloration inside my Martin HD-28. No damage that I can tell, but not a good thing."
1,They dry up too quickly,"I've now bought and used two sets of these (each set has three packs, one for the headstock space and two to hang in the soundhole), and each time, the humidity level reached 43% or so, only to drop to 35-37% in about ten days. The maker's own advertising touts that they'll keep humidity at 45%, where it should be. What's wrong? Perhaps the foil bags they come in are not airtight, or old? At all events, sorry to say, in my experience this product does not live up to its advertising."
4,A Right Write,"The line this substitute for the ordinary carpenter's pencil is as de-scribed by the manufacturer: crisp, clean, and on point.Unfortunately, from time to time the lead slips o-u-t and falls to the ground; however, it seems never to break: the lead is t-o-u-g-h."
1,Untapped Options &#65533; An Executive Summary of Executive Summari,"Enthralled by the thought of learning secrets to create a unique working relationship between human resources and marketing, I bought the book. However, I was disappointed early on. It was a continuing snip-it of others' work with little true insight into bridging the gulf between marketing and human resources. The authors attempted to show areas of overlap and differences and in my opinion could have spent much of the book showing how to work toward alignment between the two departments. Rather, it showed how HR must market the hospital to employees, both new and old and how marketing must use surveys to assist administration in identify patient satisfaction issues. Nothing new, especially if we appreciate and recognize the continual efforts of patient and non-patient care staff to provide excellence in healthcare - inside and outside of the four walls we call a hospital. ""Raving Fans"" is much better. VP - HR, Salina, KS."
4,A very interesting HISTORY book.,"This book is full of old stompbox pictures and interesting stories from their creators. The first part deals with the evolution of the different effects, and the remainder of the book tells the stories of the manufacturers. This really is a HISTORY book set mainly in the 1960s and 70s. While there are a number of references to artists who have used the effects in question, I would have liked more track-specific references so that I might really know what these things SOUND like."
1,Not the Real Thing,"Don't waste your time and dollars getting this album. It is not a collection of greatest hits by the artists that made the songs famous. Instead, it is a collection of unheard of artists who did re-makes of some well known, some unknown hits by these great songwriters. The only thing in common in this collection is that the company had rights to this collection of remakes done by British bands. Stick with the Smokey Joe's soundtrack until someone comes up with a genuine ""greatest hits by the original artists"" album."
3,Made for TV now on DVD,I had remembered seeing this movie on tv as a kid. This moive is filled with former abc sitcom stars. Jennifer Aniston before friends was just as atractive then as she is now if not more.
3,Get a New Measuring Tape!,"As with virtually all Canon products, the quality of this bag is excellent. Were I to rate it based upon this alone, I would give it 5 stars. HOWEVER, I purchased it based upon the dimensions clearly listed on Amazon's site, and when it arrived, it is just as clearly listed on the tag as being a critical 1.3 inches SMALLER! Hence, the item I purchased to store in it doesn't fit. I would have sent it back, but it turns out it will fit my Digital SLR with lens attached. Yet even there, my camera is the compact Pentax istD, and I only have that one lens. Those alone will fill up the bag! As another reviewer noted, there is NO WAY that the amount of equipment that the description claims will fit in it actually would. It's a case of buyer beware. Great bag--but only for smaller items!"
1,"Bag is way to small, Description is wrong","You can not fit what the product info states. Try it. This is a joke. You can not put more than one camera body with two lenses or two camera bodies with one lens in this bag. When you do, you are forcing the camera in. You cant even put the camera with the lens attached to the body and add another lens in the bag. Another thing, you can not zip the inside pocket where the manual is suppose to be stored. Funny thing, this is a Canon bag, which cant even hold most canon items including the manual. Returned mine and ordered the larger one 10EG model."
4,"Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag, a Few Flaws but Pretty Good","The bag is very sturdy, well made, and safe for the camera. There are plenty of little pockets to store things and what not, but there is a lack of space. You cannot hold as much as you are told, and it is hard to even get it in there. It works, but not amazingly."
2,Very misleading,"The bag is suppose to hold two cameras,I have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries. I recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here. might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not SLR"
4,Does the Job!,"Does just what I need it to do. Stores my camera, 2 lenses and accessories! Just wish it came in different colors as this is bit manly for me."
4,good value,Perfect size. Fits everything camera body and two lenses comfortably. Has a waist strap and shoulder strap which is convenient.
2,Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG,I found the bag to small for my needs. I have more gear than what it will hold. If all you have is the body and a lens then it would be ok. The bag is nice just to small for my needs.
4,Great for travel!,"This bag is small, but it fits my Canon Rebel XT with the kit lens and battery grip. I also carry the 50mm/1.7 lens in there and still have room for the manual, battery charger and other small components. I will be getting a bigger bag when I start acquiring more lenses, but it is great for now and for summer travel.It also looks nice and is very sturdy."
5,Great bag for the Canon S3 IS or similar,"This bag is neither too small nor too large for my purposes. This bag holds my S3, battery charger, spare batteries, car adaptor, cables, etc... Great quality; all metal hardware, no cheap plastic. Three ways to carry; padded no-slip shoulder strap, handle, and stowable waist belt. The primary compartment has moveable partitions (two) held in place by velcro. In summary, this bag is great if you have similar sized items as I listed above."
3,slightly dissapointed,we like the color of the wagon and it was easy to put together but the one thing we didnt like about this wagon was the turn ratio. the wagon when pulling will only turn slightly left and right. i guess this was a safty feature on these wagons but you would think they would have done something in the engineering of these wagons to allow for better turning. after you turn it slightly u have to lift the front up if you want to make any further of a turn and this is inconvient to say the least.on some of the pic's on the advertisement the way it show's the angle of the wheels that is about as far as they turn. you may want to consider a different brand.
5,katie,"My daughter loves looking at the options in the front cover and then picking which one to read. It gives me a good oportunity to talk about the places each story comes from and sometimes we look them up on a map! All of the stories are kid appropriate but most of them are a little longer and wordier then childrens stories, My four yr old daughter has no Tv watching in her life and so reading is one of our favorite things to do so she has no problem staying engaged, I've noticed that its a little harder for children whoa are not use to reading longer childrens stories. Because of this I think the book would make a great gift for older kids adn teens as well!"
2,Intro to development that could be half as long,"A fairly useful overview that describes the issues a developer has to address, but not much about how to address them. For some reason the author tends to repeat himself. He says something and then restates it. He makes the same point twice.He also tends to be rather vague: ""Some aspects of site supervision can be dealt with in many ways. Some ways are more cost-effective than others."" The book is full of statements like this.I have found the book useful to help me identify issues that I need to think about, but if you are looking for answers--this book isn't for you. It should be titled, ""What to Expect as a Land Developer."""
1,Nothing New Here,"Lets face it......if you know anything at all about developing land, the absolute critical item is actually finding a piece of property that makes sense to wast time pursuing. I bought this book hoping to find some insight into ways of ""finding"" that elusive ""good fit"" property that maybe I have not thought of. Nothing new here, just some odball potential sources of finding property that just waste your time"
2,Definately a text book for a course,This book reads like a university text book which is likely used in conjuction with a course the author teaches. By itself it is a little difficult to navigate the software provided due to the many many combinations of alternatives available. The appropriate abreviations needed to use the software makes it difficult at time to know which information is required. All and all I believe this book is likely a great reasource once one can master it's content.
5,Very enjoyable and is rewatchable,(Forgive any bad speling) This is by far the best anime I have watched to date and I have see a lot of them. The female lead Belldandy is sweet funny and kind and the male lead reminds meof my self witch really drew me in and got me to like the searies. The comedy is well writen in the story and does not over power it. you can't help but enjoy this searies once you watch it.
2,Easily defeated,"For $2.58 it sure can't hurt to buy one of these -- I have one and use it. Just NEVER EVER relay on a pen test ALONE!!! The problem is that it is ridiculously EASY for the bad guys to make a fake pass the pen test. I won't say how, but your jaw would drop if I told you how easy they can make any piece of paper pass the pen test.The BETTER thing to do is to check the water mark image and the writing on the security strip with a back light, and test the security strip under an ultra violet light. Amazon sells a few of these testers. Also buy a powerful magnifying glass to test for printing detail. If you like you can go even further by testing for magnetic ink (that all real bills have) with a neodymium magnet."
2,Water Filter Review,"When I purchased these water filters for my Braun coffeemaker, I believed I was purchasing the actual filters made by Braun. Instead, I was sent an inferior after-market product that does not function as well as the original. The filter actually floats inside my coffeemaker when I add water and has caused my coffeemaker to not work correctly. It now drips and sputters. Next time, I will purchase the brand product from the manufacturer."
1,Couldn't tell the difference,"Maybe I just have clean water to begin with, but I sure couldn't taste the difference."
5,Water softner for braun coffee pot,Helps with hard water deposits and limits cleaning to the coffee pot by keeping the water soft and filtering the hard Cleveland water minerals. I think the coffee tastes the best of any coffee pot I have ever owned which were basically Mr. Coffee and maybe some inexpensive off brand.
3,Model numbers that this applies to,"As of 27 October 2002, this filter fits Braun Coffee makers models KF580, KF550, KF510, KF190, KF187, KF180, KF157, KF155, KF150, KF145, KF140, KF130.If you go to the Braun Web site and want to search for your model coffee maker, be aware that Braun thinks these are two word model numbers. Their search engine wants you to enter KF + 157 for the KF157 model.The filters work. We like them more for the hard water problem than the chlorine issue. The filter does both well. Just pricey."
2,Can't find them at retail.,"I bought this coffee maker BECAUSE of the water filter. When I bought it (8 months ago), the water filters were available in the store. Now, I can't find them anywhere but on-line. I am not adverse to shopping on-line but for an item like this I don't understand why they don't just sell them in the same stores that sell the coffee maker. I mean, come on BRAUN/BRITA.....how do you say ""DUH""? And how do you say ""INCONVENIENCE THE CUSTOMER""?"
3,Braun Brita KWF2 Water Filter,"This is only a coffee pot filter - I guess it works, the flavor of the coffee is less bitter."
4,Good if you have problem water,"I have undrinkable tap water. I notice a major difference in taste when I use tap water with and without the filter. When I use bottled water I can't tell the difference. If you have bad tap water I highly recommend this filter, if you don't have bad tap water you might not notice the difference."
1,I only read the 1st 2 chapters,Way to discriptive. Everything is like something else. Sometimes a sky is simply blue or eyes are simply green. Story was lost.
3,Historically Interesting,I really don't know how historically accurate and don't know whether it was the intention of author. Certainly interesting. I do know that England in those days was a hotbed of intrigue and continual conflict.
1,Waste of money!!!,"HORRIBLE! One good scene that last about 20-30 seconds, thats it. Don't waste your money like I did. Would have gave it a ""0"" rating, but 1 star was lowest available. 100% agree with the man below about these positive reviews, has to be people promoting this DVD. IT SUCKS, its that simple."
5,The real SPRING BREAK in THAILAND!,"Wow- these 2 frat boys have put together an awesome video of babes, bikinis, and beaches! You get HOT CHICKS and a tour of beautiful Thailand. I can't wait til they release the next video, which was shot in Croatia. You guys have got to check this out!"
4,Recipes for cheese lovers,"My wife actually prefers this cookbook to the Best of the Best of Minnesota, but then she's always liked cheese.Stereotypes aside, this is another fine book in the Best of the Best series. We use the Wisconsin cookbook more than all the others. Of the recipes we have prepared, there has only been one so far that we didn't like.It features the kind of brunches, dinners, and desserts that most people will find appealing, as well as some regional favorites.Again, the book is two-color and features no photographs of the prepared items."
3,Rather plodding,"Most of the book is written in a monotonic voice, with very little insight into the people who actually carried out the work of deception. Come on, we're talking about people like Bill Blass; these guys had to be more exiting than this! It seems to me that most of the book is composed of summations of the few extant after-action reports. Although it is of good use as a reference material, it's otherwise a snoozer."
1,AAD and 35 minutes of music,"This album is a poor presentation of Andy Williams talents. This disc was not digitally remastered, so what you are getting is 1960's audio technology slapped on to a CD format. And, to top that, there is only 35 minutes of music on this disc. Even at [this low price], this is overpriced."
3,Being new......,"Being new to T'ai Chi I can not judge something like this on any type of a scale.I would have like to see more breathing information, and would have enjoy a bit more over all information on T'ai Chi it's self.It is set up so you can follow along well, and does not move on a ""hurry lets get this done"" pace."
3,Undersensitive to ambient light,"Being that it sits right next to my bedroom window, and despite when the morning sun comes right thru my bedroom window (but not directly shining on this unit however), this unit takes quite a while for the room to get real bright from sunlight before it shuts off."
2,Inflatable pump not good,"I enjoy working out using this ball, especially for ab work. The only bad thing about this product is the pump - it stopped working before the ball was fully inflated."
2,Okay until today,"I started a weight loss regimen about 6 months ago and managed to lose 25lbs, but still had a pot belly. I read that using the exercise ball would help tone the abs and as it does not cost much, seemed a worthwhile investment. The ball inflates easily enough; I had to repump every week as there was some leakage of air. The booklet that came with the ball had a few pictures, but not enough information. I would recommend a instructional DVD for anyone serious about using this. After I started using the exercise ball, I did notice my midsection becoming flatter. I still have a long way to go.So...why only 2 stars? I weigh 160lbs and the ball is rated for 300lbs...yesterday it burst. I would definitely buy again, just this time a ball with a higher weight rating."
5,Worked out good,Worked Good and lasted a long time. I have no problem recommending this product. Is as good as advertised and is decent quality.
4,I liked it,"I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is especially a great buy during winter."
3,Had high hopes...,"I'm a real weinie when it comes to being cold. I live in the mid-Atlantic so January and February can be bitterly cold. I decided to splurge on this to help avoid my typically chilly routine. Normaly, after I shower, I slather myself head to toe in lotion. Summer, winter, etc., I *always* lotion-up after bathing. I've used hundreds of products and go through them pretty quick.Good:It works! I've only had for a week or so, but it seems to heat up to a yummy temperature pretty quickly.Bad:IT DRIPS! If you leave it in one place too long, undisturbed, you'll come back to a lotion stalagmite. It's rather big, too, I can't find a place to put it on the sink in our bathrooom plus, of course, it leaks so it can't stay over, say, the toothbrushes.Seems like other people have had more success, or perhaps don't mind the leak; maybe I just got a defective unit. Overall I'm mostly happy with it so far, but that runny lotiony nose just isn't very attractive."
5,Canon deluxe gadget bag 10 EG,"This one was for me. It is perfect! All of my ""stuff"" fits. I am so excited about making some pics."
4,10 year old son loves it,"I bought this game for my son's 10th birthday, and he loves it! When he showed it to me, I thought it seemed really redundant, like he was doing the same thing over and over and over, but he and his 7-year old brother laugh like crazy when they're playing. He doesn't sit and play it for hours, like some of his other games, but he does enjoy it, and told me it lots of fun!"
4,Really Good Fieldguide,"It's a wonderful guide, but I will follow the advice of several others and have the plates removed and bound separately before I go on my trip. I cannot see myself carrying this entire fieldguide with me into the field. Carrying just the plates should work very nicely. Since I am not leaving until February, the guide offers me plenty of opportunity to acquaint myself with the birds I'll be seeing."
1,This is not a concert,"I mistakenly bought this thinking this was a live concert, Its Not. Its just a bunch of interviews and life story's"
3,Just OK,"Bought to help with stomach issues..Didn't seem to change anything and the product MUST be refrigerated upon receipt. If it turns up warm upon arrival, I was told that was OK as long as you refrigerate promptly."
4,Must have for raising rabbits.,As a novice at raising rabbits this book has been indispensable for all of my rabbit concerns. Written for the beginner to advanced rabbit person. Very informative for rodents as well.
4,Uniball vision elite pen,"When I barrowed this pen from a friend I was so impressed I drove down to Office Max and bought a few. This is probably the best pen you can get under $20. It writes VERY smooth, no scratchy lines, but no blotches either--just smooth consistant lines. It feels good in the hand and it's quite sharp-looking too. Arguably, these pens are a bit expensive, $9.00 for a pack of four, but their quality makes it worth it."
2,"They delivered pens that are great. Unfortunately, I ordered REFILLS...","This store either shipped the wrong items or described them wrong.I already had the pens and wanted refills, to save money and the environment.I got pens instead, and 1/2 as many (since pens cost twice as much). Further, they were not in retail boxes, but bulk in rubber bands, so it seems as if they are buying bulk orders and reselling them.Misleading, but returning would have cost too much to worry about (money saved out the window).Don't order from this company...(PS - and yes, I submitted the same review for different refill products because I ordered ALL of those products in one shipment and got PENS instead of REFILLS for all products ordered!!)"
2,Ballpoint is not for me,"Parker's ballpoint pens are not very good. They don't write very well or dark and are not very nice to work with.I DO like their roller-ball pens though. They're like writing with a fountain pen without all the mess, highly recommended. Though beware that some of the cheaper pens might lack durability in securing of the cap."
3,"Compelling and well researched, but heavily influenced by religion","Not sure if it is bad o good, but when some of the very good argumentation is built strictly on religious terms, if substracts from the discussion. The opening arguments, the data, and the events it depicts, are very well researched, and with minimum religious zeal (it should, for example, show the other side of Pope Pius XII), so they can be used as reference in any discussion as long as you are careful to examine some of its positions. I do recommend watching it."
3,not satisfied....,"I expected to see a documentary as a narrator is explaing the ifs and what, but for most of it, it was just Dave hunt siting there talking to you, preaching his ideas, wasn't quite satisfied with it."
5,Hoover Windtunel Deluxe Stretch Hose,I ordered this because I recently purchased a Windtunnel vacuum cleaner. It really made it easier to use the vacuum on stairs and anywhere that I needed to reach to clean. I would recommend it to anyone purchasing the Windtunnel vacuum because this makes it so much easier to clean!
5,You'll probably need this.,"This extra hose was included with my first WindTunnel, bought many years ago at Costco. I beat the tar out of that machine, using it for remodeling cleanup... and it still works. But I got a new Hoover (bagged) vac, basically just to have one that looked better. Like most uprights, the normal hose is too short even with the extension wands. You end up pulling the machine over when vacuuming the crown molding etc. This fixes the problem. Mine is 13 years old, works fine, no problems. You'll probably need an extension hose no matter whatever brand of upright vac you have (this one only fits bagged Hoover WindTunnel), so unfortunately it will be an expense no matter what."
1,stretch hose is poor,"watch out for the ""STRETCH"" version here, it constantly knocks over the vacuum cleaner....the pressure needed to lengthen the hose is more than the stability of my up-right vacuum. do not buy."
3,Nice hose,"The hose extends and retracts well. The retracting is nice when it comes time to store it. It is plenty long for stairs, draperies, etc."
1,Hoover 20' Deluxe Stretch Hose,"I couldn't believe when I received the option to share my opinion of this product, I had just cut off the vacuum- amazing. Anyhow, that hose is, just like it says, 20'- however, it is really tight and hard to pull and vacuum at the same time and will always pull the vacuum cleaner over with a crash! It marked my wall with a huge black mark, so lay it on the floor before starting, should you buy! If you purchase to do stairs, and your staircase has landings it will rub against your railings, something to think about. My opinion is maybe still better to use a handheld vac instead, plus the vacuum does not come with a wide bare floor attachment, so it's not good for that either, oh well!"
4,Great bag.,"Top of the line materials with top of the line workmanship. Would have been 5 stars if the hooks on the front were easier to work one handed. At first I thought it was going to be too big, but now that I've started to use it I would have to say it is about perfect in size. I carry a Canon 20d with 17-55 and 70-200 lenses all the time. I have plenty of room for spare batteries, flash cards, card readers, a small water bottle, and a couple granola bars for long days in the field."
5,LOVE IT,"THEY NEVER DISAPPOINT ME, I LOVE THEIR MUSIC, IVE ALWAYS LOVED HARD ROCK AND AGAIN THIS ONE IS A WINNER"
4,And so Sevendust still lives on,"The band returns to their roots. The entire album is much more hardcore than their previous albums, and it's a bit of a refreshment. The only complaint I can make is that a few songs are forgettable (such as ""Feed"" and ""Deathstar""). But other than that, this is a very good album with lots of adrenaline from beginning to end. Lajon's vocals are, as always, wonderful and completely convincing. Connolly and Sonny Mayo give impressive performances with their guitars. Hornsby on bass and Morgan Rose on drums are victorious, though the latter's vocal parts can get quite annoying.Grade: 8.1 out of 10Also from SevendustAnimosity (10 out of 10)Seasons (7.8 out of 10)Next (8.3 out of 10)"
4,Sevendust rocks!!!,"Alpha is another great Sevendust CD! It's a little harder than the last couple of CDs, but it also has the melodic sounds that we heard from Seasons. If your a Sevendust fan, it's a must buy. Not their best, but it is still a good one with no ""album fillers""."
1,Didn't really want to give this one star,"This was an add-on item if the order was more than $25.00. My mistake for not paying closer attention to the size and assuming since two were pictured there would be two. I would return it, but shipping it back for a refund would cost more than the item cost. My intent was for my granddaughter to use it with her new kitchen set, but it appears it will need to be used for a doll's kitchen instead. Pretty disappointed and will definitely look closer at any add-ons I purchase in the future."
3,Spectrobes,This game is fun and my son loves digging up the fossils and loves the cards you can get to unlock more Spectrobes.
1,Great game concept but a little boring,"I am a 33 year old mom with three kids. Everyone in the family owns a DS, so this is a shared review!Things we like-Digging up and raising/leveling spectrobes, the way the systems are set up (easy to understand/intuitive), the graphics, the storylineThings that we don't like-battles are extremely boring/easy/repetitious, Rallen's attacks are pretty much uselessI would have preferred a battle system more like Kingdom Hearts (where everyone fights individually). I understand that it may not have been possible given the limits of a hand-held system, but it would have made it a little more interesting."
3,Teacher review,"This book is definately for older children. I teach 5th grade and it is to much for them. The facts that are included are very interesting and my kids love those. For my fifth graders i only use the creative facts throughout the book to help my students realize how big a million, billion,...and so in is. I felt the story was hard to follow. It is all in bubble - like a cartoon which was confusing to follow and not easy to read. For older students i think this book would be great. It does teach how easy it is to count using the power of 10's."
5,"Great movie, a classic","We caught this movie on TV and just had to have it! The theme, family, New York, loyalty and the Mob were familiar to us as New Yorkers. Kirk Douglas was incredible!"
2,Elderly Looking,"These shoes were cheap, i.e., inexpensive, so I kept them, but they definitely gave a more grandma vibe than that of style maven. If I had seen them inperson, I wouldn't have purchased them."
2,Not loving it,"Honestly, I bought this iron recently and don't see what the hype is about. It is heavier - whoopie! The steam doesn't make a significant difference... especially on linen! I get a work-out nearly every morning trying to work out the wrinkles on my summer clothes. I'm actually online looking to see if there's something different (READ: better) than this iron while I still have time to return it. Definitely NOT worth what I paid. The other bad thing about it is that even though it has an automatic off-switch, you can't really tell its off unless you touch it (the lights are still on and there are no sounds announcing its off, like the Black & Decker). Sorry, I don't want to have to risk touching a hot iron to make sure it turned off!"
4,Best Final Fantasy main series game I've played.,"I've been playing the Final Fantasy series in order across various consoles, GBA, PSP, DS, and now PSX. I'm about half-way through V now (PSX), meaning I've played IV (DS) since I played this one. This one is the winner. III had the best story line and game play of any of the ones I've played so far, though I really have to give props to the open-ended character stat system of the first one.If you're a fan of this type of classic RPG this is a good one to get. If it's a toss-up between III or IV get III, I liked it better, but not so much that I discourage playing the next one."
1,Big waste of time,"Not only are the characters too shallow for anyone to really care whether they succeed or not, but they also look ugly as hell. 3-D does not always mean better looking, as this game proves. The characters are all turned into Precious Moments creatures and the monsters are all babyfied. So not only does it look bad on the outside, but it's also got a pretty useless inside to match."
2,Canon needs to re-ingineer this cord,"As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it. I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera. These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them. Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months."
2,Buy a lot of 'em if you have to use them...,"Let's face it... if you're shooting with a bracket, you need this device. The problem is it's not well made. I'm on my third in a year's time. The hotshoe that hold the flash has a nasty habit of breaking at the base, making it tough to keep the thing on the bracket. That means my 580EX has had a couple of tumbles, which not only puts your equipment in a bad way, it makes you look unprofessional on the job. It was a relief to switch to using Gary Fong lightspheres and ditch the brackets altogether."
3,I Agree,"I agree with everyone here regarding the need to have this Off Camera Shoe Cord, and the regret that Canon won't improve it so that it lasts longer than a couple jobs. I also appreciate the suggestion to purchase the metal foot, but I just need to point out that I haven't been able to get the screw tight enough (the threads are just plastic) to keep the flash from rotating. I end up checking and re-aligning the flash every few minutes. So, the ideal situation would be for Canon to fix their problem."
4,Pretty good,"This book is one in a series. It is not as good as some of the others in the series, such as ""Peter's Return"" and ""Adam's Promise"", but it is pretty good. I am not crazy about books where the main female character is not very feminine or a ""Girly Girl"". Just my preference."
5,"Super Senseo - better yet, make your own PODS!","We got our Senseo after having the coffee at a cafe. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but the aroma and flavor really caught me. The dark roast is our fav, but the $$ of the pods is a bit daunting. Went on line looking for a solution. There is a ""pod maker"" you can purchase, but it's cost doesn't help the cost. I finally found a site that shows you how to ""build"" your pod using cheap, white coffee filters and the pod holder that comes with the Senseo. Works great and you can find the perfect coffee that fits your taste instead of having to settle for whatever the store has in stock at the moment! Go on line and explore the alternatives. With the Senseo's great brewing method it makes it doubly delightful!"
5,A good product,We have tried 2 or 3 alternative products for our Senseo coffee maker and have found that this offers the best combination of quality and value.
2,Weak flavored coffee,"Although I love the convenience of this coffee maker, I have been very disappointed by the flavor of the decaf coffee. The coffee brews beautifully, creating an appealing frothy ""crema"" at the top. However, the coffee itself is very bland.I keep hoping that Senseo will introduce a ""bold"" decaf option. My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their ""bold"" coffee pods. In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option. It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor. It bothers me, though, that I'm paying ""twice"" for one cup of coffee.From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is. However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor."
5,Great Pen!,"Smooth, quick drying. Excellent for writing. 'm left handed so there is a lot that I look for in a pen and this pen met all of my concerns! Great Job Uni-ball!"
4,Let's hear it for quantity!,"This book doesn't win on quality but it certainly does win on quantity. You'll be at it for days going over the 2002 ideas. Unfortunately there is a lot of repitition, but I'd say there's still at least 1500 original ideas. This book didn't solve my problems but it certainly helped me think about 1500 ways to move in the right direction."
3,You Know It's Hard = Murder,"I almost bought this thinking that ""You Know It's Hard"" was a new (or previously unreleased) track, until I realized it's actually the song ""Murder"" from ""Tweekend"". I guess they came up with a new title to be politically correct (or to fool fans like myself into buying this. ;) This CD just contains 7 different remixes of the track and none of them are as good as the original."
5,how about another book,I hope nothing has happened to Virgina. this a great series. A new book would be great.
5,Bloodhounds and mystery,"This is second book I have read in the ""Bloodhound"" series and it was excellent. Lanier is a great story teller. Best feature is her ability to write smaller stories within the larger story. You are never bored. Never confused with a bunch of names to remember that only pop up once or twice. Lots of detailed information about the dogs and search and rescue - you learn a lot just while enjoying the story. Recommend highly whether you like to read ""dog"" books or just want a good, well-crafted mystery."
1,It's a waste of money,No way I can make the good footprint. The frame is coarse too. I don't like it. I didn't use it so it just wasted my money
1,Perhaps fit to build a fire with...,"This book was one of the most profoundly self-contradicting, ludicrous works it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. It is poorly written, whether viewed as fiction or fact, and here I must say that anyone who considers that it could BE fact is sadly self-delusional. It's too bad that I don't have the room here to pick the book apart logically. This reads like a very poorly written piece of cont. fantasy."
2,"Interesting concept, pathetic execution","While Patton's idea is an interesting one, his execution is severely lacking. His prose conveys the impression not of a quality author writing about Jesus, but of a neo-spiritualist looking to make a quick buck by writing about controversial material. Certainly, the image of Jesus presented is probably closer to the historical Jesus than the one depicted in the gospels, but Patton unfortunately also manages to give him a surreal, Indiana-Jones quality that simply doesn't fit. Jesus may have been a wise man, but swimming with crocodiles was probably beyond the range of his abilities. Moreover the idea that Jesus travelled to the East to study the Eastern religions, a journey which takes up a large portion of the book, is nothing original. On the whole, this may be a good book for a (somewhat) refreshing view of Jesus, but it's certainly won't pass for good writing."
5,a true classic,a great movie. two of the best horror names finaly come together. it was great all the way up unto the end. lon did a great job. i do feel that bela could have done better. but it had a great plot. and an amazing ending. i loved the wolfman. it is truley one of my favorites
3,Tyson and Holyfield pale in comparison,"This was a favorite of mine as a child. Larry Talbolt is back as the tormented werewolf, desperatley seeking a cure to his lycantropy...And Maria Ouspenskaya as the Gypsy woman may be his only hope...the film evokes great sympathy for both characters. They land up at Castle Frankenstein seeking a cure, where they find Bela Lugosi frozen in the ice cavern. His stiff performance cannot possibly compare to Karloff's portrayal, but if you dont mind a cranky ,stiff monster, then he does a passable job. There is the obligatory laboratory scene, and finally, the main event, where the 2 Universal monsters do a quick battle before the castle is destroyed. Worth catching if you are a ""Wolfman fan"" but if you love Frankenstein, stick to the Karloff films."
2,On my second one and it has problems too.,"The first one that I got installed easily and worked fine. I was able to make voice calls while riding. I had to boost the volume of my music files in order to hear my tunes. That one failed about eight months later. IMC honored the warranty and replaced it with a new unit that didn't cancel noise as well as the first one. I had to stop and turn the motor off in order to make a voice call. Also, the wires between the speakers and mic seemed to be a little shorter which determined which side the mic and the wire that came out of the helmet were to be on. I also had to unwind the the wire around the speaker magnets in order place the speakers inline with my ears. I'm having trouble with this headset after about six months. I wanted a cheaper alternative to the more pricey headsets and got the trouble I didn't pay for. I recommend that one should pay more to get more dependability."
5,Mushy Lives!,"I just pre-ordered a copy of Rawhide Season 4 Volume 1. Too bad I have to wait until June. Just last week I almost shelled out money for the complete series from a video dealer, even knowing that the quality would be poor, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I hope Paramount doesn't make me wait 3 years for Season 5, which I consider to be Rawhide's best season (heck, beggars can't be choosy). Hey Soos"
4,Solidly built and exactly what you need for the senior pet,"We had the smaller version of this product for a full year. It was good but walking on trails instead of sidewalks took its toll. This version of the pet gear stroller,Pet Gear AT3 All-Terrain Pet Stroller for cats and dogs up to 60-pounds, Blue Skyhas sturdier wheels and frame. Our 32 lb pug is quite comfortable in it. The only drawback we've found is this version does not have the side pocket for poop bags although the underneath storage is sufficient. All in all great product."
3,COULD IMPROVE DESIGN,"I had the Happy Trails stroller first. My cat really liked it but you can't do any serious walking with it because it's small with small wheels. This AT version is a step in the right direction and could merit 4 or 5 stars but the windows out of which your pet enjoys the view (half the point of the trip for your pet) are small and the net material is sturdy tho hard to see thru. Easy to assemble if you throw the directions away.(almost worthless) and basically functions well and is an attractive design. Just really need to make the windows larger and more see thru otherwise your pet may feel clostrophobic. It still is probably the best option on the market at this time so if you can get a good price, say 149.00 or less, then go for it, or else wait for improved design changes."
3,Quite Russian?,"I find this book difficult to read. The subject matter is not difficult. The way it is written doesn't make things more difficult than needed, actually I have the feeling it oversimplifies. Every concept is introduced with an example or two, three and then the concept is discussed - a little bit. The examples, give the feeling that the text of the book is quite old. Is this typical for Russian instructional books?I haven't completed the book, I will do so. This book has its merrits as a very simple introduction to TRIZ for people who do not intend to use TRIZ professionaly. I will look for an additional more technical book."
2,Surprised,"I was quite surprised when I received this order to find one (1) potato. It does look like a potato and seems to be very durable. Small enough to fit into the little play pots and pans. They look exactly as pictured. However, I very surprised and disappointed to find there was only one instead of the three that are shown. Very misleading information. I wish I had read the comments prior to ordering. I would have known to order 2 more."
4,Works great,I used this switch to allow me to switch between batteries on my Trailmanor RV trailer. It was easy to install and works as expected. Seems to have good build quality.
4,Touching Perspective,"My 8 year old son is completely enamored by all things war -- typical boy behavior at this age. When the teacher assigned a ""multi-cultural"" book for this month, I purchased ""Hiroshima"" in an attempt to show my son two sides of war -- heroism and horror. The writing in the book is lovely and touching and you can't help but become involved in the life of the little girl injured by the bomb blast, her loss and her ultimate recovery. This is a wonderful little book and one you will be glad to have your child read."
1,Lacks clinical significance,"Data provided for only one eleven-year-old subject that had been diagnosed with Separation Anxiety Disorder, without school refusal. Article is only 4 pages in length, not 11 as stated in the description."
5,"Great Price, Great Bag","After scrutinizing practically every camera bag available, I opted for this one, mostly because of the price. Turned out to be a great bag and exactly what I needed! I am currently using a Canon XH-A1 and this bag works perfectly for storage and light travel. Although I don't travel with the camera too much, I have hauled it across the country and around conventions. This bag is nice and lightweight compared to some other camera bags out there and has plenty of room for accessories, tapes, mics, etc. I love that I can rearrange the foam inside to make different compartments if necessary, too."
1,Bad Theme,"In the title I read ""The Guy's Game"". Okay, but these titles would best suit the game: ""The Straight Guy's Game"" or ""Sex Trivia"". I find this game's theme very poor. ""You Don't Know Jack"" has more class than this game... Themes for trivia games are nice, but not required, and certainly not a porno-video game (the better you play, the most skin they show). No more to say about this game's badness. Hopefully any other games, either trivia or from this company, will be more professional and fun, not just a orgy software package."
5,Oscar Robertson and the Crispus Attucks Tigers win again,"This book is the story of Crispus Attucks rise to basketball fame despite the prejudical climate in Indiana at the time. There is a history lesson in explaining what prejudice existed and how the Crispus Attucks family dealt with it. The book cronicles the high school story of Oscar Robertson in particular and the Crispus Attuck Tigers from 1950 thru Oscar's final high school game as the number one player on Indiana's all star team vs the Kentucky all star team lead by ""King Kelly Coleman"". I was an Indianapolis high school resident during this period and can speak for the historical accuracy and emotional insights brought into focus by the author Randy Roberts. For those of you who enjoy basketball, this book is a worth while purchase."
4,A lot of fun,"I enjoyed this book so much that I could hardly put it down. The main character in this book, Viola, is a young woman without a very thorough education but a good heart and good instincts about how to be a friend to others. She learns to cook, makes costly mistakes, and becomes friends with some incredible characters. It is mostly a funny, romantic book but it touches on a few serious issues. It made me think some and laugh a lot! This book is definitely worth your time especially if you enjoy cooking, art, or the ""romance"" of the English countryside!"
3,Sanding belt review,Product delivered as described. The grit on the sandpaper doesn't last as long as it should. The adhesive where the belt ends join together is very poor and the belt end seam comes apart too easily.
3,Basic and not so fabulous,"Unfortunately, the patterns make boxy garments without much shaping. While errors, as noted by an earlier reviewer, are problems, omissions make the book deficient, and a novice would have difficulty. The book offers interesting ideas, but I found making adjustments to the instructions was the only way to get good results."
3,"Maestro, Greenspan's ""Biography""","This book was basically a miniature biography on the life of Alan Greenspan. Except this book does not really go into Greenspan's personal life, the only feature of this book that is not included about Alan Greenspan is his personal life. Although once or twice Greenspan's girlfriend, Andrea Mitchel was mentioned. For the most part this entire book solely focusses on Greenspan's work as an economist for the United States government. In my personal opinion Bob Woodward basically just stated facts and had no criticism whatsoever throughout this entire book this is the only part that bugged me. Woodward basically just wrote straight facts and tried a little too hard to make Greenspan look incredibly good in the end."
3,Greenspan Primer,"This book has taken a lot of heat for, among other things, Greenspan worship, bad economics, and more.Concededly, you won't get a deep understanding of what the Fed is or does from this book. If want a good intro to the Fed and it's role as chief manipulator of our monetary plumbing, then I would suggest ""Secrets of the Temple"" by William Greider.On the other hand, if you're curious about the politics within and without the Fed, then this book is a good source. Though written when Clinton was still President, you can get a feel of what kind of internal debates must be raging right now as the equity markets head into the tank and people clamor for further rate cuts.Although Greenspan's tenure could be characterized by an ""American Boom"", this book reminds us that it began with the 1987 crash and was punctuated by the Mexico crisis in '94, LTCM in '98. Greenspan deserves a lot of credit, but I have to ask the question: Where have you gone Bob Rubin?"
5,An Economists Must,"Greenspan's greatest asset as chairman of the FED, is his ability to keep his cards close to his chest and not play the political game, or does he play it so well that he fools the fools? This book does a great job at looking under the hood of Greenspan.Maestro goes into great chronological detail of all major FOMC meetings and significant events. Woodward gets somewhat technical into FOMC operations and policy. IF you've ever studied macroeconomics, specifically monetary discretion and operations this book will put those concepts into action."
3,Blah...,"I expected two things from this book, and got neither of them. I wanted to see some crisp explanation of the complicated economic conditions driving Mr. Greenspan's thinking (""Being Greenspan for Dummies""). If I didn't get that, then I wanted Maestro to be more biographical (""Who is Greenspan, and why does he operate the way he does""). Instead the reader is presented with 200+ pages dull historical narrative that reads something like ""Greenspan thought the economy was getting too hot so he argued for 1/2% increase. He won and the rates were raised with an asymetric directive toward further rate hikes. Then he realized he'd put the brakes on too hard so he argued for a 1/4% decrease."" This book is clearly not worth your time or money."
4,great product,"This is a great product for a great price, the only thing that I did not like is that the size is not very accurate, so you have to calculate to buy 1 number less than your regular size, but other than that is a great pair of shoes!"
5,It is what it says,67mm lens cap replacement. Works will lenses like the 18-135mm or the 70-300mm VR. Not sure what size is your lens? Look at the rear of the lens near where the end cap will go. You'll see a bunch of letterings and numbers. The last number is your filter size.
5,This video has almost every song including Step to Me,If You Can't Dance Who Do You Think You Are? Something Kinda Funny Saturday Night Divas Say You'll Be There Step to Me Naked 2 Become 1 Stop Too Much Spice Up Your Life Love Thing Mama Move Over Wannabe
3,Not so good...,"This product is not very good. I like the 2 built-in USB connections. However, the transmitter itself is not good, as far as my experience goes. Use Belkin Portable Music TuneCast II FM Transmitter (F8V3080) instead. It is the best in my experience (ASIN: B0001F22PA)."
1,one star is too kind,"I'd never read any BTB, so decided to give this one a try. Although I scanned through this quite a while ago, I am taking the time to tender these comments, so that others may save their time and money. This book is a perfect example of terrible writing, an improbable plot, two dimensional characters - there is nothing to recommend this piece of fluff. Do all BTB's books have this fairy tale quality? It's a good time killer if you're stuck in an elevator and bored out of your mind...but otherwise, forget it."
3,did the author get stuck?,"Although I have only read a few of Ms. Bradfords books, I cant say I was overwhelmed with this book. It seems to me she wrote herself into a corner,and instead of thinking it threw well she went into the supernatural to get threw the book. I liked the story line, but thought the story as a whole wasnt very well thought out."
1,Kit too small,"I bought this item to install my Prestige P-153B radio in my 92 Honda Accord. The kit, ALL of it, is too small to fit my system. The ambiguous instructions are too generic to know what else to do with the kit. It simply doesn't work for me."
2,unlady like pursuits,Too many details. Good story line but it was a little hard to read through it. A little long as well.
4,DO!!!!!!!!!,"Very promising new writer. I hope to see more from. Very fun regency, with a sexy hero! A lot of promise. I enjoyed it. Found it worth my time and money."
4,great read,"ln the beginning of the book Emily is getting old, she wants to hit 25 so she can be dropped out of the marriage mart. No such luck. Her conniving stepmother has convinced her father to marry her off to the stepmother's ICKY nephew. Emily also likes adventure which she finds with a handsome stranger....needless to say, by the end of the book Emily is off the marriage mart and definitely not a spinster. Lots of adventure, romance, sarcasm and witty repartee in between."
1,AVOID,"I bought this after hearing all the fanfare, and reading mixed reviews on amazon. It's obvious some people who reviewed this were letting their devotion for Iggy get in the way of giving an intelligent and realistic verdict. The CDs sound awful, to put it bluntly. On the first disc one can barely hear the guitar, and on the second it sounds like the show was recorded by a microphone that was under a wet blanket. It's interesting as a document of how out of control Iggy's shows got, but it's worth one listen, if that. It seems like Iggy has this huge mystique surrounding him that causes every piece of crap recording out there to get released. The liner notes said he wasn't even making money off this one, that's a good indication of market flooding. If listening to good punk music involves listening to garbage like this, I want nothing to do with it. This isn't the real truth or the best example of Iggy Pop live. It's just pushing garbage disguised as gold."
2,Way too large,"Like the finish and heft of the metal, but the hook is way too large for what I intended--a hand towel. A lot of empty space between lower edge and upper. Be sure to check dimensions before ordering to be sure it will meet your needs. I didn't and now I am returning it."
5,What a Positive and Inspirational Guide!,"I read this book cover to cover. Even though a lot of it is common sense, having it all in one handy book is insightful. Each tip is short and succinct, never more than a single page, and captures the point with maybe one anecdote. Even though I probably committed half of all the mistakes pointed out in the book, I still forged through to the end. Convinced now that my boss hates me (not really), I'm going to go back over my flaws and improve myself. After all, this is what the book is about, maintaining a positive attitude and doing the best you can."
3,Looks cool in the picture,"This wine rack looks cool in the photo, but when you receive it - it is actually quite large. It does make a good centerpiece for a party."
4,raw/old skool w/ hard lyrics,"sounds like a good cd i would want to buy, since i sampled it on iTunes. if you want the disc, do yourself a favor, buy it from iTunes. they're selling it for $7.99these ppl selling it up here for $110 are crazy.and if you are looking for other hard to find artists, like Rhyme Poetic Mafia for example, iTunes also sells their stuff. i know a seller on amazon is selling their cassette tape for like $95.00 yeah, they're rare, but $95.00 cmon..all you ppl who want the hard to find artists, if amazon doesn't have them or ebay, or the price ain't right, go to iTunes."
4,Great live album,"After the death of Davy Jones, I started to listen to some old Monkees tunes. They actually have a lot of good music and even perform better. I watched their best live performance on Youtube and was pleasantly surprised to see that this CD is a recording of that album."
2,Well Heck! I already read this before,"I read ""A Bullet for Cindarella"" and didn't realise that ""On The Make"" wasthe same story again...Maybe I'll re-read it next year."
3,Good review book for marketing practitioners,"Kotler's new book lives up to his reputation and the quality of his previous titles. Chapters 8 & 9 are particularly interesting, especially his responses to FAQs in his seminars. Reading the book however feels like sitting through his three-day seminar compressed into one hour. The book might have been better written had it provided more details. Unlike his earlier works, he does not have too many breakthrough ideas nor research support. Still, for any marketing practitioner who wants a refresher course, the book is easy to read."
4,five ancestors tiger,"Five AncestorsTiger7 monks go on a death taking adventure. My opinion is the best book ever. Tiger is about these 5 young monks that survived a Cangzhen Temple explosion. They each named a fighting style tiger,monkey, snake, eagle, dragon. They are each masters of a fighting styles. The martial arts come from the masters of the 5 monks. The five scatter and begin teaching not only their peaceful philosophy of life. It has a Cliff hanger at the end of the book.He has great details. Every time he puts a detail in he explains it. He explains whats happing in the story. When he tells about the story he gives details.Fu saves the tigers from destruction. He saved the tigers because he is a tiger in his fighting style. In kung Fu, Ying killed Grandmaster. Whatever they are there the master of there fighting style.Ying is an eagle in his fighting style. Fu is a tiger in his fighting style. Malao is a monkey.ReadTiger"
5,Good Book,I learned so much from theis book. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and David Kessler did a fine job.
3,"Great Points, Even If Derivable From Classics","Just makes me feel so good to read this. Gives perspective on everything that matters in life. Love first and foremost: Being present, fully present to my wife, and to family and friends. Partly because of Loss: You will always cherish those moments above all. But also Surrender: to the fact that there will be things that happen during the day that you can not control. Good lessons, though also attainable from classics. Grade: B-."
4,&#65533;Life Lessons&#65533; is Worth to Read,"The book ""Life Lesson"" was written by Ross and David is one of my favorite books. It teaches us about the mysteries of life and living, so it is a very valuable book. The content of this book is very wide. It includes fourteen of life lessons such as the lesson of love, the lesson of anger, the lesson of forgive and so on. Because the author describes each lesson with vivid example and clear language, this book is easy to be read and understand. I already read this book twice, but I still want to read it again in order to each life lesson is very important for me. I think this book is worth everybody to read. I recommend this book to other people for three reasons: the events in the book are interesting and realistic, the author's point of view is brief and easy to understand and the lessons in the book can instruct us how to handle the issues that we are experiencing"
5,I AM GOING TO GIVE THIS TO EVERYONE I KNOW AND LOVE,"While both these people are know for their work with death and dying, THIS BOOK IS ABOUT LIFE, LIVING AND LIVING WELL..... I used Mr. Kessler's book ""THE NEEDS OF THE DYING"" as my bible (if you will) while my father was transitioning and I dont think I would have done as well without it. This book has and will continue to aid me with my life, as well as those around me and I believe it will help me to live it more fully and with more appreciation...also to be more aware and conscious. I think if there is anyone whose life you wish to improve, this is the book to do it!"
3,Great except fpr too much dialogue,"I thought the CD was great except for all the Dialogue... I thought that it would have made a better CD if they cut out all the chatter and just sang the songs... At some points it sounds like they play down to kids to keep them interested... I would like to see more albums done with the music then with the chatter... Other then that, it should have been better"
2,The beginning of the end,"The second book in the Posleen War series, Gust Front is where it starts being bad. One of the problems is that when envisioning an alien invasion of Earth, it seems that John Ringo had to think of a way where Earthlings can actually fight back. It just seems somewhat unbelievable to me, although he's developed a whole subplot involving the evoloution (or Uplift) of the various alien species. Either way, Ringo seems to go out of his way to say that humans (and by extension, Americans) are superior to everybody else, even spacefaring aliens. The book is not as interesting as the first book, but he continues with his political commentary. It got a little too tiresome for me, yet I still finished the book."
3,A vast improvement,"In this second book, Ringo created a very tense environment. I was eager to about the first invasion force, and the psychological impact on the world. I enjoyed much of the battle sequences. These were all good things.There are still some story threads presented in the first book that are either explored sparingly or not at all. This is unfortunate; I really wanted to get more of an insight into the backroom dealings that will have some impact later in the series.I think there are still some rough edges in his writing, and places for improvement. But this book does create the desire to continue reading and to learn about the fate of our heroes."
4,This is a nice piece.,"This time piece is elegant and stylish a lot of my friends and co workers like it. The only down size is that it relays on light to operate. Thus, turning off when store for a few days."
3,Name of a song,Does anybody know the name of the song when Napoleon is riding with Pedro's cousins while going to the dance?
4,pretty cool tunes,"Its unfortunate that they left out one of the best songs in the movie, the infamous dance scene song. For all of those that are struggling trying to find out what song that was, it was Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat"" off of their synkronized album."
1,Please read this before you buy!,"This sound track is an absolute disappointment. Where is the zero star option? The movie is fantastic, probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. The sound track was clearly an afterthought. It is missing way too many songs. Mr. Travis J. Parry has identified most of the missing songs in his review. Another annoying feature of the sondtrack is the inclusion of songs that are not in the film. The final problem is that the dialogue from the movie is such poor quality that you can barely hear it. I wouldn't have bought the soundtrack had I had this information before. PS. the soundtrack has Kip's song at the end of track 42, ""The Promise"", it's roughly one minute after the end of the song. Patience Grasshopper."
1,"Better when she was called ""Miami Sound Machine""","This CD reconfirms Epic's commitment to making Gloria Estefan a manufactured superstar. A limited talent at best, she started off as the singer in Miami Sound Machine, where she should have stayed. Earlier MSM hits like the bubbly ""Bad Boy"" and ""Falling in Love"" are ignored here, but for some reason they chose to include the MSM hits ""Conga"" (never could stomach that one) and the listenable ""Words get in the Way"". That track is the only good one on this CD. Once she became Miss Cuban hootchie-cootchie mama, quality was thrown aside for utter banality. But everybody loves a superstar, right? Even if mediocrity ""gets in the way"". Unbelievably, MSM made a return without her on the soundtrack to the forgettable Sylvester Stallone film ""The Specialist"", with the tribal-sounding dance chart hit ""Jambala"", which turned out to be better than anything recorded with Estefan. Hunt that one down, and forget this."
2,Not Appropriate for Middle School,"This product led me to believe it was appropriate for grades K-8, unfortunatley this is not so. I am a middle school teacher and found this book only to be appropriate for grades K-5, but it focuses on the primary grades. If you teach above fourth grade, don't buy it."
1,poor quality-like a poor home movie with bad editing,"I found out late the same as the first reviewer found. This DVD was poor quality and the areas the DVD said it would feature was not a feature. Mr. Hunt said it was a train trip journey but I expected more of a travel video, not just touching upon each area way too briefly. I wish Amazon could inform the potential buyer that it is not a commercial, high quality product."
5,Endless classic!,"I first watched this movie when I was about ten years old and it just stayed with me! It took me years to get it in DVD. Indeed a great movie, definitely a must see!"
4,"""The"" book for sailing the Greek waters.","If you'e going, get this book. If you've been there hopefully it was already aboard with you. Great reference book: It is the book to have as a sailor in that area. Greek mapping of ATONs etc is not the best and this publication contains the best local knowledge you could have aboard unless your skipper is a highly knowledgeable local sailor. Landmarks, harbor services, native's demeanor, food & supplies, light historical info, phone numbers, even a glossary of useful Greek terms. This was my second trip using this book."
3,Good basic introduction to early photography,I purchased this book because I'm a Civil War enthusiast and have several vintage images. The book provided me with all the information I was hoping to obtain.
5,hard to put down,This book was the American version of the German Guy Sajers Forgotten Solider.this book was a day to day account of war and its effects on the soldiers who fight it.
2,Keep Losing Balls!,"While I know this isn't really the manufacturer's fault, my son can never enjoy this toy because 1 or more of the balls is always lost (and the toy doesn't work without all of the balls). It might be fun if we consistently had all the balls but in our house we just can't seem to keep them all in one spot."
4,Works great!,"This is my second one because the springy tab that locks the holder into the handlebar slot cracked. Luckily it didn't let the GPS bounce out and onto the road! Easy to mount, one screw to bind it to the handlebar. So easy a yeah right. LOL Too bad Garmin won't let you update your maps anymore on the Quest and Quest II. If I was rating them I would give them a ZERO for forcing people to replace their GPS. When my Quest dies I'll use my cellphone navigation app."
3,reason for my rateing,"it,s not what i expected, its one of those things that i didn't need to have it, but wanted it . i don't know why but never the less its ok."
1,You are on your own,"I purchased this watch for my wife in September 2011. It was shipped by Perfect Timing, an Amazon.com supplier. In March 2012, the back panel of the watch detached itself from the watch and the watch stopped working. We filed a report to Perfect Timing, asking them to repair the watch under the 30 months warranty that was provided with the watch. We received from Perfect Timing rejecting the claim and wording of their one line response was rude. We are still trying to solve the problem with Amazon. com, but so far they have not been very helpful.So, beware when you purchase an expensive product from Amazon.com if the shipment is done by an outside supplier.Unless you are talented in the repair of watched, my advice would be to stay away from Perfect Timing,"
1,One sided and closed mined,"America, stop reading this trash. This book is one of the reasons why America is screwed up. Go look for a book that takes an honest and objective look at the issues then you go and decide for yourself who is screwing up America. If you read this book than you are only part of the problem too."
1,A waste of good paper.,"This is an absurd book, like many from the right, withoutany merit whatsoever. The author wrote this thing for money, and for those who think about money and the possible loss of it 7/24. The people he bashes (for the most part) critique the already-existing dictatorship of Bush. and the empire building the ""new"" Republican Party is engaged in in Iraq and elsewhere. Like everyhting with a Fox News tinge, this is an embarassment to people of intelligence. But this is the discourse, folks..the day of the locust."
1,This Book Is Fox News Worthy,"HarperCollins, who published this book, is a division of News Corp., which owns Fox News. Now think about what's happening here. Someone like Goldberg writes a smear book that dovetails with the smearing and propagandizing already being done by the radical right, Fox being one of its most prominent voices. Rupert Murdoch publishes the book. A web page is set up on the publisher's site to smear from there, and the author goes on a publicity tour which includes many appearances on Murdoch's Fox News. During the author's appearance(s), Fox shows the book's cover and generally promotes the book, but the audience is never told about the author's connection to Fox and News Corp. The book is partisan hatred, period. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Goldberg should be on this list,"I object to a book that proports to be defending conservative values in America using the term ""screwing up"" in its title. This debases everything that Mr. Goldberg claims to stand for. Why couldn't he use another word -- Undermining? Threatening? Destroying? How can you believe an author such as this when he displays such bad taste and bad judgment in naming his book? Shame on you!"
1,Mindless Drivel,"While I agree with many of the choices in this book, many deserving stars of the American elite were left out. For example, where are George W. Bush and Rush Limbaugh. They do more to hurt this country than most of the elitists in the book."
3,Blaaahhh!,"This book had some interesting points & as Goldberg points out, it is his opinion! After a few chapters it became tiresome--just more blah, blah blah! Beware you will receive all sorts of conservative & anti-liberal offers in your Goldbox if you purchase this book!"
1,Biased and Arrogant,"Another case of the pot calling the kettle...It is a mistake to review this book as if it were serious. A serious look at defining the trouble in America would include the corporate manhadlers, some lobbyisyts, and at least one conservative political name on the list. Instead, it is a list of those people conservatives love to hate. So let's forget the politics and take a look at the amusement value and prose. Both sorely lacking because he takes himself far too seriously and lacks the writing skill to at least bring the book to a pleasant amusing read. If you want to read summer trash then stick with the Danielle Steele novels at least they are honest at what they proport to be."
1,Typical right-wing propaganda,"As is typical of books of this genra from the right of center, there is no documentation. I'd like to verify some of Goldberg's claims but it isn't easy. This makes me suspect him of sour grapes. Hardly a book worth spending much time on."
1,Bernard Goldebeg is a Big Fat Idiot,Bernard Goldberg's views are so right wing it makes my computer screen tilt
1,Bitter Disillusionment,"Mr. Goldberg appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and sparred with Jon, who sought unsuccessfully to find the origins of Goldberg's bitterness. In reading his book, Goldberg comes across vitriolic and misinformed with a relish for smearing icons of society, primarly left-leaning politicians. It is not an easy read. Jon Stewart gave him the best one might hope to hear about such a baselessly negative book."
1,Nonsense List,"A book of the 100 (now 110) people who are screwing up America should have Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly and Coulter on the cover... yet they don't even make the list?More of the usual Bush administration/GOP propaganda... and, as with all the other (Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly) books, it reads as if it were written to be read by a 4th grader."
1,And Bernard Goldberg should be at the top of the list,"This is the type of right wing, arch conservative garbage which is really screwing up the country. It seems that any one who is a lout and a blowhard can write a book and get it in the best seller's list. Maybe Mr. Goldberg should take a stab at really trying to improve this country rather that another neo-journalist accentuating the negatives.Don't waste your hard earned money on this trash, donate it to a worthwhile organization instead."
1,Another Book from Another bitter Conservative,"Just another long line of books blaming all the ills of the world on ""Liberals"". As if we don't have enough polorization in this country, books like this just feed into it and the authors keep making money off some Americans misguided dream of an ideal society that never really existed and never will."
1,An unfortunate bore,"To be fair I only read half the book. I just could not justify the time to finish it. While a few people and angle are well thought out most of it was just boring rambling. It seems to get a spot in the book all one needs to do is to speak badly about President Bush or the war on Iraq and that will cover over half the people ""featured"" in the book. And to think I considered myself a conservative before I read this book."
1,thanks - i saved $17!!,"more ill-conceived, poorly thought out conservative drivel. there is a very conservative co-worker with whom i have a very friendly professional relationship - from the get go, we agreed to disagree. as a result, we have some very stimulating, feisty and downright pleasant, political discussions. i borrowed this book from her before goldberg was on the daily show (where, in a performance that was vintage jon stewart, he graciously and brilliantly skewered the author). his appearance did nothing to alter my thoughts on this book. barbara streisand? certainly there are more insidious challenges facing the nation than an aging pop singer.too bad i couldn't give it 0 stars."
1,"Hey kettle, ya know what color you are?","Amazing. To the proponents of this book: list for me some of the salient points that Goldberg used to justify saying that Al Franken is ""screwing up America"".For those who haven't read it yet, the ""chapter"" on Franken consistes of a self-serving, imaginary interview between Goldberg and Franken wherein Franken ""admits"" that he is so mean because he hates himself.Yes, this is strong stuff.Sadly, his side keeps winning with this claptrap.It reminds me of Lovitz-as-Dukakis in the SNL send-up of the '88 presidential debate:""I can't believe I'm losing to this guy!""There is a good amount of dead-on ridicule of loony PC extremists, but how tough is that these days? Most of us on the left do that on a regular basis as well.If you are a partisan on the right looking for unchallenging affirmation of your cultural views, by all means buy this book.For anyone wanting social commentary with a bit more insight, keep looking."
2,"Love it or hate - don't buy it, just read it at the store.","OK, I'm a liberal, but I was still interested in what Goldberg had to say in this book, so I picked it up in the bookstore and was amazed to see that there's just isn't much there there. It took me about 30 minutes and a cup of coffee to breeze my way through most of it -- there is just nothing here but a few paragraphs of sniping on each of a cast of activist liberals, with a few hollywood types and token deranged conservatives thrown in (the latter just to make the point that while all lefties are extremists, only a few on the right are and Goldberg is happy to offer them up). I'll admit some of it was marginally fun to read, but it has all the intellectual depth of an Archie comic. I'm not saying ""don't read it"" -- I'm just saying you don't need to buy it --- you can read it standing up in your local bookstore in the time it takes to finish that tall mocha latte."
2,www.sportofdistraction.com,"The idea that Bernard Goldberg would be able to identify those hurting America, while focusing on politicians of a certain ideology seems dishonest and unintelligible. Goldberg is amongst those who actually believes that there is a liberal media bias, so from that point of reference, how can any analysis he provides be viewed with any credibility?[...]To have AlFranken on your list is not necessarily wrong as long as you include the yang to his yin in the form of Limbaugh, Hannity, and O'Reilly. That's basic & logical to anyone that actually is interested in dissecting this atmosphere under which we operate. Who in their right minds thinks that the conservative counterparts to all of the liberal political figures in this book is not just as, if not more (in certain situations), egregious in their intentions?"
1,The difference....,"The big thing I noticed between this book and Al Franken's Lying Liars book is that Franken actually did research and backed up his assertions. I don't really remember many people successfully disputing many (or any) of the points in his book. Fox News' biggest issue with it was the use of the phrase ""Fair and Balanced""Goldberg just seems to be giving his opinion about liberals he doesn't like. He's completely entitled to his opinion, but he doesn't even really clarify how a lot of these people are screwing up America (e.g. Courtney Love: HO). I'm not sure how that's helpful to any reader.I guess if you're an angry conservative and this makes you feel good...go ahead and buy it. But if you're looking for something to help you better understand the current state of the country I'd recommend passing on it. Read something by David McCullough instead...or Freakonomics - that is a cool book!"
3,"Nothing special, but has some amusement value","I basically agree with the review by ""Nails in My Head"" below. Three stars; the book is standard fare for its genre and nothing special. I was somewhat put off by the spittle-flecked rant by ""Mr J.A.Davis"" that masquerades as a customer review here. Jeez, this stuff is hate speech. The guy obviously hasn't read the book, yet has taken the time to try to tag it like an angry teenager with a can of spray paint. He needs to understand that in a tolerant, multicultural society all points of view are welcome, not just those he agrees with."
5,Excellent Transaction - Great Book!!!,Book arrived in perfect condition in a very short amount of time.... It arrived in perfect condition. BTW - it is an incredible list and book!
4,Bold Writing,"The book was a very light read sprinkled with a great deal of humor and some sarcasm as the author expressed some very strong opinions. His list contains many household names including senators, newsmen and Hollywood types. For the most part he did a good job of expressing his reasoning for inclusion of each person, whether conservative or liberal, as one ""screwing up America."" He also introduced us to some lesser-known people with explanation for their presence on the list."
2,Hard Cover People Magazine Fluff,"A few things written here are on the money, however, most of it is whiney I-get-to-say-something-nasty-about-someone-I-don't-like-and-they-can't-say-anything-back snipes which I've read/heard a dozen times at least (much like most of these kind of books left, right, middle and middle earth). This adolescent quibbling is getting old people. Stop it. You are better than this (I hope).As I read, I often said to myself ""I can't believe intelligent adults get away with writing this fluff in hard cover."" My main complaint is, many of the people profiled are condemned for speaking out about what they believe and it's okay as long as they say what the author wants to hear. Freedom of speech simply does not work that way. Thank goodness.Want to do something good for America? Use the time it takes to read books like this one and read to a child, an elder, or a any of the many people in your community who would enjoy your company and a good story. I sure wish I did."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I'd recommend ""The Republican Noise Machine : Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy"".""100 People"" is a distraction. America has some real issues. Actors saying unpatriotic thing abroad and ""potty mouth"" rap singers are not among them.A real issue might be how the Federal Gov't can't meet it's long term financial obligations. Try reading ""Running On Empty: How The Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It"". Watch out though. It does contain compound sentences."
1,Another Liberal Bashing Monologue. Waste of Time,This is another self serving material for the right wing. Goldberg criticizes people on the left for hyprocrisy but fails to recognize similar hypocrisy in his own work and in the work of his favorite people on the right. Goldberg talks about people on the left always complaining. But look at the title of this book. Why not write about 100 people who are making America great.
1,Very stupid,"What a waste of paper. I don't care if Al Franken is on the list or not, but where are Dick ""draft dodger"" Cheney and the Traitor Karl Rove (who is also a draft dodger). Surely these two deserve to be on the list."
1,Lame At Best!,"An Elitist List written by someone who in my opinion is far from balanced, who has appeared on Fox News 8 times in the last 20 days promoting this, and not appearing on any other major network due to lack of invitation???I rest my case.Poor Al! Cover material."
1,Mid-America,"Education doesn't equate to intelligence, as the author of this book proves. The legacy of the Rove-led right will be at least 2 supreme court nominees who will ultimately disassemble the civil rights that the left spent the past 70 years fighting for. Thank God for the people the author lambastes, who at least remind us just how stupid and gullible his ilk can be. The London Daily Mirror said it best ('How can 54,000,000 people be so DUMB?')"
1,"Biased and arrogant, a waste of time","This book lists ""100 people who are screweing up America"". But the selection of the author is so biased, so devoid of people who are REALLY screwing up this country (President Bush, Dick Cheney come to mind) that reading it, is really a waste of time. All you get is rightist propaganda of the worst kind with no effort of a balanced view of the big picture. This country is being driven into wars we do not want and do not need, driven into an energy dependence that will soon choke our economy and nothing is being done to counter it. THOSE are the people who are screwing up America, but they do not appear in the list.Spare your time and money!"
4,Jack,"I wish more people in the media had the courage to speak out about the ""beautiful people"" who are making a mockery of what is right and wrong in our great nation. I may not agree with all the 100 people he selected, he right on 95% of the PC people."
1,Superficial,"One can dicker all day as to why Michael Moore & Al Franken are included on the list, but Rush Limbaugh et al are omitted. Is that really the point? Neither Rush nor Al Franken influences my opinions particularly, nor are they pushing laws through the state legislature or US Congress that are having a direct impact on my day-to-day life. They are simply commentators, or celebrities with opinions, like Barbra Streisand. Everybody on this list is very high profile, but only a small percentage could truly be considered people of importance --- people who truly do influence the direction this country takes. The top 100 people --- for better or worse --- are probably individuals of whom you have never heard or read a word.Goldberg could have probed into the deeper questions as to who moves & shakes the country, but he opted for the easier route of taking cheap shots at high-profile lightweights who don't share his political views. Books don't get much more useless or ephemeral than this."
1,Omissions,"I'm sure you're all desperate for Amazon to add ""0 stars"" as an option. So am I - once I refused the indignity and did not review Civilization III.Anyway,BushJerry FalwellDick CheneyOsama bin LadenRush LimbaughDonald RumsfeldCongressJack ValentiShaquille O'Neal (""oh i don't care if i curse, i don't wanna be no role model"")Actually, I am OVER 13, but had to say I am a kid because I don't yet have an e-mail address. If I did, you might have been able to nominate others - this book is SO bad, I'm compiling my own list. The people who I just listed are currently at the top."
1,Trash,"What Goldberg means is that liberals are ruining America. This is the kind of childish rhetoric that goes on in the country. Watching Goldberg on tv complained how people are rude by uttering the f-bomb on the streets. I guess he didnt hear Cheney's f-bomb on the senate floor. Goldberg says there are conservatives in the book, but by the cover, you wouldnt know it. Goldberg calls Rush a ""civil guy,"" that's one redflag of his bias."
1,TOTAL TRASH!,THIS IS TRASH TO THE 100TH DEGREE!NO TREE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN TO MAKE THIS!I THINK THE # 1 PERSON SHOULD BE THE AUTHOR!COME ON - JIMMY CARTER AT #4??!! (A MAN FULL OF PEACE)I AM SURPRISED THE AUTHOR DIDN'T PUT GOD ON THE LIST!!!THIS AUTHOR IS A CRACKPOT!!!DISGUSTING!!!
2,Just right wing ranting,"Mr. Goldberg's ""Top 100"" is simply a list of who political conservatives hate. This is red meat to the faithful. He'll no doubt sell a lot of books."
2,MIldly amusing if nothing else,"And this book is pretty much nothing else, except for a way for Goldberg to liberal-bash. Is all of what he says lies? No, of course not. Is the spin he puts on it dishonest. Absolutely. But in order to see this, one has to read this book with a completely open mind.As far as his accusing certain people of being imbeciles who are wrecking the country, he's simply stupid. Anyone with a brain knows there's only one imbecile wrecking this country. And he's not in Hollywood, Boston, New York, MIchigan, or any other state or district except two. DC and TX? Good guess."
4,An eye opener,"THis was not exactly what I had envisioned it to be , however it really makes you think. The impact some of these people have on Americans is enough to cause a lot of concern. I highly recommend others to read and consider the influence these peole have on our gullible society."
5,Bell'd Again!,"This CD is sheer, intense soul for the violin. Each selection is perfect. A must have if you enjoy Joshua Bell."
4,Voice of the Violin,"This album, as all of Joshua Bell's albums, is beautiful. While it had several new favorites, not everything would fall into that category. Romance of the Violin appealed to me more."
5,Magical,"Along with Romance of the Violin, this is the most beautiful collection of violin I have heard. In the car or in the home, just put it in the player and enjoy."
2,avoid this book,"This book is a good idea -- it's very handy to combine dictionary/verb tenses/pronunciation guide/phrasebook in a small book. But I ended up finding multiple small errors in it, mistranslations and omissions. Sure, it gets most things right, but a beginners guide to a common language should get *everything* right. Errors make things ten times more confusing."
1,Don't buy this,This is not a proper Dictionary. It only defines words from Portuguese to English and is in no sense adequate enough to help you learn the language. I would highly suggest putting your money into any other dictionary but this. I feel this is the kind of dictionary people buy to waste their money and are not interested in learning language. The layout is difficult to follow and as whole the book is a joke. I had to borrow this dictionary from a friend while I travelled in Brazil and had to give it back because it was better to go without it than to carry something around that was a waste of space!
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is just an advanced version of a travel phrase book. It does not give you the pronunciation guides, or how the words would be used in a phrase. I was very disappointed with this book."
2,"Expect better of such an expensive ""OEM"" item","This is supposedly the same item that Olympus sells directly for use with their cameras (I'm using it with the EP1). As other's mentioned, it is very difficult to get the PC sync cable into the port. The post is too large, and you can feel that it is bending the guides in the cable. Because I am using this exclusively in the studio and can leave my cable plugged into this item, it's not a huge deal. At the same time, for such an expensive and ""OEM"" solution, it's inexcusable. If I felt like bothering with it, I would definitely send this back and look at cheaper versions that may work just as well without the design issues.I purchased it despite other's pointing out this flaw specifically because I was in a hurry to test my camera out with a strobe setup, and didn't want to have to deal with cheaper versions that didn't work electronically."
3,Just OK,"This was my first read of Compton and given the reviews and comparisons to L'Amour, I was interested to find a new Western author with a character series like Nathan Stone. While the book is not a bad read, I found it disappointing. There is no real story line here, but a collection of short stories as Nathan Stone travels through the west. I've only read this one book, but comparisons to L'Amour are not justifiable in my opinion. My search for another Western author continues."
2,Entertaining but sparse,"""Crows"" is a short collection of unorganized and disorganized anecdotes. There is little text on each page, and the book is short. Brief stories from myth and legend are interspersed with the text as two page inserts that irritatingly look like the rest of the text. Whenever these myths and legends are inserted, the reader is confused when the previous pages' text don't just continue on the next page.Crows are great, kindred spirits that have gotten an undeserved bad rap. This book, while entertaining, is mostly fluff and little substance. It is just the merest taste of the intelligence and personality of these birds. For learning about crows, ravens, and ourselves at a deeper level I recommend ""Mind of the Raven"" by Bernd Heinrich, ""Bird Brains"" by Candace Savage (same author), and ""Caw of the Wild"" by Barb Kirpluk (what a name for a bird enthusiast!)."
2,Fluff & myths..,"From the description I believed I'd get some useful information,not fluff and myths.Better books are available if you want to learn something about corvids.And there's always Aesop's Fables..."
5,Workhorse guide to fly fishing Colorado. My 'go to' book.,"I don't have this current version. I have a prior version. It is worn and tattered because it goes everywhere. Nice balance between being an encyclopedia and a fly fisher's river guide. I buy specialized references for some rivers but I still carry this one. Includes river and reservoir narratives, hatch charts, flies to use, nearby ammenities, lodging, campgrounds, maps, etc. Just FYI, my older version doesn't get to the level of labeling the fishing holes. Even with a lot of information, it doesn't read like an encyclopedia. Nice job."
2,only one,"There is only one stylus! I know it doesn't say that it is a three-pack but it also does not say that there is only one. It is not worth the price plus s/h. It it a VERY cheap, thin stylus. My son likes it now but we'll see how long it actually lasts before breaking."
2,Nintendo DS metal extendable stylus,I wanted a longer stylus for my DS so I ordered this stylus. unfortunately it doesnt fit the hole in the DS. The stylus is too small. the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a one is because it is weighty.
5,How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive 19 Ed,Very simple repair manual good even for someone that is not a do-it-urselfer. Lots of good information.
5,All you'll ever need (besides tools),"An earlier edition of this book, much-battered and grease stained, kept my '66 Beetle alive (and me sane) back in my late, lamented college days. The tone of the text is a bit much sometimes, from a modern perspective - remember, it was written in the 1960s as a how-to manual for VW-owning hippies :) - but it's still a top-notch resource and a lot of fun besides. Aside from the usual technical data (where the bolts are, what order to remove things in, what the bits all do), there's also a lot of generally useful information that can be applied to any mechanical repair - safety tips for the shop, for instance, and my personal favorite, a quick-and-dirty metric-to-English tool substitution guide (to help the Sixties Microbus owner whose roadside wave of distress is answered by a guy driving an American car, you see). Break this information down succinctly: If you own one of the vehicles it covers, buy this book."
3,The VW book,"I brought this book hoping that it would explain how to install a metal sunroof in a 69 classic vw. Nope, no such luck. It's a great book for the repair of motor, wiring, and other important things. But it was no help for my problem. Maybe I can find other uses for the information it contains."
5,"Not exactly what I wanted, but a good book for beginners","I was expecting a more detailed guide to common problem. While many of the common things are here, some things are just ""too complicated"" and suggest you seek professional help. Unlike the Bentley books this one is not as much ""the right way to do things"" book as it is a ""look out for these problem things"" book. It can actually be a little difficult to find the paragraph which will help you with your problem. But if it's in there, you can be sure it will walk you through it, step-by-step. A great book that tries to covey knowledge instead of specifications. Work arounds are sometimes given which is good since the classic VW is well over 20-yrs old for the newest of the aircooled models (not counting Mexican models). If you own an aircooled VW, you need this book."
4,The Bible for VWs,Great book on the mechanical aspects of keeping your VW alive. There is some contradictory information but an good book overall and a must have.
5,A must read for VW owners,"For many years now this has been the bible for early aircooled Volkswagen owners or fanciers. This book tells you what to fix, and how to fix it even if you are completely un-skilled. I've worked on hundreds of VWs since 1959 so I have real expertise with these cars. Nonetheless I currently have 8 ( that's right eight ) copies.The best advise anyone can ever get if they have one of these vehicles or are thinking about getting one is to buy this book.Sincerely Tom"
3,Definitely NOT the best+,"Barely okay is more like it. Only three tracks by Chet Atkins, one of which- Hark the Herald Angels Sing - can't be among his best. Otherwise, way too much other instrumentation and vocal content. To add insult to injury, the entire CD is less than 27 minutes long. Look elsewhere."
3,Building A Brand,"Add this to the list of business books that you must read before you try to build a brand of your own. I also liked Micheal Levine's Guerilla PR Wired, which is great for taking on Internet branding."
4,Patricio Borghetti,My family members joke around with me saying that I am the only fan he has and that I'm the only one whose bought his CD. He sings good.
5,needed to get it for class,"So yes I had to buy this for class. It was cheaper than buying it from school and it arrived on time, so I'm happy."
3,I didn't learn anything I didn't already know.,This book may interest anyone who is/are not familiar we benefits of Omega 3..I still would like to become a patient of the author but so far have not found him.
4,Review of Omega book,The book is good for the most part. It was very informative and to the point. A lot of scientific explanations which help the reader understand the nutritional value of omegas. I say 90 % of those explanations were comprehensible from my point of view. I think the book is too short. More research needs to be done. More clinical studies. I just wish I could get more information on the alternative medications for bipolar disorder.
1,Beware!,"The product description for this item on this page will lead you to believe that you get the shower curtain & accessories as well for the $24.99 price. I fell for this & only got the shower curtain. You can bet I was angry! And because of Amazon.com repesenting Home Visions they both tryed to pass the blame to each other on why this happened. I'm not saying the product is not nice, just that I personally would not have payed this price for that item alone. I thought I was getting a great deal. Just proves, if it sounds to good to be true..........etc., etc."
4,"Atlas of the World, 12 Edition","The presentation, and paper are really good, for this a give a 100%I liked the topics, that the book explores. However, some of them are not very realistic, because are not updated, or fictitious, for example it says in there that Mexico has a political unrest, and the truth is that a very small fraction of Chiapas, one out of 32 states of Mexico has problems, like many countries in the world have, and they dont have that piece of information.Gisela Ramirez"
3,Comparing with Britannica,"Comparado con el Atlas de la Britannica, este no tiene nada que hacer. La claridad de los mapas, que es la esencia del Atlas, es bastante superior en la Britannica. Poseo la edición del año 1994 y me parece superior.Lo único que justifica la compra de este Atlas de la Oxford es que trae la información de geografía humana y política más actualizada. Además, lo interesante y útil de los pequeños planos o mapas de las últimas noticias mundiales (en este caso, medio oriente).Si desea actualizar su Britannica, mejor espere la nueva edición de ese Atlas."
5,Oxford World Atlas,"This rendition has a comprehensive coverage of the universe andour solar system in full color. There are pictures of earthquake zones and weather belts worldwide. Constellations of stars are depicted for astronomers . There is good coverage of the worldeconomic systems. The maps are easy to read and interpret.The boldface print makes for ease of identification of even thesmallest cities and towns. This book is perfect for any school project in geography, earth science, world history and a whole host of other academic constituencies. It is a worthy investmentif you have any children in school- at any level."
5,Great Atlas,We bought this atlas as a birthday gift for my husband's mother. She loves it and has thanked us for it several times. She likes to reference this book while she is watching television shows on the history channel.
5,Well done!,I haven't bought a new one in years. This has amazing detail and information. Glad I purchased this one. The whole office has been using it.
3,"Disappointed that ""Yorktown, VA"" is no where to be found","I purchased this atlas as a gift for my father (who is not online maps savvy), and was really hoping that it would list every known named town/city/village on Earth. But, I was really disappointed to find that Yorktown does not even appear in the index! I really wish the publisher would send me a replacement for free ;)Other than that, it's a decent atlas."
5,A Great General Purpose Atlas,"I compared this atlas to it's closest rival, the National Geographic Atlas and chose this one because it is smaller and lighter. The NG Atlas is just too heavy to hold on your lap or get off a bookshelf. Also, I can't explain why, but I have never liked the format of NG maps.The Oxford Atlas has more pages of maps, but since the NG Atlas is larger the level of detail is comparable."
3,Mishmash of alternate takes fails to satisfy,"CD deserve a lot better than this. If you are new to them, this is NOT the place to start: instead, look for Only Theatre of Pain or Catastrophe Ballet in their full length original brilliance...this mish-mash of alternates to the original studio masterpieces will only satisfy the DIE HARD fan who already owns the originals, and wants a remix or is curious to hear the demos. All-n-all, since I am such a fan, I found this a nice treat to compliment the fully satisfying original releases."
5,Long live Rozz Williams,"The minute I saw this CD, I had to have it. Thus far, one of my best music purchases in the past few months. While I was disappointed that my favorite song, ""Dogs"" was not on the album, I was ultra impressed. It's a shame the genius of Williams will no longer be put out, but thank God (if there is one, highly doubtful) for recordings."
4,Very Well Researched and Written,"Sanders did an excellent journalistic job in understanding and explaining the reasons behind the growth of America's fastest-growing religion, Wicca. The book is definitely written from a Christian point of view, and as such may turn off some readers. However, it is not preachy, nor does it bombard the reader with proof texts on why Wicca is wrong. Instead, Sanders focuses on some things missing from traditional Christian practice that are present in Wicca, and how that appeal leads many to adopt it.I was hoping for a more thorough examination of Wiccan beliefs, though I realize this was not the author's aims. She does confess that, with so many forms and movements out there, it's difficult to define Wiccan belief and practice."
1,Very disappointed,"With a title like Experiential Marketing, I thought the book would practice what it preached. Instead it took an exciting subject and made elementary points dull and uninspiring."
4,Pearl Jam's Original Sound,"I was fairly pleased when I bought this album; a classic Pearl Jam album with some cool songs. There are a few duds on this album, but for all the good songs -it's worth it. This album is my second favorite from Pearl Jam. I like ""Ten"" more than anything else."
4,krista,"This is my FAv Pearl Jam C.D. It's a little heavier than TEN. Some good songs are Dissident, ANimal Blood, and Glorified G also Rats is good"
5,This album has NO throwaway tracks,"This album doesn't miss a note or a beat. It's as good as Ten, arguably better; and hasn't had it's hits as ruthlessly burned out by radio airplay. Each song exhibits Pearl Jam's signature style, yet each is distinct. And every song is solid. ""Glorified G"" takes a fierce stance against gun possession while ""Blood"" deals with the topic of drug abuse. And ""Rats"" (which makes a cool tribute to Michael Jackson's ""Ben"") is a sort of forerunner to Yield's great tune ""Do the Evolution"". Both take jabs at the human race, pulling no punches and making no apologies. Besides that, they're just great songs; hardly filler material.Vs is at times rocking, reflective, exultant and despondent, sometimes all at once, yet maintains a consistent tone throughout; a solid, awesome effort."
2,Suffered from the sophomore slump?,"I usually like PJ. This is so forgettable, I have forgotten which tracks are which. I liked Ten, as it had the more memorable songs. But this? It's more filler, which has four good songs, the rest being forgettable. ""Rearviewmirror"" happens to be my favorite of the tracks on this album, giving it the credit. ""Daugher"" is one of the other good songs, and these two were the only ones good enough for that extra star. But they did prove me that they could do better. My one-star is saved for No Code, despite a cool album cover.Back to Vs. this album is for hard-core PJ fans/grunge fans or people who like attention span music. Not that I don't listen to attention span music, but I just didn't like it. Look at the other reviews, you'll prolly agree with those."
1,From Ten to this??????,"After the success of Ten, Pearl Jam got angry at being called metal (boo hoo) so they went in this crappy direction. This album is bad, Thank god the salesof their albums nose dived after Pearl Jam took a step in this direction."
1,Not a remote control as advertised,"This car was on the page labeled remote control. I was very disappointed when it was received. I was advised on the website that it could not be returned for credit. I am very disappointed. A beautiful car, but I wanted it to be a remote controlled car."
5,nevermore's best..,"this is one of those albums that you can go and pick up anytime you dont know what to listen to and it is more entertaining each time. The guitar work is killer, as well as the drumming. One of my favorite albums forsure \m/"
4,I Stand Before You A Shadow of A Man,"Wow! What the hell was going through Dane's mind upon completing this wonderfully intoxicating album? The guitars are astounding while backing up the well-known cries of emotion. I have never been so blown away upon the first listen of a cd before in my life! The story behind the lyrics is true. The cd is about a friend/lover that the lead singer lost to a religious cult(she was murdered). This album explains each step of mourning and each void that is felt as he greives for his lost love. It sounds depressing, but the cd really gets you involved with great sound effects (listen to it through headphones) and musical concepts soo rich that you could swim through them! By the end of the cd, you too will felt like you've eaten the lotus flower (get the cd, you'll understand)."
3,So close and yet so far,"Although I'm an adult, I started to read On Wings of a Dragon with great interest. The plot was thrilling, the characters intriguing. Unfortunately, it all spins out of the author's control in the final chapters. The explanations that one is looking for from the very first chapters--Who is Kour'el? Why did she come? What is the vessel?--are either answered very weakly, or not at all. So what should have been a satisfying climax is instead a disappointing letdown. And it sounds like a sequel is not planned (or possible?) either, so there is no chance that my many questions will be answered in some future book. How annoying..."
3,Not as durable as I hoped,"This looked great at first and I thought for sure it would last, but no such luck. My JRT easily chewed pieces off, so had to take the toy away. It was heavy and hard to squeak, so I thought it might be too tough or her, but I was wrong! I have jolly balls for my horses and they are quite durable, but don't get the dedicated chewing that a terrier can inflict. It might be better or a fetch toy for a larger dog or less hardy chewer."
5,Excellent Value!,This item came very quickly and works as advertised. AND comes at a price that is easily 20-25% cheaper than anywhere else.
5,New Possibilities,"This book has created new possibilities for my doubles game and I can see how this system will work for anyone. It's thought provoking, inspirational and well organized. The book flows with great positive energy. The visuals really helped integrate each lesson and deepened my understanding on the court. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to develop their game and learn more of life's lessons."
4,Unlimited Doubles,"I purchased this book after a friend had given me a heads-up that this will strengthen your doubles game ""big-time!"". Well I am early in the process of working on this book's suggestions, however I would highly recommend this book! The thought process and point discussions, as well as drills are great, and I only wish that I had read this earlier in the USTA season. CJ"
2,Not my favorite by any stretch,What can I say....I couldn't get through this book. Every other page the two main characters are jumping each other's bones leaving little room for any real story. Yawn.... I give up.
5,Great Read,Really enjoyed this book. Anyone planning a PCT hike would appreciate this book. Interesting to read the thoughts/perspective of someone outside the USA as they hike through this diverse trail.
3,A Tale Worthy of Franz Kafka,"This is the English translation of El Cantor de Tango. It slowly becomes a very surrealistic book with magical realism thrown in all over the place. Toward the last 100 pages of the book, you find yourself in a town that is a labyrinth of facades and moving landmarks that makes you feel either dizzy or crazy. Maybe it reads better in Spanish, but I doubt it. I still have a few pages to go and maybe I'll get into it soon."
3,"A Better Anthology: Right Stuff ""Owes Us One!""","Right Stuff/EMI/Capitol has a lot to learn about picking the best Shalamar cuts for the Anthology collection. First of all, the repetitive crappy long remix of ""Right In The Socket"" should have been replaced with the better, yet funkier album version. Second of all, the Collection could have survived without the later cuts from the post Howard Hewitt era (except for ""Games"", because that was the jam). Third of all, some of the radio friendly and charted memorable songs are missing such as ""I Owe You One, There It Is, Friends, You Won't Miss Love Till Its Gone and My Girl Loves Me (video version)."" Other than the last two songs on the anthology, ""Go For It"" and ""Right In The Socket Remix,"" the selections were decent, but only if they added those songs I mentioned that were missing. I would rather spend a little more money and get all their cds (except for their last two cds and Go For It because they were awful)."
1,George Carlin - Bad Day for Ya,"I really like George Carlin, but I only watched TV performances which limit the type and amount of profanity. It was always funny when they bleeped the 7 words, but if they did that to this DVD, all that you would hear is bleep, bleep, bleep. George seem to try to put as much F#@K this, F#@K that as he could pack into the act and I think that it ruined what could have been a funnier performance. If you like profanity...Go For It!"
4,pretty good dvd,"while not the best he has ever done, this dvd stands well as a final tribute to his work. Its rough in some spots yet over all very entertaining."
1,Defective,"I was very disappointed with the MT-14EX Macro Ring Lite. I attached it to the top of the camera one time and it has locked on!! Please excuse my lack of appropriate terminology, but I will try to explain this as simply as possible: I cannot turn the plastic dial to loosen and remove it. It would appear that part of the metal slide has dug into the plastic dial preventing it from loosening any further. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, how did you fix it? Thank you-"
4,Good Buy !,"Can't really go wrong with this star studded performance except, in my opinion, the cello was not as loud as it should be. I want to hear all three instruments juxtaposed in this trio as was billed. I prefer pianos with more depth and tone than this one, although it does sound lively and pretty. I prefer sharper crisp violin tone, as this one had more of a lulling gypsy esq sound. Chopin himself later wrote he should have written the violin part for the viola, maybe this is why it doesn't work well to me. However, this recording is graceful, polished, and neat!I like how the Polonaise brilliant was recorded twice on this cd once as a trio and again with just the piano! This gives the disc a true bargin appeal. Overall a great addition to my collection from a reputable labelGood day !"
2,Not Vintage Chopin,"The recording of Chopin's works is excellent. That is to say the musicians bring a wonderful energy and depth to the pieces. It's just that my favorite composer, Frederic, seems almost awkward in the creation of these sonatas, both piano and cello. Each has a kind of shallow quality not found in the composer's brilliant ballads, scherzos, short piano pieces and concerti. Still, his sonatas, remain far more substantial, in my mind, than the ponderous ""sturm und drang"" chamber music of Brahms and the ""ride 'em cowboy, 19th Century Dvorak. However, chamber music remains magical in the canons of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Debussy, whose late and delicately magnificent chamber music seems almost too good for people."
5,Unbelievably comfortable!,"For some reason which still eludes me, Amazon would not ship these boots to me on Guam. I bought them elsewhere, and must say they are far and away the most comfortable boots I have ever worn. For those of you who will wear them with a military or police uniform, you might want to remove the big ""Converse"" logo from the tongue. Other than that, they are wonderful. I'm going to buy another pair, so I can rotate them and wear them daily."
2,Yancey-lite,"A short book, but too long. Read like a tract and could have been presented in a long pamphlet. I generally like Yancey, but you can skip this and re-read WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT GRACE. My favorite."
5,Sony KDL-46S2010 Review,We are very satisfied with our new HDTV. Easy to hook up. Great price. Excellent picture even though we are currently on cable. We feel this was a great buy.
2,Sizing is a little unusual..............,"The sizing on this runs a little small at the waist and long at the arms. Also, this should be called a jacket, not a parka. It's thin and doesn't keep me warm in the cold winter snowy days. I prefer my outerwear to be long at the waist area and I thought it would be since that's why they are called parkas, but nope. I got an XL by the way."
3,Too limited in scope. Read Thomas Sowell first.,"This book is meant to infuriate, enrage, engage and bother us. I, for one, hope it succeeds. I am always impressed whenever I see a black intellectual of stature challenge the status quo.The biggest problem I had this book had more to do with my expectations than anything. I'd just read Sowell's ""Ethnic America"" and I hoped that this book would be similar. It left me wanting. Sowell contained facts and statistic, McWhorter, opinions. Sowell was emotionally detatched and objective, McWhorter left me feeling as if he looked down on the people he wrote about.The other problem is that I found myself saying ""Yeah, but white, asian, puerto rican, latino kids. They all have these problems too"". We've all seen Jerry Springer. It's not just one racial group, it's an entire generation. All in all though, it's a good book. Just don't forget to back it up with Thomas Sowell, and if you liked this book, read MacDonald's ""The Burden of Bad Ideas."""
4,Good Book,"I received this book about 5 days after it should have been here. Other than that it is a good book, but, it's almost identical to the other book I already ordered, called: (Safety & Security: For Women Who Travel). They both give the same advice almost word for word. But, I still enjoyed reading it."
4,Works great!.,"I had to buy about 2 of these when I started using them. They are small, efficient but do not last forever. But at the price point, i can afford to buy a couple of replacements once in a while. Recommend for those interested in self portraits or prefer to shoot with controls."
5,Wireless Remote Control RC1,"This Remote was bought as a gift, and the recipient was very pleased. She said she really liked the fact it attached to the strap on the camera so it was always right there. Also commented on how easy the set-up was."
5,Perfect,I have used it up to about 20ft. away. Maybe it goes further. Original battery for over a year. only bad thing is you have to use it in front of the camera but off to the side is ok and out of the shot.
3,Very Limited,"Works only within a very narrow line-of-sight.If you have any lens longer than a 50mm, the remote becomes very difficult to use from in front of the camera. Even with a 50mm using a lens hood, it's very difficult.With a hooded 16-35 or a 100 macro, forget about it. The IR signal gets blocked by the lenses and hoods.Your best (and only) bet is to use the 2 sec delay so you have time to aim the remote, then reposition your arm.Canon really should consider changing the placement of the IR sensors on all of their cameras so that Canon IR remotes are actually useful with Canon cameras."
3,OK.,"This is an OK remote. We use it with my wife's Rebel XTI. It gets the job done eventually. It doesn't always take the shot when you want it to, so you'll end up with some interesting photos. It's better than setting the timer, and running to you spot though."
4,Awesome Product!,"I just received my Canon Remote RC-1 to be used with my Canon Rebel XTi. The instructions were a lil hard to understand but it's only because I'm a newbie to all this. Once I came here and read some of the comments others left, I realized that I didn't have the camera set to Self Timer/Remote Mode. All is well now.Also wanted to point out that it was a little slow at taking the photos. I had to press the button a few times to take the photo. It might be human error. (like I said, I'm new to all this).Bottom line, this is a great product and it's price is unbeatable. Best there is out there.Thanks, E"
3,"Canon Wireless IR Remote, Remote Control for the Canon Digital Rebel, remote control",I enjoy using the Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1. The only drawback is that it is a line-of-sight controller and it needs to be in front of the camera to operate properly. The Canon radio control remote is more handy and can operate from behind the camera and for greater distances... but the radio control remote cost more.
5,Great for remote or night shots,This is a must if you intend on being in the picture or if you want to take pictures at night. Great buy.
4,Pretty good camera remote.,"Works great for our Rebel T1i! As I had read, you do need to be in front of the camera and have line of sight. I love the 2 second delay in order to hide the remote in family shots. Easily clips to camera strap."
4,Happy to find a remote for my old EOS Elan Film SLR,This is exactly what came with my EOS Elan when I bought it. It is just a very basic remote but it allows me to do things like group photos with me in them and makes it easier to do better stitched together panoramas. I am happy that this remote was still available for a camera that is over ten years old. The folks at Yongnuo did a great job of packing and very quick shipping.
2,ok i guess..In door use only!,Not what i was Hoping for. If your out side and it's sunny out you can forget useing this. It works if its indoors or its cloudy out. Interface is east to use and intigration with eos digital rebel is smooth. You can only go back about 16 feet with it to take a pic withougt haveing to wave it around like a lunitick for it to release the shutter. I am defently going to find an rf shuter release for my camera Enough of ir. if you plan on useing this inside then this is perfect for you!
1,Don't buy this remote for portraits,I bought this remote to use in studio work. I wasted my money. Try getting the perfect smile on a baby and then finagling around trying to get your camera to take the picture.
5,Handy and easy to use,Small and clips to your camera's strap. Easy to use for both long exposure shots and group shots using a tripod!
5,Very handy little remote.,"I recently got this remote and I love it. I mean whats so special about a remote? Well it's wireless and you don't have to set the timer and run to get into the picture. I have used it for landscape pictures on my tripod to reduce camera shake. It was very cool to set up the shot, wait for the camera to be still and then take the shot. If you have a camera that works with this remote (I have the Canon Rebel XT) and want a remote, get it. It is compact, appears sturdy and works well. It comes with a clip to put it on your camera strap that covers the button so it doesn't get pressed when it is mounted into the clip."
3,Overall pretty good,"Works pretty good to capture things such as family photos. It does seam a bit ""touchy"" in that you have to get it pointed at the camera perfect."
3,Doesn't work with the Canon 30D,"Can't understand why it doesn't work with the Canon 30D, but does with many other Canon cameras. There seems to be no wireless remotes for the 30D. It does work fine with the XT."
5,A great remote. It also attaches to the strap!,"This is a gret remote for an IR remote. Yes it is limited to line of sight and 16 feet (as advertised). But given that it IS an infrared remote this remote is just about perfect.The slide switch has 3 positions Lock, Instant shutter, and 2 second delay.But the BEST feature (which is not list in the description) is that the remote comes with a clip that holds it to the camera strap. You can leave this thing on the strap so you always have it with you. When you need it, press a button and pop it off the clip. If I had known that the choice between the rc-1 and the rc-5 would have been easier."
4,Interesting,"It's very usefull. By this price, should be bought by every Rebel owner. I like specially cause you don't have to press the shutter, so minimizes the chance of bad pictures."
4,A good buy,"I bought the remote control so that I could trip the shutter while my camera was on a tripod. Mostly landscape stuff. It works great for my intended use. The only minor problem is that you have to point the remote control at the front of the camera. I have found that it works fine if I hold the remote in front of, and below the lens (out of view of the lens)."
4,Very Handy Gizmo,"I'd like to echo what a few other people have already said and say that this should come in the box with the camera! I really like the ability to switch between immediate shutter release and a 2 second delay, for either long exposures, and for group photos, so you can put it away before the shutter releases. I keep mine clipped onto the neck strap all the time and it is very securely attached."
5,Cute little guy,I got this for a small sand bottom tank that houses snails. the leaves are smooth edged and broad enough for any little climbers and the suction cup base allows for a firmer hold and a thinner layer of sand. not having to pile it up around a large rock or plastic base is great
3,Laundry care,Smaller than I had hoped. Doesn't roll well because it's top heavy from the clothes hanger. I still opted to keep it because it means I don't have to carry the laundry baskets any more. Wouldn't buy another.
1,"Cheap plastic, slips put of position",I weigh 215. The middle of the board definitely flexes under my weight. The slots to adjust the height slipped out of position at the 2nd level- felt unsafe.. In this case cheaper definitely reflects lack of quality.
5,Shawn Carter's True Vision,"In the intro to the first song, Jay is lamenting the death of a friend that has died. The words he left to his friends and family were those immortalized by the Great Sinatra, ""I did it my way."" So, Jay-Z says, ""I have no choice but to do it my way."" Jay-Z succeeds admirably. His vision and intelligence, his focus, are so clear on this first single and the style is very similar to his first album, although it was not a great commercial success. He was forced to make radio friendly bangers with his consecutive CDs, but to see how the man that has now mastered to rap game first started out, I suggest this single as well as Reasonable Doubt."
5,"The real deal, and a good deal!","I did not expect a lot, given the price. Boy howdy, was this a pleasant surprise!The jacket is well made of very thick but flexible leather, fit is just loose enough for a down vest underneath. No wind leaks, nothing flutters at 65mph with a 40 mph headwind. Looks and feels hefty enough to be good protection. Even the zippers work well.The only downside I see is that it smells different. Not bad, just different. I'd buy this again."
4,Another side of Queen Latifah!,"She has a great voice & I enjoyed this CD. There were only a couple of songs that I thought were ""overdone,"" but I recommend this CD for those who enjoy the standards and Dana's talented vocals and delivery."
4,Entertaining Music,"I first heard this album while dining at Paul's Monterrey Inn in Albuquerque, NM this past weekend. With every song that played everyone in my party kept making comments about how wonderful the music sounds. Very soothing and relaxing with great rhythm. I purchased a copy for myself and another for my father as a gift. Ms. Owens has an awesome voice and it is perfectly demonstrated on this CD. Great album!!! I recommend purchasing it."
4,Business Globalization Requires Positive Thinking,"As schools of management extend their brands worldwide, one of the most important elements missing may be cultural awareness. ""The Power of Positive Thinking in Business"" calls attention to an important element in global business...the individual's role as he/she works globally but lives locally. It is all too easy for business strategies to overlook this crucial, often cultural take on behavior in the business workplace, a workplace that is often now cyber dislocated. Asking the 10 key questions may not change the world, but they surely assist in an individual seeing where he fits in the ethical spectrum. A very valuable exercise."
1,Way too BIG!!!,"This perch was purchased for a cockatiel, which is the bird in the picture, and the product is much larger and is rated for ""parrots and large birds. Of course it will go back to AmazonPenn Plax Cement Perch, Conditions Birds Leg Muscles, 10-Inch."
2,Warning - Bad Design,"This case is terrible. The construction is excellent however it's all for naught as the individual sleeves keep falling out. And since they're individual, it takes twice the amount of time to find the cd you're looking for as you have to thumb through everything twice. I've since taken out the sleeves and use it as a toiletry travel case, thus the extra star."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The topics that are covered in this book are interesting, but they're not sufficient to secure your machine. If you want a book that will show you from start to finish what you should do, this is not the book. If you want to learn some weird hacks (in the positive, old-school definition of the word) this may be fun. But if you want to secure your machine, having read only this book will leave you open to many vulnerabilites. I strongly suggest that you get Hacking Exposed Linux 2nd Edition instead -- it is very complete."
4,One of the 4-Hs shouldn't be.,"This book dispels the common myths of Haitians and AIDS. It also shows very clearly the heavy involvement of the United States in creating the poverty Haiti has faced. This book makes use of statistics well, but unfortunately, at this point those stats are many years old. When Farmer wrote this book, only three people in the village of Do Kay had died of AIDS. Now, with huge percentages of Haitians exposed to HIV, the picture must certainly look different. This book is a geat candidate for a revised edition some time in the future."
1,An imitator's imitator,"Yet another EngLit dept no-talent, as sadly lacking in talent and a voice (any voice, even a bad one) of his own - STD is the poetic equivalent of the those talentless middle class children of the 70's who learned to fake a working class accent and repackaged themselves as ""punks""."
5,Perfect Album,"A Perfect Album full of perfect hooks, written by perfect musicians in perfect land.Maybe thats a bit of an exxageration but i can say honestly that i personally cant see a flaw in this beautiful collection of songs and i have owned this Album for about a year now. i still cant get enough of it.Hope they put out another album sooner rather than later"
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I am satisfied with this purchase, although I wish I had purchased a hard cover since the pages seem a bit faded out. It is the same story and pictures as what I remember from the original old book from when I was a child. It was definitely worth the price--great story."
3,Fruit of Loom T Shirt Shrinks ALOT,"Shirt fit great till it was washed and dryed. I am bigger and taller than average,4X, after 1st wash and dry it must have took 4 inches off length. I ordered the Hanes T Shirts at the same time, not near as much shrinkage."
1,GARBAGE,"I won better t-shirts at the local fair. These are the worst quality t-shirts on the market. Stiff, thin and nothing like the Fruit of the Loom you would expect. Do not buy them. Go to your local JCPenny and pick up some nice soft t-shirts and you won't be dissapointed."
1,Lightweight T-shirt,"Even though the label and ad say ""heavy cotton"", this is not. This is one of the lightest t-shirts I've seen. Shame on Fruit-Of The-Loom for deceptive advertising."
1,fussy and silly,"Yet another married, virgin bride. It is just not believable that any noble would marry and have no plans to having an heir. Any regency gal who was raised in the Ton would know that is almost her primary role. Both Victoria and Claredon would know that any marriage not comsumated would not be binding or legal. I wait for the day when some smart regency writer will incorporate that certain truth into a much better story. Also - Victoria's constant anger towards Claredon was overdone. He did not know who she was when he went to her room; she was the one using a false name and he did marry her. She was the real problem. Again, regency authors try to make their chits feisty, like that is supposed to make them interesting or smart when all it does is make you want to cringe!"
3,Skip this one.,"First of all, I'd like to say that I use the Artscroll Machzorim for Rosh HaShana, Yom Kippur and Pesach. This machzor however tries to cover too many Yom Tovim (Succot, Chol HaMoed Succot, Hoshana Raba, Shmini Atzeret and Simchat Torah). You end up flicking pages forwards and backwards too many times. In my opinion, you are better off using the standard Arscroll Siddur and buying a guide to Succot.One more point. Do NOT!, I repeat DO NOT use this machzor in Eretz Yisrael. There are simply too many differences. Because those privilaged to live in Eretz Yisrael only have one day Yomtov Succot and a combined Shmini Atzeret/Simchat Torah, this machzor will totally confuse you."
2,Mixed feelings,"I bought both the OXO Good Grips Toilet Plunger, and matching Toilet brush, partly because the reviews on Amazon were all good. They are both twice the size that I expected and take up LOTS of room next to the toilet. The rubber on the plunger smells very toxic and the smell is overpowering. I'm sure the smell will decrease over time. The mechanism that houses both the plunger and brush seems flimsy and not at all long lasting and the plastic halves don't line up very well. It's a hassle to send them back but I think I will have to."
4,Now i can speak simple phrases to my grandma!,"This book has alot of helpful information, and it actually explains how the differnt tense and verb modifications are made. The phrases it contains may help you visit the country. overall for the tourist its a great book, for anyone serious about learning latvian, look elsewhere."
5,Moose Goose and Little Nobody,"This book is about a little mouse searching for mom with the help of some friends. I haven't read it in a while, but I loved it as a child!"
4,More fun Bowie covers,"If you're a Bowie completist, then you'll have to have this no matter what, but even if you're a casual fan this is a fun CD. Standout tracks include a really interesting version of ""China Girl"" and a truly Gothic approach to the already goth ""Cat People"". And, of course, it's almost impossible to do a bad version of ""Heroes"" or ""Scary Monsters"". Most arrangements are departures from the traditional Bowie arrangements, which is refreshing. Speaking as a Bowie fan and not a goth fan- this is a pretty cool CD."
2,Somewhat disappointed,I was somewhat disappointed! Not exactly what I hoped for! Would not recommend this one for the serious inspired seeker.
2,Brilliantly Boring,"Very well-written, but nothing really happens. I had to really push to finish reading this and was ultimately disappointed. I've already forgotten what the book was about."
5,A great accessory,"Canon's remote shutter release cable is very well built and performs beautifully. A must have if you are going to be taking any shots using a slow shutter speed. The button is responsive and the tactile feedback makes it easy to differentiate between autofocus and shutter release. It even has grooved sides and a notch on top and bottom to securely wrap the cable and is topped off with a hole to insert the plug for nice tidy storage. Don't think about it, just buy it!"
5,works great,"works much better than aftermarket release. definitely buy. some people say the cord is too short but its the perfect length. if you want a longer cord go to your local radio shack and purchase rca cables i believe, and a couple reducer pieces. if you go there and bring the shutter release you should be able to find everything that youu need. i have roughly 30 ft of cable now, which is nice to be able to set the camera outside near a busy bird feeder go inside and creep out a window and fire away. ive gotten some pretty amazing backyard bird pictures this way."
5,Get this gadget!,"I wasn't sure if I'd actually use this when I bought it but it's turned into one of my favorite accessories! Anytime I'm shooting on a tripod I'm using this remote. Obviously it's not helpful if you (the photographer) also need to be in the shot, get the wireless for that. I always carry both this and the wireless remote in my bag, they each serve their own purpose and don't take up much room."
4,Love it!,LOVE this item! Only wish it had a little longer cord. There are no regrets in buying the canon brand remote.
4,Should have got this instead of the knock off,"This works so much better than the cheap unit I bought. I should have got this the first time well made and works great, The only issue is the cord is to short needs to be 2 feet longer. One star off for that."
5,Buena calidad,"Si tomamos en cuenta lo sencillo del accesorio y el precio de venta no podemos esperar otra cosa que un perfecto funcionamiento y una buena calidad de diseño y construcción.Dispara la cámara en cualquier situación y en cualquier programación que estemos utilizando (lo único que no probé fue su capacidad para activar el autofoco pero en la web mucha gente asegura que lo hace perfectamente) y puede mantener el disparador en modo Bulb con un seguro que evita que mantengamos presionado el botón del control.El cable permite disparar aproximadamente a 60cm de distancia de la cámara.If we take in consideration the simplicity of the device and its relative high price, we can not expect nothing but high construction quality.It works in any camera mode, and activates the auto focus too, with two step button travel like camera shutter.The cord is approx. two feet long."
3,Poorly made. But still nice.,"Sure it's poorly made. And very over priced for what it actually is, but it's definitely a handy item to have in a gear bag. I'm glad I got it. I would probably even recommend it to a friend."
2,"Fine for occassional use, breaks under heavy use :-(","I take a lot of pictures that requires the camera to be mounted on a tripod. Using this remote shutter release seemed like the obvious choice. However after receiving the switch, I noticed the switch mechanism seemed a bit cheap. Well, I was right. After a few months of daily use, the switch quit working. Even before it quit, the switch started acting finicky and wouldn't take the shot right away. I still needed to take photos so I bought a second one. Just like the first, it stopped working in a few months too, ARRGHHHH!!! After the second one failed, I bought the wireless remote control RC1. I wish I bought that the first time. It works so much better and without any wires to get in the way. The only downside is you can't take a photo from behind the camera with the wireless. I guess you can't have everything. I strongly recommend you skip buying this poorly made switch on buy the wireless switch instead. You will be much happier."
1,Not compatible with Canon EOS 7D,"Unlike the posting and the description of this product on Amazon, this product is in no way compatible to Canon EOS 7D. The posting on Amazon describess it as suitable for Canon EOS camera, but having received it to day I found out that the conncetor does not match my 7D camera jack. Very disappointed since I have a photoshoot tomorrow and was counting on this. Also, I paid the shipping costs as well. I hope future buyers who own a 7D read this review and I hope the description is corrected on Amazon as soon as possible."
4,Alright I guess,"It could be longer, works great for what I need it for normally but would enjoy a longer cable but that is cannons fault not this vendor. I have had no probs with this item.Bill"
4,Fits my Rebel 2000 just fine,"The UV filter is nice and helps protect the lens, plus is designed so that the same lens cap that came with my Rebel 2000 Kit fits over the filter as well. No problems with the batteries or the UV filter fitting my Canon EOS Rebel 2000. Cleaning kit is ample, although some cleaning care instructions would have made this product better."
4,Subliminal education disguised as an enjoyable mystery,"Learning the history and legends of the Camino can be a sleep inducing task, but after reading and enjoying this whodonit by Elyn Aviva, complete with dead bodies and beautiful women, I realised that I had painlessly learned a lot about the Camino de Santiago. It has an appeal similar to a Tony Hillerman or James Burke novel, in that the detailed local information of the mystery captures readers who are familiar with the region where the story takes place. I won't give any of the plot away, but if you have ever walked the Camino or looked into walking it, you will not be able to put this down."
1,Disappointing,"Maybe I just got the bad one in the bunch, but the production in this video is horrible. I can't hear a word she's saying over the music. I've done enough step that I could follow - and it seems like a fun workout, but too short. Good luck - hope you don't get one like mine."
1,THIS WOULD NOT BE THE STEP REEBOK VIDEO TO GET FIT TO.,"THE VIDEO WAS BORING. GO WITH SOMETHING MORE MOTIVATING. SUCH AS, THE ORIGINAL STEP REEBOK,WHICH, FOR SOME REASON, CANNOT BE ORDERED FROM AMAZON. I WISH IT COULD BE BECAUSE MINE IS OLD AND WORN OUT. WHAT A DRAG. NOW YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW GREAT IT IS. BUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON DANCE STEP."
3,"Great service, questionable product","This was the cheapest price I was able to find anywhere, even after factoring in shipping. And the shipping was very fast indeed. My only problem is the bubble wrap itself hasn't held up so far. Granted I'm still closer to the outside of the roll, but the bubbles are either already flat or lose air as soon as you apply pressure. There's no popping here b/c it doesn't provide that much resistance. I'm hoping it gets better the deeper I work into the roll, but you shouldn't have to work through 1/4 of the product to get what you were expecting all along."
4,bubble wrap love,perfect. came quickly. exactly what i needed to do some wrapping. good price. free shipping.
1,What happened here?,"This record's a dud, and it pains me to say this because, as a Bostonian, I have nothing but love for the New Edition and its members. But you'd have to ask why BBD bother to make a comeback record with this swill. Women don't get a fair shake in these songs as they're all treated like inflatable dolls. As much as I wanna give these fellow local bruhs credit, I have to say that this record embarasses me."
1,A Waste of time,funny this is the Real Version of New Edition unlike the Act they put over back in the 80's.but sadly nobody is gonna buy into what they are representing now in there Words&Music.it was only about 11-12 years back they mattered in what went for R&B&Pop.but that seems like Centurys ago when you hear the Junk that goes for music here.BBD had a Impact for a Minute but this is a Record strictly to finish out a deal I have to believe.
5,Set of 5 Open-Hole Flute Plugs,These flute plugs will also fit in a F.E. Olds open hole flute. Would not fit in an Emerson brand.
3,Good Album,Sunday Street is a good CD with plenty of great songs by Dave Van Ronk but it isn't as complete a picture of Van Ronk's music as Inside Dave Van Ronk
1,website connected book without a website,"This series of mysteries (Digital Detectives) requires that you read part of the story, picking up clues and information. Then you are to go to the books website to search for more clues and directions on how to solve the mystery and proceed with your reading in the book. ONE BIG PROBLEM.. the WEB SITE IS NOT FUNCTIONING....IT's NOT AVAILABLE..For the last month we have been trying to access the website...but no response... Numerous contacts with the publisher have been met with empty promises.. Yes, we are aware of the problem. Yes, someone is looking into it. Yes, we will have the technical problems worked out by next week...hopefully. And that was close to a month ago. Still no functioning website. My words of advice about this series...don't buy it! The publisher is not supporting the website, and without the website, the mystery is dead in the water."
1,BUMMER!,My daughter received this book for free at a school function. She was really excited about it and started reading right away. On page 22 you have to log on to a website that no longer exists in order to figure out what page to read next.She is SO disappointed. STAY AWAY from this book. I've done a lot of research and have found all kinds of complaints that the website is GONE and has been for MANY years.Don't waste your time.
3,Bindings,"Bindingswere no good, most of the glue that holds the book together was worn away, I know that it was a USED book, but how are you suppose to flip pages when all you can think about are the pages coming out"
3,Don't recall,I'm certain it looked interesting but don't recall even recieving it so I couldn't have been that impressed. I don't recall.
2,Fell apart,We bought this for our 2 year old and it broke after using it 3 times. Another piece of trash from china.
4,Big Dig Delivers Thus Far,"I purchased this Big Dig for my three year old son. Since we put it together he has been playing with it almost constantly. It was very easy to assemble and came in a small, neat package. So far it is living up to expectation in terms of enjoyment and price.The unit we recieved is not exactly yellow in color as shown in the product picture. Ours was a darker yellow. I am satisfied with this purchase."
2,Please give this message to Canon,"The case itself is nice, in some of the reviews I read that some of the cases have a pouch...Mine didn't. Canon should have provieded each of it's customers the case FREE, having fork over so much money."
4,I thought the book was fun and a very good mystery,"I read this book years before it was ever made into a movie, which by the way i thought sucked bigtime. It held my interest and not too many books now days can do that. A nice piece of fiction."
3,Ramayana,"I had been looking forward to viewing this video ever since I heard about it a couple of years ago. I teach the Ramayana and had been looking for a good animation. The previews and reviews looked promising. The animation in this movie is great. The students enjoyed it. We viewed it after reading the Ramayana and doing some work on it, so they knew the story well. On the one hand it was not a problem that it was not in English nor that it did not have subtitles, but I have to admit that I am awaiting either the subtitled version or the English version. If you know the story.....it is a must have!"
5,"Highly recommended, good to have at home","I bought this dvd because I couldn't get into a cpr class before my due date. I find it very helpful. In fact, once I was able to get into a cpr class I found that they used this exact same dvd. It's not long, and it's to the point. The instructions are clear. I'm glad I have it. I recommend it, especially if you have a baby at home. Knowing what to do in case there is an emergency can make all the difference in the world."
5,amazing,as i have said my son is really interested in magic tricks.. and this has got to be his favorite set.. He had alot of fun the insturionts are easy to understand..
1,Poor quality,"Arrived damaged. The speaker/magnet part of the 15"" horn was broken off and loose inside of the box. The vinyl on the box was comming up on several parts. The overall quality was poor."
3,"Dry read, but good","This book does a nice job of taking a dry subject and presenting it in an interesting way. It is nice reading about different companies ""adventures"" in advertising. I specifically liked the phone companies story and its attempt to avoid being labeled a monopoly. It is worth your time if you are interested in advertising, but is a rather dense read."
5,Great,Hey it is John Denver! Product was easy to download and it brought back many memories of traveling in the car with my Mother!
5,for someone who doesn't know anything,"supposing that this book is accurate in what it explains (as a novice to investing I can't say whether it is) it was an awesome book to read because of its conciseness (something lacking in most books) and its clarity as to what means what. I don't plan to invest in individual stocks, bonds, futures, options anytime in the near future but at least I know what the hell those things are."
1,Won't work,I tried to use it to siphon gas out of my gas tank for the generator. I couldn't get it to work.
3,"Nice Concept, But Only Works Well In Certain Conditions","I bought this for siphoning old gas before storing various engines. It works well enough for equipment with larger fuel tanks like a riding lawnmower or motorcycle but is pretty much useless for smaller tanks like pushmowers or snowthrowers as the siphon requires a good 4""+ in vertical liquid height in order to provide enough pressure from shaking to start the siphon."
5,safety sipon 00101,Safety Siphon with self priming pump the large one 00101 is really great for filling your boat with gas. It is easy and fast. GREAT PRODUCT
3,When saving money hurts your customer,"Let me say first, this is a great idea and works as it advertised.But why on earth is the hose that short? They saved a few cents putting a short hose on it and make it very difficult to use in a lot of setup.Check before buying if length is enough for you."
1,A total waste of money!,"Bad audio, lousy picture quality. Enough said? Do yourself a favor: do not buy this insult to dvd technology."
3,Just for Oscar Fans!,"This kind of DVD is just for Orcar Fans, because it have a lot of information. I don't like the editing, the menues, the extras (plain), etc.Grate idea, but bad execution."
1,noe wisker at a time,"I have an expensive Norelco 3 year old razor and it has given me nothing but trouble. Under warranty the hole head was replaced and now a hole by the switch. No more water resistant in the shower. It has never worked very well in shaving, it cost $200 and I purchased a $49 that works better. It seems to me that something like water proofing should last longer than 3 years"
2,WASHINGTON flyfishing guide,"Really didn't explain much except during peak fishing times. I was not able to be there then, so was very disapointed."
2,nip/tuck,The soundtrack on the TV show are typically a different style than what is on the CD. It wasn't what I had expected.
5,Great depth and passion,"Every track is beautifully crafted. The combination of flamenco guitar, violin, the occassional harmonica, and other ethnic instruments create an atmosphere of mystery. All music is instrumental except for one track where voices are electronically distorted and fused with violin."
1,old better than new,"I had the shaver for one year,after one year norelco says to renew the heads for better performance.Forget it save your money,the original worked better."
1,Bad news,The new blades are as dull as the old blades. I'll just buy a new cheap razor each year instead. Very disappointed
4,Norelco replacement heads,The shaver itself has the advantage over rechargeable of a lighter mass. The replacement heads worked fine but worked noticeably better at first than after a few shaves.
5,works as advertised,"i use this unit to shave my whole head! i have a beard. i get a clean close shave, no nicks and i have been getting a good shave out of it for about a year. this is my third replacement and i will reorder in another year"
4,Got what I expected.,"This was cheaper than I could find in stores, so I opted to order from Amazon. Installation was easy, and I was back up and shaving in no time."
3,Electric Razor Replacement Heads,I am disappointed with the lack of sharpness to the blades. Replacement was easy but the shaving result isn't a whole lot better than the old heads. In fact my travel electric razor cuts smoother than my home razor with new heads.
4,necesario para preservar la utilidad de la afeitadora,"muy buena calidad de las hojas de repuesto. se recomienda cambiar las hojas cada año, por lo cual resulta muy practico comprar este repuesto junto con la afeitadora."
2,Product Didn't Fit My Norelco Model Shaver As Promised,To whom it may concern:I haven't had any major problems with product misrepresentation on Amazon before now.I sent email feedback that the HQ8 replacement heads didn't fit my model razor.Fortunately I hadn't disposed of an older model Norelco Shaver and when I checked andthe HQ8 did fit it so I decided to keep the HQ8.The product description listed my model shaver as compatible but it wasn't.Understandably I was not pleased.
4,They do the job.,"I have used Norelco since 1965, and I started with the two blade Norelcos. These are pretty good blades and I suppose the theory of having two different size holes for different hairs makes sense, but it slows down the overall shave time. I currently use HQ55, HQ8, and HQ9 and the HQ9 are the fastest and closest and, of course, the most costly. Since the HQ8 and HQ9 are usable on any razor that is designed for either, I mix both on the same razor with 2 HQ8 blades and one HQ9. It saves a bit of money and I get the benefits of both.Watch for Christmas sales and coupons."
1,Will never need it,"I was about to buy one of these along with new batteries for my $100+ Norelco shaver. When I opened the shaver I found two AA nicad batteries inside. It is only 5 bucks for new ones, and $20 for the blades and good as new. Instead the shaver is in the garbage, while Norelco hopes I buy a new one. That's why they hard-soldered the batteries into place! Nicads! Are they f-ing nuts? I'll never buy another Norelco anything!I'll read the reviews on other products before buying and this won't be done to me again."
2,K eep I t S imple S....,"With hundreds of models, parts styles, colors and gender pre determined shaving machines one would thinkthat a powerful search ENGINE out there would help in finding replacement heads or cutters would be a snap !!!NOT !! there are so many styles, part numbers, combinations, registered Marks, Trade marks, colors, shapes, functions, names and the like that its an ocean of useless information thet the consumer gets thrown into. SIMPLIFY AND ORGANIZE YOUR DATABASES SOI THE CUSTOMERS, SPECIALLY MEN, CAN GET IN, PUNCH A FEW KEYSTROKES,SPEND MONEY AND GET HE TELL OUT.BUT NOOOO !!! My Norelco shaver is fairly new. one or two years at the most. yet it was a nightmare to find replacement heads for it. everyone else's models and codes are listed exept MINE !!! what the hell? You people want to sell and spend lotsa time and money ""thinking"" ( paradox) how to entice the customer to spend money, yet the truth is that as time goes by it gets extreemely complicated to SHOP!!!"
2,Inferior product,"As with the oringinal heads, they work great when new, but dull quickly and are too expensive to have to keep replacing. I probably will buy a differnt razor rather than continue to replace the heads for this one."
4,Works fine - needs instructions for installation,"There were no instructions for the installation. Found video which showed how to remove old heads and install new ones. Once installed, works great!"
1,Not good...,The new heads suck compared to the heads that were sent with the razor. They don't get nearly as close because they are a different style. It's also a lot of money to pay for one change-out of the heads. I am very unhappy with the purchase and haven't used that razor in a month - I have went back to the Schick Quatro.
3,replacement heads,The new heads work OK. I cannot tell much difference in the new and the old ones in the way it shaves.
5,Easy change,"I was afraid I would mess up and delayed the changeover , but when I started the change it turned out to be very easy (following the directions given)."
4,Good,It was a gift for my father who is using it for last year. He has asked for replacement heads that means he likes it and intend to use it further. I am sure he must be taking the routine cleaning care as well.
3,Not as much of an improvement as I'd expected,"After several years with the same blades, I saw in the mirror that I wasn't getting a decent shave. I bought these replacement blades hoping that would solve it. Well, it's better, but still doesn't look as good as I'd hoped for. I'm not expecting ""blade close"", but it isn't even as good as some of my other electric razors over the years. It's good enough for everyday, but for important occasions I'll be using a blade again."
3,They don't stay on!,I love the idea of using a scrubber brush rather than a sponge that gets stinky and germy quickly. But these brushes fall off with the slightest bit of pressure.
5,What more is there to say?,"We needed a replacement for our worn out head on our oxo. These were just the thing, and didnt need to go around looking to make sure they fit ours in any stores, since we already knew they did."
3,Surprisingly More Expensive on Amazon,"I replace the brush heads on my OXO squirting dish brush on the first of every month. As far as quality, I couldn't be more satisfied with the OXO brand. I, however, am disappointed with the current price of this item. I shop at Amazon for everything. Amazon usually has the best prices in addition to the fact that I don't have to leave the house. Unfortunately, this item is currently priced, on Amazon, at $12.56 AFTER shipping. I live right across the street from a Bed Bath & Beyond. I just recently purchased this same item for $3.99, BEFORE tax. Sorry Amazon, I buy just about everything from you, this however is one item I will replenish elsewhere."
1,Please Don't Waste Your Money,"Without a doubt this is one of the worst waste of my hard earned money that I have ever done. Even if you are able to balance this piece of junk enough to get on it, it tips over the second you move. I have had floats that cost a buck that is better than this. My problem is that I threw away the box and receipt thinking that surely for the amount of money this lounge cost it would be at least usable.I now have a worthless piece of blue foam.Please go out and buy 25 of the $10 floats and you will be much much happier."
1,worst album ever made,"pretty awful. I love dylan but not this and not World Gone Wrong. If you can possibly get through this cd once, you'll never want to again. The other reviewers have to be in a dream world."
1,Truth in packaging,"Bob Dylan alone with his guitar, harmonica, and a batch of moldy folk songs. Could have been good except that his voice is beginning to sound a lot like Jerry Lewis in ""The Nutty Professor."" Can't complain about that cover, though. Finally, an example of truth in packaging: the haircut on the cover photo is every bit as good as the music inside."
2,Let's Make an Indie Movie!,"I did not like this movie. To me it was like someone said ""You like Rushmore? Being John Malkovich? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Well, have we got a script for you!"" The problem is that the movie is painfully shallow, and fails to really invest the person watching in the film in any of the characters. Kind of cool to see April from Parks and Rec chatting with one of the guys from the League, but that's about it. All in all I'd say this one is a pass."
3,"Fun movie, but clearly low budget.","Some movies hide their limitations quite well, but Safety Not Guaranteed doesn't quite succeed there. Entire sequences are filmed in a fuzzy low-light camera, and some shots are filmed backwards then reversed to hide lack of stuntwork. But the performances are funny and sweet. Worth a watch."
2,not as good as I hoped,Movie was slow and not as humorous as we hoped. The ending left us disappointed. We don't regret renting it but we had high expectations for a good artsy film and this movie didn't live up to our expectations.
4,Good Times!,"It was cute and fun. Not terribly unpredictable, at least until the very end, but it was a lot of fun along the way. I love Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza."
4,Funky litle movie that kept us all guessing,I personally liked this movie a lot but the rest of the family felt left out to dry a bit too long. Parts were all well cast and believably acted. The pushy narsissist was a bit over the top.
2,Enjoyment not guaranteed,It didn't engage me at all. I thought maybe the age gap was the reason but my 20-something son did not like it either.
2,So So,"Didn't love this movie. It was interesting at times but ultimately, I found it slow moving and boring. No great."
3,Almost There,"This movie starts out strong and then it just starts to drag on and meander. It kept my interest, but just barely."
4,Fun quirky movie,The movie is funny and enjoyable and worth the watch. The main character essentially plays the same role she does on Parks and Rec. but it still a fun watch. Even my Dad who poo-poos most movies got a kick out of this one.
4,worth watching,"I really enjoyed this movie, more than I had expected to. The plot moves fast and at it's core it is a feel good movie. All I can say is if you're interested just go ahead and watch it."
5,Excellent !,"A great story line , very good acting turns into an excellent movie.That is all you need to know.Why is `Back To The Future` a blocbuster , and not this ?"
3,Stay with it... it's worth it,A very well written romantic tangle with an intriguing time travel mystery! I felt that it was an interesting choice of character focus in the beginning but it was well paid off in the end!
3,Fun Indie Show,"This is definitely an independent film, and those are not for everyone. But it is fresh in both plot and characterization, sometimes funny, sometimes weird and sometimes even touching. The film touches on more complex themes than a usual Hollywood show, and is more about those themes than about action. If you are in the mood, it's a good show to watch. FYI for Kristen Bell fans -- hers is a bit-part, less than 5 min; she is not the star."
4,Fun and entertaining,"Ending was ok, but otherwise it was really fun. I really liked all of the actors & they made it really funny"
4,"Quirky, heartwarming,and very funny","I'm writing this review several weeks after viewing this movie. I should have reviewed right away, becauseit is a funny and quirky film that is full many many little moments that are so entertaining. The characters are all so well developed, and the actors do justice to the roles. Hope and anticipation of something big out there that will change our world forever is a human condition especially prevalent in our youth, and this movie brings it all together in one big adventure. I loved this film."
3,46 reviews by Cast and Crew all 4 & 5's,"Let's be honest here the movie is okay to watch, a romantic comedy. But that's what it is nothing more, it is at least entertaining and does offer a look at life and how our priorities change as we get older. It has very little to do with actual time travel. I can only guess that all the 4 and 5's were written by cast, crew and their families."
4,Yes!,"What a little treat this movie was. It's a bit slow in parts, but I really liked it. Different and fun."
4,Quirk-tastic,"This was a great movie to stumble upon on Amazon Prime. Funny, sad, honest, and somewhat plausible (I was even ok with the ending) make this, for me, a great combination. From the Little Miss Sunshine team."
4,Must See,"Unexpectedly good movie, Wanders through relationships and inward soul searching of cast members. Cute, funny and ful of surprises. You will not be disappointed."
5,Unexpectedly brilliant.,My wife and I bought this thinking it would be a serviceable pizza night flick. By the end of the movie we were enthusiastically engrossed in the characters and their various plights.It's scifi drama... Mostly drama... But funny as hell. I'm a fan.
5,Cool movie!,"I love quirky weird stuff like this. Added bonus, it has heart. Sadly, I relate to these characters, so I was totally rooting for the nut with the time machine."
5,Quirky Indeed,"I came across the high reviews and thought why not. Agree with the general theme of quirkiness. Some good interaction and stories going on, an easy, worthwhile watch."
4,good CD,"mariah carey has beautifully written ballads and a great voice accompanied by great music and melodies. The classic hits Dreamlover, and especially Hero are on this set. Other highlights include without you, anytime you need a friend, music box and a couple uptempo dance jams. I wouldn't say it's Mariah's best CD even though it's her best selling ever, I think Daydream, Butterfly and Mimi are her best CD's, she stays true to the ballads and voice with only a touch of hip hop/r&b grooves."
3,Not much better than her last album,"Overall, I would say that this is a pretty good album. It has a catchy dance song or two, and some very touching ballads. Unfortunately, that makes for a lifeless combination on this album. The dance tracks lack the energy of mariah's previous hits like Emotions. The ballads don't have the emotional intensity of the very believable Can't Let Go. However, I will give this album kudos for keeping it short and flowing smoothly for the most part. Standout tracks are Dreamlover, Hero, Anytime You Need a Friend, Without You and my personal favorite ALL I've Ever Wanted. The rest of the songs are pretty blah, and I've Been Thinking About You should have been left out. It's the worst track on the album and stands out like a sore thumb."
1,What do they think are doing...,"I'm sorry but I am not going to hear any group that sings ""and Jesus is crying..."". What the hell do they know. How do they dare to say Jesus will cry when the ""doom trump""?????I listened to the feature song ""Closing Eyes"" but look no further when I heard those lyrics...I love the ebm, synth-pop, future pop, etc. genres and I am not being a religious extremist but can not bear to hear someone who is DIRECTLY ""attacking"" Jesuschrist."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"Warning*** Don't buy this product unless you are positive that you will be happy with it. The 60day full guarantee is a lie. Amazon gave me a very hard time returning this when my son was unhappy with the shave,and I was within the 60 days, and when they did agree, after numerous attempts through email, they deducted 20% and are only refunding me $84 out of the $109. I understand not getting back the shipping, but when they say satisfaction guaranteed, I expect the full purchase price back. This was a truly awful experience with Amazon."
4,More ethereal magic from HEM.,"I recently listened to the first HEM cd ""Rabbit Songs"" and realized they might have done more spendid recordings. After a search on Amazon, I found out they had several newer recordings. I purchase this one among the others. I believe it is their third complete CD. It carries on in the vein of the first two. There are 14 tracks here. Enough to keep your enjoyment of this band satisfied. I am addicted to the sound of Sally Ellyson's voice. It is deep and breathy, and fluid and melodic. She gets the tones right to your heart without the vocal acrobatics you hear when women audition for Amercan Idol. She will purr you into heaven. If you like previous Hem releases, don't hem and haw, just buy it, because it is good."
3,More country than Rabbit Songs,"As a big fan of Hem's Rabbit Songs, I was somewhat surprised at the more pronounced country stylings of Funnel Cloud. Whereas Rabbit Songs seemed to live somewhere between folk and moody pop with a few country-flavored instruments (pedal steel, banjo), parts of Funnel Cloud almost seem aimed at country radio. Still, there are enough highlights to make this a solid purchase for fans of the singer-songwriter genre as well as country music."
4,Delicious yet Nutritious. :o),"Wasn't sure what quite to expect... but both my husband and I enjoy these yummy fruit snacks. They are very much like, if you put some fruit into a hydrator...Fun, though. :o)"
4,A must for all little princesses,This is the perfect lamp for any little girl who loves princesses. My daughter got it for her 4th birthday. It is easy to use with a push button to turn the light on/off. The princesses dance and revolve and talk before the light turns off or on. The only bad thing is the volume is louder than you would want right before bed or if you wake in the middle of the night and turn it on. It could also use a night light feature. I had seen a different princess lamp w/the night light. It is also expensive but will last.
4,"""The Statesman's Handbook""","Niall Rudd's edition of Cicero's two works The Republic and The Laws is the ideal handbook for the aspiring statesman; the accomplished politician should also be referred to use these two dialogues as a sort of political guide to draw from. In these two texts, the reader will find Cicero in all his eloquence artfully dicating the principles of what it means to be a good man and what it takes to create and consolidate states. This book will leave a lasting impression upon anyone who pans through the pages of these two very important works of the great Marcus Tullius Cicero. Also found here are the always insightful explanatory notes contained in the excellent series of Oxford World Classics; and the concise, scholarly introductions will without a doubt throw significant light upon the principles addressed throughout these timeless texts."
5,Exactly what I needed!,The Republic and The Laws for Kindle was exactly what I needed while writing my Western Civ paper! No need to carry around texts... I had all I needed on my Kindle!
3,Porsche Boxster Manual,Considering the long wait for this manual to be available and the relatively high cost I expected more.
5,Exactly What I Ordered!,I ordered this as a gift for my mom. This product came in a timely manner and was packaged to perfection! Thanks again Amazon.com!!
2,Basic Guide,"This is a decent guide for people visiting the park for the first time, it hits the highlights but lacks the insight into the less well known and less visited places that i was hoping to find."
1,I wish I could've used it...,"I've used this rosin before (I've borrowed it from a friend) and I love it. It works. However, I was not pleased with how it was received ... The rosin was so broken up, it was unusable. I didn't expect this, considering how it seemed like it was well packed. Still, I strongly recommend that you do not buy it here; I certainly will never do that again. I guess there's a reason I've been patronizing my local music store until now..."
4,Solid rosin,Hadn't picked up the cello in years and this got the bow up to speed quickly. Applications are infrequent and the round design + cloth makes it easy to use.
5,Henderson rules!,"If you are thinking about why to buy this CD. You only have to know that it's better than Clapton's ""From the cradle"". Many of the tunes are sung. Here we have great guitar technique and also blues feeling. There aren`t bad songs. For those who have lost their faith in blues, this is fresh air."
2,"So well-meaning, so naive, so tiresome",The authors strain mightily to help out the reader in an admittedly confusing modern world. But their view is pre-modern; it never answers the real questions of living in the 21st century.
4,cat box liners,"I like this product. I would love it if they had elastic around them instead of a rubber band to hold them in place. But all in all they are nice. They do fit over almost any size cat box. We actually took a small rubber maid container (used for storage, shallow container) and use it as a litter box because we have a large cat that can not get into a small litter box....these liners fit that container as well. The only other down side to these would be that they aren't made for cats who have claws because it will tear and waste several liners at once."
5,Easy clean,"I really like these liners my cats are declawed and it works great ,a real time saver when you have two cats"
4,A good shaver but.....,"The shaver is great, but nothing and I mean nothing beats Panasonic's linear shavers. Well worth the extra money."
2,Good for technicians...as an engineer source: FATAL!,"If you are not a Communications Engineer, this book will take you throught some (very basic) theory. The book is TOO expensive for what it has to offer (to engineers). I don't recommended to any engineer, not anyway for such a steep price! . If you are a Technician, ok, it will do, but don't even think about doing some simple designs and use this book as your refence!."
4,Good Product for Computer Simulations,"I use this product on my Racing Cockpit frame / iRacing.com racing simulator. Simulates bumps in track, engine RPM, and anything else you can feel in a car.Pros: Quality of construction.Cons: on/off button is a little confusing to use."
4,An Interesting Collection,"A very interesting collection of stories , including some very rare material by Bram Stoker not to be found anywhere else i.e. the original theatrical play based on 'Dracula'. However I would recommend this as a follow up to the classic ""Mammoth Book of Vampire Stories"" in the same series which is an absolute MUST READ for any vampire fiction / horror fiction fan"
1,Little Havana Hygrometer Not Reliable,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago. The first one sent to me, the display on the hygrometer on the temperature side was not legible. Another one was sent as replacement, however, upon loading the new battery, the cover to it does not hold the battery in securely. This causes the temperature/humidity reading to turn on and off intermittently. This is a poorly designed/manufactured product and do not recommend this to anyone. Spend $29.99 and buy yourself a ""Xikar"" hygrometer which is Very Reliable...I was informed by Cigar Extras that unless I deleted the review mentioned above, I would NOT receive my refund of $17.99"
4,great for beginners,"i recommend this book to anyone who knows a few russian words, but not so much about the grammar. it is a small to the point book that covers the basics."
4,it works if taken consistantly,"the product works if taken consistantly.I have been taking it for over one year and am happy with it.I feel better - don't get so many ""lows"""
2,Looks great...but sounds terrible...,"speakers looked ok...but once plugged in, they make these crazy humming sound when turned up a little. has to be at minimum volume so you dont hear the annoying sound...problem is, sound quality and volume is bad, even when turned all the way up...i gave it 2 stars coz of the way it looked...i like the style and concept, hopefully the maker now focuses on the sound quality after all these reviews. and its not also all the way flat. i saw this news where they showed a speaker system that is completely flat. this speaker has a bump at the back."
1,Horrible,"Just horrible. Constant static, even if you're not using them at the moment. They were cheap in price, and now I know why. I will never buy from this brand again."
2,no pronounciations except at first pages,yeah which makes it for advanced students i would say..so not so usuable unless you already know how to say it right or if you only want to write it and not speak it very quikly unless after studying all the grammer
5,the best guitarist one of the greatest album,"What a sound, the introduction is incradible. Wow what a player. It's one of the best concert i've ever heard... There's the Live at The El mocambo which is better but thi album is a diamont ."
2,Way too confusing,"I have been doing aerobics for about 10 years and decided to give this workout a try. There is minimal instruction for a series of steps and arms moves that are very fast and unorganized. I spent most of my time jumping up and down trying to figure out what Petra was doing instead of getting a real workout. Furthermore the intensity is pretty minimal, so even if I were to learn the moves I don't think I'd get a great workout."
4,cc5858,"I recently ordered this video from amazon.com. I have to admit my head was spinning the first time I tried the workout, but it was much easier the second time. My advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this video is... get it, it's a good workout (it's a little short for my taste, but it does the job), but don't get discouraged the first time you do it, because it does get easier. The moves are a little dancey, and what's up with that Egyptian move? Honestly, it's a fun workout and I am glad I bought it."
5,My favorite Rob song of all time!,"Robbie cooperated with Pet Shop Boys in the song ""No Regrets,"" the second single from his IBEY album. I was extremely drawn by the song as soon as I heard it, for the rhythm and background vocals sounded really unique and it had a flavor of techno and world music. The lyrics were also brilliant, as Rob vividly depicted the anguish of losing someone or something very important.Although Rob writes all genres of music, this track really stands out from all of his compositions. I highly recommend this song.BTW, Antmusic is fine, if you like Rob singing rock."
5,Hope is the Anchor of the Soul,"I loved this book!! The struggle between the younger woman, Serena and the older woman, Gwen took many twists and turns. Each of them keeping secrets. Many families face these decisions of keeping sacred family trusts. You see yourself in Serena- strong and bold with no boundaries. And then again in Gwen- broken then reborn with a real lust for life again. You cry with Gwen as she tries to bring back some sense of reality to her mother. Carol St John is truly an inspiration to us all as a gifted artist and now writer of this inspiring novel. Her spirit shines through. A true Goddess!"
5,A true original! St. John keeps you guessing.,"A true original! Filled with powerful imagery, this novel takes you on a journey from the rocky shores of New England to the heart of Nicaragua and back again. It weaves seamlessly between the past and the present and between the thoughts and actions of two very different women who both love the same man and who begin an unusual sort of friendship when he disappears. This book has a fascinating plot with equally fascinating characters who grow and evolve as ""life happens"". St. John keeps you guessing up until the end."
2,Battery sucks!,After a little over a year the battery died on me. No way to recharge it. A good trimmer while it lasts. But 1 year of using it isn't much. And I used it only twice a month or so.My advice is to stay away from this thing.I am going for a Wahl next time!
1,Don't buy - battery problems,"My battery didn't last even as long as the others who commented - less than 6 months of proper use. Since then, won't hold a charge or work with the charger."
5,Best of the Best,This shaver works perfectly and quietly compare to any of the other five I have had. Would recommend to anyone.
4,Excellent but short life,"I have had this trimmer for over two years now, and use it about twice a month. I'm very happy with its features and durability. After two years though, the battery quickly stopped holding much of a charge then eventually became unchargable.That may be understandable of a nicad battery. The problem is they do not use standard batteries that you can easily replace. I did open the trimmer after some trouble, the batteries were soldered in, which I eventually removed. They looked like two AA's but I quickly found they are really four 1/2AA or 1/3AA, totalling 6V. I could not find replacements in several electronics catalogs, their 1/2AAs are too long and 1/3's too small.Anyway I now have to use it with the power cord, which is not that big of a problem, but for the price I was expecting something that would last much longer, so just be aware of that."
3,Battery died,I bought this trimmer in 2003 and was using once a week to trim beard and scalp hair as well.Worked fine for three years and then battery stopped charging and trying to use it with cord it ran vey slowly and did not trim hair.Batteries are not consumer replacable and the money you have to pay to replace batteries by service center you can buy a new trimmer and throw this away.Although newer mdels have added features like vaccum chamber to collect hair they do not come with dual voltage like 990 and to use them during overseas travel you have to carry additional 220 volt transformer.I have looked at T970 and T780 they work on 120 volts only.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE T990!,"I received this unit as a gift a few months ago, and have used it lightly, though regularly. It worked well after the initial charge. However, it will not recharge after the initial charge (indicator doesn't even come on).I have had to replace this unit TWICE due to this manufacturing defect.As expected, this most recent unit has also stopped working, and I am now stuck with a dead trimmer. Looks like I will be visiting the warranty center for my THIRD trimmer.I can assure you this is not user error, as I have read identical complaints elsewhere."
3,A VERY BRIEF Self-Help Book for the Religious,"The main idea of this book is the need and means to be the master of ownself. It explains how Man can be his own friend and foe, the need to discipline and control body and mind, conquest of our lower nature (fear, jealousy, hatred, ignorance, greed, lust, etc.), conserve engergies, and lastly, explains what he means by ""self-help"" and ""self-surrender""; the latter which he refers as ""surrendering oneself to God"".This is a small book with only 84 pages, which one can finish reading easily within a couple of hours. It may not be suitable for all as it uses a ""religious"" tone, referring to words of Buddha, Christ, etc. and the word ""God"" appears here and there. Atheists may feel completely (upset) by it.... for others, it may be acceptable but there are better books (which stress the need and teach us how to be Master of Self) out there than this one."
4,Probably the best headphones under $100 for airline travel,"I bought and tried several higher-priced, name-brand competitors headphones to hear which ones actually cancelled out background noise. If you buy, try and compare you have a better chance of getting what you expect. The others that I tried had NO DISCERNABLE noise cancellation and/or, did not have sufficient volume for use within an airplane cabin. While this one lacks an auto-off switch, which can save batteries, and has no remote volume control, it works great at noise cancellation. I wouldn't argue that it has audiophile fidelity, but if you want to watch a movie on your computer, this makes it possible."
1,Wasted Money,"This razor is a piece of junk. Norelco can't seem to master power management. First charge, per instructions, created 100 minutes of power on the readout. After just 15 shaves, 66 minutes showed on readout when the unit discharged itself and left me with no power to shave with. Second charge produced 100 minutes of power on the readout but upon powering it up, it immediately dischaged again. Then, trying to shave with it plugged in caused it to automatically shut off every 10 seconds. In addition, when flipping open the head assembly for cleaning, is popped completely off the unit and onto the floor. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,Smooth Shaving with the Norelco 8894XL,"The Spectra 8894XL gives me a good close shave. I like the long time span between battery recharges i.e. 100 minutes or a month's worth of shaves, and the rinse clean up is easy. It comes with a fancy stand for recharging and storing the razor, which I think is unnecessary. They could easily omit it and charge a few dollars less. The list price seems high, so look for sales."
3,High price for a slow shaver,"It is fancy and top of the line Norelco shaver, with polymer display and lithium battery. It charges extremly fast and last 100 mintues. But for a $150 or more shaver, it shaves very slow. I don't have a lot of facial hair, but it took a long time and repeated shave for a clean shave which I would got for half of the time with my old norleco shaver or a braun shaver. Also, it doesn't store the hair, tends to leak out while you are shaving, so be aware. The nice thing is you can rainse it under water.I think I probably would try someother brand for my next shaver."
4,One of the best new metal bands from Germany,Sculpture are one of the biggest surprises in 1998: songs on this album are melodic but still fresh and heavy.
1,Why would you buy this set when individual seasons are cheaper to buy separately?,"I loved the Muppets Show. It IS a trip back in time. Enjoyable, clean, simple fun with amazingly incredible entertainers behind the each muppet and as guest stars.But why would you buy this three DVD set for over $120 when you can by the 3 DVDs separately for under $75? $50 for a box to hold the three? LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL Someone's being had!!!!!"
2,Where are they?!!!,"I agree with another reviewer...this was my fault as well. I did not read the size of this set under the description. That being said, are you kidding me? This whole ""box"" is smaller than a mint tin. Yes, for sure a choking hazard. My children would not put these in their mouth, but I am not sure what they would do with them other than squirrel them away with other tiny, tiny things. I ordered them because they love to play with their tea set. I was hoping to add onto this playtime ritual. The main description of this item really needs to include that they are MINIATURE. I an sorry. Despite the quality, I cannot keep these."
1,Don't bother.,"I don't review many books but this one was so bad, I had to. Rhy is a manipulative, controlling monster. Sallie should not have moved in, she should have got a restraining order! This is not a romance, it's a biography of a bad relationship from start to finish. That it was written in the 80's is irelevant. The ""hero"" is not supposed to treat the heroine like dirt."
1,don't waste your time or money -- it's unreadable,"This book was virtually unreadable. As I attempted to work my way through it (yes, ""work""), all I kept thinking was why in the world ""Sally"" would even want to be with ""Rhy"". His only attractive feature, his physical appearance, was grossly outweighed by his repulsive tendencies to control and abuse. The author's overuse of superlatives in describing the personality and actions both main characters was mostly unbelieveable and sometimes laughable. Linda Howard has produced several wonderful books (""Son of the Morning"", ""Shades of Twilight"", ""Dream Man"", ""Lady of the West"") and I look forward to more new works that reflect her considerable talent. This is a greatly disappointing book from an author capable of so much better."
1,Don't buy this book,"This just goes to show, Do not buy a book before you read these online reviews. Wish I did; I could have bought a Linda Howard book - updated to current times - that I truly enjoyed."
1,Old fashioned abuse,"Gosh, I love LH. But this book has served its purpose of getting one's first works published. Attitudes towards women have changed a lot in the past decades it seems. And while this book may once have been considered romantic, it doesn't withstand the test of time. Now it is just annoying. Rhys ignored anything Sally wanted, going to all lengths to destroy her career and her self esteem. Jeez the guy is a stalker- and we have laws and lawyers to protect women these days. I agree with the other suggestion- throw this book across the room -and then go buy any of many other wonderful LH books."
2,Now I Know I'm Not Alone!,"I love Linda Howard's books. I've kept every copy of one I've come across - even this one completely despite myself because it's awful! Rhy is a stalker - and Sallie's mad to go anyhwere near him unarmed. The most positive thing I can think to say about this one is that clearly Ms Howard was practicing with variations of alpha male characters, and from the stone age Rhy's clearly living in, the wonderful Black Niall, Gray Roulliard and John Medina have evolved.I know it was the 80's, but this became seriously painful to read. It needs a disclaimer like the ones Sandra Brown includes on her reissues of early works - something like ""this book was written in a time when it was considered romanatic for men to harass women into exhaustion, admit having married them only because they felt sorry for the poor dears, bully them into leaving the work they enjoy, and stay at home where they belong - but only once the man figures out that's where he'd like to be too"""
2,"Not one of her best books, but not the worst!","This is obviously an early Linda Howard! She has become a much better author since this was first published. While I did not think this book was as bad as ""All That Glitters,"" Ms. Howard should have had a talk with her publishers before allowing these books to be reprinted without updating! She is capable of so much more!"
2,Information overload,Explains one aproach then rejects it in favor of another then yet another. By the end you discover that you should have bought a book on Jakarta Struts if you want to develop real JSP sites because someone has already done lots of work for you.
1,really bad product - stopped working within 6 weeks,I bought this trimmer and it seemd like a pretty good product for the first month or so. After that the product just seemed to die. The battery would not charge; and even when plugged in it would only work for about 2 seconds and just die off.I would not recommend it unless you are ready to return it after about a month of use.
2,Weightless,"Much like a track on the CD, the best way I can describe this collection of songs is Weightless. I cannot understand the glowing reviews of this CD--unless they are written by friends and family of the singer--but every track sounds alike. Each song has the same airy-fairy whispery vocals, set to an astoundingly similar musical accompaniment. When the singer does, indeed, break away from her breathless, whispery vocals (which is not often), she often is off-key or flat in her pitch. That may explain the breathy, soft, whispery quality of her vocals--her best delivery. The tracks are unimaginable in arrangements, altho some of the lyrics are well thought. But on the whole, a disappointment to me, personally, and not at all what I had expected based on glowing reviews. I found the CD to be a bore--maybe something one might play for background music whilst receiving a massage or a facial."
4,Good to have her back,"If I were to introduce someone to Sissel, the best analogy I could think of is probably Charlotte Church - a little bit of classical/traditional, an early debut, and so on... and you can guess from the introduction that she might have some difficulty leaving those behind, and try to give us a different image.I imagine it might be very hard finding the right materials for Sissel, so that she doesn't sound too detached from the pop world, but still get to showcase her best qualities. For me some of the lyrics are too simple to be involving, and some of the songs could be stronger, just because Sissel's voice deserves better.My favorite song here, by far, is ""where the lost ones go"". The intensity of the emotion sends a chill down my spine every time. The album overall is still worth the wait - perhaps I was expecting the impossible :o)"
3,Screamo no Singo,"Seems they rely to heavily on the screaming, perhaps to be more ""hardcore"". I would prefer more actual singing/vocals. Some of the songs are entirely screaming with no singing. Overall not bad though."
3,A little drag...,"My daughter needed a wheeled backpack to carry loads of books and supplies on a daily basis. In less than a week, the straps of this backpack were frayed from where it was being pulled despite them being as tight as they would go. The ends also get caught in the wheels and get tangled up. It's a lot of money not to be perfect. The color pink is also not a wise choice for a wheeled backpack. It looks horrible after just a few uses. Keep shopping unless you have very little that needs to be pulled around."
1,"Overpriced, Poor Quality","I bought this backpack for my 10 year son and gave it to him at Christmas 2007 - He used it from January until February 22, 2008 - The bottom has been completely shredded. He told me that it kept tipping over and he had to drag it. He could not pull it on the wheels. It is a waste of money. This product is not made to be used by children who have to haul alot of books home on a daily basis. Do not waste your money on this one!"
2,play time of only 31 minutes and expensive,"I bought the following CDs:1. Multiplication unplugged, $11.99, 73 minutes play timeOut of these 3 CDs, this one is, by far, the best quality and value. 5 stars.2. Multiplication Intelli-tunes by Ron Brown.$14.99, 28 minutes - 2 stars3. Multiplication Hip Hop $13.99, 31 minutes - 1.5 stars"
3,tunes not very catchy,"This CD is pretty good but far from great. These rap tunes are not very catchy .. the only song we can really remember is the one for the '3s'. Overall I think it has helped my daughter though.One good thing is that every song goes over the multiplication table twice.When I looked for a multiplication table CD, it looked like none of them was very good ... so this my be the best out there."
2,Hip Hop Flop,"Uggggh. This CD is annoying, even to the 3rd graders in the crowd. The students actually moaned the second time they heard it. Save your money and avoid this one."
4,Great CD for kids practicing multiplication,My students loved this CD and cannot wait to be in the listening center with the CD!
3,"Great, when you finally get it to play...","This is my second Jennifer Kries Pilates video. She's an obvious expert in her field. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is difficult to get it to play on my computer, sometimes taking 5-10 minutes of trying to make the menu choice actually play the video. I don't seem to have that problem with other videos. Not sure what the problem is."
1,"I know its cheap but, REALLY???","This gravity tube arrived in pieces. Luckily I am pretty handy with a glue gun- not worth the hassle. Hopefully when the second one gets here that I ordered the same day, it will be functionable!UPDATE: The second gravity tube- crushed! Don't waste your time!"
1,Mission critical failure,"I finally gave up on this dual wan router. Our use is mission critical. Whenever this router would lock up and cease to function, I would have to travel to our office all hours of the night or weekend to power cycle it to resume service. I installed every firmware upgrade for the past nine months, with hope that this time the freeze ups would be fixed. I could no longer tolerate the poor service. I have replaced this router with a single WAN port Dlink (I had to give up using the dual WAN months ago because of poor reliability), and not only does the Dlink NOT lockup every couple days, but the network speed and response time increased! I had been blaming my cable provider for the poor Internet speed, but it was this Netgear router all along. Do not purchase this router unless you want to constantly deal with the headaches that it gives."
1,A terrible book and a betrayal of trust,"I missed meeting Robin Moore by a few hours at K2 and I am glad that I did. This book is an embarrassment to SF and betrayal of the trust that SF has placed in Mr. Moore. Most all of the people mentioned by name in the book had asked and been promised by Mr. Moore to mention them by first name only and not to use their photos. This promise was broken.The Rah Rah comic book style of the writing is an insult to the professionalism of the Special Operations Community. If you want to know why Robin Moores new book is nothing more that a paste up of news clippings, his unprofessional actions in writing this book is your answer."
3,Good review of SOF in Afghanistan,"This book was a good read about the behind the scenes activites that occured during Operation Enduring Freedom. The author is openly biased against all other US military forces which was a disappointment. The author seems to put the Green Berets on a pedestal where they did and could never do any wrong. That is the major drawback in this book. The author could have been more objective in that regard, but I still enjoyed it. It gives a very good glimpse of the special operations and tactics used in conjunction with the Northern Alliance forces."
2,A great story lost,After reading the book I must say I am disappointed. Mr. Moore wrote about true hero's only to have them colored by a soldier of fortune and mercenary named Keith Idema. This is an example of how to pillage a great story.
1,What is a truth?,I do not believe Moore is telling the full truth about what really happening in Afghanistan during US war against Taliban. I am skeptical that he is telling us the truth. I understand the need to protect classified activities. But the most important thing is what is a truth?1. I do not care about how many soldiers are there.2. I do not care about how many people are live in Afghanistan.3. I do not care about oil.4. I do not care about what languages that Afghans speak.5. I do not care about US government's reasons for war in Afghanistan.6. I do not care how many wars have we learned from the lessons.7. I do not care what do you think about this book.8. One thing that I care is truth.Most people does not know what is truth. I know what is a truth. I can define truth. But I am not telling you what does truth mean. Most people does not know how to telling the truth.TRUTH IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON.
1,Sad Times We Live In,"I read an Associated Press article today that Jack Idema has been pardoned by Afghanistan's President Karzai; they don't seem to want this loser either.This book is trash. It was basically written by ""Jack"" Idema, who is trash and it is an embarassment to the Special Operations community that this clown was ever part of it.For those of you that believed this drivel, it is sad times we live in...This book needs to be the first to be awarded negative stars."
3,Not a great read.,"Yes ,her father was certainly wrong. However he did have a drug + alcohol problem and did apologize. That isn't enough for Jessica, as she seems to want to blame him for every mistake she's made in her life. I found her very self-righteous and determined to get the last word.Her attempts for revenge just don't seem as noble as she would like."
2,Like Pushing a Brick,"Everything about this vacuum appears beautifully designed and built, until you try to push it across a carpet. Nearly every full size upright vacuum I've ever seen has four wheels to make it easy to push across a rug. This one on the other hand has two wheels in the back and the front of the vacuum just sits on the floor. Still not too bad until you turn it on and that terrific suction adheres the front of the vacuum to the carpet. It did a great job cleaning, but my arm was sore after doing half a room. There is no way that I could vacuum a whole house using this thing. We have dense pile carpet; perhaps there is less drag on a Berber or loop type carpet. It's a real shame, because I love the looks, quality of construction, and design of the hose and attachments, but bottom line: if I can't push it across the floor, all the great features in the world aren't going to make it an acceptable product."
2,Disappointing-the topic deserves a broader viewpoint,"I enjoy most Country Living books and Irish Country was an intriguing topic. This treatment unfortunately is a very shallow look at a very limited amount of examples of pottery, fabric, and furniture. Many of the items are obscure and one doesn't get a real feel for the richness of the topics. Its not really a decorating book either - its focus is substantially on replicating the look of some of the material (pottery, fabrics, etc) through do-it-yourself crafts. For example, I didn't learn anything about the variety of Irish furniture and how to decorate with it. Hate to be so negative but I felt like the title and book cover were false advertising."
5,Night Shadow,Knight is a great character. I like the way he was introduced in the first book. It made you want to know more about him.
3,Just Wanted One Song,"And that song is The Jean DuShon Second Class Lover! I love this song and constantly played it on YouTube! The Major Lance, Walter Jackson and Billy Butler tunes I've had for years. I also like Cool Breeze by Gerald Sims, that was nice as well. GOT to have my Chicago Soul! I already have volume 1 so now I have volume 2."
2,Superficial view of a major figure,"Here is an ""homage"" to--and not really a biography nor a critical appraisal of--a major figure in Twentieth-Century music. The book is far too short to do justice to its subject, but that resulted from the fact that the author had his troubles. After initially welcoming him, on Yehudi Menuhin's urging, Boulanger later became uncooperative, leaving the unfortunate author to consult mostly already-published sources instead of her own then-extensive archives. He did not really have access to her closest associates either, after his initial contact with Boulanger herself. Given those severe restrictions, the author has, in fact, perhaps done better than might otherwise have been expected with his subject. I particularly recommend his excerpts from Boulanger's published music criticism."
3,SCOTT SONNON'S OFFICIAL KETTLEBELL FOUNDATION,"GOOD SERIES BUT THE SOUND DROPS FROM HIGH IN THE INTRO TO ""I CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING"" VOLUME. MR SONNON HAS THIS PROBLEM IN HIS ""CLUBBELL DVD"" AS WELL. OUTSIDE OF THAT THE INSTRUCTION IS GOOD. CHECK OUT ""KETTLEBELL SYSTEMA"". IT'S MORE ""ABC"" LIKE. PLEASE BRING BACK THE ""ORIGINAL"" GRAPPLER'S TOOLBOX IN DVD !!!!"
2,Black & Decker DirtBuster: filters,"Satisfaction with this product is quite good, until it comes to the problem of locating the filters that fit in the dust bin. I have tried all locations: Home Depot, Ace Hardware, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond. None of them carry the filter, only the vac. Even the Black & Decker website offers no help. Can anyone tell me where to purchase the oblong filter encase in plastic? Help!!"
2,Take the Rose Colored Glasses off,"Everything said about the excellent quality sound and picture quality is correct. Everything said about this being Elvis at his best is not. This is his worst performance at a time when he could have consolidated and increased his fan base substantially, given the exposure this special received.The closest we get to getting the ""real"" Elvis is in his performance of Fever. I'll Remember you is excellent.In reference to the few of his earlier hits, Elvis clearly gives his fans ""the finger"" - that is, "" I really don't want to be singing this stuff"".The cameras move more than he does (if he moves at all). Elvis seems content to just sleepwalk through the whole show, and given this historic performance, this is tragic.I've been a fan sinceI was about 5 years old, so of course I have bought the DVD. But, from an Elvis performace perspective, the show was a dud. Even the 1977 CBS TV special had more energy than this."
3,"Elvis "" Aloha from Hawaii""","I was very satisfied with the concert part of it. But the last four songs(post-concert ""insert"" songs) done in front of a projection screen was dissatisfying. No back ground scene like the original VHS with the background scene."
4,Hawaii,"We enjoyed watching this show to see one of Elvis' best performances. We have recently rediscovered Elvis and thought it was a heartfelt understanding of him as a person. This DVD is organized pretty well...and if someone wants a single DVD of Elvis on stage, this is the one to buy."
2,"Good playing, bad piano","Too bad... some stylish and tasteful playing here is badly marred by a really ugly-sounding piano. Why an obviously intelligent artist would record on such a piece of garbage is a mystery to me. The piano sounds harsh and steely, quite the opposite of the lovely Pleyels Chopin is known to have preferred.If one could get past the ugly piano, Tsong's playing would rank near a 4-star.I'll wait for Pires or Abbey Simon to record the Mazurkas, then I'll get rid of this set."
4,Pretty Good,"While the soundtrack is both fun sounding and relates to the movie, I would only download the really standout tracks. The Carwash Song was pretty good. It was also kind of funny to hear ""Lies and Rumors"" by D12, listening to thier album ""D12 World"", it seems they wouldn't have anything to do with this type of a movie soundtrack. There are also good songs by Will Smith, Jojo, Avant, and Sean Paul & Ziggy Marley"
2,It don't work,"On the third day, the right side just quit. Left side still works. The sound quality is nice, but the right side just decided to stop working."
3,So-so...,"The title may say professional DJ headphones but they are mid level at best. The range on these isn't very good but for the price they are just okay. You want a pair of good headphones for under $100 buy the Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil, these things really perform...which is what I replaced this set with."
5,Wow,"""Beautiful Boy"" is an extraordinarily powerful film, thanks to two extremely strong performances by Maria Bello and Michael Sheen as the parents of a young man who is responsible for shooting others and himself at his college. Though the story could have veered off into the politics of how and why, it takes a far more personal approach, showing us the effect on the shooter's parents--on them as individuals and as a couple. The result is a deeply personal and deeply moving story that seems completely real. I highly recommend this film."
4,Tears,"""Beautiful Boy"" with Maria Bello, and Michael Sheen; is a tear jerking movie. I am not sure where to begin, but this was a true Hollywood story. It is well worth renting.I recommend watching this film."
3,Expensive,"The colors are vivid and bright, and look beautiful on papers of all colors. This pack has lots of great qualities about it, but why go on and on about it? I'll skip right to the downside.Amazon has this priced way too high. Why not sign up for costco, and get this item for LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE of what amazon's price is?"
1,Poor battery life,"I bought one of these to use occasionally at my cabin. Since I am not there all that often, it sits on its charger - charging most of the time. Despite this, it never ran for more than 1 minute. It has very, very poor battery life and power. Like previous reviewers I agree that this name brand product is junk"
1,lvbgal - please don't read more about me,This hand held cordless vac is useless. I am throwing it in the garbage. It will not pick up any dirt. Mine has been used just a few times and it is useless.
3,Its ok,"The movie wasnt what i expected. I thought cause it said i heart minnie, it would be mainly about her. Just one episode is about her. But since its mickey mouse clubhouse, my daughter watches it so its not a waste of money."
4,Solid construction,"Solid construction with very clear markings. I bought this to setup the action on my guitar and needed 64th markings.For guitar though, I finally preferred items from stewmac.com, especially their string action gauge."
5,Wonderful coffee,This coffee maker really surprised me with its excellent quality and taste. Easy to set up for 2 quick cups of coffee. Really glad I purchased this before they were gone.
2,"Should be a 2.5 rating, but that isn't an option","The main complaint about these earrings is that they are heavy. I can't keep them in my ears for a long period of time without them hurting. The other problem is they were smaller then I expected, I didn't expect them to be huge but I also didn't expect them to be as small as they were. Other than that, they are a cute pair of earring and different from the standard hoops that we normally see.So, if your used to wearing heavy earrings these might not bother you. However if you tend to wear light earrings or only wear them every once in a while,like I do,I would suggest not getting these."
1,I thought I was buying a vacuum?,"I don't get it - this vacuum picks up almost no dirt on carpet or tile floors, yet it manages to destroy any rug it's used on. This product sucks in every way other than the way it's supposed to."
1,I gave it many chances.. but it has to go,At first I thought this vacuum kept clogging because I was living in a place with new carpet. Now I'm in a place that doesn't have a carpet shedding problem and the clogging is as bad as ever (even after time consuming clearing of the system every time I use it). I hate to throw things out - especially since the motor still runs well - but this has to go.
3,Insipid,"Sorry, but I can't hear the instruments. I tried twirling the volume way up to listen to the string work,then abruptly down to avoid some building crescendo, but of course this isn't practical. Beyond theacoustics, the presentation seems bland and tentative to me. For one penny plus shipping I ordered acopy of Bratislava Symphony Orchestra under Ondrej Leonard, released by Classical Gallery. This is aHarold more to my taste: vivid and above all audible, with excellent presence and definition."
1,Direct-to-video cheap thrills!,"When I saw the front box of this movie, I thought, Gee, this looks like that it might be a well budgeted, frightening movie with good effects! Don't let the front box fool you. Instead we have a Z-grade hokey, badly acted comedy-horror film. You may want to see it for B-movie scream queen Linnea Quigley(Her first appearance in the film is in a nude shower scene), and some cameos and special guest appearances by some other stars such as John Carradine and another B-movie scream queen in Quigley's range Brinke Stevens."
1,the worst EVER,"there is absolutely no entertainment value in this movie.don't look at the cover and say ""oh , cool, this will be alright""......no it won't.this movie is so bad it's BAD.you've been warned.and no, there isn't even a moment or two worth remembering either for you ""half-movie"" likers.this movie makes leprechaun look like psycho. no, that wasn't insulting enough but it will do."
5,Songs that penetrate and don't let go,"This was my first Leonard Cohen album and still my favorite. With intelligent lyrics, simple yet intoxicating melodies, and an underlying sensuality, every one of these songs will seep into your conciousness and never leave. From the subtle groove of ""Waiting for the Miracle,"" the infectious ""Closing Time,"" the thought-provoking ""Democracy,"" to the simple beauty of the instrumental ""Tacoma Trailer,"" Cohen takes the listener on a magical journey that you will want to take again and again."
2,Maybe add a half-star for better times in the past...,"I only liked ""Closing Time"" and ""Anthem"" on this CD, and even those are a cut below Leonard's best work. This release gave me the feeling it was made of tracks that were not good enough for earlier albums, and someone decided to put them all one disc and get rid of them. The biggest insult to his fans, however, is to try to cover Irving Berlin's ""Always."" Both Cohen and Berlin are great songwriters, separated by a generation and a World War and amazing changes in love and courtship and sex customs. Leonard is great at writing relationship lyrics, and so was Irving, but for different planets. Try ""Various Positions"" and his ""Greatest Hits"" albums instead of ""The Future."" This one is just not in the top ranks of his concept releases."
2,Was he joking?,"Although this album definitely has some strong tracks, overall it was a big letdown. Cohen somehow goes was overboard into his own style, and it feels like he is doing a parody of himself. While many of his previous albums are very haunting and engaging, this one just leaves me feeling embarrassed for him.Really, I'm shocked to see all these other great reviews."
4,Pokeball watch for my[....]son,My son is very into Pokemon right now so I ordered this watch and he was very surprised to receive it as we've seen nothing like it in the stores. He likes it very much and wore it for a week straight.
4,Very good,The book was in excellent condition and arrived promptly. Very good study tool for school work. Just like the one they use at school. No more heavy lugging home in book bag each night.
4,This should not come as a surprise,"I am sure if you glance at the rest of the reviews you will be more than tempted to buy this book. Well, you should! Kerman's way of introducing the LOGIC behind actionScript is phenomenal. This books should help pave the way for you to grasp the logic behind actionScript. Why not 5 stars then? Well, I thought there would be more practical examples than the book included. Definitely worth the money!"
5,Her Critically Acclaimed Album!!,"Patty is one of the leading ladies in country and rightly so!This album really started things off for her.With her big hits You Will,Blame It On Your Heart and the beautiful ballad How Can I Help You Say Goodbye,this will leave a lump in your throat!There's also some great songs like Nothin' But The Wheel,Mr.Man In The Moon and You Don't Know How Lucky You Are-(very true lyrics)Patty has such an amazing country voice that you can't help but fall in love with.This is a must to any country collection..."
4,"Riopelle's ""Hush Money"" will have people talking.........","Anyone who remembers Jerry Riopelle's early success in the 70's (""Walkin on Water"") has been asking......WHERE'S JERRY? Well, after a long hiatus, ""Hush Money"" is a credible return of an outstanding singer/songwriter who has been sorely missed. The sound is....well, yes, more mature.....but haven't we all grown up a bit since singing along with Jerry at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix (the placed he ""owned"" oh those many years ago). Fine guitar work, meaningful lyrics and Jerry's unique voice will bring back great memories for his fans.....and perhaps find him some new ones. It doesn't appear that his early works have been released on CD.....with some modest success for ""Hush Money"", perhaps we'll get lucky.........."
5,"Great Color, Great Name!","CD Projest is a great name for CD cases. I really love this case because of the color and becasue of how it has this ""bubblelike paper"" that your CD is on, so there is less of a chance that it will get scarthed or ruined. Also, when you put CD's on both sides of it, you do not have to stuff in the back side because there is already a disc in the front side!"
5,Must have diet book....,"This is the diet program for me. The book is written in a quick, breezy style that makes it easy to read and follow. The authors make a lot of sense and I can see how this really works. They understand me. I'm already losing weight and and this is the best I've ever done! Highly recommended..."
3,magnesium stearate! really?,"I strive to use pure supplements, thus capsules are preferable to tablets since no binders are required. This product states that no tablet binders, coatings, etc. are contained. That had me feeling pretty good about it, but further down under ingredients it lists magnesium stearate, which is an exipient used as a flow agent. Great value, but I sure wish they would leave out the magnesium stearate."
4,Quite Interesting,"Despite the somewhat boring-sounding title, this book is in fact a good general ethnography of the southernmost native ethnic group in Halmahera (in North Maluku). Many aspects of their culture and history are dealt with, with interesting regional maps and tales of the author's travels there thrown in for added interest.It is the kind of book that should be available about other ethnic groups, too!The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is mainly intersting for those with a somewhat specialized interest in the culture and history of South Halmahera."
5,A thoughtful look through the eyes of a nine-year-old,"This book is such a provocative, sobering, thoughtful, and well-written look at abandonment and adoption from the perspective of a nine-year-old girl. The prologue really gave this newly-adoptive mother something to think about, and the story even more. I've read the story several times and think of it often as I consider my daughter and her experience and how we'll give her the space, support and love she needs to integrate her journey into her life here. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone adopting a child of any age."
5,Refreshingly different,This is a great CD. Shelley King and her talented band provide a great mix of music an lyrics.
1,Too Many Vocals,"Terrible, there are far too many vocal selections. I listen to Jazz in the quiet times, but this CD does not fit into that category. If this CD contained Jazz vocals, this would be fine. But this CD may as well be a Pop CD. Hate it, hate it, hate it."
3,Good vacuum,"Had this vacuum for over a year and it has been flawless. It cleans really well and leaves the carpet nice and fluffed up afterwards. It is also fairly quiet and make an expensive sounding turbine noise (its got a Turbo right :-) The extenable hose is pretty cool and easily retracts back into its self when you're done. It has two motors - one for the suction and one for the agitator. The agitator can be shut off with switch on the handle for hard floors. Also, there is no belt to replace, and the HEPA filter is a lifetime filter. Bag replacement is easy because the chamber comes right off the machine so you can take it outside to change the bag.Overall it works great."
4,It has most on the songs I wanted,"I've wanting to buy this CD for a long time and finally did it. It has most of the songs that I like from Hillsong, but has a lot that sound practically the same. This is a live album that is fresh and has a lot of rock sounds, is a good way to attract teenagers to the word of God. Is an album to praise the Lord, more than to worship him, except to great songs that are included."
1,as there is only one good song,"""As I lay me down"" is the only good song off of this album. I've listened to this album many times, but none of the other songs make me want to listen to them over and over for pleasure. The other songs don't seem to fit with ""as i lay me down."""
5,BEST ALBUM EVER!,"This is MY FAVORITE CD EVER! Buy it today!Sophie is a talented and beautiful singer. She jam packs hit after hit in this album, IT IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE BY ANYONE!"
4,Certainly worth buying,"I have had this disc for about two years and still think it's pretty good, although I am not as enthusiastic as some of the people who wrote reviews here. ""As I Lay Me Down"" is certainly an excellent song. There are other good songs too, but some of them become a little tiring after some time. All in all it's a very good disc, and it's somewhat a shame that Sophie hasn't produced anything since."
5,Whaler,"This is an excellent CD to have in your collection by Sophie B. Hawkins if your a fan of her style of music,it sounds great all the songs are really cool also"
4,Not to Bad Little Better than Average,This is more laid back not as aggresive as there first(For Madmen Only). I would recommend this album after there first one out of the four they have released.
3,Not consistent packaging!,"I bought 2 of these sets for a school project (don't ask), but one came with a horse (5 animals), and the other came with only the 4 animals shown. What gives??For people buying these for their intended purpose, I'd say they're good for young kids (or young-at-heart adults?). Colorful, squeezable, durable... I don't know if they actually squirt water. One kid was gnawing on one, and it held up, so that's good, right? (Can you tell I don't have kids?)."
3,Scraping From The Surface,"The introspective scribblings of someone who decided to put pen to paper. Perhaps thoughts to word processor is more accurate today. There are some ""true-isms"" here of things on the surface, but don't expect to get too deep here. Yes, April is a hot month in Thailand. Noting the difference in the way Thai and Taiwanese eat noodles is an obvious observation, but a point worth mentioning. Hey, we're being ""lite"" here. I like the description of living in Saudi Arabia. Lot of true-isms there. I learned how to tell if the chef is good or not in a Chinese restaurant by how fast he can chop with a knife. He also shared his married life perceptions and experiences. Tons of ""true-isms"" there. It's an OK read on a Bangkok bus. Although Tsow doesn't want to anyway, he should not quit his day job. Credit to Tsow for writing things down."
4,Fun book to read,"Though you need to have some knowledge about Thailand(and its language) in order to understand some of his jokes, I think this book is hilarious. It has a lot of incites into a bunch of countries, esp. that Bangkok is not a golden city but a traffic jammed nasty place with loads of fun :)It does, however, contain some stereotypes of Thai people being fun-fun, stupid people(though I have to admit the government is exactly like the committee in Edenburi), in which many Thais would argue there.But in general, I think it's a pretty good book to read when you have some free time, and one that shows some reality other than a bunch of mis-guilding Thai Guildbook as well."
4,Too big for a 2 1/2 y/o,I bought this smock because it says that it fits a 2 y/o kid. But it is too big for my 2 1/2 y/o DD. I need to use a clip at the back of the smock to make it high enough so it can really protect my DD's shirt.
4,most requested new baby book,"This is a picture book only...it allows the ""reader"" to tell the little one what is going on or what will happen and personalize for your situation. My son would pick this one up and look through it on his own. We have now had this book for three years and we are using it for the arrival of baby 3."
5,Great book for a new big brother or sister!,"Purchased this book for 2-year old daughter before her brother was born. Would recommend purchasing before baby arrives so can talk about what is going to happen. This book has no words in it, but allows parents to talk about each page and what is happening. It walks the child through a typical day with a new baby...bathing, feeding, and even daddy taking them to the park (I always said so Mommy can sleep!). It shows the toddler helping with the baby and we were able to talk about safety and how things would change when the baby arrives. We purchased a few different books before 2nd child for 2-year old and this was the best one by far. Very simple, but effectivly gets the point across. Would recommend for any soon to be brother or sister!"
5,Awesome!,"What a wonderful book to help ease the transition! I love the book! Daddy is a real help, it shows Mommy nursing, it also shows the baby getting presents, it shows the older sibling helping out too. The story can be told anyway you like! I really love this book and so does my 3 year old."
4,A nice picture book,"When we found out we were expecting our second child, we bought a few books for our son's age range, and this one is not his favorite. Perhaps it's because he can tell there isn't any real text to the story. Maybe I'm not the best narrator either...I really like that Kubler includes moments like the mom nursing, the dad taking baby and the older child for a walk, the baby screaming while dad changes the diaper, the older child staying up later than the baby, etc. It's pretty cute that way, although I find a couple of the illustrations a bit too busy.""The New Baby"" from Usborne publishing is my son's favorite. I highly recommend that one to everybody. The illustrations are so cute and they, too, show the mommy breastfeeding. The text is simple yet thorough, explaining issues like the mom and new baby being very tired and needing lots of help from the dad and other kids. If you're looking for something a little more, shall we say, complete...I recommend the Usborne one."
5,Fantastic!,"This is the perfect book for the newly awakened, think they maybe or those that are just curious about the vampire culture. I can't tell you how much The Psychic Vampire Codex has helped me in my life. So many questions that I had about myself that I couldn't find the answers to on the internet, I found here. A great book indeed!"
2,Its ok...,I had gotten this book sometime ago even through I don't know exactly when but when I did get this book I was very disapointed. Michelle did an exellent job finding out information about psychic vampires but it wasn't my cup of tea. I was hoping that the book psychic vampireism would at least teach you basic and advance psychic vampiric tecnects to drain the energy of human beings but sadly theres is very little. But then again very few books ever do. I'm just a power hungry man.;)
5,smart and quirky,"i have read perks of being a wallflower lookingfr alaska abundance of cthrines an all the rest of th books recommended and ths book defnty stands out. i us to skip thi book in the recomndatios beas the way th cover looked but that was misguiing. his book has tue raw emotions in it and is a wonderul aventure book. like all great books you et an emoiional attachmnt with cahracters willing them(pleadin them) to understand ech other. hs a fun quirky book that takes ou on an adventure for only one night, but even then our so into the book it fees longer . i recommend this for a fun fastread:)"
1,Poorest quality I've seen - and unfriendly service!,"- Incorrect bits were shipped - a #13 in place of a #3. The #3 was nowhere to be found.- At least a half-dozen were at least .003 to .004 out of size.- Inconsistent lengths, grinds, angles, flutes, thicknesses - the geometry is all over the place.- The bits have chips and gouges - some that appear to have occurred before coating and some afterward.The photos clearly show these things.When I objected to the seller, they insisted the items were correct, new, and of high-quality. They insisted that I pay return shipping and cover the original shipping if I ""didn't like"" the product.I'm objecting to Amazon, and would NOT recommend this seller."
5,Backofen Clarinet Concertos,"A similar Backofen recording was played by Karl Haas on NPR that he called a hidden gem. While I cannot locate the original recording that he played this one seems like a great substitute. The clarinet duos are melodic,soothing, and have some of the characteristics of Mozart compositions. I intend to purchase this CD."
5,my soy milk maker,"This machine make me life easier and better.Now, I need a cup of soymilk every morning.You?"
1,outdated and badly edited,"i found many mistakes in this book, including errors in formulas in the preparation chapters and miscalculations in the actual answers, not to mention numerous typos. the historical questions were written in the late 80's and haven't been updated since. and the tests overall are much easier than the real thing, so be careful. unfortunately, there isn't a great variety of econ gre books in the market, but if you can find another one, i'd try that before buying this outdated, badly edited book. [madmp@excite.com]"
4,Good CD,"My daughter likes this CD. I use it during calm playtime, no before bed, but it works for us. It is not annoying at all."
3,Not bad but not great,"Helps with putting my little ones to sleep, I use it in the car and at home. It doesnt go for a very long time that's the only draw back."
1,Do Not Buy,This is probaly the worst stroller I have ever bought for my daughter. I would not recommend this sroller for anyone. I bought this for my daughter at Christmas and when we put it together the wheel was busted so she couldnt even use it to push her baby X-Mas morn. Tried to take it back they would not due to me not having my receipt.
1,Not Worth It at All,"J Moss's previous CD was very good. He has a unique sound to his music but it is unbearable to hear it on almost all of the tracks on V2. My favorites are ""Praise on the Inside"" and ""Operator"" and the rest is forgettable and I want to forget them. Buy his first CD because it is better in every way and it has more variety than the annoying songs that blend into one lump of annoying on V2. This CD makes it seem as if he tried to hard and the only reason there are two stars are those two tracks. I wonder what he is thinking with this CD."
3,Its okkkk!!,This cd is okkk. I really like his first one so couldn't wait for this to coome out. Once i got it i put it in and was jammin off Jump Jump i listened to more and was like ok where are the worship like 'Work your faith' and 'We must Praise'. I still like it but its not as good as the last he gave varity this one is all the same pretty much. I still like him the best out of the family.
4,Good Music,Good music. I do like but I could use a few more up-tempo tracks. R&B is J Moss' thing and he does it very well. I like the collabos'. My wife loves this stuff. Check it out.
4,Alright!,"This album was a pleasure! I loved most of the songs on this album, The messages was on point and the creativity was killer but to tell you the truth one thing that is really starting to annoy me is his background vocals.They are killing me(LOL)!! If they annoyed you the first time round then brace yourself. He should come up with some more harmonies or something!! but overall a very nice album!"
5,Absolutely Bassey,"A Wonderful Album of songs! The title track alone is worth every penny spent on the entire album. As Bassey fans, you know what I mean. I purchased this CD because there are songs on it I don't have in other collections, and may I say, I love it. She's the best!"
3,Don't think it will speed up your photo taking!,"According to a Sony rep I just spoke to, having a high speed memory stick will only increase the speed of data transfer to your computer. It WON'T increase the ""save to camera"" speed at all! This little tidbit was not easy to come by as both an online chat and a email to Sony would yield only the information that the high speed sticks were ""compatible"" with my camera. One went so far as to not respond at all after I thanked them for helping me to increase the speed of my photo taking! I'm not sure who to believe. But until they get their stories straight, you might do well to save your money for a known quantity!"
5,Excellent product,"I thought this was the same jacket I saw at the mall for $200, but found out when I got it that it was actually a better jacket. Showed up in good time, and perfect condition. Would reccomend this to anyone looking to stay warm but not be sweating to death inside of it."
5,Chicken Skewers !!,My little 7# Ruby loves chewing on these Skewers and usually gets 2 a week. It's a good chew snack for her and usually takes her a day or two to finish one.
3,OK,"Like everyone else has said, it's an ok introduction to mythology. Covers mythology from many different societies."
3,"Loving, caring performance given to a cold, bitter piece","Ax and Salonen are, as usual, wonderful performers. They lavish careful attention to every detail in the Schoenberg Concerto. They approach this crass and ugly piece with loving care. They attempt to make music of this monstrosity created from a most unmusical compositional system. The Schoenberg is paired with two decidedly mediocre piano concertos, the two by Liszt. This is fortunate for the Schoenberg piece, for if concertos of the first rank, say, those by Bartok, for instance, were paired with Schoenberg's, they would make Schoenberg's Concerto sound ridiculous. I therefore give 5 stars to the performances, and 1 star to the pieces performed, thus arriving at my overall rating of 3 stars."
1,Big disappointment,"I've read the book ""Rough Guide to Cuban Music"" and I was looking forward to listening to this CD. Well, I feel I've wasted my money. Nothing caught my ear :-( The song selection looked good, but for every song I knew, the interpretation on this CD was awful. Listen to ""El Carretero"" on Buena Vista Social Club CD or listen to ""Al Vaiven de Mi Carreta"" on ""Putumayo Presents: Cuba"" and you'll know what I mean.I'm sure this CD's producer has chosen the worst (cheapest?) versions of other songs as well. I can only guess if he has no musical taste at all or just didn't have the money to produce a decent CD for the book."
5,"LIked it so much, bought a second","My son loved this seat so much we bought a second for the second car. Now he has cup holders at his reach, not in the middle of the car where he had to reach and stretch the seat belt. He stays sitting the way he should. And the lights are the best part! No more blinding lights when driving if he dropped something. He can reach them himself and they aren't disturbing."
3,Back was uncomfortable!,"Purchased this seat for my second son and didn't use the back very long. It sits straight up and was very uncomfortable for him to sit in. He was forced to lean forward a little and the back could not be adjusted to lean back at all. We ended up just removing the back, which he was legal height and weight to do. But I purchased this one for the extra security for him incase of a wreck. He had the same issue with falling asleep as other reviewers, either was unable to on long rides, or he fell forward since the seat already made him lean forward a bit anyway! We do like the base without the back for the cup holders on both sides and it has decent cushioning."
1,Don't believe everything you read,"Like most drama, not everything is accurate in this book, I believe the Campisi family was shown in a much more negative light than they should have been. Just because you read something, does not mean it is 100% true. Facts were twisted, stories fluffed, etc. While the Campisi's were involved in some illegal activities; this book makes them out to be cold-blooded murderers, not caring about anything or anyone except money.Do NOT believe all of this hype and mis-factuated material."
1,SERIOUSLY?!,"They used to make these years ago much better. What happened to those mats that had sleeves on 3 sides and all you had to do was insert a 1/4"" hose or 1/4"" PVC? That old one lasted me 15 years and I live in northern Ohio! I finally broke down and bought another. However, they must not make them like the one I had before. This mat is a nightmare. I was shocked when I received it because it must have had 35 plastic pieces of plastic to assemble on the mat. Took me FOREVER to put it together, but in the end I wish I had just shipped it back. Once it was together the very next day I pulled into my garage & just nicked one of the plastic pieces with my tire. CRACK! I mean, seriously? If anyone finds the type of mat I'm looking for (with the sleeves to just slip in a hose or PVC), please email me at cfrjohio@aol.com. This product is horrible - junk!"
1,Poor quality,"We purchased this costume for Halloween last year and within a month it had fallen apart. The photograph is rather deceptive in that the costume is of very poor quality in the fabric and stitching. It is clearly NOT worth the price. Unfortunately, if you're looking for a Sportacus costume and cannot sew, this is your only bet. We LOVE Sportacus in this household- especially mommy...wink wink...."
5,please...this is hands-down the best recording...,"Don't know what the previous reviewer (rappaport) was suggesting, but this is one of the crown jewels of Szell's tenure with the Cleveland Orchestra...Yoel Levi? He shines Szell's boots. Sawallisch...? OK in some repertoire, but no George Szell. He's a lacky by comparison...This CD is one of the true bargains of the era. Buy it before it's no longer available. You'll thank us later."
3,it does not work on every sony camera,"i know that my camera is obsolete, but i cannot find out which memory sticks work w/it, this one doesn't !!!!would be nice to know before buying it"
1,Do not buy this product,"According to Haier Customer Service, this thing is only designed to ""cool"" to 45 degrees F. That is completely inadequate in my mind for a ""beverage center."" This fact is not in the user manual and it is not documented anywhere in the detailed specs here or at Haier's website. If I had known this fact, I would NOT have purchased this machine. As it is, I will probably donate it to a charity organization and buy a product that is designed for use in the real world....and it won't be a Haier product."
4,High Sony quality...high Sony pricing,"Memory Sticks have always been great technology from day one. The Pro models are no exception. They have fast transfer speeds and are very reliable.Of course, that comes at a price. Compared to the other flash memory standards, Memory Sticks are expensive. Even the SanDisk ""generic"" Memory Sticks aren't that much cheaper than the genuine Sonys.The only other (well documented) drawback to the Pro models is the useless (for digicams) MagicGate feature that steals a fair amount of the total capacity of the card and can't be disabled. Sony really should remedy that for digicam users. Don't hold your breath though.4 stars because of the price issue and the MagicGate annoyance."
3,Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? The Best of Politically Incorrrect,"It is an alright product, but I would not buy it again, because it did not inform or give me any other information that I expected, and I would only watch it once - waste of money to buy something that I would use/view only once."
2,Book dragged on so much I didn't finish it,"This should have been a great romance novel. However, it is so bogged down in stupid dialogue that I wanted to scream ""Doesn't any publisher use editors any more?"" The same old discussions go on again and again and sometimes the dialogue is just a groaner. Example: After a discussion about an upcoming meeting. He: ""Do you have any questions?"" She: ""Did Adam have a navel?"" and the a page is spent with the heroine wondering why she asked such a dumb question. Indeed, I wondered that, too.I always finish a book but just couldn't stand anymore of the interminable dialogue and snail's pace of this one. Definitely don't buy at full price. This isn't one for your personal library."
3,Part two dumb and dumber,"I would only watch Dumb and Dumber with J.C., Part two, no thanks. J.C. is a good, having someone else play as him, again, no thanks."
3,"Not very lightweight or ""hot""","This dryer has plenty of air flow but not adquate heat for a professional level Hair Dryer. Worst of all, I chose this 3200 Twinturbo because the description refered to it as ""lightweight"". My shoulders ache after using it, so sure don't want to try to hold the other model like this one, if it is even heavier. Just flat-out disappointed in this model."
4,excellent replacement for oem honda fluid,"i have a 96 acura integra that had a slight grind going from 3rd to 4th gear. after reading on various honda forums on how people had good luck with this fluid, i also tried it myself and it got rid of that nasty grind i had. give it about 500miles to break in and any grind should dissapear. this is equivilent if not better to the expsensive honda manual transmission fluid. good stuff, im gonna change out my tranmission fluid again with this stuff. my only complaint is it is very hard to find."
2,Not as effective as I hoped,"When applied, you will get a sting if your skin is cracked, like mine, which becomes soothing after a few moments. The sting is just disinfecting so it didn't bother me much.After using the product for about 8 days I didn't see noticeable results. When first applied, 10 minutes in, some of the redness disappeared but then would return within 45 minutes or so. I tried applying moisturizing lotion after the psoriasin dried, the gel really dries out your skin, and still my psoriasis remained as present as ever.Product just didn't work for me."
2,Gel Stings!,This greenish yellow gel dries quickly when applied to the skin. However due to the alcohol content this gel really stings when first applied to cracked/blistery skin. That's painful enough to discourage me from regular use. The coal tar concentration is 1.25% which may be too low to be effective. I'm looking for at least 2% strength and a cream type next time.
4,Sandy's review,This toy is pretty much as it was when we had our kids EXCEPT the cord on the phone is way too short. Likewise the cord to pull the phone was too short so my husband had to rectify both cords. But I was happy to find the old fashioned phone.
4,cult classic romantic comedy set in NYC,"This film is smart and funny and low-key. It is set in actual bars in New York City's upper west side, so I felt a little nostalgic looking at places I used to go to, now that I live on the west coast. There are various twists and turns and various actors show up and then dissappear. There's a lot going on, and everyone is trading insults the whole time. Campbell Scott is great as always in the lead."
3,"Good but not the best by CHI-TOWN ""MIDWEST"" !","This is a good mix album with alot of Midwest rappers.The only ones that i enjoy listening to is Twista,Cwal Ballaz,Yung Buk,Newsense.It's a good album but i wouldn't buy it if i was you,i regret it myself..."
4,Cajun History,"This is a good history of Louisiana's Cajun people.However, it only mentions the Great Expulsion fromNova Scotia."
3,"This is not a review, this is a track listing.","1-Hämmerchen Polka 2-Das hab' ich in Paris gelernt 3-Fraulein 4-Die Mutter ist immer dabei 5-Das hat sich Tante Emma aus Italien... 6-Kleines Mädchen aus Berlin 7-Venus 8-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, wo ist meine Braut... 9-Mädchen für alles 10-Knallbonbon 11-Cleopatra 12-Der Dumme im Leben ist immer der Mann 13-Mama (Ma) 14-Verboten 15-Cosi-Cosi 16-Geh'n sie nicht allein nach Hause 17-Hundert schöne Frauen 18-Elisabeth 19-Sie weiss noch nicht, dass ich sie liebe 20-Gnädige Frau, wo waren sie gestern? 21-Das macht ja nix 22-Das tut gut, das tut gut, das tut gut 23-... und schuld daran sind nur die Frau'n 24-Schade, dass sie schon vergeben sind 25-Lilo, die tätowierte Dame 26-Pumpernickel und Babett 27-Wischi-Waschi, Bla-Bla-Bla 28-Japanisches Abschiedslied 29-Sagst Du alles Deiner Frau"
4,First Time Breed Owner,"I recently adopted a Great Pyrenees puppy and have never owned one before. This book was very helpful in understanding the breed better. The book has great pictures and information that I found very relative to the questions I had about this breed. There were a lot of tidbits I had no clue about that were brought to light such as these dogs will dig a ""bed"" to lay in to guard their territory. Totally explains why we keep finding holes in our front yard. Would recommend to anyone thinking about adopting their first Great Pyrenees."
5,Great Product,"Bought for my fiance. She has back,feet,and leg pains. The vibrations and heat are good for relieving all these pains."
3,"poor interpretation, great piece","This was the first version of Mahler's first symphony I heard. At firstI enjoyed it,however when I heard other versions, I found the interpretation could be better. I recomend the piece, but probably not this version. This version of the 10th is pretty good."
2,Badly Made!,"I got this watch for christmas this year and it broke the first day. I was able to fix it by taking the back off and re-screwing the tiny screws that are suppose to hold the computer board in place. But that only lasted a couple of hours. Also the little cap you see in the pic does not stay there, it just falls off and hangs. The only thing I can say that I like is the style and the sound quality is great. Its too bad they didnt make it a more reliable watch. I wish someone had left this for me to read before I asked for it for christmas. Oh yea dont expect any instructions the ones you get don't even belong to the watch you buy. So the instrustrions are useless. It came with no instruction or warrenty info......"
3,Intricate and Challenging!,"Los Angeles based musician Maurice Gainen has performed for audiences for about two decades. His latest CD is filled with many tracks that venture into different genres including Latin, Asian, African and Gospel. Some tracks are very intricate and challenging such as the funk based, ""Ca Va?"" or the Argentine influenced ""Mango"". Some are easy to listen to. I personally enjoyed the tracks, ""June in May"" with its hip and funky style & ""In the Air"" with smooth sounds from guest vocalist, Tony award nominee, June Angela. (You may remember her from the PBS children's show, The Electric Company.) This is a mixed bag of music that will please some listeners."
5,Brutally honest and worth every penny,"Mr. Benedict is a brutally honest and courageous individual. Where others would think and consider, he simply does. He provides encouragement for others to give up meat, sugars, etc. and seek out nature's healing path.I recommend Confessions highly, especially for those people who a disillusioned with the foods that they are eating. It may just make the difference between health and longevity versus sickness.Thank you."
1,Careful,"Not someplace I would buy from again. The product does not work as described. We have attempted to contact the seller. The phone only has answering machine for a message and they NEVER return the calls. We contacted Toshiba and they sent new discs and everything to try and fix the machine and then told us to return it to the seller. We are STILL trying to do that with NO SUCCESS. ""Beware"""
4,soho2 review,"i have a sonicwall soho2.i've owned it over two years now.it's a very nice firewall.i'm much happier than any of my friends using linux machines as firewalls, or using cheaper netgear/linksys hw firewalls.(those things are apparently a nightmare to configure and not capable of much real firewall sophistication.)the sonicwall's strength is a very nice web user interface for setting up firewall rules.it's intuitive to use and extremely powerful.i haven't run into much i couldn't get it to do.the downside? the only downside is the price.it's overpriced, and they nickle and dime you for add ons like the vpn and the antivirus upgrades.overall i'm happy, and i'd buy the soho2 over again.if i were to buy it again, i'd buy a version of the box with a dmz port. i've wished i had that a couple times.i would not buy it as a vpn solution. it's way too expensive.and the antivirus addon was pretty lame. i used that for a year and didn't like it. again the main issue was price."
4,Reference Book,"The book presents material designed perhaps for an advanced graduate class on computational complexity.In order to follow the material it covers you need to have already mastered a class on theory of computation or have some mathematical maturity due to the language used in this book. If you want to learn, you should definitely not start with this book, you should probably go with Sipser's book, which I have found really useful. This book on the other hand covers far more material and serves better as a reference book, since it contains a compendium of most of what computational complexity covers as a field.It also contains a very interesting literature review summary at the end of each chapter that tells you the development of each topic and the main publications, authors involved in the process."
2,"Big, heavy, and few extras","Yes, the color screen is great, but....It's embarrasingly large, and even heavier. The ear buds won't stay in your ears and it didn't come with a protective carrier or clip of any sort. No FM, no voice recording. For the money, i think there are better picks out there."
3,It's okay.,"As a longterm martial artist, I bought this DVD, seeking yoga instruction that would bring me a combination of strength and flexibility. I've since studied more Yoga on the net, exploring different poses, etc. As such, I've found this tape okay for a beginner, but really limited. Where are the balance poses, which would make alot of sense for a martial artist? Also, this DVD is broken into different modules (4 different Sun Salutations, Seated poses, etc.) It would have been helpful if there had been some instruction as to combinations of modules to use in one session (ie: one sun saluation, two other modules, or similar.) So...I give this a qualified recommendation, but only for basic yoga beginners."
4,Rhinoskin I-pod case works great,"I really liked using the Rhinocase, because it did a good job of protecting my Ipod nano. With it's clear cover, and aluminium backing I really could use it affectively. You can still see what you are doing, except when it gets dropped a lot it is hard to see through the cover part."
1,"Redundant, redundant, redundant.","I have never written one of these reviews before, but I thought I should warn people about these tapes. You get 6 tapes and I am not exagerating in the least, they all say the same thing over and over and over. He uses 3 or 4 sentences the same ones on every tape and throughs in 1 and I mean only 1 different word per tape. Not what I would call motivating, but hey maybe to some. I am returning the tapes immediately."
5,I LOVE THIS MUSICAL!!,"Perhaps it is simply nostalgia (my parents had this record when I was young -- until I absconded with it!), but this recording is by far my preference of the three available. I love the quality of the voices which do not sound like modern singers at all -- very charactery and very fun."
3,It's okay,"My son loved it, of course, as he loves anything Thomas but it's a little boring. We have a full-sized lift-the-flaps book about Thomas which has many trains and lines up perfectly with the pictures under the flaps. That's not the case with this book. The story is short and the pictures in this book just aren't very interesting."
5,train lover,i bought this book for my sons 2ry birthday he just turned three and he still loves this book and its one of his favorites on our book shelf i am more than happy with this purchase.
2,Next? I'll second that,"I bought ""NO LYE!"" Tuesday and returned it Wednesday. It was not nearly what I expected after all of the rave reviews. The illustrations were limited and the sections on twists was no help at all. I bought ""Textured Tresses"" today and love it. There is a lot of celebrity name dropping but who cares. It is well written and provides product names, numerous illustrations, detailed how-to's and a salon directory. Also there is a section on picking the right stylist and salon that I found helpful. Don't waste your money on ""NO LYE!"". No lie."
4,The book was absolutly wonderful.,"It gave me alot of ideas on how to care for and style my newly natural mane. The book examines how chemicals are actually frying your hair. Is there any way for fried hair to be really healthy? I think not! This book, unlike many other black hair care books, gives you a scientific explaination to why some of our hair care habits are unhealthy. I have learned so much from this book. keep up the good work!!! I am truly happy being nappy."
4,A history lesson in grrrl rock,"For those who thought girl power only consisted of Elastica, The Donnas, and the Spice Girls (g-d help us!), they they desperately need to listen to a CD like God Bless The Go-Go's. They've cleaned up their acts, and they sound like they never broke up. Berlinda's vocals are as fresh as they ever were, and Weidlen's back up vocals and guitar still compliment the band's LA sound. Songs like ""Kissing Asphault"" and ""La-La Land"" will take people back to the days of TalkShow . ""Vision of Nowness"" is lovely. Some poeple will be thankful the 80's are over, but this album proves a lot of good came out of it."
1,"Go Go's ""No Go""","God Bless the Go-Go's, to this reviewer, is a very disappointing effort from a band that I had held in high esteem back in the 80's. You would think that after 18 years they could have come up with better material then appears on this offering. Nothing catchy here, only retread, tired or cliched songs. I for one had been anticipating this release for many a year, but I guess the old saying is true ""Beware of what you wish for, you just might get it."" And what's with all the Catholic imagery? Hasn't that already been done by another all girl band?"
3,A surprisingly good return after so long apart,"After what, 15+ years of not writing and recording together, the Go-Go's come up with a pretty good collection of new material. It definitely has the energy and the sound, while not sounding dated. Unfortunately the songs are overall not quite as long lasting or memorable as some of their best, with ""Automatic Rainy Day"" and a couple of others being exceptions, and the rest still being pretty decent, and Belinda sometimes slips into what I would call her ""solo chanteuse"" voice,. Still, it's great to have them back with some new stuff and this is still a worthwhile album for enjoying and marking the Summer of 2001. If you're an old fan, I'd say get it, if you're new to the Go-Gos I'd start with Beauty and the Beat, then come back to this later."
1,Brains Turn To Sand,"When Belinda Carlisle was a yoot she was iconoclastic, opionated, and articulate. The Go-Go's wrote passionate songs with interesting lyrics. Now that they have gotten old they retread every musical cliche they can accentuate and write song after song spouting every cliche shoved down our throats. Why is it that the people who spout the idea of personal responsibility have the most to be sorry about? Why is it that the people that claim the most freedom are the biggest sheep? Why? Because the system is set up to wear down the brains of anyone that every had an ounce of rebellion by tearing them down until there only hope for salvation is some fairy tale. God Bless The Go-Go's!!! Zeus Bless Me!!! If you want to behave responsible and have any freedom from aversive controls stay away from this crap and start questioning the system. The only way to avoid manipulation is to understand manipulation. CD's like this are the Enemy! Complete Crap!!!!"
1,The Eighties...Uhhggggg!,"When I think of the musical wasteland known as the eighties, I don't have to go any further than the go-go's to find its essence. Having no idea how to play their instruments, write a song, or vocalize, the go-gos' shooting stardom highlights the joke played on the music buying public of that era (n' sync is currently perpetrating this crime). From the gag of the go-go's to the syntho trash of duran duran, almost every band that made it on the pop charts in the eighties provided the burgeoning MTV generation with mind-numbingly bad music.This album represents an amazing phenomena from a bunch of forty-something hacks. After twenty plus years, they still can't play, sing, or write songs of substance. They were awful then, and they are still awful."
2,Lackluster,"I liked the 80's Go-Go's just fine as MTV cutie pin-up dolls and the handful of pop singles they had, up to their last album, ""Talk Show"" (""Head Over Heels"" was great). But I tried this reunion comeback album and despite listening to it a few times, it just refused to grow on me and I ended up trading it in towards something else. I think the ladies are fine instrumentalists and Belinda Carlisle has a great voice, but the problem with this album for me was the material just didn't grab me - it didn't break any new ground for them. Maybe next time..."
4,Review: The Nature of Cape Cod,"The new book , The Nature of Cape Cod, by seasoned geologist/naturalist and first-time author, Beth Schwarzman, is informative, beautifully finished with clear detailed maps, and has a writing style that blends important lessons on living in harmony with the natural Cape system with interesting information and facts about the Cape from its geologic beginnings at the end of the Ice Age up to the present day. This book is a welcome addition to the libraries of all who love exploring and appreciating Cape Cod."
1,I didn't mean to break it.....,"I borrowed this blender from a neighbor to make margaritas(or something). I had it on for no less than a minuet and the motor froze-up. Big bellows of smoke filled the kitchen, now i'm stuck buying her a new 52204 because they don't sell motors. This blender wouldn't be my first choice, i would buy something with more balz. Maybe Hamilton Beach will be kool and warantee this one for me. Peace in the East, Paulo Loco"
1,Waste of money,"I purchased one of these, and noticed a strange odor right away from the motor area. After six uses, the motor burned out. Never did work well, weak performance all around."
4,A good cheap sampler of Haggard's Epic Hits,"These 10 songs were all released between 1982 and 1986 on the Epic label. All are original recordings. 8 of the 10 songs were top 10 hits, and 3 reached the #1 position. There are more complete collections of Haggard's work available, but for the price, this is still a pretty good bargain."
4,A good overview of Francis's most important writings,"Regis Armstrong, O.F.M. Cap., applies his extensive scholarly knowledge of Franciscan primary sources to produce a readable introduction for the layperson. Includes many new translations by Armstrong. Book is organized as a commentary with excerpts from Francis's writings interspersed throughout. The book has no index -- a major flaw which makes the book far less usable than it should be."
5,A Rossini Gem,"This rarely produced Rossini opera is a gem. While some may say ""There's probably a reason it's never done,"" in this case it's valid--it was written for the coronation of Charles X an quickly withdrawn by Rossini. The score was ""lost"" until the 1970s. While probably not Rossini's best work, it's still a ""find."" With a huge cast that allows Rossini to show off many styles of writing, this is a winner. Of course, the highlight is the Concertato for 14 Voices (yes...that is 14 voices!!). Snap this up quickly before it's forgotten again!"
5,Fabulous...,"Buy this if for no other reason than to hear Cheryl Studer sing as she was intended to sing. The entire cast is delicious and so is the opera. I also have a DVD which doesn't have the cast, but is worth it for the production, the costuming alone is wonderful, if hardly traditional. So what? It's a lot of fun.Nancy Eckert"
3,Total Chick Bait,"Yep, this book is fine for getting college chicks to dig you. Just have a copy of it on your bedside table and they will think you are sensitive and will be all over you. Don't bother to read the book - just keep it in plain sight."
1,Save your money.,"It seems there are two types of people when it comes to raising children. The first group eats lots of whole grains, worries about their child's aura and the alignment of their chakras. The second group works, pays taxes, and tries to live their lives. If you're in the chakra crowd you'll love this book. It has lots of feel good/new age garbage. The down to earth crowd (like me) found this book only fit for starting a fire. If you want guilt about circumcision buy this book. If you want real help try something else."
5,Best one yet!,We've listened to a lot of Wiggles around our house for 6 years now. This is their best album yet. The songs are catchy and fun. The sound of Sam and Ringo make it wonderful. The Wiggles have made a big mistake getting rid of Sam. He added a lot of musical talent to the group. We won't be buying anything new from the Wiggles.
5,love it,i loved it.... we caught this movie in the middle and could not find it on again so i ordered it from amazonmy mom also borrowed it and watched it also so she liked it
5,Excellent depiction of Genocide and its outcomes,Used this video in my class on genocide in Southeast Asia and the changes within the Cambodian society durring the rule of the Khmer Rouge.
3,A- in propaganda D in history,"Whle there were some touching moments in this movie it was must definitly ""ideaological"" Like almost all hollywood movies of the last 40 years it had a very difficult time showing the communists for what they were, murderous thugs. The Khmer Rouge killed well over 1 million people in Cambodia in 4 years (some estimates range as high as 4 million), yet in this movie the only killing seen by the viewer, except for a brief battle scene and one land mine, all the killing in this movie is done by B 52's. the movie tries to make the case that it was the American bombing of Cambodia that was responsible for the brutality of the Khmer rouge, sorry it just doesn't wash with me. If that were the case why weren't the communist in Vietnam and Loas at least as brutal, they were bombed at least as hard and far more often then Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the crimesand no one else, except maybe the Chinese who supported them with weapons and other aid."
2,"Nothing New Here, Really","I do agree with other reviewers that this is a good quality DVD visually. Certainly the colour is truer to form than other releases have been and the usual problem with NTSC DVDs played on PAL machines, the blurry picture, has been overcome.However, I bought this edition for the commentary from director Bill Norton. Sadly, there isn't that much commentary and what there is deals with matters obvious to anyone who can freeze-frame the credits and check the IMDB. The only thing in the commentary of note was that Bill Norton is 67 but sounds about 27.If you already have a copy of Gargoyles on DVD, this one takes up room on your shelf for not a great deal extra."
4,This led to many a sleepless night!,"This movie scared the daylights out of me and my sisters, but we would scan the TV Guide every week to see if it was on so we could watch it again! Glad it's on VHS/DVD now so I can share the same scary experiences with my kids!"
2,Not good.,I have to be sincere: this is the only book I bought I'd like to return or donate . Nothing about constructing a song. It is mostly about the music business (whcih I don't care at this time). maybe that's the reason this company decided to make another Idiot book for songwrting. Just my two cents.
5,works fine,"Works fine and the price was great (1 penny + shipping), so I bought 2 more just to have extras, especially since my husband keeps stealing my charger."
3,Not bad,I like Julie Delpy and she always shines . This film wasn't fabulous but it was nice to watch and I would watch it again.
3,Fleetwood Mac ages like fine wine - better ALL the time!,"I saw Fleetwood Mac on this tour 3 times and let me tell you - while most bands don't live up to the quality of their past, Fleetwood Mac is like fine wine: getting better ALL the time. This DVD is a great example of their 2003-2004 Say You Will World Tour. It showcases all of their great hits and treats you to a few special moments. The sound of the band is great, the DVD sound quality is superb, the picture is crystal clear. My personal highlight is ""Stand Back"" because Stevie becomes ""solo Stevie"" with her trademark dancing and spins that she only does on her solo tours. Absolutely awesome. At 54 she's still the queen of rock. If you're a Fleetwood Mac fan or not, BUY THIS DVD."
3,not as good as expected,i thought this would be a much better cd than it was. just not what i expected from fleetwood mac
4,Oklahoma at it's GREATEST,If you liked the movie Oklahoma and are looking for a CD with all your favorite Oklahoma songs on it; this is the one for you. I have throughly enjoyed it myself. Don't leave this site without adding this wonderful CD to your collection.
3,It was okay but not my favorite one,It's okay but not as good as the others I have ordered. It is a bit boring. Some stories were okay. Sherlock Holmes voice was not always distinct for me to identify who was talking at times
5,What a great old game,I have this game for C64 and PC and enjoy them both.I bought this as a backup copy in case my original quits working.It arrived quickly and in good shape.
2,"horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!","My then husband and I thought it'd be a good idea to get this stroller because it was less than $100 at Target and Walmart, so we figured, go for it! We were going to So. Cal for the weekend and figured it'd be great to have to go around Disneyland. Ooooh goodness, no! It was heavy with my kids in there, and they aren't that heavy - my son was practically a newborn at the time and my daughter was 2 at 19lbs (she's petite). We thought it was just because we used the stoller a lot during the trip we'd give it a rest, then we started using it regularly and brought it with us the following year back to So. Cal. The wheels started bending over when my daughter sat down, it started getting harder and harder to steer... To me, it WAS worth the cheap price. DO NOT GET... HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!!!"
4,Yet another trip back to my childhood fears,"This is another in a line of movies I have bought and watched lately that I used to watch on the late night movies that C.B.S. used to run every night. I was surprised to find that time has been very kind to this one.Long ago the book of the souls that had been claimed by Satan was stolen and he wants it back. The family that has it is in trouble now. With an all-star cast this little horror movie is more fun than it should be. Not great but I found myself getting into it all over again. If your old enough to remember it then I think you would enjoy it again, as for younger horror fans, I don't know you might like it but probably won't so rent it first."
1,Typical Occult movie of its time.,"It's a bit weird,creepy and scary at first especially when your a kid. but not a big deal.In hindsight a goofy movie and typical of it's time and the rage around the occult. although Ernest Borgnine is great."
5,Bellísima grabación.,Esta bella grabación de el Codex Las Huelgas hecha por Paul Van Nevel es un extraordinario trabajo de música medieval en base a una de los más interesantes obras recogidas en Monasterios femeninos a finales del S. XIII en España.El trabajo es pulcrísimo en cuanto a la interpretacion de esta interesante música y muy hermosas las voces de las solistas. Recomendable disco de música medieval.
1,Something's really wrong here....,"Some of my Catholic friends really liked this book, so I readit. But it made me wonder about one BIG question. The authornever says a word about his reactions to taking a vow ofcelibacy. Isn't this a pretty important thing? Isn'tsexuality an important part of life, whether or not you chooseto be celibate? There is not a word said about girlfriendsor lack of girlfriends when he was a layman. This too iscurious. A rector of major Catholic seminary has recentlywritten a book saying many seminarians are homosexuals. Ipersonally do not believe that, but a book like this makesme wonder about the author. He also avoids the severe declinein numbers that the Jesuit order is going thru. Why is this?"
2,A Household Staple but NO company back-up,"I buy farberware everything: knives, pots and pans etc. But last year my newish pot cracked. The company told me to send it in for a refund. That was 8 months ago and in spite of calls to the company, I still have not seen the refund or a replacement pot. They say it takes time, but how much time...."
1,millenium farberware,"I have purchased this brand of product in the past with a ""lifetime"" warranty, but when there is a problem the company has not backed up its warranty."
4,Farberware MILLENIUM cookware,"I have been using a Farberware MILLENIUM omlet pan for more than ten years, and a Saucier of the same brand for two years. I find them to be excellent cookware. They can take any temperature I need, they heat evenly, nothing ever sticks to them, and they are amazingly easy to clean. The only reason I haven't replaced everything else I cook in with Farberware MILLENIUM is the high cost. I believe they are worth the price, and this new collection, at this price, is a definite bargain."
3,Video Flicker on start up,HeyI go this on the cheap and didn't expect much but after 2months it began to flicker when booting up. Looking for invoice for warranty info right now :( Good over all picture when not flickering.
4,One tiny problem,"For the most part this is a good case. It protects my ipod, while allowing access to everything I need to use it. The only problem - the square at the bottom intended to allow you to charge the ipod while it's in the case isn't quite big enough. But, since the case is made of leather, it's easy enough to cut a slightly bigger opening."
2,Could only wear one season,"I bought these socks around this time last year. Very pretty, very comfortable. However, they developed so many holes from normal, regular use that there is no point in my continuing to repair them. I think wool socks at this price should last more than one season."
3,"Based on the Publisher, not Jim's work","Jim Morrison's poems: A+++, amazing, insightful, ingenious.This copy of the book disappointed me a little. There's a spelling error in the first verse, come on guys, better editing. Also the Intro & Prologue aren't anything special, they basically took exact excerpts from No One Here Gets Out Alive.The only saving grace is the high-quality, handsome images printed throughout the book."
1,This makes Sister look like a bully!,"This is the worst Berenstain Bear book ever! What happened to ""Leave me alone"" or ""Sticks and stones can break my bones..."" or just plain old IGNORING? This book teaches kids how to get rid of a bully by hitting him/her in the face, and all will be well. :(Ignoring might not work as good as it used to, but at least it's better than hitting someone! Stan and Jan should have thrown this reject book away!"
4,Kids need to defend themselves.,"I have to disagree with most of the other reviews. I don't think simply ignoring a bully works these days, it sounds nice but it simply doesn't work. Children shouldn't start fights but if they are being beaten up, they need to defend themselves and that's exactly what this book teaches."
5,Incredible!,"More than any other Christian CD I own, this CD expresses my journey in Christ. This album is very personal and very real. No preachy platitudes, but real thoughts and feelings from a man who is incredibly in love with God. ""Love Take Time"" is my favorite song on the CD, ""Have you ever been lied to/ Maybe mistreated/ Taken for granted till you just can't stand it/ Have you ever thought to be someone you just can't be/ Where's the love that you need"" Thoughts that too many followers are afraid to say. Thank you Bryan for such an inspiring CD!"
5,What is goth?,"Very funny first book by Voltaire. If you are a Voltaire fan,this is the book for you. Or if you want to read about the gothic scene from a fun perspective, I highly reccommend this book."
1,"Nasty, nasty and junk","Sometimes you never know until you open the package and start playing one of these dvd's. Well I found out and believe me when I say it was at times nasty, funny and I don't believe what I'm watching. Unless there's another one like this out there, I can honestly say that I've now seen it all in adult movies."
1,What a piece of garbage,This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. It was not daring and provocative more gross and pointless. The dubbingmade the dialogue stupid. The plot was just plain idiotic.It was as erotic as a hangover. Add to that several scenesof horse copulation and this is one of the worst moviesof all time. Don't buy this it will only annoy you and makeyou sick. A complete piece of garbage. It got one star onlybecause I couldn't give a lower rating.
3,Good Bedtime Reading,"I like light fare for my bedtime reading and I like stories about women. This was perfect. A few pages at a time, it lasted me for months. Nothing deep that I have to ""get something out of"". I do agree though, that the ending left something to be desired."
5,"A raunchy tale of sex, lust, and power.",Lasse Braum is such an legendary author. It was great to read such raw tales of sex from someone who was such a big part of sexual revelation. I could not put the book down I was so hungry for reading more.
2,"Not bad, but not worth it.","My son loves them, but to me it is not worth it, as it takes 3 as a servig so then it is more like giving him candy rather than a vitamin! and at 3 a day they don't last long."
3,"Good, but marred by the presence of Goldhill.","This is not as bad as one would expect given the general awfulness of Simon Goldhill's oeuvre. However, the sections authored by him so degrade and debase the book that the otherwise useful chapters it contains are debased by the presence of its co-editor. Readers would be advised to skip Goldhill's parts or even, as I did, physically remove them from the tome. Given that he is so utterly devoid of anything vaguely resembling talent, one can only wonder why on earth the man goes on. And on. And on..."
1,Spy Hook goes nowhere,"This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed."
1,Spy Hook Sinks,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is dull, boring, and you don't even have a clue as to what is going on until about the 20th chapter (and it only has 22 chapters)."
3,Get a free iPod Video instead!,"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod Video 60GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: awesomestufffree.com/ipod-video"
4,"Good, but some flaws","I just got this MP3 player recently and found it to be quite good. The most noticeably feature is the screen, the colors and graphics are amazing. You can also rearrange the display of the screen from portait to landscape and upload pictures and music easily. I am currently using the software they provide you with. Although it takes some getting used to, once you understand it, it is quite easy. The Gigabeat misses in its buttons. The cursor is easy to manage, but because it doesn't light up, in the dark it can be hard to manage. Besides the software problems (getting used to it) the only other problem that I have with it, is that there is no radio built in. But this is just a personal preference. This product deserves a 4.5/5."
5,This film embodies the American dream of serving your countr,"I agree with Maltin's comment on sentimentality, but, the values expressed in this film are exactly the kind that Americans say are rapidly diminishing in our society. If I had my way, all 9th grade students would be required to watch this film."
3,Cyberfarming is not fun,"Following on from 'Time of Your Life', the Doctor tales Grant back to his home planet Agora. But what Grant doesn't remember (he was very young when he was sent away) is that the Cybermen are using Agora as a farm - they call back every few year to capture and convert humans to Cybermen. And here they come now...This book spotlights Grant quite considerably, given that the Doctor is imprisoned for a good portion of it. As the new companion, we get to find out a lot of Grant's background, as does he. But the circumstances under which he learns things are not the best. While Grant goes through the emotional wringer, the Doctor gets the physical version as the Overseers and the Cybermen masters try some things out on him...Fairly relentless in its grimness, the book certainly isn't the easiest to read. However, I recommend you persevere as it is worth your while - the eventual success of both the Doctor and Grant in the face of considerable adversity shows true triumph."
1,No customer service avaiable,"I ordered this product for my son's camera. Unfortunately it wasn't the right memory stick (these things are so confusing) Anyway I contacted the seller via email about maybe exchanging for the correct one but no one ever got back to me. I emailed 3 times and nothing. Even if I couldn't return it, I would of appreciated a response to let me know something.I will never buy from these folks again."
3,Only works well on a high heat setting...,I bought this curling brush for travel since it is lightweight. It isn't as good as my regular curling brush that works with energy cells and is cordless. But it is fine once you get used to it. The only problem I had with it so far is burning my fingers a few times. This doesn't work on my hair on the low setting so I have to turn it onto high. The heated metal section of the brush really does heat up fast and is not protected by any plastic. So you just have to be super careful. One thing I do like about this brush is the tangle-proof swivel cord.~The Rebecca Review
4,Great little humidor,"This is a perfect little humidor for those just begining to enjoy cigars (like myself). The humidor arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Make sure to prepare your humidor before you begin putting cigars in, or else you'll end up with a bunch of dried out smokes.My only complaint (as mentioned by others) is that the humidifer is attached with a cheap piece of velcro. I had to use a little dab of glue to get the pieces to stick to the back of the humidifer and another dab to get the other piece onto the top of the humidor.Overall, a great product. Looks classy and wasn't too expensive."
4,Pretty decent little humidor...,"Not too shabby at all. It's nothing fancy, but it looks good and does the trick. The actual humidification device is cheap, but it works (plus, you can buy better ones for a few bucks)."
3,humidoe,"The humidor that I ordered was not the one that was sent, but it's nice and serves the purpose. The humidor I received did not have a humidity gauge and has a clear glass top. Still nice. Satisfied."
3,Cheap but nice looking.,"The humidor has a nice dark wood looking finish and lined with felt, so it will not scratch your furniture. The humidifier and hygrometer is held on, by a Velcro strip so it does look a little cheap, but look at the price.Overall, I say that you get the best little humidor that $20 can buy. The few months I have had it I have enjoyed it. Every time the lid is opened, the wonderful aroma of the cedar and hand rolled cigar smell pleases the senses of the body.The company that shipped my order arrived in about 2-3 days. As well, charged less then actual shipping costs."
1,"As it is written there are none righteous, no not one.","There was a part in this movie when one of the disciples asked Jesus what a person must do to be saved. If I remember right Jesus answered to believe in Him and to love thier neighbor. This is not Biblical. Yes the Bible says to love your neighbor, but that is not what will save you. Only faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross can save you and ensure eternal life."
4,Great depiction,"A touching family film for young children to grasp the love and tenderness of our wonderful God. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a cartoon for their family that accurately depicts the story of our savior, Jesus Christ."
2,Read THE BIRD ARTIST instead.,"I picked up THE NORTHERN LIGHTS after having read Norman's superb second novel, THE BIRD ARTIST, and was disappointed. Although reviews were strong for this book, and I believe it was a National Book Award finalist, it felt like an apprentice effort to me. The characters and situations were strange--as they often were in THE BIRD ARTIST--but not nearly as compelling. The plot was loose and slippery, and didn't cohere by the end of the novel. It felt like Norman was trying too hard to be obscure and poetic. This is a mediocre first novel, but does hint at the wonderful things to come. Now go read THE BIRD ARTIST."
5,"Quality cookware, good in the oven","This cookware set cooks everything just right. I watch my food, as it cooks, very carefully and adjust the heat level fairly low since the pans heat up fast and evenly. The bottoms fit my burners on my electric stove except for the smallest of the set. The handles and tops get hot so be careful. The advantage is that these can all be put in the oven above 350 degrees. I have used them in the oven many times. The stainless steel is beautifully polished to a mirror finish and cleans as well as nonstick. I always handwash and the exteriors still look new after a almost two years. You can put them in the dishwasher for convenience but the shine will fade. Great set, looks good and well built. Why pay more?"
5,Great,"Great gift for my son, a huge WWE fan. The finishing move are legend, and he loved every minute of it."
3,Old technology but dependable up to a point,"I bought the ps-70 since it was on sale. The new cross-cut shredders are now the in-thing and rightly so. This strip shredder will leave some ""strips"" still attached so that a determined thief might get enough to steal your SS number. Overall, its OK protection and the cross-cuts have more dependability issues since a more complex cutter system. If I were a banker or spy, I would go with the newer cross cuts; for home use this is OK."
4,"Hey Hippies, Don't Play With Dead Thing or the Occult","Like Lemora, which I just finished reviewing, I also use the watch this film on WOR-TV 9 and I thought was very creepy and fun! This film is very similair to the film ""Night of the Living Dead""! Even though ""Dead Things"" was in most aspects inferior to ""Living Dead"" it has a more creepy atmosphere and sound effects, the ghouls looked more terrorfying (looked like they been dead for a longer period of time and they showed them crawling out of the grave, unlike ""Living Dead"") and the cast seemed more humorous and fun to watch!There is somethings about the film I didn't like (Christ name taken in vain, some of the Ghouls look rather corny, and bad music), but bottom line it is fun film to watch if you enjoy low budget, very creepy, horror film of the early 70's like I do!"
2,"Well, maybe there's worse","I'm a huge Zombie movie fan and not one to rip up a movie that doesn't deserve it...well, this one does. The acting is terrible, maybe even worse than terrible, and the special effects are beyond lame. The only good part is the very end."
5,an oldie but a goody.,I got this DVD as a gift to my husband from my son. He loved it and wanted a better copy for his collection. He was very pleased with it.Thanks.
4,So bad it's awesome!!!,"This movie, I can not deny, was badly made. But it was an early 70's b-movie, and it was cool and I enjoyed every inch of it! And this has a message, DON'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS!!! LOL! the end-"
1,History Distorted,"Fawn Brodie is a woman who researched her subject carefully and then, and this can be proven, created her own make-believe sources and quoted them. She took actual events and then twisted them ever so slightly to add a negative bent to the event. How do I know this - I have spent the last two years in extensive research of Joseph Smith, Jr. I read dozens of books, diaries, letters and journals. Fawn Brodie's was by far, the worst one I read because she took a personal agenda and applied it to an historic subject. She should have stuck to the truth, not created quotes and sources, then she may have had a real book on Joseph Smith, Jr."
1,Terrible Laminator,This laminator is terrible. It will ruin 1 in 4 items laminated if not more. The machine always gets jammed and it is difficult to unjam. I am very disappointed and irritated with this produce. Would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Love The Closer!,I really love watching the episodes of The Closer! I am ready to begin season 5 and am already dreading running out of shows to watch when I get to the end of the series!
5,The point is not the packaging its the TV show,"Forget what anyone says about the packing, that isn't what you're buying. You're buying the show. To be honest I downloaded it rather than mess with the dvd.Anyway this is an excellent series. One of the better ones on TV (and there aren't that many). The writing is unique and Kyra Sedgwick does a great job at portraying a cop who is good at their job, but not her life.Add in some good acting from the others in the show, and you have something that is worth watching. I recommend it."
5,The Closer Fourth Season,This was purchased for a Christmas present and was a huge hit. The show will bring lots of hours of enjoyment.
2,"useful, but not for GMAT","For anyone who wants to refresh their basic maths ability this workbook is a worthwhile buy. However, the many questions in the book have very little relevance to the questions you will face on the actual GMAT exam. However, this is true of most of the other GMAT preps book too."
2,"Helpful, but confounded with egregious math typos","I'm currently halfway through this book and have already found three signficant math typos in the questions. These aren't simple grammatical errors - they are mistakes in the formulas that yield a different answer than the back of the book! The answer explanations make sense if you can infer what the problem should be, but these problems will leave the reader confused more than anything else.And this is the FIFTH edition!"
1,no luck,"tried this with a mouse-- ps2 to usb.. windows 7 could not figure what driver to use..did not work.tried with a keyboard-- ps2 to usb.. windows xp did not find the device either.it may be possible to manually configure, has anyone got this adapter to work?ps2 devices probably do not give off the signature needed for windows to configure it."
4,great to see...,it's nice to see something 'new' of selena... this release isn't what we've been promised but it's still a must for any selena fan...
4,Honor Thy Wife,"A richly woven tapestry of plot, character, and setting. I stumbled upon Norman Bogner's previous book by accident and liked it so much that I scrambled to get the new one as soon as I heard it was out. What a surprise. Honor Thy Wife is very different from To Die in Provence: no detective, no lurid crimes, and a strictly American setting. But it wasn't a disappointment. It is as rich in characterization and intrigue, though on a quieter and more familiar scale. I also felt I got a good sense of what life was like in the 1960s for the regular people who lived through a decade that's often portrayed as nothing but sex and drugs and student protests. I can't wait to see what this obviously versatile writer will come up with next. --"
3,Facts distorted,"The book was entertaining, but just after the release Kevin Poulsen did several interviews about the book. During those interviews Kevin P. mentioned that the author made it look like Kevin was doing most of the ""crimes"", while in fact the other people involved had more of a role than the book gave them ""credit"" for. Old newpaper articles show this also."
1,Vexation on Ice,"Forget this ice crusher. It fails in all important areas. It only succeeds in looking cool. It is awkward to operate. On ours, the screw which holds the works together keeps coming unscrewed requiring an annoying reassembly. It is seriously unbalanced. There is no mechanical advantage built into its design. Really, shop around, there must be a better idea out there somewhere."
1,"Looks great, works awful!","This ice crusher barely did just that. It was incredibly hard to turn the crank, the ice didn't get any smaller than an inch in diameter, and it jumped all over the counter while I was grinding. Not to mention the wet mess it left everywhere. ... I wouldn't waste my time or money. Buy an electric crusher!"
1,Save the box that this came in,Save the box because you will be sending this back. I wish I would have...I ended up spending 20 more bucks for an electrical crusher. This one is hard to use and the ice is still relatively large. I can not see this one ever being used! There should be less than one star cuz I would give it ZERO!
3,Tighten the nut on the crank shaft.,"I used the Metrokane ice-crusher for the first time and it really worked well...the ice was crushed easily and was crushed in seconds....however when I cranked the handle in reverse, the end nut on the crank shaft loosened, fell off and all the blades fell into the ice. Since the blades are assembled in a specific configuration I could not reassemble it. Amazon was very quick to reorder another for me..however it has been back-ordered for six weeks. Recommendation: tighten the end nut on the crankshaft before you use it."
1,not good scholarship,"Footnotes not complete, sometimes completing missing. I have had difficulty doing additional research for my thesis using this book."
1,Malcontents Have Spoken,"This is a book you will want to skip. Poorly written by an ideologue with an agenda. The worst sort of screed disguised as history. Brings to mind the ""double speak"" writings of the Chinese Communists."
5,The Stonewycke Legacy,This is the greatest book I have ever read and would recommend it to anyone with a love of God and history. The Stonewycke Legacy(2) and the Stonewycke Trilogy(1) are spiritually uplifting and really fun adventures. You'll love them!
3,interesting sound,"the ladies have a verry nice unique sound,thats hard for me to describe really.but having said that the last 4 tracks makes this whole album.those songs are just so murky,and moody.the girls has this silky smooth vocal delivery thats smooth & creamy as chocolate on those tracks.if the album had been more like those four this would be one solid album."
5,John Wilson...Gives Canada a Bad Name!,"It's a horrifying story of a man who gains to much power in the mounties and kills his wife. If your from Saskatchewan, the places in the book are all close to home and give you a sense of realism."
3,Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio,No batteries supplied. AM frequencies hard to find. Well built with good and useful properties. Could be lighter and thinner.
4,Best Shower Radio,"I've tried them all, the last one was the Sony--I thought about as good and durable as it was going to get, until this one. Better construction, better water resistant construction, better sound and much better reception. Easy to use. Looks great."
5,A great radio!,"I purchased this a month ago and I love it. I has great reception, both FM and AM. I seems to be very solidly made. I didn't rate the battery life since I haven't had it long enough, but so far so good. Assuming it keeps working well I would definitely buy another if I needed another shower radio.5/20/2011 update: It is still working great! I love it!"
4,"Great radio, problem with wall installation","This radio was all I had hoped -- good reception, good sound, nice looking, convenient controls. Only one problem, on wall installation. Radio has a fairly standard wall set-up -- plate to screw into the wall, and then the radio has prongs to insert into slots on the mounting plate. However, two-sided tape is also provided to secure the radio more firmly to the mounting plate (not sure this is really needed). I ended up letting that tape stick to the mounting plate before the radio's prongs were firmly locked into the mounting plate slots, and found it impossible get a firm lock once the tape had stuck the radio to the plate. This doesn't seem secure enough, so I'll have to pull the tape loose, scrape it off, and re-mount. Skip the tape, or be very careful to make sure the tape doesn't contact the plate before the prongs are firmly seated, and it should be no problem. Installation instructions don't warn about this. Otherwise, great radio for my purposes."
4,A very good shower radio,"This Sangean shower radio is the best shower radio I've heard. The sound/ everything is much better than a Sony shower radio (ICF-S79V) I had that lasted about five years before crapping out.I talked to the US distributor at Sangean; apparently, they make the tuner chips used by all sorts of different companies. The LCD in this unit appears to be the exact same one used by Tivoli Audio in its iSongbook, which is a good thing.While this radio is mono and doesn't sound as good as Tivoli Audio units, its very good for a shower radio. The only (marginally negligible) think I'd complain about is the time and radio station aren't displayed at the same time when its on, even though there are two numerical LCD lines in the display. Also, there's no 1/8"" aux-input, but I guess my shower ain't exactly where I'd take my iPod anyways."
3,Light didn't work right out of the box....otherwise great radio,"I purchased this radio based on the positive reviews. And was quite pleased with it's performance and features when I received it. The ONLY problem I've had is that the light does not work. At all. Right out of the box two days ago.This makes me wonder how long the rest of the functions will, well, function. I'd say Sangeon has a great product but perhaps their quality control isn't so great."
3,Whoops,I had to return this because I wanted a radio for my bathroom but this is the size of a hardcover book. So if you are looking for a nice smallish sonically splenderous radio this aint' it kids. This would work better in a kitchen or a rather large bathroom because you will need some shelf space of it.
4,Works great!,Works great! Reception is clear for most stations. Have tried other radios which were disappointing. We've been enjoying this for a month now. BF loves NPR and now he can listen in the a.m.
4,Death By Sexy DVD,"This DVD is a must if your a Queens of the Stone Age or Eagles of Death Metal fan! Personally its a good dvd to watch if your having a few friends around and having a few drinks including a few other music DVD's.This DVD gives the background to the Death by Sexy album and what kind of production that went into it. I really like the DVD as you can see the fun they have producing the tracks, the only thing i didnt like was the CGI that liam lynch (director) has added, ok i know it was for fun/joke but still a little more effort could have made this so much better!Overall its a must as you get several extras including official music videos, Solid Gold! Great video. Buy it and enjoy it!"
3,Won't Work on New Versions of Windows,"I loved using the product when I had Windows XP, but when I went to Windows 7 it wouldn't work. It seems that few if any electronic dictionaries are compatible with the new version, and that's a shame because it's a hassle looking up meanings of words on the Internet and can be expensive when you use some of the sites."
2,Not in a useful size,"As Slothrop said, this jigger is not in a useful size.I think the most useful size is 1 fl. oz. on one end, and 1-1/2 fl. oz. on the other head. With a jigger of this size, 3/4 and 1-1/4 fl. oz. can be easily ""measured"" by underfilling, and 1/2 fl. oz. is always easy to measure with a tablespoon.If you are looking for your first jigger, I recommend you to look around for a 1 and 1-1/2 oz jigger while reviewing the recipes for your favourite drinks."
4,Very good quality for the money,"I wish it had more storage capacity.The controls are fantastically easy to figure out and use right away.Convenient lock switch to keep you from bumping a button accidently during playback.Runs on a single AA battery, not sure if I'll get the battery life they have promised but so far so good.Ease of use is definately 5 stars, the software fits the controls well. Connect to puter with a USB cable and the unit shows up as a folder, couldn't be easier to manage content.Sounds great plugged into some powerered speakers!Would be 5 stars if it was at least 20GB at this price."
1,Metrokane OJ squeezer piece of junk!,"I was sorely disappointed with the Metrokane juicer. Although it was advertised as having chrome construction, it was actually chrome shell over a plastic interior. It did not work smoothly when the lever was lifted and lowered in preparing to juice an orange. The price in excess of $50.00 is outrageous for this piece of junk which should not cost more than $5.00 plus free shipping."
1,This is a piece of junk,"We bought this hoping that it would be a great, small, hand-driven juicer. It hardly worked... you couldn't get enough leverage to squeeze the orange. It was tinny and it felt as though you would break the handle off if you squeezed hard enough to get any juice. We cleaned it up and returned it immediately."
4,Lush!,"This is the kind of CD you play in the car for weeks. It's all the lush, romantic oldies arranged by John Williams, the master of film music."
1,"Cheap quality, but works","The data cable connection to the phone is too wide. It makes it very difficult to plug into the phone. It does work though once you are able to plug up to the phone. You may have to wiggly it some to get a good connection as the first several times I tried to connect my phone to the computer, it failed. But I did finally get it to work.Have not used the CD driver/software.Overall, you get what you pay for. I don't plan on having to use this very much and I didn't want to pay $30 for the OEM cable. So I got this one because it was cheap."
3,It Works,"The cable is not the greatest construction, but the price is right and it works. I have had mine for 6 months and I carry it around with me to charge the phone when I forget the power plug but have the laptop. Still works fine."
1,Not what was described...,"See the picture? The cable in the red box with the mini CD next to it. Well that's what I was expecting, but that's not what I got. Instead, I got just the cable, shipped in a lightly bubblewraped envelope. No CD. I had to spend almost an hour trying to find the right driver. Unless you know where to get the drivers readily, do not buy this product."
4,Works as charger,Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine. The cable I received also charges the phone (VX8300 from Verizon).
2,Does not work with Vista,It does not say if and what systems it works with so I assumed that it would would work with Vista but I get a message saying compatability issues and does not accept the software.
5,A sensitive subject beautifully handled.,"My own children have gone through the pain of having names not considered ""American."" They loved this book and it helped my youngest, age 8, to deal with her feelings of exclusion based upon having an Indian name. What made the book special was the hopeful and realistic resolution to the story. It helped my daughter a lot. This is a book that deserves much greater recognition."
4,Very Nice Message,"This book, featuring a South Asian Indian-American boy, nicely captured feelings about an unusual name and trying to fit in. The multicultural aspect and the words of advice from an African-Ameican teacher were a nice message. It was a little long for the kindergarten set, but when I read it to my son's class, it sparked a nice discussion with the children eagerly talking about their names. This book should be in every school or daycare library!"
4,Flirting with Pete,The plot throughout was well thought out and interesting. It kept you interested in reading more and more. This is a ladies book in my opinion and a good read.
5,Wow!,"Unlike the other reviewers, I will be brief. Great book - two stories blended together into one unforgetable read! Barbara Delinsky never ceases to amaze me with her different story lines that always touch my heart. This one won't disappoint her fans."
1,slow and repetitive,"This was a difficult read and I admit, was unable to finish the book. The story was slow and repetitive. To sum it up in one word... boring."
2,Where is Marcus?,"I made this purchase to read about the interesting story of this super blessed young man, as well as his journey to the big time, only to be force fed constant updates regarding Pete the dog- Lord rest his soul! At times I felt I knew more about Pete than Marcus. The history lesson on Mississippi should most likely have been about two hundred pages shorter, otherwise a fair read !!"
4,Beautiful imagery and meaning,"While most people remember Blake for ""Tyger, tyger, burning bright"" and ""Little Lamb, who made thee?"" his other poems are wonderful as well. The point of the poems doesn't seem to be that aging brings experience, but that experience changes innocence, to some degree. For instance, the Chimney Sweep is about children who work as chimney sweeps but dream of heaven. Many of the poems have symbolic and religious meanings. The imagery is beautiful and poignant. I recommend Blake's poems to people who appreciate meaning and depth in poetry."
4,Excellent book especially on variations,"Obviously this book is now slightly out of date, regarding new releases in the latter half of 97 and 98. However, that does not diminish the absolute wealth of information available on the early Beanie Babies and the history of the designs.Aimed at the serious collector, rather than children, this book is very valuable in telling you what to look out for when buying retired Beanies, and what to look for when buying new that may be collectable later.Look out for the next edition too!!"
2,A frustrating experience,"The idea behind this game is great, the problem is the eyetoy camera is simply not ready for the concept. Even if you have ideal lighting and space in the room w/ your PS2, there will be many times that your score is affected by the camera not registering hits. Some game modes work fairly well but some, like the aerobics section, fail miserably. I can't tell you how irritating it is when you're punching an orb ten times and it won't register a hit and the lighting in the room is perfect and there's no furniture in the background. Hopefully they'll come out w/ a better eyetoy camera if they make future versions of this game. It's simply too frustrating to stick w/ any kind of exercise program on here and I lost interest after a week."
5,much better than Nature Baby Wipes,"Tried Nature Baby wipes but these are SO much easier to get out of the packaging which counts when you have a squirming, dirty baby. Wipes on the bottom get very wet and drippy, but I sometimes store the container upsidedown to help this."
2,Least Enjoyable of the Andy Hardy Movies.,"Classic yarn of high school boy falls for teacher. I have seen all the Andy Hardy movies and this one ranks as the lowest in the series. If you are a fan of the series you can tolerate it just to see Mickey Rooney and Lewis Stone in action, otherwise look elsewhere."
2,Dumb escapist cliche,"But, then that's what I was looking for in a weekend rental. But to own it? This one will just gather dust on the shelf.Segal is Segal in this movie. If you like him, you'll like the movie. And it has some nice cinematography of the wide open Montana spaces.But after the initial setup, the politically correct script is painfully obvious and cliche ridden. You'll forget the film before the credits scroll to the top of the screen.L.Q. Jones does a nice job as Segal's buddy Frank (but Segal sure doesn't miss him when he's gone). And Camilla Belle does a charming job as his daughter.This is assembly-line produced mind-candy but we Americans eat this kind of junk up. :-)"
4,Good film,"Thought this was a good film, but didn't have the regular action moves that I am custom to watching. Still a good film."
5,It was a nice change of pace,I saw the patriot and was more than please with what the story was trying to get across. I have been watching Steven Seagal since he started his own acting and I must say I do not want him to wind up like Van Damme or Chuck Norris who can't do nything but action this was a nice change and I must say the story was great kepp puting them out I will watch them.
4,Good plot.....,"The movie itself had a decent plot. Unlike many of Segal's other movies, something seemed to be missing though. I would recommend it in that it was a step out of most of his movies that have so much violence."
4,This does the trick!,"Low tech and very easy to use. It's great to have a reliable way to re-close the champagne bottle and retain the precious bubbles. As a result, we drink my favorite beverage more often, as opposed to the times when we know we can kill a whole bottle!"
2,Rubbadubbers DVD,"This product is good because my kids love the movie--however, I felt ripped off when I noticed all four movies are a two sided disc--too hard for my son to flip the movie--and you know how kids want to do it by themselves! The movie won't last long!"
1,Low quality product,"I made two cuts with this product before it broke. The mechanism are made of small cheap plastic parts. The description says it will cut through 10 sheet, but it won't even come close. I was hoping to be able to cut through cardstock, but no way."
5,More isnt always best,"I bought this game new. Even last night I still play it from time to time. Love RTS by Blizzard. But this game is simple, fun, sound effects great, and most of all, FUN!!! It's a keeper. Only draw back is lack of makeing up new maps and lack of expantion packs. No battlenet kind of web sight for multiplayer so I'm left to play alone but never bored. If you get, you wont be disappointed."
2,terrible performance for the price,"was looking for a small and compact fan for air circ in a boat cabin,, this did NOT fit the bill...40.00 is way too much for this fan which should be labeled a toy...the air output is minimal at best. I unfort missed the time needed to return this item and hope to save someone else from making the same mistake. I would def NOT recommend this fan for anything."
4,Like a badder (old) Bad Company,"Sometimes in this day and age after listening to all this dance and hip hop stuff, you are in the mood for a good old rock -n- roll record. Now don't get me wrong, I like a lot of dance and rap, but sometimes I just want to hear four guys who can really jam out doing just that.This album is pure, great bluesy rock. Just a couple of mikes, some instruments, and some amps. The instruments are superbly balanced in the mix, making the guitars come through clear but still being able to hear the bottom end of the drums and bass. The lines are based in the blues, but with a whole lot of rock thrown in. Certainly reminiscant of Bad Company in their heyday, but with a bit of a heavier sound.This is a great straight ahead rock album. This is the type of band you'd go see and there would be no fancy clothes, no half dressed chicks dancing on stage, just a bunch of guys in jeans and t-shirts with some Marshalls and their instruments. They'd plug in and they'd blow you away."
3,"Okay if required, but","The Anton book appears to be the standard in teaching undergrad LA, but I personally didn't like it very much. Part of the problem is due to several misprints in the early chapters. Some of the definitions of basic concepts are confusing at best, wrong at the worst. I found myself relying on the Hubbard-Hubbard ""Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms"" to get through the course. The explanations were more concise and easier to understand. If you're teaching yourself, Hubbard-Hubbard is the way to go."
4,Good value,"I read the reviews, and bought this blender anyway. I have used it several times and it has done everything the box said it would. I followed the directions on the Bacardi frozen daquiri mix and the drink was great. I let the blender go a little longer and all the ice was crushed very well. The only thing I have to do is remember to make sure the collar is tight on the jar. Hamilton Beach products are all over my kitchen, my mother's kitchen and any kitchen I have ever been in. It's a great blender from a great company."
1,World War 2 Sniper,"WW2 Sniper is among the sorry games. It needs to be totally reprogrammed to have action that flows well. To many times it cuts away claiming you failed to support the allies, or some other message like that. It could be a good game if they would get the bugs out of it. I do not reccomend this game."
3,Less is more . . . .,"I bought this wonderful composition as an aid to Tong Len meditation; the message of Pema Chodron is wonderful, however, the meditation explanations are overly detailed and repetitive. In this case, less words would be more."
5,definative is exactly what it is,"I've bought quite a lot of books, some better than others, this one has it's position right next to my work computer. I cannot remember everything, and this book provides an excellent source of reference, as even now although I've read it many times and understand the concepts, the finer points sometimes need completion. This reference section covers just about everything. - I'd give it a ""must have""."
4,Are you experienced programmers ?,"Excellent book for experienced programmers, but if you don't have any programming experience, this book will drive you away.This book has a lot explanations on conceptually theories but very lack of hands on examples.If you want to learn how to use Flash effectively and fast, this is not the book.If you want to take it to the next step (which will be a tiny step compared to what flash can already do without action script), then this book is excellent as it teach a lot of the basic and has a lot of reference.I am lucky I am an experienced programmer, so I give it 5/5, but if I am not an experienced programmer, I will give it 1/5 only.Experiened programmer, I mean if you know any of the VB, C++, or Java."
2,Good reference book but not many examples,"As an experienced programmer, I love to see a lot of coding examples besides the language reference. This book spends some time explaining concepts of programming in general and object oriented programming. Then the author describes actionscript in a halting pattern with a few lines to explain.To reiterate, this is not a ""bad"" book. Its going to be on my shelf as a language reference but I have to search for another book that provides some extensive examples.Anjan"
5,Definitive is an understatement.,"Another excellent book for anyone using Flash. Unlike many Flash books the author is not trying to be clever and impress us with his tricks and techniques (often called, ""real life projects""). Instead he is genuinly trying to document and explain ActionScript in a methodical and structured way.For many, ActionScript would be unfathomable without this book. I have two copies, one at home, one at work. I just wish I had more time to read them."
1,Digraceful quality.,All of these episodes have a disgraceful quality. They have terrible sound and pictures. None of the episodes are crisp and clear. They are in bad condition. They also look like they were copied off a VHS tape. The rarity episode 'Knife of the Party' had a 1 second tracking problem. I am a big stooge fan. So take it from me. Don't buy this DVD. Buy the Columbia DVDs instead. They have better quality.
2,"THIS DVD IS MEDIOCRE, AT BEST","this DVD turned out to be a huge dissapointment for me. The only shorts on it are their 4 public domain shorts, and the quality of them is pretty bad. Also, Curly is only in one of them. The only good thing about it is a kinescope of a 1950 apearence they made on the ""Camel Comedy Caravan"", an early variety show hosted by Ed Wynn. And, they show the entire program, not just the scenes with the stooges. So, if you're also interested in early TV shows (like I am) then you might want to buy this DVD for that."
1,Waste of Money,"Lindeburg's books did not help on the PE one bit. I know the questions are different every time, blah, blah, blah - but these books aren't EVEN CLOSE to helping you solve the exam questions. They might as well be written for a different exam. If you want a book that wastes your time; buy Lindeburg"
1,The G.I. Diet,"What does this book offer that we don't already know? Low calorie, low fat, low carbs moderate dairy and moderate protien (about a 1/4 of a plate or, say, the size of a deck of cards)will result in weight loss. Who is paying to hear this again?"
5,Good guide,"I have the Kindle version. The colors are an issue, but I can figure them out. My son is color blind and he also can figure out the meanings. I plan to put this guide to use for my New Years resolution!"
4,Pretty good and pretty easy to do.,"I was surprised to find this book really let me make some great changes that were easy and adaptable to my hectic lifestyle. This is a great book and the tips are fantastic!I liked the simplistic approach this diet has. It isn't so hard and complicated. I'm going to try it for about a month just because the book was really easy to understand, unlike a lot of other diet books.[...]"
2,Emperor's new clothes,"I'm genuinely baffled anyone likes this - it's like the end of a long, tired improv session, when all the good ideas have been beaten into the ground, and the two annoying members of the group are still carrying on with their characters that just aren't funny, at all.Fred Armisen is a great comedian, and Carrie Brownstein is a great musician, but neither of them are any good at this."
1,A paperweight not a can opener,"It looks like you either love it or hate it. Well, of all the consumer items I've purchased during the past 20 years, this is the worst. It just doesn't do one simple thing, open cans. Oh, it might open one out of five and that is generous. I always keep my handy dandy hand opener which I bought for $4.95 at the market handy.Do you get the point? Don't buy this, it is awful!"
5,No more sharp edges,This can opener is really great. No more sharp edges to cut your fingers. I can open any size can and it goes around it really smooth. I think maybe one time with a square can it did get stuck. But I would give this a big 5 star. Love it.
4,I like it,"Yes the software is not the easiest to work with, but the other features ""take the cake"". I have teamed up my 20 gb gigabeat with a set of shure e2c headphones. I am pleased with the results, I operate heavy equipment so music has been out of the question. The sound isolating e2c set and the srs wow feature make it possible to listen to tunes at well under half volume. This allows me to whistle while I work."
4,Flawed but exhaustive study of punk...,"This set is a lot of bang for the buck. About 300 mostly forgotten songs on twenty jam-packed CD's. But the sound quality is very poor. It sounds better on bad stereo equipment. Maybe that's ideal for any punk set. The booklet is sketchy and contains no information beyond song titles. I even wonder if the company that put this out legally licensed all this music. That said, I have it at my office and it's cool listening."
5,Fantastic!,Saw an old movie where a club singer sang Drum Boogie and I had to have it. You will not be disappointed if you like big band.
4,Not Bad For The Classroom,"Holt published this as an add-on for their Middle-Grades Science textbook series. Stories are devided into physical sciences, life sciences, and earth science.You have classic Bradbury with ""All Summer In A Day"" and ""There Will Come Soft Rains. Also Arthur Clarke's ""The Sentinal"". kids respond well to Bisson's ""They're Made Out Of Meat"" and Watt-Evans ""Why I Left Harry's All-Night Hamburgers""; Sanders' ""The Anatomy Lesson"" is also good fun.Two old ASTOUNDING pulp stories, Stanley Weinbaum's ""Mad Moon"" and Clifford Simak's ""Desertion"" hold up really well after all these years, and modern students still respond well to them."
2,definitely not for beginners,"Perhaps someone more advanced would have a different opinion, but as a person fairly new to yoga, I cannot recommend this program.Aside from the fact that many of the moves are just plain impossible for a novice, there are other faults: The directions are very limited, the breath pattern that he seems to follow just doesn't seem realistic or at least even and steady, and I don't enjoy having to sit through or FF through 7 minutes of him showing off at the beginning of the dvd. And as the other reviews stated, there are no chapters, so we've basically paid for a dvd with all the limitations of a vhs tape. I think this one will be collecting some dust on my shelf."
3,Cooks really fast,"First let me say that this crock pot is a huge improvement from my previous 3 quart model. I now have a family of seven and was looking for a slow cooker that was much bigger. My older crock pot cooked very slowly and a roast and potatoes would take an entire day to cook.I have only used this cooker on the low setting. The liquid is actually rapidly bubbling on this setting. Meals that are supposed to take 8 to 10 hours to cook are done in 5 hours. I would be leary to start something on low and leave it for the whole day planning on a meal after work. I think it would be done before that.I do like the idea that if I don't have the time to put something on in the morning, I can still do it in the early afternoon and have the meal ready by dinner time. I also like this portability of this slow cooker. It has a strap to fasten down the lid as well as a carrying bag. This makes it ideal to take on picnics, to family reunions, etc."
2,OK...just OK,"The first 1/3rd of the book as a real learning experience. Much to learn and many sources to check out.Then, most unfortunately, the authors began to ""sell"" their viewpoints and this effort lasted the last 2/3rds of the book.OK if you like being preached to with a bunch of unverifiable ""facts"". Not so much otherwise."
2,Not one of Blake's best,"I write reviews only when I feel readers need to be warned off inferior books. (I wish others would do the same more often.) I'm a fan of Nicholas Blake's work, but THE DREADFUL HOLLOW (while not quite dreadful) was an ultimately dreary exercise, full of so much tortuous reasoning that by the time I reached the final chapter (appropriately titled ""I Hate the Dreadful Hollow""), in which all is finally revealed, I no longer cared. Save your money on this one."
3,Premature,I have not received this magazine yet. I ordered it June 17. I can't believe it takes so long to start receiving it.
4,Big list,"This book is pretty much what everyone says it is. It is a big list of words without a ton of intuitive organization beyond general categories like elections, politics and military. The Army has always based its test and language teaching on items culled from the news, so a book like this would be very helpful for military linguists. It's probably also a decent selection of words for any student who wants to learn how to read the news. It would probably be most useful for people who are the types who like to learn a word a day, or memorize lists. It might be more useful if it were organized like a dictionary."
4,"Not perfect, but worth the money","This does have many words that you could find in the dictionary, but it also has many useful expressions that are not found in the dictionary. Every time I look through this I find a new expression that would be helpful for my speaking or writing. However, I wish it was a little better organized (maybe alphabetized) so that it would be easier to reference while reading the news."
2,"Not a reference book, and not much else.","Anyone who has spent significant time studying Arabic on their own will know that 90% of the learning materials out there are, for various reasons, not useful. Unfortunately this book ranks among the least useful of them. Its only justifiable use is for the rote memorization of terms. I bought this book as a reference for translating news articles, and foolishly assumed it would be arranged into some sort of logical order. While the forward claims that a thematic order has been imposed within the subjects of the chapters, and asserts that alphabetization ""has a negative impact on the learning of vocabulary lists.""Any decent dictionary or comprehensive vocabulary builder could replace this book in terms of content and usefulness, while offering far more to the user besides. I would not recommend purchasing this book, and will not attempt to sell it for the same reason."
1,So disappointed I had to write this review,"This is my first review ever. I truly felt compelled to write this.I've participated in one of Josh Taylor's master classes in person before and knew him to be chatty, but this DVD takes the cake. Do not buy this if you want a workout DVD. Only buy this if want a DVD which asks you to pedal while you listen to a ""motivational speech"".Josh Taylor talks sooooo much that it is distracting and annoying. He means well, but a spinning DVD is not the right venue for it. I wanted to be pushed to work out hard. I don't need a therapist want-a-be telling me to ""be all I can be"" or ""pick my motivational word"".His cue changes during the DVD are minor - basically he asks that you increase resistance slowly and spin. Stay on the saddle or get up. He leaves it up to you. I could do that on my own with some good music without having to listen to his incessant banter.It's definitely not worth the $24. Do not buy."
4,A lyrical treat,"Since this recording often falls into the avant-garde classification, I didn't have very high expectations, but Short Life really surprised me. The songs are very well written and highly interesting, and the recording as a whole tries to tell a meaningful story without bogging the listener down in the details. I found most of the songs very lyrical and melodic, and some of them are quite short, which is unusual for a jazz album of this era. This is one of those recordings I've been intent on ""experiencing"", so I don't know a lot about the musicians or the circumstances of the recording. All I know is, many sources recommend this CD to casual and serious jazz fans alike, and so do I."
2,sent it back...,way too expensive... this isn't an item that couldn't be bought at a local discount store (or even a dollar store maybe) the type of item itself is very helpful for keeping grease splatters off the stove top when frying...but this one is too small (i like it a bit bigger than the pan) and not sturdy enough (i need to be able to clean it vigorously to get the grease off).
3,Songs,"I am one of the biggest Dawson fans in the world, but I must say that I am disappointed in these DVDs. They changed all the songs in the episodes. The songs are one of the best parts of the whole show, and they ruined it. The song set the mood for the moment we were watching, and now all i can think of is how bad the song is that they chose. I still would buy these DVDs because it's Dawson, and the story is wonderful. I'm just disappointed in the songs."
5,"""I remember everything""","The tears! The drama! The excitement! How can you possibly resist all those emotions in motion during the third season of ""Dawson's Creek"".Not to mention the beginning of the most beautiful relationship ever displayed on TV: Pacey, Joey and their TRUE LOVE!The thrid season is my favorite of all the six DC seasons, for I got together with my girlfriend while we were watching #317 Cinderella Story (the one with the Pacey/Joey kiss happens to be my benchmark for my own relationship) and because I just think there are some episodes no man (or woman) can possibly resist.Except for the whole Eve thing... but nobody's perfect, right?All in all a great experience, and all ye singles out there, buy the third season, get your girl/boy of interest in front of your TV and go for it! :)"
1,music changes,"Are there going to be music changes in is dvd? I can't find any info. A lot of fans want to know before we buy this dvd? The producers are probably afriad to give out any info, after all the negative reviews season 2 got!"
1,thanks for the warning,I love season 3 so much and it is just really terrible to think that some of the key senes will have some crappy music in the background ruining it. Thanks for the warning so it doesn't have to be ruined for me too. I hope they re-release with the origional music. I wouln't mind paying the extra money at all as long as it is the same show with good picture quality.
3,Page-turning techno-thriller could use a bit more editing,"The plot, pacing, and technological premise of this novel are compelling. With a bit more finesse and precise editing, Iles could be the next Michael Crichton. I did not connect with the spiritual overtones of the story, but that may be my bias. Iles captures his settings precisely (whether North Carolina, Jerusalem, or the desert of New Mexico). Unfortunately, the only part of Asheville that he mentions is Wal-mart!"
3,Definitely NOT his best work,"I have enjoyed every novel by Greg Iles, but have no choice but to admit I was very disappointed with THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD. It started out pretty good but I found the story got boring and the characters were not the least bit interesting. Better luck next time."
4,Awesome Desert Adventure,"A good thriller and science fiction novel. Will guarantee to spoil your boredom, like mine waiting for five hours in the airport lounge.The plot mixes exciting actions along with the main protagonist's epileptic/seizure problems. Judging Greg Iles previously written and other other novels, I guess he has a medical training background, like Michael Crichton did. As most of thriller novels, eventually the doomsday has been thwarted, in the last few moments. Another predictable ending...Though a quite well-written book, it is not among the best. I give four stars for this one."
2,DON'T FOLLOW THIS PATH,"Greg Iles is one of my favorite authors of the past ten years, and while I admire his desire to ""branch out"" into another territory, I think he lost his compass on this one. What really hurts this book is it's just not entertaining. I for one am tired of the recent books including ""DaVinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"" that just have to question God as most Christians have come to know Him. Iles steps into this territory with metaphysical bullcrap and peoples it with cookie cutter characters and a slow pace, with unbelievable sequences such as the detonation of nuclear weapons. Iles intents may have been good, but what's that old saying...""the road to hell is paved with good intentions."" Stick to Iles previous novels---they are superb.NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,"""What's it all about?""","Taking on the fundamental questions of ""why are we here"" and ""who is God"" in a sci fi novel is a daunting task that Greg Iles handled reasonably well, resulting in an exciting, very readable and thought provoking novel. We all have our own ideas about these things and likely will not agree with his on all points, but he makes it interesting to rethink. The Science is a little thin but it is told in the book by an MD who is not expected to be up on the latest theories of the expanding universe. From love interest to government war secrets, to super computer, to Jesus' purpose on earth and the nature of God: it has an amazingly broad scope. Nice try, Mr. Iles!"
2,Deep????,"While a whimsical and entertaining documentation of a dive instructors travels and exploits, this text has little to do with the title or Deep diving."
2,Rapture of the Sheep,"I have been a diver for 45 years. This book isn't informative at all on the diving side and is marginally entertaining from the land-based side. Did Zinsley self-publish to get this into print? Admittedly, there are only a few good books about scuba diving. This isn't one of them. About drinking, debauch and a totally dissipated life style, perhaps I could up the rating."
5,A WONDERFULLY IRREVERENT DIVING BOOK,"This wonderfully irreverent book chronicles the adventures of one Michael G. Zinsley as he travels the world as an itinerant dive instructor. He dives, lives and loves from Bermuda to Thailand and everywhere in between. I have not dived everywhere he has but I certainly have the bars covered. I can't help but feel that some of the mainstream authors on diving have missed the boat. This hilarious rollicking book is worth far more than the asking price and belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who loves adventure for its own sake. If you are a bit prudish and perhaps even a bit snobbish as well, give this one a miss.The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass"
5,"Wonderful episode, haunting melody","I agree with everyone else - this may well be the most wonderful episode of TV drama ever. I have seen it again and again and I always love it. I am a lifelong Star Trek fan and I wanted to share a wonderful recent experience. My daughters and I went to see the National Symphony Orchestra perform ""To Boldly Go, (narrated by Leonard Nimoy)"" at Wolf Trap in Virginia, and they included the melody from ""The Inner Light"" in the program.Legions of Star Trek fans were absolutely thrilled!"
3,Run was okay for the price..,"product just broke yesterday infact,lol. the little metal round part that was stuck on the bottom popped off, still have to see if it can be fixed. I hope so."
1,Could have been A LOT better!!!,"I had a lot of high hopes for this book... but every time I got excited about something about to happen Ms. Housden would jump ahead to the next morning, or later in the day, or even days later!!! Then we were forced to RELIVE the scenes by review. I HATE THAT!!! The story had a lot going for it! I liked the passion between Maggie and Max. It really kept me guessing to see how the ending might be tied together. I didn't want to put the book down... but then I had to MAKE myself pick it up again to finish it. For a first story... I say not bad, but I expect better for the next."
5,Pentel RSVP pens,"I have used the RSVP for many years. My favorite is the medium point in VIOLET.The ink color copies and prints true. The length of the barrel gives my stoke stability when writing and is very comfortable to hold over an extended period of time.The RSVP is one of the few refillable pens available. My staff uses many different colors and different point widths, but they all agree. The RSVP is their favorite pen, and mine."
3,holy cow,"the acting is fair and the love scenes are top notch-beware of the r rated version; it cuts everything! if youve seen it, the first love scene on the car-transcends into the bedroom![which cuts that part out]"
2,Fun for the rugby fan...,"This game was a lot of fun for me, a rugby fan, but does not live up to the EA games I have grown to love. There are some flaws in the game such as the special moves system being to complicated. It also lacks the depth of most other EA games.It was lots of fun for a while but wore out quick and is not a very high quality game overall."
3,an ok book,The book was ok. Very generic information though. Not really a lot of information about the breed. Good pictures though.
3,The Ultimate? I don't think so,"They include the Merriam Webster dictionary, but it's a stripped-down verson, and unlike the encyclopedia, there's no search capability. You only get definitions. Most word-processing programs have that function, so the Websters component is worthless. The stand-alone Websters CD is a much better product. Also, the maps in the encyclopedia can't be zoomed in on, and the type is a little small. And there are no almanac-type features. There's an article about tennis, for instance, but no list of past tournament winners through the years. Maybe I've been spoiled by Encarta, which has zoom-able maps and Almanac type lists, but if Britannica wants to call itself ""ultimate"", it has a way to go."
1,Broken 4 years later,"This monitor worked great up until a few weeks ago. I started to see some horizontal lines appear at the bottom. Didn't bother me at first, but they kept coming. Now I have about a 1"" bar of colorful mess at the bottom of the monitor, and large black circles elsewhere. It just keeps getting worse and worse as the days progress. Granted this monitor did give me 4 good years of use, but still, I'd like to see these last much longer."
3,good monitor,It has worked well and appears better than my old crt monitor. I just wish you could raise and lower it but can't.
2,Not the best,"Very disappointed. My school buddy knew I was a War fan from long ago and got me this as a gift, but hate to say it. Don't waste your money. Better choices include ''Love in the Time of War,'' ''Spiritual War'' and ''All Day Music'' and any of the hit compilations."
2,"Well, it's ok I guess","First heard of it because of the corner gas theme song being on this CD. Don't get me wrong that song is really catchy, but I have heard it a billion times watching the show. The rest of it is ok for background music, but I just don't think enough of it to give it a buy it"" recommendation."
1,Oh please not another bad sign lang book!,"I have his Art of Sign book which is complete TRASH. The writer has no authority to write Sign Language books and here he comes out with a phrase book! You have got to be kidding me! In the art of sign book, he says there aren't rules to follow, now all of the sudden he found ""syntax""?!? Publishers should really check out what they are printing before it goes to print, where are the editors??? This is not the route you want to go, if you want to learn ASL. Order Signing Naturally, with the videos, and the handshapes dictionary. When you have that figured out, go to the ABC coursebook. What a waste of paper this book is, and it is a real shame that people are looking at it, memorizing it, thinking it is going to get them somewhere. Shame on you Christopher Brown for trying to pass this off as sign language. Read my review of his other book. His publishers need to find someone qualified to take his place."
5,"30"" towel bar","We ordered this towel bar because we have a small guest bathroom with very little wall space for mounting towel bars. We decided that we didn't have room for 2 towel bars, so went with a single wider bar. This 30"" towel bar is wide enough to hang 2 towels on. It looks nice and compliments the other oil-rubbed bronze fixures in the bathroom. It comes with a nice paper pattern for aid in spacing everything just right when mounting it."
3,Very Dense book with nonstandard notation,"This book appears to have all the basics for Bayesian Statistics, but the notation is very different from most statistics texts. For example, theta is usually the mean, as opposed to the standard mu, and phi is the variance, as opposed to sigma^2. It's also not a light read, although most graduate level mathematics/engineering texts arent as well."
1,Panama Cruising Guide by Eric Bauhaus,"The zydler guide was ok in its time. But the new Panama Cruising Guide by Eric Bauhaus is very, very much better than the Zydler. ALL PAGES IN COLOR, beautyful photos and nearly 200 precise charts. Dont dream of cruising panama without it."
5,Just ordered my second pair,These boots are as comfortable as they are attractive. I just ordered my second pair. I may have my first pair resoled because the upper is still in great shape.
1,This is an awful execution of a good design,"It worked well for 12 cherries, but the unlucky 13th caused it to completely fell apart. This issue is that fulcum of the three levers is only held together with a weak plastic compression connector (read this as a TRULY crappy design). If you hold the connection together, you can sort of make it, kind of work...well, no, you really can't. This is worthless."
5,Excellent,"I'm very happy with this product. It's very easy to operate & figure out. Pen writes super smooth, pencil works great & Stylus is a perfect combo. The hidden eraser is a plus too.The size is perfect and has a nice soft comfort cushion. The price is also a bargain for this pen! I don't see any reason to spend $30-100 for a fancy name brand.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great Multi-Purpose writing tool."
3,Not at all a good stylus,The tip of the stylus is to hard to use on a ipad or touch screen. Great other then that.
5,MOre than expected,"This is a great gift, I am very happy because i have me stylus , pen and pencil in one ! recommended !"
4,Nice Multipen,"The best thing i like about this pen is that it is ergonomic. Nice fat grip around the bottom. Also the ease of changing the pen from pencil to stylus. Nice attractive design, use it all the time for the stylus on my phone. Pen writes good too but i would prefer a medium point over fine. The window that lets you see what function you are using is a great addition over the other multi-pens."
2,Surprisingly expensive for this DVD of mediocrity,"I really was expecting a photographer of serious experience with the Hollywood lighting style and was very disapointed in the content, presentation and knowledge of the photographer. Although he is very amiable and seems to have a profitable local photography business, this is not a serious DVD on Hollywood lighting and is certainly not worth $50."
1,Misleading - Provide Quantity,"As someone else stated in a review, we were mislead and purchased these thinking we were getting more than one. The price is ridiculous for one, so we purchased it thinking it would be a 3 or 4 pack (especially since it got such high reviews). Needless to say, do not make financial decisions based on the thoughts of others. Go to a local store and pay $3 per, instead of paying $7-$10 here. Or, if you have that much money to waste, send it my way."
3,My dog loves it...but it seems dangerous!,"My mini dachshund absolutely loved this toy. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 45 minutes before he had started to chew off and swallow small pieces of plastic so I took it away. I will not be buying this again, I'd rather not risk impaction. If only there was something like this that lasted a long time but was completely digestible."
1,over $10 for shipping? and people buy them????,Why would someone pay $4 for this and then pay $10 to ship it? I don't understand that!
2,Good if you're dumb.,"Rather simplistic and ordinariry treatment of subject for someone who wants a shallow understanding of the subject, or who is unwilling to do the math.Hull's book is a better first course in this subject."
1,Options Strategy,Who understands a spread anyway! a BC BP is what a spread?! Whos knows? I believe it is horizontal.
3,"Keeps bread just right, but...","Keeps the bread just right. Holds my big, 2-pound loaf made with Zojirushi bread machine. Is difficult to open--needs handles or something. Is difficult to slice the bread - bread moves. Makes a big mess when you slice bread. Maybe best to use this just for storing the bread and find another way to slice the bread."
1,Bread Keeper,The item arrived with a severe break in it. It would have cost me more to return it in shipping charges than it was to purchase the item. I just ended up throwing it away. The box was not dented in anyway so the the seller really would not have known it was broken unless they had opened the box so I'm not faulting the seller.The transaction was very fast and easy. I would purchase from the seller again.
3,Purchased for the slicer.,We've been making our own bread for over a year. I'm definately not good at making consistant slices. This has made my slicing look professional. The best feature for the bread keeper is the insert!I don't like the design of the container as it's not tall enough for most of our homemade loaves and is difficult to open. There needs to be some kind of tab on it to make opening easier.
2,"Good holder, but plastic shreds off","I chose this product because of its dual functionality as a bread box and slicer. The bread box works great. It fits our homemade 1.5-lb loaves fine and just barely fits a 2-lb loaf. The holes are also just the right size to allow the breath to breath without drying out.The slicing 'rungs' are a different story. I have a sharp bread knife and was hoping the rungs would help me learn to cut straight. Well, the knife slices of small shreds of plastic from the sides and cuts into the bottom. The plastic almost always ends up on the bread."
5,Removes Darkness,"Sri Isopanisad was written thousands of years ago in the Sanskrit language of ancient India and is the most confidential of the 108 Upanishads. The eighteen jewel-like mantras of Sri Isopanisad can release us from the bleak, unsatisfying conceptions of impersonalism and bring us in touch with the primeval original Personality, who is the fountainhead of all energies.These mantras provide, along with Srila Prabhupadada's illuminating commentaries, key insights into the nature of the supreme intelligence that governs the universe. They teach us that all of ourproblem's ""war, famine, poverty, etc."" are the result of our failure to recognize the existence of a Supreme Person, who is the owner and controller of everything. And they show us how to harmonize our actions with the will of the Supreme so that we can easily overcome and eradicate all our difficulties and always live peacefully and joyfully."
5,"Whoa, mp3 available??!!?","This has been a long-time favorite of mine, and I'm glad to see that it is available again. Here are the nuts and bolts:Billy Bang-- violin, compositionsFrank Lowe-- tenor saxSirone-- bassDenis Charles -- drumsThe playing is fantastic throughout, and the tunes are about as good a collection as you can get on one album. As with everything Billy Bang does, the melodies are tinged with the blues (sometimes outright drenched!) without being beholden to anything. Everyone is in top form throughout, and there is a very beautiful reading of ""Lonnies Lament"" that will have you in tears.This is one of those albums that I recommend to anyone I meet, and I'm glad to see that you can download it now. By all means, get it!"
5,The book Doctors do not want you to read: hilarious and mostly true,"This is a classic. I first read this when I got out of grad school in the early 70's. It was given to my by some friends who were just getting out of med school in Boston. I loved it then and I love it now. Want to know some of the adventures and lack of knowing what is really going on most docs experience during their first year, two or three after medical school? then read this: written by the real thing; a young doc just finishing his internship. My PCP is a younger guy and had not had the opportunity to read the book. I purchased it mostly for him, for entertainment, levity, and to help him reminisce his younger years a a beginning physician.If you enjoy some of the inside scoop of things and you can take things lightly, then this may be your kind of fun reading over a weekend."
5,DO Review,"Excellent read for any medical student or pre-med. It gets to the heart of medicine and explores a plethra of issues in residency. At times, it is very cynical. I cried because I was laughing and sad...sometimes simultaneously. Ironically, a Dr in the ED I work in quoted one of the rules...BUN+age= lasix dose....just a few days ago. While, it is depressing and honest, there is an uplifting aspect. As the god-like physicians develop, both young and old, we see how the stages and coping mechanisms help them mature into human doctors."
1,what a waste,"Heard abt this book in our inauguration speech as I resumed for internship. CRAP! Read the reviews and I still dnt get it. What is this sick book abt. Wish I cld return the book. Found out no one in our generation has heard of it nor read it . Guess it was funny and "" the book"" back then when residency was a curse.Advice if you are a new gen resident pls dnt buy the bookwish I cld give it -1 star"
1,"Not well-written, unnecessarily alarming","This book came out in the wake of similar titles like MASH and Catch-22, and describes life as an intern at a hospital in the 1970s. I read it in 1997, and it made me very sad about the state of medicine in this country.Fortunately, reading some of the some of the location descriptions in the book, it dawned on me that the hospital in the book is Beth Israel in Boston, where I grew up.I mentioned the book and my realization to my mother, who said that back in the 1960s and 70s, Beth Israel had the reputation of being more or less a butcher shop, a good place to go if you wanted to wind up dead nice and fast, vastly different from their current positive reputation."
1,debased and disgusting,"I must say hat I had much higher hopes for the book. I enjoy reading medical based literature, since I am in medicine myself. I did all I could to get myself through the first chapter, luckily it was short. The baseness of the book was disgusting. How anyone could write of having a sexual orgy during a code, in full light of everyone in the room was beyond me. If any institution was to have anything of the sort going on I would mandate and petition for its immediate closure. The title of the book only makes the issue worse. I would recommend the book for burning, or cleaning up bird droppings, but not much more."
2,Catharsis for the disenchanted.,"As a second-year medical student, this book read more like a horror story than like a ""classic novel of life and death in an American hospital."" Filled with the cynicism and free thinking that was supposed to embody the 70's, the author's mainstay over-the-top-shocker style of writing immediately becomes dry and lifeless before the reader ever notices how poorly the characters are developed. The book could better be interpreted as an emotional outlet for someone who became disenchanted with medical training, lost their way and exercised defense mechanisms that harmed both colleagues and patients.However, the author does bring to light important issues such as how medicine is taught/learned, the sometimes grim realities behind that training and the importance of outside support vs. internal defense mechanisms in maintaining perspective on a challenging course."
4,Interesting look inside medicine...,"A fascinating look inside a doctor's year as an intern. This semi-autobiographical tale does come off as a bit dated at times, but it's influence can be felt whenever you watch an episode of St. Elsewhere, Scrubs, or even Grey's Anatomy. An interesting read that I highly recomend to anyone doing any kind of internship."
2,Dissapointing,"""The Duchess"" was such a disappointment. Despite a promising story line Bertrice Small managed to make this book almost unreadable. A good third of the book was simple explication of Georgian society that read as if she'd lifted it directly from a history book. She obviously researched the book, unfortunately the research didn't stop her from having the heroine call her father 'Pa' of all things, not to mention a host of other simple, yet distracting mistakes."
3,This is no Skye O'Malley,"I consider Beatrice Small one of my favorite romance writers. While I enjoyed ""The Duchess"" I was somewhat disappointed. The twists and turns one expects with a Small novel were not there. The storyline was weak and very predictable. However, it was certainly an easy, enjoyable read. Highly recommended for the beach or pool."
1,Not at all up to snuff!,"I simply can't believe that this book was written by Bertrice Small. It seems unfathomable. The characters are shallow and superfical as is the plot. There is no depth to this book at all. Basically it is a repetion of saying, ""the bluest blood in England marries the richest girl in England"" over and over and over! So stupid. I love many of Small's novels, but this insipid dribble is not one of them. Stay far, far away. Read Sky O'Malley, or The Kadin or pretty much any other book for the real Small."
2,"Pretty, if you can get it open","love the look and feel of this case but it has a key with it, which I am having trouble getting to unlock the case! Maybe I'm just stupid, but could anyone help me out?"
5,Garth likes them!,"My big lug of a 20 pound cat Garth has always enjoyed having a manicure. He just lays on his back in my lap and extends each claw himself. I don't know if he's smart or just lazy. We just got new carpet put in and Garth is a major scratcher and even with careful attention to nail trimming its amazing how much damage a cat can do. Now he has his new bright blue soft claws on. He seems to actually like them and very carefully grooms around them and holds them out for inspection. They have been in place an amazing 6 weeks now without a replacement! I'm sold. I think I'll get pink next time. By the way Garth wears a size large, but size large is actually QUITE large so unless you have a huge cat like Garth I would recommend the size medium."
