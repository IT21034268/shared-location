2,Different than photo,I was extremely disappointed to find that when the comic book arrived it looked completely different from the one pictured. I got this as a Christmas gift for my brother as he we interested in the illustrations and artist but it was not the same. Not sure why they have a different product pictured than the one they delivered. Should update their product info/pic and save me the hassle. The product that did arrive was in good condition though and appropriately packaged.
2,Ending out of character,"This book may be supposed to be a thriller, but it wasn't very thrilling. For someone who was supposed to be so horrible, I was left wondering when anything really terrible was going to happen. And the ending seemed to be so out of character. Without spoiling it for someone who may read it, I was very dissapointed in the ending."
3,You need 2 sets of cable connections,"We had to call the company to figure out how to make the connection work. All cables were correctly connected by us but the instruction book missed one little detail:telling us to use the source button.Then 2 days later I tried to tape. It did not work. So I called the company again and they said I needed more than 1 set of connecting cables. I did not know that.So be sure you go out and buy another ""red,yellow, white"" cable if you want to tape from your TV to your VCR.You only get one set in the box."
1,piece of junque,"I've had Samsung Recorders in the past, but this one was a disappointment. It didn't last 1 year. It was difficult to use. I'd have to go to the manual often.The display with the time would always disappear. The programming was spotty.I replaced it with a Magnavox, it's not as complicated."
3,"Sol Bianca, The Legacy - Lost Treasures","While there's nothing outstanding about this new take on the original Sol Bianca OVAs, it's not bad. As before, this is the story of the all-female treasure hunting crew of the starship Sol Bianca. The new character designs are gorgeous, the stories are straightforward, and the animation is fluid throughout the 2 episodes contained herein. The menus, which mimic the control systems of the titular starship, are among the best I've seen on any DVD and the extra features include a music video. However, the CGI was rather disappointing in more than a few scenes. Also, action fans be warned; there's more exposition here than battles. Overall, it's entertaining, but nothing special."
2,"I agree with reviewer ""Duraiel""","I agree with reviewer ""Duraiel."" I found the sound quality to be okay, but the severe editing of the music in this ""collection"" is abysmal. Nothing more than a cheap way to crowd additional titles onto the track list. Please do yourself a favor and find a different collection. This one will disappoint."
5,A great switch,"A super switch at a great value. I use essentially as a ""splitter"" so that I can have both a laptop and a network printer on my desk."
5,ethernet hub,"This stopped my problem with my wireless router kicking my hard wired connection.I had to restart both routers often.Now I have a dedicated wire to 2 bedrooms, AT&T; Micro-cell and wireless router!Better than I thought, haven't been kicked since I hooked it up.The 5 ports consists of 1 input and 4 output.I'm very pleased with this switch and highly recommend it."
4,Solid Product,"I have two. Chose them over flimsier-looking plastic switches and it seems to have been a solid choice. They do what they're supposed to, which in my case is to double the ethernet feed to hard-wire my two pairs of Dish boxes and BluRay players."
4,Great option to add ethernet ports,The problem was: I had one cat5E ethernet connection in the audio/video cabinet and 2 devices I wanted to connect to the internet. This switch was a great solution. I have a Roku and a Squeezebox duet connected through the switch and they work perfectly. I have had no problems streaming video through the Roku at the same time I'm streaming music through the Squeezebox playing on speakers in a another room. I'm very happy with this switch.
5,Solid product,"Netgear has a good reputation and history of making quality products and this is no exception. It is easy to see that they did not sacrifice quality at the cost of making a low price product. It is a simple low end switch, so don't look for features that is not what it was designed for and where the cost savings comes from."
5,Good quality air filter,"Good quality air filter, fits nicely in car. I trust the Wix brand. Offered at a reasonable price. I'm a satisfied customer."
3,"Should have been titled ""Using PERL with NT""",A little to heavy on the PERL. If you aren't ready to sit and copy PERL code out of this book then look elsewhere.
1,"35,000 BTU Universal Heater Review","I received my heater from Amazon (quick delivery) today. Poorly made (China), makes more noise than my old one, and the cord is so short (only a couple of inches) that you have to use an extension when right next to an outlet. My recommendation, try another brand."
1,I am so ashamed,That I decided to try this instead of just going and getting the frontline plus. Hmmm lets see how many bad things I can say about it. The smell is strong and will take your breath away. The ingredients in it are toxic to cats which I found out after I put it on and decided to read up on it. (I am an idiot) The cats went absolutely nuts once it was put on. It spread all down there sides and there hair was oily. I had to give the cats a bath which is what I was trying to avoid by buying the spot on to begin with. If I could give this product a negative number I would.
1,THIS IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT...,"...and I can't believe I just put it on my cats. I feel SO bad. They immediately ran around the house like maniacs, itching the back of their neck (probably because it burns!). I just read that Cinnamon Oil is a CAT REPELLANT...not only an insect REPELLANT. I've read so many reviews of this product since I put it on my cats and I'm not looking forward to the vet visits I will have to make this week because of it. I hope the hair grows back!"
2,Enough is enough...is enough!,"How many more compilations? Live and more Greatest hits on the radio volume 1 & 2,Walk away (greatest hits 1978-1980, The su-mmer collection, Donna Summer Anthology, The Dance Collection, Endless Summer, Donna Summer Greatest Hits, 20th Century master Series: Donna Summer, Live and more, Encore! and now this latestcompilation. With her talent she could delight her fans with new recording material so that by the year 2010 we can have her greatest hits volume 3. It's a shame that great singers like Do-nna Summer end up releasing two or three new songs in compilationpackages. Come on Donna, you can do better. Enough is enough!"
4,Satisfying your soul,"A cd that's satisfying,entertaining and good for your soul a throw back for those who grow up in the seventy. Get your PARTY ON!"
4,Joy to the World,"It was about what a person expects,a gentle dvd for the season. I wouldhave enjoyed more music. But agood buy."
5,Inspiring!,"Bettman makes no apologies as he delves into the psyche of Hollywood and breaks down what every fledgling director should know before swimming with the sharks. As an aspiring director, I found his book to not only take a sharp and no-nonsense look at the technical aspects of directing, but be incredibly inspiring at the same time. One can imagine Gil down in the trenches as opposed to on the lofty throne of an uber-director; making it seem possible that with the tools and perspiration, one's dreams are definitely within reach."
3,He Sees you When You're Sleeping,OK - Nothing I would want to read again. The whole series was pretty much the same. Not really interesting.
2,"Sorry folks, I love Mary H. Clark but this one is a bomb!","I know I now need to get ready for all of the unhelpful reviews but at least I'm honest! The entire time I was reading this book I was asking myself why was I reading something so stupid! These ladies took ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"" and changed it around to something so lame that I can't believe it was even published. I enjoy reading M. H. Clark because she has some nice, mild thrillers with great stories. This book was not a thriller, nor was it a great story! A lawyer is sent back to earth (to get his wings--hmmmmmmmmmm where have we heard that before?) to help a slightly sad little girl who has a great life. There, I've told you the story and you don't have to read it!"
2,"I must be some sort of a humbug, but....","Like many Mary Higgins Clark fans, I raced to the bookstore to get my annual Higgins fix....and was sorely disappointed. I just read everyone else's review, so I see I'm in the minority, but I found this less than a page turner. I put it down SEVERAL times and didn't really care that much to pick it back up except that I felt I should somehow. I thought the characters were shallow with little real motivation. The plot was contrived. The outcome was obvious. The book had none of the suspense or twists I've come to admire. Just label me Scrooge, I guess!"
1,Simply awful!!,"This video is horrible. I don't know if this guy has had any formal training at all. Everything was very basic, very basic, information. There is much better information for free on YouTube. The quality of the video itself is extremly amateurish and very poorly produced. The video quality is bad, the lighting is bad, and the audio is bad as well. It's really just some guy with a handheld camcorder talking like he knows something about filmmaking. It just seems like he might have read a book, invited some girls over, and then attempted to talk about what he read. If you know nothing about videography or filmmaking, you couldn't do much worse than this. He should be ashamed of himself for his complete lack of effort."
3,"Good book, same 'arena' as Singularity is Near crowd","The first few chapters of the book are really good, then it gets sidetracked into material not so interesting. The end of the book goes off into some interesting areas. The author always brings the topics, no matter if they went tangential, back to the common theme."
4,"Interesting look at ""hooliganism""","This novel uses the main character as a metaphor for the People's Republic of China. Lili presents China as hungry for the modern world while still trapped in its pre-Communist past. The weakness of the novel is the love story, but the look into what constitutes a slacker in China is worth the read."
4,Another disagree,I have to also disagree with those who thought this movie stunk. This was not done to be a sequel to the original which was about the most boring hour and a half I ever spent at the movies. This film was meant to entertain and boy does it deliver. I thought it was a fresh take on an urban legends and how people perceive the witch which was never seen in either movie. This is a solid stab at the modern horror movie.
1,A Good Idea ...but drowned in florid speach.,"This book is a good idea. But there is room for litterature that can tell the same in a more lively way with far fewer words. ...or can tell four time as much with the same number of pages. - The language of most of the authors is such that you wonder WHY they have chosen to say what they attempt to tell in such flowery ways. After a paragraph it's hard to remember ""What did he try to tell me now."" It's easier to think: ""Yes. I can see that you have learnt a hole lot of words, and adjectives in particular."" - I have found litterature about the same topic, put in a different language that manage to do this far better. In fact I've found public reports that with regards to the ability to convey a thought is far more readable."
3,Graphics Card,"Despite the fact that my laptop was the fastest on the line, with 3.2 GHZ, bought just for 6 months. I don't have a graphics car good enough to play it! Make sure you have that kind of money to spare for video games, or a computer with a graphics card that supports your game."
5,You will get your money's worth,"This is a great game. But consider yourself warned. Oblivion's world is so big and there are so many quests that it will give you months of game play. That's right, I said MONTHS, not hours. I suppose you could finish it faster if you don't have a full-time job, or friends, or any others interests. I bought Oblivion in Feb 2007 and I'm still not finished yet as of May 07. I've been playing PC games since they were invented and I've never gotten this kind of mileage for my money!"
2,This is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen.,"So is anyone else wondering why Bethesda posted false requirements for this game? I can't even begin how messed up this is. I give them kudos in producing an amazing title, as well as being industry leaders for the advancement of next gen games. But it shouldnt be by ripping us off. GeForce FX series? Are you kidding me? People, please, lets make them right their wrongs. Seriously, its like buying a car that they say has an engine, and then doesnt. Completly worthless. And, I can imagine the same people who are having these problems dont have the money to invest in a next gen video card, because they asumed Bethesda as a responsible corporation would assume liability for any misleadings. Anyone with me?"
3,Save Game File Corrupted,"40+ in game hours into this game, I a repeatedly save, delete previous save files, so that I do not have 50+ saved game files. The result of this: 40+ hours of my life have been spent in vain. I spent $45.00 on this game, and enjoyed it, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is incredibly fun. However, I will not support a game that causes me to lose 45 hours of my life working for a purpose that was simply...corrupted."
3,Great Game,"This game was a lot of fun, I've put so many hours into playing it. The world is rich and has many interesting people. Its worth talking to each person you encounter for their stories and occasional unique perspectives. The open ended game style allows for continous play and lots of enjoyment.The one thing that I would point out is that the game eventally gets repetitve. After a while the player finds themselves killing the same monsters over and over again. The mod community helps a lot here by altering the game play, but at that point its almost a different game."
5,Amazing game,I've been following the Elder Scroll's games for a few years now and am in love. This game is fantastic. The product was received promptly with no damage to the packaging or product itself. Definitely will consider ordering through this company in the future.
2,what's all the hype?,"This game is getting generally great reviews... what the hell for? The interface is super clunky, you have to open three menus to change spells! The game play is weak. Even the graphics are way over hyped. I played on the highest settings and didn't think the graphics were better than any other new game.In addition, it is more a fps than a rpg. 1st person pov the whole time.I couldn't play it all the way through. I put in ten hours and then uninstalled it."
2,Wish I could have played it....,"It won't run on my brand-new laptop (literally just bought it today!), because the video card isn't supported. Very frustrating, though it was my fault for buying it without checking that out first.Before you waste the money, make sure your hardware is supported."
2,The book was alright,"I thought the book was alright. I've read better Gnostic writings but it was generally an interesting read. I don't like the way the author attacks other religions, I think if he were a true Gnostic he would understand that we all come to know God in our own way, in our own time and when we attack other religions, we are in essence, attacking our own character. I give it two stars."
1,Absolute crap. Doesn't stand up.,How do you make a mic stand that doesn't... stand? Maybe they should rename this mic limp. Because that's what it does. It limps over. I bought this brand new. Just mounted it. Put a Shure SM58 on it. And (cue sad violins) wah wah wahhhhh.... limp.Piece of junk. Don't buy.
5,Very nice book ends,"I've had these for over a month now. I use them to hold up big hard cover picture books, and they do it very well. They have felt/rubber type material on the bottom also so you don't need to worry about scratching. The only super-picky think I can think about is that on the very bottom of the wall the men are holding up is the name of the makers of the bookends etched in. But that's it. They do their job well."
5,Awesome,"These things are great. They look amazing on my bookshelf and they made with solid material and heavy enough to hold up all my college textbooks. In my mind, they are totally worth every cent. If you like how it looks on the picture, I say go for it!"
1,Michael McShane's Narration Stinks,Others have written reviews of the book. I'll keep my comments to the narration. Michael McShane's performance is TERRIBLE. He constantly sounds out of breathe. His cadence is wooden. His Spanish pronunciation is terrible. His accents are atrocious.Please get a new narrator for the next Dale Brown book - hopefully this one will be better!
1,Edge of battle,"I consider this to be a very poor example of an author writing for the purpose of ripping off the public. It is banal to say the least, meandering from plot to plot with a verbose writing style. Definitely will not be buying any more of these types of books extremely dissapointing."
1,Dangerous baloney,"Brown starts with an argument, from a character who's a bully, that the western US was taken nefariously, therefore the illegal aliens have a right to invade the country. Let's give Alaska back to the Russians! With the way his books have gone down hill, from not much height to begin with, no wonder he has some one else writing them now! Maybe the new guy will be better!"
2,This is not one of Dale's better books,"Dale has written some good books like, Battle Born, Silver Tower, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point.This was not very good."
4,Rockabilly Must Have!,"Not much origional material here..Robert covers the rockabilly classics with his own spin. Great guitar work from Link Wray, and also a cut or two with the legendary Danny Gatton on lead guitar! (make sure you read the liner notes!) This album is a must have for rockabilly fans!"
5,Great Insight into Real Estate Investing ...,"Bergsman's book provides a great ""behind the scenes"" look at some of the biggest names in Real Estate in this country and how they succeeded (and failed) based on how they crafted their deals. While not all of us will be (or want to be) Donald Trump et al, one can't help but appreciate reading how each got started, their principles of doing business, and their unique philosophies when it comes to investing in Real Estate. I found many of their strategies very relevant - whether one invests in a single condo or large multi-unit apartment complexes. The book is easy to read, worth reading .... and full of valuable tips and insights to the world of real estate investing - large and small."
2,Not about RE investing strategies; also not biographies of great RE investors,"I am disappointed about this book. As many reviewers have pointed out, this book, unlike its subtitle suggests, is not really about strategies of RE investing. Many said this book is more like biographies of great RE investors, but I find it difficult to agree as its analysis (or, even chronicle) on each ""maverick"" is always skin-deep.What this book serves to me is that it tells me ""there are such successful RE investors in the world as Zell, Shorenstein, Reichmann, and if you want to know more about them, you better look for a better biography in the library (and I am not going to tell you which one is good or where you can find one.)"""
3,"Looks great, but function is not great","I can't lie, it's a great looking tape dispenser. It feels pretty weighty, which I like. But, there was a review earlier that I completely agree with:""Designed for aesthetics, poor on function. Nice weight but the acrylic tabs protrude too far it prevents the thumb from getting close to the blade for quick cuts. 'took the acrylic glass and now functions well.""This is totally true, if you really tape a lot of things, you may want to buy something else, because the tape doesn't rip off this easily because of the protruding tabs. A few times now I have ended up with half a foot of tape because it didn't cut."
2,If you fancy looks more than efficiency...,"Designed for aesthetics, poor on function. Nice weight but the acrylic tabs protrude too far it prevents the thumb from getting close to the blade for quick cuts. 'took the acrylic glass and now functions well. The decorative glass probably costs half the total price."
5,Perfect for Fuschia,"I purchased this bracket to hang a mature fuchsia plant on my back porch and it's worked out perfectly: it allows plenty of room for the basket and the trailing stems of the plant and was easy to mount. I even found I can use the second smaller loop to hang a hummingbird feeder! Since it does hang the plant close to the house, I find I need to turn the plant every few weeks to achieve equal sun exposure, but this would be true with any similar bracket set-up. Great product in quality and functionality."
4,Definitely not C++ for Dummies,"C++ has reached maturity and still doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. This makes C++ both difficult and rewarding. One can approach C++ as a medium for expressing programs, but the richer rewards come when C++ is approached as a medium for expressing design.C++ Gems is an admirable collection of papers by masters of the art of balancing design against pragmatism. For those who want a comforting guiding voice, Koenig's ""Ruminations on C++"" is probably a better choice. But for those who want to cut a wide swath over all that C++ offers, at the level where each advance poses as poses as many problems as it solves, C++ Gems is hard to beat.<P"
1,Not recommended,"We bought this stove to replace our old well-used Camp Chef that finally, after about 15 years of hard use rusted out. We used the new one for about two weeks when the regulator began malfunctioning. We finally had to replace it last week, after less than a month. The safety device in the unit itself causes the gas pressure to throttle back to the point where it is impossible to maintain a cooking flame and the least breeze will shut down the flame as well. We did all our canning and barbecuing on the old Camp Chef, never had any of these problems. Can't make hot dogs on this one, much less pressure can."
2,mediocre chop-sockey flick,"The cover says more action than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Yeah right, this [stank]. DVD quality bad, special effects [stink], and the swordplay [stink]. My advise, overlook this one and get some Bridgette Lin flicks.The renegade lives!"
4,Love it,"I enjoyed the book very much because author use his point of view to describe his journey through his students, friends and travel through out the China abut the feeling toward past, today and the future of China."
5,Great Book,"One of the best books I have read in recent years. The book is very well written and the stories are very interesting. If you have some knowledge on Chinese history, you will appreciate this book even more; otherwise, you will have trouble understand certain things, but the modern-day narrative should keep you busy enough. A great book to learn about China's past and the present."
2,"Phony Set, not the real stuff.","My VHS copies play better than this dvd set, wanna know why? Because my VHS copies are the 'offical' copies from Pioneer entertainment. This set of DVDs are bootleg phony copies. Even two of them have the 'same' misprinted cover rofl. Ridiculous. This was probably released from somebody who wanted to make a quick cash sceme. Could'nt fool a real fan, I want a refund!"
3,Big Book of Quick Rotary Cutter Blocks,The book I ordered was delivered in a timely manner and was as good as it was represented to be.
3,Good but Repetitive,"This is a good book if you don't have anything of Pam's before. However it is just two of her previous books, which I already had, combined into one. I didn't realize that until I had purchased the book. It does have some of her best designs though."
2,Save your money,"I have been involved with UFO study since 1979. This DVD is a big disapointment. The narration and editing are poor. Save your money and buy some legit UFO material with it. This can be considered a 2 disc ""flop-o-rama"". Embarassing."
4,Good movie,This is a really good movie. Love period stories - getting a look into a time gone by. Not only is the story good the picture is wonderful to watch - the color is so vibrant in this movie.
1,The Yearling film,"The movie is incredibly dated now but the score,derived from the music of Frederic Delius, is outstanding. Rawlings, the author of the book upon which the movie is based, and Delius lived in the same section of Florida. Both capture the special atmosphere of the place. It is a remarkable union of screenplay and music. The performance of the boy, Jody, will wear you down with his unremitting wide-eyed wonder. As a movie, I rate it one star, but it has the redeeming virtue mentioned above for those who can enjoy atmosphere aside from the plot."
4,GREAT POSTER,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT TWO PRETTY GIRLS KISSING THAT IS SO APPEALING BUT THERE IS NO DENYING IT, THIS POSTER IS VERY SEXY BUT ISN'T SLEAZYRAZORBACK FAN"
4,Terrific Techno Terms,There are two groups of people who already know this information: Ph.D. students and the arrogant people who answer computer help line numbers; it's news to the rest of us. I am a Masters student in Library Science and found this book to be of great assistance in completing a very difficult project. This dictionary includes a number of graphs and formulas to help the reader visualize the concept at hand. My copy is already dog-eared.
3,"Was not what I thought it would be, but my mom liked it.","Was not what I thought it would be, but my mom liked it. The holocaust part was interesting to me as someone that considers history one of my hobbies."
4,Another great item on Amazon grocery line,These coconut chips worked great for the many items I was making for Christmas boxes. I found them moist and large size flakes of coconut. Good price.
2,Melissa's dried coconut chips,I didn't care for the coconut chips. The coconut taste was not as I had hoped. It was much too dry also. I did not use it in baking or other types of cooking; only right out of the bag.
1,just a curiosity about it (disregard the stars system),"This novel is mentioned in Dashiell Hammett's story ""The Gutting of Couffignal,"" in Hammett's postumous collection _The Big Knockover_ (1962). The master of detective fiction has one anonymous detective of the Continental Op. Agency reading the book for a long of night of guarding wedding presents in the island of Couffignal. ""The book was called _The Lord of the Sea_,"" Hammett wrote, ""and had to do with a stong, tough and violent fellow named Hogarth, whose modest plan was to hold the world in one hand. There were plots and counterplots, kidnapings, murders, prisonbreakings, forgeries and burglaries, diamonds large as hats and floating forts larger than Couffignal. It sounds dizzy here, but in the book it was as real as a dime."" To call this scientific romance ""as real as a dime"" sounds flattering enough for me."
1,Annoying,"Why on earth did W-N decide to print these on one side with a lines for an address and a dumb box over which to paste a stamp? Every artist enjoys doing artwork and we can put the address and stamps where we want them to go. Waste of money-- use Cotman's little book that is like 4"" X 6"" and make your owns darned post cards!"
3,A struggling Salome and dull conducting,"Bryn Terfel is an outstanding Jokanaan, but in other respects this set is a letdown. Dohnanyi is often too cautious and refined, or simply routine. the supporting players are nothing special. The real letdown is Malfitano, who simply isnt of the stature required in a part dominated on records by Nilsson, Rysanek, behrens, Welitsch, and many other singers of greater authority."
4,Blocks are smaller than you're probably expecting.,"I've found this to be true of most HABA toys, they are smaller than they should be. These blocks are tiny and not what I was expecting, but my 2 year old still loves to play with them, so I'm not going to give it a bad review. I love knowing these blocks are safe."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"i bought this bought so I could get creative for my kids meals. But the meals in here are gross, I wouldnt even eat them!! This may as well be listed under adult cookbooks, No way would kids eat this stuff. Look elsewhere, I am returning this asap!"
3,OK but,I watched the first season on local channels and cd format this is good but many people who watch MKR never finished because of the shnocking /sick ending of part 1 and they got fed up of it
2,Very disappointed . . .,"These are great songs, but this CD has the artist re-recording them!!!!!!!! These are not originals and that is noticeable. There is a reason why this CD was cheap. Percy Sledge had a different energy when he recorded these songs originally, and unfortunately, it's just not there with these re-recordings. Buyer beware!"
3,Cool but needs more pictures to show each stage.,"I don't have the time to do any of the stuff in this book, but from two semesters of chemistry in college, most of it looks authentic. I wish he would add more chemical equations as well as visual diagrams or pictures. Also, he needs to get an editor, because his writing skills and formatting wouldn't pass highschool. A short summary of all the steps of each product would also serve as a good recipe list for someone actually making these products. Also, maybe he could add thermite, as I hear that is not illegal (not explosive) but it's destructive power as well as usefulness (some places use it for welding) would make it an excellent topic."
3,decent,"product is average. Provides a cooling sensation, does what its supposed to do. I prefer ID original lube to this product."
5,An Essential Book For Working with Actors,"I took a class many years ago from Judith Weston. She was always prepared, well-spoken and focused. Her book is the same. This book is critical in working with actors - a much underutilized skill in today's world of technology emphasis. If you want to create a great film or great media, then working with the actors and other participants is critical. They will appreciate your understanding and efforts. That will go a long way toward gaining critical performances - and recognition. Judith's book will help get you there."
3,Interesting but not practical,"The title of this book implies an offering of specific techniques for script analysis and rehearsal. However, it's really more of a general discussion on the craft. It's certainly interesting (although somewhat densely written). But I can't say it's really what I was expected. The bulk of the text reviews thoughts on acting and directing by people in the industry. I found it a bit too abstract to apply to practical filmmaking. If you dress in black and attend film school you'll probably eat this book up with a spoon, though."
2,"Cute, but does not last long.","This was actually the 3rd sock monkey that I have purchased, so I should have known better, but my little dachshund just loves them.Unfortunately, within 2 days, the stuffing comes out and I have to throw it away because I don't want the puppy to choke on it.I have now learned my lesson and just made him a substitute sock monkey out of old socks.I fill the sock with old socks, so no choking on the batting.Guess what? He loves it and it hasn't come apart."
4,Mr Bill a hit - but how to wash??,"Our pug loves Mr Bill and the funny ""oh noooo"" he makes when his tummy's pressed. He's been playing with it for a month and the toy's held up fine so far, no ripped limbs and all the seams still intact so far. Unfortunately, it's not perfect - it's encrusted with dried saliva and stinks like year old cheese. Will Mr Bill (more specifically, the speaker inside him) survive a spin in the washing machine? Stay tuned...."
3,"dogs love it, not overly durable though","I have 2 boston terriers. great pets, but boy do they have strong jaws. nearly impossible to find toys they don't destroy in just minutes. that being said, they LOVE the mr bill dolls. great for fetch, but pretty easy for them to tear into. we bought a few so we could stretch the use time a little."
2,Big squeaker broke in just a few days,"Our German Shepherd is not one to destroy toys. He loves squeakers and mostly only plays fetch. However, the main squeaker of this toy broke within 2 days. The little squeaker, on the foot, still works fine. But the main one still collapses and expands...without any noise."
1,Not worth it.,"My 4lb. 6 month old mini dachshund loves socks so I figured this would be a great toy for her. She was able to rip off it's mouth, both eyes, and make a huge hole in its head all in less than 24 hours. It definitely wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
5,"Oh No, Mr. Bill!!",Love this toy! Sturdy construction. Bought it just because we loved the character back in the old days on Saturday Night Live. Brings back lots of fun memories!
1,Lasted about an hour with a 4 lb. dog -- DO NOT BUY!,"We have lots of dog toys for our tiny 1-year-old Yorkshire Terrier. He is very easy on toys and this must be one of the worst I have ever seen. The arms and legs started coming off within 30 minutes and the stuffing was flying everywhere. We stitched the toy up with new thread, but to no avail. Absolutely worthless. DO NOT BUY!"
5,sock monkey,"Great product, too good for a dog, I always wanted a sock monkey but most are too expensive, so this little guy has a happy home with my bear collection."
5,Great toy for blind dog!,"Just got Mr. Bill, and already my dog loves it! I try to buy toys that make noise longer than a simple squeak, and Mr. Bill is terrific. Bette (the dog) pokes it with her nose until she gets the ""Oh, No......"" she tosses it, then can find it before it's finished talking. I got it an hour ago, and she's been making him talk ever since. He is a little big for a small cockapoo, but she loves it."
5,Dogs Favorite Toy,"I have no idea why, but the Waldo doll is the favorite toy of both of our dogs. We bought one at a pet shop several months ago and our dogs ""loved"" it until it was in pieces. No longer able to find one in the store I ordered a couple off Amazon. I don't know why our dogs prefer it to any other toy, I do know that I am glad I was able to find it on Amazon!"
1,Junk,Junk. Don't waste your time. The toy isn't plush and it says only hey Billllllll..... My dog has no interest in it at all
5,"AMAZING, SIMPLY AMAZING!","This DVD isn't a bunch of matches like the other ECW DVD's so if you are looking for that, buy one of the other ECW DVDs. This is more of a History. You see the end of a lot of matches (when the Dudleys won the titles on 8 different occasions) you only see a few full matches. Like D-Von and Axl Rotten Vs. Buh~Buh Ray Big Dick, and Dreamer Vs. Dudleys (with Raven comming to save the day). All in all the DVD is great. The matches that they do show are great. We even get to see the Introduction of D-Von to ECW!!!!!!! Can't wait till they make 2 more ECW DVDs"
3,OK but not their best,I am a huge almighty fan but this is not their best release actually in think its their worst effort.Better off looking at Crank if you want the best that the Almighty has to offer.
4,"Product is great, very versatile","I ordered a Therm-a-Rest for a number of reasons:1) Primarily as a meditation seat. I got the regular size, so I unfold a few sections for my knees, and use the rest for my seat. It's perfect, especially since I frequently meditate outside, and don't want to worry about getting something dirty. The Therm-a-Rest is holding it's shape nicely, no sagging so far (it's been about a month).2) As a yoga mat. Again, getting the regular size (even though I'm a small woman) is perfect, and allows me to both meditate and do yoga on the go.3) As a camping mat, which is what it was intended for.The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because BackCountry.com, who ships this product, was a bit disappointing to work with. First they shipped me the wrong product, then forgot to ship me the right product until I called again, wondering where my order was. They fixed things quickly once I spoke to them, but the lack of attention affected my opinion of them."
3,Great if it works.,"This is my first DVD player that I bought, and I was initially very happy with it....great price, great sound, great picture quality.Then about 3 1/2 months after I received it, it stopped playing discs. I took it to an authorized Toshiba service center in late October, and after a few weeks found out the broken part was on backorder until Late November (suggesting that this is a flaw not unique to my machine). I still haven't gotten it back.... Furthermore, although the parts are covered by warranty, labor is not. A little ridiculous to pay for service to a machine that is not even half a year old.My recommendation-don't buy as many people are having problems with it (look through other reviews) due to both shoddy equiptment and a dismal warranty."
1,Bad from the start,"At first the SD-2200 played DVD's but not CD's. After a week it does not recognize DVD's or CD's. I switched back to my old Panasonic and still love it. In addition, the remote control is ungainly and the controls aren't intuitive. A bad choice!"
2,BEWARE!!!,"Used this appliance many times. I don't like that the trays fall when you try to remove them, or that your pot holder burns when trying to remove a hot dish from the bottom rack. The final straw was when I reheated a casserole in a pyrex dish small enough for this oven, had it on fan & bake @ 350 for 45 mins. and the glass door BLEW out - if anyone had been standing near it they would have been badly injured. Thank goodness my grandson was not nearby! Never ever use foil on a pan to reheat. It only says to not put foil on the appliance parts in rule #24.I definitely do not recommend this product and feel it should be pulled off the shelves!DeLonghi RO2058 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven with Rotisserie"
3,Delonghi convection,This oven loses alot of heat thru the all glass door....makes the area surrounding oven hot as well. Must use potholder to open oven as the handle gets too hot to touch...racks aren't stable pull them out 1/2 way and they tip ....so I would not buy another one.
2,A disappointment for me as well,"I did not notice that the temperature knob is not well marked. The knob reads ""Keep warm, hash mark, 320, hash mark, 390, hash mark, toaster/broil"" I had to use an over thermometer to tell what the temperature was! I set it at approximately 350 on convection oven and the the oven thermometer went above 425 before I turned it down. It did not cut down on the cooking time. I am returning this product as unsatisfactory."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I owned a Delonghi before and it died of old age. I loved it and decided to get this one. 1. Description says it's red; it's black; 2. It only goes up to 390 degrees for baking; 3. The broiler pan doesn't sit on the rack; it has it's own slot. However, broiling time is greater than my last one; fat on steak never even sizzled. When you attempt to remove the broiling pan, as it isn't resting on anything, it tilts when you take it out and it could drop and injure someone, or if using a pot holder, it could catch fire; 4. I made toast and had to put it through twice and it burned part and the rest wasn't toasted. It is now being made in China and as with most things from there, it is very inferior. Too bad."
1,Terrible product!,"I was given this product as a gift and contacted DeLonghi about what a terrible product it was, but they couldn't care less. Every time I reached into this oven, I burned my hand or the pot holder set on fire. You cannot cook anything without the upper burner being on - no matter what setting you put it on. Will never buy or recommend DeLonghi again."
1,I love Netgeat products BUT...,"Skip this one Don't bother buying this until late December '00 or until you check with the support folks. They admitted a bad crystal was ""discovered"" after the product shipped and they will not have replacements for weeks (as of 11/10/00)"
1,IT works but is flaky,"I found the product easy to install, and the portability of it is nice. However, the network connection it allows is, at best, flaky. The connection often drops out, even though all indicator lights show everything is fine. Often hotswaping the device works, but sometimes it causes the laptop to lockup. I tried calling NetGear tech support but they were clueless. This could all be related to bad drivers though I have downloaded the latest, or perhaps my problem is just the unreliability of USB. I don't know, but if you ask me I say don't buy this product."
1,anything BUT Netgear,"Did not like it. tried to install it on my laptop and it just stopped working after a minute of operating. Tried to install it on my desktop too, but couldn't do it because windows crushed every time I tried."
1,Why So Cheap?,"I should have guessed. A thick and comprehensive value guide for guns that although used, was less than two bucks. Reason? It was over 10 years old and the information was not relevant for newer firearms. Would have been nice to mention that the book was out of date but then, it was less than $2."
5,WELL MADE,I can not see how anyone would not rate this 5 star as it is so well made. The only thing that disappoints me is that made in USA is not on the outside patch anymore.The inside tag still shows made in USA.
5,"An insightful, beautifuly written novel.","I happened upon Human Capital and the first thing I was intrigued by was it's colorful, sensual cover. Believe me, this book does not dissapoint. Amidon's prose is direct and yet very artistic, able to convey a range of human emotions. Not only does this book provide the reader with an amazing story and several beautifully written character studies, but it is also real food for thought, an amazing commentary on our society.I highly recommend this book, especially for more intelligent readers."
3,"Its another Tragedy album, not unlike their others.","Its another Tragedy album, not unlike their others. Still has a recording sound so bad, its almost unlistenable. The songs are pretty darn heavy though and the guitar riffs (when you can hear through the mud), are well orchestrated and quite interesting. Only real complaints are: The terrible sound. And the album is almost all slow, where as they used to be half and half. Musically, this is some really good music. And I know the crusty quality is part of their appeal, but it really doesn't do justice to the hard-to-notice musicianship."
1,not too impressed...,"It is JUST OK. Not really impressed with the stories...It is not an all time favorite, like I hoped it would be."
1,Dried Up Quickly,"Though I don't often leave reviews, I felt I needed to warn others about this 'amazing' eyeliner. I had heard great things and was excited to try it. Nearing the end of my first time trying it out, it dried up! The entire bottle was gone. I will not be buying L'Oreal eyeliner again."
1,Don't spend the money,"Okay, so let me start by saying I love l'oreal, but this product was just not good. When I first started using it, the liner would eventually run down by the end of the day. I would have to clear around my eyes like 4 thousand times a day because of thE raccoon effect. By the first week, I had to stop wearing the liner and my contacts bc of the liner making my eyes itch so bad.It was disappointing."
3,flakes off to easily,The product glides on and dries quickly but flakes off very easily. Once the product was dry I brushed on some eye shadow which rubbed off some of the eyeliner. if you even slightly rub your eye the liner rubs right off.
3,Okay but not great,"It works as advertised but the screen is still hard to read. With the back light on it's better but the numbers are broken up enough that it's sometimes hard to tell a 8 from a 3 for example. Using reading glasses help but not much. I bought this to use while traveling and if your moving around much as when traveling in a car, the screen is just to small to maintain focus. The varying intensities of light when riding down the road play off the highly reflective screen enough to drive you crazy. Sitting at home in the easy chair, it works fine. Using it is a challenge the first time so make sure you read the instructions and keep them handy.I don't find anything special about this product."
5,Great voice and orchestration and remix.,"I can listen to this 1,000 times over my lifetime and not get bored. Connery has one of the great voices of the last century and her shines here unlike any other voice for Peter and the Wolf. A+ many times over."
4,"Close to the Leslie sound. Needs more bass, however.","I recently picked up the PRO145, and with a subwoofer one of the new clonewheels like the XK1 this sounds as close to the B-3/Leslie 122 as you will get and maintain portability. Notice I said with a subwoofer! If you are playing with a bass player the subwoofer probably isn't needed, but for jazz or gospel players needing left hand bass support, this speaker breaks up in the lower register and needs the assist. I just use my powered Mackie monitor and it worked well. But it's one more thing to carry to the gig.So, I have some mixed feelings about this product. I am profoundly disappointed that a speaker promoting itself as an organ rig has insufficient bass on its own. I'm not thrilled about carrying an extra unit to the gig. On the other hand, it sounds so amazing with my clonewheel that I'm still giving 4 stars.Also, this seems very durable and surprising easy to carry or roll. Other than the high price, I haven't had any other negatives."
4,A Good Action Story!,"A good action packed novel. It was not quiet as exciting as Crossfire and Countdown. A Japanese billionaire loses his family (mother,father,wife,and child) in the atomic bomb blasts in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The billionaire,many years later starts making plans for revenge. His plans include Ernst Spranger and his lesbian sidekick(both are ex Stasi). This group of ex Stasi agents steal the components to assemble a nuclear bomb. Our hero Kirk McGarvey enters the picture and promptly disrupts the scene for the bad guys. McGarvey does battle with this group all over the globe. He also does battle with the goons who belong to the Japanese billionaire.The daughter and ex-wife of McGarvey are also kidnapped by the Stasi renegades. This just adds to the action of the book. The book finally reaches a screeching finale. You will be greatly entertained by this book."
3,"Good, but not like Bone Collector","Although I did enjoy this book, Bone Collector still remains my favorite. Stone Monkey doesn't have nearly as many surprises and twists as Deaver's usual books (not entirely a bad thing). Also, the relationship between Rhyme and Sachs doesn't develop much further that it has, although she does want something from him . . . The book reads fast (only about 420 pages) and does't seem nearly as detailed as previos efferts."
3,Same stuff won't sell for too long,"This book was a great example of Jeffery Deaver's writing. Unfortunately, I felt as though I was reading Coffin Dancer again. The plot is intriguing and while I couldn't wait for the end, I was trying to guess which character was playing the double role that is found is Deaver's other Lincoln Rhyme novels. Amelia having endometriosis is a new concept to add to the mix. I suffer from it and personally don't feel it adds anymore to the story. In this novel and the other ones since Lincoln and Amelia have become lovers, we miss when that happened and why. Sure we occassionally get a brief romance-novel worthy glimpse, but other than that how can it be love? Their affection for each other seems forced in the writing. Overall this book was a disappointment."
4,A real Deaver surprise at the end,"The Stone Monkey by Jeffery Deaver is loaded with suspense from first page until the very end you find yourself trying to figure out who the Ghost is, but this is one that can stump the guys who always figure out who done it by the second chapter. Every time you think you've got it figured out, someone gets killed and it all goes in another direction. This one has a medium pace and is easy to put down and pick back up, but the story is interesting and holds your attention. The villain has real depth and his presence whispers through the story keeping you on the lookout for a character that fits his shadowy presence. Like all Deaver's work, an enjoyable read."
2,Disappointing...,"This is the first Deaver book that I have read, or rather tried to read. It started off well and I was excited for a good read!!!! Somewhere in the middle the book bogged down and it could be just me but the character of Lincoln Rhymes annoyed me to no end! He came off as a know it all spoiled kid/puppet master!! That and the fact that the book took turns and had dialog that were unneeded and slowed things down ruined the book for me. I got 3/4 of the way through it and then put it down to finish two other books and didn't care what happened in this one! It goes with my rule this book is like 500+ pages where only 350+ are relevant and needed! I will probably read another Deaver book, but not another Lincoln Rhyme based one!"
4,good but slow,I love Jeffrey Deaver books and am now trying to catch up on all the books I have missed. This was a good read. But maybe I'm not into the immigrant theme but it didn't catch me as his other books did. It seemed it was too caught up in the explaining of the culture so much that you were lost with the book. But that will not stop me from reading all his other books. And I did learn something about the culture. Thanks Jeffrey.
2,The Stone Monkey,"I have always been an avid fan of Jeffrey Deaver but this is the second book in the Lincoln Rhyme series that has disappointed. Why is it that Deaver has to keep referring back to the setting up of his characters in the Bone Collector? It's fine if this is the first book you have read but extremely annoying when it is the fourth! I do not need to be reminded of each characters past and the reasons why they have their habits, can we not just concentrate on the story? Am I looking forward to the next in the series? I have to be honest and say NO!"
2,eurotrash,"Ugh. I really wanted to like this. Looked unlike all the B grade gay films in the US. Alas, it was French arthouse crap. In your face stuff leaving little room for imagination and no subtlety."
3,"Shallow, quick and to the point... and then?","I highly recommend this book for someone with a short attention span, little or no training in philosophy and has trouble reading in-depth material. Pretty much a short read (took about an 40 minutes) that offers introductory ideas of the very basics of apologetics with a modern theme that appeals to teenagers.I think this would be a half decent book for 12-15 year olds, maybe even some 16 year olds but that is about as high as I would go before someone would be thinking ""and then...?""The stylized text and tone of the author had me thinking he was a 20-something writing verses a 40-something year old, I will give him props for having a message that reaches the youth but I would expect more from such a book with a engaging title."
1,Jesus Christ...,"...would loathe this book. Its message is the polar opposite of the love, acceptance and forgiveness that Christ personified with His life and death.""One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, ""Of all the commandments, which is the most important? Jesus answered, `The first is, ""Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength."" The second is this, ""You shall love your neighbour as yourself."" There is no other commandment greater than these.'-- Mark 12:28-31""You shall love your neighbour as yourself"" - is it sinking in yet? Dobson and his followers are *defying Christ*, not following Him, so I do not consider them Christians."
5,Your problem may be that this is what you need,"Ryan Dobson is confrontational and quite hard-line in this book. That gets a lot of complaints in some quarters, but guess what - that's just what a large portion of his target audience needs. He is trying to shake the complacency of today's youth and get them to look at the realities of the Christian worldview. Given the rampant intolerance of the general run of society and of the Left in particular when presented with Christianity (and, as Ryan points out, the glaring inconsistencies in the secular worldview), he is quite right to use a rolled-up newspaper to the nose as a hearing aid. To get heard, you have to get their attention."
1,Shallow and irrelevant,"A thinly veiled religious sermon. I found it very interesting that there is no mention of religion on either the front or back cover.A very quick read, but if you are looking for an in depth discussion of tolerance in today's society it's a waste of time."
1,Piece of [junk],"Apparently there is no bottom for HP poor quality.No wonder Fiorina is so big fan of outsourcing.Anyway, I bought my OfficeJet 7110 from Costco. Excellent price and good looking printer. Saved a lot of spave on my desk.The printer didn't work. I've got ""Carriage Error"" no matter what I did. ..."
1,Don't Buy HP,"I used to think HP products were the top of the line but I don't think that way anymore. This is a terrible scanner, a so-so fax machine, and a pretty good printer. The downsides - scanning takes forever!!!, the document feeder sucks, and now the machine has a system failure at least once a day. The upside - decent color copies that can be enlarged and reduced. Don't buy an HP there has to be something better out there."
3,"Stir of Echoes is great, Ninth Gate sure as heck is not.","Stir of Echoes is a terrifically engrossing supernatural thriller that perfectly blends mystery, horror, and drama into one deft mix. It also boasts Kevin Bacon's best performance.The Ninth Gate, on the other hand, is a lazy motion picture that undeniably boasts strong atmosphere and intrigue, but fails to deliver upon its potential. The movie ultimately leads nowhere, a destination so unfulfilling it makes the previous two hours ten minutes a total waste."
4,JBoss Expert Guide,"This is a good book. However, I believe that the prerequisites for this book include both an *expert* level understanding of J2EE (A strong awareness of Java EE 5 would be preferred) and a very high level of understanding of JBoss itself. Plus, you'd have to want to know a whole lot about how JBoss works and why. Most of the information in this book is not needed to successfully develop on, architect for, or administer JBoss. The two audiences who will benefit the most are those who wish to contribute to JBoss and those who seek JBoss professional certification."
2,For Wes Fans only,"Other than the Wes Montgomery footage the audio is terrible. Why wasn't this re-mastered?Its worth it for the ""bonus"" of Wes in Belium but the others are just awful video transfers."
5,A Dogs View of Magic and Witchcraft,Zelazny has done it again with this book. The story is told through the eyes of the pets of known magic and witchcraft users. It is done in very everyday language and gives the reader a true feel for the value of pets even to the supernatural.
5,Fun with Jack the Ripper,"I hadn't had this much fun just reading a book in ages. The major characters include Jack the Ripper, Count Dracula, the Wolfman, Dr. Frankenstein (and his creation), Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and about half a dozen more odd souls, most of whom have animal familiars, and the whole story is told by Jack's familiar, a dog named Snuff. Zelazny mixes black humor, sometimes manic humor, and lovely writing, and the tapes, read by the author, are as comforting to listen to as a bedtime story by a dear friend."
5,A charming novel about Jack the Ripper,"One of the late Roger Zelazny's best books, THE NIGHT IN THE LONESOME OCTOBER is a charming, fun, funny and astounding work. Narrated by Jack the Ripper's dog, the novel follows Jack and a collection of historical/fictional characters on a quest to... save the world or destroy it. Gahan Wilson's illustrations perfectly complement the text"
4,A Traditional October Read,"As far as I am concerned, Zelazny wrote only one book worth reading over and over. This is it, and tonight is the night to begin reading it again. Although we won't have another Lonesome October (one with a full moon on Halloween) until 2020, it has become a tradition at our house to read a chapter of this book a day this month, as they follow the days of the month. Other reviewers have explored the plot, the characters, etc. I will say this, it is a fun way to bring a family with older children and teenagers together for an hour at night for shared reading aloud, something that is missing from modern society.Try it."
2,Not a good choice after all...,"This card works better than Linksys NP100 (has compatibility issues with other Linksys products, can you believe it?) that is I have not experienced any incompatibility with other network cards in my house with things come with the package. This card should have gotten five stars, except there is a major problem with this product - IT WILL NOT WORK with my home-made RJ-45 cables! NOTE: It will only work with the ""RJ-45"" cable that comes with it. So do be aware of what you are getting into before buying it! Get a 3Com 10/100 card is definitely the way, no incompatibility and no cabling issue."
4,"Very good in WreckDiving, Read this !","It follows another books shape of covering everything from A to Z, preparation, boat trips, equip selection and configuration, planning, diving, bends, etc etc etc, doing a step by step way to share with you a great quantity of info about wreck diving. I wreck dive, i've read it, and i found it a good book."
2,"Dull writing, lacks insight","In this day and age, after all the books that have been written on the mafia, if you're going to attempt one you should at least have an interesting perspective. This book is flimsy, superficial and dull. Rarely has criminal activity seemed so boring. Try to read it along with ""Five Families"" by Selwynn Raab and you'll outsleep Rip Van Winkle."
1,Lost my money,"I bought a package with a drill, a flash light, a power saw and a dry wall saw, a charger and two 18 v batteries. After a short while the batteries refused to hold charge , making the whole package worthless. I don't to tell you I will never buy Coleman tool ever again.It is too bad because up to then I had a good impression of coleman products."
2,Drill bits suspect,"Although the battery holds it charge quite well, I found it does not have the potential for use as a drill. Even small drill bits struggled in soft wood. The first time I used it as a screwdriver was on a 1"" wood screw. I got half way through the wood when it started slipping. The screwdriver bit that is supplied with the drill was totally chewed up. I tried another of the supplied bit and that too was destroyed in a matter of seconds. Having said that, the drill is cheap to buy and works fine as a screwdriver (as long as you use other bits and not what is supplied)It is a shame that substandard bits are supplied with a relative good tool."
2,Horrendous,Stay clear of this drill! Not enough power all around. Drill slips on the easiest of tasks and the battery doesn't last and takes hours to charge. DO NOT BUY! I'm going to get a DEWALT...
3,Good for light use.,"This light drill has been very handy when Hurricane season comes around.The batteries held up well and still have a bit left, but the charger has now given out. Near 10 years of use, but for the light use of putting up shutters it has been indispensable."
4,A great book!,"Samantha Saves the Wedding continues the story of nine-year-old Samantha Parkington, an orphan raised by her grandmother in 1904. Cornelia is marrying Samantha's uncle, Gaurd. But Cornelia's three-year-old sister, Alice, ruins her veil without realizing the terrible thing she has done. But Samantha has a plan that will save the wedding."
1,Boring!,"I bought 2 books at once b/c I was so excited to read her work based off of good reviews that I read. What a waste of time and money! I read both books to get my money's worth, but what a mistake. Boring writing, the one word sentences drove me crazy! I can't stand her writing, she sucks! Don't read her books, they are not worth the time. Awful."
2,The formula is getting stale,"Tempe Brennan is ""loaned"" to the government of Guatemala to assist in an anthropoligical dig. She gets mixed up in a present day homicide that has links back to Canada. The characters in this novel are flat. Rehashing of existing relationships is boring and the story development is very predictable. Kathy Reichs needs to try her talents at some other character line...this one is very stale and any amount of gore and scientific explanation won't help it."
4,Should I compare thee!,"I think it is about time the publishers of Ms Reichs books dropped the"" better than Cornwall ""tag in their marketing. Why you may ask? To my mind set it is a bit like saying Shakespeare is better than a Mills & Boon , they clearly are not in the same league, therefore comparison is not relevant. Grave Secrets is a ripping yarn, fast moving, witty, sexy and intricately laced. If that wasn't enough it is also very well researched, Kathy Reichs knows her stuff, and is exceptional at making it readable"
2,A Disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed the previous books in this series, but I was disappointed in ""Grave Secrets."" The story was confusing at times with too many characters and sub-plots. The writing style was flippant with too many one-liners and the on-going romance was immature and unsatisfying. I wanted more forensic detail and flowing description which I thought was missing entirely from this book. I hope the next book gets back to the basics which previously made this series so successful and a pleasure to read."
4,One of his best,"Crofts does solid work, and this--French's first appearance--is one of the best. Crofts attention to detail lends a distinct period feel to setting and character. Crofts' Death of a Train, usually and regrettably out of print, is a classic WWII anti-Nazi mystery piece and another excellent read."
5,Fabulous resource!,"I have used this book SO much over the 10 years I have lived in the area and have never been disappointed! Some guide books get you lost, some your left scratching your head as to why a particular hike was even included, and still others make you wonder why the rate difficulty levels the way they do. I know I can rely on perfect directions and trails descriptions, and revel in the many beautiful places in and out of the city this book has taken me! Favorite hiking book series!"

1,Cannot Upload ROUTES to other than Nuvi 700 or 800 Series,"Garmin compatibility guide indicates this software is compatible with a wide range of Nuvi Products. The truth is that other than for the Nuvi 700, 800 or 5000 Series, you will be unable to upload anything other than Waypoints. If you want to upload Routes, just buy one of those units and use the free utility within Mapquest. Note: After uploading the Route, you will need to go into Tools, My Data, Import Route from File.

1,These socks do not stay up over the calf!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The socks have a nice thickness but they DO NOT stay up over the calf. How irritating is that having to stop all the time to pull them up? Any bending at all and down they go.My 1 star rating (I would have given them a minus rating if I could, I am just not happy at all paying $15 for a pair of socks that do not do what I bought them for!) was only because they are thick and of good quality but I bought them to wear under winter pants to protect up to the knee from wind chill, I basically threw them into the back of the sock drawer and that is where they will stay until I eventually throw them in the trash.I have three different types of Thorlo over-the-calf socks and NOT A SINGLE PAIR stays up over the calf.Final comment; $15 for a thick pair of over-the-calf socks that fall below the knees, look for a different brand, these are terribly irritating."
3,LET'S SEE....,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST. I WANTED TO SLAP ANNETTE A FEW TIMES. AND HER FRIEND IS STILL CRAZY. WORTH A READ IF YOU RAN OUT OF ALL YOUR DRAMA FILLED BOOKS!
5,God Still Don't Like Ugly,"This is the best sequel that I have ever read.If you like God Don't Like Ugly you will love this one. This book left me with great satisfaction it will leave you wanting to know more about Rhonda,Pee Wee,Scary Mary, Annette. Annetta also didn't let what happen to her when she was a child get in her way of being happy in the end. She used it to try to help another little girl. Trust me you will not be sorry."
4,Good,"If God Don't Like Ugly left you with questions as to what happened to Annette and Rhoda, well read this one. In it, Annette comes back home and finally face her past. She ends up getting engaged, not once, but twice and finding love from a very unlikely source. Rhoda comes back into the picture and Annette wonders what to do with the friendship(or alienation)between them, all the answers and more become answered in this book. Also, you get to meet Annette's father, half sister and other siblings as well(who are half white) here as well. Enjoy"
4,Very good,This is a very good. I am hooked on the Mary Monroe books. Keep doing what you are doing Ms. Monroe.
3,Pretty Woman Redux,"Pretty Woman + Dirty Dancing x every 80s movie - the Brat Pack = Rich Girl. This movie is cliched but really fun. It is a guilty pleasure that should be indulged in every chance you get. Although it will never be a classic, it still makes me yearn for the days when movies like this were made. The 'A' list will never mention Jill Schoelen (who was excellent in When A Stanger Calls Back!) or Don Michael Paul, but they will forever be in the hearts of the few, the proud, who have seen Rich Girl."
3,Cheap,"I bought these & they were very easy to install, all the hardware was there & everything worked. However; when I tightened down the outer housings allen screw one of them just popped right through the housing with hardly any pressure. I know it was a flaw in the casting (too thin)in that spot because I had a torque wrench & none of the others had that happen. Now my wifes Trooper has a hole in the hub for water to enter so I will have to inspect inside it often. Aisin hubs are far superior to these Superwinch hubs but the price reflects that. If Superwinch would build these with a milled cap instead of a (poorly) cast one they'd be great."
2,A waste of money,"I saw Andy Kaufman on TV several times in the 1970s, when he was extremely funny. On this show, however, he seems to be intent upon embarrassing himself. The only good two minutes was his Elvis impersonation; otherwise, this is flat, unfunny, almost an insult to the audience."
5,Solid and durable phone,I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.
5,"Wonderful Chopin selection, briliantly performed","This title comes with two (2) CD's, and its selection is wonderful. It contains many well-known Chopin pieces, it is perfect for those who just started to listen to Chopin as well as his long-time fans. The performance by Ashkenazy is, needless to mention, always so precise, delicate yet so stable ... beautiful! I strongly recommend it!"
3,GOOD,NOT GREAT BUT GOOD. NOT SURE I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN ..........i DO LOVE CHOPIN AND THIS WAS AN OK PRODUCT
2,No Bargain,"This item is overpriced. It is much more economical to cross reference the item with a champion EZ start 5847 available online at Champion's website for $2.64 or at most retailers under $3. This is a super class spark plug, they also have the DJ8J which is a regular class plug for $2.24."
4,Helpful!,"I began reading this book with an open mind, and it changed my life! As I read, I began to understand what God wanted from me before I would ever be able to really love another person enough to give myself to him. This book shows you what God wants for you to understand about loving yourself, and gives scripture and study question to help in your journey. Truly Inspirational!!"
1,I thought I was listening to Weezer,"My friend showed me this CD of this band named Luzer. I go to Towson and I heard they play alot around there. I gotta say, I was really disappointed, he told me they were pretty good (a huge overstatement). I don't know what they're other CD's are like, but this one sound just like a cheap Weezer rip-off. The lyrics are terrible and the music sounds recycled. These guys should definitly invest in finding a somewhat original sound."
3,Finally!!! Not much time spent on restoration,"I've been waiting a long time for this set and I was not really happy with the lack of restoration that they did on the four Joan classics! The contrast and audio are good in HD but they didn't spend much time (if any) cleaning up the dirt and scratches on the prints. Joan deserves so much better! The extras are pretty forgettable and Neal's commentary is too short. Who wants to hear from Christina? Ick! I think we've all heard enough from her already...""yes we know Joan mistreated her""... I'd like to see some of Joan's earlier films included on the next set...and please, spend a little time restoring these!"
3,Not Enough Tracks,"As the previous reviewer pointed out, there's only 10 tracks on the CD.That's definitely a negative; especially considering some of the similar CD sets that are available from companies like Rhino Records. (If you're into this type of music, a much better value is the multiple CD boxed ""Nuggets"" set from Rhino records.)Fortunately, the tracks themselves are good ones. Even Target has been using one of the tracks in some of it's current TV ads. Anyone who's into 60's garage band stuff will certainly enjoy this CD, although it's a bit of a ripoff pricewise for only 10 songs."
3,damaged,I buy these wheels all the time at the petstore however the wheel stand is damaged and the box was opend upon arrivle
4,"LIFEBOAT is an involving, yet slower paced, Hitchcock film","LIFEBOAT is a Hitchcock film I recommend. The events that happen are somewhat thrilling if you get into the film and the characters a sympathetic and human if somewhat cliched. It is a touching film if you are interested in this kind of thing. This is a somewhat different subject for Alfred Hitchcock and he does superior work with such a small acting space. Until the end, all the surroundings are of a lifeboat and in an ocean. The acting is excellent. Tallulah Bankhead is wonderful as the typical unattached journalist."
5,I highly recommend this book for the readers interested in the topic of spiritiual development,The book gives a brief and clear insight to the reader who is interested in the topic of spiritiual development
4,more useful than you'd think!,keeping track of memory sticks is much easier with the holder. also protects the delicate contacts. chose the aluminum one for the cool factor only.
5,Great little case,Sony MSACA8 Memory Stick HolderVery handy for all of the extra memory sticks I purchased. Fits easily into camera case. I'll no longer run out of memory with my camera while on vacation!
5,Get this tape!!!,"This is a wonderful resource for parents, caregivers, teachers and therapists working with children. I gave a much appreciated copy to my child's preschool teacher and have given out other copies to other schools and parents also. It comes with nice handouts for presentations and resource. I am buying my 7th copy to give to another school asking for guidance and information on sensory integration."
3,not the deal I hoped for,"I saw this 3 cd collection of Tull's first 3 releases and issued in 2000 I thought I had found a really good deal. Unfortunately these are not remasters although the sound is not bad. I am not disappointed with the albums and nor should you., the first is bluesy and the following two are more like the Tull we have all grown to love"
3,Sinatra without the warts.,"First, you have to understand it's not a biography. Actually the book's premise is summed up very well by the Sinatra quote on the dust jacket. ""I think my real amibition is to pass on to others what I know. It took me a long, long time to learn what I now know, and I don't want that to die with me."" I think this book does that very well using a series of ancedotes culled from Mr. Sinatra himself as well as others. It covers things such as the Las Vegas ""Rat Pack"" years, his style of dress, his code of conduct, his loyalty to friends. The book succeeds in what it was meant to do, but to get a real feel for the total man I'd suggest reading one of the many fine biographies that are out there. Whether you love or hate Frank Sinatra you'll have to admit he was a very complex man who lived life on his own terms. This book will give you some insights into what drove him to be the way he was."
5,"Love the Bill Zehme book, 'The way you wear your hat'","The Frank Sinatra book , 'The way you wear your hat' , is charming , funny , and a light biography of one of our greatest musical artists. Tempermental , generous , moody , and gifted, Sinatra is a complex subject. I have read the book twice. The man certainly had style and talent."
5,My 6th Ellen Barret DVD,"Ellen Barret creates DVD's for the home exerciser to use when jumping is not an option. I workout 5 days at week at home, teach 4 classes at a fitness chain (2 yoga, 2 step per week) so my fitness level is pretty high.I always to go Ellen Barret when I want a good workout, but don't want to jump and or hop. I like to alternate this DVD with a plyo based workout or step workoutWhat I like about this DVD is my heartrate does raise to a fat-burning level, but does so gradually and with out the high impact. I do add one-pound weights during the workout (one in each hand)and also focus on reaching and extending to help raise my heart rate.This is as good as a low impact workout gets. I just wish the cardio part was a bit longer....but I just rewind and do the cardio part for 50-60 minutes.I enjoyed this one and will add it to my collection."
5,After the Rain...The Soft Sounds of Erik Satie,Excellent rendition of intimate Satie. Very evocative of Paris. Cool and quiet.
3,zymaderm,it worked ok but it took a long time and it is very hard to keep it from running onto skin that is not affected. i purchased it for my six year old and while it was better than having the lazer treatment -- it took about three months for it to be completely effective.
4,i enjoyed the book...but i'm a big fan of the movie,"to balance the reviews i have to add that i really enjoyed the book. i loved the film, the follow up documentry was as impressive (oscar winning i think), and this is a very interesting addition. i must add that one needs to be 'in' with the film making history already (i.e its no introduction to the most infamous 'touch-and-go' film productions) before one could appreciate this. its a well told tale."
1,Fraud Alert!,"Wow what a piece of garbage. The crap I got looked nothing like the picture. It is a cheap, badly put together piece of crap built in someones garage! I guess I can't complain too much for something that cost me $8 and change. You get what you pay for."
2,mom of listener,"I bought this for my 9 yr. old because her class needs to learn the Presidents, in order. Unfortunately, she said she can't understand it."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I guess I shoudl have known that I wouldn't get much for $7, but the piuctur and title of this product suggest that it is a shoe for dealing b;lackjack. No lie, what I got was two, 2-deck card holders. Basically, two pices ofuseless plastic that went right in the garbage. No shoe. No big green box as pictured. Very annoying as it was for a party.Buyer beware!"
1,Music purchase,"What should have been a good value purchase from Amazon was well below average, this is a Handel classic, but is a very poor CD and I would not listen to it again."
5,"Cowboy Bebop rocks! It's a contemporary classic that truly relates and speaks to the 18 to 25 generation, I love this show that","Cowboy Bebop rocks! It's a contemporary classic that truly relates and speaks to the 18 to 25 generation, I love this show that much!"
5,As close to the real thing as you can get,"The book is great it has five very detailed lab exams. Just what a candidate needs to practice for the two day hands on lab. I have taken the exam twice, so I can tell you the authors were right on with the title of the first chapter ""As close as you can get""."
2,Accuracy Counts,"Two of the recent reviews reference 5 exams, yet the book says 6 right on the cover. One touts the addition of ATM Lane as a new feature, yet by all reports Cisco has removed this from the Lab Exam along with other subjects like LAT, X.25 and AppleTalk. I guess youy really have to wonder who writes these reviews and books."
2,incomplete concert!!,"I HAD the original two-LP set; my favorite song was the one chosen as the opener for the LP: ""Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You"". With THAT song missing! this CD is pointless to me. When are they gonna release the WHOLE thing??!"
2,why do people like this game?,"This is the biggest disappointment I've had in purchasing a game in years. This game has such high acclaims, but lives up to none. The graphics are poor, and the game play is dull. The real-time battle scenes reminded me of the Blue and the Gray (a great Civil War game 5 years ago!). The world conquering is slow and makes Civilization seem fast paced. I love the Civilivation games, I love real time strategy games, I love historical things, but I hated this game."
1,Unstable code and non-existant support,Could be an interesting game. Only problem is I can't get through an entire game without crashing my Windows XP system. Tried to get a patch from the Creative Assembly site but the link does not work and several emails to Creative Assembly have gotten no response.
1,Only if want to be a real kamikaze,"Well, besides a sorry cover and title, one thing is true, this is one of the worst books on the subject i've seen, the guy is really a kamikaze, if he tries to use the things he described in the book he will die, it is an insult to the intelligence of the readers and the potential buyers, and if someone tries to rely on the techniques he decried on the book will be in real danger."
2,ATHLETIC ANGELS,"This third entry in the PROPHECY series is the weakest of the lot. I've seen all of them except the second one, but this one is incoherent and muddled and Dave Buggatto's performance as Danyael is really bad. It's hard to tell the good angels from the bad angels, and even Christopher Walken seems bored with it all, as he must have been since he didn't show up for four and five. Obviously trying to lure in THE MATRIX audience, the movie features too many acrobatic battles and chases, and the ending is a real copout. Brad Dourif has a cameo as what else? a looney zealot. Fortunately the next two are more entertaining."
4,Vitamins,"I've used this product prior to ordering through Amazon. The product is excellent, however I believe Amazon's price at $9.99 is too high."
2,Shells were not really large,"These shells wre not really large shells. One shell in particular was a medium at best and I was not able to use it for my crab, it was smaller than the shell he is currently in so it was a waste."
1,Deep technical problems,"The Jewel case set has serious technical problems. I found the game crashes often and requires frequent reinstilation. Tech support says that they recieve many complaints about these problems. I really love these old games, but it is not worth the hastle. Don't bother buying the set."
2,Rambling,"This book was interesting and informative for the first chapters, but began to repeat topics and ramble. Further editing may have been helpful."
1,Not so,"It might come as a shock but Dr. Grandin doesn't have (and, in fact, never had) autism. She might suffer from mild oddities and peculiarities, anxiety, and even repetitive and intrusive obsessive thoughts. That is not enough, though, to qualify her for the diagnosis of Autism. At the core of Autistic disorder is lack of ""theory of mind"", in other words, inability to develop insight into own thinking, comprehend others' thinking, and be able to compare the two. One either wouldn't have the disorder to be able to write a book about inner workings of autistic psyche for non autistics OR have it and never recognize own deficiencies explicitly defined by the diagnosis. It can't be both, and I suspect the former is true. Sorry, Dr. Grandin."
5,Understanding Autism,"As a college professor with a Ph.D., I think in words and have had trouble connecting and communicating with my autistic daughter. This book has allowed me to cross over into my daughters world and better understand how she thinks in pictures. It has helped to redefine our communication and changed my life and our relationship."
3,Nice Christmas CD,"In my haste for looking for some traditional and exuberant Christmas music, and in my blinding affinity for all things ""King's"", I purchased this cd. It is a nice compelation, although I, and I daresay many Americans, am not very familiar at all with most of the hymns/carols on the 2nd cd. Morever, I found most of the music lacking in pomp and circumstance. Of course, now, I understand that is not what this cd set is for. If you want big sound and more familiar tunes, try something else."
5,Best for work,"I buy this watch for work. I like the analog dial, the velcro band is easy to put on and take off. And as a painter the glass face is important to me. I can clean the face with a razor blade and at this cost I don't mind when it needs to be replaced."
3,"a good watch, but..","actually, i bought that as a replacement for my other ""coleman"" watch, which is the exact model as this one.it lasted many years, and held up great through rapid rides and LOTSA bangs, but the buttons had become hard to push, so i thought i'd just get another one..the problem is that i actually use the timer and alarms, and oddly the volume on this new one is so low i can barely hear it when it goes off.funnily enough, just today i almost missed an alarm, but suddenly my cat started looking at my arm, so i realized my watch had gone off.my previous one was much louder, and i can't see anywhere online about adjusting any kind of volume, so i'm guessing either they altered this feature since my last version, or i got a dud this time.kinda sucks cuz i just threw out the box it came in.otherwise i'd send it back for a replacement.still, as a watch, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, so i guess it's not all bad.."
4,A good first outing for Mike Nelson as host.,"A fairly strong episode of MST3K, especially considering it's Mike Nelson's first time as the host on the Satellite of Love. The movie is a lurid and gruesome ""B"" grade picture about a doctor who keeps his girlfriend's head alive well past its freshness date while he seeks a body on which to transplant it. The MST3K crew provide many laughs throughout this lurid melodrama, many of them food references as during their Amazing Colossal Man episode of the show. The absurdity of the movie and these jokes really keeps you laughing throughout. Look for the hilarious host segment at the end where they interview ""Jan in the Pan"" played by writer Mary Jo Pehl."
5,Couldn't Have Laughed harder!,"This was one movie that was so bad, i would have laughed at it without MST making fun of it! Mary Jo Pehl as the ""Brain That Wouldn't Die"" in one of the cut scenes was hilarious! A must see and buy for any MST3K collection."
1,"Makes you itch, turn red in certain spots, and burns!","I have used tens of tanning lotions in the past, but this one is by far the worst that I have ever used! I feel bad to even give it one star! As soon as I put this tanning lotion on my skin, even before getting in the bed, my skin started burning like crazy, as if I was burnt on the stove. When I got in the bed, I became very, very itchy and the entire 20 minute session was an itch fest for me. When I got out of the bed to examine my ""tan"", I noticed a ton of blotchy dark red spots all over my skin. They didn't go away for hours! And I know it wasn't an allergic reaction because when my friend tried it, the same thing happened to her. This is a terrible product! I do not recommend it at all, unless you want to burn and itch all day! Terrible!"
1,WTF???,"I'll be honest. I've never took the time to listen to this music. But man, that must be one of the worst covers since the days of the cavemen!Atrocious!!!!!!!"
2,check the mug,I just bought one of these in a Brookstone store. The stainless steel mug had two rusted scratches on the bottom of the inside. Best to check it before buying if possible.
4,Great for single person,This is a great gift for someone who lives alone. It is compact and finishes are nice. So far it has worked great.
1,What a MESS!,"We've had this coffee maker for over a year and most of the time it does what it says it will do, but our experience overall has been negative. At least once or twice a week it ""overflows"" for no apparent reason. It's NOT that the cup fills up and overflows. Coffee flows from the top, with the mug half empty. This occurs even if we use the mug to measure the water (so it's not that we're so stupid that we add too much water.) We've tried different coffee, different position of the spray arm, etc. and nothing seems to fix the problem. We'll come back into the kitchen after starting the coffee maker and will find half a cup of coffee flooding the countertop. I wouldn't purchase this coffee maker again. We're looking for a replacement."
1,Leaks all over the counter!!!,"Got this as a gift, thought hey..this is great - one fresh cup of coffee at a time and would not be wasting coffee on a bigger machine as I am the only who does drink coffee (husband doesn't). Worked alright for a while and now almost each time I brew a cup..about a 1/4 of the coffee drips onto the counter, down the cabinets, and onto the floor. Even after cleaning it well folks! I cannot tell you how many paper towels I have had to use to clean up..very disappointed..expected a more superior product from Brookstone."
4,great single cup coffee maker,"I'm totally happy with this compact single cup coffee maker. it's quick, makes good, hot coffee. It comes with a permanent filter which was an added plus. I only wish that the cup was a bit bigger. and it would be nice if the cord was retractable or something. Still i'm happy and would purchase again."
2,leaks,I would never get this product again. It worked the first month and then started leaking on a regular basis. I have tried so many different ways to fix it and it is totally unpredictable when it will happen. At least 3 times a week there is coffee running all over. Ridiculous that the $15 one that you can get at wal-mart works better than the one from Brookstone that you shell out big bucks for.
3,I love Jet Li but this movie was disappointing,I was expecting more action and some of the graphics he uses in some of his other movies but at the end of this movie...you're like: What the?! And I think the story line also contributed to the dispointement but I would say rent this one vs buying.
5,Move Over HERO - The Best of Jet Li is FEARLESS!,"Just when I thought good 'ol Jet Li has done his best, he comes out and explodes across the screen with not only a superior action-sequenced movie, but one with heart and soul intact.Jet Li's FEARLESS is much more than a martial arts film, it is a film based on fact, as well as at the very heart of this epic-like feel and tone to FEARLESS is a warm and fuzzy meaning for life. And love.I was surprised at this deep inner soul search for Jet Li's character. I wasn't expecting that. And therin lies the inner workings of a much better than average martial arts movie that I expected. FEARLESS had fantastic sets and imagery that captured the turn-of-the-century timepiece in which is is set in.Donny Yu has most certainly directed himself a martial arts masterpiece here. A must watch or own on DVD for fans of both martial arts movies, as well as just well told and action-oriented tales."
3,Great Action,I didn't enjoy the story BUT as usual the fight scenes were great. I especially enjoyed the scene between Jet and the japanese fighter.
1,Jet Li Fearless (video download),I did not enjoy this movie and as a jet Li fan I was very disapointed
2,As For Me And My House,"This book was well written, and that't the only good thing there is to say. It is the worlds most boring book to read, and if i didn't have to read it for my english lit class.... I recomend you not read this book"
2,Useful only if your baby is not yet mobile,"We bought the skip hop playspot even after reading all the lukewarm/negative reviews because of the pretty color. My daughter started using it at 5 months old when she was just starting to sit up by herself. It was fine then because she wasn't really moving all that much and still hadn't learned to start picking up and grabbing everything in sight. It's now 3 months later and she's beginning to crawl, that's when I noticed that the mat separates very easily, gets easily scratched up, and has many pieces (especially all the little connector pieces) which she grabs and eats. I think the mat's days are numbered and we'll have to go buy a mat that doesn't have all the little pieces and sturdier connections that she won't be able to take apart as easily. Too bad other mat makers don't seem to be catching on to the color feature."
4,"Not perfect, but a great place for a baby to play","I was torn about buying this after seeing negative reviews, but I went for it anyway and I'm not sorry. There are things that could be better about it, sure, but overall it's pretty darn cute and safe place for a little one to play. It's nice and big, too.- I noticed no smell, and I'm really sensitive to things like that- Yes, there are a lot of pieces. If you envision yourself putting this away before the cleaning lady comes each week, unless you have lots of time on your hands, you will quickly give up on that idea. I did!- You can't drag it around without it totally falling apart. I wish I could take this from one room to the next a bit easier, but if you want a mat to use in one location, this one is great."
2,"Nice Idea, but More Work for Mom","This seemed great at first. I was worried about my one-year-old son chewing up the foam, but the foam was really rugged. However, all he does is take the mat apart and we were tripping over all the stray pieces. I spent $80 dollars and it sits in the closet until he is older - I bought a rug instead."
3,Color fades quickly,"I got this mat because mainly because it was the best looking one I could find. Many cheaper mats offer the same padding, but I spent more primarily for the look of this mat. However, we've had it now for only about 6 months and it is already looking terrible. We have it in a room with a lot of windows (but live in a very cloudy area, so it is not in full sun often) and within about 4 months, the yellow faded and is now about the same color as the ivory tiles now. I know I should expect some sun damage, but that much that fast?! Very disappointing. Other than that, it's been fine. Creates a safe space for my baby boy to play. We had no issues with smell that the others mentioned and I like that it's BPA, etc., free. However, like I said, the main reason we shelled out more for this specific mat was for the aesthetic, which is basically down the tubes now."
3,"Cute, but way overpriced for what your getting.","I just bought this item because I loved the colors and its very contemporary. The vibrant foam tiles coated in every color of the rainbow was just not working in my dining room where I keep my daughter's toys. I should have read some of the reviews before I bought this product. The only complaint I have about the color of the tiles is the blue. It almost looks like a grey than a light blue. The circles in the center do pop out very easily so I did have to spend about a half hour taping the mats together on the bottom (which actually worked out nicely). Another small complaint I had was that some of the tiles had dirt spots on them or already had a few scratches. Overall they look great put together, but honestly, this product is way overpriced for what you get and the quality of the mats. I am glad though that SHPS came up with a different look and color options."
3,"Looks pretty, but quality isn't great","We bought this mat for a play space in our house. It looks very cute, but there are a few problems:1) there are too many pieces and they are tempting, even for out 18 month old, to take apart. He's learned at this point not to do it, but a younger baby would have trouble resisting....2) it gets dirty so easily and it isn't that easy to clean.3) main problem: it dents and scratches SO easily! We spent about $150 since we needed 2 sets to fill up our space and this is a lot of money for a product that after 2 months already looks so worn and damaged. I wish we would have bought a cute rug instead."
4,"Pretty good, overall","I purchased the green/brown playspot and was disappointed at first with the colors. I didn't realize there were two different shades of green and two shades of tan. It bothered me at first - I thought they clashed a little bit - but I've gotten used to it, and I'm fine with the overall apperance. Ours did not smell badly, like some of the other reviewers complained of. However, the pieces do come apart very easily. My one-year-old can dismantle it pretty quickly, and actually used it as a teether for the first few days. But as the novelty is wearing off, she's doing that less and less and leaving it intact to play on. It's not too thick but in researching other foam tiles like this one, I didn't find many that were thicker than 1/2 inch. I did find one that was 5/8 inch, but it wasn't as cute as this one. Overall, it does the job and I like the looks of it better than the bright alphabet ones that are more common."
3,"Good product, but what happened to Amazon's PRICING???","I originally purchased one set at the not-so-low price of just over $59.00. After the product had some time to ""air out"" (yes, it has an odor), we were quite satisfied with it. Does what it is supposed to do - give our 10 month old a bit of cushion for the minor spills he is taking while trying to figure out how to pull up, sit down, and take those first steps.I just came back to purchase another set as the one we have is not quite large enough to cover the entire space inside our wooden corral, and wow...Amazon has now decided that if I want these, I'm going to pay $20 more for the exact same thing.Guess I'll figure out how to go without, because although I can afford the extra $20, the thought of paying 30% more for the second set just because Amazon randomly decided to go up on the price is something I cannot stomach."
2,not practical,"I loved the idea of this play mat, and also how visually appealing it is. I was disappointed to take it home and learn that within 24 hours it had turned into a dust magnet. I wipe it down every time I use it, because hair and any kind of dustbunny (I have hardwood floors) seems to want to gravitate towards it. I also agree that it is a pain to clean. Any mess seeps right down to the floor, and you must take it apart to clean it.If you don't mind high maintenance products and have the time to frequently wipe down, then this is a beautiful play mat. I also must say that it is easy to tear out the pieces and chew on them. I don't know how safe the dyes they use in the foam are, but it makes me uncomfortable every time my little one puts it in her mouth."
1,A giant mess,"My 1 year old son took one look at this mat and immediately pulled it completely apart. He certainly has fun doing it (and wearing the large pieces around his neck), but the mat is certainly not being used as a safe floor for him. And what a pain for me to put it back together each time. I have a more secure set on order now and as soon as it comes this is going in the trash."
3,Too many pieces and only a little less garish,"I didn't have a problem at all with lingering odor or off-gassing and I have a very sensitive sense of smell; I'm always smelling things others don't. However I agree with others who say there are too many pieces - my son started pulling the whole thing apart and chewing on the smaller pieces at 5 months old. Taking it apart to clean the floor beneath is a pain there are so many pieces. I also agree with others this play mat is too thin. Which makes it easier to chew and not much of a cushion for falls. Most of all I'm not that impressed with it aesthetically. I still find it a bit garish. It's just better than alphabet tiles in all primary colors. Still I wish I had instead bought solid-color interlocking foam tiles like in a brown that aren't marketed for children. All that said, if you DO like the colors and you're going to put it together and keep it in one place not moving it very often, then you may be happy with it."
2,Hate this mat!,"It looks great but as soon as the kids reach 9 months or more, they start taking it apart and chewing the pieces. Also, the pieces do not fit very snugly together so there is often space between them. The price is way too high. The Step2 playmats are so much better and cheaper!"
3,nice looking product - very fragile though,this playmat looks great (i ordered two of the same for a large area) but the fabrication is fragile (punctures and dents really easily) and there were color bleeds on the two sets that i bought. i was deperate to use them so just accepted it but its odd that both were such poor quality. easy to wash though and my baby loved pulling it apart!
1,Does not work - very disappointing,"This product does not work. I am surprised by good reviews, which influenced my choice I now regret. My experience:- There is a lot more friction in the moving parts compared to the regular roller, especially when the cap is on. This makes it difficult to use - requires much more pressure to avoid sliding.- Applying that much pressure creates uneven surfaces & streaks, plus probably makes the product break fast (see below).- The handle is too short when it's 1/2 or more way in.- The roller's feeding axis became loose before the first room was done, nothing could keep it in, making the product completely unusable.- Just before that the roller became ""oval"" in shape rather than round, resulting in uneven paint layers.- Whole experience was much messier and time consuming than usual, with regular rollers."
2,A disappointment!,"I really tried to enjoy this book, but was unable to. The plot was dull and the story poorly told, interspersed with odd bits about race relations. If you are looking for a fun erotic story, look somewhere else.Sorry!"
4,Good solo tent,"I'm very happy with this tent. I didn't have any problems with it on a trip to the adirondacks, in the snow or algonquin park in Canada. Nice tent, light, easy set up."
3,Poles broke during backyard set up,"Read reviews about poles, but said to self - I will be careful. Set it up in the backyard and left up for two days to test weather. Back pole broke right at the metal ferale in the middle. Eureke! Customer service rep is nice and I have faxed Amazon reciept and she will send replacement poles for free. However, I am checking other web sites for other poles that might hold up. I have an old old Coleman tent and its poles are still good. What gives Eureke! designers? You see all the complaints - you should redesign and use different brand of fiberglass or put a curve in the poles design that can handle the design of the tent. Having said all this - no leaks with a bad rain....once I get other poles - I will update my review."
5,great little tent,"I have an old Eureka Gossamer, which is the same as the Solitaire but has aluminum poles.This is an awesome backpacking, bicycling, and motorcycling tent. Excellent ventilation, and I love that you can roll back the fly during warm dry nights for stargazing and a more 'open-air' experience. I never used any seam-sealer, but have never had any wetness, and it's been through some storms. I think it was set up for 9 stakes, which is a lot for such a small tent, but you can piggy-back the 2 at the head-end corners (fly and tent) to reduce the count by 2.You have to sort of slide yourself into the tent....kind of back into it. Changing clothes in there is not easy by any means, but is do-able. Some gear can fit inside the head-end of the tent (unless you're Shaq), and I usually tuck my shoes under the edge of the fly at the head end.I love flicking mosquitoes that are buzzing just over my head.....they smell me, but can't get to me...."
5,A fun read,"In this book, Abby's friend Jessica, who recently moved to Oregon, comes back for a visit. And, boy, has Jessica changed. She now wears miniskirts and tank tops, chats with her boyfriend on her cell phone, has curly, auburn hair (it used to be straight and brown), and now goes by the name Jessy. Although Jessy is different from the Jessica that Abby was best friends with, Abby learns that, although she is often frustrated with Jessy, Jessy is still a loyal, fun friend. I think that Jessy's changes were pretty realistic. Moving away can definitely change people. This was a fun book to read, and I recommend it to anyone who likes the Abby Hayes series."
5,Some things do change,"Wow! In this book a lot of things do change for Abby. First there is a talent show, where Abby does not want to preticipate, but pairs her two best friends, Casey and Hannah together. Then Abby's former bff, Jessica-now Jessy- comes to Abby's town to visit from her father, stepmother,and stepsister's house. Abby relizes thet Jessy has really changed. Jessy carries a cellphone, has a boyfriend and wears miniskirtrs 24/7. In this novel Abby relizes for the first time that some things do change. I would reccomend this book. It was an enjoyable read."
2,smells,"the pan is really non-stick, but it smells when it's getting hot. and the cake, or whatever you do, absorbs this smell too. i wouldn't recommend this product to anybody."
1,Not accurate: Check the check weight,"I ordered two of these 50-gram check weights.When they came, I checked them on two different accurate scales. Neither weight was exactly 50.0 grams. They each would either round up or down to 50 grams, but that is pretty useless for calibrating. It was not worth the shipping cost to return them, so I threw them away. If you decide to buy these, get two. You can check them against each other if you do not have access to accurate scales."
3,Go for it,You need this to test your scale. This is 50g all day long. It nice to have to check in between usages.
4,works fine,"when i put it on my scale it showed 50g, works just fine though nothing special or extraordinary about it"
5,A++,"great weight, right on. was very happy with this product and now can calibrate and check my kitchen weight when baking."
2,Do Not Order If You Are Getting the 1000 Or 600 mg Scales,"Amazon recommends this product as a calibration weight if you are ordering the 600 mg or the 1000 mg electronic scales. I ordered the two recommended weights, hoping to cut through some of the nonsense, and was dismayed to find that neither of them was useful. The two scales that I mentioned, both of them, require a 500 mg calibration weight. There is no way to change the calibration weight required, so if you ordered this weight you are out of luck, unless you want to pay postage to get three dollars back."
5,50 grams indeed,Bought this to calibrate theCuisaid ProDigital AccuWeigh Digital Kitchen Scale With Cuisaid Calorie Guide 11 Lb. Capacity (Grey Tempered Glass)and I have no complaints with it. It is well-made and comes in a little box in which I store the weight in.
5,This is the one to buy!,"A number of years ago, I went to the Classical Record Store in Toronto to acquire a copy of Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos. Like many others, I'd been introduced to Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto by the movie ""Shine"". When I asked the resident musicologist for Rach 3, she rolled her eyes. I explained that I wasn't remotely interested in the commercial David Helfgott version. I wanted the definitive version. She smiled knowingly and took me to a shelf. This is the version she handed me. Buy it. You won't be disappointed! Ashkenazy is at the peak of his powers and Previn does a phenomenal job with the London Symphony. It doesn't get any better than this."
5,Countdown Mix Masters: American Pie,Track Listing:1. Countdown Mix Masters: American Pie [4:30]2. Project Q: American Pie [5:36]3. Countdown Mix Masters: Ray Of Light [5:18]4. Countdown Mix Masters: Beautiful Stranger [4:25]
4,Punk is the best,"This CD is extra. For punk fan, you must have this CD. I bought this CD because I love punk but when I hear all the song of it, I fall in love with this CD. For people who like group like NOFX, Blink 182, Green Day and all the other great group, you must have this CD. You'll not be disapointed."
2,Decent for the price,"The reason I bought this VCR was the price and because I own a Phillips Magnavox TV. On the plus side, I can control the TV with the VCR remote. This VCR plays tapes, the response is slow and there is no easy way to adjust the tracking using the remote. Shop around unless you already own a TV by the same manufacturer."
5,Wonderful Children's Book,"If you want your children to get into history this is a good start.The author is familiar with all the aspects of the fall of the Alamo and puts the story from the view of the dogs (named Liberty, Justice and Furall) that were owned by the main characters of the hitorical incident.The characters are easy and fun to follow for every adult that may read this wonderful and heartwarming story to their children. There is no political overtone, only a pivital hitorical event told from a different aspect.This book has been chosen by the Daughter's of the Texas Revolution to be sold AT the Alamo book shop!"
2,Gigaset,"The main reason I bought this phone was for my Mother who has some dexterity problems with her fingers. I was looking for the Voice Dial function which has become very popular with cell phones so she would be able to dial without using her fingers.This function requires that you use the 5-way toggle pad to get to the feature. If you push too hard on the small, sensitive toggle pad, it is becomes another function. What in the world were they thinking?Why would even want Voice Dial if you can have programmed speed dials??? BAD DESIGN!!!!The other issues were all present that others have complained of.The features of this phone are excellent but function is terrible for this much money."
3,Complicated and Caller ID Inept,"Just got this phone, and I am returning it as soon as possible. There are some really cool features, and the phone is well made, but it seems like the deisgners have NEVER used caller ID. You have to press at least three buttons to get to the call log (my old Sony jumped immediately to it with the scroll wheel) and for some reason, the call log does not display the NAME of the caller, only the number. The phone does get the name of the caller when they call, but it doesn't list it in the log, which is really annoying.The phone is also very complicated and counter intuitive. I sat down with the manual for about an hour and still don't feel like I have a good handle of all the features and settings. I have NEVER had to use a manual to set up a phone before. Perhaps the ease of use of my iPod has spoiled me..."
2,It's all true,"All the complaints about this phone are true. It's about the most sophisticated phone I've ever seen, but, in the end, it just falls short. I agree with all the other complaints I've reads, and I want to add this one:The batteries [are bad]. THey're cheap rechargeable batteries. And while some might think this makes it easy to buy replacements, I'd more concerned with the fact that they don't hold their charge very well and die every 2-3 weeks."
2,I wish I could return,"I have the 4215 and spare handset with base(I think its the 4210). I bought this combo because of the positive reviews when I was researching on this site, speaker phone feature, and sleek look. I now wish I could return it to Amazon. The phone is not intuitive to use. I am pretty technical and normally can figure things out without readding the manual. Not so with the Siemens phone. Also, there is no key for instant mute. The worst part is the keys are slow to execute. Meaning if I press a key, there is a delay. My cable remote is the same and I hate it! Other phones do not seem to have this problem. The battery also seems to be weak. If I leave the phone off the base for a day, the phone is dead. I would not recommend this phone."
1,Great on features but Battery life stinks,"This phone offers one of the best features on the market. You could select the ring tones, give a name to each extension, have it ring only 1 of the headsets depending on the choice the caller makes, conference call, Volume and distance are decent, size of phone is like a cellular phone, keeps alot of redials. I had returned this product 3 times with static problems and battery life. On the 4th there was no static but standby life on a fully charged battery was only 2 hours with talk time being 15 minutes. Customer support was no help. This phone would have been a 5 stars if the battery life lasted a decent time."
2,Don't Buy At All,I bought this game in May because it is fun for X-Box. When we got it it started freezing on me and the controls really stink. Since we didn't like the freezing we tried to return it...If you want this game buy it for X-Box of PS2...
4,as good as the movie,"had it not been for the camera views,the game would have been the best I've ever played.it is really based on the movie with only one fault.you must look around for web-cartridges where as in the movie the web is organic.despite that,the game makes you recall the film with the best-detailed videos,dialogues and voices used.finally,i am really looking forward to its sequel..."
3,Don't Buy off Amazon,I bought this game in May and I was pretty exited when I recieved it. The only problem was that it froze up on me every few seconds. My dad and I tried to return it but the policy on Amazon[.com] is no returning video games. My advice to you is to buy this game if you are ubsessed with SpiderMan somewhere over the rainbow.
1,Uninteresting....,"I find it appalling that a man can gain ownership of a woman and her home at a king's command - but that being said, it was the way of things and based on that I will say that Talia should have been damned grateful to Alex for rescuing her from Rufus. Alex was hero material all the way and yet she was petulant at every turn. Didn't make for a happy story, but a dull one."
4,Love the Show,"This is one show I truely enjoyed, even my brother liked it. However, you REALLY need to put it on DVD. Think about it as alot of us who don't like or own VHS tapes would buy it in a snap on DVD."
2,Mellow,"I would compare this to Portishead but, without the salt and pepper. What I mean is that 27 has a nice beat and a woman singer but, not the spice that Portishead's rhythm section has. It still is a nice album to put on and have a drink to."
2,CHEAP FOR A GOOD REASON.,IF YOU HAVE ALL DAY TO SCAN AND RE-SCAN THE SAME BARCODE OVER AND OVER TILL THE CAT READS IT THEN IT MIGHT BE QUICKER JUST TO TYPE IN A NUMBER.SMALL AND CUTE BUT NOT VERY GOOD.
1,Buyer beware,"The item Surpluscomputers is shipping is *not* a modified CueCat. It does not function as a standard barcode reader and still functions as a regular CueCat, encrypting all data. Be aware of this before purchasing.*** Note: it is surprisingly easy to modify the CueCat at home. After performing the modification procedure the CueCat now works as a standard barcode scanner. A web search for USB CueCat modification yields many helpful websites."
3,Was a good idea...,"I got one of these units free when RadioShack was handing them out free years ago. It scanned a barcode and told info about the product but being it was new and such, nobody entered the info about all products out there. Now you can scan barcodes with your smartphone and get a far better result quickly and wirelessly."
2,Watered down in more ways than one,"This film is a thinly disguised and poorly orchestrated takeoff of ""The River Wild"" without the same kind of cast. Since I love river stories, the rapids and excitement of wild backcountry adventures, I gave it a try.Four friends buy a rafting trip on the Zambezi river and end up being brutalized by their guide, who has flipped out. A ""Rebel without a Cause"" it would seem. HIs adversaries appear as if by magic off and on along the river and one might think it was a figment of his twisted imagination, were it not for one of them showing up at the end of the film bidding the survivors adieu with his arm in a sling.But the camera shots of the wild river and foaming whitewater were beautiful. If that was all it was about and it's enough for you, then it was worth watching. If you're looking for substance, this probably isn't it. Opinion only."
1,Misleading,"First off, the order details say medium shells. When I received mine I got a package of SMALL and medium shells and all 3 of the shells were small. I have a medium sized hermit crab, her claw couldn't even fit into the small shells. If I ordered medium and that's what the seller is telling me I'm getting, than that's what I should be getting. Not something different."
1,useless,expensive and useless to my hermit. shells are not worth what i paid in price and postage for them. hermit crab took one look and refused them because of size and shape. i wish i didn't buy this junk for him.
5,"for collectors of 12"" versions on CD...at last you get some complete","As far as I know, this is the FIRST time the full 7 and a half minute version of ""Love on Your Side"" has been on CD--every compilation I've ever found the supposed extended version on has used the EDIT from their Greatest Remixes CD--and Lies, while not as hard to find complete, is also often just the edited version from the same CD, but here, it is the full 6 minutes and 37 seconds. And We Are Detectives is 5 minutes and 49 seconds. So the bonnus tracks alone make this CD worth the purchase."
5,TELLS IT LIKE IT IS,"A great book, hard to put it down, inportant to publish this type of history while the men who were there are still around."
5,Suited a Guadalcanal vet,My Guadalcanal vet has read copious books on the subject. He says this is the best researched and produce he has read-and it's long.
1,"Wow, is this book poorly written.","This book reads like the authors' notes for giving presentations - which I'm sure it is. There is a ton of repetition, and it obviously wasn't edited at all. Plus, the grammar and punctuation are what you might get if you asked a third grader to write with the dense verboseness and gobbledygook of a military tech-writer. This is the first book on the subject that I have read, and there was some good, basic information, as well as some unintentional laughs. But surely there are better books out there, at a better price. The hard information in this could have easily been condensed down to a pamphlet."
4,luo benga,"The music cuptures the mood of a lost benga generation,and reminds us of un feeterred love,as we grew among our People's, embrace love, and You'll. Never live single.my community support marriage."
5,Fantastic,"We have two Chonda Pierce videos. She's funny, entertaining and uplifting. We love her and just watching her blesses your heart. I saw her in person in Phoenix and she's fantastic!"
4,Lose the clicking noise and a star is born.,"At first the loud clicking noise bothered the hell out of me. It was so loud I thought it would damage the hearing of our little one since the toy would be very close to his ears. But still he had fun with it, making impractical shapes with the pieces. Kids, you gotta love them. Then on a whim, I took a Phillips screwdriver to the big piece with the motor in it and opened it up. There I found the culprit, a tab that, when the motor was running, would make the clicking noise. So I undid the screw that attached the tab to the housing, removed the tab, reassembled everything, and voila, the noise was gone! Now we all enjoy the toy even more!"
2,Under 4's might like it,This product is not very much fun for anyone over 4. This product does not hold my 6yo child's attention for longer then 5 minutes. She got bored with this real quick. I even got new software hoping to grab her interest and she still does not play with it.
3,"Good, until the end.","The series was good and funny, until it decided to stray from it's lighthearted atmosphere (which is common in a lot of these types of animes). When the last 2 or 3 episodes show up, it becomes nearly unbearable for my viewingSPOILERSA few important characters seem to die, or be on the verge of death, and their death speeches are way too frikkin long. One death speech seemed to be enough (at about 3-5 minutes), but then that's all the rest of the episodes are! First it's one of the good guys (or one that used to be good), then another one, and then the person who is supposed to be bad but is on the verge of turning. These scenes get to be way too much for me. It turns into one of those animes where I wish the annoying characters would just die. The worst part is that they don't. They all live at the end, bad guy (er, gal) included!So 4 stars for the first 3/4 of the anime, 1 star for the last 1/4, 3 stars overall. At least the series started out funny, even though cliched."
2,Poorly Finished...,"I was attracted to their angular design but was disappointed by their poor finish. The brand name and size is stamped onto each spoon and the stamping shows clear to the other side in a very uneven and unintended way. The polishing, too, is inferior with dark and light patches. Other measuring spoons, also made in China, are so well made and finished that I can give this item only 2 stars for its (possibly) elegant design.I recommend the Oxo measuring spoon set for the lovely combination of rubber and stainless-steel or the Endurance Spice Spoons made by RSVP if you are attracted to the rectilinear look."
1,Amateur Hour,Don't waste your money. My middle school daughter has created better movies. And this is NOT film - it's video. Misnamed on both counts.
3,RV Tote,Easy to use. Flex hose is durable but longer than necessary. The level indicator needs to have a vent added or a vent should be added to help in a good flush.
1,Skip these!,"I thought they would look great with my new curtain rod. Don't waste your time or money on these. They fall off the rod and often fall completely to the shower floor. They're heavy so they could break something...like an acrylic shower floor or a tile. I'm afraid to let anyone use them. I'll put them in a bag for my next garage sale. They're shiny, someone will want them, and then they too will put them in their own yard sale someday."
2,Looks good but falls off the rod,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing these hooks. Even with a heavy 13 gauge weighted liner and a cloth shower curtain, 2-3 hooks come off the rod every time I get out of the shower. It has happened 4 out of 5 time so far. Yes, it gets annoying but at this point it's too late to return them. I gave it 2 stars because they do ""look"" nice."
2,I am returning these due to morning frustration!!!,"OK, if you are a morning person you may not mind having to every day sloooooowly open and slooooowly close your cutain with these things so they won't fall off. I bought mine at Lowe's for a buck more so it is a good deal on the price. BUT, i am glad i saved the box cause i can't handle the effort so early in the morning. ANd even with much care to avoid it, some will still come off the rod. Then I have to hang two or three back on it again. I gave two stars because they are really pretty and dress up my curtain and bathroom. I love the way they look on the rod, but for me, convenience and peace is more important than decorative style. I am actually on here looking for the cheap old fashioned ones that won't fall off every morning."
1,"Should be renamed ""killer shower hooks""","These hooks are poorly made (fall apart), but the worst aspect of these hooks is their weight. One fell off the rod, hit my bathtub and took a huge chunk of porcelain off the edge. The tub was brand new; it now looks awful."
2,"Look Great, But Do NOT stay on rod","These hooks look great, but I too have had trouble with about 4 or so falling off the rod everytime I open and close the curtain. It gets annoying. I would recommend something else that is more functional!"
3,Typical Simak...,"Clifford Simak tends to write books with fascinating premises which aren't fully developed, leaving the reader to wish for more resolution to the story. Yet, they're such interesting ideas the books are worth reading anyway. I also find that I tend to like his characters, but upon a close re-read I realize he has barely bothered to flesh out the characters, but somehow he manages to make them come across with personality anyway. I think it shows real skill in minimalism in his writing.This book is no exception to these generalities. Inscrutable black boxes arrive on earth and begin to eat... yet give amazing gifts to humans in return. However, the trustworthiness of these gifts is in question.If you don't mind a novel that seems to just drift off instead of coming to a conclusion, Simak's books, including this one, are worth it."
2,life's too short,"gizmo worked fine around 18 months, then stopped working altogether. Given it has no moving parts, is only a set of connectors, I don't even see how that's possible."
2,Rust included,"Install was easy, because this is the 2nd Polder Duo rod I've purchased (also have the brushed).I've had this for about 8 month's. There are rust spots coming through the chrome already. Granted the bathroom doesnt have the greatest moisture removal system out there, but 8 month's is a little soon for this to be happening. I gave it 2 stars, just in case your bathroom has no hot water, and the dual rod system is really great."
5,Excellent renditions of lively 'old music'.,"'Sinners & Saints' by Philip Pickett and the New London Consort is just a bit too ambitious with their subtitle, 'The Ultimate Medieval and Renaissance Music Collection' as I find it hard to believe that 70 minutes can be the ultimate anything on 500 years of history. This is especially true since they seem to focus a lot more on the sinners than the saints, as there is virtually no liturgical music here. But, since there are so many good recordings of medieval liturgies, we aren't missing much.This is really the sort of thing you would expect to hear from a travelling troupe of minstrals, but not from a solo artist, as practically every performance involves several instruments and voices.Some tracks will sound especially familiar, as they are very similar to Carl Orff's 'Carmina Burana', inspired by medieval texts.Compared to many recordings of music from Shakespeare's time, this collection is superior and well worth the investment."
4,Ye groove to yonder beat,"This album is probably one of the livelier and most celebratory early music entry I've heard in a while. The pulsating, repeating music captures the folk origins of the classical music heritage, complete with an occasional shout of Ay, Santa Maria! to keep the the flavor spicy. A worldly complement to the more ethereal and spiritual early music offerings of vocal groups like Anonymous 4."
4,Impact Socket Set,"I haven't used yet, but the sockets appear to be of decent quality. I was dissapointed that the tools are made in Taiwan as this wasn't mentioned in the description. I would normally only buy made in the good ole USA."
4,This is a really good CD!,"Well, the 1 thing that made me put 4 stars instead of 5, was, Placido Domingo seems TOO overpowering... I'm not the person that likes tenors all that much (I'm okay with Andrea Bocelli, though! hehehehe)Sarah Brightman does a great job in Requiem & Kyrie, and I love her little 45 second duet with Placido. That's wonderful! I'd just buy the CD for that.. Recordae, she does fabulous, as in Hosanna, Offertorium, and Pie Jesu, and it all!Paul Miles-Kingston does great in Pie Jesu, and especially Rex Tremendae! This whole CD is great though! I'm glad that they didn't have a song just for Placido, though, as they did for Sarah and Paul.But, buy this CD if you have the chance!"
1,Mediocre beyond words,"Like most of ALW's so called ""music"", this Requiem is complete musical pap. I am completely bewildered by the popularity of this hack. He hasn't written anything decent since his score to ""The Odessa File"", a surprisingly promising effort, but following his ""career"" has been a downhill ride ever since. I'll never forget the time I first played through much of his Phantom of the Opera. I started laughing so hysterically at its crappiness and total lack of inspiration, I rolled off the bench to the floor to the amusement of several singers. The new Phantom score by Claude Michel Schonberg is no masterpiece, but it's loads better then Webber's feeble attempt. I rank this Requiem as the worst ever attempted. If I was the composer, I'd be ashamed to put my name to it. I would have done with it what Sibelius supposedly did to his eighth symphony...toss it in a roaring fire, page by page"
1,"The CD isn't that bad, but the music...","I can't stand this Requiem. It pales in comparison to Mozart or Verdi's Requiem. If you truly want a relaxing, gorgeous requiem (that truly sounds like a funeral mass), turn yourself to Faure's. It's so peaceful that he took out the Dies Irae and replaced it with his own ""In Paradisum"" movement. If you want an exciting, *dramatic*, more opera-like requiem turn to Verdi. In between would be Mozart. That's my opinion. Andrew Llyod Weber's Requiem, however, is terrible. First of all, he really should stick to broadway. He can't do funeral music. The voices are unbalanced, the piece is unbalanced, with repetition to the point of nausea. If you're going to spend money on a purchase of a requiem, turn to Faure, Verdi, or Mozart (Berlioz's is okay, and Brahms' is in German). Save yourself the pain."
2,Boring Video,"I was rather disappointed with this video. It is pretty boring overall. We don't get to know the members of the band very well, we just hear them make pretty lame jokes while in studio, which aren't very funny. No effort is made to show their once crazy lifestyles. It is no pantera home video I'll tell you that. The one cool part is seeing them playing songs in studio and hearing early versions of the songs which appear on Youthanasia, one of their more mediocre albums. Don't get me wrong, I'm a diehard megadeth fan, but this vid simply does not live up to expectations."
2,Fps freack,"After reading all the reviews,some bad and some good i finaly bought this game hopping it were good.Well after playng the first levels i found out that it is no that good.Attention all gamers and pc-freacks:If some of you probaby played (HALO)and expect to be almost the same,wrong and yes the controls are almost the same but does this say something? Graphic=2 Sound=2 Game exp.=3, and if you want a real Fps. game buy halo or wait for Halo 2.This game its worthy to buy only if you are a beginner in this kind of games and you get it for $10 bucks."
4,good overall,"The first thing I have to say about this game is: This is not a first person shooter. It is a third person shooter like GTA. This game can get boring a little fast, but it has some cool features: Two different types of multiplayer; one you can go against a friend and you would each have a squadron and the other is just a head-to-head match. Each character has a special ability. Tex can take out two weapons, Flint has a auto aim, Brutus has this weird heat-sensing thing and Hawk has a stealth mode. Each person can only take two guns. There is also a co-op mode aswell."
1,"All The Hype, None The Fun","Well, yes, It is a Halo wannabe. Yes, it was intensely hyped. And, yes, it DOES, suck. I was expecting this to be an amazing action game with incredible opportunities to use your teammates in really cool strategical ways. But no, it is just a game where you run and gun the whole time, and get bored a lot. This game does hae some high points though. It's take on multiplayer is really well though out. Too bad the ame is no fun. A waste of money if you already have Halo, Ghost Recon, etc."
1,Why can't I rate it NO STARS?,"Big mistake. Although it was in ""brand new"" packaging, the disc itself was warped and wouldn't play. After visiting several electronics stores they suggested a boiling water dipping method, which actually straightened the disc, but it still didn't play. Don't waste your money on this one. I found it at a used video game store a few weeks later for a better price. . . . AND IT WORKED!"
3,Fun but not as good as Halo,"The initial reviews set my expectations really high to a point where I was expecting a ""Halo quality"" game. It is no where close to Halo in terms of video/audio. But it is still a fun game to play especially since there are very few quality co-op games out there.,"
2,This Ain't No Halo,"This game is way over-rated. the graphics are fair. Trying to play two-player split screen is impossible. The weapons seem like they were taken from an old nintendo or atari game. This game has nothing on Halo. As a matter of fact, this is horrible and not worth the 49.99."
4,This Uncanny will cause Unrest,A group of school girls discover the truth to an urban legend whenone by one begin to die under strange circumstances after witnessing a black hooded figure. The result is a horrifying and scary experience. It's short running only 77 minutes long but doesn't let up for a minute.In fact the scenes are so quick you'd think that they had a 77 minute deadline or face the firing squad.The music and mood setting are wierd and unsettling and the faces of the creatures made me shudder.One note of recomedation: The film has the option of subtitles or not make sure you hit the ON button because for the first minute I couldn't figure out what they were saying.One thing I particularly found interesting when the ghost appears only one friend sees it and the other doesn't HMMM. I haven't seen a good scary ghost story since The Changling with George C Scott. It's refreshing as cool clean good ole Vermont air. ENJOY!!!!!!
4,True Horror,"This may be similar to other Japanese ghost/horror films, but I wouldn't know that(I haven't seen the Japanese versions of Ringu or The Grudge yet). I thought it was truly fear inducing at times, and it captured a vibe that Hollywood horror movies haven't come close to since the likes of The Shining. Anyway, this movie is dark and creepy, and I highly recommend it."
4,Good book for people interested in SF,The title is very truthful it is a brief history and does not really go in depth but its a very nice overview of the history of Air Force's Security Forces.
3,2-1/2 stars... It's not well produced,"Noisy for the sake of noisy, as far as I can tell. The distorted, scratchy guitars arc about wildly and spasmodically fill all the available space; Ruth sings, but the lyrics are incomprehensible; the band sort of bashes away behind him. There is a tunefulness to this album, but also a deep sense of self-indulgence; parallels to My Bloody Valentine and Radiohead fall short when you realize how poorly structured and uninvolving these songs are by comparison. Had I a higher threshold for wanky rock provocation, I might like this better... But I think I'm too old to care anymore. Signed, Grandpa."
3,Hardly the masterpiece described,"This Nate guy has a lot going for him. He knows his way around a drum machine and can noodle on a guitar and knows a few notes on a keyboard, but to compare this to Radohead? Loveless? Pet Sounds? Please! This guy like a lot of folks got bored and recorded a couple of his songs on a cd. If there is bass guitar, I can't hear it....something else I cant hear...HIS VOCALS! The reason I gave this guy 3 stars is because this could have been an epic masterpiece with the right guy producing, Dave Friedman maybe. I also appreciate anyone who can put out an album that has him/her playing all the instruments. Nate, please, next album, get a producer, let me hear your voice, and I will support you. Until then you are on your own."
5,One of the best!,"I bought this book for my mom year's ago when I was a kid...some 20 years ago. The blueberry, pumpkin and cornbread muffins are a family favorite. I have my own copy now, and always have an extra or two to give out as gifts."
1,Deceiving advertising,"Dissappointed by product received. Advertising is deceptive. Image is for standard 2-ball can. (Can of 1) description is ambiguous with 1 can. Pricing is in line with can of two. Ad states - ""Product Features The standard of the industry. Exclusively USHA endorsed. 2 per can.""Recieved one ball per can for $11 each. Filed a couple of complaints with no response and my first 'review' was removed.Pretty unsatisfied with this transaction. Won't deal with this supplier again."
3,Drawing Scenery,As a new starter to sketching I decided to purchase this book.Although it was very interesting it did not help me as much as i thought it would.
3,beware,"This is a fine camera. Compact, user friendly, takes ideal pictures. However, all the nice points are completely spoiled by the fact that it uses a PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BATTERY which is near impossible to find (only on the internet by the way) and expensive to boot. To make matters worse, it is essential to have at least one spare battery. I've had the camera 18 months to date, and my original battery is all but toast."
2,"beware...1st version of holiday in spain on this cd is sung by Blof, not counting crows","Beware!!! i assumed the 1st song on this cd would be CC's studio version of holiday in spain, but rather it's performed by Blof and it's not sung in english. also, the live version of holiday on spain is a duet by durwitz and blof's singer. the 2 in between live versions are cc alone and are probably worth the price if you enjoy those songs as much as i do."
1,Ethics Be Damned,"It's unbelievable that people reviewing this book do not, apparently, know the story behind it. (Go to any search engine to find out.) Mr. Swanson, as CEO of Raytheon, published thousands of copies at company expense and gave them out free to virtually anyone who wanted one. He gave numerous speeches on ethics in connection with the book. However, several months after its publication, it was found that Swanson plagiarized virtually the entire book, word for word, from a 1944 classic by W. J. King called ""Laws of Engineering."" The Raytheon board took away his bonus for the year and cut his compensation significantly. That he was not fired is the more surprising. I'm shocked that Amazon, or anyone, would sell copies."
5,The next step for civil war literature.,"This book goes beyond what you get in the big books aka MacPherson, Catton and Foote. It explores the battle at the individuals level and explores the effects of the battle on those involved as well as the country as a whole. What seemed like such a bad choice from afar begins to make a grim sort of sense as you see Burnside's original orders and his overall plan for the battle. His plan called for a Chancellorsville style flanking attack that was so massively ignored that it made the attack on Marye's Heights the debacle that it was. If this sounds intriguing then get the book, it is well written and engrossing. On the other hand, if you had to look up names to understand what I was talking about then go get MacPherson his is wonderful."
4,American made you can't go wrong!,Bought numerous wrenches & gave them out as gifts. I received nothing but praise for each given. Made in america!
1,I don't see a use for it.,Most nuts are out of reach or not out in the open. The only way you can use this on any thing is if the nut has free space all around it. So I grab an adjustable wrench and leave this one collecting dust.
3,Good tool,"Bought this after reading an article about it on NY Times, mostly out of curiosity. Like all the reviews point out, this can only be used if there is enough clearance all around the nut. Kind of cumbersome to use to tighten or untighten the nut because of having to regrip constantly. However, it comes in handy when having to hold a nut from turning while you work on the bolt from the other side. I used to use crescent wrenches for these needs, but having this makes it easier because I don't have to go looking for the exact size crescent wrench and this works with all the common nut sizes.Is it a must have? No. But does it come in handy if you have it? Yes."
3,"Fun tool, limited usefulness","The fact of the matter is that with a lot of things these days, manufacturers care a lot more about cost of initial build than repairability. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a tool like this just isn't capable of accessing a slightly recessed bolt or nut. Just did a timing belt job on my car and I'm sure there wasn't a single hex fastener head in the whole job that I could've used this wrench on. I bought it because of NY Times article on Sears violating the bionic wrench's inventor/manufacturers patent. The bigger size might work for my wooden deck, but it's not nearly as useful as a Crescent style adjustable wrench even if it's quicker. Plus you have to squeeze while you turn, not much good in limited spaces."
5,MADE IN USA and works!,We saw a story on TV about this product and company regarding Sears. We were so impressed I was on the computer ordering before the story had finished. We ordered 8 of them for all the men in the family for gifts. GREAT tool!
1,"put the ""B"" in zombie","I really don't mind a b flick but this was just silly. I'm even ok with with a little bad acting as long as you make up for it with some good carnage and gore. But no, this one's a real let down."
5,100% must read.,If your really into history Colonial days you should really put your hands on this one. It takes you on a drive full of feeling to that era. Im Italian and it made me recall my grandparents village in Palermo... I give Gullermo A. Baralt an A+
1,MELISSA'S DRIED PAPAYA,THIS PRODUCT CANNOT COMPARE TO WOODSTOCK FARMS DRIED PAPAYA SPEARS. THE TASTE IS TERRIBLE AND WAY TOO MUCH DYE IS USED (NOT HEALTHY). I DID LIKE THE PACKAGING BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - SPEND A LITTLE MORE AND GET THE GOOD STUFF.
5,V.P. Franklin looks deep.,Franklin looks deep into the life of the late Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. His insightful looks on the full compass of his life makes for an extraordinary piece of work. Never before mentions of different aspects of King's life makes this biography a must read for all who have loved and adored King.
1,Does not meet expectations...,"This was a rather disappointing presentation. It starts off ok with views of Hong Kong and nice background music. But from that point, it becomes highly repetitive with scenes of airliner landings. These scenes also do not illustrate the full extent of how challenging it was to land at Kai Tak with the tall buildings and the right turn banking, etc. This video seemed to reuse footage of the same landings over and over. I'd give 3 stars for the intro, but 1 star overall. Definitely not worth the money! The Discovery Channel has a significantly better 45min DVD called: Extreme Engineering - Building HK's Airport. I highly recommend Extreme Engineering over this DVD..."
1,how boring,"I have only ever flown into the new H.K. airport so I thought it would be great to live through the landing at Kai Tak, which I had heard so much about (weaving through buildings so close that you see what people were watching on T.V.) Nah, this DVD is about what you see at any airport when you look out to the runway. Planes touching down and coming to a stop! Over and over and over. Come to think of it, this could be a perfect DVD for insomniacs."
2,Nylon Locking Tongs,It serves the purpose that it was designed for but a little flimsy for my taste.
4,Best Tongs for your pan,"These are the ONLY tongs I've found that have protective jaws that grip. Most others are weak or slippery. The locking mechanism can take a bit of getting used to, but it is hands free."
3,"Really wanted to like the Seth books, yet found them tedious...","I really wanted to like the Seth books, and bought most of them. Unfortunately, I found them to be tedious, monotonous and entirely un-stimulating reading. I have no problems with no age concepts or versions or reality, or techniques such as channeling. The issue for me was that I couldn't dive into the uninteresting prose, for long, and no matter how I looked did not find any interesting content. So, having bought several of them, I gave them away. That said, I know a great many readers find the work to be both fascinating and life-changing. So, as literature is much like art, and appreciation so subjective, definitely take a look at the books for yourself. Hopefully you'll be one of the majority who loves these books. In contrast, I really lovedThe Seat of the Soul. Happy reading~*"
2,Dry and Cloudy,"I'm surprised to see so many people gave this book a 5 star rating. Firstly, the idea brought by the author is not new. Secondly, there are a lot of repetitions of the same arguments, but very few good examples are given. And finally, it is too boring and confusing to be read as a source of enlightenment."
2,Good radio with flaw,"Agree with other reviewers about audio quality and good looks of this radio, but I get a very loud pop whenever I change station, change band, turn power on or off, etc. Quite an annoyance from an otherwise good little radio."
4,"Works great, watch hardware","Love the product, noticed immediate throttle response improvement. They were short on nylock nuts, kind of a pain, everything else went great. The Torx 20 Allen supplied is very helpful in replacing rear speakers as well"
2,bad tennis game,I can't believe how bad this game is. Hard Hitter has AWFUL announcers who repeat the same lines over and over. That's a really big distraction right there. The controls are pretty unresponsive too. Sometimes you have to hit all the buttons to keep up with the ball. I don't know what the game company was thinking. I don't even know who the tennis players are. There's really no reason to own this game when plenty of better tennis games are on the market.
3,Great Tale for Women,"I did my best with this book but I couldn't finish it. I was underwhelmed by the writing, which seemed geared toward young adults and readers of romance fiction. The numerous description of the author's vanished consort and the cliched snippets of erotica that went with them were too much for me. I felt at times that I was reading one of those books that people leave behind on airplane seats. This doesn't detract from my admiration of Ms. Ashcraft and her journey. I just wish she'd chosen a different collaborator."
5,"Impactful, Insightful, Inspiring","After I watched this, I got out a piece of paper to write my ""Must Do"" list: Get involved, write a letter, make a phone call, volunteer at a shelter, speak out, make a difference. This piece is so motivating and made ""activism"" real and ""doable."""
1,scary,"This documentary is very informative. I learned that not only are animals being mistreated, but that there are plenty of nut jobs that get involved in speaking out against this issue. I am an animal lover and felt that PETA was a proper organization to give to. After this video I have learned that PETA really is a terrorist organization and should not be applauded for the domestic terrorism they commit. My eyes are open so much wider now thanks to this documentary. There is a way to tackle all issues we face in this world. Using dangerous unlawful means is not the way to go about being proactive and productive as should be obvious from watching this video."
2,mixed feelings,"its a very well made documentary and very educational.i would like to say that i support PETA but i cant. i fully believe in everything that they are doing for the animals (minus the hypocritical killings) but dont like how they try to make their points. in Ingrid's eyes, ""there is no bad publicity"" yet there really is.there are many people that are completely turned off by PETA's outrageous tactics and think anyone that tries to support animal rights is nuts. in fact, simply doing a peaceful protest against puppy mills draws a lot of these people to poke fun, say we're crazy and assume that we are a part of PETA, which we are not.PETA has done some good but has also damaged the name of animal activists and advocates for eternity. we are stuck fighting even harder for the animals because of what they have done."
2,READ BEFORE BUY!,"The product was not up to my expectation at all. It requires either 3 AAA batteries or an AC charger, but neither was included in the package. Also the roll up piano only has 37 keys, but that was my fault for not reading the product details. this product was meant for children. Another thing, the piano wont flatten as one section of the piano was bend out of shape. Not worth the $45 (with S&H)."
2,item not working,I was not happy with this item it would not work and it is a christmas present/and I had to order another one.
1,One key didn't work,"One of the keys didn't work. I ordered another piano, an actual Roll-Up brand piano. It worked and was better quality in general."
1,Piano without major note,"I purchased the roll up piano for my Granddaughter who has recently started to take piano lessons. I thought it would be useful since there is not a piano at her home. She is devastated. One of the key's that is used most often (D) does not work. I was a little leary when I purchased the keyboard since some of the comments said keys were defective. This is my first purchase on Amazon.com. I'm going to see now, how good they are when I return the keyboard for a refund."
4,Cool Tools Box,"I searched for this toy on the internet after my 18 month old son wouldn't let go of it at his cousin's house (we had to ship it back after a plane ride!). This toy has just enough different options to keep him busy for quite some time (great for road trips). It makes noises, identifies the shapes when they are hammered/ pressed into the shape sorter and does more than 1 song (phew). My son absolutely loves this toy."
3,"Daughter loves toy, drill doesn't work","My 2.5 yr old daughter loves the toy and plays with it for long periods of time. It seems to be made well also. I would agree with some others who have said that it is frustrating and misleading not to have molded in places to put the tools. However, since the lid is deep, they still fit inside the kit. My main gripe is that the drill doesn't work. I put batteries in and nothing. That was one of the reasons I bought this toy so I am quite disappointed in having a broken drill but I will contact the company and hopefully they will provide a replacement."
3,Toy tools,"Good for small child developing fine motor skills, tools are of lesser durable quality than I expected. They way they fit into the toolbox is not the best, but Ok for a two year old interested in tools. Overpriced for the product."
3,Popular toy but did not last,"It was an instant hit with my 4 and 1.5 year old. The younger kid enjoyed the shape sorter. Both kids played with the screws. The drill could be better - it did not turn and only make sounds. However, the electronics stopped working after three months. So turning the gears and using the shape sorter did not make any more noise. E-mailed i-play and never got a response."
4,This toy was a hit with my grandson,"My grandson loved this toy the minute we opened it for him. He is 17 months old and was able to turn the screws with the screw driver. The shape sorter feature announces the name of the shape when the child inserts it the proper hole. The gears make music when they are turned, and the drill mimics drilling sounds when it is operated. However, the drill bit does not fit into any of the screw tops. Unless there is a safety issue, the drill should have been made to fit some if not all of the screws. Still my grandson loved the drill piece best especially because it made sounds while he operated it. This toy runs on batteries. I could not put all the pieces in the case so he could carry it around."
3,Tool Kit,"It was fun but really not that interested for my 3 year old, maybe when he was younger he would have enjoyed it more, my 8 months old baby plays with it more..."
3,Good for babies...,"The toy is nice and my daughter (3.5) has have a lot of fun but she gets to frustrated some times because she wants to do more than the toy tools allows her to do, ex. the screws don't come out, and is really hard to fit everything in the box."
3,"only over bridge, not under","This bridge is both colorful and durable (it's very easy to open the drawbridge and close it securely, even for my 2 1/2-year-old) but the blue slab of wood at the base of the bridge makes it impossible to set up tracks so that trains can go under it. It seems to me it wouldn't have been that hard to simply engrave track grooves on the blue base so it could link up to the rest of my son's tracks."
5,Rothenberg and Zinn,"A colleague of mine introduced me to this book in 1991 while we were teaching courses in women's issues and human diversity. I have since used this book -- every single edition -- as a required text in human diversity at three major universities. Currently I am teaching in a graduate social work program in a rural setting at a small state university and will be using this text again for the third consecutive year. The students have consistently rated this book highly because of the interesting articles that Ms. Rothenberg has included. They actually enjoy reading the book. The articles are informative, provocative and timeless and give the students an excellent historical context and lens through which they can analyze and understand some of the most burning and divisive contemporary issues. I am reminded of Howard Zinn. I hope Ms. Rothenberg continues to publish this rich material. She tells the true story!"
5,one of the best,One of the best narratives about WWII I've ever read. Very exciting and well researched books about one of he most important battles against Japan.My only complaint is the price. It's too high for a book this old. Why should a digital book cost this much? You can find hard copies for less
2,Not even worth renting.,"I'll admit it. I was excited to play Summoner 2 at first, it being recommended to me by my cousin. After the first time I failed the first mission, I decided that I didn't want to admit that the camera angles sucked and that I was just bad at the game. Several attempts later, i was incredibly frustrated that I had died so many times due to simply the jerky camera. This aside, the anime like graphics and unrealistic attacks, I almost felt forced. And I thought comboes made you vulnerable for a moment! The final guy on the first level with the flaming sword attacks me with a double combo and pauses so as i go into attack he unleases the third part of the combo. The game is jerky and inconsistent. Summoner fans, I beg you not to play this game, or you will be spending the next few weeks in a dark corner of your room, wondering where your game had gone."
3,Better than I expected,"I gave the first Summoner two thumbs down: lets face it, it sucked. I thought I might as well give this a try, since I could buy it for only 2 bucks. I began to play, and was amazed at the difference. Much more colorful, better looking characters, with lots of diversity and many ways to attack, instead of just constantly hacking at something in front of you as if it was fire lumber! Spells weren't much different. Music stunk, basically made of bongos. :( :( But the voices fit the characters, and the story line was interesting. The only thing that really bugged me was the fact you could only summon four summons, whereas in the other Summoner, there was multiple summons, such as the Blue Imp. But you might just want to pick it up for the weekend and try it out. The game wasn't terrible...but it was lacking a lot also."
4,5-star deduction,"This is a three star book that tells the tale of a five star piece of deduction. While Hodel is ultimately proved right by revelations that came from police files that were revealed after the books was published, I spent much of the reading of the original books disbelieving the case he was putting forward. Worth the read, though."
1,A Response From the Family of Elizabeth Short,"The family of Elizabeth Short has authorized me to say that the photos in Steve Hodel's ""Black Dahlia Avenger"" are ""definitely not Betty."""
4,Is this crime solved?,"This book is a must-read for any true-crime aficionado. However, I had a problem with the photos that sparked Steve Hodel's search for truth. Mind you, I'm not a trained eye, but I see no resemblance whatsoever to Elizabeth Short in the photos. They look like they were taken of completely different women. When I looked at the crime-scene photos, I did see more of a resemblance to one of them, but I didn't do any painstaking study...too disturbing for my taste. In any case, Steve makes a convincing case for his conclusions. Growing up in LA, I can recall many of the references he makes and the names he mentions. I would like to see his conclusions tested in the mainstream, with some journalistic support."
3,Dahlia Avenger,"I was turned off, I believe, by the 2nd page, where the author refers to himself as a real-life hero, and name dropping (John Huston--even Lash Larue, for crying out loud). Also, anytime a suspect with a single trait--such as swarthy, 6'1"" tall, intelligent, terrific dancer--then that suspect was definitely dear ol' Daddy. The 2 mystery photos said to be of Elizabeth Short could be anyone BUT Elizabeth. Still, it's fun to read these untrue-crime stories."
5,"Oh, You Poor Man","I have read this book several times now, and always have the same response- you poor man. When I originally read this book, I only knew of the Black Dahlia as an unsolved, grisly murder. The investigation Mr. Hodel pursues seems very complete, and the story of his home life with this monster is heartbreaking. When he reaches the inevitable conclusion, my heart breaks for him. How do you deal with the knowledge that your father is a serial killer? Still, the evidence is compelling, the writing clear and the story moves right along. It is Excellent."
4,Black Dahlia Avenger,"Just finished this book, lots of good evidence and I have to agree with the author as to who killed those women. Sometimes the book was a little too detailed in reference, but understand it is all necessary to give the full picture. Now I will read the Black Dahlia Avenger II."
3,Not convinced.,"Mixed feelings on this book; I don't believe the author shows any ""without a doubt"" evidence that his father was anything but a genius/wierdo/creep. I also do not see any resemblence in the two photos he swears are Elizabeth Short from his dad's collection. I got the impression during most of the book that he is guilty of trying to force the evidence to fit his theory so he can claim to solve the crime no one else could solve. Speaking of, I got the impression at the beginning that the author is a little ""full of himself"".One more small thing--I couldn't stand the way he skipped around from chapter to chapter, instead of covering one subject matter and moving on. Five chapters later, he's on the same subject, again!! (mostly pertaining to witnesses & evidence)None the less, I'm glad I read it, but wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it full price."
4,I Liked It,"I must be honest, I would have never read this book if it wasn't for my book club. I had never heard of the Black Dahlia to read about it was instersting about what had happen back then. I thought it must of been so hard to write this book to know what your own father had did all those things, though some may not believe that the author's dad is the real killer,or think this is a daddy dearest it's not. Since this was for our book club read, we had a very specail surprise treat, The author of this book Steve Hodel was there and to listen to him and to hear his stories made me understand the Black Dhalia more since then he has found out more things out it was just amazing I am so glad that I read ths book.Happy ReadingLisa"
4,"""Maybe My Family Isn't So Dysfunctional After All!""","Look, whether or not Dr. George Hodel was a serial murderer among whose victims was Elizabeth Short, AKA ""The Black Dahlia"" -- and Steve Hodel makes a pretty good case that he might have been -- read this book to get the dirt on a family that makes ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" look like an episode of ""The Donna Reed Show""! I loved the author's sister Tamar -- the truth speaking Cassandra typecast as Lolita but who ages gracefully into the Original Flower Child. I pitied the author's alcohol and sex addicted mother, and could not get over the deception pulled by the author's first wife. My take: as far as ""solving"" the Black Dahlia murder? Ehhh. Maybe. But as a domestic drama? This book is da bomb."
1,Free ticket out of jury duty,"I wasted my time reading this ridiculous book, but I have to admit that nevertheless it does have some redeeming value: If you ever get called for jury duty, bring this book with you, hand it to the judge, look him or her straight in the eye and say proudly, ""I'd convict on the evidence I read here."" I guarantee you'll be headed home in no time."
2,Fanciful Evidence,"I am almost finished reading the book; however, the closer I get to the end of the book, the longer its taking me to finish. In the beginning, I found the evidence very convincing and interesting, but the more I read, the more fanciful the evidence becomes. The author made big leaps in his deduction of the crime, which made the book and his research less credible. Although the pictures of the woman in his father's photo album are beautiful, I don't think its Elizabeth Short."
4,Great!,"The story is great. Especially due to so many facts the author adds to back up every one of his comments. I also recommended ""Childhood Shadows, Nine-O Adam, Slaughter House Five""."
1,Avoid this Crusade,"After The Pope announced the crusade against the Saracens, in holy city of Jerusalem, thousands of Europeans who had nothing to loose in their country, went for this war. The story of this movie revolves around these facts yet.........If you are looking for true stories about the Crusaders, good acting or good filming; my only advice is; stay away from this movie.Try Kingdom of Heaven instead; the director's cut. There you have it all."
1,"this pump sucks, and not the way it should","i got this pump as a gift for my baby shower. it was not the one i wanted but the one i got. i tried to pump after i was engorged. it sucked like 15 mls after 15 minutes. there was more milk on my clothes and breast than there was in the bottle. i set the pump to suck at the highest setting and still nothing. it is really loud, too. my dogs went nuts at the sound of the motor. you would think that with such a loud motor, there was a lot of pumping going on according, but alas...no such luck.do not buy this pump!!!! if you do, it is at your own expense.i talked to a lactation consultant in my area and she told me what i had already figured out. this pump sucks, and not in a good way."
5,Exactly as depicted.,Nice wide nylon blade and lightweight stainless handle. Easy to use but handle does get hot if left touching the pan. I'll be looking for more from this company.
4,"If you do not already own a Fondant book,then this is it.","I was looking forward to getting this book.I was disappointed that it has alot of the same cakes and ideas that several of my other books already have.If you don't have any books on fondant or only have a couple, then i would suggest getting this book.It has lots of picture's & does a good job on explaining what to do."
1,"Good songs, atrocious quality","This was a terrible disappointment. DO NOT BUY IT. The tracks are clearly copied from original recordings, but a result of this is that they are almost impossible to understand. Lyrics are inaudible in places. I bought this to play for the history classes I teach but I think that this will be a bad idea.I would rather have modern performers recording the songs, as is done with music from before the phonograph. I want to hear this music, not scratchy noises."
3,Ankh Ring,I down rated this ring due to the sharp ends of the Ankhs. I don't wear it much because it catched on clothes & other items.
5,Recommended for college-level students of other cultures,"LINKED HISTORIES: POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD is a pick recommended for college-level students of other cultures: it brings together a range of disciplines and articles covering postcolonial studies, one of the fastest growing fields of critical inquiry. Essays cover many of the major issues of linked history research and investigate challenges of new theories of globalization as they relate to postcolonial studies. A complex, revealing survey results.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,IMHO not Adorney's best,"I truly love John Adorney's music, as you will see from my other reviews, and his first three albums are among my most treasured CDs. However, for some reason, this one, albeit full of innovation and variety, did not thrill me or fill me with the rapture that his previous works did. I have listened with great enjoyment to the first three albums countless times, but I could only make it through this one a few times. Obviously, from the other reviews of this album, this is only a very personal (and probably erroneous) take on my part. I'm sure that Adorney's next album will thoroughly seduce me back into his magical spell."
3,It's ok however,"Personally, I like it except, it would be nice if the handle had a grip. My big hands find it a little small. Now, my wife, doesn't like it at all. She would like to see the handle being a little shorter. She thinks it awkward being so long. Guess I will have to saw the handle shorter and put a rubber handle around it."
3,"Kids will eat them, but they can be messy","My toddler refused to chew the ""gummy-type"" vitamins so we looked to these as she likes harder foods. She will eat these, however, if she takes them out of her mouth or drools they produce a very dark dye that is a pain to clean up. I wish the color was less intense as it makes me wonder what is included that isn't needed."
1,Mediocre Euro-horror for Naschy fans only,"A descendant of a medieval warlock (Paul Naschy) tries to locate his ancestor's grave, with predictably disastrous results. Slow moving and formulaic, this movie may be of special interest to Naschy fans, but most others will find it difficult to sit through.One and a half stars out of five."
5,The Tao of Henry,"Magnificent, sweeping, hilarious. Henry's soliloquies are peircing and pithy, peeling back the layers of social convention with a self-deprecating shrug that sharpens his observations and causes both the full belly laugh and the uncomfortable feeling that he might actually have a point: the true test of a humorist. Obscure literary references, a penetrating gaze on the vagaries of everyday life, and a vicious sense of irony that spares no one combine to produce commentary both amusing and pointed. No matter how badly your day has been, peering at the world through Henry's steamed hornrims will make you realize that nothing is really that bad after all. Henry Panky is truly the humorist, indeed the chronicler, our times deserve."
5,Great soundtrack,"My husband and his brother both love this soundtrack, and I like it too. We've been playing it for months and it still plays perfectly."
4,Sammo masterpiece!,"A Good Film with great fight choreography along with some good comedy, and a great cast. Such stars as Phillip Ko, and many other familiar stars from other films. Some original styles, and some fast action make this a must have. Sammo out did himself in this one."
2,Not so great,"I picked these up after I saw them reviewed on Kool Tools. They worked okay for a while- they obviously have a lower run time then normal batteries because there's less actual battery there, but I figured that was offset by the convenience of being able to charge them off of my laptop computer. However, after only about a month's daily use in myGarmin GPSMap 60CSx, the USB connectors on several of the batteries started to separate and stay stuck in my computer's USB ports when the rest of the battery was removed. I had to pry them out with needle-nose pliers. Given the risk of damaging a computer for a simple battery, I can't recommend this product."
4,I hate traveling with stuff,"I'm traveling back and forth all the time.This might be a bit expensive compared to other batteries, but for the convenience of not having to carry your charger is priceless.I use them for my Bluetooth mouse for my laptop, and they work great.The charge lasts for months (like regular batteries).Besides, they make a great gift for a geek friend.Buy the again: YesREcommed: YesPros: no need for chargerCons: Price and less capacity than other batteries."
3,they tried,I give it 3 stars for effort. All in all the recharging cycle is hard to tell if it has reached completion. This is because many computers will effectively 'shut off' the USB port if they do not get a response from it. Almost every time I attempt to recharge the battery light comes on for a few minutes then shuts off.The batteries upon test are not fully charged. The computerS that I have tried this on just do not like a no-response on the USB port.
2,Doesn't hold a charge.,"I bought 2 packages (4 batteries) for my Xbox 360. I followed the instructions for charging, waiting until the light on the battery went out, but it didn't hold a charge for more then 10 minutes. I kept my 360 on to try to charge it again, waiting for the light to go out as instructed, and it wouldn't even start the controller after charging it for more then 6 hours. I opened the second pack in the hopes that the first was a fluke and charged the new batteries in my 360 and it still didn't work. I then tried my PC and laptop and still nothing.I give this a 2 because the idea is still sound, too bad it doesn't work."
4,Very cool device,"Love the device, so cool, so useful. I only wish it came with a docking station as the USB slots on my computer only seem to want to fit one at a time."
2,"Ok, not very magnetic",The basketball magnet curls up at the ends. It does not stick very well to my car. I just removed it before I lost it
3,Gorgeous girls and funny in the wrong places.,"If you've seen this kind of film before, you're going to get exactly the same thing. Lots of very nice, busty girls (Julie Smith - wow!) take their clothes off for no reason, other than it makes guys happy. There are some pretty buff guys for the girls and some bad acting for everyone. And I mean VERY bad.Overall, this isn't a bad film - no shocks, no surprises and you can see the twists coming a mile away. Odd little bits in the film made me laugh; people getting the use of the words anagram and acronym mixed up and foliage being pronounced ""foilage"". Thank goodness there were no libraries, nuclear reactions and nothing happened in February.If you want something Pacino, De Niro or James Woods would appear in, steer well clear of this. If you want a Friday night film to have a few beers with - you could do a lot worse. Once again: Julie Smith - WOW!"
5,US Coast Guard Flag,There is no better day than Memorial Day to write this review. I served in the US Coast Guard and wanted this flag to be hung on the wall in my boat room which is my guest bedroom. I was so pleased when I received this flag and loved the size of this flag. It is perfect hung over the bed as it is the same width as a queen size bed.
2,A weak ending to a series that deserved better,"First of all, the last sentence of the book alone drops this book's rating from 3 stars to 2. A downer of an ending is one thing, even a positive for this genre--but a self-important downer of an ending is simply annoying.That said, the trilogy as a whole is pretty decent, just don't expect any literary masterpieces, particularly in this volume. The plot device stolen directly from Hamlet is pure cliche, and the author seems to forget how to write an even semi-convincing female character. The ending seems to show promise, getting the reader to start thinking about issues of the allure of wealth and international trade (very salient 30 years later), but the last sentence destroys any good will built up by that point. It's fine for the narrator to be down on life, but moping? It's out of character, and jarring enough to remind the reader of the (many) other flaws in the book."
4,The sword of the spirits,the book is in quite good condition. It also arrived on time. I do recommend this seller.
5,United Nations,A great album of music played by musicians from around the world. I particularly liked the William Tell Overture. A great collection!
4,Good for Weight Watchers...and any one else too,"I really enjoy this smoothie. It tastes good and is filling (only 1 point if you are on the Weight Watchers plan). It is great for on-the-go in the morning and since it has a lot of fiber it keeps you full for a longer time. A friend mentioned that it has a lot of carbs, but complex carbs are the ones that keep you full, so I think it is a plus. There are Dannon Light and Fit smoothies in the stores that are somewhat comparable and don't cost as much, but they don't have a Cafe Latte flavor. I like to mix mine with iced coffee. I do recommend this product."
4,Definitely convenient,"The taste of this product is OK, but I find that it is good enough for a convenience snack. I have a bit of a drive home after the gym and I like to have these on hand to sip right after to get some protein and calories back in. I prefer the Cafe Latte and the Chocolate Fudge compared to the other flavors."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This won't work in pre-2003 Sony devices, as Sony made a design mistake on original memory stick (and kept its consumers in dark). Neither would existing card readers work.These sticks contain MagicGate protection. This means that you won't get even 954 MegaBytes of actual space from this 1000 MillionBytes stick. MagicGate uses up significant space (100MB) and create all kinds of hassles in transfers of things like mp3's.But wait that's not all, these sticks are kinda obsolete already. These won't work in any SonyEricsson cell phones or smaller Sony devices like Stick Walkman & newer U series Cybershot cameras.If you want to invest in sticks buy a MS Duo Pro, the latest of half a dozen stick formats from Sony. (Soon most cell phones will have a slot for removable flash media) Or you can say no to all Sony devices and buy SD/MMC based gadgets to avoid all these hassles."
4,This is a good adventure with a curious Cyberpunk feel.,"To my recollection, this is one of the first films to play in the Cyberpunk genre. With shades of Neuromancer mixed with Road Warrior the film does what good films are meant to do, they entertain and open your eyes just a little wider. It's a road picture that takes place in the future after an ecological disaster. Humans live underground, but the underground thrives topside. Our hero, a female bodyguard, is assisted by a lovesick Bio-droid to sell off some electronic drugs in a last attempt to escape the hellish world she lives in. Unfortunatly, Plughead has other plans for the Drugs and he relentlessly chases the duo cross country. Some whacky characters help flesh out a very amusing story, including Leech, excellently played by Dennis Christopher (Breaking Away). The film is a good ride through an imaginative future."
4,So horrible you spend the entire movie laughing,"Any movie with mutant leaches in it is classic. Why does the gigalo bot need to breath? The girl seems to carry more than two knives, wouldn't that be uncomfortable? Curious, then buy this movie and have a good time laughing your but off! Come on, the villan is named plughead. Classic"
5,Mr. Holland's Guide to Classical Music,"This is an excellent collection of essential classical pieces. Every track is of the highest quality performance. The CD insert provides a short, applicable summary of each selection and each composer. It is the very best collection of classical music I have found- for beginning classical music lovers or seasoned vetrans of the arts- of ALL ages."
1,Does absolutely nothing,This doesnt seem to clean at all. I think you have to pay the money and get your jewelry professionally done
5,Great Knife,"I own a number of high quality kitchen knives and I have to say this one ranks among my favorites. It is my second choice only to my shun, which cost considerably more. Although, I must admit the difference in minimal. I would certainly buy this product again except I doubt this quality instrument will need to be replaced in my lifetime."
4,"book recieved, very good condition","Book received very quickly, in excellent condition, library bound. Has a slightly funny chemical smell. Otherwise would be 5 stars."
3,An interesting example of the earliest psychedelic rock,"As I say in my title, this cd is an interesting example of the earliest 60s psychedelic rock, interesting mainly for those who have a completist compulsion (probably this is my case) about a rock music genre. Of the pieces contained in this cd, the most outstanding is Missing Out, a very complex piece of music, filled of improvisation and jamming. However, in spite of being very good music, the sound of High Tide is dated. For me it is difficult to find currently any wave of neo-psychodelic rock that can be regarded as rooted in High Tide's achievement. Let us consider ""Sea Shanties"" as a very fine album that is representative of the musical idyosincrasy of the early psychodelic rock music of the 60s, without evident relevance in current psychedelic rock music."
4,"Sound Samples available under ""Sea Shanties/High Tide"" [IMPORT]","Just to let you know that if you want to listen to extracts of this album, as for the present there is none here, you may be interested to know that :Another album of high tide, a compilation of two of their albums, not for sale anymore, gives you access to samples of all songs : you will find it under :Sea Shanties/High Tide [IMPORT](on amazon).I give 4 stars, but I don't know this band, except for the samples. looks interesting, but a bit disordered. Looks like there is some violin too, maybe."
2,false advertising,"My mother bought this book for my daughter because it has a huge picture of the tortoise and the hare on the cover, but the story is not actually in the book. She asked me several times how my daughter liked the tortoise and the hare until I told her it wasn't included in the book. She had to see for herself since it is so obviously depicted on the cover. She ended up buying another book that actually did have the tortoise and the hare."
3,There are 2 sections in this CD,"There are two different sections in this CD. Section 1 includes marches 1 to 12 and it is not the best recording that I have ever hear for Sousa Marches. However, Section 2 includes marches 13 to 23 and I consider that this is one of the best recording I have ever heard for the marches of the USA Services. So, even if the two sections are very different, you may buy this CD if you have never listened the Sousa marches; it will give you the opportunity to hear them. After that, if you wish to buy a high quality CD of Sousa Marches, continue to shop on Amazon."
1,Lame,This is lame. I exchanged it. Butterbean is a world champ that you have to beat. There is no career mode or training simulation. L A M E.
2,Another Disappointing Series,"I just finished the High Druid of Shannara series today and was left sorely disappointed. The Voyage trilogy and now the High Druid trilogy continue to reflect how Terry Brooks has lost his ability to tell a rich story. Too many items were left unclosed, supposedly tough villains were actually extremely wimpy at the end as well as extraordinarily dim, and at the finish you're left extremely disappointment. The Ard Rhys's ultimate solution to her own personal problems was to run away from them even after all of the sacrifices that were made for her by others (sorry, the self-sacrifice feeling just didn't get through).I have truly enjoyed Terry Brooks earlier Shannara books but these latest novels have just not lived up to the standards he has set with his earlier works within this genre.Borrow these books if you can or just don't bother. You aren't missing much."
5,"The "" Other Side""","Reading from Elfstones of Shannara always made me wonder the Other Side. Truly incredible.If I was to try, I cannot outmatch what has been written."
2,"Terry, what happened?","I remember starting my Shannara journey in sixth grade with Wishsong, it was hard at my young age. But I forged ahead and read the previous two books and never looked back. I've been a loyal Brooks reader but I'm so glad this trilogy is over because quite honestly his writing has steadily declined. One reviewer wrote his recent trilogies could be compacted to one book and I agree with another two books.I could always count on Brooks books to be EPIC sagas. Superb classics. Writing about the personal introspection and feelings of his characters and then zooming way out to write those glorious battles.And now with this recent book. Not only short and 2-dimensional but: ""They smiled at each other across the table, sharing feelings that couldn't be put into words because words would only get in the way."" What the hell was that?..."
3,I wish his books were Devoid of all Enigmas,"As a young child I read TB's Shannara series. There were suitable for kids and young adults. Much like Tolkeen's works. The plots were very intriguing, broad, and flushed out.He has added features to his book he was able to forgo before and they have not improved things at all. The later books are filled with regularly sexually violated women. Something never seen before. What has changed in him that he found he had to add this element to his books?Further, these new books are shorter, not nearly written as well, and not nearly as concise as the older ones.Finally, he needs to find some new words. Devoid and Enigma are used up, worn out, and have become distracting, at least to me. To the point of irritation. Really, how many people can be an enigma?Getting bored... Perhaps I am just devoid of enjoyment and thus an enigma compared to the other readers."
3,"Okay, but not thrilled","I have loved every Shannara book Terry Brooks has written; except this trilogy. While it had all the necessary components of a good story, I felt it lacked depth. It seemed like it was a story that had been edited severly in order to make it into three books. I think the story could have been expanded into a four-book series in order to tell the story in better detail. Those of you who read the third book will understand what I mean. I do have one question: What happened to Atalan? Was he killed or not? This is just one instance of many that bothered me. Good job, Terry, on your other books. Boo on this one."
2,Challening to use,"While good in theory, these are not so good in practice. The ""non-slip mat"" is cheap and does not hold the letters in place. I have tried multiple non-slip surfaces, and my son (4 1/2) still has to hold down the letter with one hand while tracing with the other - awkward. I wish the letters were more weighted or had a more rubber (gripping) than plastic (slippery) backing."
5,All you need,This knife will replace half the gadgets and appliances in your kitchen if you learn how to use it properly...It will also last a lifetime. The balance is excellent and these molded handles are much more comfortable than the old riveted ones.
2,not really.,"i bought this book thinking it would be some kind of masterpiece. i found the name of the book from the bibiolography of ""the witch must die"" by sheldon cashdan. the description sounded SUPER SUPER interesting, and when i bought it i could hardly wait to start reading. that's when the trouble started. it was a VERY good story, it just never took off. the good ideas were there, but the writing style just left a sour taste in my mouth. i can't really put my finger on what it was, but it just wasn't *right*."
5,An Epic Journey,"This book takes you back to a ""what if"" imaginative look at another side of THE WIZARD OF OZ &/or the Broadway Musical, WICKED. I was a little skeptical about this book. However, I had to read it as friends (Antonio Convit & Tim McGraw) gifted the book to me on my birthday: 5/26/2003). Then I was swept away during a flight from Los Angeles to Miami to Barbados as I completed the book. I really thought the author gave sound advice in terms of living life in a happier way. ""Perhaps when you are a bit older, you will also learn to be wiser"" is in fact a line in the book. I loved the surprise connections and heartfelt sad moments...I can't tell anymore because it could ruin a new readers journey. I highly recommend this one."
3,"Great As a Novel, Not So Great for a Genre","I opened this book with a great anticipation of an amazing story, and closed it feeling slightly depressed, slightly mislead, and slightly jaded. I've come to love ""spin off"" novels about fairy tales and folk lore, and I have to admit this isn't the best I've read of the genre. I DO support its value as a great NOVEL, but if you're looking for a book that gives you an alternate view of Oz, this wouldn't be the one I'd recommend. It has a very disturbing and very personal view of incest in it, so a reader should be prepared to take on a great many controversial issues in a very intense voice. Anyways, its a good book if you're just looking for something interesting to read and occupy your time."
5,nice,great collection of movies from a legend in his time. My daughter is taking Karate and loves the movies.Thanks
3,"Where's the ""Chinese Connection""?","How can this be the ""Ultimate"" colection when it does not include the ""Chinese Connection""? Far from ultimate. ""Enter the Dragon"" is also missing, but understandably, as it is from a different studio from the rest.Why bother including ""Game of Death 2""?The older boxset is better. It includes ""Chinese Connection""."
3,Long Live Bruce Lee!,"This dvd collection is alright! I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5 stars! Well, 3 stars go to the 1st 3 dvds: 'The Big Boss', 'Fist of Fury' and 'Way of the Dragon'. The half-star goes to 'Game of Death'. It got only a half star because the movie was never finished when Bruce Lee was alive. It was only years later, like 6 years or so, that they decided to finish the movie! The only great parts are the Bruce Lee fighting scenes, of course, and the Bruce Lee outtakes/extras. Other than that, I could've done without the 'Game of Death 2' dvd. It should've been replaced with 'Enter the Dragon'! Something that Bruce Lee actually did finish, right!?!??! It was bad enough that 'Game of Death' was a bad movie to finish and a part 2 had to be made! Let the man rest! Get this collection if you are a die-hard fan!"
2,So disappointing,"Good:- The picture quality is better.- Watching the three movies (The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, Way of the Dragon) in Chinese with English subtitles is much more entertaining.Bad:- Game of Death II shouldn't be included. This is NOT Bruce Lee movie.- The sound quality is tooooo over enhanced. The ""Kiaiii ohcha ohcha"" voice of Bruce Lee is NOT real anymore. My brother watched ""The Big Boss"" with me and he asked me ""Why the sound come before the voice?"".Don't waste money on the Ultimate Collection. The Master Collection is still better. Buy The Bruce Lee Master Collection & Enter The Dragon (Two Disk version), you will have a complete set of good Bruce Lee movie."
2,I tried to justify the previous reviewers review but....,"I figured since my children were all under the age of 10 this book would be awesome for us...BUT beware. This is not a felting book, this uses premade felt (although a expensive german wool felt resource is listed in the back...but again expensive!) I was expecting felting ...from wool not SEWING dolls with felt peices. Although they are very cute in their own respect. I also think this book OVERUSES wood doll forms! NEarly every doll calls for this...i havent the faintest idea what the heck it is or where to get it...they apear to be wood beads but this is not what they are called. Again as long as your net expecting what i was then this small book is very cute."
4,I really loved this collection,"I stumbled upon this collection and am very glad that I did! The linking theme here is children who or orphaned or without their ""own people"" to claim as kin. A few of the stories are sentimental, but most of them are lively, charming and beautifully written--just as one would expect from the author of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. And there are a few surprising treasures here as well. L M Montgomery in these stories reminds me a little bit of Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary Wilkins Freeman-- she captures the little joys and sorrows of ordinary people, often hard-working, poor people, and she gives the characters flavor, humor, pathos and dignity. If you've loved the other Montgomery books, chances are good you'll love this one, too!"
2,Scent,"This is the first time I have ordered a essential oil on line without being able to test the scent. I found the scent not the same formula as I have purchased in the past. It is a thinner, and I have to use more of the product."
4,very pretty,"I havent used these pans yet, but they seems really nice and match all the red accents in my kitchen"
1,Not a good pan,"This was another silicon pan that I tried hoping for bread that held it's shape. No luck. The sides on this one bulged badly, and seems larger than a typical 9 x 5 because the sides are perfectly straight. Most loaf pans are slightly flared. This is not. Anyway, I found the loaf of bread to be misshapen and have returned the pan."
1,not recommended,This pan warped the very first time I used it. I can actually hear the popping noise in the oven when it bends out of shape. It is becoming difficult to balance the food on it. I am looking for another pan but very difficult to find this smaller size.In addition it is difficult to clean. The non-stick coating also really holds onto the food/marinade stains.
5,Great!,My 3 year old loves these! They are an easy way to coax a reluctant bather into the tub. He likes to have a few at a time to mix the colors together. It took just a few baths to learn which colors are needed to make another color. I am restocking since we use so many.
5,Ohhhh Pretty!,"These are so cool! My daughter (2 1/2) loves these to death. I think the colors are vibrant and true to what the packaging says. It's especially cool to put a different color at either end of the tub and watch them meet and for the new color (we like red/blue = purple). I'll be buying more of these when we run out. Oh, and as other reviewers stated it hasn't left color on any washcloths, shower curtains/liners, or grout. :)"
5,Slicing Bread,"After buying a bread machine, we now no longer buy our bread. Everyone (children and adults) cuts their own bread, at the table, to the slice thickness they prefer. With my old bread knives, the slices quite often came out looking like an ocean surface (waves and all). After upgrading to this Henckel (to match my other Henckel knives), we can now all cut straight slices. It doesn't matter if the bread just came out of the bread machine (yum) or if the bread was baked yesterday. No longer is the French bread (hard crusts) squashed while we try to slice it. This is definitely the ""best thing since sliced bread""!"
3,2nd try,"I had to send my first set of covers back because I received 1 seat back cover and 3 seat cushion covers...2 of the 3 seat cushion covers appeared to be for my car and the 3rd was for something else altogether. I received my 2nd set today. The stitching on 1 seat back ""collar"" was coming apart but I was in no mood to return them again so I stitched it up myself using needle and black thread and actually did a better job that what was originally done. The seat cushion cover sides are not cut high enough on the sides to expose the electric seat controls. Oh yeah, same goes for the seat back covers and the seat latches on the sides of the headrest portion. Would I buy them again? No."
3,Wet Dreams (Erotic Classics),"Actually, 4 books in one omnibus. While they are all classic Victorian erotica, all 4 seem to have been written by different people. I was unfamiliar with the first two styles, but the third book, The Merry Menage, was very similar to Man With a Maid (even to the names!). I enjoyed the first three, but the last book was more about strict discipline - there was very little erotic about it."
1,More like a documentary about the Iditarod,"The synopsis states that this is a documentary about families living off the grid in Alaska. However, it's mainly a documentary about the Iditarod. There is very little focus on people actually living off the grid searching out alternative energy, water, and food sources."
1,College level amateur film makers first try.,"This appears to be an amateur film maker shooting 3 different random people over a few days, with seemingly no purpose or direction.Watching this video it about as lively and exciting as pulling out my old VHS home videos of Christmas Day, with the camcorder sitting on a tripod from the early 90'sOne person in the movie owns 64 dogs, and is seen standing around making a huge bowl of soup for the dogs.The other person is just hanging out at his one room shack, making coffee, bragging about how you have to snow mobile down a dirt road for 12 miles, then paddle up stream in a kayak for 9 miles, then home 4 miles to get to his cabin. And he just stands around and makes coffee over and over. With no insigh of how he even found this land, or ended up with it, how much he bought it for and when ? None of these questions were asked, just him sitting their looking at his coffee."
3,Tangerine - 'Memoire' (Spalax),"Originally released in 1976, as this was the obscure French folk-hippie rock ensemble's second of three albums. Nothing to get too excited about - but okay. Couple of the songs here I thought showed some promise were ""Ship To Mars"", the pop-oriented ""Unexpected Visitor"", ""La Source De Vie"" and ""Voice In My Mind"". Line-up: Andre Bouchaud - bass & vocals, Jean Pierre - electric and acoustic guitars, Marc Donahue - flute, sax, keyboards & vocals and Christian Schmid - drums & percussion. It's been noted the music here is more laid back than on their first lp 'De L'Autrue Cote De La Foret' ('75)."
3,"Great knifes, almost impossible to sharpen","(I say this with regret as I love the handle and balance of my Henkels chef knife). Henckels knifes are indestructable and I my experience (and I have heard this confirmed by a professional chef and cooking instructor) is that they are near impossible to sharpen. For many people this may not mean a lot, but a good knife should be able to have that remarkable edge for years (not just the first 3 mos). A professional may be able to sharpen these but not as well as other knives (e.g., Chicago Cutlery and others) -- no second honeymoons with these."
2,Don't Bother,"I love the previous books in the Bishop series, but could barely get through this one. The character development was very poorly done and characters that I have no idea why they were even introduced or what they had to do with the story. I mainly got fed up with all the psychic detail that went on and on. This felt like a short story that the author tried to stretch into a full length book. Very disappointing."
3,Not Kay Hooper's finest.,"I have read every book Kay Hooper has written and every book I have loved!! This one however, was very disappointing. If I wanted to know how the mind of a psychic works I would have bought a book on the subject. That was all this book was about. One murdered girl. Two dead bodies. Oh what a disappointment this book was. Save your money. Wait till it comes to the library. Hope her next one lives up to her usual standards as the best in Suspense."
1,What was she thinking?,"This is the worst Kay Hooper book I have ever read. I have read all of her psychic/serial killer books and they were great. I don't know if she was having a bad time with this one or what, but I could have done a much better job! This book had so much potential for a kick ass book and it fizzled out before it even got started. If this is your first Kay Hooper book, give her another try with ""Sense of Evil"" or ""Out of the Shadow"" series. Those were fine writing skills. If you simply must be read it, try and find a used copy and don't waste your $$ on a new copy!"
1,Text book material,"This wasn't a suspense novel, but a text book on psychic abilities. Way too many details on psychics and what they may or may not be able to do. I lost the story trying to wade through the text book material and so many ""whodoneit and why"" assumptions thrown at the reader. Did Kay Hooper write this book? I don't think so. Bring Kay back!"
1,Terrible Mystery,"I listened to the 10-disc book on tape rather than reading the book. I only finished it because once my wife and I got to the 2nd-3rd disc and realized how bad it is, we felt we had come far enough and should finish it.I can honestly say this is one of the worse mystery stories I have ever heard. My wife reads a ton of mystery/detective novels and agrees.Slow, boring, and the author keeps reitereating the psychic aspect of the characters and totally beats it into the ground. Do not read this book. It is absolutely ridiculous."
2,Had promise - but died,"I couldn't sleep the other night and picked up Sense of Evil. In the past I have liked all of Kay Hooper's books so I figured it was something that would keep me absorbed. I have to admit that I had to force myself to put it down in order to get some sleep, but on picking it up the next day - it seemed to lose something as the story progressed. In finding out ""who did it"" I was totally disappointed and felt totally cheated. Upon finishing and closing the book I felt like I had wasted my time reading it. This is not one I would recommend. I don't know why the publishers felt this one was worth publishing in hardback."
4,Good read,"This was the first book by Kay Hooper I've read, so I can't compare this one to others by her. Suffice to say that I thought this was a good read. I liked the psychic concept and the storyline but felt the characters weren't developed well enough to decide whether they were likeable or not. Also, there seemed to be more discussion among the characters about why and what than there was action, which made the story lag at times. Killer also wasn't much of a surprise - I think it's been done before.Will I read more by Ms. Hooper? Sure."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I have been a fan of Kay Hooper for many many years and have always enjoyed her work. However, this book was a complete disappointment. I found the characters in this story to be totally devoid of emotion, even when they were sharing their personal horror stories. I also found that most of the dialog was repetitive and easily skipped.I hope readers new to Ms. Hooper's work will not base their opinon on this one book, but will try many of her other works."
2,Disappointed,This started out to be something good. But it quickly fell into the formulaic too stupid to live big misunderstanding type plot. I lost interest fast and never really cared about the characters or why they made the choices they made. Lust is not love no matter how hard the characters say that it is.
1,Most craptacular fan EVER,"I've been through six, yes kids, SIX of these fans in the last four months. They are utter crap. Remember when fans used to last years, not weeks? Well, then whatever you do - don't buy a Lasko. And their customer service is HORRIFIC!!! They actually told me to disasemble my fan, hunt down a box, PAY to ship it back to them and then, if they thought it warrented (despite that it was still under warranty), they'd send me a new one. What the?!? SO, let me get this right geniuses at Lasko... You expect me to spend my precious time finding a box, stuffing this frickin' fan into it, and then paying UPS $20 to send it to you?!? So you can tell me that it's not your fault it broke in the first place?!? The fan cost $35!!! I might as well chalk up my experience that LASKO FANS SUCK and move on to another brand... Save your money!"
1,Flimsy and top heavy,"If I had the choice, I would have gladly paid more and not bought this fan. I had to use clear wide tape to hold the fan grill on, that alone shows the quality."
2,Loud,Just recieved my fan today. The guard is a bit of a pain to assemble due to it being warped. It still doesent mate up on some areas of the fan. My biggest complaint is the noise. At the lowest setting it will knock papers off a table 20 feet away and is loud enough where you have to turn tv etc.. up to hear over the noise of this fan. I don't know why they can't make a fan where low is actually low.
2,Very cheap,"This fan is very cheaply made and while it assembles ""easily,"" one of the pieces was VERY difficult to make stay in place! The least movement of the fan kept making it fall off! At least it does run properly, but I have to be careful not to bump the fan or the piece will most likely fall off again and I'll have to take it apart yet again to put it back together! I wish I had spent more money and bought a fan with better quality."
1,"Awful, both of them...",This is my second time writing a review for these awful fans. I guess they did not like the fist enough to post it?? They are complete garbage and not worth half the cost. Save yourself the time and aggravation and buy something with perfect ratings. One fan showed up with a broken blade (Quality control) although the box it was in was in perfect condition? The other only works if you angle it straight up at the ceiling??? And kick start the humming motor with a pencil. They are both loud and you would not want them in a bedroom unless you wanted to blow air (straight up at the ceiling and have a pencil handy. Do I even have to give them 1 star?
5,Powerpuff Girls a Big Hit!,This was my 6 year olds first game for her gameboy. She loves it! It was an easy game to learn but still challenging for her even after playing it for a month. For a young powerpuff fan this is wonderful!
3,Smaller than expected,"I was disappointed when I opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than I expected it to be. My friend's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger. Apparently there are two different kinds, one made by Playhut and one made by The Disney Store."
2,surprisingly small and poor fabric,This product is so small and the fabric is very odd - a complete disappointment.
3,engrave,"These are well made sockets, clearly marked with big markings, but why not also engraved??The case they come in is huge, and not a problem if you have a giant tool box with plenty of space to hold the case. For most, space is a premium, so a 1/2"" socket rack is the better option.My biggest problem, is that they are not engraved. The painted on coating and markings will in time wear off and become illegible. For me, I only got this set in metric. My sae set is proto, which are engraved. If I had all ir sockets, then in the future after all the markings have worn off, figuring out how to put them away after a heated frustrating repair which left me with a pile of tools all mixed up, that would be a problem. Now what, measure each socket with calipers, one at a time, then put them away one at a time?"
3,Melanie Denholme - star of the future,"Melanie Denholme is definitely beginning to grow on me, or maybe it's just a rash. So why do bad things always happen to pretty girls? In this case, one snakebite leads poor Melanie down a very dark path involving continuous and seriously sensual writhing, a skill she excels at, along with some effective fem-dom action. A one-location, one actress tour-de-force, this reminded me a lot of Polanski's Repulsion. This was a tough assignment, carrying an entire film alone, but lucky for the filmmakers and for us, Melanie is entirely up to the task."
5,It's simple and it works.,"I'm now liking the griddle side more than the grill side. Somewhere I read that some buyers of this or a similar product soon got a crack in their grill. I've not had any problems and from what I've seen if it's a genuine Camp Chef product and not a knock-off, the company would likely stand behind it. (I have no connection to the company; they just gave me good service on another small matter.)"
4,Good Service,I got good service and the product was as advertised but I found out that I could have gotten it for $10.00 less locally. Oh Well!
5,Kidde CO Detector,Excellent service from vendor and great price. Wanted to replace what we had exactly so as not to have to drill new mounting holes or touch-up paint because of different size. Exact;y what we nedded and arrived in three days.
1,False alarms! Even outdoors!,"I replaced the three AA batteries with three fresh ones and put the battery cover back on -- and the alarm went off. Four beeps every five seconds, the warning of carbon monoxide. Just to make sure it was working OK, I removed and re-inserted the batteries, and got the same results. I tried the ""Reset"" button, but it did nothing. I moved from room to room in the house, and the alarm kept going off. I went outside in the fresh air, nice breeze. The alarm still sounded. I re-inserted the batteries again, same results. I want to throw it away now, since it obviously doesn't work, but I wonder if it contains any environmentally hazardous materials."
2,A bland recording,"Angela Gheorghiu possesses a very dark, rich soprano voice. She's a full lyric soprano with an extremely mature sounding voice. Why does she try to sing Norina, Nanetta, and Giulietta? These roles don't fit her voice! She sounds too big for them. Her Norina lacks sparkle; her Nanetta lacks magic; her Giulietta is the most acceptable of the three but not ideal. Gheorghiu places the voice very far back, and her tone has a very covered quality about it.She is lovely as Mimi, especially in her moving ""Donda lieta."" She is melting as she sings, ""Badda!"" The aria from ""Cherubin,"" that delightful rarity, is also very well done and she shows off a fine trill.""Il est doux; il est bon"" suits her but there is no emotional involvement so what does it matter? I think that she could have pulled off a nice ""Jewel Song"" if she and the conductor could have agreed on a faster tempo; it lacks sparkle.Try either the ""Puccini Experience"" or ""La Rondine"" to hear Gheorghiu at her best. This CD isn't it."
3,Good only if at a bargain,"In as far as it goes, this is a fun book with lots of humor and insights into this great TV show. The main complaint I have is that it stops half-way through the run of the show and much is missing regarding the later seasons. I wish they produced an updated edition. Worth the money if you only liked the first half of the show or get it at a bargain price."
2,It's Just a Honing Steel,"Make sure to read what Amazon's editorial reviewer says. Most people think that ""sharpening"" steels sharpen. They don't. They hone or straighten the edge. For a dull blade, you need a good diamond-impregnated steel. After I got one of the latter, I hardly ever use the Henckels steel. Henckels knives have a pretty hard edge which, in my experience, tends to dull more than bending. The Henckels honing steel will sharpen the knife, but only slightly, and the ridges in the steel will quickly wear out if you use it for this purpose."
3,OK,This was an okay book but got a bit boring for me. It was recommended by a friend and I was a bit disappointed in it. It didn't hold my interest like some books and I almost stopped reading it.
2,"really raw crue, for the dedicated cruesters only!","poorly recorded, this is for the dedicated only. I really loved the crue in its heyday, but the recording on this release left much to be desired. Also, this is what Vince Neil's voice sounded like before he finished ruining it. Lots of double-tracking doesn't help much; sorry, Dude."
1,Everyone has a right to their opinion....,"THESE are Wy's influences? A depressing bunch of, ""oh, mah woman lef' me, so ah'm gonna git drunk 'n whine"" songs? What about Aretha? Tina? even (ugh) Melissa? I adore Wynonna, but this collection just further corroborates my hypothesis (and I've been a fan since 1975!) that Wynonna NEEDS Naomi, not just for the vocals, but for musical selection, too. But, HEY...I dig the Stones, Procol Harum, Mott The Hoople, Slade, Otis, even (they WILL get their rightful place in Rock and Roll History someday!) the Ramones. And Wynonna's successful, and I've been playing in a ghastly number of bar bands for 35+ years, so who's to say?"
3,Marine speakers,"I have had this product delivered to Florida and I will not be back there until October 2010. The box remains unopened for now. Hence, no rating on this item. I see that to review as requested, I have to rate, so I am choosing the ""OK"" for now."
1,I've used Henckel knives for years,"I still have two old Henckel knives and still love using them, but these newer versions leave a great deal to be desired. The steal is very thin, the blade bends very easy, the handle is done well, but overall cutting is difficult even with soft fruit life an apple. Go buy the Wusthof Classic 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife instead. Its a much better knife and cuts like a dream."
3,Henckels Four Star Gets Three,I found this item to be very useful. It is a well balanced knife that retains its sharpness.
4,Great Overall Soccer Training DVD,"Good information for all soccer players who take the game seriously, covering a complete fitness training program and many technical drills.The exercises were well demonstrated and explained, including a great warmup routine. The workout programs provided were well structured, and the booklet included inside was a useful guide as well. I think some of the exercises seemed a bit advanced for younger players, but they did show beginner options. I also like that they talked about the importance of attitude and the ""psychology"" of playing well.There were alot of good drills introduced... I'm sure most players would see something here they hadn't learned before. There's so much info to take in on one disc! Had to come back to it to watch the second half.Overall, I recommend this DVD to other parents, coaches, or players as a decent resource covering several different elements of becoming a better soccer athlete."
2,Looking London Talking Tokyo,"Site says ""NEW"" item..but found the plastic cut and opened..when asked seller replied giving many reasons..like... to bring down shipping cost (how ?), or otherwise the price wont be so low ( does that mean give opened item saying NEW) or it was too late to update (we can wait) ...Though Product works well but i had given money for new item..!!! Who knows how long it will work..so think before you buy..opened item is called NEW here !!"
2,Not durable and fell apart pretty quickly.,Not durable and fell apart pretty quickly. Camera case is not sturdy - looks much better in the picture. Purchased this for a 4 year old and it was non-functioning in about 4 days. Was disappointed in the quality over all.
5,Awesome!,I never play such an exciting & realistic driving game before. This totally beats out the GT series! It keeps you busy on non-stoping driving excitment.
1,Sucs,This game sucks really bad. i do not recommend anyone to buy this game. you cant even go in reverse in this game and it glithes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,not a good value,"I bought this game thinking it would be a fun racing game...i spent [money]! u can race and gain points on a different section by causing crashes the crashs are really lame because random cars accedently hit other cars that has nothing to do with the crash, anyways its not worth the money rent it before you buy it, trust me."
4,The 50 bucks is the worth watching the crashes alone!!,"Great game. The crashes are realistically errie. The slow motion captures the horror & destruction of the crash. Great damage detail. The graphics are great. The speed of the cars are great. The way to get boost by doing dangerous stunts is also fun.So why did I give it 4 stars. Hmm...Not sure. Theres just somthing about the game that troubles me. I only played it a few times so my initial rating & opinion might change. The only minor flaw is, I think the crashes out weight the actually game experience & the competitveness of racing. The object is supposed to be finishing first not to see a slo motion crash. I wouldn't be suprised if others see this as gimmicky. Either way its great for the game & adds much excitment to it.."
3,"Fun, light, and entertaining!","I like the diary style of books for a change every once in awhile. I found this story very entertaining! It tells the tale of Betty getting through life, newly divorced from Mitch, and raising Molly, her pre-school daughter. Now what I just said may sound like a heavy topic, but this book gives it just the right treatment if you are looking for a light, laugh-out-loud approach to the situation. I read this book in one day and found it a worthwhile read! It's fun, light, and very entertaining. Not too much character development, but that is not the real purpose of the book. Also kudos to Mary Sheldon for the name-dropping of her dad, Sidney, in the book. Very clever and quite an honor for her dad!"
5,Letters Across the Divide,"Amazing book. Anyone that reads it will find it difficult to put down. I would personally recommend this book for personal use, but also for corporate use in diversity training. Emotional and educational. As you read these remarkable letters shared between two friends, you will examine your own life, both spiritually and emotionally.Never have I witnessed two people express their emotions and feelings in such an honest and open way. This book is destined to make the Oprah Winfrey Book of the Month Club."
3,"Arrived well packaged, and damaged.","We have a set of Henkel knives, and this was purchased as a replacement for the old 4 inch paring knife that went missing. It arrived in outstanding packaging (the damage was certainly not Amazon's fault), with poor quality control. There was a deep ding in the blade near the center of the knife. I was able to sharpen it out after about 15 minutes with a Chef's Choice sharpener, but in this price range, I expect the product to be high quality and carefully controlled as to what leaves the factory.It's a decent knife, but I will be switching brands after this. A $40 kitchen knife at this level should never have such a serious defect and make it past QC."
5,Very good book.,"This book seems very realistic: Lasky describes Harper exactly the way a normal, 14 year old girl my feel. The only question I have about this book is: is Delores Macuccho a real author? That thought has been bugging me or ages."
4,Details Beyond the Usual Lore,"Billy Haines stories crop up occasionally in the legends of Hollywood, but just as tales of his quips or conquests. ""Wisecracker"" filled in the details of an extremely interesting and ultimately inspiring life. I agree with other reviewers who were put off by the author's conjecture, but the later chapters of the book rely more on interviews from surviving friends and acquaintances - some quite well-known. Haines' ultimate creative achievements and his enduring relationship with Jimmie Shields are impressive. I would recommend this book to anyone with interest in the early years of Hollywood or the social interweave of names like Hearst, Davies, Crawford, Bloomingdale and Annenberg."
1,Aluminum Hard Case is junk,"The case does not account for the power button on the top of the Palm Pilot. Whenever the case is closed the power button is pressed and results in the battery running out every several hours. Complete junk, I can't believe that they actually sell this."
1,return with no credit,I returned the item after after contact with seller on 11/30. Tracking shows accepted. I have sent two emails requesting a credit as seller said would do. still not response.
3,Metal forming is a bit crude,The chrome finish seems OK but the fender wasn't stamped out under enough pressure and the sides have wrinkels. But it will have to do considering it's the only small fender like it I could find.
2,3 for Research; 1 for Sloppiness and Agenda,"This book on the financing of terrorism is an absolutely atrocious book. Dr. Ehrenfeld obviously has a political agenda she is trying to further here. The agenda is the extremist view that only the U.S. knows how to fight terrorism and those who do not fall immediately behind the Bush administration might as well be sharing a cave with Osama. This is wrong for so many reasons, not the least of which, as Iraq shows on a daily basis, the U.S. can not act alone and expect to succeed.The book is also full of spelling and other editing errors. Dates and figures are wrong, and she contradicts herself within the same chapter in several places.If you are interested in reading a book by an expert of terror financing, I would recommend you check out Douglas Farrah before you read this book. Save yourself the time and misery."
1,This Is A pretty bad game,"This game was fun while it just began, but after awhile you find it kind of frustrating because you can't do anything. The graphics are pretty bad, the plot is okay, the levels are not really fun and sometimes the characters are annoying. I would only recommend this game if you are good at solving 5000-piece puzzles."
1,Ty Licks Pee!!!!,I Hate Ty Because you jump like an idiot in the game and Ty Takes a crap when he dies. He SUCKS!!!!!
5,"Good size, quality pot.","I have had the 16 qt version for several years, and needed a slightly smaller one also. These pots heat well and are easy to clean. Good choice."
5,Farberware 12 Qt Pot,Purchased this for canning. Worked nicely!Very heavy and as long as your temp isn't too high will not stick.Was pleased with purchase.I wanted a 10 qt dutch oven for canning and soups too.Cannot find.Wish Farberware or Revere Ware would make!
4,12qt stainless steel stockpot w/ lid,It's heavy duty so when I use it for canning I don't get my jelly or tomatoes burnt on the bottom of the pot.
2,Disappointed,"This is the first Henckels knife I've been disappointed with. It's just not as impressive as the rest of the four-star line. It's OK, but for the price, I'm not happy. Bottom line, it's not sharp enough, not versatile enough, and not worth the price. It is an adequate slicer, but not the over-the top quality of the rest of the line, of which I am a huge fan."
1,DON'T know how these people are giving it 5 stars?,"I played this game once & it sucks. Unless this game grows on you, then maybe it fun after a million time, whacking someone with a hammer, what's fun about that? Unless these people are getting paid to write 5 star, this game rank among worst on-line gaming, who would want to challenge & admit to having this game? I might have not given it a chance but it wasn't worth it for me, maybe if it's free. I got it because it was on-line capable but after playing it, who would be on-line with it? Graphic is ok, but game play gets boring, only challege is trying to see the twirling girl naked! also... never."
5,Great For People With Small Hands,"Every knife I've ever had always felt too big. When a knife is too big for your hand you're not in complete control of the blade. That can cause accidents-cut fingers, and it just slows you down when you'd like to cut things up in a hurry. Well this knife is just the right size for someone with small hands. The length and weight are in perfect balance. This is a great knife."
4,I was there,"Pretty interesting reading the reviews. I was there at the time this was written. Rozz told his story to Melissa, in thoughts of co-writing the book. Melissa took notes from Rozz, then he must have pissed her off, she published the book without him. The writing is VERY clumsy, but it kind of gives it a Quentin Tarintino feel. It does describe an interesting time in Portland and rock history"
1,What a horrible collection of gossip. . .,"The author claims to have respect for Courtney's achievements, but every page of this book drips with scorn. At one point she wastes an entire page reviewing Ms. Love's appearance in a derogatory manner, only to report on Ms. Love's plastic surgery later in the book with even more scorn. Lady, make up your mind.At the beginning of the book she reports on her one-time co-author's scheming to make money off of Courtney's private thoughts, and then later describes said co-author's relationship with Courtney purely from his point of view, despite the fact that he is willing to say or do anything for the sake of publicity.The good parts: Nothing, really. Read the book by Poppy Z. Brite, if you want good."
5,"Beautiful girls, awsome custom Harleys!","The 2000 edition of Iron & Lace features sexy actress Jaime Pressly from Poison Ivy III -The Seduction and now staring in the new WB television show Jack & Jill. Jaime has also been featured in Playboy magazine, and the Playboy Newstand Specials. Together with Jamie are other beautiful models from Playboy and Perfect Ten magazine.

5,medal of honor and M of H (underground),I love this game I finish the first two edition in PS1 and am looking Frontline edition but in PS1 I hope all Medal of Honor could have in PS1 I hope soon you I'll order to continue my playing past time.. thanks
3,Not so hot,"I got this game for Xbox a little while ago and at first liked it, but now I realize that it's a piece of junk. It's like one man(you) versus the entire nazi army. you barely ever get help from your men, except in a few missions. I highly reccomend Call of Duty instead of this"
5,Realistic War Action via unclear instructions,When I first got this game I thought I'd never get off the beach but I did and am now trapped in the level of trying to sabotage the sub pens. Seems like too many enemy for me to handle but this is very real. Outnumbered and at times out gunned. Instructions could be a little better with a more clear idea of where things are but still It's great to play and talk about time flying by. Buy it you'll like it.
4,its a great game but a couple of flaws,Its a great game to have but you might want to rent it before you buy.One of the flaws is if your like an arms length away from an enemy your bullets pass through him.If you can find it for less than 20 bucks (like on amazon)then definetly buy it.But otherwise head to blockbuster to rent it.
2,"Good, could be great but misses in a few key areas","Great premise. FPS set in World War II during and right after D-day. Great weapons. Lots of variety and you can carry many different weapons at one time. (A drawback to Halo.) Some of the mission, like the house-to-house fighting are great. Really intense with a lot of action but also the need for good tactics.On the negative side: The graphics are really weak. This game fails to make the most of the Xbox's capabilities. Also, because there is no gore in this game, it can be hard to know whether you've hit someone: you can spray a German with machine gun fire and then have to wait a couple of seconds to see whether they fall over. Also, the physics engine is pretty weak, or at least seems so because of the poor graphics. There is no sense of depth perception.In sum, great idea, fair execution, pretty fun to play but could have been great. Really a shame they didn't put the effort into the graphics."
4,BETTER THAN IT'S SEQUAL,"This along with Halo is perfect for a FPS single player GAME. This has multiplayer and it's mediacore. This is all shooting enemies , pushing switches and shooting out of vehicles, so you can't drive vehicles like in Halo.This has to have the best begining in a game along with Halo. D DAY mission is great but could of been alot more better than the PS2 mission. They improved it by adding more tank stoppers and there are not enough of your people and the level feels empty, when you go running onto the beach you only get shot and why won't the opponents shoot the rest of the men on my team. It should of been like Saving private Rian with more people.You'll have fun on this for a couple of months if you've never played the game before. This has good music, atmosphere and the Sniper Rifel is very good."
1,"Very, Very dissappointed","Wow, this game could have been sooooo good. But once again we have a failure. I have been playing the game for about two hours and i am already sick and bored with this game. The multiplayer is just horrible, i could run around in the woods with a stick and hit my friends and have more fun. Then we come to the single player mode. This is always the redeeming factor for all of these games that fail in multiplayer, but not for this one. The missions are ambigious and you have no idea where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do. This game is easily the worst game that i have ever played and should be avoided like it carried a rare strain of the ebola virus. If you bought it sorry, and if you didn't, pat yourself on the back and go buy a real game like ghost recon, unreal, or halo."
4,"Great soul, little gospel","This is, as one would expect from Soul Jazz, a top flight compilation of 60's and 70's soul music. Many of the artists here have/had close connections with gospel music, and its influence can be heard to greater and lesser degrees in these tracks. But there is little actual gospel here and God barely gets a look-in. A more accurate title would have been Gospel Soul. For some real ""soul"" gospel, listen to Aretha Franklin's Amazing Grace. Or get a sense of this genre's progression over time in Rhino's excellent compilation: Testify! The Gospel Box. If your taste is a little more adventurous, don't miss Tompkins Square's phenomenal compilation, Fire in My Bones: Raw, Rare & Otherworldly African-American Gospel, 1944-2007."
5,Great ONE person tent!,"This is a great little tent. Perfect for one person. I am 6' 2"" and with a sleeping bag and some gear, no way you get two in this. Unless you are in a relationship:-) But for my needs it works perfect. Packs up small and sets up in 10 minutes. If you are shopping for a tent that fits two comfortably, go for tent made for four. Having the option on this tent to leave solid shell off and sleep with just the netting over you will be perfect for summer camping. Again....great tent.....built for ONE!"
4,Good Value,"The tent held up very well on my trip. The only challenge was the rainfly. It never appeared to fit right, but that could be user error. Good product."
4,Kept me dry,"This was a nice tent. We got it, because someone had set it up in the snow and posted pictures of it on here. It was a decent price and a very vibrant color (easy to find in the dense woods, when you have wandered off to your potty destination). Super easy set up. KEPT ME VERY DRY!!! It rained all night and we didn't get wet at all. Although this was a great tent, that came with a lifetime warrenty, It did feel a little cheap in some areas. I didn't like that the area where the tent fastened to the poles, was just a clip and the flooring felt very thin. We set up a tarp under the tent and got extra clips.Overall, great tent. Would definately tell others to buy it!"
4,Great Little Tent!,"I LOVED this tent. Took it for 2 nights in the Hoh Rainforest and several nights on Washington's Olympic Peninsula and it worked beautifully for 2 campers. When backpacking we just split the weight between two people and it was no problem at all. It really isn't very heavy to begin with though. Kept us dry, warm, and happy in everything from sunshine to absolute downpours in the rainforest! If you are on a budget this is a GREAT tent for very low cost!"
3,It's OK!!,I don't think I can tell any different from Bengey. I will try to look around to see more stronger one....
1,Broke after 2 swings!,Didn't even get it out of the house! Broke in the living room when 4 year old hit it with his second swing.
1,It WILL break!,Lasted my 3 yr old one month before it broke for good. During that time we were constantly putting it back together. Not worth it! Spend the $ on a better quality one.
3,"Marie, it doesn't hold up.","I also loved this book as a teen-ager, and I hoped that at least some of the magic I'd found as a 17 year old remained. But it doesn't. Not enough history; too much about Katryn's internal thoughts, and yet without giving any real indication of her character or personality. I gave it three stars instead of two for sentimental reasons. I just couldn't give a book that gave me so much pleasure three decades ago a low rating."
2,Disappointing,"We got this for our sons for Christmas based on the great reveiws that others had given it and were disappointed. The car jumps the track frequently before completing one go-round. Some of the track pieces do not fit together well, which effects how smoothly the car can go. The track is so light weight that it does not sit flatly on the ground as shown in the photo. Both our 5 and 9 year olds have set it aside."
3,Darda Overpass,"After doing the research, the durability is as expected. Kids like it, but don't expect it to be the hit for much longer. Usually fix that by putting it away for a few months and then bringing it back out again."
4,"OK So I'm a ""Traditionalist""","OK, So I'm a ""Traditionalist"" - whateverThis is an excellent knife, as a culinary student I get to play with huge varieties of knives the college makes available to us, and while this is one of my favorites, the Wusthof beats it by a long shot. There's just something to be said for traditional forging methods, there's a feel to it that you just cant beat with super-hi-tech invisible welding magic. Can't really say exactly what it is, but my old-fashioned preference is the only reason it got 4 stars. Still an excellent knife though, beats the hell out of the cruddy stamped one I have at home."
3,"A needed book for grooms, but misses the mark","One of the first suggestions in this book's ""Do"" list is ""Maintain a sense of humor."" Kind of hard to do reading this. It's stoically written, even the part on bachelor parties, and there are repeated suggestions to buy these folks' other products (like ""Responsibility Cards""). On the plus side it's a very quick read and there is some concise, useful information, such as the Wedding Formation section... but not enough to warrant a full recommendation."
4,"Nice, pocket-sized quick guide to Groom's part in theWedding","This is a good guide to the wedding process for the Groom. It has everything from an illustration of the processional, to who is responsible for what, and finally a check list for the Budget. I appreciated the listings of what to take to the church and Do's and Don't lists, as well. A really well done guide that includes a surprising amount of information in a usable format that isn't likely to scare off the average Groom... I plan to give it to everyone I know who gets married..."
1,Didn't have the item,We ordered this item over a week ago to celebrate Christmas tonight with my roommates. The Gift was PERFECT for a housemate... although it turns out this company doesn't even have the item and cancelled our purchase TODAY. So thanks for nothing.
3,Not well made for the price,"I agree with the first reviewer that my daughter loves to put these in her mouth. But the paint doesn't stand up well to this treatment. Although it doesn't flake off, it scratches fairly easily. We haven't had these blocks very long and a couple of them are very scratched already. Not what I would expect for the price, although they are very cute."
1,Bad,"The item was advertised as ""like new"" and it was only in fair condition with a lot of wear and numerous highlights!!"
4,I very good text,"I thought this was a very good text, has a great online resource also. Be sure to take the sample tests online, to see where you need to study a little bit more."
5,12 Stages of Healing,It is a fantastic book. I am so grateful for the knowledge and stories that have been imparted. It has made a positive impact in my life.
4,"Great sound, just uncomfortable to wear with sunglasses or glasses","I live in Colorado where it's sunny pretty much every day. So I wear sunglasses all the time. These earphones sound amazing (as you would expect with B&O;) but the ""hook"" that secures behind your ear is a nuisance if you wear sunglasses and/or glasses. It's quite uncomfortable actually.I still give these a 4-star rating because of the amazing sound quality and flexibility and articulation of the actual ear piece. It allows you to get an exact fit to your ear (preventing leakage) or allows you to slightly pull the earpiece off your ear a bit to ease up on the eardrum.I'm amazed at how low of a frequency these little ear pieces can actually register. You're not going to get ""thumping"" base out of them, obviously, but the lows they do produce are very rich and clear.I like 'em... just wish it wasn't so uncomfortable wearing with sunglasses."
4,nice knife,I will admit that this is the most expensive knife I've ever purchased. I baby it and demand that everyone else in my house do the same. However it does cut very well. I've had it for over six months and haven't needed to sharpen it yet. I have passed it over the rod a few times and it brought the edge right back. I do like it.
4,Kitchen knife.,"The Henckels Twin Pro S is my favorite kitchen knife... I've had one for many years and it was always my ""go to"" knife in the kitchen. Perfect, medium size for slicing meats or vegetables or most anything. The handle is comfortable and the blade length is just right. The only point I would add, is the knife does need to be sharpened occasionally for best performance. I recommend a good knife sharpener like Chef's Choice to use, and the knife will give years of great service."
4,very good milky tea,"As an avid milky tea drinker, I find a tea I like, drink it 3 -5 times a day for years then tire of it suddenly and change.I can only review flavor.For years, I varied between Earl Gray, Lady Jane Grey and Constant Comment. Then I fell in love with Chai, but found some chais too strong.This chai was a good introduction for me.One benefit of chai is less sugar is required. The vanilla helps to soften the cinammon flavor."
5,Best Chai Tea I've Tasted,I love this tea. This is a wonderful chai blend that's good hot or iced. I use it in my iced tea maker. It's a big hit with our family. Buying it in bulk through Amazon is far more cost efficient than trying to purchase them as single boxes in a health food or grocery store.
3,Humourous but rather unstructured,"To those not familiar with the writings of Kurt Vonnengut this is not a good starter. Go buy Mother Night or Slaughterhouse Five instead. If you are familiar with Vonnengut, you will probably also enjoy this book.As always the sarcasm and humour is worth it all. But the story of this novel is really hard to keep track on. It seems more like a collection of notes than a novel proper. Obviously this means that this book will primarily be of benefit to dedicated fans, such as myself."
2,It's a big disappointment and goes nowhere,I am a big fan of Vonnegut's most famous books but found this dull and pointless. By the time I reached the end I had no idea why I was reading it.
3,A dissappointment to Vonnegut fans,"I'm a big Vonnegut fan. I love his writing style, his subtle humor, and most of all his commentary on the world we live in. I dove right in to Hocus Pocus and was excited to follow up my read of Cat's Cradle. I was greatly disappointed! This is definitely not one of Vonnegut's better works. His style was probably the most consistant factor - it was certainly ""Vonnegutesque"" - but this book was not as funny or relevant as his others I have read. Of course, it was still good. I give it three stars because it was a worthwhile book in its own right. The plot was interesting, if particulary slow, and the prespectives on war, the educational system, nationalism, and more were unique. But if you go into this book expecting another Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, you're going to be disappointed."
3,Needs improvement,"The guys in Stavesacre have been around, for a long time.Yet this sophomore effort just doesn't have any punch. Colt .45 is a great song, but other than that, I'm left feeling empty.It's wierd, but upon listening to this, I just know that they can do much better than this.It's a good cd though, but it just doesn't live up to its potential. They don't work with the poor vocal ability. Instead, they put it out in front, where it doesn't need to be."
5,Celestial Sounds,"There is no doubt that Beethoven was a master in music. This 9th Symphony is a real piece of art that will always be recognized as one of the most superior musical works ever written. In his later days, while he was deaft, Beethoven wrote this excellent and last symphony which adds the most beautiful of the instruments, the human voice. It is extraordinary to listen to these great melodies from the only God-made intrument. This symphony is one of the greatest and has been listened in all the parts of the world. It enchants our consciousness to takes us to the most beautiful and unimaginable places where melody is the king. A must-have in the CD rack to enjoy anytime and to find how beautiful music can be in its ultimate structure with all the beautiful intruments available at that time. After you listen to this, you will think of something else when you hear the term ""Classical Music"""
3,"Cheap plastic, but entertaining","This is my second one. The other broke rather easily, but these are really nice for kids on a trail-a-bike where there is little likelihood of smashing it.I wouldn't put them on a kids bike or they would get broken easily.I wish there was a metal edition, but there isn't so these have to do."
4,"very pretty, but a bit expensive","We bought this bedding set for our first child, born 8 weeks ago. It's a beautiul set and is very attractive in the crib. I hung the comforter on a quilt rack beside the crib and everyone who comes to visit our son comments on how lovely it is. We only bought the bedding and an extra valance for the window, but there are lots of nice extras that match this set, and it is easy to match if you want to buy less expensive accessories (as opposed to the ones that are part of the arcadia set). What we love is it's perfect for a boy or girl and the animals are just adorable.However, now that I'm out of the pregnant and nesting stages, I wish that I'd listened to friends and bought a less expensive set. It's very pretty, but not terribly practical."
1,CHOKING HAZARD>>>>DO NOT BUY!!!,"I received the set right after my daughter was born. She is now 8 months old. I put her down for a nap and about a half hour later I heard her gasping. I ran into her room and picked her up when she was choking. Something came up and I looked into her mouth and saw something blue. I pulled it out, it was a piece of yarn that she pulled off of one of the designs on the bumper. The set is nice for decorative purposes, but if you get it, please do not use the bumper! We are getting a breathable bumper to replace it."
5,Bumper ideas?,"I love my Arcadia bedding set, but my pediatrician said not to use the bumper due to the risk of SIDS... Does anyone have any ideas of how else I could use it? It's so cute I'd hate for it to go to waste."
5,Outstanding!,I read the last book in the series first. Liked it so much I went and read the first two books and then this one again. This writer has a way of pulling you into his stories so that you can't put the story down until you finish it. I hope to read more of this author's works!
4,Wonderful!,My four year old son went out to our garden to start planting seeds as soon as we finished reading it the first time. And the second time. He still likes reading it and so do I.
1,Garbage! Don't waste your money,"I bought this for our three-year old daughter. This product is not made for a three-year old as the headpieces do not fit properly into the actual head. My daughter became frustrated trying to play with this toy so her 10-year brother tried to help her out. He couldn't even get the head pieces to fit. You have to force the piece into the head by squeezing the plastic and forcing it in. Decided to throw the whole thing away after my finger was pinched between the forehead and the headpiece. Again, Don't waste your money!"
4,"good, but too verbose","Overall, it's a good book on jsp (I got the ebook version early on). But it's a little too verbose at times. I feel that the authours could have covered the same material in half to two-thirds of the current number of pages. I guess that the authors may be not so sure about the progrogramming skill levels of their audiences, or as they state in the book that this book is trying to serve both page designers and Java programmers. So they choose to explain stuff that experienced programmers know."
3,Worth getting,"If you're new to JSP technology (and already understand HTML, javascript and CGI concepts) then this is an excellent book to start with. It's a ""next step"" beyond the standard HTML, and begins by covering the technology and differences between JSP and CGI. Then it steps into the different components that make up JSPs, and finally real examples.The book finishes with a 3-chapter overview of Tag Libraries, but since this isn't the primary focus of the book (and is really its own subject) it doesn't cover the subject adequately and did cause some confusion.There are some errors in the book (lack of definition between jsp:includes, directive.includes and jsp:forward for example), but with some experience this book can become a good reference."
1,Practically Useless,"This book is subtitled, ""A practical guide for designing and building dynamic web services"". Yeah, right. Although the book is aimed at beginning to intermediate JSP developers, the authors fail miserably to communicate to their target audience. Basically, you'll find yourself re-reading section after section, wondering what the authors are trying to say, and why the book is so chock full of Java code listings, with only a smattering of JSP. Other books handle the learning curve of JSP much more effectively. In fact, you're better off just using any of a number of tutorials on the Internet for learning the basics and intermediary aspects of JSP. What the authors should have done is follow the lead set with 'PHP and MySQL Web Development'. In this case, the ""practical guide"" was practically useless."
2,"Cute but useless, even malfunctioning parts","At first glance, the kit is very helpful, providing everything in one box (minus the fish): an aquarium, silk plant, filter, food, water conditioner, and even gravel. However, the filter is a pathetic excuse of machinery that doesn't do it's job. It doesn't come with an air pump so the fish will start going up for air and will probably die in a few hours of being placed in the habitat. The gravel is cheap plastic coated things that could do harm to the fish when the smaller pieces float up. So the only good thing about it is that it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye -if dead floating fish is fine with you."
1,A Really Lousy Book on the Topic,"What can I say? It's one of the worst tech books that I've ever read.The author does not have a basic knowledge of Threading. After section 2.2, I could not go on any more.It's a very good subject, but this book ruined it."
5,good lesson,Any little boy who loves dragons and knights will be enthralled with this story. The message is great too. The squire is greatly rewarded because he remembers the words on the scroll (the Word) and it allows him to overcome evil. Lots to talk about after you read it with your kids.
1,These knives cannot even cut through butter...,"Two months ago I purchased this steak knife set to add to my extensive collection of J. A. Henckels knives. I based this decision off of my satisfaction with their knives in the past and on the reviews from this website. Within the first two weeks I had one knife break while cutting butter (and I mean that literally). A few weeks later another knife broke while attempting to cut a vegetable. I am extremely dissatisfied with the lack of quality in this product. I am not sure whether they are producing inferior goods, have a quality control problem in their facility, or whether this was just a bad batch. I have stopped using the knives out of a safety concern and have returned them to the manufacturer. I am not sure how they will handle it (since I bought from Amazon), but at the very least I asked for a new set of knives. Maybe I'll give them all the ""butter test"" when they come in..."
1,Horrible quality,"I washed it to get the stale smell out and I have white lint everywhere and on everything that I washed with it. Even when I put it on, it still sheds lint. Very disappointed in this purchase."
5,Best gift ever,I got this knife as a wedding gift 7 years ago in a set and have been using it every day...at least twice a day and it is just the best! Only after 6 years did I need to use a stone to sharpen them. I really only needed the sharpening steel. I love to cook and this knife makes prep easier and faster. It is well balanced and solid to hold without being too heavy. The only thing i noticed about the blade is that when i slice turmeric it sometimes stains the blade...but it comes out after 3 days or so of using and washing (hand wash only). I highly recommend this knife.
3,Okay but could have been better,The first thing that I noticed about this book is it had a lot of pictures and not alot of info on how to airbrush t-shirts. However I did find the book useful in creating new designs and to know what needed to be done and in what order. Over all it is a good book to get you exited about airbrushing on textiles but doesn't give you enough information on on to do it.
1,Disk full of errors,"The Quizes on the disk are full of errors, wrong answers, that should have been caught by proofreading.The chapter on ""information processing"" is especially poorly organized and it is even hard to tell where one theorist ends and another begins."
5,Long lasting,This knife has last us a long time and is still going strong. Lightweight and super sharp in its stainless steel material. Doesn't get any better.
5,The best!,"This knife is the best investment you will ever made. Everyone knows that a sharp sturdy knife can go a long way--this product is just that. It's easy to handle, easy to clean, easy to chop, etc. Simply perfection!"
5,Great performance at a great price,"I am a big fan of more expensive Henckels knives, but decided to try out this knife based on recommendations from one of my favorite cooking shows, America's Test Kitchen, as I never seem to have enough chef's knives in the house. Wow, were they right. Knife has a study handle fit, is well balanced between blade and handle, easy to clean and most importantly delivers precise cuts. I still love my Henckels, but am also pleased to have a high quality but much less expensive Victorinox in my knife drawer."
5,love this knife!,I love this knife. its the finest piece of cutlery I own. It is so sharp and easy to handle for such a low price.I cant believe it it cuts like a much more expensive knife. i seen it on Americas Test Kitchen show and ordered it right away. Love it.
5,Love it!,I did the research so I knew what to expect and it hasn't disappointed. Cut my first chicken with it and it was a breeze! What I didn't know is that this handle is better for dishwasher use than the rosewood handles. I believe the Fibrox grip would be better also it's like non-skid material used on Navy Ships just not abrasive.
5,Very Good Knife for a Very Reasonable Price,"I will admit to being somewhat of a ""knife snob."" I have been using Henckels and Wusthof knives for years, and thought you had to have a high-end forged knife to get good results. Boy was I wrong! I have to admit America's Test Kitchen and Cooks Illustrated to got this one right. This knife rocks! For a knife that sells for less than 30 bucks here on Amazon at the time of this writing, this knife is a steal.It is lightweight and has a very comfortable handle that is also very nonslip. The instructions say you can put in the dishwasher, but we will hand wash ours, like we do with all our other good knives. Mine arrived razor-sharp and passed the ""tomato test"" with flying colors. There is sufficient clearance between the handle and the blade so that, even with my ham hands, my knuckles do not hit the cutting board when using the knife.Bottom line: This is a very nice knife. Highly Recommended."
5,Favorite knife so far,"I purchased this knife for my mom to use after decades of inferior knives. I had purchased one of these for myself several years ago upon the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen. The knife performs wonderfully with excellent cutting and great grip with wet or gooey hands. Another relative has a more expensive knife that is well-built and would only surpass this knife in weight, but execution of tasks is comparable with the exception of the aforementioned grip where the more expensive knife would slip and is less hand-friendly."
5,Best ever,"I bought this knife for my son and daughter-in-law. I have had one like it for many years. It has good balance, cuts beautifully, and the handle material makes it easy to grip. I have knives that I paid 3 or 4 times more for that I never take out of the drawer. Just because something is expensive does not mean that it is better."
5,Great knife at a great price,"I bought this knife eight months ago and have loved it since the day I bought it. When I received it, it was so sharp that it could shave hairs off of my arm. For a stamped blade, it seems very strong and durable. I have not had any problems with rusting or dulling.The handle is not a cheap plastic handle, it is a durable textured handle that seems like it will last a long time. I also have the rosewood-handle version of this knife. While the rosewood looks nicer and seems more elegant, the Fibrox handle is more comfortable to use.Since buying this knife, I have also purchased the Santoku version, and the Forschner paring knife, both of which live up to the high standards set by this knife. I tend to use the Santoku version more, but this is just personal preference based on my style of cooking. All of the R.H. Forschner knives are great products at excellent prices."
5,Love this knife!,"We got this knife last year, and it is still my favorite knife! I use it for meat, veg, and anything that doesn't require serrated edge (ie. bread). It is sharp and durable. I hone it every few weeks, to ensure that it stays sharp. For $25, I can't think of a better knife. I love it more than any kitchen knives I've used. Definitely recommend. You won't regret it."
3,"Too Lightweight - Grippy Handle, Though","Personally, a knife is all about feel for me. With a plastic handle and thin spine, it was obvious this one would be light - too light, in fact, for me. The blade flexes a little, but I assume that would not be a problem for anyone. The one thing that impressed was the texture of the handle, which is superior to a smooth plastic/composite or polished wood surface for keeping a grip if the going gets greasy.While sharpening the blade with a honing steel, I noticed several rough spots on the edge after a short time of use, though a smooth edge did return after a few strokes on the steel."
5,Wonderful knife,"So good I purchased one for me, my girlfriend, and my mother. Dont need any other knife but this for basic chef work."
4,Great Knife,I love this knife. It stays sharp and fits great in my hand. I gave it a 4/5 because i'm used to more of a rocking motion when cutting. my old knife has a bit more curve by the handle.
2,Disappointment,"I ordered this knife based on the great reviews it got here. I was disappointed. The knife was not particularly sharp when it arrived, and sharpening it has not helped. It is unwieldy and cheap feeling. I have a slightly smaller chef's knife with a heavier handle that is vastly better and not much more expensive. Do not recommend."
5,"SUPER PRICE, SUPER KNIFE","Absolutely amazing knife for the price. I own several Hattori japanese damascus knives and while this knife does not carry the weight, it sure does have the same cutting ability. Right out of the package it is razor sharp. I not only ordered the Chef, but also ordered and 6"" boning flexible and the 8"" Santoku. I am very pleased with all three. Also, I ordered the 12"" Granton edge slicer. Have not had a chance to use the slicer, but if it is as sharp and comfortable as the others, then I know I have found me a very reliable and capable slicing knife. I smoke Pork Butts and Briskets often and can't wait to use this slicer. For those on the fence whether to purchase or not, do your research and you will quickly come to the same conclusion I did. For the money, you will not find a similar knives that these quality knives provide. Good luck and happy cooking and safe slicing, dicing and chopping................."
5,Slices through everything like hot butter,"I managed to cut myself twice before I actually used it. I didn't realize how dull my other knives were until I got this one. I've had it a month now, and love it. The edge is razor-sharp, and it cuts effortlessly through everything I've used it on. I plan to buy more sizes, now that I've fallen in love with this knife."
5,Cooking 101-- Knife Skills,"We've been wanting to invest in a good chef's knife for awhile-- except for the part where they cost over $100. Then I got the most recent copy of Cooking 101 and it rated the Victorinox knife right up there with the ""big boys""-- I was skeptical but at under $25.00 why not give it a shot? It's great... perfect for all types of chopping-- makes me feel like a pro and our knife sharpner guy says it will be easy to sharpen whenever that need arises."
5,Good Knife,"The PBS program ""America's Test Kitchen"" did an extensive test on chef's knives and this one came out the overall winner for performance and cost. I have found that to be true. Very nice to use."
3,"Good, not great","I bought this knife because it is highly recommended by America's Test Kitchen. It is very sharp, and light weight, dishwasher safe, and is a great value. I don't like it as well as my Wusthoff Grand Prix 8"" chef's knife. However, if you can't afford the Wusthoff, this is a good fall back. I also gave one of these to my daughter... she really likes it and it is a great improvement over the other chef's knife and santoku knife that she owns."
1,not what I expected,the knife looks and feels cheap. I won't be using it for cutting food. I asked for a knife in retail packaging so i know it's a genuine item in new condition. Instead i received it rolled up in cheap foam wrapping.
3,gave as a gift,"I gave this knife to my son. He says that he doesn't like the texture on the handle as well as his henkel knife, and because of that, he gives it a 3 star."
5,At this price - you will not find a better knife,"This knife sits in the drawer next to my heavier ""forged"" knives and I alway reach for it first. It is a lightweight knife, with a stamped steel blade, but I've never had a knife that held an edge so well or was as comfortable in the hand. If you prefer a big, heavy knife (like if you're a murderer) this probably isn't for you."
5,a super knife at a great price!,"I recently bought this Victorinox chefs knife from a recent review from Cooks Magazine. They were right it'san excellent knife for the price. You could spend much more for a knife this good, but why spend the money when this knife is so darn good!Thanks!"
4,Good knife,"It is good knife for the price , but don't expect its performance better than high end German and Japanese knife . Overall it is worth the money I paid ."
5,Love it!,"I bought this along with a knife sharpener. It was recommended on America's Test Kitchen as being the one they use. It is wonderful. I enjoy cooking much more because chopping is so much easier. The only thing is that the packaging is very hard to open (standard plastic zipped edges) and it so locked tight, that I nicked myself on the knife just getting it out of the packaging."
2,feminization of non-Christianity,"I agree with everything the writer of the ""Reader Beware"" review wrote.One thing that is certain, Podles has a gross misunderstanding of Christianity and Christian character. The fruit of the Holy Spirit that Christians are to cultivate are things like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness and gentleness. These are in direct opposition to the masculine qualities he advocates of assertive body language and aggressiveness.Another thing to be aware of for Evangelical Christian readers is that he does not address Evangelicalism and appears to have consulted no Evangelical sources.It is an important book because it is influential but it is not a good book."
4,Good... for Mucha fans.,"Not much to say about this book... I needed a few large Mucha prints and in that respect this book served it's purpose.Not even close to a full collection but definitely beautiful.Keep in mind, this is a book of his works... not much else in terms of content and history."
5,Love this knife,"I finally broke down after years of horriable knifes and bought some henckels. I must say i will never go back. This knife is very well balanced,fits comfortably in you hand, and is very sharp. When i tried it out for the first time i was amazed at how easy it was to slice and chop. It actually took about a week to get used to not having to saw through everything. I have been converted, no more crappy knifes for me."
5,Excellent addition to the kitchen...or the patio,"While I usually use the oven for most things that I use the roaster for, it does have some benefits over the oven.For the basics, it's a solid performer in what it does. The description of the product is accurate, and I think it's a great bonus if you need more ""oven space"" on occasion. The removable insert (that you cook in) is awesome as it makes clean up much easier.On top of that, if you do things like: roasting vegetables (say, for chicken pot pies), or want to slow roast ribs, this works much better (in my opinion) than the oven. I've even used it to make my Thanksgiving turkeys (leaving my oven free for other stuff). When I'm entertaining on the patio and have a lot of something that I want to cook or keep warm, this fits the bill perfectly. It also has more ""floor space"" than my largest crock pot, so meatballs don't need to be stacked before cooking."
2,broken display-block,"I've mount an external block and laser antena, than plug power to the indication block and.. what next - I've heard the sound of self-test but see no any visual indication - the display block does show me nothing, but sound. I've call my friend who works with electronics who said me that the quality of internal plate - the quality of soldering - of displaying block is very very poor."
3,"Good For Some, Bad For Others","Recently, my parents turned off my Nextel service because I had a 400 dollar bill. Obviously, I talk a lot. Going weeks without a cell phone led me to buy myself a t-mobiel prepaid phone. i bought the motorola V300 camera flip phone and a 10 and 50 dollar card, along with the intial 15 dollars included with the purchase of the phone. I solely bought a prepaid phone because I am 16 and I can not sign up for a monthly plan.However, after two weeks of talking on my phone I had already used the majority of my initial purchase. What I'm trying to articulate is that prepaid phones are extremely expensive for anyone who talks a lot.Anyways, I am very happy with my v300, it's a wonderful camera phone and there are many ways to personalize it. However, TMobile charges for text and picture messages and internet, where as Nextel did not.In total, I am relatively happy with my prepaid plan but very unhappy at how utterly poor I have become."
5,Great Product!,This is a great product. I had none of the difficulties the previous reviewer mentioned. My cholla wood shipped in no time and when I received it I was impressed. The piece was inside the stated measurements and looked almost exactly like the picture shown on the product page. My only complaint would be that it arrived in a 15x15x15 shipping box that was extremely too big for the wood piece. A smaller flatter box would have been nice and it would have saved a lot of packing material also. Overall this piece was exactly what I expected and my two hermies love it dearly as they are always climbing on it!
2,The most ridiculous heroine I have ever read so far,"The heroine, Katherine (or Danae), was an abused, ungrateful, exaggeratedly self-pity, blindly in doubt of her hero's feeling towards her. She did not deserve her hero. Sion was such an ideal man for Danae but he was so confused of the situation. I thought he would finally straighten out his ""lady Danae"", but not even for the sake of a bit of reality, the confrontation between the two just kept repeating towards the end of the book. At first I did not believe Sion would be that weak. Oh well, love is blind. I am an easy reader; I have read quite a few romance books and liked almost all of them. I could not believe that I so disliked this one. Although, her writing was pretty good."
5,if only it were a little longer,"My main complaint for this story is probably that it was a little too short.That said, it's been a favorite since I first got a copy over ten years ago.Acila has always been her (rather simpleminded) brother's keeper. Lord Ranulf, who has come to take over her home, recognizes her as a fellow shapechanger and, as could be expected, wants to marry her for her talent. Through cleverness and magic, Acila and her brother escape into the unknown world where, of course, her brother ends up as the Year King of a city where he will be sacrificed at the end of the year.The characters were well written and even the ones you rather disliked were well rounded enough to be likable, after all. With a fast paced plot and smart heroine, it was almost like one of those old fairy tales where the clever and steadfast heroine saves the day (rather then the hero.)"
5,Awesome!,"First off, its a Henckel set - if your looking at purchasing this item you will probably already know about Henckel being the industry standard.With simple rudimentary care in regards to hand washing, these knifes will last a lifetime. In addition, they hold a great edge and are easily sharpened with the included sharpener. This 9 piece set includes everything you need to be a weekend warrior chef. Sure, there are additional items one would need for setting up a true professional kitchen. But a chef of any caliber should love and cherish these beauties. And the discounted price is hard to beat - try purchasing these knifes individually and see what I mean.Thus, if you ready for a truly good set of knifes, use one of your old beat up knives to pry open your wallet - break out the credit card and fork out the dough for these. You won't be sorry!"
5,Looks funny but does a wonderful job.,I've used this knife way more than I thought I would. My one modification to this knife would be to introduce a slight curve to the cutting edge. The straight (unserrated) portion on the tip of the knife is handy for quick short cuts.
2,You Can't Really Make love this way...,"Some of the suggestions on this book can really turn off women. All women are different and not all women like these recommendations. I thought it would be good at first but after reading it. I was surprised at the recommendations. Women are definitely different and what works for the author here, does not work for me!!!"
5,A must buy!,"An album of subtle excellence, ""JCQ"" is a wonderful collection of smartly interpreted standards, and original compositions by a reed player with a seemingly limitless imagination. Jim and company have crafted moody, ethereal arrangements that allow for moments of playfulness and fit Jim's playful contralto like a velvet glove.My only wish is that the album didn't end so soon, I was so immersed in the sounds of Jim's reed play. Either in the home or driving in your car this CD is a mini vacation worth taking!"
3,My son loves them but...,I will not be purchasing this product again. I specifically ordered this product because I wanted a holder for the crayons. (There are enough loose objects in the house when a toddler lives there) I don't know the reason but the suction cups were actually stuck to the cardboard backing they came on and some of the paper is permanately stuck to the cups. Since they weren't sticking properly we attempted to scrub the remaining paper off the suction cups (which are super flimsy and thin) but it wouldn't budge. I can imagine in just a few weeks the crayons will have to be replaced as the stick isn't very long. Will purchase something different next time.
1,NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE,"The product itself is made well, however as a ""push"" broom for a child to use it is misrepresented. The handle does not tilt as it comes up from the from the broom so there is virtually no way for a child to ""push"" the broom with the bristles actually flat on the floor as they should be. I did however find a tilted version of a child's push broom at another web site called Montessoriservices.com and have purchased it for my child to use as he is very helpful and always tries to be. This broom that does not tilt is able to be used as a regular short broom for an adult which is always useful on an equestrian farm like we live on. We will keep it but it is not what I expected it to be, what I had hoped for or what it was claiming to be. Cyndee of Alabama"
5,Wonderful book,"This book is perfect for anyone who needs to write application software for GNU/Linux. It describes all those miscellaneous features for programming that are above the kernel but below the level of integrated development environments. It describes makefiles, gcc, debugging, object file analysis, sockets, pthreads, performance analysis and much more. The latest edition also has an excellent overview of virtualization.The author doesn't go into detail on any one subject, and that is what makes the book so good. I can find details in various online sources. This book is perfect for someone who had normal training in C/C++ and now needs to understand how to develop on a GNU/Linux system."
4,Very handsome classic shoe...,"A little stiff, considerable wear-in period, but comfortable and wearable. Classic beefroll details, leather sole and sock liner. I wear these with or without socks."
2,"Soles wore off, needed replacement, in less than 3 months.",I am fairly incensed about these shoes. The soles wore out - had a hole in them - in less than 3 months of normal everyday wear. Replacementsoles cost more than half of what the shoes cost in the first place. Won't buy another pair of them.
2,A few instrumental grooves NOT a great lost album,that other reviewer is right -- there are like 3 great tracks on this original album re-issue. So that's less than 15 minutes of good music. The liner notes make it seem like a must-have but most of the vocal tracks are just okay. NOT essential.
5,"Personal, thought provoking book without cliches","This was an excellent book that I encourage all Muslims and non-Muslims to read. As someone who became Muslim a few years ago, the book seemed to speak directly from my own personal thoughts and journey to Islam. Amazing book and entertaining too!"
2,Flop,"These Aerobies boomerangs have been a disappointment. The AerobieSuperdisks are beyond awesome. These are not in the same league. We have had a lot of folks try these with nothing close to a return. Now I am not Mr. Frisbee, but for me these don't work."
2,Never comes back,"Spent a while trying to get this to work and I could never manage to get it to come back. I followed the packaging with no luck. Will spend some more time with it though, hopefully I'll figure it out!Boomerang appears durable and it was made in the USA."
2,Not a great boomerang,"This product was vastly inferior to several wooden boomerangs purchased at the same time. Our family all had a hard time getting it to come back, whereas the wooden ones worked well."
3,Good luck catching this on return flight,"I've tried this product for hours with my 6 yo and after around 200 throws at different angles it came close to returning to us but, no way! Make sure you've got plenty a room to throw it."
5,Wasn't sure but now I love it!,"I actually first got this knife in a large set of Henckel knives. I absolutely love the knives, Henckel is as good as they get and I love the look and especially the feel of the Pro S series. I wasn't sure how I'd like the hook design but after using it I must say I absolutely love it. It works great for peeling (what its actually made for) but I also love to use it to cut and dice all sorts of things (pretty much anything smaller that I usually cut in my hands). They shape really helps cutting up or stemming things like Strawberries.If you like Henckel knives I'm sure you'll love this one."
4,Steak Knives,Product arrived on time and of the quality expected. Would really like it if they would offer in sets of 6 as well as 4.
1,Great if you only want a year,"I am on my 3rd unit. Every year like clock work this thing dies. Now, I do use it everyday, so it does get alot of use. But if you use it correctly, change filters and bags ect.. you should get more out of something. The only reason I am doing this again is because of the size. The unit is not as wide as other shop vacs and I only have room for this size."
3,Good DVD Player,"I was reading the reviews and D. Casad is frustrated about the black screen and sound issue with this DVD player. I had the same problem and called Toshiba. If the battery is low and you are watching the DVD with the AC/DC cord, the LCD pulls from the battery, that's why you have no picture, but sound. Try removing the battery and plugging it up to watch. This worked for me. I was ready to send my DVD back until I called. Hope this helps. Also, I agree that the DVD is good, but the sound could be better. And also, I agree, Toshiba needs to bundle a case with this DVD player."
2,Possible fix for black screen problem,"I have had this unit for 11 months and had the same problem that several other reviewers had - a blank screen but the DVD plays. I took it to the repair shop and found out that the 1 year warranty is only for parts and that it was going to cost $125 to fix. I emailed Toshiba and they asked me to check the ""select"" switch located under the battery. Sure enough, it was in the AV Out position and not the LCD and now it works fine. Hope this helps :)The player is OK - nice screen and good size and feel. The battery has a very short life (sometimes less than the length of the movie) and has to be removed from the unit when it is not being used or it will drain the battery. This is my first unit but I would think that there are better units out there."
5,"Crystal clear, poignantly honest, beautifully written","An incredibly simple, honest book about mother/daughter love, hope after death, childhood wonders and fears. Via is real - so real with Minot's clear pictures, I went back to grade school and childhood family life with her. Beautifully written, compelling, crystal clear and honest, it's an amazing first novel."
3,Beautiful Writing Except...,"for the ending. A much-loved child's memories of her mother in an almost perfect family. Heart-warming, touching, and all of that, but the ending was suddenly very unrealistic. Via's mom is dead, but she knows SHE'S going to be okay. Not too upset at all, ready for her next adventure in life as a newly motherless, self-sufficient child. My mother died when I was nine, and this wasn't my reaction at all. So not a very credible ending in my opinion."
1,hocus pocus,"You can prove or disprove anything with a little hocus pocus. After 200 years of using silver fillings(mercury) you think the FDA would not allow something if it was harmful--hummmm!!! Wonder how much money he made off this book?For all the people using these ""white"" fillings--composites--just to replace silver filling--I wonder what chemicals leak from these polymers? They haven't been in use as long as metal filings.I'm donating my book to the garbage can."
3,"Okay, but...","Having never purchased a knife case like this before, I have no concrete basis for my rating. However, in the few months I've owned the case, I can say that there just HAS to be a better way to carry your knives around. This one doesn't seem to hold them securely enough, as they occasionally ""rattle"" during transport (and, if you're not careful, they could fall out of the case). It's serviceable, but I expected more."
3,"Does the job, but not great","This case is pretty solid quality, the locks are a great feature. However, it doesn't always hold the knives securely. It is possible for them to slip out and fall right out of the case. This has actually happened a couple of times now, especially with my carving fork for some reason. I don't like that the ends aren't secured in some way to prevent this from happening.As long as you put the right tools into the right sized slots you shouldn't have too many problems with them slipping out. The pocket on the side is a handy addition as well."
3,Knife Case,"I really like this knife case. It is what I expected. It is durable and has lots of slots for knives. The only problem is that sometimes the knives slide out of the side, but it hasn't been a huge problem."
4,a good detective novel,"This is a well-written, entertaining, mysterious detective novel. The twist of course is that the mystery solver is a Jesuit, but how fun is that! A nice light read that surprises you with moments of insight into people."
3,Yurda,"I purchased this product because of the Henckels name, however,I am dissappointed. I put it the diswasher, when I took it outit was all rusty. I will send it back for Wurshof brand."
4,Sharp and Good Quality,These appear to be made very well and they're extremely sharp. The reason for a four star is because they're a bit uncomfortable...could be I just need to get used to new scissors
4,Good buy.,"Solid, well made, and sharp. If it only could be separated for cleaning.Buy one for your kitchen or workshop."
1,"Problems within 4 months: UPDATE (DEC 16, 2008):","Within four months the rivets had corroded in all of the knives but I decided to live with it. After 10 months one side of the handle separated from the rivets in one of the knives and it just fell apart. I am sending the whole set back to Henckels immediately.UPDATE:Henckels sent me a new set of knives just like the ones I had. I have had them more than 6 months and they have not corroded. If another one breaks, Henckels will replace it. Apparently I am unable to increase the number of stars so I'll just say here that I now give them 5 stars. These knives are great for steak. They are sharper than any steak knife I have ever used."
2,cheap looking,I couldn't keep these knives. They are cheap looking and lightweight in person. The blade seems very thin. There is no heft and nothing substantial to the knives. Disappointing.
5,Couldn't be more happy...especially with the price!,"I always wanted a glider for the nursery, but cringed at the thought of spending over $500 (which is easy to do on just the glider). My Nan bought this for our baby to be and boy do we LOVE it! The chair and ottoman really fit all our needs. It looks great, was easy to put together and has lasted very well with the year+ of use we have had with it so far. I sit and rock my baby for hours - when he'll sit still! I would definitely choose this chair all over again."
5,Fantastic Shades,"Living here in Arizona a quality window shade is as important as having a good snow shovel living in Michigan.Without a good window shade our Jeep steering wheel will go so hot it will actually burn your hands. People carry bathroom hand towels in their cars to drape over their steering wheels out here in the desert.I've used a couple pathetic local store sun shades and they just get limp, fall down, drape and sag.This one though.. AMAZING! It fits perfect, snug and the quality is 20x's better than what I can find at the local stores.This was well worth the money and well worth the money.Now I have to find one that fits my other car."
5,LUV IT,this is a good prodict it dose a good job lighting up my side walk it is easy to install it comes with a bulb and it is a good sterdy light and it has a good price
4,Just what I was looking for ...,"I wanted a case to store my sharp knives and keep them out of the hands of my little girl. This knife case is great. It does just what I wanted it to do. I can see why some may find it a little small, however. I have two separate knife collections: one for produce and one for meats. I purchased this case for my meat knives. It easily holds my cleaver, my two carving knives, my carving fork, my trimmer, and my poultry shears. I didn't need anything bigger, and the price on this item is great. Just make sure it has enough space for your collection before ordering."
2,Not Sturdy,"We purchased this walker for our son, who is now ten months old. The top console pivots: down for when the baby sits or up for when the baby stands. But in either location, the base is way too light. Before our baby was standing, we let him sit at the unit and use the console. But he grabbed the handle, and must have leaned back a little, and the whole unit came tumbling after him. No major injuries, but he was still frightened. Now that he's standing, whenever he tries to pull himself up on this, it seems to fall over. And unlocking the wheels seems to also cause him to fall every time. We only let him near this toy when we can actively prevent him from falling.The base on this unit really needs to be heavier to prevent falls: right now, this toy is not sturdy at all. We also purchased the Vtech learning activity table, which is very good and very sturdy. I would recommend that over this toy."
1,Scary sounds and unstable,"As everyone has already said, this toy is extremely unstable. My 10 month old son loves to pick toys up by the legs and since it is so top heavy it comes crashing down violently. Most annoyingly though is the sounds to the toy. First off, there is no volume control, and it is loud. Second, the ""cat"" and the ""monkey"" sound actually scared my child and made him cry. Third, it is just a hectic crazy console. You can't predict which ""game"" it is going to ask you to play and the piano keys don't play piano sounds. Babies like cause and effect, but this doesn't teach them anything because each button doesn't have a specific effect, it just sets off another series of loud annoying sounds. I expected more from Vtech, especially for an older baby. I am so disappointed. Luckily I can return it."
1,Worst toy ever !!,This toy was designed by some kind of idiot. As soon as my child goes to sit down the whole thing falls on top of him. My mom was watching him and said it fell on his neck. Some of the reviews said it is fine if you are supervising your child. I am always with my child watching him play and he continues to hurt himself on this toy. I am throwing it to the curb !
2,"Fun toy, but not a good walker","The Vtech Sit-to-Stand has engaged our son (who is now almost nine months) for many hours of fun. He likes to push the buttons to make noises and see flashing lights. The toy can be used without the base, which is a plus because that's where the trouble with this toy is.The locking switch is located on one of the front wheels and only seems to lock that one wheel. It also doesn't seem to hold that wheel very well -- I constantly have to relock it.The toy is also top-heavy. My boy has fallen a couple of times pulling it over on top of himself or having it scoot out from under him. It's an engaging toy but not one bigger kids can use as a walker without close supervision."
2,Not sturdy enough,"We recieved this as a hand me down when my son was 7 months and really into standing up, he is now 10 months old. It is not sturdy enough for him to pull up on, he always pulls it down on himself. Currently it is in a corner in the play room with the wheels locked. My son does like to stand and play and push the buttons. Sometimes he pulls on it and falls backward because even in the locked postion the wheels move a little. I have unlocked the wheels a couple times but my son pushes the toy and it seems to go faster than him and he falls on his face. Maybe it will be better when he is a little older."
5,Outstanding Book,Outstanding book. I myself am an author and this book is extremely well written. I recommend it highly. Great read.
4,"Provocative thesis, but a little long","Shifting provides an interesting take on the psycho-social demands on African American women, but the readers in my book club agree that it is too long and redundant-- the material of a magazine article extended to book length."
2,Not what I was hoping for,I was hoping for something that I could glue onto a cement wall that would hold a vine stem in place and encourage it to adhere to the wall. Years ago I remember things that cemented onto the wall with a wire loop that would bend over the stem to hold it. This came with a couple of yards of plastic tube and three small metal things to attach the plastic to and super glue. I managed to get one metal thing to attach to some wood (the super glue did not work on the cement) and tied the plastic at the other end making a straight line to hold the vines up. Doesn't really work that well for helping the vines adhere to the wall as they are not held that close.
5,Great Dot-to-Dot Book..especially for those interested in space exploration,"I recently bought this for my 4.5 year old and he absolutely loves it! At night, he stays up in bed (even though he's not supposed to) and works in this book. The pictures are great and I like the fact that there are several dot-to-dot puzzles in the same scene. Each dot-to-dot puzzle is color coded so that the user doesn't get confused between puzzles.I highly recommend this book to any child who is interested in space exploration and loves dot-to-dots."
3,Not as remembered-but still tastes good,"while the flavor is remains the same, i notice that the color of the crackers is different than when i first purchased these crackers from a local retailer back in 2006. Back the, the crackers had the same coloring as the image on the box. they now apprear to be more reddish in coloring. Also, there is a lot of breakage within the package. the shipping container and the cracker boxes themselves are in good shape, but more broken crackers than expected."
3,OK - not perfect,"I just got this stroller yesterday. It didn't take much time to put together. I am somewhat disappointed in it for a few reasons. first, it is heavy. Second, it is awkward when turning. I got it because the weight was up to 45 where the swivel front wheel one that I found was only up to 35 lbs. I do like the music on board but find the compartment for it is always getting in the way of the handlebar. I'm wondering if I would have been just as happy with a $99 stroller."
2,Dissapointed.,The book is really a manual; it is very short only took me two hours to read the entire book. It seems to be very repetative and it does not tell a story. I would not reccomend this book.
3,OK book,"Very simple to reed, and well quite basic for me! I have read better books from this author, but well it gives good life tips"
1,Regrettable pseudoscience,"In my opinion, Don Campbell has turned a subject that deserves serious study into a pop-culture, new-agey farce. It is unfortunate that the subject gained popular currency via this book. What should have been a serious subject for discussion and study has degenrated to the level of empty headed pop psychology."
4,Nice Sticks...price is okay.,"I got these sticks for my birthday...I've never had to use another pair since(been about 7 months now) Its a shame too, I kind of like breaking wooden sticks every month on a cymbal! The bounce is incredible, i can play alot longer and faster. Only complaint and its a small one: Just like everything Metallica, its overpriced. Oh well. I won't pay $90 for shows anymore either."
4,Fantastic fitting joint,"This is a great bit for the price. Produces a very good fitting joint. My one reservations is that I wish it had a 1/2"" shank for a little bit better stability.Rick"
2,Tear out King,Purchased these bits to make some shaker style doors in maple. Tear out occurred on the majority of rails no matter how much I adjusted speed of my router or my feed rate. Use great caution when cutting stiles with these as major kickback occurs. In addition cutting the stiles I found the stile to be thinner then the groove and thus did not achieve a tight joint. Very disappointed. Paying the extra $30 for the Freud two piece set for my next project.
4,It doesn't go ON the baby seat!!,"To the person who wrote the review about this being unsafe. This toy goes around the headrest of the BACK SEAT OF YOUR CAR, not on the infant carrier. DUH!I think this will be a great calm toy for my baby to look at while we're driving! I hope I recieve it. ( i registered for it)"
3,"Uneven, but worth it if your a diehard Chilton fan.","""1970"" is an uneven album, but it is worth the price if your a diehard Alex Chilton fan. The best songs on this one are very different - the sweet ballad ""EMI Song"", and the punk-meets-Led Zepplin cover of the Archie's ""Sugar Sugar"". ""EMI Song"" is possibly a distant cousin to Big Star's ""Another Chance"" while ""Sugar Sugar"" might be seen as kind of a cousin to ""Baron of Love"" from Alex's ""Flies On Sherbert"" album. Since this album was actually recorded between Alex's time with the Box Tops and his time with Big Star, he is actually still singing in his Box Tops raspy voice on much of this material though not all of it. This is also the first time that he was allowed to write most of his own material for an album so what you see is an artist in transition. ""EMI Song"" and ""Sugar Sugar"" make it all worthwhile though."
2,Olive Drab no Cross,"Great bag....not the one I believed I was ordering. There was only one color option which was the 'olive drab no cross' yet it is not drab...more of just a dark olive. Holds up all of my college books great, however the color is completely different from the picture. Not as cool."
1,"Looks great, not so durable.","Very disappointing.While I loved the style of this bag it didn't last over a month carrying my computer and maybe on textbook. While I have had bags slowly breakdown and have come to expect that from less expensive bags, this bag simply tore where the strap attaches with no real way to mend it."
1,Not What I Ordered,I ordered this bag pictured above but what I received was some knockoff and not the bag I ordered. The bag I received has velcro on the flap and not clips. I emailed the company but to no avail they have not responded.Stay Away!
1,"Greasy, sugary and squishy","Ok, I really wanted to like these but couldn't get past the texture, look and smell. They're very dark and squishy, have an off smell nothing like strawberries, and the sugar and oil was a definite turn-off for me. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get myself to eat even one of them. Freeze-dried strawberries are definitely the way to go for me!"
2,too much sugar,"Although the product was enjoyed by my husband and children, I will not buy them again. I was looking for all natural--no sugar added...just dried fruit. I was shocked at the sugar content. I thought they were also a bit pricey."
3,Interesting music but Christian influence is very strong and obvious in this DVD,"The music is wonderful. It sounds like a story is being told. Sometimes, it sounds like footsteps of people walking. Christian influence is very strong and obvious in this DVD. A choir sings in every piece of music. I'm sure Christian people will enjoy this DVD than non-Christian."
3,3 stars,"Review on J.A. Henckels International Classic 6=inch stainless=steel Utility knife:Well, I cannot comment on this particular knife, for I sent it as a gift and have never used the product. I had heard it was a very useful item, and that is why I decided to purchase it as a gift."
2,Author is an elitist snob of a statistician,"This book is not accessible, not useful and is a waste of money. The book is about 150 pages of statistical babble that has no meaning or relevance to anyone outside of statistics. Understanding regression assumptions is important component of being able to use a statistical software package for data analysis using regression in any meaningful way. Unfortunately this book is written very high-level and does not provide any accessible way to understand the nuances of regression assumptions. Perhaps the author could have spent a few more pages explaining himself and his elaborate functions?"
3,Good but buy the forged blades instead,"Although Henkels is night and day better than most stamped blades, you are better off to pay the extra and get a set of forged blades (like the Henkels four star).Stamped blades don't last as long, they don't keep an edge nearly as well and they don't have the weight that comes from a good quality forged blade.If you are unsure of the difference, buy a 8"" forged chef's knife and see how much better it works."
1,Damages knife edge,"I have had one of these about 5-6 years. In the last year it took ""bites"" out of two good knive blades. Beware. Evidently not all are bad - see reviews - but obviously some are. Why risk it. Try a Furi sold here."
2,"good batteries, so-so charger","I got this set after reading some good reviews on the batteries and charger back in 2006. Since then, each set of 4 batteries were used together on Canon EX580 flash, charged together, and drained together.The other day, I picked up the BC9000 and put some ""fully charged"" powerex batteries, just off the MH charger, in to test. The BC9000 was able to put an extra 11-12% (~300mAh) into the batteries! Also, at least 1 of 4 batteries were at least 1% off in terms of mAh... Next, I'll be running some reconditioning tests to see...Bottom line - You are better off buying the BC-9000 for cheaper and buy 4 additional rechargeable AAs for comparable price, and you'll end up with 4 AAAs and some adapters on the side =)"
2,"Good for AA, very bad for AAA","Frankly, I would check out another brand. This one is expensive, and frustrating if you use AAA batteries. AAA batteries pop out of the charger every time I use it. Sometimes it pops out immediately or almost immediately. Other times I feel victorious in getting all the batteries to stay in the charger, only to later find a couple of them have popped out. I get around it by doing the obvious: I simply put all four batteries in, and charge only two (after two have popped out). Then I repeat the process. So after trying 4 twice, of the 8, I get 5 actually charged, which is all I need."
2,Readings Review,This book was not what I expected. It is too technical to use as a reference guide if your in college. The title of the book is very misleading. It should be titled research and data.
2,Barely works...,"These did help ""a little"" but not very much. I still feel the weight pulling down and can see the earlobe stretched with these patches on. The photo is VERY deceiving. It does not help even NEARLY as close as the photo shows."
3,Only Okay,"These are not as good as I expected from the reviews. On the plus side they hold up well, and I can get three days of wear out of them. For moderately heavy earrings they do take some of the weight off the piercing and the lobe, making them more comfortable. I have a pair of Heidi Klum earrings that I can only wear for six hours, even with this product, and they do start dragging after awhile. While they work well for any type of earring with a post, they don't do anything if you are trying to wear a heavy hoop. These are not miracle workers, but they are a pretty good product if you don't want to wear hoops. I still prefer the plastic discs that Avon used to sell some years back. Those were ideal."
5,Revolutionary Product!,"I'm a large, heavy earring fan, but unfortunately they don't love me. Over the years my lobes have become thin and stretched. What a shame since Betsey Johnson comes out this year with all these gorgeous (but heavy), pierced earrings. I still bought a few pair, but they looked quite ridiculous (even dangerous), on my worn-out lobes. Well, thankfully I found Lobe Wonder! My lobes look as if they are freshly pierced, even when wearing my biggest Betsey Johnson's. Simply unbelievable! Thanks so much for this great product, I'm sold for life."
5,Lobe Wonder works wonders,"I have used this product for several years and cannot do without them now. The holes in my ears had gotten rather large and I was afraid to wear pierced earrings. But the Lobe Wonders allow me to wear them without increasing the openings -- indeed, the openings have closed a bit. I will always use this product with pierced earrings."
2,Bait and switch by Amazon,"Last week, when I ordered this, it had the black cover mentioned below by others and the product description ""The Office - The Complete Series and Specials"". That is what my packing slip says as well. As others have said, you actually receive the season one and two products shrink-wrapped together, no specials. This is very poor form on Amazon's part; I intend to camp out on customer service until I get an answer for this."
5,Nice and Sharp!,"These knives are terrific. Very sharp, very elegant, nice smooth and comfortable handle. They look great and wash up easily. I plan to buy another set of 4 and the block to hold all 8."
5,Essential Ernest Holmes,"We have been students of Religious Science for over 10 years and read much of Ernest Holmes' work. This book is fantastic. It is easy to read and humorous as well as insightful and helpful. I recommend it to anyone interested in Religous Science, New Thought, positive thinking, or changing your life."
3,J.Henckel Enthusiast,"Do I really need to give you reasons why you should buy J.Henckels knifes? The name says it all! Quality at an affordable price and a lifetime of joy, not to mention a great investment. This meat cleaver lives up to the J.Henckel reputation and I have found it to be extremely helpful in the kitchen. The cleaver is very well balanced and cuts with smooth and effortless precision. My mom keeps telling me to stop buying all these knifes and instead wait for my wedding day and register for a complete set. Well, at these prices I can't wait and I sure do not want to end up with anything less than J. Henckels. As for the wedding day, I told her not to hold her breath! My J. Henckels knifes are mine!"
5,J.A. Henckels Twin High Carbon Stainless-Steel Meat Cleaver,"Knife is excellent quality, good weight and is a great addition to our Chef knife and Santoku."
4,Meat Cleaver,Very good product. My wife and I have both used it and it does everything we want it to!
1,NOT AUTHENTIC BLACK SOAP!,Boy was I duped! Here I am thinking I was going to get 3oz of AUTHENTIC black soap for $1.99..silly me! This is nothing but regular bar soap (think no-name and unscented)dyed black! The dye even rubs off on the washcloth! Do not buy if you want the real deal!
4,Trimo-san,"I do not use it, I order it for my mother. She has no comments about the product.I will say tha The shipping process was very slow. I don't remember the exact time but it seem to be too long. The price was OK but next time I will go to Walgreens, CVS or Walmart.Thank youAnthony"
2,Trimo-San Order,I did not order Trimo-San Jelly. I returned the product unopened. I hope you received the product. and the charges were removed from my account.
5,Awesome DVD,"Great DVD! Like all other Hillsong DVD's this is a Spirit filled praise and worship DVD. The sound and lyrics are good. I especially like ""It's Your Love"" on this DVD. Darlene Zscech performs this song very well and leads the praise and worship well. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, including non-Christians. My prayer is that you will come to know Jesus Christ our Saviour. Thank you Hillsong. God bless you!"
5,"Hours of Pleasure and Clean Teeth, Too!","My miniature schnauzers love these treats! My veterinarian recommended them and she tells me they virtually eliminate the need for professional dental cleaning. If the beautiful white color of their teeth is any indication, she's right! Amazon makes this great product available at half the price found in retail pet stores."
1,Very poor tolerance,"I purchase this saw to cut an 11/16 hole. I measured the saw with a caliper and it is certainly a full 11/16 inches but it does not center around the arbor. Not even close. Seems like the blade just isn't square in the base. Though I didn't try, because I wanted to return this piece of crap, I'm quite certain it would have cut a hole at least 3/4. I could have purchase a better 3/4 saw locally if that's what I wanted. If you are going to market tolerances down to 1/16 of an inch you really should make sure the saw centers on the arbor."
3,Pretty decent,"For the ridiculously low price of approximately $75 dollars you get a pretty good unit. It doesn't have the range of the top end guys like Escort or Valentine. When the Ka radar light comes on, SLOW DOWN!!!. You're probably just about line of sight with the boys in blue (gray, khaki, whatever...). It's POP signal is actually more reliable than my wife's $400 Escort. I think the POP on the Escort is actually more of a snooze button. The PRO-58 paid for itself on the first missed ticket. For a guy who thinks speed limits are really just suggestions (no officer or judge has ever bought that line of reasoning mind you), what more can you ask for ?"
1,Don't waste your money,This thing is horrible. Picks up every automatic door and alarm system. Also turns off and resets on it's own. When it did work it was only when I was riget on top of the radar. If you want a good one spend more and get a better one
5,ole lady in CO,"I had an Amazon.com gift card so actually bought this for my daugher, butsadly, noted...'made in china' of the 2 purchases only one was made in USA.Guess that can be noted on line..."
3,Disappointed as well.....,"Doesn't have the weight or feel of other forged Henckels products. I noticed light staining on the metal after the first wash....reminiscent of lower quality knives even though Henckles' claims that it's stainless and not subject to corrosion. Additionally, the metal seems softer. After just a few weeks of normal use, the blade already shows abnormal wear. In my opinion, your money is better spent on higher end Henckles german steel or Wustof."
5,Excellent buy,What an awesome book. Covers so much. It was a gift butI had to look at it first. Good pictues and details.
3,Not practical for every household,"The recipes sound good; however, ingredients required are not practical for every household. If you have easy access to ingredients NOT usually carried in traditional grocery stores; then this could be a practical recipe book. However, if you live 30 plus miles from organic vegetables and ingredients such a sucanat; then this book is NOT practical. I like Marilu Henner and believe she has easy access to the type ingredients required to create her recipes. I believe she has the funds too! Unfortunately, not everyone lives in sunny California with access to a fat pocket book and organic ingredients in abundance! Bottom line, recipes are not practical for the average American household."
3,Good but still lacking ...,Where as the concept is great and we are recently milk free not totally dairy free it is not easy or always practical. There are great motivators and stories here some nice glossy food photos.Seems short on the practical level and also quite costly recipes. I also feel that most GREAT cook books need to have photos with most recipes. A cook book needs visuals and this title was very short here. Those that were included were great just not many.A great concept but should have could have been executed better!
2,Not worth buying,I have her first 2 books and I think they are great. This one was not what I was hoping for. Many of the recipes simply taste terrible and the amounts etc. are inaccurate. I also noticed that she cut and pasted many of the recipes and only changed one ingredient. I expected more from her and would think twice before buying another one of her books.
1,Ripped off...don't trust,"First off they sent me a defective item that they didn't want to exchange and then when they finally did accept it, they said it never was returned even though it was and I have the receipt to prove it. i highly recommend not buying anything from this company as they sell defective items and refuse to refund or exchange items. Very poor business ethics."
4,Good points but has errors,"This book, which is essentially the same as the Secrets for Step 2 book, has excellent topics and points. However, it has numerous errors (especially in the Vascular Surgery, Psychiatry, and OB/Gyn chapters) and has not been updated to meet today's guidlines. Use this book to get an idea about what you need to study. Then, go use the Blueprints series to get the correct information."
5,GOT WISECRACKERS?,"I was pleased to find Wisecrackers on Amazon, since my grocery store stopped carrying them. Amazon is priced about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery; and they arrived in perfect condition)! Gotta love shopping online!!!The Rosemary/Garlic crackers are perfect with rich cheeses, and a glass of wine, especially if you like herb flavors.Partners Wisecrackers Low Fat Crackers, Roasted Garlic Rosemary, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)"
1,Better off trying to pass an uninflated 260q off as a worm.,"The only reason this book doesn't get a ZERO is that you have to give at least 1 star. Aaron's first book (Balloon Animals) was worth picking up but this one is a total disappointment. (Even at $2.00) Almost all of the figures in this book would not even be recognizable without the animal's name as the title of the section you are reading. Please PLEASE don't waste your time. Go to the Qualatex website and get ""260Q Figures"", and ""Advanced 260Q figures"". Just look under the ""Balloon Magic"" section. If you are a beginner, or thinking about just getting started, I would suggest getting the ""Balloon Fun"" creative activity book. ISBN 0-7853-1140-8. This will give you a VERY good foundation for doing twisting. Very nice animals, a nice flower, a couple of hats, and a couple of other very nice items."
4,Somewhat Skimpy but a Must for Seth Fans,"Let's face it. Any book by Jane Roberts that was published posthumously is bound to disappoint. This one is a little skimpy compared to other Seth Books. Not quite as good, say, as ""The God of Jane"" or ""The Nature of Personal Reality."" But nevertheless any Seth book is a welcome addition to my personal library. But it's definitely a book for die-hard fans. Beginners might enjoy ""Psychic Politics"" more, or one of the other earlier works."
1,Waste of money,"After reading the 3 positive reviews, I gave this product a try to unclog my drain. The product says it unclogs up to 8 drains (one per pump), but after 3 pumps it stopped working and my drain was still clogged. If you have a clogged drain, don't waste your money on this product."
3,Please stop calling this a sharpener.,"Product description is inaccurate, a steel honer does not make your knife sharper, it is used to bring the damaged parts of the blade back into alignment. It does not sharpen, and if used excessively and incorrectly actually does the opposite."
5,It does what it's supposed to do,What else is there to ask for? I use a steel for finishing and to help hone and maintain my knives. Nothing fancy here. It does what it's supposed to do.
5,It's a parable for a practical email management course which really works,"If email is demanding more and more of your business time, it's time to take in THE HAMSTER REVOLUTION, which tells of an HR director who meets an efficiency coach and learns a simple management system. It's a parable for a practical email management course which really works, includes a case study showing how over 2,000 Capital One associates cut their email time by 23 percent, and tells how to add quality into email management strategy for optimum results. Busy managers in particular will relish its advice, making THE HAMSTER REVOLUTION especially recommended for business libraries.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Foxhunting at its Best,"What a fun story to read. I remember how exciting it was to be out foxhunting. I had almost forgotten the thrill and joy of early morning meets. I haven't hunted since the 1980s, but the meets, the tail gates, the hunt parties and Hunt Balls are all brought back to me through the author's text. Thank you for a few hours of memories. The story was just right, the plot was well done, the action was smooth and steady, and the best part, it had a happy ending. I remember attending a Hunt Ball in the Middleburg Community Center, I was happy to see the committee stills uses the green and white theme. I think they used racing silks that year in addition to the green covered tables. A fine novel. Thank you. An Old Whipper-In from Warrenton Hunt."
5,Sensational!!,"Couldn't put the book down! It held me captive from beginning to end. The town of Middleburg, VA. came alive and I felt familiar with the characters and surroundings. The plot was full of twists and turns and had me up and down until the explosive ending when all was revealed."
3,Henckels Nickel Poultry Shears Review,"Great for doing what they were intended to do, cut poultry & most anything else you place in between the blades. However, OIL THESE SUCKERS! They are nickel plated but demand you keep them oiled IMMEDIATELY after washing them. They will spot on you ASAP if you give them the chance to. Super great shears if you don't mind the TLC they require."
2,Not much as I thought,"Most of the advice is silly and can't expect it to work on everyone. Before I bought it, I thought it was more creative than it actually is."
3,"It's next to impossible to find flavored decaf in Portland, OR","In Atlanta, where I previously lived, at least one large farmer's market made its own flavored coffee, in a multitude of flavors. Alas, not so here in Portland. This coffee is okay, but not great. The flavoring in a little to subtle for my taste. Acceptable, but..."
4,Carving Knife set does the job well,"I gave it 4 stars since I have not tried a more expensive carving knife set. I used it twice over the holidays, carving a 14lb Thanksgiving turkey and a 8 lb leg of lamb for Christmas.The knife and fork did not feel heavy in my hands while carving both on the kitchen counter and cutting was a breeze.My only possible complaint is the corners of the handle feel a bit sharp. It won't cut your hands, but might be a little uncomfortable for some."
4,Punny Book,"Elvis the Rooster Almost Goes to Heaven is a very funny book. Not sure if kids will get all the puns/jokes, but, as an adult, if you have to read a book over and over, this one would be a good choice. I purchased this book to include in my elementary school's library collection."
4,"Stens 280339 Idler pulley for Craftsman 30"" Mower","This metal idler pully replaces the plastic/metal one originally supplied on a Sears 30"" Craftsman mower (502.254172), circa 1980s. OEM pulley part #91178, item marked ""v3000-3316 Capital"". Approx dimensions 3"" outside diameter, about 2"" inside diamter at v-groove, 1/2"" dia. bearing hole, and about 5/16"" wide v-groove.Apparently Murray made the mower deck parts for this model for Craftsman, including the belt, OEM part 37x57, which can be replaced with Murray #37x57.The original plastic idler pulley disintegrated in half and shredded the blade drive belt. The Stens 280339 replacement is entirely metal, and fits the existing pulley location perfectly. I've had no issues with the new part. Just be sure to note the arrangement of the existing bolt, nut, and spacer before removing your old pulley so you can install the new one correctly."
3,Good but not for my Betta,"I think this would be a fine filter for a small tank but the flow output was not directionally adjustable right or left, only flowed straight out. I need a filter that can be turned towards the wall to help buffer the output. My betta was sort of blowing all over and hid out. The nozzle can only be moderatly adjusted to flow upwards or downwards, and this is a stretch. Other than than the motor was quiet and powerful. I ended up with the Penn-Plex Cascade 170 (which says 10 gallons or less but I used both in my 3 gallon tank and Elite seemed a stronger flow). My betta completely ignores the Cascade one with the nozzle turned to the back wall. Sorry Hagen. I also cut the top quarter off the sponge and added a section of charcoal pad to add chemical filtration on the Cascade so I think that would work for the Hagen Elite too. Good luck!Penn Plax Cascade 170 Internal Filter for Aquariums"
4,Missing parts,I like the filter. works great. had to make my own air tube to fit on the filter because the one that was to be included was missing.
1,too powerful,"i got this thing to use in my 4gal biorb. it fits fine but it sucks the fish around due to the strong current it creates.i put a sponge on the end but it didn't help--edit---after looking at a user submitted photo i saw a sponge on the end of the intake, with the tube removed.i did that myself and put rocks in front of the unit. it doesn't seem to be bothering the fish now, but i'm not so sureits effective as i have it now."
1,HORRIBLE,"This filter is horrible. It is noisy, and has to strong of a current for a small fish and a small tank. It is not worth your money to buy this filter. Go look at another one NOW!"
3,Short and Sweet,"While the editorial reviews suggest this does not offer anything new, and that may very well be the case if you are familiar with all of the materials available on Lewis, it seems to me that this book was a short and sweet review of the essential elements of information on Lewis' works. A summary of such works as ""The Allegory of Love"" in four pages can help someone even after having read Allegory. This applies to other writings as well. In that respect, this may not offer much that is new, but it offers a very handy review of what Lewis was about in a way that reduces the work it would normally take to find this out."
5,Great knife,This knife is razor sharp and the perfect size for chopping onions and other coarse vegetables. I was able to easily cut through a butternut squash. I've never done that with any of my old knives without first softening the squash in the microwave. I bought it as a gift for my daughter. Now I wish I had one for myself!
4,Damn fine first real chef knife,"Considering it's $50, this is a steal. It's not the best in the world but I'd have paid $75 for it. I've recommended it many times already."
5,"Travel Advisory: How to Avoid Thefts, Cons, and Street Scams","This book is worth your entire vacation expense. It can save you thousands of dollars both in grief and lost time when faced with someone taking all your money, ID, credit and phone cards. It certainly pays to be aware and safe in unknown places. I felt much safer knowing that with the tips in this book, I not only had protected my valubles, but was aware of my surroundings and it helped me avoid all the pitfalls that novice tourists make. Five star"
2,Morris is unworthy of her subject.,"This book is a shame; Mrs. Luce deserves and, elsewhere, has received far more serious treatment. The work does, however, say a great deal about the exceptionally small Ms. Morris."
1,Poor Quality,"I was pretty disappointed of the quality of the brush. I couldn't even make a thin, even straight line. The brush is rough. I should have known better because it was too cheap. YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET!"
5,I love it.,"I am a Chinese. The meat cleaver is my chef's knife. I'm using it everyday, cutting from scallion to pork. I even use it peeling the skins of ginger or potato. It's very comfortable using this knife. I highly recommend it."
4,oops I think I cut off my pinkie!,"This is a very heavy duty knife. It's got a good weight to it. You could cut off a finger and not even know, that is until the excruciating pain reaches your brain."
5,GREAT HORSE BALL! Same as Parelli's,This ball is the exact same ball that Pat Parelli uses to play with his horses at a cheaper price. So if any of you are PNH students this is a perfect deal. It's the same Bigens Ball that you can get from the Parelli website (for $35 plus shipping.)
4,huge,We weren't able to put up all 3 on the same wall.but managed to put the last one on the inside of a cabinet door.I really didn't know we had so many herbs and spices.We cleared out an entire cabinet.with very little room to spare.These spice racks are huge.If someone only had 10 containers.I'd suggest something much smaller.if you want to clear cabinets or racks this is your best bet.
2,"Functional, but not durable","The charger worked just fine for a couple of months, but the housing of the charger plug--the mini-usb end, not the 12v plug end--separated. The halves came apart, opening a contact in the mini-usb plug and rendering the charger useless. I coaxed a few days continued service out of it by securing the plug assembly with a tiny zip-tie pulled tightly around it, but even that wasn't sufficient to keep the connection reliably in place, and I retired the charger.Perhaps if you need this for a semi-permanent installation where the charger will rarely be handled or moved, you might get long-term service from it. But if you'll be moving this around frequently as I did (used it to power a portable GPS unit in my truck), you'll need something more durable."
4,Nice introduction to kite flying,"As a child I used to build kites from scratch using newspaper, glue, whittled tree branches and string. Doing that taught me alot about kites.I really didn't want to go to all that trouble when my children started asking about kites, so I bought this one.They love it. So do I. It takes about 5 minute to setup (that's including taking it out of the package). It is so simple and so durable. It comes with everything you need: the kite, tail, and about 150 feet of string (might be more or less than that). This kite is nice enough to fly at 500 feet, so go ahead and add a longer string; it can handle it. It even has nice packaging so you can store it for next kite season.If you want a nice introduction to kite flying and something fun to do with the children you can't go wrong here."
5,Fun and Educational,"My third grade son really enjoyed this book. It's a lovely story, with easy to follow paragraphs that keep the student engaged.The author has unit studies for this and all of her books on her website. Homeschoolers and others looking to get more out of the books their children read will love it!"
5,My five year old LOVED it!,"The concepts of fractions are presented and illustrated so joyfully that my kindergarten-age child couldn't wait to read it a second time.She learned all the concepts in the book effortlessly. Where were books like these when we were growing up?My eleven-year old got a big kick out of the illustrations, too. Very engaging and entertaining. I plan to order more of Loreen Leedy's books."
2,Automatic Man,"Great line-up, great album. A very unique blend of progressive and spacey rock. Catchy guitar riffs on the part of Pat Thrall. If I were rating the album I would give it 5 stars.However, I'm rating the release and sound quality of this CD, which is very disappointing. NO MASTER TAPES used here folks! Another long anticpated release met with nice packaging but album-type sound quality transfered onto CD. Seems to be a growing trend these days. Unacceptable by any means, unless you know upfront what you're getting.My advice is if you already own a copy of this LP and it's in VG condition, save your money and listen to your vinyl. The CD is actually a downgrade in quality compared to my Automatic Man LP."
1,Puzzled,"I bought this for my 12 year old who so far hasn't been able to get it to play. (I haven't either) Before giving up on it, we have to retrievethe directions from his grandmother's house and read them thoroughly. I'mdisapointed since Coby's have a good reputation."
4,cd Player,This unit is working well. I traveled 2000 miles and listened to Audio tapes all the time. Good Buy.
1,Not a chefs knife,"This knife is a nice little multi-purpose knife. Like others have said it loses its edge fast, but is soft steel that sharpens quickly. This knife, however, is not useful for chopping or mincing. The bolster is too small and after chopping a few items you'll find that you have bloody knuckles, not very appetizing while preparing food. I bought this knife for camping but I don't find it as useful as a proper chefs knife."
4,Excellent knife,This knife has a thin blade that keeps its edge well. Very useful for an every day kitchen knife.
3,fine knife,"This is certainly the cheaper version. I thought I was getting a knife like my roommates, but it is clearly a cheaper version. The blade goes straight into the handle without any kind of ""guard."" The spot where the blade meets the handle is a little sharp, but unless you are an idiot you won't cut yourself.It isn't as nice as this one (which has the finger guard thingy) but it is much cheaper. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21E2M0NMESL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"
3,Busted's first attempt.,"I think this is just a ""good"" pop song, nothing groundbreaking really, they could have released another song as their first single since I think this is too childish for America. I hope their album is a mixture of their both albums cause now that they're older they just seem silly lusting about their high school teacher. I hope thier next single will be either ""3am"" or ""Who's David?"", and if they want another uptempo they shoudl go for ""Crashed the wedding"" or ""Thuderbirds are go"".*An important detail, the cd specifies that the CD-Rom track is 14.39 which I think it's a mistake or maybe it's just my cd, it just has the video which is like 3.20 long and another clip which is a waste of space. It's just them singing accapella on the streets and being chased by a cop, they do t 3 times and it gets really annoying. It also has a gallery with about 6 pictures. All of this hardly sum 6 mins in total running time."
1,What the hell was that?,"When I first saw this item the memories of the glory days of Ren & Stempy washed over me, however this is nothing like the good ol' days. The whole thing is nothing but sex and fart jokes. Now I like fart jokes but not when they are 15 minutes long. Horrably annoying cartoon women bouncing around for half the cartoon is not my idea of funny. Of course, is not sexy, it's just creepy. Lastly, half of these cartoons seem to be nothing more than inside jokes and stories from the cartoonists. Only amusing if you are really into the behind the scenes scene, completely bored and confusing to the rest. Ren & Stempy's quality died after Nick canned the show way back when and it's only gotten worst."
5,a Supplemental review,"I agree that this collection is nothing like the charming Nick episodes. On the bright side, it is creator-driven. This is what John wanted to do all along. In accordance to some of the other reviews, there ARE flurries of gratuitous acts in this collection that may not apply to one's tastes; however, the animation quality is still as good as ever. So, whether the content is good or not, the animation is still to look forward to. With this DVD, you can't lose."
4,Very Funny Cartoons,"These cartoons are very funny and they don't hold anything back. If you liked Ren and Stimpy for nickelodean, then you will certainly enjoy these cartoons. Good Job John K!!"
3,Not as good as the Nick run.,"I must say these are a bit funny but not that good. I must say this might be an adult show but I see some kid humor (Fire Dogs 2 Part 2). I just don't see how the great stuff they did with nick, what you may see here is just plain adult [...] (Mainly Naked Beach Frenzy and Stimpy's Pregnant witch both have nudity). Now only perverts will like these. Whene I get older I will buy this but (Hopefully) will not be amused with Naked Beach Frenzy and Stimpy's Pregnant. So if you wan't the shows best part of the run, Get season's 1&2 and I am a big fan of 3&4."
2,Limp,"The animation extremes are every bit as inspired as the original Nick shorts (sometimes even moreso), but the scripts are terrible, the ""high concept"" of Ren and Stimpy being explicitly homosexual (or something like that) is lame, and John K.'s presentations/interviews are overly defensive, unpleasantly seedy, and almost entirely pointless. ""Naked Beach Frenzy"" is the only inspired short (Shampoo Master is a howl). John K. is an heir to Bob Clampett in style, but not, ultimately, in sensibility. Also, contrary to the credits posted here, Billy West actually had the foresight to decline reviving Stimpy, with good reason."
5,REN AND STIMPY REMIX,I recieved the item on time and in wonderful condition. It not your average cartoon don't give it to the kids.
4,"At times repulsive,but...","Nina is the amateur detective spoiled brat protagonist. She's a poverty lawlawyer, but she doesn't care about her impoverished clients...her colleague/boyfrienddoes give a hang, but at novel's end, when she does finally getting interested in her clients, she blames his sincerity for her previous jadedness...Nina cares about her looks and her I.Q. She's selfish and obnoxious.--Why haven't I said anything about the mystery, you ask? What mystery? There are crimes, and for no particular reason besides mystery novel format's sake, culprits are found. The suspense did not kill me.To the book's credit, there is snappy writing, and I think the author well portrayed(either gutsily or unintentionally) the worst of herself, as Nina Fischman, and maybe Nina is changing towards the end."
5,Spanish Verb Workbook,"This is a book I have been looking for for years. It is helping in tutoring a student who is very conscientious to fill out several pages a day, and enjoying it. She finds it informative, interesting, and quite thorough. Verbs are usually difficult to grasp, but this book gives the explanations and practice exercises that the student needs to learn Spanish."
4,"good, simple and cheap","This is a very simple KVM. Lacking the fancy bells and whistles of the more expensive untis, this one does it's basic tasks."
2,There are better 2D fighters games out there,"I give Jojo's Bizarre Adventure a thumbs up for originality (some very colorful characters and special attacks here), but I think the game is otherwise mediocre. The graphics and animation are below average (compared to games like Marvel vs Capcom and Street Fighter Alpha), and the game itself is not much fun to play. If you want a good 2D fighting game for your Dreamcast, get one of the Marvel vs Capcom or Street Fighter titles. The only people bound to enjoy Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are 2D fighting freaks. Others will probably regret their purchase."
1,Not a Good Book!,"Porter never talked to anybody involved with the band, and serves us nothing but a mix/match cut 'n paste job. Which in itself wouldn't be such a bad thing, if it weren't for the numerous factual errors in here. Porter really doesn't have much of a clue. I even flung the book into the corner when, at one point, he claims that the Ramones opened every show over the years with 'Blitzkrieg Bop', even if he never did see 'm in action himself, a quick glance at the four official live albums would have given proof to the contrary. Heck, the guy has previously written books on Nu-Metal and the Darkness, which just about sez it all..."
2,Cracked after two uses,It is a beautiful dish but did not last. I am Very disappointed. I used this dish twice and now it has a crack half way across the bottom of the dish. I own other Portmeirion dishes and never had this problem. Maybe mine was just a lemon.
5,Perfect for apple crisp!,This dish is deeper than most pie dishes and has nearly vertical sides. These features make it the ideal shape for any kind of fruit dessert that is made without a bottom crust. Mine has proven to be very durable without any special care.
3,Keep in mind...,"This is bascally a bug detector or a magnectic field detector. It is not goign to tell you if your Dryer is going to kill you, and it does NOT detect the type of radiation that you would get from a dirty bomb or a nuke."
1,Didn't detect anything,I am not an expert on these things - but this detector didn't seem very sensitive. In my whole house nothing has a detectable EMF radiation level. I'm either really lucky or it isn't very accurate/sensitive. I also have a power line in my yard with a trunk station (looks like a metal trash can mounted on a telephone pole). These are not supposed to be very good to be near - but the Osun detector did detect it from about five yards away and gave it a yellow light. From other literature I've read this leads me to believe that the detector isn't picking up smaller amounts of EMF. Probably better to invest in something non-ipsative anyway.
2,Pick a different accessory,"We love the Haba ball track, but this accessory doesn't work all that well - it's VERY hard to get the marbles to go through the mill. It comes with some good pieces, but there are much better options for the Haba track."
5,US Battleships An illustrated design history. Norman Freidman,"An excellent book to the normal highstands of this author. It complements the other books on US Carriers, US Cruisers and US Destroyers. Well illustrated and packed with facts."
2,Promised Sharing Software Not Supplied,"Linksys advertises that the internet connection software included is Sygate (which has gotten good reviews.) My kit, just purchased, came with LanBridge on a CD with file dates of 10/99. The documentation is pre-Windows 98. It really only covers dial-up connections using Windows 95 and earlier. The supplier of LanBridge (which Linksys emphatically states THEY do not support) apparently was Virtual Motion. They are long gone and so is the support. Lanbridge, after hours of tweaking can be made to operate, but inconsistently. Linksys phone support seems to be non technical folks reading scripts that may not have anything to do with the problem. Consider avoiding this product if LanBridge is included."
2,Pretty bad...,"I tried out this kvm switch and didn't like it much at all. First off my computers think I'm using a different mouse with it (linux didn't like it at all). Second the mouse lagged a bit. Getting to worse things, the control key is really lagged with this switch, not good for games that use the control key. If you press the control key repeatedly then you get switched to the other computer. Finally, the worst thing is, don't expect to play any high throughput graphics games on this thing. I tried playing quake3 on it and it looked like utter crap, made my geforce 2 card look like a voodoo1 (or perhaps worse). Other than that, it was ok for basic stuff, just not for me."
3,"Very good product, if just it reliable....","Got this for one month. Has Win2k server & Linux connected. Suddenly the mouse started to shaking for the linux box. After switching the cable, find out that one of the KVM cable has the problem."
2,Did not work with Scrolling Mouse,"I have problems using the Microsoft Optical Mouse with this KVM switch because it does not recognize the scrolling mouse. Using the switch, I was also unable to use the middle button (as a ""Back"" function for the IE browser) and the thumb button (as a ""Forward"" function). Furthermore, as I use the switch for a desktop and my Thinkpad, I was also advised by the KVM switch manual that sometimes there might be a conflict between the switch and a certain Thinkpad functions. To circumvent that, I was told to break off a specific pin off the connection.... not exactly my ideal scenario when I first purchased this kit. Incidentally, I have switched over to a basic mechanical KVM switch and all of the above functions work properly on that KVM switch box."
5,a million uses,"My grandchildren use this and use this and use this. Of course, they do not use it as the box shows. It has become a village inside of a train track, it became the under structure for other block building and it became the tools for another board game. I actually used it as center pieces for a women's club Christmas party! BTW, the smaller green trees are used in a doll house as my granddaughter thinks they are great ""little lamps."" For some reason, all positive, the kids think that the people and the animals are very funny and therefore, good to play with!"
1,"Good picture, bad lamp life",The picture is very good for the price. I got this a little over a year ago for about $1200. (It can be found for much cheaper than that now)Just over the one year warranty the lamp on the unit went out. Now I have a tv that has no picture until I cough up the $250 price for a new lamp.I don't know if I am going to want to have to pay $250 every year to watch t.v. on it. This seems to be a very common complaint with Toshiba rear projection tv's.
2,disappointing,"the corners do not stay nice and flat against the seat, as shown in the photo. My seat protector droops and folds down at the top corners, leaving the seat exposed...which is where my toddler plants her feet. The pocket also sags open, which pulls the seat protector forward so that it bows out. I may have to rig it somehow - maybe add some straps and secure the seat protector around the seat so that it doesn't droop and sag so badly."
2,good but rips easily,"These are pretty decent seat protectors but my child has long legs and tend to rub his feet alot on the plastic and eventually the pocket ripped right off. It didn't take him long to do that. But, it's cheap and useful to protect your seats. If you want really tough good quality protectors, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Great for opening Amazon boxes.,Very sharp but definitely not for any useful cutting of food. I've relegated this knife to cutting open all my future Amazon boxes.
2,too much of serration,I have purchased this as a 3 pc setThe rest of the knives are good but this utility knife is very bad. foe example: if u cut an onion it not at all cuts straight. even the cutting experience is not smooth. i just returned to ja henckels.
4,A word of warning,The USB adapter is very easy to install if you have the service provider that works with it and a computer with the recommended minimual specs. However to make it work with the wii disregard the install cd-rom and go to the [...] website to get the latest driver version.Also the USB adapter doesn't work with some isps such as AOL so call your internet service provider and Nintendo before buying it.Nor does the USB wifi adapter work with MACS.
4,Checkmate!,"This is the first book in the series of the ""misfits"". This story is about a multimillion-dollar conputer chip which vanishes in front of a dozen people. The police suspected the security guard who has the punch code to turn off the alarm. But the misfits believe that Mattie's grandfather is innocent. If Peter, Byte, Jake and Mattie can find out how it disappeared, why, and who was behind the theft, they can save an innocent man. But someone wants to stop them and a series of accidents started happening to them. This story is good but in my opinioin it is not as interesting as the second book of misfits."
1,Fossil,"This is a USB 1.0 product, 12 Mbit/s max, with no Apple driver. BTW, it comes with Windows 2000 and Windows ME drivers, yee-hah!"
3,Wow its cool,"Wow. It's so coool. Doesn't work with windows, linux or macintosh though. But It keeps the papers from flying off my desk! and if I had two of them, I could keep my books standing up.... I recomend buying two."
2,"only has cut depth of 1"" - no more","6-5/8 size is perfect for Juno high hats but unlike the technical specs the cutting depth is only 1"" and a lot less than the Lenox at 1-1/2"" cut depth. Not deep enough to cut through thick plaster much less plaster that has been covered with gypsum board. Often run into old homes with thick plaster with wood lath and none of the recessed light hole saws cut deep enough. Works for 5/8"" thick drywall but then so will an adjustable hole cutter and if you plan on cutting different size hole cutters they are a better investment.If you don't like plaster dust all over the house think about using a Hole Pro shield to catch it all. Mine paid for itself on the very first job I used it. No problems with the 1"" deep Milwaukee hole saw or the 1-1/2"" deep Lenox hole saws.Hole Pro Hole Saw Shield & Arbor Adapter -use with any 1/2"" or 5/8"" threaded hole saw up to 2-1/2"" deep and 6-1/4"" diameter"
5,Excellent knife that holds up well after heavy use,"I have had this knife for several years now and it has never rusted nor lost its edge. It cuts bread like a pro -- as others have said, nice smooth slices as thin or thick as you like, fresh from the oven hot or cooled and aged. It is one of my all time favorite knives and I'm buying a second one to use as a meat slicer, which it also does beautifully -- far better than an expensive meat slicing knife I was given as a gift. Someone said this is not true Henkels, but it is. Don't be fooled. It may be a more inexpensive line, but it works just as well as the top of the line Henkels knives I also own, and unlike those, has never needed sharpening. This is a great buy and if I could only have three knives, this would certainly be one of them.J.A. Henckels International Fine Edge Pro 8-inch Stainless-Steel Bread Knife"
2,"OK knife, but doesn't cut straight","I have the same knife that I ordered with a knife block. I liked it so much that I thought I would order another one. The new knife is NOT the same quality as the previous version (it doesn't say, ""Eversharp"" which the other one I have does, so perhaps that is what the difference is). The new knife is just not as good as the old one."
5,"Best knife ever, worth $50, costs 10","I've had this knife for years, use it for everything and couldn't be happier. I thought it would dull easily or wear down, after all it's only $10, but I was wrong. Simply fantastic for cutting bread, but also useful for vegetables and other tasks. The only thing it doesn't cut well is meat."
1,Good Story!!,This was an inspirational book for me. It teaches that I can get off my butt and make it in America.
5,What a help!,"As a parent of a newly-diagnosed Asperger child, I was overwhelmed. This book was a great help to ease that fear I felt. It was well written and is easily read! I would recommend this to anyone!"
3,"It's not ""Raiders""","""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is my all-time favorite movie. It's what inspired me to pursue a career in television & film production and scriptwriting. So needless to say I had high hopes for this first in the series of Indiana Jones books.Unfortunately, it's not the swashbuckling, action-packed adventure you would expect from the likes of Spielberg and Lucas. It reads more like those old Louis L'Amour westerns my mama made me read when I was laid up with a busted leg after my motorcycle accident - a lot of talking and history lessons with a little bit of action in between. Not really edge-of-your-seat action, but action nonetheless. I recommend it as a lazy day read, something for a plane ride, or for while you're in the dentist's waiting room, but definitely don't expect ""Raiders""."
1,BAD,"I really loved the Indiana Jones movies, and was eager to read the books. But I couldn't get past the first three pages because there had already been at least six swear words! I flipped through some more pages, and there is at least a swear word on each page. I don't even know where they get the idea that the book is for ages 9-12. I don't know a single kid that age who would read that kind of language."
3,An Uncustomary Review,"What attracted me to it? Well...tricky question, that is. The book had been calling me for quite some time. The more I resisted embracing the writer within, the louder its screaming became. You see, Natalie Goldberg writes to the author. She presents the perspective of the aspiring writer while sharing her personal journey through the murky waters of literary creation. I've known for quite some time that words have been adamantly fighting to birth through me but not until recently have I felt ready to let the process start happening. What I've been waiting for, I'm not really sure. The day I started reading Long Quiet Highway was one of the many days when I thought I had completed surrendering to the process. Little did I know...To read the complete review visit The Uncustomary Book Review."
1,this product sucks,I thought your product was very bad. The proconnect was terrible.I was completly unsatisfied. It did nothing of what you said it would do and it was nothing like I excpected. ...-Emily Livingstone
2,Chick lit,"Unlike most married people, Jamie never ditched her girlfriends when she married, yet she still wrecks havoc on her friendship with Voula when she announces that she is trying to have a baby. Somehow, this becomes one of the most prepossessing facts of Voula's life, one more bump in the hilly road of her her life. Between that, finding a new roommate who won't have a noisy affair with her other roommate, facing her issues that haunt the past, and falling in love, again, Voula has a good bit to handle. To simpify her various issues, she thinks, Voula decides to get her own place, and eliminate the roommate problem, but that has its own set of hassles. Through it all, she must be a supportive friend for Jamie, down to listening to the debate over circumsisions pros and cons. Though this story rambles quite a bit, it does have an air of realism and moments of humor that will engage certain segments of the reading public adequately."
3,Good for a beginner,This is a great text as an introductory reference to enthusiasts.Each individual incident is covered only to a very basic level.Would have liked to seen much more information for each event.Text is rather large. Would prefer smaller text and more of it.Definately worth the read.
1,Remove From The Stores,This has to be the worst low budget film I have ever seen. It has no plot. The acting was horrible. It has only one funny seen in it. I don't know what type of life this is suppose to display but I assure you that it is not the life of young black men growing up in the hood where all odds are against them! It appears that they have no idea what it's like to grow up in the hood. I myself walked the streets in Georgia and this is not remotely close to what I have seen in my lifeThe sound quality is all messed up. It sounds distorted. I'm glad I only rented this garbage or I would be upset.
1,Garbage at it's purest...,"Wow, I've never seen a movie so awful in all my life. This movie is the result of 8 or 9 friends getting together one day and thinking to themselves, ""Hey! Lets make a movie! With our connections we could make SOME money.""This movie has no plot, and no direction. It's just a bunch of really crappy actors, with crappy stereotypical urban black dialogue."
4,Great Knives,We really like these knives. We have a set that is about 10 years old and we always find ourselves reaching for them and they have held up really well. We wanted some more for our second home so I purchased a new set. Only giving 4 stars because the new ones don't seem to be of the same quality as the older ones but they are still good. I use them for everything from vegetables to steak.
4,Good for the price.,Very good speakers and awesome sound. There is a problem with the cables becouse they don;t go all in and sometimes come off. Otherwise these speakers are the best for the price.
2,so so,high and lows but no mids. lacks midrange. not impressed. my old logitech system is much better and has a fuller sound.
4,Very good product,"It's pretty much what you'd expect. Only I had a Cambridge 2.1 Speaker set before that ranged in the same price range and was also labelled Creative which had more depth, the cables seemed to be not as flimsy and no blue LED was staring at me (it really is pretty bright in a dark room...). But still the best I could find at this time for that price."
4,Scattershot but still Great Nina,"For those of us who are fans,we know what Nina Hagen is capable of,and at times she Delivers.Return promises more highlights than not,yet after a good handful of years one wonders why the album not only has just ten songs,but one of them""He Shiva Shankara"" has already been released prior elsewhere,and the least interesting ""Hollenzug"" appears twice!!I also feel that the result of using 3-4 diffrent producers on one album emanates a slight lack of continuity of sound and cohesion.Amidst this subtle irritation lies some great tracks that will definitely fulfill our desire to hear Nina doing what she does best-and this albums mix of themes on Spiritualism,U.F.Os,Prophecy,Conspiracy,and alittle of everything else recalls Ninas earlier and more original efforts."
2,Don't Read This Book,This book was not very good at all. The author is clueless beacuse she says they're going into to high school... but they're only 13!!! It was a pointless book that I raced to finish at the end. I didn't even care about the ending...
2,Don't buy these!,"I registered for these because Henckels has a good reputation, but i am really disappointed. The knives are not recommended for the dishwasher and I have hand washed them all. Despite this after one time of using the chopping knife and hand washing it, it has begun to rust. I wish I would have registered for the more expensive knives. In the long run it would have saved me money!"
4,Camay Bath Soap - Alterntive to Expensive Shampoos/Conditioners,"Camay bathsoap is probably among the best I have used. Not dry, not oily, just smooth, and effective to get the dirt out of your body. With Camay, I don't even need any shampoo or conditioner.But I can't understand one thing - for the last five or six months, there is not a single store in the Norristown, PA, region that carries it any more."
4,highly recommended,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know exactly HOW to meet a man. I have read numerous books on this subject and this is the firt one that tells one how to go about meeting someone...not just where to go. It tells you how to get close to someone, what to say, etc...I dont agree with all the advice in the book, such as woman asking men out (Im old-fashioned, I guess!) but despite that, I highly recommend this book as it gave some great ideas and really gets to the point."
1,poor quality knife block,"This set should be rated for Danger----The knife block is not counter balanced, simply nudging the handles of the knives, cause the block to tip forward and spill the knives out! Also the slots for the steak knives are not set wide enough apart; subsequently the six knives cannot fit into the block at once. You would think that spending almost 100 dollars for a knife set would afford a decent block. Also I don't like the strange serrated edge on the Chef's knife-disconcerting when you are chopping with it that the blade grabs onto the cutting board, causing awkward movements.I am very disappointed and will be returning it for a refund."
2,Doesn't cut cleanly,"I bought this set about 5 years ago. The knives have not rusted or stained and have remained more-or-less ""sharp"" - I have never needed to sharpen them.The edge has a special design to keep it permanently sharp - perhaps 50 or so jagged little ""teeth"" per inch.When cutting raw meat, the edge accumulates a glob of meat on the edge which makes it impossible to continue to cut without removing it. Because of this edge, it is very difficult to cut thin slices of soft food. It seems to cut harder foods well, but I suspect it is more like ripping than slicing.Think of these knives as kitchen saws more than kitchen knives.I would not buy them again, despite the low price."
2,"Title and description incorrect! This is only for weight, not cholesterol or hypertension","The title and description for this unit is incorrect. It's a DietMate for weight control only. If you want either the cholesterol or hypertension ones, you have to order them separately on the company's website.As for the units, they appear to have been made in 1991, which means the food options are not up to date. Frankly, many common foods are not in it, even ones that were available in 1991. For example, I've used it for 1 day, and I've already discovered that its food database doesn't have nuts, protein shakes, chicken burgers, soy milk, energy bars, and granola bars. I'm sure I'll find more as I keep using it. The company should issue an updated, more powerful version with a PC hookup for updates."
5,My one year old LOVES it!,"My son adores this book, it is beautiful and very sturdy. He likes to flip through the pages over and over, the book is made of cardboard with sparkly metallic material that shows through cut outs in the pictures, my son loves to tilt the book back and forth and point to the sparkly parts. The text is very soothing and serene without being overly ""childish"" - we highly reccommend!"
1,Universal??? Hardly,"Would NOT fit a 37"" LG LCD Flat Panel or a Samsung 46"" 630 Flat Panel. YMMV. Had to repack and return and end up at a B&M. The vertical pieces are too short."
3,"well built item,but didnt fit my tv","I bought this product for my 42 inch plasma screen t.v., It should have fit perfectly but the holes on my tv were wider then the bracket that mounted to the wall. It was about 4 inches to small. I had to use a bigger bracket for an up to 60 inch tv and that worked out great."
4,Can't argue with the price,"Great Amazon price ... similar mounts are way more expensive at B&M; stores or elsewhere online.Does the job, was pretty easy to install, and allows you to mount the bracket on the studs and then slide the TV over to center it.Only thing that brought it down was the included hex key for tightening the TV to the mount. The ""L"" side was too long and meant I couldn't turn it 360 degrees because it was so close to the wall. The solution: 10 minutes with a hacksaw, cut off the ""L"" side, and throw it in the drill. 30 seconds and the TV was tight."
3,Buy your own screws.,"This product came with all great parts except the bolts/screws that mount it to the wall. 3 out of 4 heads came off while trying to install this item. Also, this item will BARELY fit on your wall. the mount is only a little over 16"" wide, so if you have a newer house, your studs will most likely be too far away."
4,Serves It's Purpose,"This worked well for my Pops 40"" LCD. Seemed a little ""simpler"" than I expected. I would advise that you make sure your TV is listed in the document before purchasing. You might want to get your own bolts for the wall. Ours didnt break or anything, but I can see that happening. Completely worth the money."
2,"Hangs the TV flush, a little TOO flush","The Peerless did not fit my Samsung 23"" LCD tv well.It wasn't quite as universal as I thought it would be. The one wall bracket fit fine, the other went almost straight across where I needed to plug in my power cord to the TV.I somehow plugged the cord into my TV and have the bracket on a slant.Secondly, the Peerless Wall Mount mounts the TV TOO close to the wall.It doesn't allow room for the power cord, which at it's connection point is about an inch and a half long or so. The power cord is pinched pretty bad, and the cable cord isn't pinched as bad, but bad enough.All this is even after I put the spacers in to give the tv more space.If somehow your TV is different, then this will be a great product for you."
2,"Not as ""Universal"" as they claim !","PLEASE READ !!!! Great quality, but to say this mount fits 23-46"" is very misleading. Measure the distance needed between the brackets, this one only expands to 18"". Our 42"" Samsung HPS4253 needed 24"" so this ""universal"" mount was not so universal in our case (so much for fitting up to 46"" TVs). I would strongly recommend going to a name brand site, entering your TV model number, finding the mount you need and then coming back here to Amazon for the best price or a compatible knockoff.On a VERY positive note, Amazon accepted my return, paid for return shipping and I have now ordered the correct mount, after the above procedure!AMAZON ROCKS ! --it just takes a little research sometimes ! Good Luck"
1,not universal,I am sure that the TV's it does fit it works just fine but the bracket did NOT accommodate Panasonic TH-42PX80U.
5,"Fits AKAI 27"" LCD TV/DVD","Finally found one that would fit the AKAI 27"" LCD TV with DVD Player. Tried Circuit City & Best Buy & all units were around $100. Not only did this unit fit, it was cheaper even with next day shipping thanks to amazon prime. I would highly recommend!"
4,Took forever to get this!,"I ordered this from America Rx and it took forever to get here- like 3 weeks! I've only been using this for a few days. I like it so far. It hasn't really cleared up my acne yet, but only time will tell."
4,REALITYS OF A KNIFE FIGHT,"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH, EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES IT DID MOVE SLOW. FINNALY A MOVIE SHOWING THE REALITYS OF A KNIFE FIGHT, PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATE THE DANGER OF GOING UP AGAINST SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE, AND FINNALY THIS MOVIE SHOWS WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU FACE SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE. I AM A STUDENT OF LAMECO ESKRIMA UNDER GURU FELIX VALENCIA, AND THE BOSTON SCHOOL OF ARNIS, UNDER PUNONG GURU GEORGE BREWSTER, AND COMPETED IN KNIFE FIGHTING TOURNAMENTS, AND KNIFE FIGHTS. ALSO THE BRAZILIAN MOB BOSS IN THE MOVIE WHO WAS CUTTING HIS INITIALS INTO THE WOMENS FACES WAS VERY BELIEVABLE, EVEN DOWN TO SHOWING HIS CUSTOM MADE KNIFE AND HOW HE WORE IT. THE MOST COMPLEX CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE WAS HERMES (CHEKY KARO) HE IS AN EXCELLENT ACTOR WHO WE HAVE SEEN IN A LOT MORE MOVIES LATELEY. HE ALSO WAS VERY BELIEVABLE IN HIS ROLE. THE MOVIE SHOWED A DARK PART OF LIFE THAT IS A REALITY, THAT SOME PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO RECOGNIZE."
5,Big Nunn Bush Fan,I've worn Nunn Bush shoes for several years now and have always been completely satisfied...especially with the comfort. My latest purchase was the first pair of slip on loafers and I was not disappointed. They are a great value and a very comfortable shoe.
1,Sorry I bought it,"I didn't like this book at all. I bought it based on the summary and reviews here, but when I got it and read it, I was disapointed. Maybe it just didn't fit my situation, but I found the quizzes silly and the advice just basic common sense."
2,"Good info, but very out dated video, hard to watch!","I bought both Hornady Reloading DVD and RCBS Reloading DVD - I should have just bought the RCBS DVD and returned the Hornady DVD. It had very out dated video footage, old school graphics and, my God, the people speaking in the video put me to sleep."
5,Great watch with loads of features,I am very pleased with this watch. It has tons of features but doesn't require a degree in electronics to program it. I've had the watch for a few weeks and have received multiple compliments from my coworkers. Very glad I bought it.
2,Timex - you get what you pay for,"A pretty nice design. I wanted a analog & digital watch - and that is what this is. The weight of the watch is considerable (heavy), but I got used to that. The analog and digital watches are actually 2 separate 'clockworks'. If they are set to display the same time, one can observe that the two times drift from eachother...An advantage of having 2 separate clockworks is that when the battery runs out on one, the other one still works...After 1 year my watch unfortunaley failed (battery replacement didn't help..). My son's watch (identical) bracelet also failed a couple of weeks later. Although the bracelet is heavy and looks robust, it only goes to prove that a chain isn't stronger than it's weakest link. And in this case, the weakest link...and this one was quite weak...The watch was waterproof and worked well for almost 1 year. I guess I had expected a 50$ watch to last perhaps 2 years...."
3,corrosion issues,"My only beef with this watch is that, after a few months, the stainless steel plating near the winding mechanism starts corroding. Over time, this leaves a very rough surface, which irritates the skin to the point where the watch eventually needs to be replaced. Those that don't sweat alot may not have this issue, but I suspect most people sweat when they work out ;-)"
4,I AM IRONMAN!,"This is a great watch! It has the look and feel of a more expensive timepiece, but the functions, durability, and value you come to expect from Timex. I've already received many compliments, and people don't even know it's the watch from the ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (although don't expect the fancy blue display you see in the movie). Plus I got a great price off Amazon!"
2,Breaks after ~one year!,"This watch looks great, is sturdy, had nice materials and pretty decent functionality, all in a great price (paid under $50).It'd be a solid 4 star watch (because it's lacking a few alarms for example--only has 2), but it BROKE after a bit over a year. The digital functions are still going, but the analog hands have stopped. I still wear it but it's a disappointment. Warranty only covers one year AND you have to buy it from an official retailer, which I highly doubt Amazon is.Never buying TIMEX again."
4,Great watch,"Love this watch... it's the second one I've bought. I'm an analog watch fan but I often want/need digital features like alarms, timezones, timers, etc. The watch looks very sharp without the digital display and is suitable for work. Don't think you can buy a better watch at the price."
4,good stuff,"ok good stuff.i'm just a litlle disapointed that the indiglo light only works for 3 seconds ( in the movie ""harold crick"" ,the ligth start when the watch ring and stay work) but i'm satifacted already.excuse my english ,i'm french"
3,"Nice watch, except for...","The thing you MUST know before buying this watch is that every once in a while the analog hands will partially block the digital readout. It wont do this all the time, and even when it does its only a small annoyance.You can turn off the digital readout, to make the watch look more formal. However, Ive found that this isn't that effective. Dont get me wrong, the watch is beautiful, but (in my opnion) it simply doesnt look like a ""dress watch"". IE it looks better with jeans than with suits...Other than that the watch is great. The indigo, the functions, the build quality... All superbly done... So if you can stand the digital readout being blocked, it a great one to get."
2,Poor quality,"I have owned this watch for a little over a year. Style wise, it was exactly what I was looking for and it had all of the bells and whistles that I like in a watch. Unfortunately, it's poorly constructed. Just after the year mark (so I was just outside of the warranty), the analog watch hands stopped working. The watch band is also starting to fall apart. A watch of this price should last longer than a year."
4,Neat watch...,"Even though I got it at a higher price, it's still worth it. Nice looking watch. I wish there was more functions to it. I don't really like how the timer works, I prefer the classic timer. But in general, I like this watch."
5,the best digital/analog watch i've had,"I really love this watch. It is dressy enough to wear at the office, but has the digital timer for timing my kids track meets. I have had two other digital/analog watches and did not like the very small display at the bottom of the watch face. It is a solid, heavy watch and I don't use it for exercise.As I said, it is the best dress/office worthy digital/analog watch I have found or used."
2,Not like the watch from the movie,"This isn't a bad watch, but I got it because of the movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"". If this is why you are interested in this watch, then forget it... It doesn't do half the things it does in the movie. You can turn the LCD on and off, but that's it. There is no vibrating alarm and the ""indiglow"" feature isn't very bright at all. Also, the analog time keeping and the LCD time keeping won't stay togeather. I was disapointed that Timex misrepresented the watch in the movie..."
1,A not so good watch,"I was very happy to recive this watch and it worked n looked good until like after 3 months of use the belt just broke, walmart cant fix it! you have to keep your warranty n stuff as you have to contact timex to repair it, amazon wont do any thing if the order is more than 30 days old!fells bad when 50 some dollars go waste..so be carefull"
1,Holy horrors abound,How can a loving (deity) parent kill his children indiscrimantely? Only if it's the work of human imagination. The only good thing about this translation is that it was'nt to difficult to read.
2,"A readable, but bad translation","This translation is in a class by itself. It is written in very clear, modern language, but it is not faithful to the Hebrew text! I know Hebrew, and sometimes I compare a part of the Bible that I know in Hebrew to the JPS translation, and it's like I'm reading a whole new text! Also, often, JPS takes the liberty of shuffling words from one verse to another ""for greater clarity"". These instances are pointed out in the footnotes (which are the best part of the book). My personal favorite is the ArtScroll translation of the Bible as it appears in their Stone edition of the Bible. The ArtScroll translation is extremely faithful, and in readable, clear, modern English."
4,best one so far and I've read lots of them,"Excellent translation. The best of any Christian or Jewish attempts. Doesn't paraphrase or use too many modern idioms but also stays away from archaisms. Good balance and the phrasing is fresh,I also have a couple of paperback copies.a study Bible (excellent) and my reading copy for the poower outages."
2,The new JPS bible,"The font size is too small, and is very difficult to read.The distribution of the margins are not well planned, and the size of the book is medium."
4,Great,"I was searching for a non X-tian bible to study the ""Old Testament"" There is no non X-tian translation of the Tanakh so I am very glad that I found this translation. The JPS Tanakh is in my opinion a good translation. The many footnotes aren't disturbing at all but instead very helpful. Everyone who wants to study the Tanakh seriously should buy it. After reading this Bible I became a Noahide instead of a X-tian!!! So if you are a X-tian and want to read this Bible I have to warn you. The truth is not what you are taught and what you used to think it is!!!"
5,Very Pleased,"I was very pleased with this particular translation. The foot notes and references were exactly what I was looking for, and there is also a great history of bible translation in the front of the book"
2,Great if you're just surfing...,"I got this router with 2 equal intentions: Share a DSL line, and host a server with it's port forwarding features. The box has worked great for sharing the line, but has been a nightmare for servers on my lan... the longest it has worked is 1 day, and now it won't work at all. If you're wanting to host a server behind this box, look around at other choices."
1,Would not buy this try the NetGear solution,"After purchasing this product, I hooked it up to my cable modem on one end and my hub for my house on the other end. I found everytime that I turned my computer back on again, that the linksys had locked up and I had to run down to my basement turn the unit off and then back on again before it would work. I sent this same message that you are reading to the customer support email for linksys to get no reply. I returned the product to the store and purchased a NETGEAR Internet Access Gateway Router Model RT311, plugged it in and no problems, been up for weeks now."
1,worst technical service encountered,"I'm no computer expert but I can get by most stuff on my own. With Linksys, I had problem setting it up and I thought I can call them for advice. The technical support was a sham. The guy didn't want to stay on the phone for more than 5 minutes because he had to manage his resources for other users! My call to him was placed at 7 AM eastern standard time and he even admitted that no one was in the queue..but he just didn't want to stay on the phone. Even with any changes he suggested I had to reboot the computer at least once to accept the changes, which takes around 5 minutes and he refused to wait to see if my router was working for my computer. Perhaps Linksys is a good product, but I will never know because I am going to return it to voice my displeasure with their technical support."
4,Security online with Linksys,I find the Linksys routers to perform very well as an addition to a secure home network. I connect the BEFSR41 to the cable modem then connect the WRT54G inline to create a more secure network for my sensitive computers. I can connect my server to the first router in the DMZ and no bad traffic can reach the machines behind the second router. Both routers perform fast and I can't detect any latency.
4,Works Great after proper configuration,"Works Great after proper configuration. Had a problem on Vista. I couldn't get to the internet, to Linksys set up page. Set it up on my XP, no problem. Had to learn how to clone the IP address. Also, tcp/ip settings had to be set to auto-obtain IP address."
3,Linksys support poor,Took me 8 phone calls to help set up two computers. Support agents not too good at troubleshooting.
1,Don't Buy!,"Bought this router and tried to set it up. Couldn't get it to work after spending an hour on the phone with the Linksys support people. They finally said it was defective. Went back to the store to return this router, and bought another one (same model). Same story! Spent another hour on the phone with Linksys; this second router didn't work either. The Linksys support person said this router was also defective. Returned this second router -- total time spent: 4 hours including travel to and from the store twice. And still no router.Solution: went to a different store and bought a Netgear router. The Netgear router worked beautifully right out of the box. It took 5 minutes to set up. It's also much more classy looking than the Linksys router.Moral of the story: DON""T BUY this lousy Linksys router. As I look at the reviews posted here, it seems that more and more people have had trouble with the current Linksys routers. I'd recommend you check out the NETGEAR routers instead!"
1,I can't believe it has such a high rating.,"Essh. Don't buy this router. I'm pretty sure it has such a high rating because people don't give it enough time. A friend recommended this router to me Sept 02. The first router I received had loads of white noise. Living in NYC means cramped apartments, and my computer(s) are in my bedroom. Was impossible to sleep w/ it plugged in. So, I complained and got a second shipped (as my friend's had no audible noise). Same white noise.I was fed up but needed a router so, hoping for the best, just lived w/ it and unplugged the router every night. Lately though, after having the router for less than a year, my cable (RR) connection started dropping. Bypass the router, everything's fine, connect the router, connection drops. This morning, plug in the router and nada. It's dead, no pwr lights. For what it's worth, my friend's router also died two weeks ago.I'd seriously stay away from this manufacturer."
4,EZ to setup - Watch out for advanced features,"The Linksys router was easy to setup as the entire management software is web-based. (including the advanced features, so you do not have to telnet into the box). I have few machines behind the firewall some with dynamic addressing, other with static configuration. VPN once setup properly (no enabled by default on the router), works great, but I read you can only have one VPN connection at a time which can be a limitation. VPN is mostly used nowadays to access corporate servers using your Internet connection. So if you have two machines that need to access your Corporate at the same time on two different companies (yours and your spouse if you work from home), you won't be able to do so.If you need some technical support on advanced features, be careful, linksys web site saysLinksys provides no phone or e-mail support for the advanced features of the router."
1,not a happy camper,"sorry but this item, while it looked brand new, did not work with my computer. Have no way of knowing if it would work for someone else. But it certainly did not work for us."
3,Not Mac friendly,"Plugged everything in and router works fine, though I'm just using it to share an internet cable connection and to have a physical firewall.But the CD that comes with the router is for Windows/PC only, so could not use any of the 'set-up' info and settings...though again often with Macs we don't fuss with all of this.I did check some forums, and found how to log on to the Linksys site and see my settings. If I remember at this site the password and logon is ""Admin"".Sent an email to tech support about sending more info or advice about setup with a Mac running OS 10.4 but never heard back.Unit does seem to be of better quality than old Netgear router it was replacing. One concern I have is whether I'll be able to update the software at the site with the Mac?"
2,An ok produce for home use,"I wouldn't suggest this for business use though. First off Linksys's customer support (is terrible). I've had this for a year now and pressing the reset button has become customary. This is real irritating especially when you have to keep on re-configuring your router (passwords, port forwading, dmz hosting, etc) From reading all these reviews, they seriously overrate this item. But then again I figure that most of this are coming from home users. If a business owner though, reliabilty is an issue with this router. (...) This is a good price for a router though, and it's good for beginners in home networking category."
4,A step above the rest,"I bought a Belkin four port router early last year and have had nothing but problems with it. It continued to lose connection with the net and was a bit of a pain to set up. I jumped onto Amazon.com and found that almost 900 people have reviews this item and out of those 900 people, three fourths of them loved it. That told me something about this product so I went to ...and bought it. You know what? They were right. This thing was SO SIMPLE to set up it was funny. I have never yet lost connection and get near 1 mb download speed with it. It has been a dream come true for me. Not to mention it works with my Xbox live. If you are thinkg about getting a router for your cable/dsl connection, this is the one to go with. The only thing that is wrong with it is when you are standing near eye level with it it makes a high pitched noise that you can't hear as soon as you are below it or more than a foot from it. Other than that this thing is perfect."
4,Its Ok,"I bought this router about a year ago. The ease of installation was very difficult as I wasn't very educated when i purchased it. But once I got everything working OK, it stoped working about a month later. I have always had problems with the router but it usually works good(the problems are on the PC's end). The only thing I do not like about the router is that the DMZ hosting appears not to work, which I kinda need becuase i host alot of video games(I use port forwarding instead). The HTML configurer is also a nice feature. I would definetly recomend this router to anyone who knows what they are doing, otherwise, don't even bother."
2,Mine died too,"Mine did a little better than the person's who worked for 4 months. Mine lost all but one port in 5 months. The set up is great, but if it's going to die so quickly, there are better products out there."
4,BEFSR41 Router,"This router works great for splitting the connection between my Windows and my Mac. I really like it, but wish that the CD wasn't even in there because it is useless. Linksys's tech support is awful too, so I really wouldn't trust a Linksys product other than this."
4,"Easy to Use, even a dummy like me can do it","After several failed attempts to set up a home network, the linksys Router and linksys network cards made the job easy. I successfully networked 3 machines, Win 95, Win 98 SE and Win XP to my cable modem through the router, and the Network is working great."
1,Another crappy linksys product,"When I set up my network a year and a half ago, I purchased this Linksys router and a Linksys modem. Well I replaced the modem about six months ago because it kept dropping my connection. About two months ago my router stopped working and I noticed the diag like was on. Kept trying to reset the modem and I finally called customer service and they told me to throw it away and buy a new one. To me this is a very short life span and I made sure not to purchase another Linksys product. Now I'm running a Motorola modem and a Netgear router and so far no problems at all."
1,Total junk and l;ousy company,"I first tried the Linksys 4 port Cable/DSL router, and it was such a peice of junk. It dropped my connection constantly, it needed to be reset daily in order to work. Linksys tech support was absolutely horribly, and the people there barely spoke english. IThe Linksys is also made of cheap plastic, not very durable at all, the Netgear router is metal, very sturdy. Amazon was awesome when i called them and told them the product was ..., and they accepted my return .... I then got the Netgear RT314, and wow, it has worked without issue for well over a year now, not one single glitch. Their tech support is very fast and generally very helpful, especially when I have contacted them about issues for things I was just trying to do, basically for using it to set up game and ftp servers and such. Excellent buy, don't look at any other company for routers. I am also using one of their Netork Hard drives, print servers, hub, and network cards, all have given me ZERO problems!"
5,xbox 360,i was wondering if this router will work with a mac and xbox 360 for fast realible internet and live
1,Be Warned!,"This product works intermittantly and product tech support is practically non-exsistant. The only people I can reach at LinkSys is Sales or Customer Service. It took me 4 days to set up the network hub portion. (I started with an operational network). Once the network was working I managed to get the DSL connection working on a couple of computers, not all. The next morning when I booted the network; no network and no DSL connection. Then no support. Returning product."
2,Can we talk about slowing the DSL down?,"This product sucks. We have a superfast DSL WAN that works awesome. However, when the Linksys router gets plugged in (routing three computers) our BW drops from 272.8 kbps to a range of 22.5 - 40.0. We checked it on (an internet site's) BW tester.Even if all three of us were up and running - we still can't multiple 40 x3 and get 272.2. We lost 150kbps using it!"
3,Easy to set up but likes to act up sometimes,"When I first got this product I was amazed at its ease of set up with a web interface, and the speed with which I networked my computers together. However, this product does sometimes go AWOL, I've had it a week now, and I've needed to reset it twice as the internet connection stopped responding. Still its working again now, and the speed of my connection has improved considerably."
1,Nothing but trouble,"We get intermittent, frequent disconnects when using the router. I've tried updating the firmware and switching all the cables - no joy. Do not buy this router."
3,Lasted less than two years,"This unit lasted 19 months. I purchased it in November 2001 (from Amazon). Last year, two of its Ethernet ports stopped working and in July 2003 the other two ports stopped working as well.Otherwise, was simple to configure and did its job while it worked."
4,"Excellent product, terrible tech support","Instructions were clear and easy and setup was a breeze. I had one minor problem - wound up being how I had Networking setup on one pc - but I called tech support and was told I'd receive a call back shortly. That was 18 hours ago. I found my problem in the meantime and the product does everything it claims to do. However, if you have a problem and want fast ""24x7"" support (as they claim), don't count on it."
2,Tech Support ???,"Works as advertised -- unless you want to use a LAN IP address other than the default. They claim it is possible to change this address. I couldn't. Maybe I did something incorrectly but, I have sent 4 Emails to Tech Support asking for help and not heard back yet. The first request was over 3 weeks ago. I have called Tech Support twice and was on hold so long both times that I gave up. I Emailed Netgear Tech Support to check on their LAN IP address setup and to test their Tech Support. I received a helpful response in 8 hours (over night) I plan to purchase the Netgear RT314 to replace my Linksys BEFSR41. I may have a problem with the Netgear LAN IP address too but, at least I know Netgear Tech Support exists."
2,"Works Now, But Tech Support Poor","First of all, I have America Online (AOL) as an ISP and it is compatible with very few routers. Linksys is one that claims to support AOL. Could not get it to work initially. I went through four days of back and forth with AOL and Linksys and never could get Linksys on their tech support line--waited over 90 minutes one time. AOL said ""not our our problem, dude!"" both times I called them (those of you comtemplating AOL as your Internet provider, are you listening?) Linsys' web site has some good support documents, but nothing that helped me enough to get up and running. Finally established an email dialogue with Linksys and got it worked out, although they too initially took the ""not our problem"" approach. Works great now, but really not worth the hassle."
3,"great router, but...","This router is really easy to set up, but the instruction manual is completely useless if you're a Macintosh user. You can sort of bluff your way through it and infer, but if you're not computer savvy you might have a hard time. Tech support over the phone is responsive, but they kinda treat Mac and Linux users like aliens.I purchased this router back in June. By September it started acting up on me. Suddenly, my ping rates dropped to 70% loss and I wasn't able to run limewire. I bought the exact same router and after entering all the same settings, the new router is running great (again). Hopefully that was a fluke and this new router will last more than 3 months.My last gripe has to do with dynamic IP. Every now and again my provider changes my IP address, and I have to manually refresh the router to see the new IP address. I would've hoped that it woul detect the change on its own. If it's supposed to...well, mine doesn't."
4,networking,Was very easy to get a home network going especially with the CD. I was up and running in a matter of minutes without rewiring my home for other computer use for my children.
4,Splitsville,"Hello All,I purchased this unit as part of my multi-layer approach to computer security. While there are many other brands that I could have purchased the fact that 99% of routers that my clients are using are Linksys models this alone speaks volumes. The setup of the unit was painless and in less than 5 minutes, I had the unit configured and working flawlessly. I would not hesitate to purchase this unit again nor would I hesitate to recommend it to anyone needing a unit like it.Ciao!"
5,Tech Support Was Great,"I just purchased this router and found the technical service to be excellent. I needed some help configuring my pc to the router, and despite the Christmas busy season the Linksys technical department answered the phone within two rings. The technician was very responsive and within ten minutes she was able to fix the problem. I never received such quick and competent service from other computer companies. I would recommend Linksys technical department above all others."
1,They don't support their product,"I read all the great reviews and plunked down the $150. I installed it and all the basic features worked well. I then tried to use the advanced features and ran into constant problems. I'm sure most were caused by my inexperience, but the flimsy documentation and total lack of support were maddning. When you call tech support, they call you back days later at odd hours only to tell you ""Sorry I can't tell you that, we only support the basic features"" I thought my questions were pretty basic and I received no help. Good product, bad documentation and REALLY BAD customer support."
5,"Great Product, a must have","This product was so easy that my computer illiterate mother could have set it up. I got this in combination with a Linksys Cable modem, and they are a great combination. All that the Router required for setup was to be connected (picture diagrams included) and you needed to make sure that 2 boxes were checked in the network properties setup page, very detailed instructions on how to do this. Then just shut everything down, including the router, turn it back on, open Internet Explorer, enter 192.168.1.1 and you are automatically taken to the router configuration page where you check about three more things, then just restart one more time and your ready to go. Easiest home network I have ever installed. No networking experience needed, very wonderful instructions. Definate 5 stars."
2,Reliability concerns,"Very easy to setup and once setup, pretty much maintenace free. You have heard all that, BUTmy first router quited after 11 months and 2 weeks. The connection was intermittent. Took a weekend to isolate and identify the source of the problem. Its the router's (not the cable modem, the ISP network, the network cards, the OSs or the computers connecting to the router). Customer support is so so. Gone thru the diagnostic routines quite a few times before support admited that the router was bad. Took three to four weeks and many emails/phone calls to get a replacement. Replacement was a DOA. Took another 3-4 weeks to replace the replacement. Make you wonder its reliability. With the life cycle expectancy of the router in mind, I am shopping for a replacement. and it is not going to be a linksys."
3,they are still selling version 1???,"version 2 (BEFSR41 v2) has been out for at least 9 months. If the information is wrong and this is really version 2, then its a good deal. otherwise find a version 2 elsewhere"
2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly...","Easy to set up, I had it running within 10 minutes. Worked fine for about 10 minutes, than I would lose my connection. This continued to happen and every time I would use the web interface to correct the problem, it just made matters worse. In Linksys' defense, I am not sure if it was a hardware issue or ISP issue. My guess is that it is the lack of good PPPoE support in the firmware. Coincidentally, I ran into someone who, with the same ISP and hardware, experienced the same problem. Needless to say, I returned it and purchased the Asante router, which works great."
3,"Easy to set up, but could have lasted longer","This router is very easy to set up, as others have pointed out. The bad thing with it is that it lasts as long as the warranty- about 1 year. The 1st one died in a few months. My 2nd one is on its last leg after about 1 year. 2 of 4 ports died last week. I thought this kind of stuff lasts longer than that, especially with no moving parts.I do have to say that I don't know if other brands will last longer than 1 year, though."
1,No Service After Sale,"I have had problems with this router since I opened the package. I called the Linksys ""customer service"" line before buying to check a few things - I got a quick response and assurances that the router would serve my needs.AFTER buying, customer service was not to be had. When you call in, you press a differnet number than for new buyers, you get put on hold for a long time, then someone comes on to tell you that they will take your number and have a tech person call back. THEY NEVER CALL BACK. I left three such call-back requests over the span of two weeks. Several weeks later I got lucky and got through to tech - but they could not answer my question and were very rude.In addition to very offensive customer disservice, the Linksys router seems to not be handle two computers' simultaneous use of the DSL connection for an extended period (>1/2 hour)- isn't that why you buy it?"
5,In the age of high speed access... this is the unit to get,"I'm going to keep this short. Why? Because how many times can you give this unit 5 stars? It works great on my Pacbell DSL connection. Also acts as a firewall. Multiple ports for a few more computers if you've got a home network. One of the best features, it works with XP (becuase it's not software) and there is no need for specialized connection software which can sometimes slow the boot up time. Removing the software from my ISP and letting this router do the job was an increase in performance alone."
1,Can't use router,Can't install router because there is something that keeps the computer from recognizing it. I tried everything that I was told to do.
1,"Went bad after 5 months of use, always dropped connections",I bought this router 5 months ago and it just went bad. My normal internet speeds are 20MBPS download / 4MBPS upload. Today my connection speed went down to 4 MBPS download / 1MBPS upload. After doing some troubleshooting I found that the router wasn't working correctly. As soon as I plugged my computer directly into my cable modem and got my full 20MBPS download / 4MBPS upload back. But when I plugged this router back into the modem my speeds went back down again. I tried several known good ethernet cables and ended up with the same results. For the time being(until I get a new wired router) I have my cable modem plugged into my wireless router and everything is working perfectly and I have my normal internet speeds back. I do not recommend this router to anyone looking for reliability.
4,Easy and Simple,"This router is extremely simple to set up, I just plugged it in to my cable modem and a pc and in minutes was up and running. I spend 10 times the setup time in reading the instructions, but getting it working was simple. There was absolutely no need to go into the setup to connect to the internet (although I had to contact AT&T as they lock the connection to a mac address on the network card).I have two computers networked using this and they use a full 100MBs, transporting data has never been this fast before. I still have two ports open for future use, and if I wanted more there is a wan port that I could use to set additional machines via another router, this devices supports up to 256 unique devices through its ports and wan connection."
1,Linksys Software and Customer Support Problems,"I purchased this unit and ended up spending most of my Saturday night attempting to get it to work. Apparently, the software it ships with has some bugs, such as not letting get past their password screen, which then requires you to download and flash an update. In calling technical support be prepared for long waits. I had to call twice and waited 45 minutes each time only to get a technician that did not completely understand their product. After much frustration, he determined that the router was defective and would have to be sent back. He also informed me that it may be necessary to change the pin set-up on my cat 5 enhanced cable as the router has compatability issues. Due to the product being DOA and poor customer service I would recommend spending a little more money on a better designed product."
1,Unit Failed After 3 months,The unit failed after 3 months of normal use. No support from the company. Nothing to do but put it in the landfill. Avoid this company.
3,recomend for the price,bougt it as a refurb 6 months ago no problems yet upnp works great port forwarding works as it should even has clone mac address option has lots of features built as if it was a higher end router worth da price linskys wired router
1,Not compatible with AT&T DSL,"I used this for 3 months before upgrading to Windows 7. Don't know if the upgrade had an effect, but the router never worked well after that. I spent about 8 hours with Linksys and they wound up blaming AT&T. Spent more hours with AT&T who were quick to blame Linksys. Dead end here and no guarantee. I wound up buying an AT&T modem/router which installed easily and works fine so far. Beware using this router if you have AT&T DSL."
5,what a great product,"This was exactly what I was looking for when I got my cable connection. Easy to set up, took 15 minutes! If a friend comes over with his computer, easy to plug them in on the network to share the connection or just swap some files. And the firewall is great for protecting my computer from the rest of the net! I love this cable router and HIGHLY recommend it."
4,Great for the price. SOME Problems,"For the price this is the best router on the market. It has a 4 port SWITCH, which is actually faster than a hub. It integrates flawlessly into the network and installation couldn't be simpler. All you do is plug all the computers in, set them to use DHCP connection, set up the router with the easy to use internet interface, and you're ready to go.SOME PROBLEMS though... Many users have reported that large downloads become corrupted. Also, it is difficult to upgrade with MacOS. Most of these issues, however, have been fixed with new versions of firmware. I would recommend this router to anyone needing a simple wasy to connect their small or home network to one internet connection. ..."
1,Lemon,"This router is a lemon. If you need to use PPPoE, which is techspeak for dial-up DSL, don't use this router. It is supposed to reconnect you if your provider drops the line, but instead, it hangs the router, and you need to pull the power plug and put it back in again to make it start working. It may be cheap, but it's faulty."
1,Terrible,"Lots of problems, even with windows XP. some of the lines on the router work but some don't. So you cant get internet access on each line off the router. Not worth your money. Netgear i heard is better. I despise of this product. I know lots about computers and this doesn't work well:("
1,Poor,I'm done attempting to connect this unit. Connection has failed repeatedly. Would not recommend this unit.
4,Pretty good router,THis router works great for the two computers that we need wired for our house. For some reason ive had trouble connecting more than 2 uses to the router though...but the third and fourth arent needed. Good router. Good price.
4,Good Product With a Bad Problem,"I have two of these units, one at work and one at home.The one at home works great. I have 3 pc's hooked into it. One Linux box and two win9x boxes. I have had no problems. For a SOHO this is the router to get!The problem I found was with the configuration I had at my office. The one I have there kept corrupting e-mail attachments and web page images. The only thing that was different was the fact that I had the Linksys unit hooked up to a 24port switch which in turn was attached to 10 pc's on the LAN. I tried to ""uplink"" the Linksys to the switch and tried to ""uplink"" the switch to the Linksys with no results. I was forced to use something other than the Linksys for my routing needs. The Netgear RT311 worked great and no problems have occured to date.I worked with this for a week I hope this helps you avoid the problem I had."
4,"product works, but delivery was not great","The product itself shipped late, but I was notified rather quickly that it would be late. But when it did finally arrive the box was rather smashed and I was surprised that it worked properly. I'm not sure if this a shipper complaint or a postage complaint, but either way, that was the most negative thing about it and this seller that I encountered."
4,Entertaining!,"I gotta say, it's probably the most action packed lawyer show ever! I really enjoyed Harm's escapades; I'm a big fan of both Meg and Pike. What leaves me a bit with a bitter taste is the sheer impossibility of the show. I am sure everyone knows this, but a JAG lawyer would never retain the privileges of flying a Tomcat or go on missions with SEALs. Apart from that, very enjoyable :-)Oh, and I think we see the courtroom all of one time during the first season..."
3,"Great, but not quite what I was expecting...","Those looking for an insightful peek into the origins of those enigmatic nursery rhymes will probably not be disappointed by Chris Roberts' Heavy Words Thrown Lightly: The Reason Behind the Rhyme. Taking many of the best (and lesser) known nursery rhymes, Roberts puts them in historical context and dissects them (in an entertaining fashion) in order to reveal how these seemingly harmless rhymes often commented on the social and political climates of their day, as well as on subjects less couth. This book's chief failing is that it is sometimes difficult to discern where Roberts' sarcasm and conjecture ends and the actual facts begin, making this book, perhaps, a doubtful resource and more of an entertainment. Worth reading, nonetheless."
4,Great for boning poultry,"This is a great boning knife. It's very flexible so it makes it easier to go around bones of chicken and meat, also works great to fillet a fish. It's not at all heavy, so your hand doesn't get tired after a while. It's also a great price. If you're looking to buy a boninge, knife, this is the one."
2,If Only....,"First off I don't quite hate these knives... I do however dislike them quite alot.My wife brought these into our combined kitchen (she loves them)so I use them once in a while but on soft items like raw chicken they just pull and make a mess.I have some Nice henkles that I brought that live in the closet in the other room, when ever I am doing anything in the kitchen I take the walk to get them, Sharper and Safer IMHO then the eversharps. Plus the eversharps do not fell right in my hand..."
5,A good knife.,This is a very good knife set.Cuts very easily and very well.My mother used one at camp and just had to have one (or a small set and probly not the last).
3,"To all those with an ASUS, it the G75V 17.3in Computer.","Bought this bag in hopes it would fit my ASUS G75V ROG 17.3in Computer. It does, snugly, but still provides protection. The bag itself has a lot of room for the rest of all my stuff. Some flaws though that made me remove some stars. One would be the back flap, held by buckles, could use some elastic netting along the side. I could store more stuff in there without worrying that it would fall out. Another design flaw would be the front buckle that goes around your chest. Its quite low, which isn't really a problem, but if you don't want to use them, they hang low and can be quite annoying. There is no way to round up the loose strap from hanging and hitting my sides/legs.All in all its a great backpack, and a good choice for someone who has a ROG computer, and worried if the extra bulkage of it would make it too big. It fits nice and snugly with no real hassle. Great choice. We'll see how it handles the ""time"" factor."
4,A must read for supporters of capital punishment,"Anyone who supports the death penalty should read this book. It should change their mind about the wisdom of killing people. This book exposes the awful truth of the criminal justice system - which is often more about winning at all costs, than truth or justice. A great book. The story itself merits 5 stars, but the writing is not as good as other true crime/criminal justice books I have read. Indeed, if you like this book, read ""May Have God Have Mercy,"" another shocker about the truth of capital punishment and the killing of an innocent man."
4,Shocking,"Shocking. I wonder if this book has made anyone think twice about having (more) children? It seems to me that most of what he is saying comes down to human overpopulation...But I think Wilson could be more flat-footed early on. He attempts to give both sides of the story, when most of his readers (who've read Consilience before, at least) already know exactly where he stands."
3,"Well read, not so well produced","The reader, Ed Begley, Jr., reads this book clearly and with good phrasing. The abridging is not heavy.Only one complaint: 6 CDs with NO TRACK INDEX! This means that the CDs are useful for listening to straight through only. The user can only guess which chapter will be on which CD, and there is no way (that I know of) to jump to a specific part of the book on the CD, because there is only one track per CD."
2,Cuts fairly well but already showing signs of rust,"I purchased these knives in early June and have used them every couple of days and in just over a month, two knives already have what appears to be rust spots on them. As far as their functionality is concerned, they're pretty sharp and have been able to perform any task I've put them to (however, I have never used them to cut any meat product so I don't know how they handle steaks). I gave them a lower rating due to the fact that they've rusted already."
5,Fun Look at Celebrities,I really enjoyed this book. It had a fun take on celebrity. Let's face it we always knew celebrities were a little wacky to begin with and this proves it in a fun way. The book is loaded with a lot of great lists like a list of actors with the biggest private parts. You'll never guess who made it on that list! A list ot weird names stars give there children. It made me feel kind of sorry for Bruce and Demi's children. A list of who's been in rehab. It's filled with a lot of interesting lists. The one thing I did not like about this book was that the author seemed to have it in for Melanie Griffith. I do not know if the author is male or feamale. But it seemed very obvious to me that he/she was jealous of Melanie for being married to Antonio Banderas. I feel that the author's treatment of Ms. Griffith was uncalled for. But other than that it was a very enjoyable read. I would most definetly reccommend it to those who are curious about celebrites.
2,Casual writing style distracts me from getting the point,"Comparing with the other SQL Server 2000 books, this book does a poor job explaining the details of the database software and I found the writer's casual writing style very distracting from the point. If you are serious in learning this technology, I'd suggest Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming or Inside SQL Server 2000."
3,"Great book, poor index","This is a great book. It's throughout and easy to read. Every time I've turned to it, it has the information I need.Unfortunately, it is plagued by a poor index. Even the most basic SQL is missing from the index. For example, if you are interested in the TOP clause, you won't find it between ""tools, developer"" and ""torn-page detection"". Instead you need to look under ""Select statement, rows, return few (top keyword)"".With a better index, this book would be more than a great learning tool, but a great reference tool too."
5,The torch bearer by which rock guitar can now be measured.,"I really didn't know anything about Joe Bonamassa.I saw this at a friends house the other night (non-blu ray). Without a doubt in my mind Joe is the best known rock - blues/rock guitarist of the day. I had not realized how well he can sing also. There are some simply stunning moments. His duet with Clapton on ""Further On Up the Road"" is just incredible and Bonamassa plays as good as the master. There are many, many other standout performances here. He's the real deal, a very rare talent, enormously gifted. What comes across is that this guy is very humble and extremly hard working. He's not a virtuoso Diva who takes his talent for granted. I kook forward to hearing more from himMy buddy had the audio piped through his stereo and the sound was pitch perfect."
5,pleased,"Money well spent, please play loud....never corny or cheesy. Let a player play.I have many dvd concerts and I often hope for perfection. Only to find that I did not really like the music or the artist that much, or the production/sound was poor. But in this case, ALL of it, music/sound/production, were phenomenal.This guy is a 'Rock Star'.......his sound/production was perfect. Even, down to, turning off those production companies' logo's and theme songs.I am a guitar fan and somehow this guy had slipped underneath my radar. But I am pleased to have discovered him, at the same time that he put out a DVD concert. Joe Bonamassa Live from the Royal Albert Hall."
5,WOW,This is the beat Guitar DVD I have ever purchased. I love the song Woke Up Dreaming! However' this DVD is packed with GREAT songs and highly Entertaining!!!!!
5,Fantastic Performance - Bravo...!!,"Absolutely awesome concert - loved the likes of ""High Water Everywhere"" with the two drummers and acoustic guitar. Something about saving the best until last and watching the DVD extra ""Wake Up Dreaming"" track - which probably is the most amazing acoustic performance I have ever seen.One can only imagine how it was to realise a 20 year dream to play the Albert Hall - and it was a flawless performance to be savoured often."
2,Poor Blu-ray,"I have owned both the DVD and this new Blu-ray. True: the DVD is exceptional!! Awesome video and audio! The Blu-ray audio is same...Great! BUT, the video quality on the Blu-ray is WORSE than the DVD! Especially the white or light sections such as Joe's face....Very fuzzy and pale. TOTALLY disappointing. Do NOT upgrade your DVD for Blu-ray in this case....NOT worth it."
1,"When it's Bad-it's Very Bad!,","Previous reviewers have VERY charitably given this movie 4 stars. They should have their heads examined. Made on a budget that would not buy a small used car, this movie stinks. The ""special effects"" are not very special, the acting is wooden and the script is awful. They don't come much worse than this. Even the SyFy channel would be embarrassed to air this travesty. To sum it up, this movie is not even good enough to be considered ""camp"". Don't waste your money!"
5,excellent guide,I found this book to be very helpful to find the shows in PA and in the surrounding states. I look forward to getting the next issue.
3,Thrilled,"I was thrilled that I was able to locate ""Goldstein"", which was filmed in 1963 in Chicago. I had a very small speaking part, and this particular scene was filmed at the ""Gaslight Club"" in Chicago where I worked in the early 1960's. The entire film was improv and the originator of ""Second City"" also has a part in the film, as did some of the original improv actors.I can't wait to show this film to my grandchildren."
3,Chicago Guide-Not so great,"I found the cost to quality/content ratio of this book to be fairly poor. The pictures are pretty good but small and there isn't as much up to date info on the houses as I had hoped for.Many of the houses listed were classified as private, view from street. I found little value in these listings.You'll get more off of FLW Websites and it will cost less!"
3,Blade the comic book not the novel,Would appreciate the Site indicate whether the book is a movie-tie in novel or a graphic comic book. I was hoping it would have been the novel but no dice
1,I'd give it zero if I could....,"Please don't waste your money on this. All of these quotes can easily be found by googling ""family qoutes"". Most likely, the first page you go to will have them. I was hoping to find some new inspirational quotes about families, but this was a real disappointment."
2,Hard Sell,"The title describes what it feels like when the book slams into your head after you fall asleep reading it. Bland, dull and obvious, all that in the first chapter. Based on the outline of the story I thought this would be an interesting book. This book is a rehash of a good cop, bad cop pair that take on a group of very nasty criminals and win in the end. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the &#65533;dark, brooding&#65533; lead and he did not pull it off. Overall, this is not that great of a book. There are many others out there that are better."
2,"Good price, Bad FM Transmitter","Everything about the unit is OK except the transmitter. There is a high pitched whistle that ranges from annoying to barely noticeable, and exists in all 5 or 6 frequencies. Sort of like really bad tinitis. I only use it for audio books, so there is very little to drown it out."
3,Expected a bit more,I thought the knives would have been a better quality. I don't like the feel of the handle and its really light. I could have found better for the price locally.
5,superb value,"I've used this pot for several months now and have been thoroughly pleased everytime! Not only is it a very attractive piece, but it performs incredibly well. Great heat distribution, nothing burns in it, and the non-stick coating is very effective. I am beyond impressed with bang-for-the-buck on this and plan to buy more of this series from Cuisinart. I am an avid cook (by no means a professional), and see no reason to use the brands that cost 3X as much."
2,OK for indoor use,"I don't know how to review this. On one hand, I had intended on putting it outside, knowing it might deteriorate in the weather and it did. On the other hand, it took it several weeks to deteriorate. I suppose it would be fine if I left it indoors. I liked the item when it arrived. Nothing special"
2,World's shortest DVD,"I expected this to be a 45 minute production or at least a 30 minute show. Instead it is like 5 minutes long. Can you call 5 minutes of flat video, shot locked down on sticks, a ""documentary?"" No awards pending here!I've never felt ripped off before because a DVD as to short! I certainly did when I played this - the world's shortest DVD production. The shots are fine for the duration of the 5 minutes, but there's nothing new here you couldn't find on the internet for free. Burn me once, shame on me! Perhaps it's time for someone to do a serious show on Cymatics. It is -- apparently -- an open market (no competition from this product).Cymatics is an incredibly important subject as it verifies the existence of the aether in a simple mechanical manner. This is topic in need of a serious documentary show. This is not it."
5,"Exciting, truthful account of our present loss of freedom","The current presidential regime is frighteningly similar to that of Abraham Lincoln, who also suspended the Bill of Rights in the name of ""national security"" during the Civil War. A must-read if you fear the direction the nation is taking."
1,The Title is Very Apt,"Taken from the 8th Amendment- ""nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,"" the title better describes the tormenting of truth with which Mr. Miller's polemical polygot is replete then it does his imaginary Bushian tyrany. The left wingnuts here will no doubt wax ecstatic over the typical liberal name-calling, and Amazon will no doubt strictly enforce its rules against any use of such by right wing critics of this latest bit if filth from Miller. A last thought, the libs wentover the past few days crazy attacking their erstwhile hatchet man Zell. Will they object to we conservatives savaging this Miller?"
2,Terrible reproduction,"The book itself is complete, but the reproduction is terrible. It is so exceedingly pale that it is almost impossible to read. I could have done a better job with a home photocopier! This was my first experience with a ""books-on-demand"" reproduction of an out-of-print/out-of-copyright publication, but I shall not repeat this frustrating experience. In short, the quality is inexcusably awful."
1,There is better work published,This book purportedly is about cybernetics and systems thinking however it fails badly at it. The author choose a write about it in the format of a 1930's detective novel. It comes off bizarre IMO and fails to convey anything of usefulness. If you want to learn systems thinking and cybernetics you are much better off obtaining The Art of Systems thinking by Joseph O'conner and System Thinking Basics from Anderson and Johnson.
1,don't bother,I thought this would be good for my son to take to school for hot lunches. The very first time I used it I found it leaks if there is liquid inside. He had to carry it by the handle and keep it upright. The worse part was he never got lunch that day at all. The lid locked on so tight no one at school or home afterwards could get the lid off. The hot contents made it seal so tight the hulk couldn't get it off. So for the price it was not worth it. Now I can't tell if the food stayed hot but what good is it if you can't open it.
4,Good forms,"I wish there was a place to put these into a digital format, but beyond that it serves its purpose."
4,strap attack!!!,"This product works great but the vibrator allthough powerful stopped working after the second use and I find it allmost impossible to find the type of batteries it takes. There is a slit behind the base of the dong where the vibe slides into that exposes the foam on the inside that makes it kind of ugly, and once it is in place and inside you the vibrations are pretty weak. The dong itself is great! It does good on its own too and has a suction cup on the base. Its shape allows to insert one bump at a time, its big and Im amazed I got it in but with some lube slides like a dream."
5,An excellent resource,"The authors present a helpful picture of church unity at the end of the millenium. Far from being anti-Catholic, the authors point out differences in the core beliefs of the reformed faith and the Catholic faith. Highly recommended."
4,Good coverage of the essentials,Covers the primary points that executives should look for in ensuring project success. Build these issues into your organization.
3,Marginal value,"Not exactly a ""book."" At 31 pages this provided some good summary information, but is more of a white paper in pdf format."
3,"good knife , weird handle","I like the knife , but the handle has a funny feel in my hand. Maybe someone withlarger hands would like it better. I like the Henkels with normal shaped handels better."
2,Stealers Wheel WITHOUT Gerry Rafferty / Joe Egan!,"The CD ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" by K-Tel records contains RE-RECORDINGS of several Stealers Wheel songs, one Joe Egan solo song, and two 'new' songs (""Let it Ride"" sounds like it could have been an unused song from back when). However, the original vocalists/songwriters Gerry Rafferty [rest in peace] and Joe Egan are not present. BUYER BEWARE!""After being contacted by iTunes and K-tel records in California, Tony Williams re-formed Stealers Wheel in Blackpool in 2008 with two other original band members, Rod Coombes and Paul Pilnick, together with locally based musician and songwriter Tony Mitchell. On 10 November 2008 they started filming a music video for a re-release of ""Stuck in the Middle"" on the Fylde coast. They also began writing songs for an album due to have been released in 2009, although they have no plans to go on tour."""
2,Not Entire Concert,"This DVD is the live concert version that is available on a 2 CD set, but it only contains 11 of the 20 plus songs on the CD set. I was disappointed that it was not the entire concert and do not understand why some of the best known songs were not picked to be on the DVD. Since there is no track listing provided by Amazon for this DVD (which would have influenced my decision to buy) I'll list it for other.1. Timbiriche2. Somos Amigos3. Princesa Tibetiana4. Si No Es Ahora5. Mama6. Mirame7. Soy Un Desastre8. Tu y yo somos uno mismo9.La vida es mejor cantando10. Hoy tengo que decirte papa11. Corro, Vuelo, Me AceleroBonusEsta Despierto (video)Entrevistas (Interviews ca. 5 minutes)"
1,not an lg battery,"i got this battery because they are advertising it as an lg battery, well its not and my phone doesnt work with it. every time that i try this battery in my phone it says not a genuine product and shuts my phone off"
4,"Making Content Comprehensible for English Language Learners: The SIOP Model, Second Edition",Very practical book. It includes a checklist and lesson plan template in the back. Very useful!
3,"Making Content Comprehensible for English Language Learners: The SIOP Model, Second Edition",a little boring but has some good worksheets/guidelines. I would not buy this book if it weren't a class requirement. Amazon provided great and speedy service.
2,Pass this one up!,"I have been in software development for the past 20 years, from IBM mainframe to client/server environments. I needed to ""get in"" on the new technology. I created the development environment I thought was needed to make the most of this book. It carried me, step-by-step, through development methodology in client/server development. However, the web applicaton development portion of the book is sorely lacking in usable information. I found the guidance somewhat lacking in understandable instruction concerning development for web applications. The downloaded program listing doesn't compile correctly, because of a lack of a class. The class is developed in the book, but there are no instructions on how to incorporate the class. Also, SQL Server is used as a database, but no reference is made to it as necessary to create and run the listings in the book."
1,Fictionalized story should not be considered to be a Legend,"Readers beware and do not buy the book. This book meets Eliot Singer's definition of multicultural fakelore. Yes, King Sejong is credited for inventing Korean Alphabet but this book is a fictional creation by the author and the traditional community is totally unaware of it. Korean Americans I know who have read and seen the book is equally horrified that this book is being sold as a Korean Legend when they have never heard of such story. Other reviewers talk only of how the story can inspire others and how wonderful the illustrations are ignoring the fact that it is titled as a traditional legend of Korea when it is not. The title should be changed. My excitement of finding a book about Korean Alphabet quickly turned into a huge dissapointment. Please vote with your wallet--do not waste your money."
5,"Thar she blows! And no, I am not a hunter! Of whales or any animals!","This is one of the best nature books I ever read. It has lots of cool and interesting facts and photos on and of porpises, dolphins, and of course whales. It tells things of how they live that you might have never heard before! The photos are just beautiful, especially those of orca whales, and the stories and events you'll read about are beyond description. Not to mention the way this will move you. I also love this book because in the same way the 8 big cats, hyenas and wolves are my favorite land mammals of all time, whales, dolphins and porpises are my favorite sea mammals of all time. This book will help you or your teenager children learn a lot, and I recommend it to all. Oh, and another thing. This will also teach you not to f*** around with the rights of other living beings, whales, tigers, wolves or anything in between. End."
5,Peter the Great - Man of Many Faces,"This is one outstanding and primarily historically accurate video on one of Czarist Russia's most intriguing and successful leaders of all time. From his successes to his failures, this film takes YOU through the emotional fluctuations of his rule, affairs, intentions and consequences. It is one of the finest historical dramas ever produced. The cinematography is flawless and exquisite. Its 6 1/2 hours seem like 3 or 4. AWESOME, Truly AWESOME... in the original sense of the word."
1,Not as advertised,The cord I received was not what was advertised.Chinese knock off reflects the 99 dollar price.Dissapionted with false ad on Amazzon.
4,Great Item,it was so easy to hook up! i was so happy i could do it myself and my boyfriend was just as impressed...
5,Worked as an adapter for my Sony LCD,I bought this hoping I could use it as an adapter for my Sony flat screen. The price was right and it worked perfectly with my Mustang wall mount. A very cheap alternative to buying the $400 Sony brand wall mount.
2,Does not hang well...,"Took heavy to hang in a cubicle - the velcro will not hold the heavy acrylic. Also, the magnets are not strong enough either."
2,Cheaply Made Tach,Like my title says the tach is cheap. Went to hook it up to my 96 S10 and it needs an $35 adaptor but it doesnt tell you unless you look at a list they include with it. So it goes from $35 for the tach to $70 for the tach and adaptor. There are many cars and trucks that need the adaptor so i suggest you read up before ordering. Also the lighting in mine doesnt work because it's a cheaply made tach. Id recommend an Equus tach or Autometer over a Sunpro anytime.
2,works for a while,Bought one for my 69 stang. worked and looked great for about 1 and 1/2 years. now it only will read after 1500 rpm. checked and re-installed wires and changed my ground to make sure that it was my tach and not installer error. Still the same problems. They work good for awhile if you need a cheap temp tach. i will be looking into an equus or an autometer tach next. You get what you pay for.
1,Sun Tach,I'm a old guy that bought the REAL Sun tachs back in the 70's. The old ones lasted more than a year like this one did.
2,Disappointed...,I just don't find this to be a good or inspiring read... I'm very disappointed in it and personally don't care for the book.
1,If selfish magic is your cup of tea then buy this book.,"This book, like all her others, has nothing to do with being a Wiccan Witch, but is instead is bent on using nature magic forpurely selfish purposes such as gaining wealth and power, whilst attempting to circumvent the force of Karma (the ""path of least resistance"" as she calls it).If you have any interest in the Wiccan religion at all I suggest you read The Wiccan Path: A Guide for The Solitary Practitioner by Rae Beth. On the other hand, if you don't care in the slightest about the knowledge and wisdom behind the Wiccan faith and would rather have a villa in the Algarve than help others then this book is probably right down your street.Blessed Be,whetphish."
1,Lacking in Power,"Installed in a boat. Very weak flow (<1 GPM). The pump seems signficantly underpowered. Also, not a true self priming pump. I will need to look for an alternative."
3,worth a read for a lay person,"Is this the end all and be all of emergence theory? Of course not. But if you are interested in delving into emergence theory and you are a lay person this is a good entry point with fascinating examples. The story of how ant colonies perform more efficiently, building on the generations that go before is fascinating. Concepts like path dependency, institutional memory, incentive systems for learned behavior may not stick with you, but the stories describing them will. Science writing can be dreary, tendentious and dull. This book isn't."
2,disappointing,"the theme of this book is quite interesting, and the first few chapters do not disappoint. however, the author starts to drift in the middle section, and loses control completely in the last chapter which resembles a kind of non linear brain dump. the paperback is probably going to provide more value, especially to readers that have read some other stuff on the emergence topic."
2,A strong beginning diminishes to a very weak ending.,"Johnson' book starts strong, with powerful clear examples of the emergence of complexity from simple organisms. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, this is an excellent introduction. Fortunately, I looked at it in a library before buying it, because he doesn't live up to the promise of his first strong examples. Instead, he drifts off into imaginative dribble about what the web might become, and turns clearity and specificity into vague ninety's hoopla that tells you nothing about emergence, or the web for that matter. The strong examples lead to a real disappointment with the book as a whole."
2,Professionals Be Warned...,"The examples in this book are built with a free product called WebMatrix. Most (if not all) professionals must use Visual Studio, which is the preferred development environment for all .NET languages. Learning ASP.Net programming without using Visual Studio will only take you half way to your goal.WebMatrix is also used as the Web Server, so you won't get IIS exposure. If you are a professional, or want to be one, look for a book that uses Visual Studio and IIS."
2,Weaker release than other eps and singles,"This single just did not really do it for me, whereas feed the wolf and destroy the robots had a great array of awesome songs, this single was kind of a let down.Rain is ok but the production lacks, the cancer song is just not good and just people & leaves is a good song but does not showcase what this band can do.The saving song here is the mothers remix of rain. It is a string, piano and acoustic version of the song and sounds wonderful as the angst of the original is removed and this version suits much more.Buy as you cant get these songs on any other releases, however persue feed the wolf or destroy the robots first."
5,I'm sold,"I've been using the soap for 2 weeks and I love it. I can actually feel the difference after a shower (it is a little strange seeing gray suds), I feel clean, but not dry.I've just recently started using it on my face, I'm very careful about what I put on my face as I am acne prone. No adverse reactions after a week. I also like the smell."
2,Not real Black Soap,"This isn't real african black soap..I tried it anyways because of the good reviews and all it did was break me out horribly and never healed even though I was patient with it. It does have a nice feel, but it has chemical ingredients too (like triclosan) and definitely isn't legit. Once I switched to a REAL african black soap, it cleared my skin within days. Just be aware that this isn't the real black soap you might be looking for, and although other people seem to like it anyways, it ruined my skin.The seller was great though and fast shipping, just not the product I thought it'd be."
3,I had to make it mine...,"I liked this quilting journal...okay...but it had too much information and wasted space on Lynette Jensen's quilting projects. I wanted it to be only about quilts I had made so I ended up tearing our a lot of pages of Lynette's stuff!All in all, I am glad I bought it!"
1,Not like described.,"Although I've seen some excellent reviews regarding 'ageing eyes', etc., this watch is difficult to see with the provided backlight. Even the daytime view leaves much to be desired. Doesn't appear as shown in the picture.I don't think the large hands provide for easy reading of digital either.I would prefer the T5E351, but don't want to take a chance without actually seeing it. I've already got one watch to return.If this watch interests you, I think you should find a store that has it. I've learned my lesson and hopefully you can benefit from it.Joe Balsamo"
4,"Great, stylish, inexpensive watch!","I ordered both this and the all stainless steel version. I am very pleased with both. I admit, I purchased the watches after seeing the movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"". Of course, the watch does not have all of the features that are in the movie but both watches are heavy, good quality & great looking. I just re-ordered the ""black"" watch after a quad accident this past weekend that deeply scratched the crystal and bezel. The watch is still working great but will now be used only for backpacking, quad riding and other outdoor activities where looks don't matter."
2,Flea Market Quality: Time Diverges,"While good-looking (I'm wearing it now), this watch has a certain cheapness about it. The digital and analog clocks work separately, and have been diverging at the rate of about 10 seconds a day, leaving me to wonder which (if either) is accurate. The second hand stops every second but never stops to point directly at one of the 60 evenly spaced time marks around the clock face. The beeps/alarms are not loud enough and do not keep going long enough at all. The countdown timers (only up to 99min59sec each) are cleared, not reset, by the ""reset"" button (they're reset by the ""set"") button. The disappearing digital is a neat trick, but it's just a trick, not backed by quality."
5,Great DVD,This DVD offers fantastic qualilty instruction. Very detailed. You can't go wrong for the price.
4,If you've read Infinite Jest and you're thinking of reading this...,"I got into DFW through Infinite Jest, and I wanted to see what his other novel was like.I thought it was pretty good, a good story, well written, with lots of interesting intertwined ideas. It's much easier to read than IJ. Again the chapters jump around in time a bit but at least at the start it's focused on the main character, so it's easier to work out what's happening and how the chapter fits into the story.It has all the awesome ""almost-sci fi"" elements that DFW is so good at.In a way it was nice that although the story arcs weren't completely spelled out, you get a pretty good idea of the conclusion. Unlike Infinite Jest which seems a bit too open by the end."
1,The short stories were better than the debacle that is this book.,"This is one of the reviews where I have so many things to complain about, but I honestly cannot be bothered. The female lead is a selfish woman who treats her significant other like trash. Mr Vigorous (said ""significant other"") is a swarthy obsessive creature. In fact, the highlight of the book was when, after she interrupts him for the umpteenth time, he reflexively calls her a ""bitch."" I was so elated by him finally finding a spine and saying what I had wanted to yell at her for so long that I expressed my happiness verbally outloud!The random short stories embedded in the book were actually quite fun. The primary plot of the book? So much navel-gazing I felt like someone had just completed their first philosophy class.Do not buy. It is as unsatisfactory as going to the toilet whilst badly constipated."
4,Mind-bending metafiction,"This wry novel of metafiction is entertaining exhaustment.Protagonist Lenore Beadsman is overwhelmedby offbeat events, including the disappearance of hergreat-grandmother Lenore Beadsman, her job as switchboardoperator at the publishing firm of Frequent and Vigorous, andthe demands of being an heiress to a Baby Food fortune.Frequently amusing, I highly recommend this novel- butadvise writing down a cast of characters as you go, forthere is a cast of (bizarre) hundreds."
4,loving the author,"really love his style. as i understand it, this was his first full book, so i'm really excited to read more if his work. this is definitely worth the read. takes a couple of chapters to get used to his style, but now i'm really in love with it."
1,Avoid Henckels Twinstar plus Knives Follow-up,"After notifying Henkals of my dissatisfaction with the product they promptly replaced them with a comparable 5-star set. No questions asked. I was very impressed with their response and am very satisfied with the 5-star set. Although I don't recomend the twinstar plus set, they make excellent cutlery overall and you cannot go wrong with a company like this."
3,"Amanda Quick's ""Scandal""","This is an early Amanda Quick but conforms well to her style. If you enjoy the Regency period romantic novel, with a touch of suspense, this is a good read."
4,Typical Quick - but not one of my favorites,"My favorite books by Amanda Quick are her books with one word titles - Deception, Ravished, Mystique,etc. For some reason, I didn't like Scandal quite as much. I think I had trouble with Emily's character traits - she seemed too innocent and naive at times. Nevertheless it was a fun read."
4,AR-15 Guide,"I have found this book a very useful tool on the ins and outs of the AR-15 rifle. Very comprehensive, and very detailed as to assembly and disassembly. Includes helpful hints on shooting the AR-15 for fun or competition."
2,"Price is Per Booda Bone, Not Three Pak","My dog loves these bones, the product itself would get a five star rating. The problem is that the price is for one bone when the picture shows three. Don't think you are getting three for the price shown."
1,wost wiper i have ever bought,This are the worst wipers I ever bought. Just after 5 minutes of working noise of these baldes become unberable. They squeek and make a lot of other noises. Wiping performane was ok.
2,Pass On This One,"While the acting is mostly good in this film (hence the 2-star rating), the fight scenes are dull, the special effects poorly done, and the storyline muddled.To make matters worse, the film doesn't have an ending... or rather, the ending is a cliffhanger that makes 'Back the Future 2' (for example) look like a complete story.I like my movies with beginning, middles, and ends, even if they are obviously setting up for a sequel. ""Reborn from Hell"" spent too much time setting up the conflicts and the bad guys and never delivered a proper pay-off."
2,samurai movie almost from hell,"this movie was pretty commical... too bad it wasn't a comedy. The special effects in the movie were pretty good for a Japanese movie made in 1995, but it's still funny. If you're looking for a good movie based on the same topic (jubei) watch ninja scroll. other than that, keep this one strictly to rental."
2,Not what I expected...,"Not what I expected... I thought it did duo patterns of rosettes, but only does one. I can't not use other Rosette patterns with the set. It doesn't remain the heat, so it took longer to make the cookies."

1,It's a leaky bucket! Don't waste your time or money!,I will never buy Nordic Ware again. This pan is a joke. I tested it with water and it leaks everywhere. There is no way that the bundt orthe regular pan could hold batter long enough to bake. I am glad that I tested this with water and not in my new oven. Anyone who poursbatter into this thing is going to have it everywhere. I plan to return this item a.s.a.p.I will never buy Nordic Ware again. If this is an example of the products they produce then I want no part of it.
3,Springform,I bought this a while ago. I still have it...it's a key baking dish to own. I know I have used it various times and still in great shape. The interior is really smooth and if you greese it properly things do not stick to it. I like it and it was such a good price.
4,DA Live At Cornerstone Y2K,"I really enjoy this CD. It makes me wish I could have been at this show. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is they did not do anything from my favorite DA album, Shotgun Angel. It's still a great disc anyways. It's a good introduction to a great band to anyone who has never had a chance to hear them."
2,lens fogging,The gauge seems acurate however the lens fogs up after a little cool air hits it.quite irratating.
2,Not much help,"Tired concepts, outdated ideas, and transparent gimmicks. I would not use these ideas and if I were a client I would not fall for them. Pretty much a waste of money."
5,Work great,I have a 36 year old version of this iron and this one worked exactly the same way. Love It.
1,Linwood Barclay's best drivel yet!!,"For years now I've been perusing Barclay's columns in my favourite newspaper. Mostly by accident, when I the headlines are misleading. I'm familiar with his ball-peen sharp wit and honed sense of irrelevance. And yet this book managed to astound me. Just looking at the picture on this website managed to astound me. And Barclay complaining in print that he didn't have a review, even a negative review by someone who hasn't read the book, has nothing to do with anything."
3,Info. on the products,"If you've bought this set, can you share what you think of the crib bumper? Does it have ties on top and bottom? Is it firm? Anything else we should be aware of? Thanks!"
5,Excellent!,"Elizabeth Lowell does not disappoint! As usual, an intriguing story, a strong woman, a great location and a fascinating compelling man. Elizabeth Lowell has an amazing ability to write historical and modern fiction. Her contemporaries are particularly enjoyable because of the strong women characters, who are independent and have a life."
5,Elizabeth Lowell book,Needed this book to balance the first book called FEVER of hers.. they shipped fastI like to get books fast so if your wanting to continue more of the story here it wasalready to go.
3,Check the copyright date,"This was listed on Amazon as being published in Dec.09, so I was surprised to receive it right away. Expecting a new work, I was surprised to find that the copyright date is 1988 - obviously a reprint of an earlier work. I wish that had been mentioned on the initial review."
2,Too obvious,"This stuff is all pretty obvious and can be learned anywhere, not just in the environment of a SEAL team. We could have called this ""Leadership Lessons of the Plastic Injection Molding Production Supervisors"" or ""Leadership Lessons of the Rental Car Management Trainees."" Seriously. The SEAL stories were nice, but I was expecting some powerful lessons learned under the stressful conditions of special operations combat. The ""how many officers does it take to put up a tent"" example wasn't exactly the impactful example that I was looking for. I, too, was a naval officer and could generate better illustrations of these leadership and management skills from my mundane times on a surface ship. No need to slap the SEAL trident on the cover, though I guess it would sell more books."
5,"Finally...drop the feel good bs, and learn to actually LEAD","I found this book to be extremely straight forward, simple to understand, useful, and applicable to a wide variety of of settings. Simply put, whether you lead from a board room or a locker room, you're spinning your wheels unless you understand and/or follow these basic leadership principles. I'm absolutely sick of wasting my time sitting in pointless meetings, and meandering around in circles with well-intentioned, but unfocused MANAGERS when what is really needed are LEADERS. This book uses time-tested (and battle-tested), proven approaches to define your mission, build a winning team that people are proud to be part of, and kick butt! The SEALS have been doing this since their inception, and it's just plain common sense to learn from their experience.It's refreshing to finally read about the SEAL culture, and not be inundated with self flatuating hero worship. This book will help you build a winner...you can't lead from the rear!"
5,Very good quality,I have been buying Bob's Red Mill gluten free flours but thought I would give these Barry Farm products a try. I have been very happy with the results and would highly recommend them.
1,Don't buy,DisC won't play. It has a regional code error meaning its from another country. Won't play in a US bought player
3,my science project movie,the movie looks good but it lacks a better definition than other movies from its time and the wide screen format is very thik in the top and bottom margins so it makes the movie to look smaller...any way its a good movie ...i enjoyed.
4,Excellent 80s Nostalgia,"As some others have said, ""My Science Project"" is pure 80s absurdity - but that doesn't make it a bad thing. With surprisingly high production values and a premise that was every misfit's high school dream (as in saving the day, getting the girl, and winning the respect of your peers), it's hard for an 80s-born nerd such as myself NOT to enjoy it. Since I was a kid I've always had a soft spot for this cheesy flick, and it hasn't changed with time. It may be too campy for much of today's audience, but it's jam-packed with that nostalgic 80s flavor and some really fun moments."
4,Horror Fantic,"Hello,I once again saw this when I was a kid. I really only loved the movie for the simple fact of muscle car invovled. All around a good movie. Good story and great ending!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"The band's biggest song, and their weakest EP","Pavement always released excellent EPs, full of bonus songs that aimed to please their fans. ""Cut Your Hair,"" however, was the weakest of these EPs, an irony as the single was the band's big cross over hit. The extra two songs are decent, lo-fi Pavement songs that represent ""Slanted and Enchanted"" at it's laziness, as opposed to the indie pop of ""Crooked Rain."" The cover of REM's Camera builds rather nicely, and Malkmus sings with feeling. ""Stare,"" however, doesn't go anywhere and is one of the bands weakest songs. If you like the single, you're much better off getting the album which contains more songs in a similar vein. If you like the band and want to get into their EPs, check out any other release aside from this one."
5,This House of Sky,"If you care for exquisite use of the English language; descriptions that take your breath away, and a depth of feeling unequaled in any literature written in the past twenty years this is the book for you. This House of Sky is a memoir/ autobiography of a man who grew up in the remote plains and mountains of Montana. He was surrounded by hardship and grief, but he coped with it all. Ivan Doig, the author, is an only child who lost his mother the day he turned six. He became the sidekick of his father who made frequent visits to saloons and had many unusual acquaintances. The boy learned many lessons from these early days of sheepherding and visiting with adults, His father had one more marriage which was a disaster before his life changed for the better.The story captivated me and made me think about family relationships and how they form one's personality.This is not a ""page turner"" with many violent experiences falling one on top of another.It is a book to savor"
4,What's family?,"If there is any question in your mind about the need for,and value of, a son's relationship with his father, read this book. In a much more straight forward and honest way than the much better known 'Angela's Ashes' this book shows how a father and grandmother give life, and make the necessary changes to insure this one boy not only survives, but thrives.Through some of the most unbelievable circumstances and struggle, a father shows his son what it means to be a man, and how to grow into the job. Light hearted at times, serious at times, through the cycles of life and death in the real world they make it, and grow from it.What more could you ask? It's real."
4,Leap frog game,Grandchildren enjoy using the Leapster. Provides them with learning opportunities while having fun. Both the 5 year old and the 3 year old can use this game.
5,My 5 year-old's favorite Leapster game!,"My five year-old chooses this game over Spongebob, Cars, and Dora just about every time he plays! It's awfully fun and cute, with the carnival-style games like popping balloons. He also loves making the characters jump, bounce on the trampoline, and hang from the tightrope as they move to catch letters and spell short words. As they play games and collect tickets, they can buy monster parts and build a dancing monster. My son LOVES feeding the tickets to the ticket machine (it reminds me of the Chuck E Cheese ticket machine!) The games themselves are fun, but this added motivation is icing for the cake!By the way, my son got a Gameboy Advance from my mother-in-law for Christmas, but he hardly plays it. He still very much prefers his Leapster games!"
4,Great content - terrible interface,"Make no mistake about it, the articles here are wonderful; and since they're in straight HTML you ought to be able to extract what your're after by exploring the disk by hand. Every article is included, from 1928 on.Unfortunately, it comes with a very lame and very broken Java based search mechanism. Heaven knows why they did not just provide a text file with a list of the article titles.The additional disk of demo software is extremely modest, and adds little to the package."
1,The New Pressure Cooker Cookbook,This is not one of my favorite cook books. There are no pictures and the recipies are odd. Who would want to eat Oxtails with Chinese flavor? The binding is not condusive to a cookbook.
3,So-So,I was a little disappointed in the choice and amount of recipes. The cooking chart wasn't very well organized.
5,Great value,"I bought these as I transition from the working world back to school and did not want to spend hundreds of dollars on pots and pans. These were a great deal as I got them for $99 and then $30 off for a promotion on Amazon. They feel very sturdy and just like others have written, nothing sticks to them!"
4,Dannie; a tale of the Galveston Hurrican of 1900,"I also read and loved this book as a youth and would very much love to read it again. It is a special book for me as I was born and raised in Texas City which is just across Galveston Bay from Galveston. I spent many, many happy days visiting family in Galveston. I love the palm trees and beautiful old homes."
5,Very good for beginners like me!,"I have learned 68000 family assembly and hardware and now i am entering the Intel family. I didn't know that studying this book can make things so easy! The authors really make things simple and clear, and yet all the important points are there! And the examples are simple and straightforward, and they do serve their purpose in explaining concepts! I fully recommend for beginners in assembly and microprocessors."
4,cute fall time story,"Minnie and Moo is an exciting and funny adventure of farm animals who find themselves in hilarious encounters with their human counterparts on Halloween night. The story takes the reader through a wild ride of imagination as we once again follow the crazy antics of Minnie and Moo and their barnyard friends, that all begins with a wild dream and a fantastic ride on a bed through the farm and into town. It is great to read about the crazy situations that the farm animals get into as they try to fill two pillowcases with candy by trick or treating!The pictures in the story are very colorful and add a lot to the story. This is one story that my son couldn't get enough of. He had to read it more than once! This is a great fall time story to share with your family."
4,One does it all.,I like the fact that one device dose it all instead of switching around to different size balls. However the coating on it will come off with just a one time use of it. I went from South Florida to North Carolina pulling a trailer with 2 motercycles and by the time i got there the back coating was gone on that particular ball. You will need then to maintain it to prevent it from rusting. Very resistent and a good value. Good Luck..
5,Great product!!,These installation kits are extremely expensive when bought from a car stereo shop! Got this one for a fraction of the price and am not disappointed at all! Works perfectly!
5,Tachometer performance,"This Sunpro Mini Tachometer performs as stated. This low-cost instrument is installed on an engine stand with a freshly rebuilt 350 SBC. I have also mounted Sunpro mini gauges for water temp, oil pressure, and system voltage. All the instruments work as designed and offer reliable readings."
4,Worth it,"Even for some of you who HATE Asian elements in your games, it's still worth it. A lot of it is pretty jank (cool), for those who lke monks, this is a must have. It adds a bundle of Martial arts feats. The races are a bit odd, but they are creative. I like the Nezumi the best; they are small rat people. The classes are great, except I dislike the Shugenja, but the Sohei is cool. The Samurai could have been done beter though he needs more special abilities.The monsters are strange, but the Pennagolan (Oriental Vamps), Hopping Vampire (A feral version of the vamp), and the Oni (Oriental Demons)are great.The biggest letdowns were the religious system. The system was kind of like Shinto, the native religion of Japan instead of doing it the D&D polytheism way. The other letdown was the fact that they did Rokugan instead Kara-Tur.Overall, It was worth it , though it did cost a lot."
2,Not concise or direct,"I wish I could give it 2 stars and a half. This could have been a great book but I feel Strang, in his attempts to simplify the topic, actually made it more convoluted through needless discussions and verbiage. I was quite frustrated at times trying to dissect the purpose of 2-3 paragraph long discussions. Finding a result you want is even worse, akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Despite all of this, I still managed to learn from it which goes to show the amount of thought Strang probably put into this work.Although this book was not my particular cup of tea, I am sure there are many others who would enjoy Strang's deliberate avoidance of mathematical language."
4,Can't Stop Makin' Tarts!,"This is a great tart pan if you like to make deep dish quiches, etc. The false bottom comes in handy for easy removal of the tart, but be careful when loading it into the oven! While the sides of the pan are non-stick, the bottom is not. The sides and bottom should be buttered well. I would reccomend this pan to anybody who has always wanted to made tarts!"
3,Pretty Good,This does crave your appetite; if you make sure you follow; the instruction; you can eat less; other than that; anyone will not follow the instuction; then you will indulge too much; I suppose it depends on the average person as well.
1,Product not as advertised,"Particularly bought this product as it was Purple in color and the color that was asked for by a family member for the holidays.The black flashlight that was sent, works and is the product it should be, however, it wasn't purple, will never be purple and still not sure why I got sent black"
5,GRANDMA'S COOKBOOK,"As a new cook, i found the text easy to ready and quite informative. I strongly suggest buying this book, it is probably the best cookbook today. My grandma wrote this book for father who has now given it to me."
2,Feel taken advantage of,"This pressure washer extension hose was recommended to be bought with the pressure washer I purchased. However, it does not work with my pressure washer without an additional part I had to purchase. Hopefully when the part arrives I will be able to use the extension. I feel taken advantage of by Amazon.com for recommending this extension."
4,good price,"price was right. Nice, bought a pressure washer needed a hole. found it on Amazon for a great price fits perfect on my washer..."
5,"""Smells Like Fish But It Tastes Like Pain""","This movie Rocks.Funny as hell!!! From the creator of Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter.This is the story of Harry Knucles the Not-So-Secret-Banana-Eater-Super-Agent who has to recover a mysterius pearl neklace stolen by a Gigantic Bionic Big Foot.With the help of his luchador friend El Santos he goes on a quest against nuns,ninjas and sexy spies. The fight scenes are ""classic B rated jewels"" and it got a great story lines and Dark humor (Ie. There's a wrestling move called ""Turbo Gerbil"" Not gonna explain it).There's also a breaktrough in musical Montage never seen before I wont tell cause I dont wanna spoil it for you. This movie includes the original Harry Knucles short that inspire the movie and a bunch of extras .If you are a fan of B movies, independent films and funny one liners this is a must have."
3,This Movie is something,"Now, I know buying this movie that it would probably not be very good, and I was correct. I did underestimate how little it would make sense. There is a robotic bigfoot, and a 20 minutes wrestling scene for almost no reason. That being said, I am glad I bought it, but it is not as good as JC vampire Hunter."
3,tach,Tach works great. Too bad they give you a mount for a larger tach. I set the gage too far from the column. I had to create my own.
4,It fit but it smelled?,I had no complaints with the condom; it fit well on a very thick member but my boyfriend said it smelled of latex too much?
2,Was a good book but...,"much has happened since. This is now looking dated. This was *the* original book on OLE, however, with the subsequent advent of COM, COM+, ActiveX, ATL and .NET means that this book is now something of a period piece. However, the underlying concepts still exist in the majority of PC installations and applications in use today (although expect that to diminish in coming years). OLE (later to become COM and later COM+) had some wonderful, ground-breaking features from an architectural perspective but often the implementation details were very ugly (the Registry, GUIDs, non-unique interfaces, reference counting, etc.). Fortunately, .NET seems to have captured all of the good points, very few of the bad points of OLE, COM, COM+, Java, C++ and VB."
4,Two weeks to perform Romeo And Juliet? No problem!,"This book follows some middle school kids in their attempt to perform the play ""Romeo and Juliet"", but the play is just an excuse to try to get two of their friends together (they have cast them as Romeo and Juliet). Unfortunately, they do not realize that they need much more than two weeks to get the play off the ground. But, that's all the time they have.This book is wonderfully funny and imaginative. I recently read it to my sixth graders, and they really enjoyed it."
4,"Romance, silly middle-school style","Middle school age kids attempt to play matchmaker for a pair of bashful peers by developing their own production of Shakespeare's classic with those two shy folks in the lead roles. The characters are very age-appropriate in interaction and approach to the production's challenges. This makes for some funny results in terms of such things as costuming and timing and forgotten lines and/or actions and adolescent ego. This would be a good way for a youngster to get his or her first taste of The Bard, a source many youngsters see as intimidating. The kids' loyalties, friendships, and social observations and dislikes ring true. Having read several of Avi's other works before, this is just one more that shows him to be a consistently reliable choice of author for young people."
1,Squeaky Toy,"I have had no luck with these Rockport ""Active Air"" shoes. The air chamber ends up punctured and you end up walking around in a pair of doggie toys.I actively avoid any shoes with these air pockets after having to toss three or four pair. At least the description here gives you a warning, sometimes you do not know until it is too late."
1,Very Disappointing Pan But Great Service From Amazon,"This is the first review I have ever written. I was very excited to use this product but after my first use this morning, I am left with a pan that I must throw away. As recommended by the recipes I consulted, I used bamboo skewers to turn the pancakes. The nonstick surface is scratched, and therefore unsafe to use again. Also, the strawberry jam I used to fill the ebelskivers is permanently crusted onto the ""nonstick"" surface. I had very high hopes for this pan, but I am extremely frustrated and disappointed. UPDATE: I did not have good results with the pan, but Amazon is fabulous (five stars for Amazon!). I returned the pan for a full refund and they even paid shipping. Thank you, Amazon!"
5,We love it.,"I stumbled upon a video online for making Aebelskiver so I ordered it just for fun. What a blast. You can easily search online for a simple recipe as well as some good videos on how to properly flip them. They came out perfect the first time. I showed my teenage son and his friends and they went nuts. The family has had a great time making these and trying different topings and fillings. You can serve these about 900 different ways. Since the balls themselves aren't overly sweet you can pair them with jams, sauces, chocolate, whipped cream, fruit filling, etc. One of the best purchases we ever made."
2,Scratched teflon on all pancake inserts!!!!!,"The product was new but had scratches on ALL the teflon for each pancake! I was very disappointed with this. It came with original packaging but was obviously scratched everywhere on the bottoms and sides of each pancake insert. Again, very disappointing."
2,would not recommend,the finish scratches VERY easilyI used wood chopsticks to turn them over and the wood even scratched the finish.seems like a poorly made product
3,We were not impressed,"I bought two sets of these drum sticks for my sons, who have been drumming on everything around the house with chop sticks. They opened them, put them in the closet and I haven't seen them since. The sound of the drum is not ""real"" sounding and they are confusing to operate."
1,Pray before Removing Cake,"Since its first use, I literally pray the cake will be easy to remove when its done. So far this pan has disappointed virtually every time, and even rurined perfectly good items, that I wanted to sell professionally.It is a nightmare, save yourself alot of problems. Any decent Bundt Pan can bake a good cake, but there are ones much easier to remove the cake from the pan from.I am presently in the market for a bundt pan, and searched it on Amazon. This popped up. I literally shuttered."
4,What a Heavenly Pot,I love this pot. I just made a French Vanilla cake with Sprinkles and needless to say it came out perfect. I love how fluffy my cake was. The only flaw with my cake was it wasn't even. I didn't give it a chance to become even before putting it in the oven. The good thing. NO on noticed. The cake was great. I even heated the icing and poured it over the cake. Everyone loved it.The only downside for me was cleaning. Normally I can let my pans soak for a couple of minutes to return to my pot without cake left on it. Well that didn't happen with this one. I had to wipe kind of hard to get it out. I did flour my pan so I know that wasn't the case.I love this pot and every cake I make will be made in this pot.
1,MINE ONLY CAME WITH 1 OF THE 4 PROTECTIVE FEET PADS,"I LIKE THE SIZE AND ITS A NICE PRODUCT, BUT IT WAS APPARENTLY JUST TOSSED IN A BOX BECAUSE 3 OF THE 4 WHITE PROTECTIVE FOOT PADS WHERE MISSING AND THERE WAS NO TAPE OR PACKAGING PROTECTION TO PREVENT THEM FROM FALLING OFF.THEY WHERE NOT GLUE ON, THE 1 WAS JUST STUCK ON SO THE MISSING 3 COULD EASILY HAVE FALLING OFF PRIOR TO SHIPPING AND I FEEL THAT PROMOTING THE PRODUCT STATING PROTECTIVE FEET IN THE TITLE IS VERY MISLEADING........"
5,"The affective, emotional and relational aspects of learning","In an educational research and practice world dominated by reductivist, decontextualized, disembodied assumptions of cognition - this book is a much-needed challenge to educational researcher and practitioners. Garrison's book illuminates the role of the affective in learning, the emotion in motivation and relational aspects of learning. Garrison's discussion of the role of the precognitive and selective attention in the cognitive process is largely ignored in the field overall. A must read."
5,Book review,This book is a terrific one for graduate courses and for leisure time reading. I was out of town and Amazon had this book on my doorstep waiting for me. Thank you...
3,Not what it claims,"If this pan is heavy weight, I would hate to see the light weight version. If you are looking for a heavy pan this is not it. Have not used it, but will try hopefully it bakes better that it appears to."
3,Eh...,"Well...most of the songs on here are good and everything but there was really only about 3 songs we haven't heard before on it. They have a lot of different types of songs, and some are styles you haven't heard from ICP. Like Take Me Home and Fly Away are different then their usual type of song, and they are cool. But this CD is still a dissapoint b/c we've heard most of it, and they have other things they could have put on this CD. Oh well, still pick it up if you're a juggalo. If you aren't, I'd suggest something else from ICP, such as Riddle Box"
